235601,0,t3_1wt62w,Yeah Im pretty confident it could fail now. We have to remember that in episode  or  her father ? was saying that she was not ready to wear it. That right there implies bad things would happen if she does. Now we see that Junketsu feeds off of her and impairs her body like the parasite it is. I have a feeling that Senketsu goes berserk when Ryuko is mentally unstable and Junketsu goes berserk when Satsuki is physically unstable as in very weak and essentially beaten.,KillLaKill,cf564ev,11,t5_2yn47
237201,0,t1_cf53vjf,Yes I would love if the second half was a Satsuki revenge arc. I just thought Its gotten very Kill Bill.

271439,0,t1_cf8t5sg,Yeah I liked that too. Its been a few years since Ive had this in school but if I remember correctly it has many meanings. One of them I think is the difference between what something seems to be and how it actually is in reality. Sort of things arent what they appear to be.  Considering that Nui looks and acts like a cute little girl who could do no harm but is actually one of the most dangerous characters in the show its a pretty fitting description for her.,KillLaKill,cf8w8e7,7,t5_2yn47

648082,0,t3_21k9o2,I dont think it was a date. I think if Mako had asked her on a romantic date she would have been blushing and she wasnt she just stared at her. Plus on the date they werent holding hands or anything just going out doing girl stuff you know. While I was being yelled at on tumblr for being upset over not being as much Gamako as I hoped I got this nice reply sort of breaking it down a littleand im new reddit so Im sorry if my anime spoiler didnt workAnime Spoilers Im gonna write this under a readmore even if its really short because of spoilerstuff!I dont know. I mean yes the episode has big RyuMako vibes what with the lecture having shippy pics such as Ryuko and Mako KISSINGalbeit shoddily and funnily and Ryuko and Mako as schoolboy and schoolgirl in a bench aww. But I guess the episode was quite equal in parts and let the shippers have their field day depending of their favorite?Like the teasing at the end with Gamagoori being just about asking Mako out probably. Yea Mako looked very excitedly having fun with Ryuko in a peaceful world also with Oneesama Satsuki heh. But I think everyones forgetting the utter  change of personality that Mako had when Gamagoori died. Were those the faces of someone who was indifferent to Gamagori?She didnt fight comically serious as shed usually do with her lectures being all with her usual cheery yet willful voice and everything. No. She was fighting with her head slightly down a frown in her face and her voice was of a dreadfulness not even heard of during Episode  when trying to bring Ryuko back or even Episode  after almost killing Ryuko.And then the usual happy and willful Mako coming back after GamagoriSenpai turning out being alive!Okay I cant deny any possibility of RyuMako. I cant stomp on RyuMakos parade and go on and say Your ship isnt real even if they kissed in the lecture haha she was just being platonic friends hurdurp because I dont know I may have my thoughts to it I definitely consider it a possibility but I honestly prefer IraMako IDKwhy but ultimately if theyre happy with their ship being canon to their eyes yay? I consider my ship not being canonically the canoniest canon in the canonverse but with strong hints of having been true albeit not fulfilled by any of the parts in a series primarly about very Shounen fights and the romance not being a focal point.Im also pretty puzzled by the lack of NononxSatsuki in Tumblr overall even if that one is pretty onesided unlike IraMako or RyuMako. But oh well.tldr idkbroor sis or dude or whatever pronoun you prefer though I use bro to everyone I think IraMako is quite in par with RyuMako and theres a big cute evidence! And dont let bad shippers of any side rain on the parade I! D,KillLaKill,cgdxqz1,33,t5_2yn47

But Satsuki and Ryuuko have both completed their arcs and overcome their flaws although Im still a bit confused at what the hells going on with Satsuki at the end there. There isnt really anywhere for them to grow..

You dont think Ryuko just transformed into a skimpy costume more than she just changed into her battle mode.

The ideas for the episodes werent very good in my opinion and the action was pretty bland. But thats just how I feel.In comparison to KLK you can say its similar in the sexualness. Both sets of main characters use their clothes as weapons although PSG goes farther and has sex scenes doesnt actually show sex if its happening its pretty much just a shadow. PSG doesnt really have much of a plot until the end I mean yeah theres the setting about how theyre angels that were kicked out of heaven and theyre trying to get back in but they didnt expand much on that. KLK had a great plot and line of events so if youre using it as a bar to see how good PSG is then it will fall short on that and many other fronts.It seems as though a lot of people in this thread enjoyed it a lot so you can try and find out for yourself. Its only  episodes so its not very timeconsuming.,KillLaKill,cpxb1s1,1,t5_2yn47
