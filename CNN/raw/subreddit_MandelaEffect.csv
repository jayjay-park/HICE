There was no the vampire chronicles when it was A. That is a pretty BIG omission.. Secondly this is about what people see hear. This is not just tricking the one sense. I know what you are saying but were dealing with multiple senses. What you have done is give people something that they could maybe understand. Its just not correct. I understand what you are saying but we dont know your motives. You have to understand your perception is your own. You cannot try to group these things and if you understand the human psyche that is what happens. Your perception is your own. What your brain decodes is your own. ,MandelaEffect,cq0inge,-3,t5_2zejk
3584568,0,t1_cq0v06m,If the keychain had disappeared off say my kitchen counter then reappeared a day or week later then Id probably put my money on the more paranormal end of things. But since it had been stolen and gone for so many years I consider it a Mandela Effect. Same as the car I also believe it to be that way. The reason is I do believe in the multiple universes each one just off by one thing from the other.  And the SO and I have both had some pretty damn close calls in the almost dying department so if there is such a thing as quantum suicide and immortality then it stands to reason in one of those weve kicked the bucket and ended up here. And there are these little differences weve both noticed. I know he had one he talked about a couple months ago but I cant remember off the top of my head at the moment. Thing about some Mandela Effects is that not all of them would they be such famous examples like Mandelas death and such. In fact I think if the quantum immortality is true wed slip over to the universe that most closely resembles ours but has the tiny little things off the mark so as not to be too much of a shock you know? Now about glitches if I were to believe in the hypothesis that we are in a computer simulation well then I would think things like suddenly seeing the sky go black or seeing everyone freeze up at the same time etc. to be an actual glitch. Theres just so many possibilities for everything though and some things are hard to lump in together or to try and separate. I just have my own little classification for such things but mostly sticking to the broad generalizations everyone else gives to the paranormal circumstances of the Mandela Effect and glitches in the matrix. ,MandelaEffect,cq0vape,3,t5_2zejk

4753134,1,t1_ctsv70y,We did not switch.  Two very similar realities merged.  This happens on a regular basis and a lot of what people chalk up to defective memory is actually the result of remembering things which are inconsistent with the facts preserved in the merged reality as opposed to the facts as they were prior to the merging.Have you every gone looking for something remembered where you put it found it not to be there looked all over for it looked again where it was supposed to be and found it right there where it was supposed to be in plain sight such that you cannot possibly figure out how you did not see it in the first place?  That kind of stuff happens often to just about everyone.  Those are not mental glitches.  They are glitches from merging realities.  The cool thing about the Berenstin Bears Problem is that this time the glitch is big enough for a LOT of people to notice the kind of people who never previously thought about the nature of the spacetime continuum.,MandelaEffect,cttoeuu,-3,t5_2zejk

4802743,0,t3_3gneun,Okay so check this out.Click on that link. In early  its spelled Berenstein on the website. A few months later in  and from the rest of time onward it is spelled as Berenstain.However check out the source on the image of the bears in April  compared to the source of the image in June . The file name in BOTH instances is berenstein.jpg as is the web address and this leads me to believe this whole deal stems from a misspelling that over time got phased out. The fact that there are numerous forum and blog archives which contain the ein spelling compared to every image of the books in circulation displaying the ain spelling is the proof in the pudding for me. Not to mention Berenstain isnt a very common word at all and its one more known by its pronunciation than its spelling i.e. we hear it more than we read it.Any thoughts? Im damn near convinced this explains it.EDIT To give you information on where I stand my sister told me about this whole dilemma and I had no idea what to think.

Im suggesting MAYBE maps are being intentionally altered something that would be near impossible to prove without a hard copy of a map which I do not have.  All Im saying is the maps might not be changing out of thin airsomebody might be purposely changing them.  Youre calling BS on an extremely speculative theory Ive proposedwhich is completely fair.  But asking for proof of my theory is like asking me to prove the existence of the illuminati. Im not even saying this is what I believe.  Im throwing a theory out there.  I dont believe anything when it comes to this stuff to do so would be idiotic.  All we can have are ideas and concepts. If the powers that be do exist and they ARE altering their maps for whatever sort of political control it might gain them I am fairly certain they would be doing so in a way that would preclude a mere law student like myself from proving it.  My entire post is an entirely speculative idea of why certain historical events might be remembered differently i.e. because their historical metadata has been erased and altered to fill a certain agenda. ,MandelaEffect,cxcwjaw,3,t5_2zejk

Theres a theory out there that when you die you get pushed into an alternate universe where you didnt die. But for some reason you retain your old memories. However if you dont recall dying then I think that this may have to do with CERN. They have been causing a lot of havoc lately. They ran a major test between November rd and Decemberth so maybe you were pushed into an alternate universe during their test runs. I personally would subscribe to the quantum immortality theory but theres one flaw which is that you would be the only person noticing the differences not everyone else.

Of course not and so theres a certain amount of estimation involved there. Probably not an error margin of a billion but its certainly impossible to say that a certain person is the  billionth to be born or even just that the  billionth birth happened on a given day.I mean you have to account for the fact that people arent just born but around once per person they die as well. There are people being born and dying constantly so being the  billionth person to be born and be alive is a very shortlived title.In fact the sheer meaninglessness of what this show was apparently saying makes me wonder maybe you misunderstood or misremembered and in fact it wasnt the  billionth member of the population but the  larger numberth human to be born ever. Its still a ridiculous assertion wed have no way of knowing to even the slightest bit of accuracy but at least its a title that means something.Then again if were talking about numerology here considering deep meaning is maybe not the most fruitful line of inquiry...To sum up this radio show hardly seems like a good source of information here so maybe they didnt even bother to find an accurate number for the worlds population.,MandelaEffect,d0haiad,2,t5_2zejk

6822698,0,t1_d0pm1hw,Meditation does help me cope with my life and could be done for that reason alone.  But when I took psychedelics and meditated simultaneously I had some very powerful experiences which showed me that The world is not merely dead matter as I once believed.  Beyond our everyday ordinary experiences there are levels of reality that defy words. That we are not merely flesh and blood that were actually some sort of hyperdemensonal being casting its shadow into this reality as McKenna said. That the whole Cosmos is conscious and holographic All you need to do to experience this for yourself is take a large amount of mushrooms or smoke DMT just once. I believe the ME is a peak into that fact. Spacetime itself has changed and we for whatever reason remember how it once was. So I meditate because I believe it is a sober way to develop ones consciousness to the point where these profound ways of experiencing reality become part of everyday life. Psychedelics can take you there but you wont stay in that world. It is very dangerous to take them without showing them sacred respect. Think of meditation as climbing a mountain on foot psychedelics are like taking a lift to the top and then coming back down. In an ideal world mushrooms and meditation would be used together in a monistic setting. It would change the world ,MandelaEffect,d0pngrb,3,t5_2zejk

7208596,0,t3_4e4aco,Youre close but there is a slight nuance I feel I should add.Just thinking about something isnt what manifests it. Otherwise any porn obsessed virgin would be swimming in women.It is true you probably experience it as if that were true but that has to do with your intention as well!In order for it to work you have to envision yourself already experiencing mandela effects not desiring it. Desire is a tricky thing as it only ensnares you into more desire see buddhism.When you think I WILL experience an ME then the universe automatically manifests the implication namelyThis person has not yet experienced an ME but has the desire to do so. Hence  ironically preventing it!There is one exceptionloophole thoughbtw you might fall into this category that is if you are completely convinced that simply thinking  about something will manifest it in the way you want  to you regardless of phrasing then it WILL manifest  it like that regardless. because now the universe has the implicationwhatever is thought about is manifested only in the way. There is a catch though creating a foundation like this requires a lot of effort. It is far simpler to simply pretend as if it were truethink about what you do in a bad dream you put your hands before your eyes and go nanana the monster is now gone and lo and behold it is so.When you say It will manifest then it is likely you subconsciously already feel as if you exists in a world where MEs happen. This is what actually makes the ME happen! Not the thoughts!A powerful  being can even make objects move by feeling like it is moving or like feeling like it should obey the beings mind. Indeed trough perfection of your mind you can even change your whole reality on a whim! Time travelEnhancing your properties spooky skeletonsdeities dimensional jumpingmultiverse theory... It is all possible!Also I see something very positive about your posts indeed both compassion and thankfulness are the number one hidden power a human has. You dont have to think it but feel it. Even just pretending will help. This creates a pattern. The universe will create the implications this person has a lot to be thankful for and the universe is filled with compassion and make it so.This is because emotions trump thoughts in manifesting power. Also acting trumps even that! So helping people out of compassion does A LOT of good.Hence the idea of heaven for good peopleIf you keep doing this you will become a powerful manifestation of compassion a deity. If additionally you remain unattached to the pleasure that you will undoubtedly experience you will become wise and will transcend even the gods. This will lead to enlightenment. Being a compassionate god itself is pleasurable mind you but it just isnt permanent. Eventually you will forget the compassionthankfulness element and begin being prideful. Hence the cycle begins anew. This is something only a fully realized being can permanently escape!I feel you have a strong intuition hence why I feel the need to post all of this. I am convinced you are capable of realization.,MandelaEffect,d1xk6w4,6,t5_2zejk

I dont see a lamp thats pretty obviously a flower and Id peg the light beam as its scent being depicted. But Im not an Egyptologist so Id probably concede to their perspectives as having way more contextual framework than my own. That carving typo is pretty awesome though. I didnt realize that stone could be reused like a palimpsest. I would have assumed that if it was important enough to carve into rock the first time it would be important enough to keep. But thats MY stcentury bias showing assuming that the labor intensity of carving words into rock would dissuade people from doing lessthancrucial things. Someday people who have never held a pen or typed on a keyboard are going to be so surprised that we spent so much time writing shit down instead of simply dictating it to the machines implanted in our brains.

My theory is that its possible to change historical events by modifying the current state one of the limitless possible events from the superpositioned state could be decohered and at the same time parts of the universal current state related to the event would cohere and jump back into superposition. The massive energy barriers that hold matter together and normally keep this kind of thing from happening being overcome by tunneling.ampnbspSuperpositioning is where a collection of waves representing various possibilities are folded and packed together in a bundle an example would be a Gaussian impulse Coherence is one of the unique properties of LASER light.

7781982,0,t3_4lwauq,Interesting thoughts and questions! Im sure psychiatrists would like to put people experiencing the Mandela Efect or Matrix Glitches in a specific catagory. Like false memoriescollective hysteriagroup hysteria even schizophrenia ect... But for so many to experience a plethora of different or the same types of glitches and calmly talk about them in online forms makes me think something else is going on. Many have the same types of memory changes like someone famous dying and finding out they arent dead. Putting your keys down turn around and they are gone only to appear a while later exactly where you remembered putting them. Or looking at a map and seing a change that others see as well. My thoughts are that the changes in Earths magnetic field is causing a warp a bleed through of alternateinterdimensionalparallel universes andor that we are able to seeexperience these changes energetically. The morphing of earths magnetic field is like a wave that rises and falls very quickly and the oscillations are minute but distinct. This change may be affecting human consciousness increasing short term memory anomalies and even our biology.Weve all heard many stories on the subject. For instance altered timelines If you make a life altering change in this life  your timeline changes allowing you to stumble into the intersecting timeline of your alternates giving you a split second glimpse of the other you doing something else or cities being seen in the sky around the world the escalation of children remembering past lives or the increase in people feeling they are not the sex they should be. The perturbations of the magnetic field could be making distinct changes in our memories and our nervous system creating sleeping disorders waking visions ect...Its without a doubt something that should be discussed! ,MandelaEffect,d3qqw1v,2,t5_2zejk

7904076,0,t3_4ndp4c,How I feel about the Mandela effect. Realistic and skeptical thoughts.. Some of the suggestons proofIt seems that a lot of the examples of things changing are easily identifiable by a lot of people ex. Oscar MayerOscar Meyer Expression of Mona lisa noticeable smirk before presumed unnoticeable Movie titles such as Interview With A Vampire to Interview With The Vampire and so on. If you watch the Star Wars line on youtube where Darth Vader is supposed to say Luke I am your Father he for some reason says No I am your father. People who have the old VHS copy of the movie have reported that the original line Luke I am your father was still intact in the movie. So if the Mandela effect is real how can that be? Someone on youtube is obviously pulling your leg and it is working.But why is it the more you think about these changes the more you feel embraced in what one might call a new reality? For example when I first noticed a change in the Oscar Mayer spelling I had no idea what the Mandela Effect even was but I specifically remember shopping at the grocery store and saying it outloud when did this change Oscar Mayer spelling. That was probably about  years ago.This week I spontaneously started digging into the Mandela Effect and have been reviewing as much of the information as I can. One moment it will feel as if I have reached some type of break through where Ill feel like this mandela effect is in fact some sort of undeniable truth that feels like it makes too much sense to dismiss.Then  minutes later I will begin to call myself crazy telling myself there is no way this is really happening and that I am a fool for getting sucked in to the idiocracy. From a science fiction point of view it is almost as if I am molding into the new reality like a puzzle piece and the more I embrace it the more I feel foolish for believing it. My realistic point of view says that although the Mandela Effect may be a hoax it is far too much fun to just let the ideas slip away. Which brings me to my next point.. How much do people really know about our world? Honestly anything on the internet can be altered at any given time whether it be the spelling of certain products i.e. colegate  colgate froot loops  fruit loops or the way some continents and countries are starting to look on maps South America being more to the East instead of directly under Mexico and the USA or Austraila increasing in size. All of these things are just internet hyperbole. Sure if you go to the store you will see the spelling on these items is in fact Colgate and Froot Loops which doesnt PROVE anything. In my opinion a merging between alternate dimensions would change a lot more than just a few letters on a box of toothpaste or a cereal box. Where are the switched arms on limbs on humans or rearrangement of facial features. You honestly think quantum leaps through time and alternate dimensions would only limit us to these minor changes? Also whos to say that some companies are not intentionally changing the spelling of their productslogos for marketing purposes?. Why I want to believe in the Mandela Effect.Simply put when I heard about Muhammad Alis death via facebook I was wondering why so many people were posting pictures of him because in my reality I thought he had already died a long time ago. I cannot pinpoint when or if I really do remember it but I remember questioning why I am seeing so many posts about Ali today? What is going on here? Then I read a post which said something not what was actually posted but close enough like RIP ALI AKA THE GREATEST . Then I was like wtf I thought this guy has BEEN dead and for a while now. So I became dumbfounded.Now I want to reiterate my feelings where one moment I am totally believing everything the Mandela Effect is saying and then the next I am certain they are lies. It really does feel as if there are  separate realities that are simultaneous to each other at times. So much is flawed with the english language and our way of thinking that proving a theory to be true is practically a miracle. For example if enough people believe that the Mandela Effect is real then it is real to an extent but the skepticism of the masses seems to outweigh the force of validity to the beliefs of the minimum but if undeniable evidence which I have yet to witness were to sway the majority then it would be a true phenomenon. In its current arrangement the Mandela effect can be attributed to as nothing more than just a mind F or a trip. Here are two word spellings that bothered me today while writing this. I might just be an idiot or I might be correct to be fair I do not use word processing every day so it is likely that I am somewhat dimwitted and it has NOTHING to do with the Mandela Effect.Reiterate  Reinterate Each other  EachotherI have a youtube video that presents a theoretical claim of a man who owns a bible not trying to be a preacher here but give me a chance from the s and he claims to remember what specific scriptures said and explains how that certain words in them have now changed and when he compares it to a modern quick reference book for bible scriptures he discovers that the correct words of which should appear in the s bible are found in the quick reference one. Almost as if someone came and swapped the verses from the s bible and the modern quick reference book making it appear is if the older version of the King James bible was stupid or idiotic in its context compared to this other book. ,MandelaEffect,d44hs5e,1,t5_2zejk

7916836,0,t1_d45vgp3,gtNothing in the article explains why this second and presumably older and therefore original version doesnt actually look anywhere near as old and aged by time as the one in the Louvre ...Thats easy. The Louvre Mona Lisa uses lighter pigments in large areas and since da Vinci preferred oils those lighter pigments would be the first to degrade. Isleworth Mona Lisa has huge areas of complete darkness in the style of chiaroscuro. Black pigments are quite hardy and last much longer than lighter pigments. That and the fact that it was kept in a vault for decades.gtBottom line Im not convinced at all and heres another tale of yet another Mona Lisa to go right along with it and show just how muddied and muddled these waters actually are...Its clear youve never studied art history. I lived in Florence for a year doing art restoration and conservation so I am very well versed in the history of Florence. This is the city wherein da Vinci painted both portraits and there are numerous records of both existing during the th century. They were referred to as Monna Lisa and Gioconda in Giovanni Paolo Lomazzos On the Art of Painting Sculpture and Architecture. Why would a noted artist and theorist mention two portraits by da Vinci of similar subject if only one existed?The Isleworth Mona Lisa has been authenticated through countless tests and this was huge news in the art community. Perhaps thats why Im aware that there are two portraits and you are not. Doesnt explain why you refuse to believe the facts presented to you.,MandelaEffect,d45xe0h,3,t5_2zejk

Would anything convince you that you spelled a name wrong?Im not saying your memory is especially bad Im saying youre human.

8037579,0,t1_d4jcvoa,gt  We Are The Champions  ending no longer says Of the world with the musical statement afterward. I contacted a singer in a Queen cover band who confirmed the old ending.Yeah that clip is in the song. You just falsely assumed it was at the end when reviewing your vague and gapfilled memories because the vocals trail off and it was hard for you to remember the next part. Simplest explanation? You misremembered where a lyric occurs in a song. gtNonsense. Your friends are just deeply wrong about something they obssess over. Im sorry but it happens sometimes. Were human. Literally all the evidence says theyre wrong and the simplest explanation is a flaw in their thought process and memory not a shift in reality itself. Memories and thoughts about reality are not more reliable than reality itself. Have you considered the fact that Connally himself says your friends are wrong? Oh and his name is Connally not Connelly. No that doesnt mean youre a realityjumping cosmonaut. It means you spelled a name wrong.gt  Cruella DeVille noe De Vil  I have a family friend who not only works for Disney but is the head designer for all their parades. Whos your friend? I call bullshit on your claim about his position as well as the claim that the person with that position remembers the name that way and claims its due to your fantasy version of ME. Its just a misspelling and even being closely connected with something doesnt mean that one person out of thousands couldnt remember something wrong and then double down on that mistake.  Are you saying your friend is Steve Davison who is the Lead Creative Executive of Parades and Spectaculars? Or is this yet another example of reality suddenly jumping sideways when someone checks your claims and memory? Im currently betting hes just one person out of thousands upon thousands to be involved in Disney in some way and given that many people youre sure to find someone who holds all sort of mistaken beliefs. Because were human.gtI can list off over  more examples like thisAnd theyll all be easily explained by humans having fallible constantly revised memories and occasionally being irrational about how they deal with mismatches between what they think and the real world.gtIf you are a physicist I hope youll offer a valid response to this other than You cannot trust your own memory which is a COP OUT. What the hell do you even mean by cop out? Its just a simpler explanation. Its irrational to reject it and instead substitute a much more complicated and less wellsupported claim. This is basic rationality. gt I can say your responses are invalid because we cant trust that you have a solid memory of physics.My claims dont rest on trusting my memory over reality. Go check reality. Thats the heart of science  go check reality. Oh would you look at that! Reality strongly favors my explanation. Reality is the stuff that is independent of what you think about it.You keep trying to twist this into yeah well your memory sucks too or yeah well maybe my memory is better than yours.

We have had thousands of years of cutting people open and hundreds of years of professionalized surgeries and autopsies there is no reason why people wouldnt know that the heart was in the center there is no logic to this tradition.I remember studying the anatomical diagrams with the heart centered on the left side and the liver on the right like you remember studying different drawings of the ribs. As Harvard said symmetry is only skin deep. All these creatures have hearts on the left side. All of them have stomachs and spleens on the left and their livers on the right.

Meaning  they anticipated of the world not getting tagged on to the ending  but become confused when they do end up hearing it ? Im just trying to wrap my head around this . Is it the exact opposite in every way now  when compared to the small time you had experienced it the other way  both the  song and the car karaoke video ?For what its worth  the song always had of the world at the end for me .EDIT  Or  was the karaoke car vid the same in both realities ?

I agree the flipflops are the most fascinating I think it means we have not been plunked down from an alternate universe exactly if we had then the changes would not keep flipping back and forth so it must be something with time lines or group memory maybe.  For definately I do remember confusion with spell check on that one but I did not know about MEs back then so just assumed I had a bad memory.  I do remember it as definitely  years ago because I have a way of sounding it out that helped me remember and that way is now working with the current spelling so the current spelling fits with my long ago memory is all I know for sure.  ,MandelaEffect,d6r5ez3,1,t5_2zejk

8773680,0,t3_50a1t9,I can relate to this. For a period of time now Ive felt very much like the moods and behaviors of my close friends family and my partner have been erratic and unpredictable. But for most of  I have felt that the nice versions of these people are seldom present. Hearing that someone else has experienced this is comforting. I think maybe if there IS some sort of time slip or parallel universe or alternate dimension I think that perhaps we were phasing back and forth and in and out and because of that sometimes wed end up here together and then thered be a fluke where I ended up present here with the HERE version of my partner and then my partner would phase in. This has shown up for me as my partner claiming not to recall specific conversations the way he worded things remembering MY words differently than I knew I said them. It is very frustrating because when we do end up in the same space at the same time it feels very much like Ive found him again and we have wonderful conversations and it feels familiar and close and then... I dont know... maybe one of us leaves? I have also had the bad luck being unable to find employment having MAJOR health issues I keep checking to see if anything changes from my understanding about the pituitary because my just stopped working. No cause found. Literally months and months of testing and my diagnosis was Chronic Idiopathic Hypopituitarism. During that time I learned pretty much everything about the pituitary so if anything becomes obviously different it will stand out in a major way for me. I also dont feel like I really belong here at times. I have a feeling quite often now almost like I am remembering somewhere ELSE a place which feels nostalgic and like home. Now that I write this I have to admit... in my old reality I really did feel like race relations had improved. Ive never been someone who was blind to the realities of race but I feel like things just unraveled and suddenly its like a nightmare in terms of all of the hatred and violence and death here. I can remember feeling like each month each year seemed to be an improvement and then it was like something happened and society felt different. Then it was just division and anger and sad news. There are many people talking about some type of ascension concept but to me theres nothing here which feels elevated. It all feels heavier sadder darker. ,MandelaEffect,d72dkfa,9,t5_2zejk

OP said Sandy was a Category  hurricane when it made landfall in NJ when it really was a tropical storm when it hit. Do you think a Category  hurricane hitting the NY  NJ area really wouldnt have a major death toll? Additionally I realize the category numbers dont reflect size as they should or use another name for the metric I was being hyperbolic about the physical size to make a point. However they do reflect wind intensity and mph winds hitting the Jersey Shore Manhattan or anywhere in that general area would be even more catastrophic than the lower categories that hit that area due to the wind speeds property density and population density. The population of the Orlando area is roughly  million people the NY  NJ tristate area is over  million people. I stand by my numbers in that respect if you dont think that a mph hurricane hitting the NY  NJ area would kill more than  people I have no idea what would convince you otherwise.  ,MandelaEffect,d778kb9,1,t5_2zejk

Its like eons have passed as have I many times just to come back and carry on just like nothing ever happened. Theres this great feeling of amnesia the nostalgia as well. I remember a scene from my life like a Twilight Zone episode. Writhing in pain around  unable to get up unable to lay down an immense pain in my lower left side. I worked up the nerve to crawl out to my family so I could beg to be taken to a hospital. Nothing they didnt respond. They went about life as normal youll be okay so Honeys sister which movie were you going to see tonight? I pleaded for awhile but to no avail. If I had to describe what I witnessed and remember it was surreal. There was a blinding bright yellow light coming from the window everything felt slowed and skewed in time. minutes seemed like hours and my family felt like they werent really there. So I laid with this pain for days. It was the worst Id ever felt or feel I ever will. So two days later I woke up. To an attentive family to everything seemingly normal. The pain was no longer there almost as if it had never been. All seemed normal but it wasnt.From that day on nobody I knew was exactly the same. My father was no longer a quicktriggered guy who would yell or be physical any chance he got. My mother wasnt soft and sweet anymore but more gruff and sarcastic the list goes on.I honestly wonder that if while I was dying I experienced the transition between realities the bright light the skewed time the strange responses sort of a near death experience?

Im giving you the benefit of the doubt that you are just playing Devils advocate here and dont actually believe this. Even if you do thats fine. I only wanted to correct the misinformation that certain users are spreading here that ET says home phone instead of phone home. This isnt accurate and is instead incredibly misleading. The guy in your video link obviously and dishonestly chose to misrepresent the scene including cutting it off before E.T does actually say the line everyone remembers in the same scene. He instead says the famous line isnt in this scene which is just a blatant lie. There is no real discrepancy because both phrases obviously still exist.No one is arguing that this isnt an ME i.e. A fact that appears to have changed for a group of people. Its just that pretty obviously as shown in the full scene and in OPs post there are far more reasonable and likely explanations to explain this discrepancy than the scene ever physically changing.

So ever since I looked into this movie the line has been Houston we have a problem.So how are you saying that the line wasnt always Houston we have a problem in the movie and why is it that you think only you are experiencing these flipflops?Look to be clear in the real life Apollo  mission astronaut Jack Swigert said Houston weve had a problem. In the Apollo  movie Tom Hanks says Houston we have a problem and this change from the actual line which was said in real life was a decision by the director to make the problem in the movie sound more urgent. This is how it always was in the movie  and I dont want to add always was for me because this would just be perpetuating the issue.Somehow a bunch of you are getting very confused.

Were just trying to keep this theory as credible as a theory can be by actually looking at evidence and if its able to be disproved we disregard it. In the example that this effect is named for millions though that Nelson Mandela died while he was in jail but in reality he died much later. The reason why it started blowing up is because so many unconnected people remembered it wrong and they couldnt influence each other to remember it this way so the theory was born. This is really shitty paraphrasing.Your example is close to that but missing the key component of a huge amount of people misremembering it because the only people you named who also thought he died before were people close to you that could influence each others thinking. No one here is being hostile were trying to explain the above to you and explain how this isnt an example of the Mandela effect.

I really dont remember him being a comedian at all... but I never watch or pay attention to stand up comedy so that maybe why I didnt know that. I mean... if someone brings up George Carlin the first thing I think of is Dogma since I never saw any of his standup work. edit to say holy shit  I just googled Sinbad the Pirate after seeing someone else post about Sinbad the Sailor and wtf? Sinbad the Sailor  looks like similar quality film as I remember Sinbad the pirate to be but they swapped out Sinbad for a white dude? and I remember people on this sub talking about the Genie thing being people are probably misremembering as he was a pirate in all those moviesLike  months ago I was in a reality where we were talking about a Sinbad Genie movie but the whole chain of familyfriendly Bgrade direct to VHS Sinbad the Pirate movies from the s was never in contention.

10184441,0,t1_dby6246,They switched from manual equipment which required DJs to actually move around physical disks to purely digital systems where tracks and even commercial time could be scheduled well in advance on a playlist. There was some amount of error and inconsistencies in how well the radio DJs managed the switchovers and some songs cut off early or even were intentionally cut off early or with an intro section cut out so that only the exciting sections of a song would play listeners tune out or go to another station if you play the full intro or outro of some songs. Additionally after the digital switchover some record companies and radio stations made rules about how radio tracks would and could be played in their entirety but often radiospecific versions of tracks that cut out long solos intros and outro. From someone who remembers mix tapes where you had to manually record songs from the radio and how many early definitive versions of songs on NapsterKazaa had radio DJ intros into middle sections of songs this one doesnt surprise me at all especially if younger people arent familiar with how different the world of radio used to be from today.,MandelaEffect,dbygo2y,1,t5_2zejk

10240749,0,t3_590mh9,Again I posted this a while ago this is no ME. But it appears that some people really want this to be some paranormal thing. Let me clear this up. Until a while ago some time in the s there were multiple logo types in use depending on location of manufacture etc. Afaik in the European market the logos with the gap have always been used but there were some plants abroad that used a variant without the gap. No big deal seemingly. However VW only had the branding rights registered for the logo WITH the gap. To make things even more confusing this was not the original design. The designer of the logo an Austrian named Nikolai Borg created it without the gap. Here are some pics of the guy and the original gapless logo design This guy claimed that VW had altered his design to avoid paying him royalties for the logo design. The caveat is however that in some instances VW actually continued to use the gapless design. All this led to a lawsuit in which Nikolai Borg sued VW for not paying him royalties. Ultimately he lost but ever since VW is somewhat more cautious about using a consistent logo design in all places. There was an article from an Austrian newspaper on this lawsuit which I linked in another reddit post on this topic but I can neither find my post nor the article anymore...maybe this is the real ME about all this haha,MandelaEffect,dc4ugtq,3,t5_2zejk

If it was a logo I drew it if it wasnt easy to explain.  If it was a commercial I tried to remember a tag line oddly I found that I had a better success rate with products my parents never actually bought only things I was familiar with from commercials For me a handful particularly the Field of Dreams and Forest Gump ones were movies I only saw after they were on television. The first thing that was coming to my mind was actually something off an animated TV show.  The Field of Dreams one in particular a mashup from two separate lines in an episode of Tiny Toon Adventures.

Ill come to the hospice and do a bedside vigil with them until they pass.  One of our rooms is haunted. None of our patients are healthy enough to be walking the hall unattended. So one day Im at the nurses station chatting and I saw a man walk into the room at the end of the hall. I told the nurse someone was out of bed and I dashed down there to go assist the patient into bed. Theres nobody in the room. So I go back to the nurses station and theyre all laughing at me! I asked what the problem was and one of our nurses was like oh you finally saw the spook huh? Never seen him since but he likes to scare the new hiresnursing students. Its kind of like a right of passage for us. I do get a creepy feeling in that room though.  I had a patient who told me her husband was here to take her home that evening after her kids visited. Her husbands deceased. I assured her that she wasnt going to be able to go home today you dont go home from hospice  but she insisted that she was going to see her kids and then her husband would take her home. Okay whatever. The kids come they leave in the evening we make sure shes all settled after the visit and then we let her rest. She died that evening.  I was doing a bedside vigil and I stared feeling really sick. Like terrible stomach flu out of nowhere. I thought I was going to need to vomit my head was throbbing and I felt like I was having extreme difficulty breathing. My patient opened their eyes gave a faint smile closed their eyes and they were gone. My symptoms immediately disappeared. Now is that stuff paranormal? Maybe maybe not. No matter how long youre exposed to it I think death is always still a little creepy so its no wonder I feel nervous in rooms alone especially knowing how many dozens of people have taken their last breaths in there. Im personally a skeptical believer  I think most experiences can be explained. But Ive just never really come up with anything for our resident spook. Weve got too many people who experience the same thing without us telling them about him we dont want to scare anyone. I cant fathom a logical explanation for that one. ,MandelaEffect,dcgergd,1,t5_2zejk

Extremely vivid ones complete with sensations and complicated inter workings of how a hot air balloon works even though there was no way I knew that information when I was a child and being attached by pterosaurs on said hot air balloon yes.Memories no. I was born in .Edit WAIT.  Do you remember how planetariums in the s and s. would show movies that were meant to be immersive experiences where you could feel it?  That they mostly did away with once actual theme parks and IMAX theaters did it better? Where the screen was a sphere and you either sat around on the floor or in theater seating.  You were told to shut your eyes if the motion started to make you sick?There was one where you were in a runaway baby carriage one where you were on a roller coaster.And there was one in clip form only at the place I saw it where you are in a balloon and a hand glider.  I cant find the isolated clip but I did find a description of it but it looks like it was probably this  which came out in  and was apparently one of the most popular things at the time. Another friend pointed out the Cinerama series as well which is definitely the roller coaster I am remembering.  Someone in TOMT suggested Speed as well.It matches the timeline.  It would have been one of the very first things children from the late s and early s would have possibly seen where it was first person and covers their peripheral vision better than todays IMAX films it was intentionally created to make you feel like you were there AND it would have been in a place that you would typically go to on a class trip which would not necessarily involve your family.  I wonder if this is the cause of at least some of the hot air balloon memories!  Those people who only remember the balloon ride and not other details of it. See if you can find it and see if it matches up with your memories! Especially if any of your class trips involved going to the Smithsonian in DC.Because I absolutely remember a shortish clip of being in a hot air balloon in a theater like that where we sat on the floor of a small round brown building at Oglebay Park in Wheeling WV.

The physics you were taught in high school is based on simplifying assumptions that do not hold up in the real world. . There is growing evidence of extra dimensions. Many people claim that science does not support that theory. The key question is not whether parallel universes exist but how many levels there are. Max Tegmark  MIT Cosmologist.. Experimental evidence of reverse time physics is being demonstrated in the lab including retrocausal signals and phenomenon exist and are showing up in research labs around the world Based on rapidly improving quantum technologies and nonlinear optics we are on the threshold of a massive discoveries about the fundamental nature of time itself..

10767143,0,t3_5tv3oq,I was somewhat familiar with Rugrats growing up due to the fact I would likely accompany my mother during the run she babysat for a bigger family as one example. She definitely remembers it especially since we saw the movie when it was in theaters and it was a Nick cartoon all the way. But when it came to my home life as an only child we didnt have cable so PBS was my only cartoon source so of course something I grew up on was Arthur. I am focusing on Arthur in specific because there is an episode I believe was titled The Secret Lives of Dogs and Babiesit was the episode which started what would be the occasional trend of how babies and pets can understand and communicate with each other. The way the episode began was that Arthur and DW are watching a parody of Rugrats which soon brings us to the fact Pal and Kate were in the room and Kate makes a comment along the lines of how the show was unrealistically portraying babies and so she and the dog turn on a Teletubbies parody when no one is looking.

Now before you go all Dave I want to make clear that NO this is not proof of anything and YES its possible we are mistaken. However these are thoughts we wouldnt have otherwise. I think these are interesting because its not like most where we see something but never think anything of it. In these cases we were observing closely and analyzing afterwards.

It wasnt until I was about  that people started talking about the did Phil see someone drown or Phil totally saw someone drown and didnt help. At no time before that did anyone I know interpret it as he saw someone drown before that even via weird kid logic. Even me the person who jumped to the weirdest and most puzzling kid logic of anyone in my family. It is really one of the biggest pop culture puzzles of my childhood.I always understood the song to be about Phil just hating someone so much that if they were drowning he would stand back and let them. The entire song is just one huge edge of hate ready to snap on the person if he encountered them tonight.When I was a kid I did think it was about Peter Gabriel though after my parents told me he used to be in Genesis.,MandelaEffect,dfk792h,1,t5_2zejk

Personally I hear Gandalf say Follow but that could very well be my schizophrenia working on overdrive which is another way of saying that the delivery is sufficiently ambiguous to mean that people hear it as whatever they expect to hear it as until they listen more closely therein precipitating the tinge of the surreal along the nape of their neck if they should so hear it as something other than the expected run you fools.

I am your father makes far more dramatic sense.  the line right before is Luke his hand cut off screaming He told me enough!  He told me you killed my father!!.  I used to know the scene almost by heart so I was always attuned to its dramatic rhythms.  But then when people think of the line they naturally think it would be Luke I am your father because they arent remembering its place in the scene just its iconic impact.If someone had a memory of the scene in which more than that line was altered I would be more impressed.Secondly Luke and No are only one word off.  Thirdly James Earl Jones as a voice actor never memorized lines so it isnt surprising that he would get one word wrong.  I remember reading an interview with him where he talks about the fact that he doesnt know the movies all that well for that reason.,MandelaEffect,dg1e9aj,3,t5_2zejk

This one is a certainty for me after a period late last year where a central train station in my city was covered in advertising for the betting company Ladbrokers. It spanned at least a couple of weeks to a month but strangely I can only find proof of it occurring in  not .

In your reality do you remember both his fists being clenched?  Whatever the original quote was clearly intended to describe both of his hands to some degree.  Calling his hands open is being very disingenuous.gtOh and pretend while youre at it that you are actually thinking logically its always so damn adorable!You have no right to be condescending when you find intersecting realities to be a more likely explanation than a misquote or mistranslation.Make no mistake believing that you are critically thinking is not the same as actually critically thinking.,MandelaEffect,dgchhon,5,t5_2zejk

11672091,0,t1_dgj12sd,Why not Goerge Lucas was going for a lived inused universe. A droids coverings are like a cars coverings. Have you seen old cars that have a piece that look like it just had primer on it or was a different color? By your logoc that makes no sense.However the owner of the car mat jave needed to get that piece replaced due to damage and found one at a place and used that. Didnt have time or money to get it painted but it covers the spot it needs to.A droid in Star Wars is the same way. Plating on the leg gets damaged grab plating off another unused droid of the same model and call it good.Also as for the excuses you seem to be someone that understands veru little of these processes and since I just called you out on all of your BS you are now resorting to just huffing and puffing. You have no leg to stand on with this and you know it. Look at the comments not everyone remembers an all gold P in the origonal trilogy as he was not all gold. There were tons of promotional material produced with P being all gold but this was how it was licensed for promotion. Also just because you remember him being all gold does not make him all gold. It just means that your mind has created that memory based on the amount of promotional material of him that way paired witb the fact that the majority of the time many of us watched the films was ona  or full framepan and scan format which cuts off about  on each side. This changed with in the last  years when widescreen became the standard and people were now able to see more of the screen thus revealing... wait for it...
