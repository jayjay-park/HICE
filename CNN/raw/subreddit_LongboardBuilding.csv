833798,0,t1_cgyz2no,My press is really simple.  The bottom half is just two xs that run parralel about  apart and are connected on the bottom with a couple cross pieces that extend a bit out from the press to clear the board while pressing  The top half is just a single x that presses down on the centerline of the board and has cross pieces that line up with the bottom half.  This way I just use  very big clamps that I have to press a board with just a simple concave throughout its whole length.  I use layers of  BB for my boards so they are stiff enough so that my press applies enough force to evenly glue the board or so I hope!,LongboardBuilding,cgz1ztj,2,t5_2t30z

6677703,0,t3_472hpc,My first board was a vertical lamination board perfectly flat out of maple and walnut with a salt shaker of aluminum oxide grip in the top coat of finish.  Ive build other more capable boards since then but I always go back to that one for cruising.  The real question is What kind of tools do you have?  If you have a table saw a jointer and a thickness planer you should make a vlam board.  If you dont have those you should make a pressed Baltic birch board out of  baltic birch plywood.  I make boards with my high school wood shop students. ,LongboardBuilding,d0a16uf,1,t5_2t30z
