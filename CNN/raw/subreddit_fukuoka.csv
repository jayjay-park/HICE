427926,0,t1_cfp34hd,ah Ive Googled it but I was thinking of switching to Kyudai Hospital in HigashiKu because it closer to where we live and I thought that hey its an university hospital might be easier to find someone who could at least understand English.We are currently seeing an obgyn in Tenjin area and he gave us an optionrecommendation to switch into a bigger hospital because they have a pregnancy class or something like that.,fukuoka,cfp4bn4,1,t5_2s8hw
1646184,0,t3_2d65z3,I was at the Ohashi branch for  years and Ive had a bunch of friends who worked at Tenjin branch at various times. Theyre extremely busy and have pretty high turnaround on management and teaching staff even for Aeon.  Expect to teach a minimum of  classes per week sometimes even more than that. Also youd be right near honbu which means youd get lots of visits from upper management. Tenjin and Hakata schools also make up a huge proportion of the sales during selfstudy so youll be expected to sell a lot.Not saying you shouldnt take the position but its definitely one of the tougher schools to be placed in.,fukuoka,cjmnydh,2,t5_2s8hw
5550225,0,t3_3pbl80,I wear cm and Ive never found any place in Fukuoka to go shoe shopping. Maybe one store out of  will have a single style of shoe in  and the style probably sucks. I just gave up and do my shoe shopping when Im abroad.Theres an outlet in Tosu that I went to years ago bought some cm classic Vans. Tosus not terribly far from Fukuoka.In general though I think hes out of luck. There are some specialty shops in Tokyo that carry bigger sizes but I dont know of anything in Fukuoka like that. If he finds something please let me know!,fukuoka,cwl2221,2,t5_2s8hw
