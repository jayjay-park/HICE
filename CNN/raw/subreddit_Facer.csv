1907613,0,t1_ckj08ta,Thanks! I had the font larger initially but then double digit hours resulted in clipping with the hourminute hands. Feel free to edit the font size as you like in Facer!,Facer,ckj205d,1,t5_32hhv

1930763,0,t1_ckkzo2l,Tried these on Moto Amber red and blue but it looks like you scaled the face too small.  Easy check  Download zip and view the preview.png file in the zip and youll see exactly how it appears on the Moto  that is its scaled a little too small...  Maybe these werent meant for Moto?,Facer,ckluckt,1,t5_32hhv

2056762,0,t3_2ib6en,No the best way to do it is to take the image of the watchhand and make a seperate image of it completely black. Set it one layer behind the hand you want to shadow and give it the same rotation and offset it a couple pixels from where the other have is located then turn the opacity down until it looks good.,Facer,cl19cul,1,t5_32hhv

2155211,0,t1_cldo9ul,Yes enabled it in settings and using dwfss tag.  I think its just the fps I notice as far as stutter is concerned.  Its pretty smooth but sometimes also just gets stuck for half a second or so so I thought it may be performance related.  ,Facer,cldryfg,1,t5_32hhv

2293458,0,t1_clv45bx,Oh oops!  I dont really need to monitor my battery and the placement is a little confusing.  Other than that I really like it. I also like how it doesnt have a standbyboring mode.  Since Im using an LG G watch it shouldnt really use any extra battery life since its a plain old LCD screen.,Facer,clv6rpe,1,t5_32hhv

2547562,0,t3_2ow747,This was a limitation of Android Wear prior to the . update. Face was using unofficial APIs to work as a watch face and it didnt allow for the less intrusive notifications. Once you get the Android Wear . update you will be able to go back to the smalleropaque notification cards.,Facer,cmr3q7l,3,t5_32hhv

2852284,0,t1_cns63ga,Yeah I use to have a couple of faces on Facer but I checked today and they were all missing. I assume they were all taken down for copyright as I had heard of that happening with some other faces. Its a damn shame I bet a lot of nice faces were removed. ,Facer,cnsazqi,1,t5_32hhv
2855351,0,t1_cjzw7p0,Hey this is happening to me on my HTC One M with my Moto . I replaced the picture of the Notorious B.I.C. watchface here  with this  I uploaded it to my watch and now Facer wont stop crashing on my watch. I even tried uninstalling Facer Resyncing apps to my watch installing Facer again then again Resyncing apps and Facer still crashes everytime I try to launch it. Any idea why this might be or how I may solve it?,Facer,cnsnjv1,1,t5_32hhv

2973026,0,t1_co5zjkg,Appreciate all that information. It was my first time making a watch face and going to take your advice and try to have another go at it. I actually just noticed the picture looks way different than it does on my watch too. It moved a lot of stuff out of position and changed some of the opacity. Thanks again! ,Facer,co61r93,3,t5_32hhv

8501065,0,t3_4vtjax,Ive not found a way to do this either but you can duplicate the element and then either set a separate condition in the transparency to make it invisible if you want a different one displayed or on the xy position to push it off the display area.,Facer,d646p8l,2,t5_32hhv
