185541,0,t3_1w833b,If you love pasta there is a lot of stuff you can do with just pasta eggs and whatever you have on hand.Cook the pasta and let it cool. As a matter of fact  day old pasta works best for some reason.If its spaghetti cut into  inch long pieces. Sorry Germany.  Zentimeter. Grease a pan with butter throw in spaghetti and fry for a bit. Now add your other ingredients. Maybe some leftover ham diced up some peas maybe broccoli really there is nothing you cant add. Fry long enough until its done.Take some eggs how many depends on how much speghetti you have.. at least  eggs whisk them add a little bit of water before you whisk then add them to the mix and keep turning the noodles. You want the eggs to coat the noodles and ingredients not form a blob of cooked egg.Tadaa! Very cheap can be healthy and its yummy.,Cheap_Meals,cezkkaq,3,t5_2r7s6

3799212,0,t1_cqp47gw,My recommendation is to learn basic baking. lbs of bread flour costs  at my local grocery store you can get it cheaper in bulk and has  calories the only other place youll beat that costcalorie ratio is with vegetable oil.Look into making your own pizza dough. You can make homemade mozzarella for cheap with whole milk not ultrapasteurized rennet dirt cheap dont use Junket Rennet and citric acid dirt cheap.I make my own pizza regularly. I also make my own hamburger buns sourdough boules pasta calzones hotpockets naan bread extremely easy biscuits flatbreads bagels require barley malt syrup etc...Dough is also very freezer hardy.Learning to bake is the biggest money saver you can bring to your cooking experience. Its not worth being intimidated by its a bit messy the first few times you bake something protip mix the flour and water with a long wooden spoon not your hand  of the mess is avoided but other than that follow the directions precisely and whatever youre making WILL be tasty. Baking is a science.edit Also if youre going to be eating a very simple diet I recommend taking a multivitamin. Vitamins get a bad rap from a lot of people who dont know what theyre talking about. There is an organization called the USP that is comprised of scientists who verify the nutrition content of various vitamins and supplements. Their seal of approval is coveted and separates the wheat from the chaff.This is . years worth of daily USPapproved multivitamins for .Information on the USP Directory of USPapproved supplements Job description of an actual open position with the USP right now Scientist IIIII gt This is a handson nonsupervisory position in USPs RampD Separation Laboratory. In this role the Scientist III works on technical problems in analytical chemistry that directly support revisions to the USPNF. These include development or validation of analytical procedures supporting the identity of the drug or drug product.As you can see the USP is an nonprofit organization of scientists lab techs business and market analysts etc... who are dedicated to ensuring supplement purity.
