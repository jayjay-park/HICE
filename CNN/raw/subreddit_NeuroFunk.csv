4220975,0,t1_cs1594r,Apparently Billain is working on his debut album not sure if itll be out this year but he is releasing an EP this year as well.I believe his album will be a cornerstone in not just neurofunk but all of drum and bass. ,NeuroFunk,cs1df09,3,t5_2s1gn

7548674,0,t3_4iqdv7,I would say NeuroFunk is more constructed like liquid jazzfunk baseline structures where as techstep is more structured like techno. NeuroFunk  Calyx and TeebeeTechstep  Black Sun Empire. But yeah so many artists make stuff thats all over the place so its generally hard to pigeonhole anyone,NeuroFunk,d308xov,2,t5_2s1gn

7947256,0,t1_d49ccen,Actually going to see Sam Binga tonight so maybe Ill change my mind about this new genre of whatever it is but Im still interested to hear what people think about it  IMO it shouldnt be called drum and bass though sounds like a completely new genre of sound aside from the familiar dnb bpm.,NeuroFunk,d49ch8n,1,t5_2s1gn
