38309,0,t3_1uipkk,I took a year off under mental health leave.  Dont discount the minutiae your student loans may come out of deferment youll be offset from your friends but youll make friends too etc.  But its worth it.I was required to prove I was making progress toward improving the situation that caused me to leave Columbia.  For me this was therapy.  Voluntary leave may not require this but might come with other stipulations Im sure your adviser will know more about.I left the city for a year which I felt was important.  I thought it was important to get out and make new friends in a new place get a fresh look rather than staying around the city where I would constantly be reminded of my failings.  I would at the very least expand your apartment search to include the outer boroughs both to save money and to have a new living experience.,columbia,ceisjf3,2,t5_2qq0v

I can recommend particularly good instructorscourses if you tell me what you are interested in. The professors in the department are generally pleasant and helpful although sometimes busy.It also may be worth pursuing an independent research project i.e. you research and write for a professor instead of one course. I havent graduated yet but there seems to be a lot of opportunities especially if you make yourself known to the faculty.,columbia,cgsef3y,3,t5_2qq0v

3966857,0,t1_cr84to8,PTSD isnt distracting as shit its a mental health condition that needs treatment.  These studentsand you for that matterare missing the point of the core curriculum.  As said earlier its foundational literature that for better or worse shaped the world we live in.  The core ties you to the last  classes at Columbia and demands dissection of the works from an ever changing viewpoint of the modern student.  Thats the point.  If youre offended by the callous or commonplace acceptance of sexual assault in the works then discuss it.  We did.  Thats the point.  Dont demand the professor bend the material to your sensitivities and warn you of things that may offend you.  The world will offend you.  Be prepared for it.Again PTSD is serious and requires treatment.  Ive witnessed panic attacks but not one where the victim could sit through a small group discussion unnoticed.  I suspect what we have here are a few students more interested in drawing attention to themselves than purposefully seeking assistance and understanding from their professor.,columbia,cr8gew4,7,t5_2qq0v

7739663,0,t1_d3lvshc,I think the general consensus is that its more theorybaseda good number of the core classes for the major are strongly theorybased at least. I cant speak to all of the individual tracks.The culture is pretty laidback in my experience. Lots of students studying together and collaborating instead of competing. Most of the students I know are looking for practical skills to work in software dev after graduation though some are looking toward grad school and want a more theoretical foundation.FYI this page shows the requirements for the major and gives the class options for each track. It should give you a good sense of the structure of the program. Clicking on any of the classes will usually give you a description if you have any other questions about specific classes or the core of the major Ive taken all of the core classes plus Natural Language Processing and one of the little onecredit get yourself fluent in Python classes.,columbia,d3lxz9n,4,t5_2qq0v

9791073,0,t1_dajy21o,I think you and many of the people youre citing are conflating the terms. Yourtheir argument is that racism is exclusively white supremacy and Ive attempted to refute that argument by citing the most widely used English dictionary. White supremacy is a subset of racism. In the United States Ill agree and share your concern with the fact that a vast majority of racism is white supremacy but needlessly changing the definition of the word racism damages our ability to coherently discuss the problems at hand.The best way to discuss these issues is to speakwrite coherently so we should focus more on tackling white supremacy than on arguing with people about the definition of racism. Im on your side in this fight I really am I just want to make sure that were arguing in a way that people can understand. Thats why using the dictionary is important we can almost all agree on the definitions used in them.,columbia,dajyo4g,1,t5_2qq0v
