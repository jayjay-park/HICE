Saying Its great but I want to keep it secret is a sure way of being ignored.Which brings me to my last point. You still need to find accredited investors or risk running afoul of the SEC.

1688253,0,t1_cjrxa90,Oh! Converse thats pretty much where I grew up. Regarding water restrictions there are stages currently I believe we are in stage  which restricts how often you can water your lawn and some other minor things. Dont worry about the drought not allowing you to take a shower and stuff it usually just effects unnecessary things like watering your lawn filling your pool washing your car ect. While working at a gas station in converse I once asked a cop what the biggest crime problems are and he told me petty theft and domestic violence he said he typically would make multiple trips to Walmart every day to arrest some kid for shop lifting. There is a restaurant in converse near Judson high school and FM called sobrositos that is a local legend. Pretty good Mexican food.  Another tip when looking for good Mexican food is to listen to the staff if it appears that the waitresses speak poor English and all of the rest of the staff communicates with each other in Spanish you might have found a good restaurant. If youre concerned about speaking Spanish dont be. The only Spanish you need to learn is food so that you know what youre ordering at a restaurant. Pat booker rd is loaded with awesome restaurants too and there is a pet shop towards the end of pat booker towards randolph AFB not i called pollys pet shop that is pretty dang awesome. I cant explain it youll just have to visit it. A little ways up loop  where it intersects i you will find the forum shopping center that has best buy target kohls old navy ect. Speaking of shopping you will quickly learn the joy of H.E.B grocery and lucky for you the H.E.B on Kitty hawk road has just been renovated and expanded. Seriously H.E.B  is the shit. The nearest mall is a ways up loop  its called rolling oaks and kinda sucks. North Star mall off of loop  is gigantic and the only real mall in San Antonio.

2029461,0,t1_ckxodhk,We have a Culinary Institute of America branch here  its actually byin the Pearl. Right now the whole area around The Pearl is probably where youll find the most progressive restaurants note to other SAers not saying these are the best just the most progressive. Purely vegetarian restaurants are very hard to find but most locations have an option. Some might be as limited as a house salad but other places might have things like vegetarian burgers  Green at the Pearl is one I hear get mentioned pretty frequently. We do have a handful of Indian restaurants as well.If you like to cook at home we have both Central Market and Whole Foods stores which have really great organic andor local options.  Theres also Sprouts but Ive personally found them to be hit or miss.  We have quite a few Farmers Markets popping up on the weekend the Pearl and the Alamo Quarry being the two biggest I know of. If youre a pescetarian Groomers Seafood is pretty good about selection but most of your other grocery stores will only have the default catfish salmon snapper tilapia shrimp type options. We are serious about foods that are bad for you here. Tons of donuts cupcakes and other bakerytype locals. The glutenfree fad has not hit here or if it has its very quiet. If youre coming here directly from NZ youll probably find the general culture map to be very similar. Since I believe that only the biggest shows have the budget to get out to NZ youll find it to be much like San Antonio. IMO we dont have any scenery that matches what youll find in New Zealand but youll probably be surprised at how spread out everything is. No ocean here just land. So much land...Having said all this I really like the city. If you want to get out to a more busy location Austins just an hours drive north Houston a couple hours south and Dallas three hours north. Ive visited my folks back in Dallas and friends in Austin and every single time I get flummoxed by the sheer mass of people. Im pretty sure Id break out in a rash of hitting people in the face if I went back to New York City right now although Im considering visiting relatives in Tokyo soon. The people here are still relatively small town nice  like most cities we have our jerks but most people are still on the friendly side. Driving is...interesting... but a small irritant compared to the benefits. The superyoung hypernightlife hipster or rave crowds probably wont find much to do here other than drink themselves silly which they do. We do tend to cater to a slightly slightly more laid back attitude. Oh I should mention that when spring hits we have trees that do this Youll most likely be allergic to it.,sanantonio,ckxse9m,3,t5_2qqch

To quote Hugh Miller the citys chief technology officer  it requires no additional personnel no additional equipment. We already spent the money it is already there lets turn it on. My staff has already spoken with former Councilwoman Letty Ozuna and she says we are ready and we have the physical aspects in place. According to Letty unfortunately San Antonio receives less than Floresville  we have no initiatives in place for us to reach out for the grants provided by the Federal government. These grants would help get diminish the great digital divide.Letty also told my staff that we do not have any current City Council member moving this initiative forward.I completely agree with Letty and would work hard to get these grants pushed. I would be the voice on City Council for SAABN. It is imperative we move forward on this for District  because our schools and our libraries will benefit the most from this technology.

4472087,0,t1_csuclx6,Im sorry to hear about your father but thats no excuse for your behavior. I would recommend you take some time away from Reddit until you are at a less stressful point in your life. You are obviously letting your personal stress get to you and it is making you see monsters where there arent any.    Perhaps when you are at a point where you dont feel the need to attack others out of frustration then you will be able to return to Reddit without needing to immediately seek out enemies. Stress can be a huge burden so I have a better understanding of why you are acting like this but lashing out at me isnt going to solve anything.

Also the choice has always been there and the reality is that people do not choose to do that. The fact that there are poor people who are hungry is proof that people will not simply choose to support the most vulnerable in our society. If people would make that choice then we would see them making that choice since at no point have we stopped them from making that choice. gtI dont think creating policies that force people to pay for things like overpriced college education is reasonable.Nobody is talking about force here. gtAnd yes I could leave the US if I wanted to but I like this country I was born here and I can vote. Thats what we are discussing. I love the convo dont ask me to leave because we dont agree.Im not asking you to leave. Im pointing out that you have a choice and because you have that choice you cannot refer to the consequences of that choice as being forced upon you. If you choose to park in a  a day parking lot you cannot then claim you were forced to pay . I dont want to force anybody to do anything either. We are all here by choice we all choose to be part of this society if this society decides education up through a bachelors degree should be free then that is our choice and anybody who doesnt want to pay for it is free to go. This is coming from a person with no kids and no plans for kids. Im happy to pay for education because I know that its better for me and all of us in the long run. ,sanantonio,cymwxec,0,t5_2qqch

7561722,0,t3_4iw2pv,Keep in mind that Alamo Heights and Castle Hills are cities politically separate from the City of San Antonio even though they are landlocked inside of San Antonio. They have different mayors councils and police forces. The police in those small cities have a higher likelihood of ticketing for going even one mile over the  mph speed limit. Im not exaggerating. To find a house youll have to use a realtor or agent to help you look for available rental listings. It varies around town. I would suggest looking for rental homes around the Midtown Broadway areas if you want proximity to downtown and the city center. If youre more homebody or suburban types almost any area between Loop  and Loop  on the northside would be great. Just beware of the other small cities too. I.e. Selma Schertz Leon Valley Universal City Hollywood Park Terrell Hills. There are  independent cities in Bexar County plus the unincorporated areas.

8725965,0,t1_d6wc3oc,Moving to Atlanta. Finding a place to live tops the list. Theres a bit of a housing shortage in Atlanta in certain areas. Other areas you can find homes for K but not sure you want to live there. Finding homes for rent was tough because people there dont use property managers or any of the real estate websites. Ive heard stories of people who put for rent signs in their front yard had people come on the first day amp agree to move there then reneg if they had any more immediate interest  trying to start bidding wars after already agreeing to a tenant. We used a company called Invitation Homes  they bought up a lot of houses on the cheap when the real estate market crashed and theyre a pretty good landlord. . Knowing which areas to live in that were conducive to areas to work in. We lived in Marietta I worked in Sandy Springs my wife worked in Smyrna. Traffic to Smyrna was bad but along back roads at the right time it wasnt horrible. Traffic to Sandy Springs was ridiculous   mile drive that took no less than  minutes usually an hour coming home if I left early . hours if I left real late or over  hours during rush hour p til p. For example you like the area around Buford Highway but around that area is hit or miss for living if you end up in Dekalb County you may regret it. Planning for traffic is extremely difficult because the towns infrastructure is almost  years behind their population growth.. Schools. They threw my kid in English for Speakers of Other Languages ESOL instead of normal English class because hes halfasian. He only speaks English. I tried to pull him out but they wanted him to test out a test that the other kids never had to take. I complained about it online and within  days Child Protective Services was knocking on my door about accusations of abuse made by a school counselor. Then I found out that the school gets extra funding from the State for each kid in ESOL plus those kids dont count towards their standardized test scores and rankings so they dont have to focus on those kids when training for the test. I launched a formal complaint with the statewide head of ESOL and with the school district got an initial response with no followup. The whole things a boondoggle. So yeah be careful of institutional racism. Just because a schools ranked high is no guarantee your kids going to get a good education there..Moving to San Antonio leaving Atlanta. Worst movers Ive ever hired were the ones based in Atlanta when we were leaving. They broke a bunch of my stuff and couldnt figure out how to fit my lawnmower in the truck so I had to give it away . They wrapped up every random piece of wood with my moving blankets but didnt bother to cover the fridge washer the dryer or the grill  all of which now look like theyve been through battle. . Customer service in general. Garbage men wanted their can back but were no shows multiple times to pick it up. Rented a dumpster for throwing away items that movers couldnt fit the people were so late picking up the dumpster that I had to get an extension on my lease  day extension   and then they tacked on shady charges after I gave them a bad ratingreview on their customer feedback a month later. The movers left a ramp amp a bullwork in my yard for days after they picked up the moving truck even after repeated calls to have them pick it up were met with assurances that they would be right over. Everyone says people in that area are laid back but laid back in the sense that theyll do the work youre paying them to do when they feel like doing it. ,sanantonio,d6wdz3i,2,t5_2qqch

Be competitive pay attention to quality in terms of your work and learning. What matters is what your boss and your boss boss thinks of you to hell with your peers. All too many younger people think playing the popular likable game is the way to go. Not the way so long as there are Boomers and GenX in upper management positions. As Ive counseled help desk candidates in the past youre only as good as your last trouble ticket and your performance stats matter. Oh and one other very important thing.....there are a ton of lazy people in San Antonio...the best way to stand out in the Help Desk field is to be a top producer in terms of ticket volume st in First Call Resolution total tickets tickets per hour whatever the metric your prospective employer measures by. A little ambition and drive can allow you to blow by the lazy locals and their halfassed work ethic.Good luck to you! ,sanantonio,d8soceh,0,t5_2qqch

10891318,0,t3_5vlikj,If it has been going on for a year the attacker is probably in most of your devices including your router. A factory reset on all devices might do the truck but if the attacker was good enough he could have already installed a root kit on your machine and have his malware unaffected by system restoring. This is highly advanced but possible. I would advise on purchasing a new router setting up WPA with at LEAST a  character password with upper lower special numbers mixed. No dictionary words. No special datesnames. Use only .Ghz it has a smaller range and will help you spot kids trying to crack your network  check outside for vans parked near you or kids with laptops outside.Before connecting said router backup only VITAL files as cloning the HDD or copying everything will likely result in transferring the malware. Generally pictures and files you created should be fine but downloads are a no go. Factory resetreinstall the OS on ALL systems and reformat any other disk drives prior to connecting to the Internet. Once complete connect one computer at a time on the network and immediately download and install Avast Free Antivirus and do a FULL system scan might take a bit. Do this for every computer. I would also download Avast for all phones and do full system scans and leave most services of Avast on.All devices should be clean at this point unless the attacker was more advanced unlikely. Now its a matter of protecting your online accounts. Log yourself out of any instances of your email account and reset your password. If possible enable two factor security with your phone if the site allows  Gmail allows this. Remember to keep your passwords complex and write them down do not store them on the computer. Repeat this process with ANY and EVERY online account that is linked with your credit cards including your financial institution. I would use a different password than your router.Cancel your credit cards and reorder new ones.I would also look into purchasing some identity protection services.Remember to check all devices that are connected to your network.It wont help much but if possible you can set up MAC filtering and SSID hiding on your router. If not change the SSID to something not associated with your or the routers modelbrand.Perform full system scans periodically.If your financial info hasnt been stolen and all he did was change your SSID then youre probably facing a teenage script kiddie the smiley face makes sense who is doing this for fun and may live near you.Hope this helps you feel safer.

For instance Texas shaped tortilla chips some of their specialty salsas their San Antonio Blend Coffee  San Antonio Street nuts  HEB coffee flavored candy and chocolate covered nuts. People will appreciate food gifts more than a product that just has the name of San Antonio on it.,sanantonio,demb1ea,3,t5_2qqch

11255274,0,t1_df7rbuq,You are right about that. There are lots and lots of problems with these schools. I would like to see a thorough analysis of it. I had a friend who worked in sales at Career Point. Although there were lots of regulations they worked around them. If you called and were interested in being a truck driver or in building your academic credentials to get in the military you would be talked into one of the programs at Career Point. The medical assistant program I understand is somewhat problematic because there are very few actual jobs in the medical assistant field as opposed to actual nursing or even CNA. Then theres the problem of the loans never being repaid and sticking the taxpayer with overpriced education. That problem was covered by the Express News pretty thoroughly.One thing Career Point did do very well I think was to try to convey the culture of work in an office to people who had generally worked very hard but mainly in fast food where respect for ones bosses and the need to maintain longterm relationships with the company was not part of the culture.,sanantonio,df7ro5p,1,t5_2qqch

11433121,1,t1_dfrwwni,Their reason is probably that they dont want anyone else parking next to them and dinging their doors. If theyre willing to park way out in the empty spaces to do that its not a big deal. I doubt anyone would park next to them if they just parked in the lines out there but at the end of the day nobody is hurt by it. Kinda funny that OP went to the trouble to take the picture and post online over something that did not impact them at all. Probably hoped to get some karma out of it because reddit especially rpics likes to circle jerk about people who dont park in the lines. ,sanantonio,dfrxl11,-1,t5_2qqch
