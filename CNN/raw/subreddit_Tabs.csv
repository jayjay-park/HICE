11263603,0,t3_60mnjt,Just copy this guy To check the tuning Drop D I wrote this on guitar pro.. gives you pretty much all the chords used and the notes of the intro lead If there are any minor differences he plays fret  at one point for example just copy what he does on the vid. You said yourself its very simple ,Tabs,df8pofw,1,t5_2qoxo
