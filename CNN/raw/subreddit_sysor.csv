1663336,0,t1_cjnrle5,Thanks so much for your help. I found a couple cool VRP for Min toll booth problems but I think Im going to give this paper a go if my Professor oks it.  Ive contacted one of the authors who was really helpful and I think they are willing to share the synthetic data they used which will be great.From a cursory look it doesnt look too intimidating and it mentions some areas for possible improvement which Id love to look at if I get time.,sysor,cjotq9l,1,t5_2qhm0
