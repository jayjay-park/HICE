I just think of the plays where Foles was waiting for something to develop because Jackson was double teamed Riley was too slow to get open and Ertz was barely in the game.  Imagine Maclin in the slot cooper and Djack out wide two TE set with Jimmy and Zach and Shady in the backfield.  How in gods name do you have enough defenders to stop all that.  Honestly the biggest problem Id see is if Foles can make the decision of which open guy to throw the ball too.  Everyone gets better.  Way way better after this move.

Inwardly I was less confident. Dogfighting is and has always been sickening. So when I saw Michael Vick volunteering and helping the cynical part of my mind kept saying Hes just doing the motions. It was easier to say once a scumbag always a scumbag.Then he kept helping. He kept moving forward. He kept his humility never once saying that he did not do a bad thing. At the same time he also held his head up knowing that he could take pride in what he was doing. Eventually the cynical part of my mind in regards to Michael Vick grew quieter and quieter. I thought what I had said months ago. Michael Vick proved my words right and my thoughts wrong. Hes done right. The Eagles and Philly were made better by his presence and so was anyone who followed his story.,eagles,cg9g6o0,1,t5_2qi5w

Carter later admitted that Ryan released him because of alcohol and drug abuse including large amounts of ecstasy cocaine and marijuana and credits his former coach with helping him turn his life around as a result.The hard part about this is that one of the intended consequences of this is for DeSean to better himself the way Cris Carter did. The goal here isnt to be right or wrong and Ill take no pride in giving you an I told you so if something bad happens. If everyone thinks the Eagles are fools for letting go of DeSean in five years but this ended up preventing him from getting himself killed or who knows what thats still okay.Occasionally our excitement about a sport leads us to forget that its just a game and it really doesnt matter at all. I want the Eagles to do well but not more than I want DeSean Jackson to be a good person in the world. Weve got too much death and pain in the world.

671254,0,t1_cggh2fn, Location. Oregon is a veritable desert of recruiting. Produces maybe  D recruits per year of whom only  will be ranked above . The weather hurts too.  Tradition. A lot of players have cited tradition and history as being important factors in their choice. Style. If youre a prostyle or pocket QB Oregon is not for you. Sure you might get an offer but youll have a much better time at USC Alabama etc that run a prostyle offense specifically. Lack of much to do. Eugene is a quiet town. There are a couple bars but thats pretty much it. The weather prevents a lot of outdoors activities that explode during the summer as a result. But other than that youre gonna spend a lot of time indoors. Some people like that some people want to live in LA or other more urban environments. Academics. Oregon is not Stanford Northwestern Vanderbilt etc. While we have some programs that are goodPT sports marketing etc most are pretty middling in comparison to even just other state schools like OSU. If a player wants a useful degree cause they cant break it in the NFL there are better options frankly.  The stigma of being a system player. Coming out of Oregon youll have a lot of stereotypes running against you especially if youre an offensive player. Youll have to work twice as hard to get that draft pick if youre an Oregon RB compared to an Alabama or Florida or whatever RB. ,eagles,cggkked,7,t5_2qi5w

731001,0,t1_cgncff6,You are clearly blind or dont know football.  Kendricks is almost always around the ball.  Despite his inconsistencies at times he is a fairly good starter.  His speed allows him to do some incredible things in coverage for a linebacker and there are only  TEs in the league faster than him...thats a good thing.  TEs pose a matchup problem for safeties since theyre too small and LBs because theyre too slow.  Kendricks while shorter is big enough to handle them one on one in some cases.  Is he perfect no but hes a young ascending player that was drafted in the second round and was in his second defense in two seasons.  Maybe youd prefer Ernie Sims who went for the big play all the time and NEVER made any?!Demeco is also good though he isnt the pro bowler he was he played the most snaps of any LB in the league.

Foles seems to have those three attributes in spades.Edit I think Foles fits the scheme perfectly because he is smart enough to take on the decision making responsibilities that the Chip Kelly offense requires.

894709,0,t3_24d765,We address some of these questions in our Wiki  Start there and scroll down.To expand on your questions.. Club seats are usually taken up by season ticket holders and people with SBL contracts.  I sat in the club section a few times but I wouldnt say it is all that much worth it.  They have a nice bar inside with a better selection of draft beers and they have a side table cash only that has about  craft bottles available.  The food selection is a bit better as well.  You have access to the standard food but they also have some fancier stuff.  When I was there last I got Buffalo Chicken Sliders with freshly made potato chips that was paired with a Yards IPA.  It was good but wouldnt make or break the area. The bathrooms are nice and you dont have to wait long if at all.  There are less people in the Club Area so you dont get the congestion you would get from the Upper and Lower section.  Sometimes they have Former Player signings in the Club Lobby area.  If you care about that stuff you might try to get seats there.. I know guys that do this.  They take disposable coolers on the train and then toss them away when they are done. However they usually meet up with someone or make friends there and hang out.  Generally you can hang out at any tailgate if you offer them some beer.  There is also Xfinity Live right a cross the street.  You could get your drink on there if you didnt feel comfortable tailgating in the lot.  I am not sure what games I am going to this year yet but if I end up at the Jags game you are more than welcome to hang out at my car.  . Shouldnt be a problem as long as she isnt harassing people.  She might get heckled a little but nothing terrible.  There really isnt a lot of bad blood between the Eagles and the Jaguars.  I wouldnt sweat it.. Double Tree in Center City is nice and it is right by the public transit.  If you want to stay closer to the stadium there is the Holiday Inn Express nearby.  As for Cheesesteaks everyone will tell you something different.  Personally I would stay away from PatsGenos on gameday. It is a major tourist trap.  I would say Jims is the place to go for the best and Tony Lukes is near the stadium if you want to stay close.

1494818,0,t3_2bbg8p,Ill address your negative points individuallyHarder schedule Definitely something to be concerned with but take solace in the fact that the rest of the division has to play largely the same teams. The last five weeks are going to be a bitch but with so many divisional games late it also gives us the chance to salvage a slow start. Also schedules look very different now and in the middle of the season. If last year I had said We have to play Houston Atlanta and Washington to close out the season! Were screwed! that would have been a very legitimate point.Kelly Sophomore Slump Youre talking like Kellys feet are set in lead and that the Eagles are going to come out looking like the same team we were last year. Kellys number one trait is adaptation and versatility. There was an article posted earlier this week that hypothesized Kelly only used half his playbook last year. I think the advantages that come with a year of experience outweigh the negatives.Injuries Not going to argue there we got lucky last year. Hopefully sports science works its magic again. He have pretty good depth though especially on the offensive side of the ball.East cant be any worse I think the Redskins with a new coach and Dallas with no Shaun Lee can be just as bad as they were last year. The Giants worry me but they need a running back and Eli is always unpredictable. Also Coughlin isnt on the hot seat. Your reasons are definetely valid and can be argued either way but I dont think youre giving the team especially Kelly enough credit. Just my two crappy cents. Let Foles be with us.,eagles,cj3nf5n,4,t5_2qi5w
1530606,0,t1_cj7ve37,These are good points. Still of concern though  I know Chip does not rely on a  guy to make every play but he had a  guy who defenses always had to account for and while I dont pretend to know everything about creating offensive schemes I have to think that opened up a lot of the mismatches he always likes to talk about. Unless Maclin or Matthews can fill that gap as a  guy that scares defenses and maybe they can Chip seems to get the most out of his personnel makes every other option that much more difficult. This one I am still just as nervous about. Ive just seen too many QBs  especially ones who werent expected to start  take the league by surprise and have a killer season only to struggle immensely ever after. But whatever Im not sure anyone can ease my worries on this matter. Everything I saw Foles do points to him being legit but until he starts doing it again this season Im going to be afraid that  games isnt conclusive. Your point about Chip is probably the best one. Thinking back to everything leading up to the start of last season and then the coverage each week in between games its not like Chip was secretive about how his offense worked. From conditioning to nohuddling to his pick your poison routes and formations he never relied on the other team having no idea what to expect. And even if that did play a role Chip strikes me as the type of guy who doesnt rest on his laurels so I can imagine hes never satisfied with the playbook and is constantly trying to innovate and throw in new looks. ,eagles,cj84zq4,1,t5_2qi5w

2007945,0,t3_2hqngf,My take Our Oline or lack thereof is killing us. Shady isnt getting holes like he is used to but he refuses to adapt. Foles struggles with the deep passes I gave him a pass the first few times but this is becoming a trend.  Im hesitant to say shitty playcalling but I would have liked to see us run it that close to the goalline...On a positive note The offense was absolute shit but I was encouraged that they showed up at the end of the game. That was a clutch drive by Foles and co. even if it ended badly. The defense played well better. We got pressure on the QB. We got a few clutch stops. That secondary thing that other teams seem to have made an appearance on a few plays this week for us.  Special teams and Sproles. Nuff said.

You could have two teams wear old fashioned uniforms and play using old rules.  If you are concerned about finding people willing to do it you could try collegiate rugby players.Probably wouldnt work on its own but if it was incorporated into another event that draws a crowd the cause would get lots of attention and at least stay fresh in peoples memory.Check out this for an example of anachronistic sports Also for what its worth the Rosenbach Foundation in Philly has readings from James Joyces Ulysses every year.  Im certain that this event has informed many many people that the foundation has priceless manuscripts written by Joyce.If you managed to pull something like this off Im sure you could get lots of viral or journalistic exposure and spread the word that the Pottstown Maroons are the true  NFL champions.Spectacle is attention grabbing and motivational petitions on their own?

IMO thats pretty good for a second year qb who never played a full season and had to work with the bad news bears blocking for you. For comparison peyton mannings second year TDs  INTS  yards . passer rating.Drew Breess second year in the league TDs  INTs  yards . passer rating Granted Nick needs to cut down on the amount of INTs but that will come with experience in the league. Peyton through for more INTs then TDs his rookie season andrew luck threw  INTs his rookie year and last year in the playoffs he threw  INTs. QBs learn to cut down with mistakes as they get older. Regardless Im tired of this reactionary attitude that almost all philly sports fans have. OMG HE THREW  INTS WE MUST GET RID OF HIM SOOO NOOB  FFS yes hes deserved credit for their record HES THE GODDAM QB THE TEAM RISES AND FALLS WITH HIM which btw was  under him not I kinda hope we get rid of him and then see him become a perennial  probowler maybe then this fan base then wont be so fucking crazy about calling for the heads of people that have  or  bad games. ,eagles,cm4q3zk,2,t5_2qi5w

DBs in general more ILBs some OLine depth heck even another DL or WR Id take over a QB. I like Foles that much. Sanchez is Sanchez.

But Ive been wondering and someone who knows more about defensive schemes than me will have to chime in how much of this has to do with Billy Davis scheme? I hear analysts and commentators say the scheme leaves them on an island a lot of the time and as far as I can tell a huge amount of the plays come with a safety nowhere in sight. My question is how much can we realistically expect out of corners in this scheme? It seems to me without Sherman and Revisor any CB of that pedigree were gonna give up the plays simply because a DB cant lock down man to man cover on a receiver for  plays a game for an entire season unless theyre a superstar like Sherman and Revis.

Matthews same thing.  Though Johnson was eatten alive by Kerrigan and has had his ups and downs.We wanted Dion from some reports over Lane and also wanted Haha Kyle Fuller as well as a few others that we didnt get.  Talent evaluation remains to be seen I think theyve done alright.  Huff could shape up as well.  Most of his mistakes are bonehead mental mistakes of a guy with his head not in the game.  Hes probably thinking too much.  The game will slow down for him.I fully understand your frustration though.   Think about DeSeans situation as a Rookie.  Reggie Brown got hurt and DeSean was forced into that starting role.  Chip is not going to sit a starter unless the backup prove they deserve it.  I am beginning to disagree with him on that.  DeSean would have eventually overtaken brown sure.  But what if DeSean was a gamer and not a practice guy?  We could be missing out on some talent by not moving people. The flip side is behind Coop we have Huff... Chip knows better than us how ready he is.  Do you think Brad Smith is the answer?  The Bradley Fletcher thing is insane though.

I very very much doubt that though. Dont see either leaving the top . If I had to guess Id say Chips currently up late at night watching tape on guys like Garrett Grayson Brett Hundley Sean Mannion etc. Mind you its a bit early to judge these things so who knows. Brett Hundley might end up a top  pick by March.That is unless weve got one via trade but that seems unlikely tbh.

2885391,0,t3_2t2atf,Mariota looks like he has the potential to be what this franchise has lacked at qb since McNabb was traded.  Id be ok moving forward with Foles and  good DBs drafted in the first few rounds.  But theres just as good a chance those DBs are busts as the chances Mariota will be.  Not to mention the secondary can feasibly be fixed without high draft picks being spent on those positions.  Sign a mid level corner my favorite is Kareem Jackson give Boykin a shot on the outside and honestly Im not as low on Nate Allen as everybody else seems to be.  He made some huge mistakes but he also forced several key turnovers more than most safeties this year. As he grows and matures those mistakes will lessen.  Then there may even be some later round steals in the draft at CB notably Ifo and Josh Shaw who will both fall due to injury and character concerns respectively.  But both of these guys have great instincts and ability when healthy.  Obviously its risky but this is the NFL.  Every move you make is risky.  Its not very often a talent like Mariota comes along and its even less often that said talent fits a coach so perfectly.  If it can be done for a reasonable amount of picks and a player or two I say do it.    ,eagles,cnw2kyc,1,t5_2qi5w

He could certainly do more like the radio show on WIP he had Howie do instead but he seems open and honest to me when he does talk.There were two disastrous first round picks when Howie was GM.  First Watkins and now extremely likely but not at all certain Smith.  He was the GM during the dream team fiasco.  Its completely unclear how much responsibility he actually had for all of that because the Eagles arent really open about who is really calling the shots but the fact is during his tenure as GM the Eagles had a spotty record with picking players.  So he did a lot of things well there were also some epic hits in talent acquisition during his tenure but I think if you really want to be a team that builds through the draft you need better consistency.

Im sure they expected to get a little more production out of him but anyone labeling this guy a bust after one year is listening to too much radio. You cant truly judge this guy until after his rd season. And while he didnt register a tackle all year I made sure to watch him while he was in the game. There were things I liked and things I didnt.

You being able to hand select people who became stars just proves my point also kind of baffling that you didnt name Aaron Rodgers there hahai didnt pick rogers because i only used two years sure i could go back and find guys like rogers but i chose to go back  years and look at two draft classes and found  all pro arguable top  players at there position in each one so there far from diamonds in the rough. there was also multiple really really good starters in each one that i didnt mention.gtWell if we draft Mariota Im assuming that the Eagles would immediately trade Foles since theres zero chance wed keep him after his rookie deal ends next year to try and get at least one more pick in this draft or the next to lessen the blow that trading up everyone is worried about so Mariota would be the clear cut starter going into the season if he were to become an Eagle.what? you claimed foles was not a clear cut starter if thats the case then foles is definitely the clear cut starter now??? my point was that mariota is not more sure a deal than foles gtDont you find it interesting that the three teams that you picked all got lucky and had franchise QBs fall into their lap? indeed they all got there qbs outside of the top  how many teams that took qbs taken in the top  are winning superbowls at the moment? look what happened the redskins they got there franchise guy and a guy with a similar skill set and similar questions to mariota and found they had no picks to build a team around him.in theory we have a good team now but we need to improve our secondary there are questions with our pass rush due to agecontracts and ageing oline and if we get rid of shady as you stated above we need a starting running back id rather not do all of that in free agency the late rounds. you claim that a late st round pick is not worth that much but plan on building a team with late rounders. ,eagles,cowolx5,1,t5_2qi5w

3316510,0,t1_cp6ancm,Sorry I think I was being unclear. When I say  I dont mean the first option youre right the slot guy can be your best receiver and your first option I mean the top guy who plays outside. When referring to WRs  amp  are usually the outside guys and  is your slot guy. It doesnt mean  cant be your best receiver get the most yards etc...but the outside guys are the WR and WR positions. Kelly drafted Matthews specifically for the slot that is not to say he cant be moved outside but we cannot expect the same level of success outside as we saw last year on the slot. He will get much better coverage and it is a more difficult position to play much harder to get open especially without blazing speed which Matthews lacks. Therefore I think in any depth chart released without Maclin on it youre going to see Cooper listed in the  spot and Matthews MOST LIKELY in the  spot even if he gets more overall snaps than Cooper which he obviously should IMO.,eagles,cp6b5xf,6,t5_2qi5w

Kelly scared away Gore and looks like a fucking fool today not just to us but to the league. Reputation is everything and Chip isnt creating a good one. This is boom or bust. Hes either got some master plan or is getting chased out of this city with pitchforks. Im leaning toward the latter. What the hell has Chip done to deserve any form of trust? He hasnt won shit. ,eagles,cpauxqr,6,t5_2qi5w

3368512,0,t1_cpbmq1d,Nope. I posted this elsewhere and it was buried. But he has not incentive to be honest at this point and the more he sells Bradford as his guy the more it inflates Bradfords trade value. Im going to play conspiracy theorist here and assume that Chip was bluffing today. The Bradford trade makes more sense that way. Im working under the assumption that Bradford is still going to be traded... So lets assume that he is for this thought experiment. If we trade Bradford  other players Demarco?  Kiko?  Kendricks? to move up in the draft this year the only net loss is that  nd round pick and Foles plus our  first and maybe our  first... Because remember the  th was basically free!  from Buffalo for Bryce Brown Additionally we would get the extra rd rounder next year plus the th rounder this year that could potentially also be used in a larger package to move up this year. And with The Browns looking for another QB and having  first round picks this year there is a market for an outlandish trade of this nature.  Bold prediction  the draft day trade will ultimately involve them and Tennessee in a three way that gets us the  overall. Bet on it. ,eagles,cpc8hx6,1,t5_2qi5w

It doesnt make him a liar to say hes unwilling to trade a large number of resources to acquire him.And on the point of our front office changes I dont see how you can claim Kelly lied. It ultimately was Luries decision how control is structured in the organization. Chip claims he didnt demand any changes but that he communicated his vision to Lurie. Where is your grounds for calling Chip a liar? Then the Murray acquisition. It very well couldve been contingent on Gores decision. Gore was our first choice and when that didnt pan out we pursued Murray. It could very well be the case that we werent in on Murray and heavily pursuing him the next day.

Under Big Red he and QB and usually one player on D were the only ones youd really hear from consistently.

3763888,0,t1_cql57gp,Thing is amp what I think many people are overlooking is that these teams are picking this high for a reason. Peoples jobs are on the line. These high picks cant be used on a chance for most of these teams. Picking Mariota would be laughably dumb for the Skins when theyre in position to possibly get Leonard Williams or any other game changing talent that can step in day . Why would Gruden want another system QB when he clearly wants more of pocket passer? The skins would definitely trade with us to get up there...wed be giving them multiple years firsts amp other picks to get up there. Jets could possibly take him but there are other holes they need to fill amp Mariota isnt a sure thing at QB. Hes going to need time to learn amp you already picked a QB high a few years ago. Bears is a possible destination but Im not sure I see John Fox wanting to waste that th pick on a QB with a lot of question marks when there is a ton of game changing talent to be had there.Falcons? A team with glaring holes almost everywhere but QB amp receiver is going to take Mariota? I hope they do thatd be idiotic. When you step back amp look at Mariota for what he is...hes a system guy who is going to struggle at this level for some time. The only way you could possibly avoid that would be to run a spread system. Plus the big questions with his personality amp leadership abilities I think he drops. ,eagles,cqlb823,2,t5_2qi5w

We always hype these guys up so much but the truth is the majority are not going to live up to these lofty expectations we heap on them. The difference for me with Mariota is that our coach has the inside scoop on him since he was already his coach. He knows that the kid can and cant do better than any other NFL coach. That makes me much more comfortable about swallowing the cost of getting him if chip chooses to go that route. Im not sold he will be willing to buy at an inflated trade price. ,eagles,cqlddhe,4,t5_2qi5w

What we got last year was an unexpected gift for sureThere were some legit concerns about him that was true.  But these concerns were no where close to big enough to think that he could get outplayed by a rookie.  He was still the clear starter and was expected to hold that position.   This was not surprising.gtWhich is why he is no longer on the team nowHe is not with the team because of his contract not because of his play.gtBarwin had already played in a  before in his career and had  sacks his first year with chip. He tripled his production last year. NOBODY predicted that.Once again he did exceed expectations but everyone still expected him to be the starter and maintain that role.   No one expected him to lose his job to a rookie.gtHowever theres a reason they panicked and reached for him early and it was because that was viewed as a position of need.Long term it was a position of need.  We knew Cole wouldnt be around forever.  They drafted him for the long term picture not to be a day  starter.gtI took issue with you saying Going into last season like our pass rush was expected to be a strengthI never said it was a strength.   I just said he was behind multiple veteran players that he wasnt going to beat.  ,eagles,cr6yv3c,1,t5_2qi5w

Id like to see Darren Sproles put in the slot more and give him chances to beat slower linebackers. This is going to be a fun bunch to watch this year if they stay healthy and happy.  This is where Chip is going to earn his money. Keep the ball moving. Rack up lots of first downs and score lots of touchdowns.  Give the defense a chance to catch their breath because Defense wins championships.  The  group of running backs although successful didnt win squat.

He can help them with route running and all sorts of things.And actually the younger players helping to teach him the playbook will also improve their understanding of it.gt I think stuff like this is just nonsense the media and fans use to justify keeping old over the hill players around.And yet they cut Mathis and you were upset. He was at the least one of those things. Over the hill...PFF said he he declined some.

Murray was still there they reached out Bradford reached out badda big badda boom. I really believe Chips explanation with it. Either way I couldnt be happier.

I dont have a problem with the Eagles keeping Tebow after seeing what he did last night.  Mostly because Im thinking back to how bad Barkley looked when he got his chances in the regular season.  And with the pressure on last night the guy played awful.  So fuck it Ive been saying that maybe Barkley has improved.  But the guy couldnt even step up in preseason game  when hes only playing to be the rd QB.  How is he going to get the job done when the Eagles are fighting for a playoff spot and he has to go in.  And then of course Tebow comes out with the pressure on and looks good somehow.  Ill give him credit I still dont have much faith in the guy when it comes to playing QB.  But at least he showed the possibility of him playing well.  Hes also a good locker room presence so that helps his case.,eagles,cuqwui0,1,t5_2qi5w

I expect the Falcons defense to be much improved and the offense about the same until they get the run game going will probably take a few weeks for that. The Eagles look to be really good on both sides of the ball this year and I think Sam Bradford will prove to be a nice upgrade at QB.

Youre a dumb ass who thinks just because its your opinion means its a definite sure fire thing that Bill needs to go. I have seen plenty of evidence over the last  years the Bill Davis can be a good DC. Williams and Fletcher did not help him out at all last year. Being in the wrong place frequently. Just because there were mistakes made doesnt mean oh he should be fired. It was the first game of the season. Its a long season. There is no need to argue or panic over anything. Quit being a dumb ass and just cheer your team on. Your a fan for a reason. Nothing more. Go Eagles  Fuck Dallas and the Giants. ,eagles,cv46a46,1,t5_2qi5w

5444042,0,t3_3pm92o,gtThird in the league in passes defensed A lot of great information in here but that stat stuck out to me the most. Our secondary is leaps and bounds ahead of where it was last year.The fact that this defense is putting up these kind of numbers in takeaways yards per play against points against etc. while they continue to spend more time on the field and face more plays than any other defense is nothing short of miraculous.

5444516,0,t3_3pmglh, Which players stood out the most last week?Nolan Carrol Dude is a has been a stud this season at corner for us and has performed much better than his counterpart Maxwell. People are saying Eli gifted it but it was a great jam at the line by Carrol followed by a nice read. He was in perfect coverage on a couple other plays.  Demeco Ryans  The INT changed the game and he followed it up on the next drive with a nice tackle for a loss.  Bennie Logan and Fletcher Cox  These two were getting penetration all game which led to multiple sacks and out of place throws.   Demarco Murray  had a couple nice runs and looks like he is finally starting to find his groove.   Who do you expect to make the biggest impact in Sundays game?Some key matchups are going to be between the Eagles defensive line and the the Carolina front . If the Eagles can run the ball I think you guys are in trouble because that opens up the playbook for Chip Kelly.  Other key matchup is going to be the Eagles LBs and safeties covering Olsen and keeping contain on Cam. My guess is they will have Barwin spying Cam and Hicks or Jenkins will be covering Olsen all game. People keep bringing up the Seattle and how Olsen torched them but I wouldnt go so fast here. Seattle is st against the TE and the Eagles are th so I would look for a good battle here. I am honestly not afraid of your WRs with Benjamin on the IR none of your WRs scare me. Our corners seem to struggle with big WRs a lot more than small fast guys.  What specifically are you guys watching for?I am looking for Bradford to try to find a rhythm he has been off since coming back which regardless of what people are saying should be expected. He hasnt played in  years. I am also looking for some battles in the trenches on both sides of the ball. It will be import for our line to collapse the pocket and maintain the lanes against Cam. I also think it will be important for our line to get movement and open up some holes for the running game. Are there any key injuries that will affect the game?Our O line has been banged up but played well against the Giants and looks like they are slowly getting healthy. Two key injuries are that Kiko Alonso is probably still out but I am sure they will be hopeful Kendricks returns. These are really the only big injuries most guys have returned the last two weeks. I wouldnt say these two injuries are huge since Hicks and Ryans are better than most teams starting MLBs I mean Hicks is the rd ranked MLB by PFF and great in coverage so he would probably be on the field regardless.  How do you feel about Bradford? Is he a fit for Chips system?People keep on bringing up fits for the system. Chip doesnt have a specific fit. He needs a guy who can make good decisions and reads quick and hit his throws. In this regard Bradford has a history of being that kind of player. This year not so much he has made some poor decisions and has been offtarget a number of times. I think both of these things are correctable and should work themselves out as he continues to acclimate himself back to NFL speed.  How do you guys feel about the media putting Chip on the hot seat?Chip isnt in the hotseat. Media bullshit is media bullshit for clicks and ratings. Chip will be Eagles coach through the end of his contract at a minimum and everyone knows it. Any other relevant information for this game that you feel like Panthers fans should know going into the game. Dont underestimate the Eagles defense they are  overall by Football Outsiders in defensive efficiency and cause a lot of turnovers. The biggest weakness is covering number  WRs which you guys dont currently have since he is on your IR. Also tell people in your sub to stop coming over here and being assholes.,eagles,cw7l8az,4,t5_2qi5w

Let us not forget that the oline has looked terrible until maybe halfway through the redskins game. I think once the rest of the offense stops making stupid mistakes Kelce in particular all of the drops and miscues and run the ball consistently well than lets see what he has. Also our top WR in JM is playing just OK with a ton of drops and doesnt pose as a deep threat...Agholor is a rookie and is playing like one...and Cooper is well you know....I hope to God Bradford comes out sharp on Sunday night and we go into the bye with something to look forward to.,eagles,cw7tsxo,1,t5_2qi5w

Talent wise we are a better and deeper team than Green Bay other than Quarterback which they have us blown out of the water.

Its obviously a case of us having to accept that part of the reason we suck is bad play from our WRs. Its also time to accept that drops make Matthews look bad statistically. Russell Shepard is nd with  targets and  reception I mean come on. Id take Matthews getting open and dropping a couple of balls over a guy who can barely get  snaps and doesnt see the ball. You cant compare that shit obviously Matthews is playing better than Shepard despite having regressed hugely. But yes theres a problem thanks PFF no Eagles fan had the idea that our WRs might be playing a little poor.  ,eagles,cwefj08,2,t5_2qi5w

5503093,0,t3_3qgvyw,Tobin has been solid since he has been in line. He filled in well for Peters comparatively to the huge shoes Peters left and has been a solid guard since coming in for Gardner. There havent been huge changes to the scheme of the offensive line center and guards still pull on outside runs and there has been a major improvement in the running game. Coincidence? Probably but in no way has Tobin been a liability.  is a little chart of the stats with  games where Gardner started and the first three games Tobin did.

5579299,0,t1_cwonday,gtWith those guys they only went .. Only...XD. Werent you one of the people toting  wins in his first two seasons!!! as evidence of Kellys prowess?. The offense was NEVER the problem. Pretending otherwise is revisionist. Defense was the problem. I didnt say Foles was good. He was adequate last year although his turnovers were an aberration.  As a player I think hes somewhere between  and . Hes good enough. He was better last year than Bradford this year though. If  is Foles ceiling thats better than anything any team has seen from Bradford who costs way more.I would have been fine playing this year out with Foles. Youd get another chance to see if he could hack it and if not youre badially in the same boat anyway. Instead we wasted a second and fourth rounder to bring in a guy who isnt any better at all and costs way more. Youre the one blathering on about time to adjust for a five year vet. Its been seven games and hes still not adjusted. At least Foles knew the offense and required no adjustment time. The offense never ran faster than under Foles. Kelly was  with Foles under center hes  with other QBs. Say what you want about Foles but hes a winner. he had us in position to win every game he started at the end and more often than not came away with the win.

THAT is why Im frustrated because Bradford hasnt shown me that he has the minimum Level of talent it takes to win a Super Bowl when we dont have other facets of the game good enough to compensate for his flaws.gt I cant give up on Bradford until our receivers start catching the ball.Im not suggesting anyone else starts just that I havent seen good enough play and Im extremely frustrated and this is the place to vent that frustration.I havent called for anyones head to roll just asking people to stop blindly circle jerking these guys.

Obviously Chip knows the team way better than we do but I cant really forgive him for putting out the same players who suck every week.Look at what other teams do. Harbaugh just cut some of their chumps who werent playing well. Starters. Didnt bench them he fucking cut their asses. Tomlin cut that kicker who missed two kicks in his first game. You have to punish underperforming players. Bill Belichick cut Burnt Toast a few weeks ago.

It was not supposed to be it was not touted as one NO ONE said it was rebuilding year.Everyone said division title! with a few ....or bust under their breath.Calling it a rebuilding season now is retroactive justification for just a poor season from top to bottom in all facets of the game.Now with saner heads it sounds more legitimate. A blown up roster playing for the first time together new culture or whatever. I get it. Thats got rebuilding written all over it.But it was Chips system. It was supposed to be plug and play with any decent people and he got his picks to fill those spots. And the team looks awful.This system of his so far just looks like what a lot of people have been saying the new gimmick in the league that is successful for a couple years and once everyone figures it out it doesnt work. And Chip just hasnt shown himself to be a good enough coachGMwhatever to overcome his system not working and adjust to personnels strengthsweaknesses or the reality of play. Which would make sense to me since gimmicks like this work at the college level for a long time. If he hit something that worked why would he try anything else? He just didnt develop something about coaching in the college level necessary to long term success in the NFL.But hell he could stick around and be super successful next year and I could look like an idiot.

If Chip tries to get rid of Jenkins this offseason then fuck Chip he should be gone if he cant take criticism from a man who had more success at this level than him he should be gone.

5891679,0,t1_cxrx5l3,True the context of his conversation with Lurie has everything to due with it. I dont think a player should speak up about whatever they want outside of the locker room though. I think Sammy went overboard in his opinion and not entirely sure he isnt trolling but I agree with a lot of his sentiments. Another point to be made is that the coaches said since the day of Murrays signing that there was not to be a featured back and that carries were supposed to be distributed evenly. That is what the guy signed up for. Maybe it is my personal bias from years past and maybe I am also being excessive in my labeling when I say it but if he is talking to the owner about about wanting to be a featured back at this point in the season than I would say it is a bitch move. We dont know what the conversation actually consisted of though so you are right we should reserve judgement at this point.,eagles,cxrxlyc,1,t5_2qi5w

Looking at their injury report it doesnt seem like any key players are likely to miss the game anyway so Im not sure how much a few days rest changes things.So I guess they have a few extra days to gameplan for our offense... but Chip has run permutations of the same  plays every game for the last  years.

5974750,0,t1_cy2sziz,I honestly wouldnt be shocked if they resign Cooper for significantly less money who else will bid on him? Beyond that I agree with you they need to get better at WR I just dont see the team spending more draft picks on the position and I dont see them having many options in FA even if they can afford it. I think that at least for next season the team has to bank on their first round WR developing into a  and hoping that Matthews can shake his sophomore slump while continuing to develop Huff. ,eagles,cy2tkhq,5,t5_2qi5w
5976665,0,t1_cy2ytc7,Yea true I feel like they could use a DL that can pass rush from the edge too since Marcus Smith doesnt look like hes going to be more than a rotational player at this point. Personally Id prefer they go OL with the first pick if anything. I feel like Matthews is having a down year and will bounce back and we will still have Sproles and Ertz as pass catching threats. Even if he never becomes a true number  you just have to bank on Agholor improving to some extent.

I dont know how you build a program in one year.thats the full quote about chip. Great coach overall did a good job in philly. Hes not going to badmouth Chip He doesnt say the eagles are fucked now or made a mistake firing chip he just says how thats the reality of the NFL and its unfortunate.  makes plenty of sense after THREE seasons to move on from a coach that has trended down each season especially after giving him more control to speed up the process.

I understand he is our best option going into next season most likely but we just cant afford that risk at his salary.I mean honestly we could cut him draft a tackle use the rest of the money to sign two solid veteran guards and our line is just as good as in your scenario.I do think hell restructure though I think both him and the Eagles have no intentions of parting ways. Im just worried we are going to be loyal to him and next thing we know Bradford is getting killed again because we have no young talent at tackle when Peters is crawling off the field halfway through next season.The best scenario IMO is that he restructures and moves to guard assuming his back can hold up at guard.

I love Treadwell but he is not the guy for our team. We should only take a WR in the first if its an allworld talent and Treadwell isnt that. Hes built and has good hands and solid technique but he doesnt have great speed to get separation in the NFL. Having a blocker like Conklin or Decker will most likely help our passing game much more  by giving Sam I pray more time to throw and  an improved running game takes pressure off the QB and will leave less guys in coverage on average.Im confident Matthews Agoholor Huff are all going to improve in the offseason and will be a solid unit next year if we keep Sam and make those two desperately needed additions to the OL.,eagles,cypy9un,1,t5_2qi5w

6209408,0,t3_40mzvp,I think Pederson comes in as head coach and keeps Shurmur around as OC.  This will ensure we keep Bradford.  Even though Pederson is a new guy I dont think hell want to do a total rebuild he is a QB guy and would probably like to work  with Bradfords skill set. No clue who comes in as DC but it will not be Billy Davis. Maybe it will be a big splash former HC who wants to rebuild value i.e. Lovie Smith or Jim Schwartz.  Or maybe its an up and comer who wants to take the next step like Rocky Seto or Al Holcomb. Thats really up in the air. Id like to see us take a run at Mohammed Sanu in free agency.  I think he could complement our guys well and can simply catch the football. That will also relegate Huff to WRKR which is more his speed. I really hope we bolster the OL big time.  Sign BooneBrooks and draft one of the big OTs in the first round.  You can groom them while also starting them inside at guard.  That will give us a much more solid line and move GarnderTobinBarbre back to the reserve roles that they fit.  The defense the new coordinator decides to run will determine who stays and goes in FA.  If he wants a true strong safety then Thurmond is gone.  If he wants to run a  Curry  Thornton are gone.  I think Carroll is gone regardless he will get priced out by being a decent CB. The one thing we must do is extend Cox. Has to happen. Hopefully we are able to restructure Peters and a few other guys to lower their cap hits and open up some space for us to make a few key moves Bradford Cox BooneBrooks Sanu etc.  I dont see any big splash moves like last off season but hopefully some smart ones that will help us both short and long term.

All three facets need to be working well above league average to have an extended multiyear shot at a super bowl.The best teams draft their talent and build their core through the draft.Just winning games here and now can be extremely short sighted and could lead to further mediocrity.The end goal is winning a fucking super bowl,eagles,cz47zoh,-2,t5_2qi5w

6306032,0,t1_cz5j17o,I think you have it a bit backwards  just look at the recent prototype guys. Willis would be the perfect  guy he was much faster than he was strong. The taking on blocks thing is backwards too because most  lineman are run first guys soaking up blocks. The olb blitz on a singular primary or alternating basis so the oline has to account for them. The ilb are more rangy clean up or cover guys depending on the offensive play. In a  you have  guys always dedicated to the blitz or maintaining the LOS. Then  completely unique lber roles first is Sam or strong side who lines up usually on te side or to the qbs faceL handed vs. R handed. The same is the guy who usually catches the first lead blocker on runs or covers the te. Hes bigger and taller and tougher doesnt have to be super fast because hes already closest to the start of the play. Then the MLB hes a bit rangy plays zone alot and needs to be ably to navigate run lanes to clog gaps. Think keuckly very cerebral and instinctive great tackler strong but definitely not as fast as the prototype  guy Willis. The final  guy is the will or weakside guy. Thus guy is usually the quickest of the bunch cuz he plays in space or sometimes slides out to cover slot receivers. He chases down plays from behind alot. And doesnt catch the brunt of the blocks. But with all this said the scheme description of  vs.  is very elementary. Its much more precise to understand it in gap description and assignments. That detail is unique to each team though.,eagles,cz6fay4,1,t5_2qi5w

The performance or rather the lack thereof he showed last year.  gt Quite frankly nobody is asking you if his tape shows a lot to build on since it so obviously does to anyone with a good faith approach.  Then why are you responding to my opinion?  If you dont care for it ignore it.  Doesnt bother me one bit.  gt Waldman spends an hour and a half watching ONE GAME and has a much much higher opinion of him than you. And his qualifications run a bit deeper than I never expect  yards from Eagles players  Well good for him but I never stated my qualification and just because somebody spends that long dissecting one player and thinks he has upside doesnt mean the player actually has upside.  Ray Rhodes watched a ton of tape on Mike Mamula and thought he had huge upside except he didnt.  Im glad you found somebody who echoes your belief in Agholor.  Thats great.  That doesnt mean hes going to learn how to get separation or catch the ball when it hits his hands this season.  Dont get me wrong  I would love to be wrong about this but the fact is the Eagles receivers almost uniformly sucked last season.  Our best receiver was middle of the NFL road and everyone else was well south of that.  Its not like Agholor didnt get opportunities.  Yeah I know he was injured.  For  games.  Even if the injury lingered he still started  games and wasnt noticeable in any of them.  His numbers sucked.  His performances sucked.  Ive seen this before.  It doesnt end well.

Yes he admitted there were some missteps with Chip.Hes not perfect but every step of the way I always see a guy who wants nothing less than a Super Bowl title on Broad Street. I love the passion he has as an owner yet he always and I mean always steps aside and doesnt meddle in the GMs or HCs business. Players love him and I do too. If this blows up in Howies face or if Pederson just became another average coach I think Lurie will have no trouble firing either or both. However at this time we need to be more supportive. Other poster is speaking the truth in saying we need to stop hoping for FAILURE for our team. Trust me when I say I wasnt ecstatic with the trade to  but Ive listened to the rationale and Im gonna stop short of fully embracing the move. Im pretty much in the wait and see stage and hoping for SUCCESS. Either way its done so theres no point in wasting time discussing why we shouldnt have traded.,eagles,d2e2gan,8,t5_2qi5w

7378996,0,t3_4geyvr,To be honest Im gonna have to defend Sam here for a second.I dont think this has anything to do with competition. If it did I think Sam would be up to the challenge. I believe it has everything to do with the future and his place on this team.When the Eagles signed Bradford before the start of free agency Im sure he was told that the team wanted to give him a chance to prove himself to show that he could be the guy. They werent willing to commit to him long term but they were going to give him the opportunity to show what he can do. So he signed the contract and was probably energized to go out there and perform.Fast forward and then the following happens The Eagles overpay for a career back up The Eagles begin the most conspicuous quarterback search of all time The Eagles spend a ton of draft capital to move up and draft Carson WentzIn a span of a few months Sam Bradford went from being given the opportunity to prove his worth to just a seat warmer for the heir apparent. If the Eagles had drafted a QB in the rd I dont think he would have minded but the fact that the Eagles spent so much to get Wentz just shows that they arent committed to Sam at all.You can make an argument that Sam Bradford hasnt done enough in this league to be worthy of a safe starting job. However you cant tell me he wasnt handed a raw deal here. What he was sold and what happened are two completely different things.Well see how the next few days and weeks play out. I believe Bradford will be on this team and will be the starting QB week . I dont think hes the type of guy to sit out and hurt his team and his own value.Im not ready to throw Sam under the bus. Hes been a consummate pro in his time here. Im not thrilled that hes trying to force the Eagles hand but I certainly dont blame him either.,eagles,d2gxvjz,14,t5_2qi5w

With content like All breakdowns and a litany of practice observations we can form our own opinions about the players without blindly ingesting information from the few main papers that were covering the Eagles in the s and early s.

I was hoping the Eagles would pick up a player like this although more for the fullback position than as a lineman. McGowan though hes basically unusable as a tight end at the pro level. Dude runs a . .  Literally anybody with two functional legs can do that. He has okay hands and is too tall to be anything other than a backup guard. I guess he might be okay in goal line situations but so would any big tight end with much better athleticism. Smart awesome person though.

After Aikman retied they missed on Quincy Carter in the nd round of the  draft. In  they signed Romo as an undrafted FA after not drafting a QB in  or . As much as hate to admit it is a good QB who has made  PBs. So if you take it back to  which you should have or you should only go back to .

8651315,0,t3_4ye3g2,As some of you know Im a former journalist and its articles like these that remind me why. This is lazy clickbait masquerading as some sort of undercover piece.Take a look at the lede. The author lists the following as reasons why as the author puts it If there were gold medals in political corruption Philly would put Michael Phelps to shame.Those reasons?. FBI raided office of city councilman. Attorney General for entire state of PA is convicted of perjury. City Controller made accusation against former mayor. FBI raided office of city councilman yep thats the same story as the first pointNo new information here  just a collection of links to the articles meant to form the foundation of his shaky narrative. Next we dive into Philly DA Seth Williams who is under investigation. Note he hasnt been convicted of anything. Im not defending what he did because if true not disclosing  worth of gifts is a pretty big deal but its really where the author takes this that grinds my gears when he discusses the two all access sideline passes Williams received.gtYet it is those Eagles sideline passes that should raise as many eyebrows as the obvious conflicts of interest presented by defense attorneys giving the DA money and vacations.See this is what is supposed to separate journalists from your racist uncle on Facebook. Journalists are supposed to work with facts. Theyre supposed to be focused on uncovering the truth to tell the story from beginning to end. Remember it was a journalist who took down Kathleen Kane by doing extremely diligent investigative work.I knew EXACTLY where the author was going to go with this but I hoped that he would at least have some evidence to support his claim.gtJust last month the DA declined to bring charges against Eagles receiver Nelson Agholor after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Philadelphia strip club.gtThen earlier this year in April Williams announced that his office would not press charges against former Eagles running back LeSean McCoy related to a bar brawl with offduty police officers.So you can see the logic the journalist is trying to work with here.Seth Williams received gifts from Eagles. Eagles players got in trouble. Therefore Seth Williams got them out of trouble.So what evidence does the author have to support this claim? Hes got a quote from the FOP president who has an agenda to protect police officers and obviously had a vested interest in the McCoy investigation. Thats it.But dont worry hes drawn the picture for you. You can fill in the blanks.gtIt is possible that Williams treated McCoy and Agholor just like any other criminal suspect. But can we be sure? Likewise how do we know defendants represented by attorneys who gave Williams gift cards and vacation homes did not receive more preferential treatment than someone represented by a public defender not greasing the DAs wheels?gtWe dont. And theres the rub.HOW CAN WE BE SURE?!?!You can be sure by doing your job as a journalist and investigating. But of course its much easier just to throw around accusations because itll get you plenty of clicks.Articles like these give journalists a bad name because they essentially throw out accusations and theres no negative recourse because Williams Agholor and McCoy are all Public Figures and thus proving things like Libel and Slander are EXTREMELY difficult.Theres no analysis here. No investigation. Just a bunch of points thrown together to build a shaky narrative and ask the audience to draw the conclusion that you carefully crafted. This is garbage and in my opinion there shouldnt be a place for it on this subreddit.,eagles,d6n107g,4,t5_2qi5w

8908009,0,t3_52adsf,Wentz played really well. I was really impressed by his willingness to make changes at the line. He utilized the hard count well to get penalties and to see where the blitz is coming from. The one thing that really stuck out was his decision making he didnt force anything and he took what the defense was giving him. And those two touchdown throws were absolutely on the money. Jordan Matthews had a great game he seems to have a strong rapport for Wentz. Ertz seems to be the safety blanket for Wentz I was hoping to see him have a couple more targets in the redzone but thats okay. Ryan Mathews had a solid solid game. Im glad he ended up with a TD. Darren Sproles was kind of disappointing as a receiver but he made some good plays as a punt returner. Barner had some good runs too. Eagles defense looked great. McLeod had a good game with a pick and a couple openfield tackles. McKelvin played well and I hope his hamstring is okay. Graham Cox and Barwin all had sacks. RG never looked comfortable in the pocket. ,eagles,d7im398,1,t5_2qi5w

Some of those tightwindow throws were very encouraging.  Sure one will get picked on a deflection or something at some point but who cares.

Now theyre asking a ton of him and hes short of the ability. Wentz made line adjustments and called all the plays from the huddle. He had normal NFL progressions. The main thing he is adjusting to is just the speed hes not having to learn how to call plays read defense make adjustments assign blockers recognize the blitz and make  reads per play all at once.

9037047,0,t1_d7wu9aa,Yeah I still dont love Howie but I do love part of the reasoning of taking Wentz that they were preparing for the eventual retirement of a lot of HoF QBs and even just really good QBs.  Someone posted an article a few months ago that mentioned some crazy number of starters retiring in the next  years or peaking and it was alarmingly high.  Even if Wentz only hovers around the top  that might be enough if the teams around us have garbage.  Think about the Ravens and Flacco.  I will be the first to admit that Flacco balled the fuck out during the SB run and was absolutely the best QB in the playoffs that year.  But they dont need him to be the best QB every year.  They need him to get them to the playoffs and perform and then it is anyones game.  That could be us while so many other teams are left scrambling.  And making the playoffs in the NFL is sometimes all you need to win the whole thing.Although I do think Wentz is the real deal.,eagles,d7y3yn3,1,t5_2qi5w

They had the most defensive plays out of any team and they still dominated. I dont think Wade Phillips made them custom smoothies or anything.They just had immense talent all over the field from Von Miller to Ware to Jackson to Talib to Trevathan to Harris to Ward.

With Vick hes another person I wish I could have watched have a REAL head coach develop him instead of letting him do whatever the hell he wants for most of his career. Had Andy been his coach from jump street who knows what Vick might have been able to accomplish. Kolb I KNEW was going to fail. Foles for me had that flash in the pan feel and I always stated I needed to see more and see BIG improvements in parts of his game.

There will be a dropoff from Lane to Vaitai but I think we will be pleasantly surprised. As for the Detroit game changing your opinion thats understandable but you must keep things within reason. It didnt make the win against a playoff bound Steelers team any less impressive.

Penalties.Theyve been killing themselves with penalties. If Cox doesnt hit Cousins late we dont have to score a TD to tie. Thats not the refs judgement that was a bad decision by our best player.How many big plays have been wiped off due to penalties and then we cant convert and we bring the defense right back out. Yesterday they were on the field for almost the entire second quarter granted due to scoring plays by ST  D. Add the run plays that Washington was using and we got worn down the exact same way we did last year.Clean up the back breaking penalties and then see where we are I guarantee it looks like an entirely different team.

9459147,0,t1_d9ezfff,Idk about that. Dak has been consistently as good or better than Wentz all season. Wentz got the better of Dak tonight though.

9459172,0,t1_d9ey782,Dak was not better than Wentz today. Some of those throws were outright horrific. Ill give him props for getting out of the pocket and extending the play a few times but his first td was all dez and that second one was a gimme due to our safeties colliding. He threw a pick in the end zone and if mckelvin had hands he would have thrown  picks in the redzone. To be perfectly honest I think Jim schrawtz exposed dak today. If he has to play a team like Seattle Minnesota or Denver who have corners that can cover  on  while sending the blitz Dallas has no chance.,eagles,d9f0mor,1,t5_2qi5w

In addition even if they are open there is no guarantee this corp is going to catch the ball. He has to call these little passes because he forced into it by extenuating circumstances. Yeah he did make some mistakes but its only his th regular season game as a head coach. You have to remember this is a rebuild year.

Everybody on that team knew that Nelson has been costing us dearly as of late and its insulting to keep rolling a guy out there who continues to underperform despite his detriment to the team. This I believe  is the best move for Nelson and for the Eagles. Lets Nelson get some perspective. Lets us see PT without a huge snap count limitation. Shows the team there is accountability. And shows us the character of Agholor. Does he sit on the bench and sulk? Does he sit in on the WR bench while the defense is on the field helping his coaches and teammates with execution.

We have  deep field threats we abandoned the run game and Doug called an AWFUL game. Carson didnt amaze but he wasnt the reason for our loss.

Him playing early was a real treat for us. Yeah the team hasnt had its best year but its in the middle of an identity switch. From chips team of quick to Dougs methodical drives. Im not worried about the future of the team because this is the nfl and it changes so much year in and year out.Im more of a Vikings fan myself but in all honesty Ive had so much more fun watching the eagles play.

A moment that really stood out to me was when Wentz seemed woozy and off he put his hand on Jason Peters chest and leaned into him and Peters immediately caught him and accepted him against his chest then put his arm around him and helped guide Wentz off the field. He could tell Wentz was off and put Wentzs well being above the game and even above the win. It stood out to me and really showed that these guys truly care for one another. I love being a part of this fan base and rooting for such a great organization. This team defied all expectations this seasons and we can only get better from here. Through injuries suspensions and rookie growing pains we still kept almost every game close. The next few seasons I can really see this team wrecking a lot of havoc and the league should definitely watch out for these Philadelphia Eagles. This a new Era for us and the league will learn to recognize us as a true threat. In Wentz we trust,eagles,dbj9v88,30,t5_2qi5w

It will be interesting to see Kap next year if his arm is fully recovered from the surgeries.  He could be a comeback player in the last game he looked really good.Run blocking was not even good but they had talent at RB which made the run work for them.The offensive plays were really interesting this year some of the most beautiful pass plays Ive seen drawn up.  Pretty much  of passes were dropped or inaccurate throws to wide open receivers.  I hope to see Chip and Curtis Modkins get chances elsewhere.Chip Kelly with the Jags is intriguing because of that talented wide receiver group.  Chip has said hes a run first guy but IDK.  His success came with throwing the ball.  I also think Chip took criticism too much to heart and stopped doing what he did so well with playing fast and throwing the ball.It was obvious that Chip also had no power in that organization.  Buckner was the only guy conditioned to Chips usual levels.  He was obviously experimenting with being a players coach.,eagles,dckb16d,3,t5_2qi5w

My now wifes first game. I told her we must leave the house by AM. She wanted to kill me. I told her its worth it and she had no choice. The boys and I are setup in the lot at about am for the pm game. We had kabobs ribs pasta salad two bottles of liquor and a case and a half of beer.  of us total we left to go into the game with only a beer each for after the game. Shared everything. Two older fellows were sitting two cars away with their WaWa hoagies. My boys would have none of it. We gave them both plates full of ribs kabobs pasta and alcohol along with it. It made their fucking day they gave us all a cigar and it made our fucking day. We had shots with all the neighbors and passer byers as well.

11168200,0,t1_dexuvx8,Hes a good man corner which is what Jim Schwartz runs for more often than zone.  Humphrey is a better zone corner which is why I think Conley is a better fit.  Also Humphrey got burned deep quite a bit in college and there is a history of Alabama corners busting since they teach them to shuffle as opposed to back paddle.  In addition Humphrey often opens up left or right too early and that opens him up for being beaten on double moves. Hes also a more complete corner than Lattimore although Lattimore is a crazy athlete.  If Lattimore falls past the Titans I would trade up for him if the price was right.  I would swap our st rd picks and give them  of our ths.  If they wanted Kendricks by some miraclehe doesnt have much trade value Id give him too.  Our picks our too valuable to give more than that imo since this draft is so deep and we have so many holes.

Those were his yardage totals from the other fucking division games last season.   So if you want to say his best games come in the division you have to look at the shitty games hes had there as well. Would I rather a player have consistent production or be really good at the end of the year?  Um...well considering about  of our games were decided by a TD or less yea Id actually rather Ertz be consistent in all of his games rather than post a meaningless  yards in a fucking loss to Washington when we needed a win. OJ Howard would push Ertz to be better and we could have two elite tight ends or at least OJ balls out and we move on from Ertz because we have the ability to do so with Howard as a replacement and use the money we are paying Ertz for something else.  I like Ertz and believe he can be good but he hasnt proven to me that I dont need a tight end for the majority of the season. ,eagles,dfts1vv,0,t5_2qi5w

Still cant even beat a jam as evidenced by that conversion attempt against Baltimore. I feel like his presence clogging up the slot is more of a hindrance than an actual help to the offense. And it seems certain in my opinion that the team wont pay him nearly what the market will.  Assuming he at least gets Sanus contract. His numbers are too inflated from Chips gimmick offense.

11775522,0,t3_680705,Unsurprising considering no player was consistently mocked more to the Eagles than Barnett.Unloading it for a bit people may not like the comparison however I feel the Eagles are trying to do on the defensive line what the Cowboys did on their offensive line. The NFC East features arguably the two best olines in the league with Dallas and Washington which they were  against last year. Consider the only win came as the Dallas sat its starters as well.Graham Curry Cox Jernigan Long and now Barnett along the line is potentially terrifying. It gives them a single defensive unit that no other team in the division can match up to on paper and potentially negates those strong aforementioned offensive lines.This team had  sacks in its last  games last season. In that span the team went  with  of those sacks coming in that final aforementioned game. The Eagles had  games last year in which they tallied two sacks or less in which the team went . In games that they managed  or more sacks they were .,eagles,dgushmr,9,t5_2qi5w

11779825,0,t1_dgv9zh5,The fact that cook made it this far makes me absolutely excited. This means that it is highly likely mixon falls to us in the nd. I could see GB going cook TBH.

11780702,0,t1_dgva8ho,I agree with you about Barnett not being a bust and the Mixon viewpoint.  Its just as hard for drs and experts to be clairvoyant about potential injuries as the fans to predict a players potential at the NFL level.  I hope Barnett works out and doesnt take as long as graham did to develop  I just have a bad taste in my mouth after Marcus Smith.  A lot of picks still left to fill some holes.  Were all in agreement that CB has to be addressed.  Wouldve loved a long term weapon for Carson too.  Hopefully they get a WR early in ..,eagles,dgvdpc1,1,t5_2qi5w

Lattimore fell to NO which allowed Barnett to slide a little more. He was on the short list of players Id be really happy with and I didnt expect him to be there so Im very glad he was. ,eagles,dgvjhkh,3,t5_2qi5w
