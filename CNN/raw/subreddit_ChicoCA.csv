91535,0,t1_ceouj6d,Yeah... Heres what was just posted..gt Our beloved Cody was placed by someone in our backyard sometime in the night or early am hours. Our yard was searched in detail the day of his disaperance Cody was not in our yard. Callie his sister for the first time since he was taken Callie sensed something in the opposite side of our yard my husband followed her and opened the gate to find Codys body. This sick person obviously wanted the heat off. Thank you for trying so hard everyone to find our Cody. We must now find this cruel person in honor of Cody and to protect other familys. My friend from Enloe Home Care just called and told me her dog was taken from their backyard this am. The dog fought back and ran back to his owner the owner chased down this man and saw him driving away in a white van. We must stop him!Please keep a look out for the van so there can at least be some justice to the story..,ChicoCA,ceoumhv,3,t5_2rqry

I dont have Triple Play internettv but Id expect the experience to be similar. Their office is on the North Side of town on Eaton next to the freeway.Edited for clarity,ChicoCA,co2sfd5,1,t5_2rqry

4892925,0,t1_cub9puo,Has there ever been a case where someone was shot to death when putting a gun into a lockbox?You splitting hairs on an issue thats cut and dry. Cops are trained to use discretion when shooting their firearm. They dont just go around shooting people who are legally handling a gun. They shoot when someone  is using the gun to hurt someone or at least theyre supposed to.I agree that cops should have more accountability but saying they shouldnt shoot someone who is pulling a weapon with obvious intent to fire it at them is fucking stupid and you know it is too.,ChicoCA,cubaj95,1,t5_2rqry

Some days Ill walk in there and hes in a good mood and super helpful other days hes in a bad mood and is downright rude. Youre  correct he might agree to host a game night then kick you guys out or not invite you back because you arent spending enough money or someone else comes along who is spending more. Its a shame because his store is actually really nice and the location cant be beat. Yet I still try to avoid shopping there. ,ChicoCA,cv2h82e,2,t5_2rqry

5766179,0,t1_cxbt2bn,gt So theres the answer Chico has not gotten more dangerous the opposite in fact but were getting left behind by most of the country.Sounds about right. Id expect a town like Chico to be trailing simply because its a college town. The only thing Id say stands out is vehicle theft being down and thats probably due more to cars having electronic ignition systems rather than something you can hotwire and those cars are just now making their way into the hands of college students as handmedowns.,ChicoCA,cxbuit9,1,t5_2rqry

11291305,0,t3_615357,Lots of options for that kind of stuff in town. For food service try Thomas Cuisine.. They are the food staff for the Enloe. For the rest you can try Community Housing Improvement they have resident manager jobs open sometimes. Anderson associates is hiring alot of people for Smuckers right now too. I know that C.A.R.D has hired a few park laborers recently as well. Kinda alot of random places but just wanted to give you a few places I know of to try out. And one more... Propacific is always hiring as well. ,ChicoCA,dfbuq0t,6,t5_2rqry
