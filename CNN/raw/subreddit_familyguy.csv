277416,0,t1_cf9hksp,Season  Episode  I think.Just watched it a little bit ago wasnt really paying attention seen the entirety of Family Guy a billion times though. If youve seen it just dont remember..Season  Episode  Spoilers Stewie accidentally makes a copy of himself implied to be the epitome of his evil. Typical OMG which one is which? in a park during a scuffle Brian kills the wrong Stewie highlighted by the fact that Stewies eyes take on a seriously demonic tone as theyre walking away.Future episodes dont support this distinction and no mention of it has been made since but its what I was talking about above for my second idea for an episode. There are other instances where character swaps like this has occurred though its a pretty unimportant fact overall things proceed as normal. ,familyguy,cf9im7o,0,t5_2quz8

1549383,0,t3_2byrtl,     Watch it all and then watch it again!! Then rewatch it again after about a year or so. Then youre gonna wanna watch it again naturally. This is because youre going to learn so much about the dynamics of each even recurring characters and the storyline itself yes the storyline!!     Im on my rd time watching it and on season  right now. Im deff gonna watch it again but this time pausing each episode on each joke just so I understand the full reference. In the newer seasons theres so many jokes that are only understood if you had knowledge of the older seasons. Slight Spoiler Alert!!!...... You kinda understand how Meg is not the only character with all the flaws. Each character has a certain flaw in them that they just cant ever get rid of and are always picked on by other people because of it. PS. If you get Family Guy and intern get Seth MacFarlanes and the humor of the writers he works with then you will find Million Ways to Die In The West to be a pretty decent comedy. PPS.
