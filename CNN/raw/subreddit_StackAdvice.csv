56821,0,t1_cekhav5,For the specific differences between g I do not know! Excess peripheral serotonin isnt a good thing that can be damaging to the heart. You can try tryptophanrich foods one example I can think of is cashews I only know because I eat a lot of them honestly!.Have you ever heard of Nacetylserotonin? Its a metabolite of serotonin intermediate between serotonin and melatonin. As well as causing drowsiness it acts as a potent agonist at the TrkB receptor  thats a type of BDNF receptor  and its thought that this is a likely way in which antidepressants are effective. But note that its only produced in darkness. Perhaps dark therapy might be a good idea.Ive shared this guy here before but I think its relevant to your cause since serotonin is a precursor to normelatonin and melatonin. How to increase serotonin in the human brain without drugsAntihistamines seem to increase slowwave sleep at least in rats albeit not consistently. Induction of prolonged continuous slowwave sleep by blocking cerebral H histamine receptors in rats Might be worth your while researching a potent relatively pure antihistamine. Closest one I think think of is mirtazapine at .mg. At that low dose its unlikely to strongly affect receptors besides histamine H.,StackAdvice,cekwdu3,1,t5_2ttk1

697268,0,t1_cgjii1j,Yes and I believe that in combination with fish oil and choline really helped me out of a depression period and overall within a few weeks it felt as if whole portions of my life came back to me. As if everything I tried to erase with alcohol came back to me. Some are claiming there are no memory benefits with piracetam however I feel differently about that.There is a growing body of evidence indicating that chronic alcohol consumption induces morphological changes in the central nervous system CNS similar to those observed during brain senescence including an increased formation of lipofuscin.Piracetam was found to markedly decrease the formation of neuronal lipofuscin. Whatever the functional implications of this pigment its reduction in piracetamtreated animals might be related either to a protective effect on the intraneuronal membranous system or to an antioxidant property of this molecule.So whatever that means. I could probably try and slap together some information on lipofuscin being related to memory decline or something however the material is over my head and I am no doctor either.I wouldnt attack dose though and Id follow normal therapeutic doses such as the doses that are administered in pills.In terms of nerve damage. I once read someone claiming it reversing hearing loss and they claimed it was due to the reformation or growth of nerve cells however I cant verify that. I can only say some people use the stuff as a treatment with hearing loss and tinnitus.gt Perhaps the depression and anxiety that accompany cessation have their part to play in the brain fog...My first time doing it I saw a visual fog and that was attack dosing I found the entire experience unpleasant. No recreation value and I spent the next few days more depressed than when I began. I threw the stuff out. Since then years later Ive followed standard therapeutic doses. However Ive never felt cloudy from piracetam. Rather the opposite a razor sharpness if you will. Now effects seem limited at being increased acuity in my visual field and maybe some verbal fluency. The initial memory effects are now a part of me so I dont really notice memory improvements anymore.,StackAdvice,cgjj5g5,1,t5_2ttk1
703346,0,t1_cgjr3qq,Im not sure what dose my melatonin or valerian root tablets are but they do seem to work well as does the CycloRem powder I am using. I dont often need to use anything to get to sleep as I usually sleep well enough. I only use sleep supplements when it is the once every  month busy week where I work long hours very busy and take most of my nootropics. In the busy week I am usually a bit wired from the hectic day and complex nootropics stack. It is at this time when I am after a bit of something extra not to help me sleep but to make the most of the  hours I get to sleep. A few article say that Huperzine A increases the amount of REM sleep so I can get by with less total sleep time for a few days in my busy week away. I have not taken Huperzine yet but had intended to take some after late morning tea and some before bed. As I will only be needing the better QUALITY sleep a few days every  months Phenibut wouldnt harm too much. If it only helps to get to sleep and doesnt help sleep quality then I dont have any need for it. ,StackAdvice,cgk81i2,1,t5_2ttk1

2098663,0,t3_2ivx6c,Try supplementing with Vitamin D with your largest meal of the day preferably with a large amount of fat. It will assist in the metabolism of serotonin in your brain and prevent peripheral buildup of serotonin which causes inflammation and overall for me discomfort. I have been having issues with sleep and I have finally narrowed it down to the fact that if I dont get enough vitamin D my sleep seriously suffers.

CDPCholine raises uridine which theoretically pairs well with fish oil and bacopa.  Alpha GPC has its own different possible benefits.  Bitartrate looks like the least promising as a cognitive enhancer.I wouldnt worry about any noopeptracetam choline combination.  Its never really been supported in the literature.

4436354,0,t3_3brfly,The general rule with any stack is always base it off of maximizing the performance of the strongest drug you are using. In this case that would be Adderall.First off keep the Adderall dosage as low as you can and avoid taking in any vitamin C or caffeine during the day. I find that taurine is best for mediating the jitters of an amphetamine high I presume thats what the Ltheanine is for?. To help nullify the adderall and improve sleep quality take g vitamin C and mg vinpocetine in the evening. The Vitamin C is serotonergic and acidifying so it counteracts and nullifies the amphetamine in the body I think there is another dynamic to this that I dont fully understand... I know Vit C and Addy both work through the glucose transporter and Im thinking the C binds to Addy at the transporter or something...? the vinpocetine lowers dopamine which helps your boy normalize for sleep and slows tolerance development I think? Not really got hard evidence for this just common sense.I would be careful mixing racetams with amphetamines. In my experience the combination is at high risk of incurring excitotoxicity. I had success with Vyvance mg NASEMAXA g CDPcholine mg BID and pramiracetam mg BID for a good halfmonth cycle of hard cramming and feverish productivity. Im not sure how well oxiracetam would compare its been too long since I used the stuff.

Also I buy all my stuff either at PowderCity or Ceretropic Alpha GPC at Powder City other stuff from Ceretropic.For the SEMAX basically theyre just different versions of the same thing. Some people may not respond to one version or another.  SEMAX and Selank are Russian I believe.  I tried each one alone first.SEMAX the original version of the three.  Its a peptide that has to be taken as a nasal spray or subcutaneously like an insulin shot in a pinch of your belly fat.  It has given me a slight stimulant effect and has helped me keep my focus. It lasts about  hours or so.The first time I tried it I took WAY too much on accident mg between  and  times the recommended amount. I got a bit of a headache but otherwise I was fine. Today I took mcg with mcg of Selank. I still feel pretty clearheaded and have had classes for a lot of the day Thermodynamics and Physics and I wasnt lost for my classes so that was nice.  I can also say when I took the mg it lasted damn near exactly  hours.  It was like at the . hour mark it just stopped.  I think it was noticeable because I took so much.NAcetyl SEMAX supposedly a stronger version of SEMAX.  I didnt feel it at all though.NA SEMAX Amidate I might have spelled it wrong Supposedly the most potent SEMAX version.  It was too much for me at I think mcg. It actually kind of gave me anxiety. Ill try again but with less and I think that will help out.Selank I actually loved Selank. It has an anxiolytic effect that gives me a bit of a mood boost. I got this one mostly because people say it pairs well with SEMAX and so far Id say it does.  I wasnt studying or anything the first time I took it so I cant say I noticed a nootropic effect.So far I have to say I like regular SEMAX and Selank the best of the new peptides I tried.

My stack largely is oriented towards improving abstract and visualspatial reasoning so this list might help.Adrafinil Aniracetam Caffeine  LTheanine Centrophenoxine Oxiracetam Noopept Phenylpiracetam and Teacrine.However what I would call my base stack does not include the Caffeine  LTheanine or the Teacrine. Ive added those more recently after the others but dont know yet if Ill keep them in my stack. In my understanding those two noots are the more naturalistic noots in my stack and so a lot of the newer members of the noot community decide to start with those and gradually work up towards the more syntheticexperimentalinvestigational noots. Some like a few friends of mine opt to stay with these kinds of noots citing some concerns over perceived risk. I personally dont mind any of the risk factors I havent encountered any noticeable issues but if you also share these concerns I think you might want to start out gradually with the natural noots first. Even though I dont think there is any base for concern around taking the more synthetic noots you are theoretically more liable to psych yourself out and have a negative placebo effects. So if you are currently in this headspace Id suggest starting off slow so you dont trick your own brainmind into magnifying any bad sideeffects. The placebo effect as you know can be incredibly powerful so even if there is absolutely nothing there the expectation that something bad will happen itself will bias your experience.This is most of the stack I am currently using and Nootropics Depot is a great place to get these from.

8123280,0,t3_4ifbkg,My advice is to scrap your current stack. The following stack is much simpler and if dopamine and the opioidergic system and saftey with brintellix are your only concerns it should meet your needs.CDPcholine to upregulate dopamine receptors and act as a choline source. If you are on a budget taking uridine monophosphate and choline bitartrate together will result in creation of small amounts of CDP choline in vivo.Bromantane to upregulate dopamine synthesis and associated enzymes. be careful as this may also slightly elevate your serotonin levels. if you notice any signs of serotonin syndrome discontinue immediately. PPAP I would recommend BPAP but it is contraindicated if you are taking an SSRI. this is a weaker but significant release potentiator of Dopamine and Norepinephrine it is not a direct releasing agent like amphetamine or anything.DLPhenylalanine to inhibit enkephalinase helps with your endogenous opioid problem and as a precursor to dopamineTianeptine to increase BDNF and improve your mood. it is an opioidergic antidepressant. be careful not to escalate your dose as this may be particularly addictive to you given your history. its nowhere near as good as hydrocodone but ultrahigh doses can get you fairly highYour current stack should not be combined with vortioxetine. the HTP can precipitate serotonin syndrome which could result in hospitalization. vortioxetine is primarily an SSRI other effects such as its mixed agonismantagonism of serotonin receptors are very minor in comparison to inhibition of SERT. ,StackAdvice,d4t4o7y,1,t5_2ttk1

10328748,0,t3_5nmgdn,Taking HTP alone will deplete catecholamine precursors. This will lead to an overall decrease in dopamine which is related to both depression and anxiety. You do supplement with tyrosine so finding the right balance would be crucial. Bvitamins can induce anxiety especially at higher doses. Other vitamins and supplements in those supplements seem unnecessary unless you are malnutritioned.But again on HTPAs over  of serotonin receptors exist outside of the brain supplementing HTP might lead to some weird side effects. Muscle aches are not a good sign This includes the heart stuff which youve prepared for with EGCG but also other parts of the body that will unintentionally get hit with serotonin as a consequence. I wouldnt use it for a long time and bear in mind you also have to stop HTP supplementation before pharmaceuticals because of the risk of serotonin syndrome. High Dvitamin intake is also related to depression. Also taking tyrosine with LDX can lead to unknown effects Id be wary of using tyrosine with a dopamine releasing agent like LDX. Taurine is gabaergic and while it may alleviate anxiety it might also depress you. You are taking quite a higher dose of melatonin which is also a depressant that may affect you negatively the next day. I know it does for me at mg at least.Edit Just remembered a major thing NAC will suppress the dopamine release from LDX or any other amphetamine which is something to consider.
