725535,0,t3_224fwv,Up at Michigan Tech we do not allow anything other than socks. The sock must be released from the hand and in the air to count as a stun. It does change some elements of the game. I my opinion it makes the game a lot more skill based on both sides. You need to be more careful when you throw your socks and zombies have a better chance of dodging. As a result the combat gets closer than with blasters. The main place you are going to see changes is in the missions you need to plan them out differently. From my experience creating missions we never have had a really enjoyable last stand mission and we have tried many variations on the rules to make them work. There are many reasons as to why that I can explain if you want. The most successful style mission is the gather x items but you want the groups to split into smaller groups. Once again I can explain if you want. From the day to day game it really does not change much but if you are on a large campus I could see problems of never dealing with the large zombie hordes since you only have a few socks on you. I wouldnt allow anything other than a sock attached to the socks. It can create problems and retreiving socks should be a part of the sportsmanship in the game.

1581327,0,t3_2cdshe,Id say focus on reach above all else maybe build a boffer greatsword or even a spearlike boffer and go with either a kite shield for flexibility or a tower shield for pure defense if at all possible.Either use a twohanded long melee like the aforementioned boffer greatsword and maintain a bubble around you since greatswords suffer in confined spaces or in situations where youre being overwhelmed.A spearpolearm and shield combo would be amazing in the reach department beating out the greatlongsword but suffering in flexibility and requiring even more of a bubble.I stress the idea of reach however since reach is the one thing the zombie players dont have. They can move just as quickly as you and since you want to challenge them in melee range going in with a shortsword such as the one currently in the zombiestrike line or some kind of an axe would be disadvantageous since that would force you to be in tagging range. A twohanded sword or a polearm would allow you to keep zombie players at longer than an arms length away giving you an enormous advantage.Hope I helped!,humansvszombies,cjehzjo,3,t5_2s3sv

If a human gets tagged they were too slowbadly positionedmade a bad decisiongot caught and were tagged for it. Zombieism should be the inevitable expected end result for all humans. Only the smart skilled lucky or some combination thereof MIGHT survive. Its the zombie apocalypse not the zombie inconvenience.,humansvszombies,cy2jc6a,7,t5_2s3sv

6072881,0,t3_3yq6if,I would rather like it if the calendar pulled frompushed to a google calendar. The actual embed doesnt have to be a google calendar but Id like to have the actual dates stored in a google calendar or at least a google calendar thats automatically updated from the subreddit games calendar. Im loving the first discussion thread and more footage of games is always a good thing. edit Also to repeat getting some of rnerfs prominent HvZers not going to name any names but I can think of... four people who are active in rnerf that are also big into HvZ to be active here would be good. I agree that too much promotion in rnerf is likely to have a detrimental effect but I feel like there IS a lot of community overlap. The weekly discussions and wiki should probably be linked to from the HvZ website and prominently. If this is intended to be the future place of discussion for the HvZ community thats really important. I understand there are probably issues with endorsing an offsite forum not under central control but HvZ really lacks ANY sort of central control so that shouldnt be a big issue. Linking to the discussions from Facebook and discouragingnot encouraging parallel discussions ON Facebook is also important. If parallel discussions get running on Facebook this subreddit is losing potential members.,humansvszombies,cyfn44v,3,t5_2s3sv
6086413,0,t1_cyh9jv9,I agree with pretty much everything you said except I have an addendum to the players testing limits thing. Players testing the limits of mission parameters and coming up with a way to get around an obstacle I never thought of is great. I love when they do that and sometimes I leave in little loopholes with the hopes they notice and use them. Testing rules limits on the other hand is BAD. Its amazing how many people dont understand that dont be a dick means that if you need to ask if something youre doing is alright means that it probably isnt. Way too many players in Athens try to game the system and dive as far into that grey area as they can.,humansvszombies,cyheot9,4,t5_2s3sv
6294162,0,t3_3y17ur,My current loadout   Primary  slinged pyragon torsion upgrade filed town mag release levers improved mag retention spring most locks removed   Secondary  Sweet Revenge basic mods   Equipment belt  a loop for a carbiner clip  vortex mag clips revenge holster and a dump pouch full of disks     I dont understand the lack of vortexNitrons Pyragons Lumitrons praxies in hvz I have never had my pyragon jam on me EVERI did had issues loading mags but was corrected by slightly trimming the disk retention clips which is invaluable in such a high stress game. With its high rate of fire you can let loose a slow moving cloud of disks that slows down hoards better than darts that quickly drop to the ground. At close to mid range they dominate especially if you keep it in perpetual half prime and slamfire single disks.,humansvszombies,cz52pqm,1,t5_2s3sv
6372822,0,t1_czdz9mu,I have never done an indoor HvZ game.  I pushed really hard to have an indoor mission but it got shut down.  I can theorize on indoor play and I believe that Modern MOUT training should be very effective in a lot of it.  Building clearing is practiced quite a bit in my current military MOS but I am afraid that it wont transfer over exactly because we lack the same resources i.e. flash grenades as well as having a different enemy type.  In the army you train on Limitless Range weapon systems against Limitless Range weapon systems.  In HvZ your weapons are only accurate for about  feet and you are fighting against an enemy that lacks unless there are specified exceptions range and requires on getting close.  You also have to worry about the effect of unintentional body blocking which is something that you dont have to worry about with traditional weapon systems.  Look up MOUT training on youtube and try to translate some of the training to your own group but be aware of the challenges and differences that I listed above.  The biggest change that I would make is that MOUT focuses on violence of action and charging through the Fatal Funnels Doorways quickly however that speed doesnt seem necessary on first thoughts.  Open a door then slowly pie the area with supporting cover.  Create as much reactionary space as possible.  Crossing Intersections can actually be done with the Rolling T formation very effectively.  Warning of caution though  Anything that involves the High Low method is not going to be good for HvZ.  It is a pop out tactic for corners but you willingly give up your reactionary space which is stupid in pretty much every situation.  Another tactic that may be something to consider would be using a serpentine method of travel.  The main problem with it in a military aspect is that you have the risk of many weapon muzzles pointed in a direction of your buddies which is obviously very bad in a firearm weapon.  However for HvZ that isnt a big deal.  I cant find a single video on youtube about it so I will just expand on it more for you later.  Having a group in the size that I run seems to not be much of an advantage in a tight quarter game like yours.  Unless you split the groups up then you will just cause a very cramped up hallway.  Splitting the groups and doing different objectives is what Part  will be about so that could be useful for your game type if that is what your intention is.  I hope this helps expand on some things that you were wondering about.  Thanks!  Edit  Just an addendum.  If you are looking at videos over these sorts of tactics think of the reasons as to why they are doing the tactics that they are doing not just the how.  If the reason why they burst through the door is to avoid fire coming at them then the tactic should be altered.  If the reason why they position themselves right next to the corner is to give themselves a smaller silhouette for someone to shoot at it doesnt apply and should be altered.  The element of surprise and violence of action are great things and we will use them extensively later however when you do so in close quarters you will lose your reactionary space.  ,humansvszombies,cze0pwn,1,t5_2s3sv

6802236,0,t3_48t6k8,Oregon State has done a few variations on invulnerable zombies. The most recent is a zombie with a cape. They cant tag but are invulnerable while calling out a countdown and holding the cape open. Lets the zombies set up cover in open fields. We have also done a mobile respawn with flags to be pulled to be destroyed. Letting it tag and respawn itself was a mistake that lives in infamy. Other takes have been armor and shields. The armor is highly visable and makes a zombie immune to either darts or socks. Shields are very well padded and simply can be used to block darts. Two tall shields make for reasonably panicked humans and a confident lot of zombies. Any of these have been powered down if needed by instructing the specials that they arent allowed to run.,humansvszombies,d0nbrg5,1,t5_2s3sv

8768373,0,t3_5055sf,Weve kept them out of our games for safety concerns. Ive personally seen them used without injury but wed hate to have that one day where someone messes up. One day a player managed to make it to a mission with a blowgun and shot me with in the dark from over  feet away. Aside from being just a bit mad about the surprise stun I had also been hit in a soft spot on my throat and it did not feel good. Since he could barely see me Im glad he didnt get my eye instead. So its a lot easier to ban blowguns than ask all players to get eye protection just in case and to ask them to get hit with that power in potentially soft spots.Those are our official reasons. Off the record I dont think anyone should ever even need to stun a zombie at that range anyway but thats just a biased opinion.,humansvszombies,d71pl85,3,t5_2s3sv
8841038,0,t3_51609v,Honestly a game where I was forced to play only with  shots showed me that I dont really care for more than just a primary and more mags. I hardly ever use a secondary any more. This is great advice for those looking to get lighter. ,humansvszombies,d7akfot,2,t5_2s3sv
11108842,0,t1_deqtjb2,I think that the transparency is important. Our point distribution didnt feel equal since humans only really got points for missions. Other than the mission they forfeited they got almost as many as zombies. Ill need to find a way to get them more opportunities.Im going to stay away from inflation too.
