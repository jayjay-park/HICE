6464848,0,t3_446nhq,Get the best damage gear you can find in the auction house I know the level  celestia gear for myth can give you at least  damage. Train a pet with spell defy and sprite if you can the pet vendor in the celestia base camp sells a starfish for k gold it has both of those talents. And most importantly have at least two different spell decks one for boss fights and one for small fights. In your small deck have one humongofrog one earthquake two myth blades and two spirit blades and two of whatever sun damage buff spell you have. This will make fights go very fast its a race against the enemy monsters when youre starting celestia you want to one hit both of them before they can kill you. First round blade second blade third blade if you have an item that gives it or amplify or time of legend fourth attack with buffed earthquake and maybe finish with frog if they somehow survived. You will be doing about  damage to all if you have decent gear more if you have the sky iron hasta equipped use this wand because the level  wands dont give enough critical to be of use and the  is really noticeable. Also dont train ANY moon spells except possibly jaguar for being healer in a pinch  because you wont be able to use them in higher level worlds since they lower your health and resist just train the damage buff sun spells and skip the accuracy ones train fortify amplify empowerment if you want I never really used any of the three except fortify. Also if you dont have spirit blade for some reason go train it you can skip elemental bladetrap and spirit trap as you wont need them later. When you have enough training points from the many training point side quests in celestia go purchase feint from Dworgyn to be used for boss fights. I learned this all after getting murdered in celestia after I changed gear and spell deck style I DRASTICALLY improved. May also want to have another small deck just for fighting myth monsters that contains two converts in addition to normal small fight deck. The most important advice out of what I just said is the deck thing with a small deck you get what you need instantly and almost never have to discard just get  blades up or  blades and a bubble and super earthquake. Also get ring and athame that gives the best damage and pip chance there are damage boosting rings and athames at your level now. Dont worry too much about mana loss because you will only be using  mana per duel. Again damage gear dont worry about health you can switch to more tanky gear for boss fights if you have to. ,Wizard101,czo0dfg,2,t5_2su2m

6649339,0,t3_46n40j,I wouldnt say there is a worst school. Its more about the fact of What can this school do that this one cant and for myth they cant really bring a whole lot to the table. When it comes to hitting everyone would say the best school is balance. When it comes to tankinghealing everyone would say life or ice. Myth is probably the tier when it comes to well generally everything. It has its utility yes however other schools just completely outclass myth.For pvp myth isnt bad in any situation what so ever. Personally I put it in my top . Its kit is so unique where you need to develop your own playstyle for the school. Nick StormRider Level  with  rating strives to prove to people myth can compete with the best pvp schools in game. Him and Dakota Lotus Life had an insane record for vs. When you hear of a myth and life duo most people would think thats an easy win but they do great.Myth isnt the worst school they all have pros and cons however some classes just have better pros than some other classes.,Wizard101,d073kyy,1,t5_2su2m

7406432,0,t3_4eauoe,Wizard was at its peak in . Those were the years I remember having the best time where I would meet on average over ten new people a day to quest with. I was pretty obsessed with this game for a good part of my teen years mostly because it was simple to learn and play. And also the school differences intrigued me. The whole idea of it was new and exciting to me as Id never played an online MMO before. Ive met a lot of good people over the years but every time Ive returned the game declines in entertainment and replayability. I meet less people and the class differences become less defined and everything starts to feel the same. Its a very fun game for new players. It hooks you in the beginning. Once you hit ZF or heck even CL something changes and idk its just a different feel. Different adjustment process. ,Wizard101,d2k29y8,1,t5_2su2m

10412592,0,t3_5p1t7y,My Fire is  and just started Celestia! Ya still dont know how that happened. Wintertusk EXP bonus is OP I guess.ANYWAYS heres my tips on playing better especially on a Fire!. First of all I suggest doing some sidequests to get to level  so you can do Waterworks and farm that for the complete set of gear Firestarters Hat Robe and Boots. Its handsdown the best allaround gear until level  yup you read that right. Midgame in Wizard is a really awkward plateau. At the point you are a good wand is either the level  wand from Celestia or the Sky Iron Hasta  damage. Good athamering are the crafted ones from Wintertusk. Make sure you do GrizzleheimWintertusk so you can get the Fuel and Power Link spells if you dont already have those. Keep your decks small and only pack what you need for each fight. My current main deck for my Fire wizard is this      Spells  x Fireblade  x Elemental Blade  x Amplify  x Fortify  x Gargantuan  x Meteor Strike  x Fire Dragon  x Pixie.     Treasure Cards  x Satyr  x Reshuffle  x Fire Dragon     Item Cards  x Wildfire from Wintertusk Crafted boots disable wand attacks disable Helephant item card from pet Have a separate Boss Deck. Composition is pretty similar to Main Deck      Spells  x Fireblade  x Elemental Blade  x Amplify  x Fortify  x Gargantuan  x Efreet  x Fire Dragon  x Pixie  x Fuel  x Fire Trap  x Feint  x Tower Shield     Treasure Cards  x Satyr  x Rebirth  x Reshuffle  x Ember Everburn low pip highdamage TC for easy minion kill if you need that  x Fortify     Item Cards  x Wildfire from Wintertusk Crafted boots disable wand attacks disable Helephant item card from pet Training point loadout     Ice to Tower Shield  points.     Death to Feint  points.     Life to Satyr if you solo  points.     Sun damage enchants  points at . Accuracy enchants arent worth it IMO.     Amplify Fortify maybe Vengeance from Star  points. Im not a fan of Vengeance since I dont like relying on Critical but thats your call.,Wizard101,dcoc2jg,1,t5_2su2m
10418829,0,t3_5p7hjm,Firstly I doubt the KI devs check this sub. Unfortunately its common knowledge that the water elemental is the worst minion in the game.

11385213,0,t3_62g7lz,Top tier level  gear usually comes from Tartarus. But Tartarus is a long dungeon and requires many trips for good drops. Its not better than Darkmoor gear by any stretch but it should help you to last better in battles once you get to exalted and above. That is if you havent already gotten gear sets from Rattle or Krok.Avalon Crafted gear should replace your waterworks gear for the most part. Azteca crafting is a hit and miss depending on what school you are.Im ice so I only know that one of the best exalted sets if you arent going to use spells like Dark Nova is Krok Hat Rattle Robe Malistaire Boots Darkmoor Tier  Athame Morganthes AmuletAmulet of Neverwhere Malistaire Staff unless you have crowns and buy a better wand and the Ring is up to your preference. But people usually use DD Ring for PVP the crafted rings from Wozina for extra resist or the LV  ring dropped by high Olympian bosses.Everyone still uses Malistaire gear persisting to level . Unless they decide to go for the new crafted wands that feature pip conversion. The level  stuff you can get from Polaris final boss. Its not that bad actually. You can even get a ton of pets. I must have gotten  pets running Polaris. I believe he drops an amulet bolstered shield that ups resist by .My advice is grind until youre exalted. Its not worth it to grind for Promethean gear. It takes less time to get to exalted and it takes away time grinding Malistaires place. Unless you really need to be prepared for the Darkmoor battles then I can understand grinding for promethean stuff anyway.,Wizard101,dfmhtcv,1,t5_2su2m
