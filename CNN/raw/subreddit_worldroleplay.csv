Iron Dome is indeed available for purchase and a single unit  which should be more than adequate to cover the territory of Vatican City  will cost US million. Iron Dome is not the only air defence system we can offer His Holiness. We also the Davids Sling defence system a name I am sure his Holiness can appreciate that will offer protection from mediumandlong range missiles. Davids Sling is a more expensive system US  million for a unit however it offers a secondary layer of protection against more strategic uses of force. Again a single system would be more than adequate to defend Vatican City.gt Iron Dome and David Sling should be considered complimentary parts of a possibly integrated defence system. Iron Dome will protect against shortrange missile fire and Davids Sling the longer range. Each system works without the other however purchasing only one will leave holes in the air defence. gt Both these weapon systems could be built and delivered within a years time.
