4700454,0,t3_3f78o9,GRM and USA current two factions both have distinct infantry playstyles and Im sure that vehicles are going to take it to the next level. US troops cost a little bit more manpower amp control points but they fire much more accurately. On the other hand the GRM can easily outnumber and outmaneuver with their inexpensive AKspraying militiamen. The game is very balanced so far despite the infantry combat being so asymmetrical. It still completely comes down to player skill.What needs to go though are levellocked soldiers in each faction. You need to play a certain number of matches as each faction to get xp to unlock different soldiers like grenadiers for the US or snipers for GRM.,calltoarms,ctn14p8,2,t5_2smih
5978621,0,t1_cy3br4f,I actually play on medium at the moment because the game wasnt very optimised last time I played it. I run a AMD  with a Fury x. Basically the issue is if you turn the camera so you can see the horizon the frame is pretty low. If you keep the camera at the normal angle its fine and I could run in maxed out.,calltoarms,cy3btng,1,t5_2smih
