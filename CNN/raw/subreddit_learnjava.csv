11111674,0,t3_5ynpgq,Suppose you have two pets a Dog and a Cat. They are both Animals and can make sounds. Dogs can also play fetch while cats can scratch your walls.    class Dog extends Animal         public void makeSound             System.out.printlnWoof!                public void playFetch  ...         class Cat extends Animal         public void makeSound             System.out.printlnMeow...                public void scratchWall  ...     Now lets say you take out both pets and they start arguing with each other. To have all your pets make sounds you could do    ListltAnimalgt pets  new ArrayListltAnimalgt  Note the types here too    Animal dog  new Dog    Animal cat  new Cat    pets.adddog    pets.addcat    for Animal myAnimal  pets         myAnimal.makeSound    Because your dog and cat are Animals youre allowed to store them in a single ArrayList and iterate over it to call a common method. This is called polymorphism. Since theyre Animals you cannot call any classspecific methods like playFetch for dogs or scratchWall for cats on them unless you cast them since it wouldnt make sense for a dog to scratch walls or a cat to play fetch. ,learnjava,derhywc,3,t5_2saos
11235351,0,t3_60dfwj,The code for creating the array where the size is specified needs to be inside the loop. You need to create an array with a larger size each time the loop runs. Right now you are just assigning values inside the array but not changing the size at all.,learnjava,df5ifa7,5,t5_2saos

11489259,0,t3_62jgcg,I know this is kind of old and youve solved your problem but the first thing you should do when you get an exception thrown at you is check out the doc It describes your case pretty exactlygt . For example if a thread modifies a collection ArrayLists are collections directly while it is iterating over the collection with a failfast iterator the iterator will throw this exception. ,learnjava,dfyb14r,1,t5_2saos
11735048,0,t3_67g0rv,There isnt really a best way of learning anything. Its all subjective. Personally I found youtube tutorials helped me learn really well but that might not work for you or it might. I also used a book called Head first Java which was pretty decent.,learnjava,dgq748w,2,t5_2saos
