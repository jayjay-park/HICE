6752603,0,t3_46zgtt,Im still in the hunting their smaller fleets stage but Ive found a few things that work.  Ive found that I can solo a jesuit class with a sunderu tachyon lance to hurt em graviton beams to keep their flux from dropping while the lance recharges. Also never ever deploy frigates they are useless against templar.  Hunt the small fleets and salvage what you can especially clarents and rolands those horrible cheaty purple missiles,starsector,d0hrym5,1,t5_2w0he
