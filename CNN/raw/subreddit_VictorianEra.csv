382183,0,t3_1yg9i7,To echo uTextofReason here is a typical Victorian dress and here is a typical Regency dress which is what would have been worn in Austen novels.Aside from that your little description sounds nice at first but if this is a serious project that needs to be thorough then Im going to give you some thorough feedback.If I were really looking for a place to have a Victorian wedding and I came across a website with this description I would probably breeze past it and never look at it again. Its way too vague and as youve already been told some of your dates are wrong. gtA feast which is a reflection of the food...We still eat a lot of the same foods. Is it going to be a beef roast like anyone can get anywhere? Or is it going to be duck or pheasant? Is it going to be cooked on a wood stove like it would have been then? that gives it a different flavor than an electric stove. Are the recipes from the Victorian era? For couple interested in classical music it would be really cool to have musicians rather than a stereo or DJ. A small group like a string quartet. If you had musicians that played modern songs in a classical style that would be a neat way to tie traditional and modern together.Halfhour dance lessons seems really short especially if you plan to fit more than one dance into that time. Halfhour for one dance sure but I think that time would need to be lengthened if that was going to be a focal point of the party. Though the most prominent dance of the Victorian era was the waltz. The line dances which are fun were more prominent during the Regency era and were fading out by the Victorian era.With a little more research for accuracy and a little more detail I think this would be a great wedding package.,VictorianEra,cfkdmtz,5,t5_2wxmk

4634440,0,t1_ctemygu,For me it does not really matter that a particular picture is true or not what is the principle that is postmortem pictures. If we keep in mind that at that time people had no photographs of their loved one as a natural one sees the idea of these images.P.S. sorry for my possible strange english i use Google translate to help,VictorianEra,cteqnph,1,t5_2wxmk
