24526,0,t1_ceh5dym,I really like these needles. I had a set of these and set of dreamz they were made in the same factory at the time. I gave away the harmonies to another knitter when I got my Karbonz it was so cool seeing them open the case.,casualknitting,ceh8438,2,t5_2wdrw

1541760,0,t3_2bualo,I used Noro Chirimen for this Esker scarf  It took a little over one skein but it is a cotton based yarn with silk and bamboo so it has a less give. It was easy enough. You have to count the rows but the entire thing is really easy.,casualknitting,cj9j81h,2,t5_2wdrw

5325145,0,t1_cvs7e85,I would suggest switching to needles one size smaller for the ribbing. This will tighten the stitches and should stop it flaring. As ribbing is looser than stockinette doing half as many rows wont make a difference although a few less stitches per row would. Good job so far by the way looking good!,casualknitting,cvsckrz,7,t5_2wdrw

5883791,0,t3_3vsixg,................................. if youre planning on knitting up all the things for christmas imho you need to start in like april. that was the only time i was successful. that year i literally didnt knit a single thing for me. this made me sad. i should after all at least knit SOMETHING for myself. which is why no one is getting hand knit shit from me this year. nope! well one person and its for their family. because their mom died and it was her yarn. good motivation and feelings like knitting for the right reasons.maybe next year a few select people will end up with goodies.. though im planning on knitting my first sweater for me next year. so maybe not after all.,casualknitting,cxqwckh,2,t5_2wdrw
5912214,0,t1_cxul9hj,Im not too worried about it as it is a scarf so it will get bunched up and stuff during wear. Definitely not worried enough to add a border and I dont have the time silly parents requesting knitted gifts very last minute but if blocking might help that could be worth it to me.Its a pattern from knitspirations so I didnt anticipate such curling as they didnt call for a border in the pattern.,casualknitting,cxumgu0,1,t5_2wdrw

9938347,0,t3_5htr2i,The edges should be able to be fixed by blocking. Sometimes funky stitches can be blended in too but not always depending on how they are situated in the piece. just depends on your preference! It does look like youre closer to the beginning than the end and if you were at the end Id say for sure leave it. At this point you could go either way.,casualknitting,db2zpt3,6,t5_2wdrw
