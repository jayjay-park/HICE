6882734,0,t3_49x7x6,I played on many teams where the coach was a parent of a player fortunately there was never any clear favoritism the coachs kid usually got the benefit of the doubt but that was the worst of it. Most of the coaches kids i played with were the best players on the team anyway,Homeplate,d0wh2cd,2,t5_3d30v
6968062,0,t1_d15q8jt,I hated that throw although I dont think I could attribute it my yips. I played in a mens league a decade later and I made every single one. I have no explanation for it.,Homeplate,d165zg9,3,t5_3d30v

9390364,0,t3_595539,Focus on control and form. Learn to analyze your misses. If you miss left did you step that way? For a lefty if you miss right did you over rotate your plant foot?  Watch some videos of pitching and understand the mechanics of the arm. Once you start then you can make adjustments. If youre on a team then coaches and others will help. Dont worry about learning a bunch of pitches. Learn to be accurate with a curve and a fastball will suffice for most games. Im not a strike out pitcher but I dont walk anyone frequently either. I let my defense do the work and I just throw strikes. ,Homeplate,d96an4t,1,t5_3d30v
10031425,0,t3_5ja1zm,It all depends if you have access to a weight room.  Also what are your goals if you dont want to level off? And are you high school college level. I think people need more info. ,Homeplate,dbf4dyg,1,t5_3d30v
11039277,0,t1_deiw8qg,Definitely stick with real baseballs. If you can get someone to catch you have them put  markers baseballs or tennis balls or whatever across the front of the plate.  just off the plate  on the corners and  in the middle. Have them set up on these different spots on the plate and just try to hit the center of their glove every time. The smaller target you try to hit the smaller youll miss by. I always try to hit the dark spot in my catchers mitt if he has one. This drill will help you hit the corners of the zone and be able to pitch out of the zone if youre trying to get the batter to chase. The markers just help you see the spots better and the catcher to set up correctly. After that its just repetition.Using real baseballs is very important though. The slightest difference in weight or feel can throw me off. If I used a tennis ball I would probably just spike it into the ground a few times. ,Homeplate,deja6mg,1,t5_3d30v
11042757,0,t1_deji1xr,Ive been there before man. I get it. Find field or somewhere you can throw and get a bucket or trashcan. Weigh the bucket down with a sandbag or something and prop it up a little bit. Then just hammer it. You could also do this with some tape and a wall but itll tear up a ball. If you could get a weighted tennis ball or something that would be fine. Its not as much the movement as the weight of the all.All you can do to get some reps in. You dont need to throw hard at first. Just throw it  and place it well. After a while you should be able to up the ante and keep placing it where you want.,Homeplate,dejody9,1,t5_3d30v
