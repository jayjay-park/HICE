21672,0,t3_1ud6ud,This subreddit has a hardon against embassies and open borders than is way overblown. I always give embassies and trading open borders is useful for getting my scouts around. Also while you shouldnt give open borders to a tourism powerhouse or a neighbor with his eyes on your lands giving them to a civ on the other side of the map is fine if it gets your triemes around his coast. Catapults and trebuchets do just fine in their eras while they may get outclassed Ive had many games where catapults turned some early wars to my advantage. Wide empires suffer from an increased science penalty shittiest change to bnw. So if you go too wide youll find your science moving at a crawl. Those  extra cities are gonna cost you a  increase on standard map sizes. And I had  cities producing  bpt so take that advice with a grain of salt.Rationalism is a good tree but not the absolute necessity people make it out to be. Maybe on deity it is but on my last immortal game I grabbed the opener   policy and that was after I finished patronage and got my rd tier tenet. On lower difficulties you will not in fact get steamrolled by the ai unless your science is suffering in other ways.

59897,0,t3_1usko4,They are slots for great works. You probably know that you can create great works that produce tourism. You need buildings to house them and thats what the slots are for  they tell which buildings you have in which cities and allow you to move them between cities and buildings so that you can eg maximize tourism production in certain cities. The symbols tell what type of a great work a building allows that is great works of art writing or music.More importantly the bar on the left hand side shows all the wonders you have that have slots for great works. These are important because having certain combination of great works inside these buildings produces theming bonuses that is additional tourism. You can see the combination that gives the bonus by hovering above the wonder. It might require that all great works inside the building should be from the same era and different civilizations.

62864,0,t3_1utlo5,gtAre they really important? Oh my yes!gtShould you pursue a certain type of great person depending on your strategy? Sort of.  You should prioritize ones that are more important to your intended victory type this might be less true in vanilla without great prophetsmusicianswriters.  However great scientists are important in any playstyle.  The longer the game goes on the more feasible it is to start pumping out great people of all kinds.gtShould you try to devote certain cities to certain types? Generally its more like designating certain cities as great person generators usually your capitol plus some other big cities if you can mange it.  Youll want these cities to have buildingswonders that promote great person production.  Building the city on a river is a huge bonus because it unlocks the Garden which is i think a  increase to great person production.Each city accrues great person points towards each person type on a per city basis and the cost goes up each time a person is generated regardless of which city generated  it.  So if you have a little city with just one great person point per turn it might literally never spit out a great person as other more productive cities keep raising the cost before it can get there.  Therefore it could be considered wasteful to have specialists in a city if you arent fully committed to it.  HOWEVER dont forget that specialists generate additional culturescienceproduction depending on their type sot hey are not necessarily wasted even if they never generate a great person.gtBasically any and all advice you can give about actively making use of Great People would be awesome!Use great engineers to complete wonders.  Usually you can finish a fresh wonder and in just one turn using the GE.  Related tips dont start building a wonder if youre only a few turns away from generating a GE.  Work on something else and switch to building the wonder and use the GE to hurry it in one turn.  You can go back to building the original building after the one turn wonder and it wont lose any of the production youve invested in it.This tip isnt quite great person related but Im guessing from your post that you dont know much about specialist management  if you ever find yourself in a gold deficit and cant get any AIs to trade with you toss a few extra citizens into merchant specialist slots and youll instantly be generating a few more gold per turn.  Can get you through some hard times until you research and build wealth magnifier buildings like banks.,civ,cell4wo,6,t5_2rk3b

Krakow holding Solomons Mines would be able to pump out defensive units when the time comes and the abundance of forests will hinder the advance of units on the east side of the river by Warsaw.Now he can place some key archers in two spots on the hills to the south of Krakow to keep sight of the plains and on the forested hills right next to Babylon. Hell then be able to see which angle of attack Babylon will take and adjust accordingly. If Babylon attacks via the plains he can line the river with archers and pick off the attackers since they cant effectively attack over the river. If they attack from the east of the forest he can line the forest with his archers and warriors once again for the defensive bonus.If the OP plays it right there is absolutely  chance that Babylon will take a city.,civ,cewz8hp,1,t5_2rk3b

My best guesses for civs that would be more successful in such a situationPoland Free Policies.Egypt Bonus towards building wonders. Maintenancefree temple that provides  happiness.France Double theming bonuses means more culture and more tourism for culture victory.Venice Double trade routes. Very important in a situation where gold would be harder to come by. However without CityStates they are also handicapped.Rome Production bonus in cities other than capital.Babylon Still would have Great Scientists coming out the wazoo.Maya Still would have the Pyramid for making a great early faithscience start plus The Long Count would still give them extra Great People.Ethiopia Same as Maya theyd be able to get their religion up quick.A lot of this could change depending on what happened in interactions between the civs and I didnt include any of the civs that just have military advantages. It would be a lot harder to get a conquest victory though without resources. Im leaning towards Egypt having the best neutral advantage.

Or if youre playing wonderwhore venice and aiming culture victory. Again you dont NEED more than  great merchants with Venice one which comes with optics one or two you can get by using a specialist on your market and bank.

Its all about planning and thinking ahead.One of the coolest aspects of the game is diplomacy.  A lot of people think the AIs are temperamental and weird but it turns out if you pay attention theyre quite rational its just that you cant do whatever the hell you want without pissing them off.

281494,0,t3_1xbgsf,The multiplayer user interface is terrible. Users should be able to filter out servers theyre ineligible for because of DLC packs. Why the hell do I see BNW games if I dont have BNW?The back button is in a retarded location and should NOT exit you from the server. There should be a LEAVE SERVER button instead. Too many server hosts accidentally exit their server while making changes because they fail to click the top players tab and instead hit the back button. Even after I specifically warn them to not hit the back button they still do it.Players should have access to a list of recent players theyve met so they can rehost games that have crashed. Im tired of getting kicked constantly from servers that are meant to be private rehosts.Players need to be ranked like on SC. Im tired of playing against a bunch of  year olds too stupid to understand the nuances of this game. Frequent quitters need to be marked. Reliability is vital to enjoyment of this game.Vote kicking should be instituted instead of host kicking. Tired of getting kicked by server host because I stole his settlerworker andor hes about to lose.Why the fuck is it so hard for me to findrejoin a game that I dropped from due to game crashes? Tired of having to add strangers on Steam just so I can get back into a game. That fucked up trade modification bug that still hasnt been fixed since Vanilla. Why the fuck is it still there? People are too paranoid to send peace treaties now.Turn timer is a fucking joke. Why is there an infinity timer on turn ? Shouldnt it be something like  minutes? We should be able to adjust the timer scaling. Currently it only scales at a fixed rate we should be able to change that. A smart timer should be in place instead where its constantly adjusted based on the players abilities how much time theyve needed in the last few turns whether or not theyre at war if theyre choosing a religion etc. We should also be able to make changes to the timer in game.Games where a player has left and replaced by an AI should be eligible for people to join from lobby. A description of it should also be available so people can see if its a game they want to join or not.Games should NOT be paused when a player is joining. I dont see why thats necessary when the AI is available and the strategic difference of a turn is kind of negligible.Game needs to be more stable. Im running a top of the line Mac Pro and the game crashes constantly even at the lowest setting. Whoever did the porting really fucked up badly.For a turn based game the lag is terrible. SC is a RTS that has loads more info being communicated between server and host yet it does it flawlessly compared to Civ.Why the fuck does the server crash  of the time whenever a player leaves? Gameplay needs to have some semblance of balance.El Dorado? Fountain of Youth? Are you fucking serious? How is that fun for anyone? AI needs to actually have intelligence.AI currently does not know the difference between range melee and mounted units. It doesnt even know how to place them in relation to each other or how to use them correctly.Does not know when it is losing or winning. Too many times it will refuse to make peace unless I give up a city or two because it has  spearmen to my  crossbowmen.I can go on but were all clearly pissed off by the AI. It should be using better strategy instead of cheating at higher difficulty levels.,civ,cf9xut5,10,t5_2rk3b

335301,0,t3_1xvvex,Heres a reorganized copypaste of a reply I made in a similar topic.Ive logged  hours but still feel newish to the game. I learn more each time I play and each time I visit this subreddit. So grain of salt and all that.Defence Pick defendable locations for your cities near mountains and other choke points. Make it hard for your opponents to surround your city. Hard to siege it up.Cities on a hill get a defensive bonus AND an additional production. If you feel an attack coming build WallsCastles in outlying cities. AI will work their way in from the edge of your empire rather than rushing straight to your capital. I love having siege units garrisoned in my cities. Their weaknesses are lack of mobility and susceptibility to melee attacks. Being garrisoned negates both issues. Archers in the early game I completely skip Trebucher Anticipating an attack Ill setup a semi circle of road behind my soontobebesiegedcities. This will let me get several ranged units behind the protection of the city while still being in range of enemy front line melee units. The roads also let your siege weapons move setup AND fire in the same turn. This is a gigantic advantage. Against huge attacks these units can soak an attack or two each keeping my city up that much longer. Rotate really wounded lt hp units back to a safe spot to heal up. Dont lose them unless you have to. Remember that your reinforcements spawn nearby while theirs have to travel from their empire. Hit and run. Swing in from the siderear with a mounted unit to knock out enemy ranged units and retreat away before melee especially pikemen fight back. Science Find key researches that are central to your victory. Plan  techs ahead for them. Get those essential techs first and grab the nicetohave ones later when theyre relatively cheaper. If you find a jungleheavy area you can set it up to be a big science city especially if its next to a mountain too. Trading Post the jungle tiles so that the jungle isnt removed. Its a shortterm food sacrifice for a longterm science payoff. The adjacent mountain lets you build an Observatory for extra science. If I get this city up in time my National College goes here. Need population growth? Riverlake cities? Civil Service is unreal fresh water farm boost plus pikemen and a popular wonder. Keep track of which ages your opponents are in. I jot it down on a notepad so I can see the order in which each Civ advanced and which turn it was. Is the same civ the first one each era? Maybe he needs to be knocked around a bit so he cant concentrate so hard on science.Wonders Science Certain Wonders are very popular. You can rush to them quickly so that you get a headstart on them. If youre really ahead it finished before anyone else starts  which is awesome. Otherwise you might frustrate other Civs that were also building them. You could avoid the wonder and let someone else get it. Dont be in the middle though or else it may be you whos  to  done when someone else finishes it. If you are the first Civ into a new era you have a great advantage. At that moment you are guaranteed that no other Civ has started any of the wonders units buildings resources and tile improvements of that age. Knowing the absolute earliest an opponent couldve started a wonder is important. I also jot down when Wonders are built. I know to ignore that Wonder in the tech tree when planning my research. Otherwise its easy to forget that Machu Picchu was built  turns ago by someone far away. I research the tech only to rediscover that its already been built!Culture Science For a Cultural Victory get Radio Eiffiel Tower wonder next culture building.Attack Science Want to attack someone soon? Setup a timing attack! Before the new unit tech is ready either a have a bunch of the earlier unit built AND a small stockpile of gold to  upgrade them when it finishes or b have your cities finishing up productionready to do a round of units when the research completes. Examples of strong Tech Units aregt  Rifling Riflemangt  Dynamite Artillerygt  Flight Great War Bombergt  Refrigeration Submarinegt  Plastics InfantryCultural Which policies you take should be directly correlated to how you plan on playing.Tradition for Tall Empires few cities high pop and Liberty for Wide Empires many cities smaller population per city.gt  Honor is vital for Domination Victory.gt  Piety has good synergy with a lot of strategies.

The sooner you get your religion up the more options you have to pick from and the sooner you can start spreading.gt  Patronage is mandatory for Diplomatic Victory.gt  Aesthetics is vital for Cultural Victory.gt  Commerce is for general quality of life boosts your economy happiness and Great Merchants.gt  Exploration is for naval military units and seabased economy. Full tree unlock is bonus Antiquity sites for Cultural Victory. gt  Rationalism is mandatory for Science Victories and helpful for most other strategies. Figure out what youre going to do with your Faith points once you reach the industrial age. Certain Units Structures and Great Persons become purchasable via Religion choices and Social policy tree unlocks.Ideologygt  Autocracy  Cultural Diplomatic Domination  NOT Sciencegt  Autocracy  Aggressive military.gt  Freedom  Cultural Diplomatic Scientific  NOT Dominationgt  Freedom  Small Tall and Medium empires. Specialists and Great People.gt  Order  Cultural Domination Scientific  NOT Diplomaticgt  Order  Large Wide empires.  If youre early to the party you get two free Tenets  to a social policy in your newly adopted ideology. Consider what your  tech rivals are going to pick using the above info. After a few Civs have picked Ideologies the rest of the Civs will start favouring the more popular ones. Unpopular Ideologies can receive up to  happiness. If yours is popular your opponents are punished for choosing differently. If yours is unpopular build up extra happiness to offset the unhappiness. I avoid switching Ideologies you lose too many tenet bonuses.AttackDomination Your Civs special units are stronger than the generic units of that age so take advantage of them. Great Generals project a  combat strength buff in a tile radius. You can attack with some of your units in the radius then move the general near the rest of your units before attacking with them.Diplomacy The most important part of the game is the interleader diplomacy. You need to strive not to piss people off. Its hard. I love capturingfreeing other players noncombat units from Barbarians. If you return the unit you get a small but permanent diplomacy boost with that Civ. If its owned by a CityState the reward is a onetime  influence. Early the worker can be very helpful whereas the  influence is great in the mid and late game if I want to compete for that CityStates favour. Captured Settlers that are not returned to their owner become Workers for you  Periodically check Global Politics in the civ diplomacy tab. Who denounced whom? Who declared friendship with whom? In the trade window you can ask another Civ to declare war on someone in exchange for your resourcesgoldetc. There generally has to be animosity between them though. Your hands stay clean while they get the warmonger penalties. Ive learned to only denounce someone when they are really hated by everyone else. Dont make the other Civs pick sides they often wont side with you! Here are some things that piss Civs off. Do this stuff too much and you can get caught in a spiral of denounces and everyone being guarded against you. Its hard to break the cycle.gt  Demand they not settle near you.gt  Demand they stop spying.gt  Demand they stop spreading their religion.gt  Buy titles near them until they confront you and then a tell them you do what you want or b say youll stop but then keep buyinggt  Win over their allied CityStates.gt  Steal their land with a Great General.gt  Propose a UN Resolution they dont like. The hover tooltip shows you which Civs will be GratefulAngry for each resolution before you commit your pick.gt  Declaring war on them or their FriendsProtected CityStates.gt  Warmonger penalty for capturing anyones city. Reduced if they dislike the owner of the city you conquered. Enemy cities have a tooltip that says how bad the penalty will be. Cumulative over recent conquests but dissipates over time. Capitals have a big penalty. If you REALLY want to attack someone but dont want the warmonger penalty for declaring a war against them on top of the penalty youll be getting from capturing their cities you can provoke them into being the one to declare. In my experience you want them to have a bigger army value than you or else theyll just whine and denounce. Do all the above stuff to infuriate them. Bit of a gambit but fun.Cheers.,civ,cffivmn,4,t5_2rk3b

409697,0,t3_1yqw3i,I love this idea but I fear that balancing in the early game would be difficult. For the Huns to be powerful enough to be worthwhile they would have to have a lot of military strength the problem with that is that they would then be able to easily overwhelm other civs in the early game. Thus I would propose the following rules for them Cannot conquer cities or citystates until the Renaissance era. Cannot build Settlers until one city has been conquered. Instead of a Settler the Huns start with the unique unit Attilas Court. This unit functions as a mobile city that can only build military units. Border size depends on number of units. There is no Population. Military units can work tiles the way a Citizen would within Attilas Courts borders but cannot improve them. If Attilas Courts borders overlap with the borders of another civ on a tile Attilas Court takes precedence only if a military unit is working that tile. Attilas Court cannot return to a tile for  turns and must move each turn if it boxes itself in a path is formed that it must walk until its no longer boxed in. Units can pillage tile improvements and get a certain amount of science wealth and culture from them.I feel like this might be overly complicated but Id love to play with a Civ like this and I did my best to try to balance it.,civ,cfn8ciq,4,t5_2rk3b

517959,0,t3_2023z7,England.Nab the Great Lighthouse and the Exploration opener and your navy will pretty much be twice as fast as your enemies. This is particularly useful in the early Renaissance where your Ships of the Line will be more powerful and much faster than anything else on the map. The Longbowman is essentially a Medieval artillery unit able to fire on enemies and cities without them being able to fire back. A useful strategy is to put a spy in the city youre attacking so that your Longbowmen can see the city and attack it while being out of range of the citys attack. Plus the extra tile of range is kept when the unit is promoted so you can have Gatling Guns and Machine Guns with a range of two rather than one.Speaking of spies the second spy is surprisingly useful. Where every other civ must decide whether to spy on their enemies or to defend their own capital England can do both right from the start. One of my favourite strategies is to turtle up defending myself with Longbowmen until I have the Great Lighthouse the Exploration opener and the Brandenburg Gate. I then pump out Ships of the Line with a range of three and movement of nine tiles. I can take entire coastlines in a handful of turns and once Ive secured the coastline I can start moving inland.,civ,cfz59bs,66,t5_2rk3b

So no there are no AI in NQ MP games. Yeah its tough to find the time but the games are ridiculously rewarding. You also tend to create really strong bonds with the other players due to the amount of time you spend in a unique world forging history together.

I usually try to make large waves of military so if I have to Ill be over to take multiple people at once. If possible gift useless cities to other warmonger civs especially Attila. If you want to avoid diplomatic issues try to take on Neighboring civilizations Before they meet anybody else. Nobody will ever know you took them over. Another way to avoid diplomatic issues is to DoW civs that are denouncedalready at war with other civs. Another plan is to ask other civs to go to war with them too. In order to help deal with happiness and you have manageable money you can annex a city purchase a courthouse then purchase a happiness building if you have to. What else... Make sure all luxuries are improved buy them from other civilizations Obtain from Allied city states. Build all happiness buildings if possible if struggling with happiness.Im not sure if this helps too much but I triedEdit Dont take over a Civilization if they have a lot of friends. Try to kill civilizations that have numerous denunciations on them already If possible avoid taking every city they have and just aim for capital cities. Youll go way quicker in towards your Domination victory and also people will not find you a warmonger as quick. Killing a civs last city can give you either a major or in rare cases an Extreme warmonger penalty.  War is easiest postindustrial In My Opinion especially if you have an advantage. But After the world congress is founded its harder to maintain relationships if youre a warmongering civilization because everyone knows each other and sees what is going on. Its more likely for denunciations to come in waves after you destroy a civilization. unless everyone hates them People you have Declarations of Friendships with are less likely to see you as warmongers.. but only for a short while they wont let it go unnoticed.

684291,0,t3_21z63d,For me it depends on the game. I can be building cities in the very late game especially with Order. Is there land free? Would it prove to be a strategic location assualting another civ coastal city near enough to the enemy to send units from and heal them but far enough away not to be swarmed by enemy forces? Tundra tiles now have a bounty of new strategic resources? With trade routes especially in the late game you can rapidly develop a newly settled city and if your economy is strong enough you can buy the key buildings you need to get that city of the ground too. Not only that but by the time you have ideologies happiness really stops becoming so much of an issue making the late game surprisingly one of the best times to expand. Although only really in multiplayer where games can be won or lost throughout the match in single player its fairly clear who is going to win by the midlate game and not much can be done to stop that. ,civ,cgi1znd,1,t5_2rk3b

735250,0,t3_22jds8,Found mostly coastal cities. This will allow you to spend trade routes giving your cities food with cargo ships. Caravans can give about  food while cargo ships give  food. This means each city will basically have  hanging gardens without even needing to work tiles or spend lots of time making them. I usually go quickly for notre dame so I can withstand the population I end up having. This strategy requires freedom as a must. The  unhappiness and food from specialists is so beneficial by itself but also the Statue of Liberty giving you  production per specialist is amazing. I usually end up having  cities with  production each  science per turn however only  happiness. This is on immortal difficulty. By modern era if use the cargo ships correctly each city should have around  citizens which once you get freedom will rise even higher.Heres the complicated part. You have to decide more food or production science is not changed in either. To go food you need to go food focus then switch to great person focus. For production focus you need to do the same thing but do production focus instead of food. This will put all your specialists on but keep working the same tiles you for the focus you want.

There is no point to play a huge mapKing if you usually destroy Emperor AIs for exemple. What kind of speed do you play at?Obviously it is quite enjoyable to play a slower paced game on a bigger maps from time to time but I feel like Civ V is faster paced than the previous instalments partly due to how close you spawn to your direct neighbours.Other times you get uninjured out of the medieval era and you know youre just gonna win the game in a couple hundred turns. If you get bored from knowing youre gonna win up the difficulty or try something non standard. For instance if you were going for a science victory use your bulbs and science towards discovering Stealth and go for a Domination victory in the late game.Also try and avoid OP Civs unless you absolutly want to dominate because Shaka and Attila gangba you in your previous game and you want revenge aka Bab Kor China and the like.Nothing funniermore exciting than to try other settings and Civs and try things out.

864634,0,t1_ch01qfw,I was wondering if you could retake the screencap with it at  population.  I was counting republic twice so while my numbers were the same with  population it should actually only be . production as the max.  Im putting together a really long and detailed imgur album with all the max yields.  It also is really tough for yields like culture and tourism to get it to work since Ive found the IGE to be really buggy at times and make things calculate wrong if done the wrong way.  Heres what I have so far...Faith  not optimal yet... I found it can actually get higher if you have your city not a holy city  Food  As far as I know this is optimal  Science  Should be optimal  And my culture attempts so far...IGE bugged the numbers on this one as well as it not being optimal  I thought this was optimal but it turns out I created a situation that is not possible in game  This is almost optimal... I cant get the game to correctly give me a second pantheon through religious tolerance.  It shows a  culture next to my shrine from ancestor worship but it doesnt add to the total for some reasonFor tourism it might be the last culture example if I made it a holy city and passed world religion or it might be Brazil under the same conditions with carnival.  Have to look into that.Also I created a long list of rules in creating these....Have to have supplemental calculations in order to verify the max the in game editor tends to accidentally create an invisible copies of a building especially free buildings that get added to the total.  Buildings have to be added in a certain order to prevent this.  .City population of  every tile worked every specialist spot filled  .No natural wonders within the vicinity of the city  .Since landmarks dont work properly in the in game editor and scenario builder landmark sites are also not allowed although if you could manage to get them to work it would be pretty impressive for both culture and tourism  .You can act like the city was under previous ownership for instance in the culture example France taking over a Polynesian city with maoi becomes the highest yield as well as put the palace in that city unless  the calculations specifically designated the city as not being a capital like production for railroad connection bonus as well as have all  ideology wonders.  .Since you can buy religious buildings if your city converts to another religion temporarily all religious buildings are available without using them as the current follower beliefs of your religion  .No impossible scenarios that the game wouldnt allow coastal tiles in a body of water that is less than  tiles large solar plant in the same city as nuke plant freedom and order tenets at the same time etc.  .Since unique buildings dont carry over after capture you can only use the UB of the civ you are playing  .Can only be applicable on the most current patch with all DLC and expansions.  Any exploits that have been patched out cannot be used for instance wat and university in the same city  .Internal trade routes are in play although since they dont get multiplied by the  multipliers they are not always the most efficient way as in the case of Germany and production  .No bonuses from citystates really only applies for food and maritime city states since those are calculated in the city yield unlike culture and faith.  .No bonuses from founder beliefs since these are almost limitless in their yield.  Follower beliefs and pantheons are fair game.   ,civ,ch2kbk4,1,t5_2rk3b

Heretofore is simply here to fore condensed into a single word. Unforeseen was not originally un fore seen. See the difference?gtSo you are saying this is intrinsic to all language that has ever existed? I thought languages had been shown to develop in completely different ways in some communitys that have been isolated for thousands of years?Because if not then surely it is to do with tradition because you are only talking about how English or all modern languaes or whatever operate?No just talking about English but that doesnt detract from the point. Languages have rules. These rules are not simply tradition they are an intrinsic part of what makes them mutually comprehensible. There are variations in these rules from situation to situation dialect to dialect and so on and thats absolutely fine and normal but that doesnt change the fact that we understand the function of words in terms of how they fit into these sets of rules.With that in mind the point is not that we dont write alot because thats not how things are done its because combining a and lot into a single word simply doesnt serve a purpose. Heretofore happened because here to and fore were occurring together so often and with such little variability in their arrangement that it made practical sense to make the phrase its own word more accurately three related words heretofore theretofore and wheretofore. While a and lot occur together often a and bit also occur together often as does a bunch a little a X a Y a Z because a lot is just a piece of common syntactically ordinary English.Basically if youre going to argue that a lot should be alot you may as well argue that not all should be notall.,civ,chaz767,1,t5_2rk3b

Remember you may be trying to establish tourism dominance but the early use of Order can keep you in place in science and happiness and keep your empire stable. Getting an ideology from advancing to the modern era often sets you back as early adopter tenets are taken and others are already competing for their ideology to reign supreme.influenceBe sure to invest in specialists within the  guilds writing art and music for they allow your civilization to create a more influential cultural and tourist reign on other nations. The earlier the better because the amount of tourism will snowball quickly during the midend game. The earlier greatworks may also be used within world wonders to get a Theming Bonus giving an extra boost in your tourism. Your tourism influence will cause people to dissent even revolt against their ideology that is not yours. A United Nations proposal of World Order also exerts tourism pressure on other nations as well. The ensuing dissent and resistance to change can cause a lot of unhappiness often persuading their leaders to change. The power of dissent is massive. The most I had seen was ish unhappiness because Oda refused to reform to my ideology. Note that some leaders refuse to make reforms and adhere to popular ideologies literally North Korea.tourism If you are following the Order ideology assuming that you are the third tier Order tenet Dictatorship of the Proletariat gives out a  tourism boost to civilizations that are less happy a massive boost towards tourism exertion.  I love this tenet when going for a cultural Order victory just make sure that your nation is sufficiently satisfied.unhappinessAnd while I know the goal is to peacefully persuade nations to join your ideology if both Dictatorship of the Proletariat and World Order fail or are too slow to competing tourism nations you may need to take care of these huge tourism cities and steal their great works for your own.  Hopefully your attacks will not provoke observing nations try persuading them to attack as well so they wont be too angry. I refer this tactic as a Soviet Offensive Maneuver or SOM as I call it.

973863,0,t1_cheu66t,i thought Id respond properly though this took a bit to write.There is a point very early on where a bigger stack is the only way to take a city other things field battles defending a city can be done quite well with smaller stacks.  For example you can attack a larger stack with just half of yours from a defensive position a hilltop forest ensures that theyll lose far more in any counterattack than you lose if no counter occurs you can heal up and go a second round.  Even if severely outnumbered proper defensive posture can eliminate that  advantage when the first city is taken in the precatapult era.Strategic victories can also be achieved without ever killing a single enemy unit.  Long term science and productive capacities of a rival can be crippled with raids on improvements particularly villages which take a long time to recover after workers rebuild them.  A rival with weaker production can be crippled by forcing them to sacrifice population to keep their stack bigger or you can just bottle them up and take down any settler parties.  All of this ensures that when you come back a second time you come back with a bigger higher tech army or you can just condemn them to irrelevance for the rest of the game if you dont need their territory.Once catapults are invented the game changes a lot collateral damage at the cost of lost catapults supply lines count! can leave an entire stack unable to win offensive engagements until after it heals that mean the giant for the era  man stack that was about to hit your city has to hole up while you bring in reinforcements.  While its healing up cavalry can waltz around them destroying the enemy countryside taking weakly defended cities or just target any reinforcements the enemy tries to bring in.  The ability for catapults to smash city defenses also drastically change the equation its entirely possible to take a city with a small stack once you can get the odds of single win engagements in your favor.Later changes are even more drastic  kill ratios are perfectly possible if the enemy if dumb enough to put all its units in one stack for cannons to chew up air superiority will garuntee it even without that.  To give a concrete example of the kinds of kill ratios superior play can provide I pulled up an old savefile to get specifics early game I took down  longbowmen  archers  catapults  axemen  dog soldiers and  swordsmen I lost  longbowmen  archers  catapults  axemen  preatorian Jesus I remember this fight like  turns of war while outnumbered by Native America was midgunpowder when i finally talked the Vikings into taking their west border and took them down.,civ,chezk7d,3,t5_2rk3b

All their claims that this isnt an AC sequel read like a thinly veiled attempt at avoiding a lawsuit.I recognize itll be different possibly very different  AC is more than a decade old at this point it would be weird if they just kicked out a direct blatant sequel in all its CivIIinspired design features.But overall they definitely seem to be trying for a sequel here. They cannot legally call it a sequel and they cant name it Alpha Centauri but beyond that everything theyve released sounds like its a sequel with a little but we dont want EA to sue us so its totally not a sequel trust us! disclaimer attached.Itll probably be a sequel to Civ V and Alpha Centauri combined though given that Civ V was itself a kind of sequel to Alpha Centauri moreso than III and IV were then that makes sense.Maybe Im ignorant who knows.

More advanced units would need more supply potentially all the way from one of your cities. As such wagon trains like trade routes would be required to keep your army in full nick. This would naturally limit the number of units per tile but that could also be tied to techs.

A library wont give you the equivalent  science until pop  and with a piety opener you can build shrines in half the time and it has such synergy. Yes with tradition you can get the steles prebuilt with legalism but religion really scales well with large empires. If I wasnt going to go piety andor wide and play a tall game Id pick Ethiopia over the maya.

After that they are flexible in any of the victory conditions. As it was mentioned earlier make sure you use extra gold to buy buildings in Rome. I would also try and avoid building wonders in Rome as much as possible get one city focused on production to do the wonder building. Rome needs to be focused on the normal buildings.Dont forget that you can use Legions to build roads you can save money by having your military focus on city connections while your workers which you can have less of thanks to Legions focus on improvements.,civ,chx6gr5,1,t5_2rk3b

So for example they decide to go to war they prepare for war then they declare war. At each stop they reevaluate the situation. So its entirely possible that they decide to go to war and then later change their mind. Sadly I remember reading this a while ago on Civfanatics but Ill be damned if I can find the explanation now.

Adapting this theme how about Religious Buildings in the Capital provide  Great Engineer Point?This would fill the void of a Great Engineer Civ vs. Babylon and Venice and fits due to the numerous Wonders and protoindustrial output of Byzantium. It also provides a worthy incentive to adopt Piety for doubled production of Shrine and Temple and a discount on buying the Belief Buildings for even more Engineer points.Its just a quick idea and I havent worked out what Great Engineer generation it would result in. Its worth noting there would be one big counterpoint to balance it it would be very hard to generate Great Scientists if you get a lot of Engineers.

The ability to move after attacking on a ranged horse unit is extremely extremely powerful letting you move into range shoot then retreat so that you can deal damage or kill units without your opponent being able to attack at all. You can even take cities that are adjacent to a flatland area this way without giving the city any opportunity to return fire.

Now I have a whole plan of attack for cultural games while keeping myself open to any unplanned events such as wars getting beaten on wonders etc..When Im feeling out a Civ I play a game on Tiny and if I win I go to Small then Standard etc.  I try to learn them in the simplest terms then add more and more complexities to the game.,civ,cj9bjyj,1,t5_2rk3b

1543252,0,t3_2bw6to,The strongest way to deal with barbs is to found your cities relatively close to one another. That drastically cuts down on the units needed. Other than that aggressively hunting barb camps is a major factor and you can also deliberately set up workers to be captured to give your city free attacks as long as you retake the worker the next turn. This is  a crucial trick for dealing with scary units becuse a pillaging scary unit will be healing and last way longer than one taking your worker and walking into city range to do it. that hp heal is a huge deal with early spears or horsemen or swordsmen when you have an archer a scout and a warrior. My favored pacifist build order is  scout my starting warrior  and one archer. The archer is expensive but clears camps and empties the coast of barbarian boats the scout is cheap and either bodyblocks barbs or supports my archer in clearing camps and the warrior does most of my actual barb killing staying close  to home where his decisive attacks can be paired with fast healing. To clear a camp effectively you want to have a melee unit a scout adjcacent to the camp to claim it the same turn you empty it and then the barbs just wander around aimlessly a lot of the time. Dont farm exp on deity you will most of the time max out anyways. Kill stuff as quickly as possible and preserve unit health. Also it often makes sense to delay scouting. A horsetrireme combo does it far far better than a scout anyways and you can more easily afford the production early rather than late. Plus waiting for civil service also means waiting for roads and it makes far more sense to have a horse scouting the area at  tiles per turn instead of a scout doing it at . And frankly caravels are plenty early to find out what the fourth closest neighbor to you really has in terms of land and cities. And if you fail to clear the camps in time you really might just need to spam  more of the cheapest units you can find to deal with barbarian horsies. The key to dealing with horsemen has nothing to do with killing them and everything to do with pinning them in place and preventhing them from just running past you burning all your farms and healing so much that they live forever. ,civ,cj9py9p,1,t5_2rk3b

1548978,0,t1_cjaex8z,that would be a great feature indeed. the problem i see with making a blank slate template to make a custom civ is that all the icons need to be referenced and whatnot. like they need to reference an image file from another file to apply it which makes it harder unless you do multiple generics. i.e. a middle eastern themed template an oriental themed a europeanwestern theme and a tribal theme. and then those would have to be broken down even further with each one of those themes having their own branches for slots  that has a UU and a UB another that has  UUs a third that has a UU and a UI etc. it would basically need to be a collaboration effort by multiple modders or a modder who has a MASSIVE amount of spare time to do all that work.id rather see it be a standard feature of the game but more like the way religions are handled Pick your leaders portrait then have a list of types of UAs each with their own sublist ex production bonus which can be prod from x sources x towards y type of unitstructurewonder etc next choose a UU and have a pre made list of units to choose from and pick its portrait next choose either a UBUI or a second UU with similar pre made lists for each then pick their playstyle for the AI to use either use existing leader stats or have smart sliders to fine tune their personality and lastly name your leader and civ then either save them for later use andor proceed straight into game setup to play your newly created civ,civ,cjafrw1,1,t5_2rk3b

1576025,0,t1_cjdq01k,You very much can say this is mostly Civ. The entire economic system in the game is still Civs. Population generates science you have trade routes a global resource limits expansion in BE its health aka happiness. The base game that is the fundamental mechanics are Civs. The core mechanics governing economy research and expansion are the HEART of the Civ series and drive the majority of the game so just from that I can say BE is going to play mostly like Civ. But whats new?We have a quest system...except we already had that with citystates. Sure quests in BE are likely to be deeper but its still the same concept just expanded upon.Affinities! You pick one of three and it gives you unique benefits and shapes diplomacy! Again this is just Civs ideologies but expanded upon.The are some nifty stuff you can do with miasma and aliens but thats a minor that thing cannot carry a game on its own.The diplomacy system is the same as Civthe designers themselves have said so. There are minor improvements like the favor system but its the same thing in essence.Oh cool we have a tech web instead of tree. In practice its not that innovative it just means you have a tech tree where you dont have to research everything to move forward. Thats it. It doesnt fix the fundamental issue of technologies in the Civ series namely the fact that players will often solve the tech tree and find the ultimate ideal path. You know what would solve this? A randomized tech tree like in Master of Orion.The new victory conditions are all research machine build machine defend machine where the machine is contact with alienstalk with the planetwarpgate to Earth. Also in Civ after you launched the spaceship you still had to defend yourself for  turns before victory could be claimed. It was terribly boring and mattered in  of games. Having to defend aka wait for your victory condition to trigger doesnt sound lots of fun.This is mostly an extended Civ mod or scenario. If you have been getting tired of Civ then BE presents enough novelty for Civ to feel fresh again but its still the same game.,civ,cjdtwms,-6,t5_2rk3b

Some might reroll certain starts tundra because they doubt they can get the needed pantheon to really maximize it. Now a pantheon is just icing whereas the actual bonus resource is the true cake. After building the granary bananas is the best unimproved resource in the game with  food.

Weve done the math before and the Culture that the Honor opener gets you even in extremely favorable raging barbarian situations is still completely eclipsed by what you would get from LibertyTradition. Dont waste a policy in it. You already get Culture from military trades why waste time just adding a flat bonus to it that you can do on any Civ. There is no synergy.If youre trying to just max out culture this might be accurate . But this overlooks an incredibly powerful policy in the Honor tree Military Tradition which gives you  more XP from combat. Upgrading military units to the point of double hits additional range and added defense allows you to field a smaller more efficient army.

1872295,0,t3_2fya7h,I think this Civ may be stronger than intended mostly because the UA makes you a stronger much more consistent version of Spain.Doing a quick  city Tradition opener means that youre getting  gold and  faith for every luxury you connect. Since this includes luxuries from tradescity states you have lots of control over when you get the boosts. This also means that unless your starting area is ridiculously resourcepoor youre going to have access to way more money than any other Civ. I mean Spain might luck into  gold early and then another few hundred later on but the Philistines can get  every dozen turns or so plus a ton of faith.I gave it a try on Immortal and very quickly ran away with the game simply by settling  cities before turn  I bought a Settler with cash from my first two feasts. From there the feasts gave me enough faith to be first to found and enhance a religion and enough gold to buy most of my infrastructure and field an army big enough to take over two neighbours before the Renaissance. Also with two policies in Patronage allying a CS for  gold basically pays for itself if you get a new luxury.I definitely think that the numbers need to be tweaked a bit.Also Im not getting a feast upon city capture.

Im thinking one of the tiles next to it for the observatory bonus but theres different rationale for every one Settling to the west gives me slightly better access to food which would be nice for growth. But Im not too afraid of importing food. This puts marble which I dont have out of reach. Settling to the north cuts out Monacos growth and eventually gives me marble. Settling to the east gives me immediate access to stone iron and Marble very quickly but the food situation is pretty dire. Settling south seems to confer no big advantages except for maybe some forest. Its kind of the mixed bag. ,civ,cku93uk,2,t5_2rk3b

2040557,0,t3_2i53z9,The UA is ok. The tile purchase bonus makes getting luxuries and key tiles less painful but if you were stuggling with that the Shoshone would be a better pick.  Sight is really nice for scouting and warfare but if you want to go to war a lot there are a lot of better options. This is however the second stongest trait they have IMO.The Minuteman is a cool unit that is very mobile however it does not make the other parts of your army the ranged mounted and siege units more mobile and youre often stuck waiting around for those units anyway. Also golden age points on kill isnt really all that good Melee units arent doing the killing they are taking hits. Not that good of a unit especially when you compare it to the Ottoman Janissary.The B is very strong. Getting air repair with only  EXP modifiers is crazy good however it comes so late and requires a strategic resource and just isnt going to turn around a slow start because of how late it comes.

2048149,0,t1_ckzx9an,Heres one example I edited the map for the sake of having an example. Those plains around Porto and where the Pikeman was standing on were originally coastal tiles. Its a bit of an extreme example but yeah.Lets do a whatif scenario. Supposing you just discovered Sailing that the map to the left is a huge land mass while the land to the right as you can see is more landmass only thinner. I want to trade food to Porto but I dont have any caravans.If you attempt to trade food to Porto your cargo ship wont reach. As soon as you discover Sailing cargo ships only have a maximum of  cells to reach its destination. However if there was a canal city to where that Pikeman on the right is standing or to the cell left of it the cargo ship will just have enough cells to reach its destination. Similarly if there were foreign civs in nearby islands willing to establish trade to either one of the cities but was on the other side of the sea they might be able to establish trade with you if there was a canal city.Thats just one example of course. Another benefit would be cutting the time for your ships to move from one sea to another.,civ,cl05xvw,2,t5_2rk3b

2178470,0,t3_2jzlw4,Play Zulu or Germany though Poland Maya and Inca are surprisingly good for war as well.    Spend the early part of the game focusing on expanding like crazy.  The more cities you have the more sciencegoldproduction you can have.  And it has the bonus benefit of getting people mad at you which you want.    Focus on Science and Production above all else.  You need to always be at least equal if not ahead of the computer in science.  New advancements in technology means you have the edge in military strength.  If youre attacking the Iroquois with Artillery and Riflemen while he still has Mohawk Warriors you will steamroll him.  Of course this is harder to do in ImmortalDeity but super easy to do on PrinceKing.    Do tons of passive tactics to make computers attack you never declare war on the computer unless absolutely necessary.  Promise lots of things I wont settle near you I wont buy your land I wont steal your city states etc and then break every promise.  This will get computers so mad they will be the first to attack you while making the other computers sympathetic to your fight.    Pick one major civ to always be friendly with and never backstab.  Usually another warmongering civ like Zulu Germany Mongolia Aztecs Greece or Poland.  This will be the guy you trade luxuries strategic resources and gold with.  As well as making scientific agreements.  Then once youve taken out all the other civs you backstab them and take them over.    Completely ignore wonders except the Statue of Zeus.  Why build wonders when youre gonna take over their cities anyway?  Let the Brazils Indias and Egypts of the world build the wonders while you amass an army.  Then you take their wonders by force.    Rush to Artillery as fast as possible.  It will be the absolute best unit to help your war effort.  Especially taking cities.  Having  artillery bombing a city for  turns and you will easily take a city.  Then just rush in with a KnightCalvary sitting  tiles away and take the city.    Alternatively you want to rush to bombers as soon as possible as well.  Theyre basically stronger artillery which you can spam without fear of melee unit attacks.  You can directly hit a city while avoiding the computers endless infantry.    Try to take the bulk of civs before the ModernAtomic eras hit.  The more cities you have conquered the more productionscience you have.  Then just spam military units and take the last  civs in the AtomicInformation era.    Use your excess gold to take over the city states.  This will give you tons of extra happinessculture and also help you control the world congress.  Nothing worse than playing a  turn game and then getting a crippling embargo put on you.  Unless youre Germany and you probably dont care.    It should be pretty obvious but go Order or Autocracy.    ,civ,clgqiy3,2,t5_2rk3b

2213597,0,t3_2kgv9j,Hoo boy. A lot of things spring to mind here. A few wellmade faction mods drawing from relevant scifi universes with similar starting techlevels to BE  like the Helghan Corporation from Killzone for instance or the MoonNazis from Iron Sky. Hell maybe get the Strogg in from the Quake series and reskin some of the Supremacy units to look more fleshy. Something similar to the Ethnic Units mod from Civ  that at least makes the Tier  and  units where Affinity has no influence on appearance look factionspecific. For instance the ARC would keep the regular guntoting Niel Armstrong look for their Soldier unit while the Slavic Federation would have something looking a lot more like a cyberpunk Sovietera Cosmonaut. Meanwhile some of the historically lessspacefaring factions FrancoIberia Brasilia etc go the Avatar route IE nearfuture infantry uniforms with oxygen masks which have nationspecific visual features. An Alien natives mod which includes triballevel alien humanoids with their own minor settlements whose presence ties into quest and affinity choices and have lasting consequences IE if you enslave or exploit them as part of the Purity affinity you risk giving them the tools and means to stage a revolt and cause you serious internal problems  go Harmony however and you might be able to recruit them as more capable Explorer replacements and so on. Bit of a personal choice here but a total conversion in the style of the R.E.D WW Mod for Civ  replicating the WHk universe. Only because the k vidyagame roster deserves an Epic kstyle grand strategy... insofar as the Civ model can be called grand strategy. For anyone who isnt a fan maybe something in a similar vein but for other multifaction scifi universes  as long as its done in the R.E.D style with relevant changes to the units tech trees and other gameplay systems that reflect the universe being adapted.Thats just my two cents.,civ,cll79h4,14,t5_2rk3b

Its not hit nearly as hard by ideologies because its the only SP tree where delaying its completion is actually a good thing. Its the early stuff that you really need ASAPRationalisms opener is arguably its most powerful aspect as a flat  to overall science output is significant and will only become more powerful as the game goes on.Then youve got Secularism which again is extraordinarily powerful especially when combined with Freedoms specialist tenets. Humanism isnt too shabby either considering how powerful Great Scientists are and of course it unlocks the excellent Free Thought.IMHO Opener  Secularism are all you really need before hitting an ideology but getting up to Free Thought is great.

It doesnt give you any unfair advantages doesnt disable achievements can be used in multiplayer and makes everything way more convenient.Yet not Another Earth Map Pack also deserves honorable mention. It has several realworld maps including some absurdly large Earth maps and all of them have historical start locations. Its nice though the larger maps do tend to make for very slow games.Edit Also Ive never played it but Ive heard good things about Communitas  specifically that its the most ambitious Civ V mod to date and that people seem to really like it.

Instead my goal is to make as much money as possible by selling certain services to each player. Say someone wants me as an ally in a war. I may ask for  gold and for that Ill kill  enemy units GPT and Ill take a city for you. Once the job is complete I immediately make peace and go back to being neutral.

2253012,0,t3_2l01nd,Edit looks like my answer is wrong too and this post provides the most credible sounding explanation. Probably should be the top answer! Apparently military naval units cant pass through thirdparty civilian units making it a bizarre and almostneverseen exception to the games standard movement rules.Original responseI believe all of the answers youve gotten so far are wrong. That or Im losing my mind anyway...gtMilitary and Civilian units of different nations can never go through each other.This definitely isnt true. Its true for civilian units but not military ones. As long as youre not at war and as long as you have enough move a military unit can run through another civs units I believe. You just need to rightclick to move the unit multiple spaces plotting a path thatll end the unit in a valid space on the same turn.gtBecause... its a citystate? You can only use your own cities as canals.Also not true. Its definitely possible.Im honestly not sure why you cant use this as a canal as far as I can tell you should be able to. So Im going to make a wild guess here and say that maybe there was a submarine on the tile you highlighted. When going through AI units you need to have enough move to end completely clear of them when you finish the move otherwise it wont work.Your destroyer only has  move what happens if you end the turn and try to send it furtherdeeper into the lake when you have  move available? Does that still not work? If not Id say its maybe something the patch did...,civ,clq70f6,5,t5_2rk3b

Thus I thought Id just link it directly and hopefully more people will see it.To any newcomers to the franchise Complete is very strongly recommended because it includes the expansions. The expansions are extremely high quality and add a great deal to the game to the point where many people who hated the vanilla release ended up liking the final product.Also to clarify Civ V is a Steamworks game. You do get a Steam code for buying it from Newegg.

2444651,0,t3_2nibzd,Beyond Earth is getting a lot of hate and a fair portion of it seems to be from mismanaged expectations as to what it would be. There are certainly balance problems with the game which the incoming patch will address and some mechanics that could definitely be fleshed out more mmuh expacs but this was true of Civ V as well.I would definitely pick up Beyond Earth now. Its still a fun game and is completely playable as it is now. If its release state were the final form of the game it would definitely be at least a little disappointing but as it is its quite fun and a fantastic twist on the some ol Civ V formula.However theres a few relatively major issues with BE now Victories and hence the endgame are pretty boring. There is only one victory for each Affinity the Domination and a twist on the Science victory called Contact. This means that about every game youre playing will end up the same and youre relatively locked into that style pretty early on. Each Affinitys victory is a little different but they all involve waiting a number of turns after youve built the Wonder that allows for victory. With only  Leaders the game can feel pretty repetitious even if the AI wind up with vastly different playstyles each time and the loadout options provide  ways to start off. However this is a bit inverted from Civ Vin Beyond Earth you start out about the same and diverge based on which techs you get which tile improvements you build and which Affinities you choose whereas in Civ V you start out relatively different depending on how early each civs Uniques are and all become the same.If youre ok with these things and the game lacking whatever personality you found Civ V to have youll probably enjoy BE. I for one like having the flexibility to go through the tech web in a bunch of different ways rather than always beelining the next science tech so I love Beyond Earth for this reason. On the other hand I have more fun maxing out my cities than I do actually trying to win because the victory conditions get rather tedious.,civ,cmdv37t,9,t5_2rk3b

The other spot Id consider is the jungle next to spices that has more reasonable food and production but you still sacrifice river and you still have to buy your way to Kilimanjaro.In short Id wait to take Kilimanjaro with at least third city.

If youre using EUI and other mods make sure the proper files have been deleted or otherwise adjusted to prevent such an issue from occurring.,civ,cmthwlg,1,t5_2rk3b

You could also put another city on the northern hill two tiles above highlighted yellow tile since it gives you four sea resources a city on the other side of the continent and a potential great citadel into Koreas land for spices provided you dont kill him first.

I generally aim for  cities and a NC by turn .  You need Philosophy for the NC so I usually prioritize the prereqs for that.Its a perfectly fine strategy to rush Camel Archers as Harun but you dont need Construction for Chivalry.  If youre going to rush any tech Id make it Currency to try to grab Petra especially since Currency is on the Chivalry route.Though doesnt seem like you have a good Petra spot unless youd gone to the desert hills to the southwest so IDK about that one.ToA is a great wonder but you almost never get it on difficulties higher than King.  If youre going to be warmongering maybe its better to just take the city that has it?Social policy wise just remember that the earlier you get your cities out the better.  The danger of a TraditionLiberty hybrid like you did is that your free settler policy doesnt come until policy  which is often too late.

2749187,0,t1_cngdzqi,gt Coastal tiles are basically grasslands or tundra that you cant improve with farms.Thats true but you know what seriously fuck the inability to build boats and do sea trade routes. Its not so bad once you have like at least  or  coastal cities but there were so many times I was annoyed by having an inland city that had high production but couldnt contribute to my navy for me. This is one of the reasons I personally like Petra less than other people because youre often forced to settle inland if you really want to make use of those desert hills and thus that city will never be good for privateers frigates battleships submarines etc despite otherwise potentially being an awesome place to build them. So long as a coastal city has at least half of its tiles being land its not so painful. Only peninsula and island cities tend to really hurt for production in my experience.,civ,cngkkcj,2,t5_2rk3b

However you should absolutely get Enhanced User Interface this one is trickier to set up than other mods but worth it already posted by uwhysnakes Faster Aircraft and Quick turns to reduce the amount of waiting. Global relations or Info Addict to better illustrate graphs and data. I prefer the former because it doesnt reveal hidden information but either works.I think all Civ players can agree that these are awesome mods that absolutely enhance the experience. There are other mods that I would personally recommend to buff weak leaders units and programming. For instance an Isabella tweak to make Spain less luckdependent and Natural Wonder fixes to prevent absurd placements.

Changing the terrain type rainfall and world age in BE has a much bigger impact than in CiV and a Pangae map with terrain type as Desert will play completely different to one set to lush.Leaders have effectively been replaced with choosing your colonist loadout different colonists ships and cargos play differently and the old UAs have mostly been worked into virtues. Then the actual ingame stuff ensures its different in CiV theres pretty much one acceptable tech path and policy path whereas BEs web and Virtues can be tackled in many different ways which completely change how you play the game focusing on Prosperity and health techs is going to have a radically different play style to focusing on Might and military techs and then theres the Affinities which do have an impact on how warring works attacking a target as Supremacy is actually different to attacking it as Purity  range high damage artillery SABRs are fun compared to CiV where war is pretty similar for all leaders not to mention how the affinity buildings change what you can get away with.The game seems simple and repetitive before you figure out how it works but its got a surprising amount of depth and customisability.,civ,cnkofur,5,t5_2rk3b

They had perfectly fine lands to the west of them to settle not like they generally care much about happiness anyways and more than enough army to clear the barbarians out if that was the problem.

2818793,0,t3_2scfje,I love this!  My gaming PC is down right now so Im getting my civ fix vicariously through this series!  Here is my read on the situation    I think all the Western European Scandinavian and Middle Eastern nations are pretty much done for.  None can really expand and theyre all stuck in brutal knife fights and hopeless wars of attrition over a few squares and cities.  By the time a one clearly pulls ahead theyll be competing with superpowers in other regions.   Eastern Europe is more interesting.  Russia is in a good place and is poised to make a big move as long as she doesnt try to fight a war on multiple fronts.  Shes quietly gotten herself near the top of all the demographics.  Shes got the capability to move into Scandinavia or towards Western Europe through Poland.  She could also try and smash her way through the border the Huns have built around her but they are pretty closely matched.  Meanwhile Atillia has to decide if he wants to continue expanding east towards the Mongolian juggernaut or kick off the inevitable war with Russia.The Far East belongs to Genghis as soon as he decides whether or not he wants to take it.  Maybe hell try to find more difficult quarry in India or with the Huns.  He could also bide his time and continue to expand and be no worse for wear.  Japan and Indonesia are irrelevant except to act as a distraction for Genghis perhaps giving Attila and Gandhi some breathing room.            I think Shaka has the most potential to change the game right now if he can systematically move through the African nations one at a time.  His Impi are up so now is his time to close the deal.  Hopefully he doesnt do something stupid like try to invade Siam or something.  If the Songhai plan on staying relevant and holding off the Zulu horde they need to quickly take out their North African neighbors.  Time is not on their side.       In South America Brazil is clearly the most powerful but they havent achieved the critical mass required to overwhelm Incan mountain defenses.   North America is the most interesting.  The Iroquois dont have much of a chance being sandwiched between the three competing major powers.  As dominant as the massive Shoshone nation seems America has surpassed them in population and is quickly catching up land tech economy and military.  Montezuma is closely matched with America and the Shoshone and as we all know his aggression can make up for some minor differences.  I think the battle for North America is totally up for grabs at this point.,civ,cnohnan,13,t5_2rk3b

On marathon they can capture all my cities before I even produce one unit.Quick rewards reactive play use resources only when you need them marathon rewards careful planning runs the risk of miscalculating and wasting resources.The other thing is that on Deity the AIs early worker and settler will get around much quicker.

2850992,0,t1_cnrc35t,Wide First off you need to understand the difference between empire happiness and local happiness. Forgive me if you already know this. Empire happiness bonuses are always applicable local happiness only applies if you have at least as much population as local happiness. For example suppose youve got a town with a coleseum and a pagoda. Thats a total of four local happiness. But if you only have  population in that town youre only getting  happiness out of those buildings. If you have  pop youre getting all  happiness.Remember that Meritocracy provides empire happiness not local happiness. Take that same city from before and now its contributing  happiness for its  population. With Meritocracy a city that has a population equal to its local happiness actually contributes extra happiness.And it is not bad to cap most of your cities population like this. One of the major benefits of going wide is that instead of working ordinary tiles most of your population is going to be working resource tiles meaning that your population will be substantially more productive per unit. And among these tiles will be luxury tiles which will allow you to grow your cities even more.Dipomacy As to diplomacy the AI doesnt actually hate it so much as mildly dislike it. Keep one military unit per city and for the most part theyll leave you alone. Declare friendship fight common foes and theyll love you. Virtuous Conquest As to that third one you have to fight and you should bribe the AI to fight with you... not so theyll do your fighting for you you should have your army pretty well deployed before you get them involved but so you can get common foe diplomacy bonuses. Ask first save bribe money for your more reluctant allies. Second if any of their cities are captured cities liberate them the AI loves this. Third you dont actually have to capture their cities to cripple them for the rest of the game. Demolish their army raze their countryside force them into a crippling peace agreement. You probably wont have any problems with them and if you do theyll be easily dealt with giving you the opportunity to renew that crippling peace agreement.,civ,cns5omg,2,t5_2rk3b

My question is Why doesnt it add the food and production bonus to adjacent coast tiles?It was a design choice we never considered. If did consider it it may make things slightly overpowered if say a Fish resource was nearby Fish turn into seals if adjacent to Snow Tundra Ice tiles but retain the same yields as fish.gtAlso when building the Inuksuk outside of the city workable tile limit do those tile bonuses outside the workable tiles count for the city?Yep! We intended for the player to expand the Cultural Borders as much as possible outside territory in order to get more food for Snow cities.gtQuestion Is there any other production bonus regarding Seals? If I trade it do any of my cities get a production bonus?That bonus was cast aside in the update  but it may return in the form of another Civ.If you have any more questions  ask away!

3132654,0,t3_2w0nem,Not just for naval battles but I have always thought that it would make more sense for battles to cause you to lose certain things like a ship could have its mast destroyed in a battle and its movespeed afterwards would take a hit. For land units cavalry could have the riders killed but not the horses. This would cause you to have to go back to your territory to heal because otherwise you are just leading horses around. which could be captured or when cavalry battle you could end up with part of them remaining cavalry and the other half whose horses were killed become footmen or something. swordsmen or warriors or something along those lines. Tanks could have their armor weakened or their crew killed with just empty tank husks for the enemy to capture. Particularly for naval battles ships could lose lots of things and having a situation where a trireme could board a ship of the line with weapons destroyed and no crew but not a ship of the line with weapons but no mast could lead to interesting battles and scenarios. Also naval battles could be improved in that you could choose to board or sink ships and boarding would cost you part of your crew on the first ship but add a skeleton crew to the ship if you succesfully boarded. Keeping your navy well armed healthy and ships in good condition could be imperative to victory. ,civ,comp4ef,3,t5_2rk3b

I wouldnt say it makes them bad at money and technology but its true that Scientific civs are better at technology and Commercial civs do better in their economy..  There are really only two levels of stats  the normal base and then whatever improvements their civ characteristics give them.  For example Scientific civs get the free tech when they reach a new era and buildings like the Library are half price..  This is totally wrong.  War weariness is equal for everyone its government type that determines it.  Republic and Democracy give you lots of war weariness Monarchy and Fascism dont have to worry but their economies arent as good..  I never worry about allies being pissy or not.

Most liberty players in multiplayer do same thing unless theyre going for GL. Then the solution is to either make the AI build way less units making them laughably easy targets or constantly giving the AI huge lump sums of gold every other turn which the AI will just purchase shit with anyway giving it an unreal advantage. Also every game I play on immortal or deity the AI has writing when i meet them or shortly thereafter anyway so Im pretty sure it does grab library tech early idk if they build them though.This is not as easy of a problem to solve as your making it out to be.

You normally start off in a jungle heavy area which already gives you an edge over Korea and Babylon.You start off the game grabbing the honor opener and getting the God of War patheon. This way you are milking double the culture and a little bit of faith from incoming barbarians. This way you are able to finish the entire Tradition tree leaving Poland in the dust! Early on make sure you have a Scout Worker Granary Shrine Floating Gardens Library. Once you have the basic infrastructure set your cities to production and shoot for Temple of Artemis. Take Hanging Gardens instead if someone claims TOA before you. Then grab Oracle and later on Statue of Zeus when convenient. Finish the Honor Tree as you keep racking up culture. That way per kill you are getting culture faith and gold. Build at most  cities declare war on a neighbor and take one of their cities that is on a river. This is so that you can get your killing spree bonuses going. You should have about  upgraded jaguars in your army surrounding the jungles of your key cities and capital. I call them Army of Vampires because they just dont die. The rest should be ranged and siege units and well as a few mounted units. Your first few Caravans should all be dedicated to food trade routes from your capital to new cities. TLDR Make at least  flesh eating jungle breeding jaguars and keep them on defense upgraded regularly. Use religion and policies to gain faith and gold and culture from kills.

3438314,0,t3_2zltrg,Freedom and Order are about evenly split with a small minority going for AutocracyInterestingly even when going for a Domination victory Autocracy only just edges out Freedom which is surprising considering how focused on military and only military Autocracy is.The Ideologies are notwithstanding pretty well balanced. Freedom has fantastic victory tenets but pretty lackluster tier amp tenets while Order is just the opposite. Iron Curtain doesnt feel like it belongs in Order at allId like to see it replaced with some sort of Diplomacycentered bonus like maybe  Delegate for every civ that follows your ideology or something to do with citystates. As it is it doesnt fit in with what is otherwise a peacefocused or at least nonmilitaryfocused Ideology and doesnt offer any clear path to victory in the way that every other tier  tenet does. But even in that respect it at least fits in with the other Order policiesbonuses that will get you up and running pretty quickly but they wont help you actually win.On the other hand Freedom seems a lot more impressive than it actually is because turtling is the easiest path to victory and often on higher difficulties the only consistently viable strategy. Halving the amount of food specialists require is especially powerful since it allows you to keep growing while you work specialist slots and of course New Deal offers a pretty major boosts in science as well assuming youve been planting enough Academies.

Tech advantage is impossible to overestimate in Civ  its easier to conquer the entire world starting from  cities while being way ahead in tech than to conquer the remaining half while equal in tech thats why against AI that doesnt make good enough decisions to keep up in tech playing in a way that maximizes your advantage over them or minimizes your handicap if youre on Diety is usually the best way to win and that involves sticking to roughly four cities you founded yourself.

Stick to three Cities if youre just going Tall easier to manage Happiness and youre less likely to have to Settle a suboptimal spot. Scout around first for the best spots. Build Settlers when your Capital has at least two Hills switch your Citizens to work the Hills while building Settlers. Cities cannot starve while making Settlers so its a good opportunity to crank the capital to max Production. In your other two Cities there should be time for a Shrine or Granary and then the Library. Dont be put off by the initially high build times as the city grows and you start working Production tiles it will drop hugely. If terrain and Happiness allows it an Internal Food Route to a newly founded City can help bring it near the Capitals standard.  Alternatively you can build nonLibrary infrastructure in one City and just purchase it when the time comes for National College. Save up  Gold from trading spare Luxuries GPT Strategic Resources one copy can be sold for GPT meeting CityStates clearing Barb camps Trade Routes etc. Dont build Roads straight away.

3631267,0,t1_cq6410i,Im not sure of how factual anything Im saying is its just conjecture.  There are many native American tribes with distinct cultures and languages yet were connected enough to be grouped together into categories like Plains Indians. Tipis are a way of showing the smaller tribes that were related to and contributed to the Shoshone. They cant be places next to another because they would have competing claims to land and they give culture because they contribute to the diversity of the Shoshone. Also because they are seperate communities they would be rather self sufficient which accounts for the minor boosts to food and production they bring. If you think about them as separate tribes rather than a bunch of houses in a field it makes sense. It would almost be better to call them tribes but it would be weird to build a tribe PI use the Shoshone in this example but modded civs like the Sioux were also plains Indians and so the same applies. Tipis are also in a scenario so theyre easier to mod in so thats something to keep in mind.,civ,cq66xxu,5,t5_2rk3b

There is no reason to ever do it it gives you more unhappiness than a puppet city and cannot do anything while it is in resistance. So you should always puppet or raze or liberate if thats an option and then in the case of puppets annex the city later when you can afford the temporary happiness hit.As for razing it really depends on the quality of the city and the purpose of the war. If you arent going for domination and just want to landgrab most cities except really crappy ones are worth keeping. If youre going for domination you should just raze any city except holy cities and capitals obviously as those cannot be razed that does not fulfill at least one of the following qualities unless you can afford the hit to happiness Has a unique luxury you dont currently have Has a world wonder Is in a strategically important position e.g. canal city on another continent with the intention that it will help you build a presence on that continent,civ,cqzlvs0,1,t5_2rk3b

He also likes to beat people up but it seems that he only gets stronger whenever he finishes beating up a person.

3923935,0,t1_cr3k2qj,gtCiv IV promotions are logical. You have counterpromotions to stop certain unittypes as well as the standard Combatpromotion.The issue is that there are so many and its rarely clear as to which are worthwhile overall.  Civ V kept it simple which makes it easier to plan a units advancement sensibly.You reminded me of something I forgot to mention  too many units.  Every unit had a hard counter specificallywhich meant that upgrading and training again became a tiresome chore.  Civ V?  Way fewer and you can absolutely get away with only going a few types.gtYou dont need religion at all to keep people happy.Yes you really do.  You cant get happiness buildings without it and unless you deliberately hinder your own growth its a consistent issue.gtEspionage is not that big of a deal unless you play against Sitting Bull. But even then the poison of your watersupplies is of limited detriment. Using counterespionage missions and stationing a spy in your own cities makes the enemys espionage cost more and you get a better chance to thwart the spies.No what they did then was constantly sabotage the hell out of my various improvements rather than go for my cities directly.  It was a huge pain in the ass and it frustrated me constantly.gtCollateral is king in Civ IV. If you attack with Siege collateral you can take down any defenses no matter the techlevel or promotions they have.Thats the key thoughif you attack.  If you cant get the first attack for any reason the AI pulls the same on you.  Its a rush to a stack of death and it really means maneuver war is meaningless.  Positioning even becomes less important since a stack can generally avoid another stack unless it really wants to attack that stack.gtCivics are just fine.Not in execution.gt The fact that some are unused in most circumstances is not that bad.Try most.  And it means that the game is utterly repetitive because there was little reason to go for separate civic paths unless you really wanted to kill everyone in war.

4023670,0,t3_36kt1g,Some thoughts on the various civs you mentioned  The Shoshone get an awesome start thanks to their unique ability to claim lots of land when you found cities and the Pathfinder but theyre not very different from any other civ once youre in the middle of the game.  Theyre considered okay because of that awesome start since you can usually convert that into more enduring advantages.  Other civs have more longlasting advantages.  Poland gets a ridiculous amount of social policies at all stage of the game which makes them VERY good because social policies can have some very powerful effects.  The Mayans have their unique ability which will give them many great people throughout the course of the game and their unique building which really helps your early game with more science and faith especially if you settle lots of cities.  If you really like domination though you NEED to try out Arabia.  Camel archers are INSANE maybe the best unit in the game.  Mongolian Keshiks are pretty much the only land unit that can even compete.  Camel archers can move up shoot then retreat to avoid getting attacked.  The accumulate experience because they never die and pretty soon youve got extra range and the ability to attack twice a turn.  Enemy cities and units will fall like flies before them.  Toplevel players use camel archers to conquer entire standardsize maps before turn  on standard speed!  Yeah theyre a little OP.,civ,crexfse,6,t5_2rk3b

4101410,0,t3_37h9a7,Heres a few ideas  that I think would be pretty ground breaking if pulled offAI that can beat you without cheating.IIRC this would be the first civ game to be able to do so. Im not going to pretend I know HOW to acheive this except to say that the splitbrained nature of the civ  AI has to go. At the very least the subbrains need to communicate with each other andor report to a mother brain. There should be a brain to recognise synergies and advantages. The AI should plan for things like a production city if their second city has a mountain assuming observatories dont change then they should consider putting national college there again assuming it remains the same. The designers should look at how humans exploit the game and TEACH THE AIs TO DO IT TOO EVEN IF IT MEANS PATCHING THEM POST RELEASE WHEN THE META IS FORMED.Intelligent diplomacy.You should be able to tell or bargain with AIs to get away from your territory warnaskbribe them not to settle a particular area not just near me make threatspromises and trade anything that is currently already traded for any of these things. AIs should recognise aggressors. I liked the casus beli idea someone had transitioning into UN resolutions in later eras. When war breaks out AIs should decide for themselves who is right and hold those opinions throughout the game coloring their later decisions and opinions. AIs should have proper tactical awareness and the ability to predict how a battle will go plan an attack and carry it out. A Deity AI should be as much of a threat as a player. EG if the huns were to remain the same mechanically not that they necessarily shouldnot then Attilla should plan for a battering ram rush and execute on it immediately if he gets one in a ruin. RANGED UNITS SHOULD BLOODY WELL MOVE AND SHOOT. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ITS . CIV AI SUCKS. FIX IT. BLAMO NEW GAME.Free TradeInstead of trading resources diplomatically resources mainly go through trade routes. Instead of having trade units run laps for X turns have each trade unit add a slot  to the trade screen where the player can set base prices for their resources and opt inout of purchasing other players resources. Each trade route can only buysell resources produced in the destinationsource city and can be reassigned at any time. If another player wants a resource where supply outstrips demand they can bid the price up taking over trading for that resource with that city. The previous buyer gets a notification like the current city state influence ones. Trading diplomatically would be done at a worse rate as it bypasses the free market to ensure guaranteed supply.I also think smaller tiles would be cool. Give units more movement and vision cram more tiles into each map size. Maybe cities could sprawl as Tutule suggests.,civ,crnsb1e,3,t5_2rk3b

I had dominated the continent I started on thanks to finidng Solomons Mine first and immediately settling it then capturing a city which had settled Lake Victoria.  I adventure over to the other continent and find that Mongolia had eliminated the Ottomans reduced Korea to one sad tundra city captured  CS and basically turned the largest landmass on the map into his exclusive playground filled with Keshiks.  I embark a force to begin my effort to eliminate him and managed to capture a recently settled Mongolian city on the southern coast.  Even though this war was not going to win me the game directly I knew that it was going to decide that game if I win I can cruise to a domination or science win.  If he defeats me then it will only be a matter of time until he rebuilds and finishes me off.He throws his entire continent of troops at that city.  There was a  turn stretch where the city was reduced to  HP but thanks to a river and hill he could never get a melee unit into position to capture before I could kill it.  Finally I transport and purchase enough troops to halt the seige.  I then beeline for the nearest occupied Ottoman city and liberate it.  Stupidly he doesnt declare war on the Ottomans and Im able to use their territory to heal some units and then attack him with him only being able to use ranged units to respond.  Once I liberated that city the war was over.  I purchase several soontobe gatling Xbows in my foothold city and then launch a pincer attack from the foothold and Ottoman territory.  The two pincers meet up at Beshbalik leaving a trail of Spanish citadels in their wake.  By the time I was accepting Genghis surrender and taking all of his luxuries and GPT in the process I had a dozen  range gatling guns  Cover and Medic II riflemen  blitzing Cavalry and a fleet of frigates with logistics.

You built a lighthouse and harbor in a city with only  sea resources? Why not just throw your hammers in the ocean? And then you didnt build a seaport? I mean if youre going that far why stop? I guess you really like paying maintenance on roads you dont need since you didnt tear them all up after you got harbors.

If it was once controlled by another civ you improve relations with that civ. Regardless of who owns it liberation can help you become less of a warmonger in the eyes of other civs if you previously were taking cities.If you annex a city you control every aspect of it what buildings it makes and whatnot after it gets out of resistance phase. This should be done when you think the city will actually be useful to you but it create a lot of unhappiness.If you puppet a city there is less unhappiness but you dont control what the city does. Sometimes it is smart to puppet a city and annex it later if you think unhappiness will be too much to carry initially. then of course you can always raze a city to the ground. MwahahahahaSimply put liberate if you dont want the city and you dont want warmonger penalties. Raze if you dont want the city and dont care about other civs thoughts.

Different tiles have different production values so it depends on the terrain. Theres a button on the lower right that will show all tiles yield. If a city is surrounded by hills you probably want farms on the flat tiles and mines on the hills to create a production city. build forge  barracks. If a city is coastal or manly plainsgrassfloodplains and rivers you want cottages to create a sciencegold city. marketplace  library. I dont find workshops very efficient unless you plan to adopt the state property civic. Watermills are nice.Infrastructure i assume you mean improved tiles dont cost money so its no problem to build as much as you can. But a city can only work tiles within its fatcross the  tiles around youre city. No matter how much cultural spread you have. So theres no point in improving those tiles. except roads. Unless there are resources on them sheep iron etc so you get access to them.

But the worst thing about him is his god damned CS allies. He honestly has  more influence than me on some of them... I got so annoyed with him after his most recent war I liberated the Aztec cities and nuked Athens. Im very very close to winning a cultural victory now.Really the only way to deal with this asshole is to war him. Its very very hard to overcome his influence on CS especially when the AI is on higher difficulties and has tons of cash.

The reason youre getting DoWd is undoubtedly because youre forward settling the AIs  they really do not like that.  Settle fewer cities andor dont stray as far from your capitol.  The less land you occupy the less land you have for the AI to covet and the fewer cities you have the easier it is to defend them.  Max out tradition settle four cities  hexes apart get construction and put walls  composite bowmen in every city.  Thats a good start.Theres a time and place for everything piety included but unless youre using a civ that works well with piety ICS and going for  cities I dont see a reason to waste policies on that tree.Tithe is a great added bonus but depending on it for gold isnt a viable strategy.

Every  turns the civ with a unit on the tile gets control  but hypothetically it could continue loke this forever. The only thing stopping this from being exploitable is that your relations with the civ you are skirmishing with would get sour after even one skirmish making two skirmishes in a row a easy way to piss the AI off.I see peace treaties for real wars to be similar. You make peace treaties and make peace but you can declare war again anytime you like.

This is especially overpowerd if you realise that you will get most of these works through conquest.  tourism is a lot in the early game especially when great people dont cost much and you dont make a lot of culture yet. The extra exp is whatever and comes to late to really matter due to the music slot. The polish UB is regarded really good. This one also gives a tile bonus but does even more. The individual bonuses seem oke but everything stacked make it really powerfull. The UU does things workers should have done long ago and gives a bonus you had expect on a UB. Instead of having a ranged unit in your city you now have this cavalry which is less than optimal. They also have nothing that makes me wanna go like I want to use those guys in war.   Edit the  bonus tourism seems really overpowerd especially if you think about that indias UB gives only  flat tourism that it needs a work of music also doesnt matter because you only need them in yuor high culture cities.

While they can be turned on to be accessed in a normal game they are all either bugged or poorlyimplimented in one way or another for purposes of a normal game and only really work well in a scenario environment.Making the No Religion option available and turning it on only kinda works. A player can still get great prophets via policies for example. And none of the faithgenerating buildings are disabled. So even though you cannot accumulate Faith you can still build Shrines and Temples  and the AI promptly proceeds to do so. The only really reliable way to turn off religion is to start play in the Industrial Era. Starting in the Industrial Era also turns off Shrines and Temples and certain World Wonders because they are set to be unbuildable ingame if the player starts later than the Renaissance Era.Always War causes all players to always be at war with one another. But this includes CityStates. With this option turned on and while running a normal game you will still see AI players sending trade routes to each other even though they are locked into perpetual war with each other.

Boost your tourism output so that you will pressure them back. Next time you do Autocracy I highly recommend taking Futurism as the first tenet.. Boost your happiness to soak up ideology pressure. Autocracy is particularly good at this. You should pick up Militarism happiness from barracks armories and military academies and build Prora in a coastal city.

I still prefer Civ  oder Civ BE because it simply is the better strategy game mainly because it offers more features and mechanics More factions Religion The World Congress More victory conditions that do not feel all the same More policy choices and more possible resulting play styles Ideologies which feel more meaningful to me than BE Affinities because you choose them based on your strategy and situation and not based on what strategic resource you start close to. Ideologies are way more impactful on the development of the game as well. Keep in mind that comparing Civ   addons to vanilla Civ BE might be a bit unfair though.

With the civics you can change throughout the game which makes it much more dinamic. Bur more important the civics can actually be used to replicate forms of government that civilizations had throughout history. Social Policies dont reflect any of that. They had to add ideologies later to connect in some form with real history but even those have benefits that dont really reflect they counterparts in reality. CIV was always a game that tried to rewrite history but based in the real evolution of civilizations.

The remaining DLC is very cheap and just adds additional civs so it is not mandatory although mostly nowadays the game comes in a complete edition pack with all DLC including the expansions and its often on sale for about .Edit Also they didnt split the base game into DLC not really. The features added by the expansions in Civ are so completely different compared to Civ that you cannot consider them to be related other than name. In Civ for example religion is a relatively minor bonus to your culture and something you have somewhat limited influence over. Religion in Civ is much much more empowering and important and you have more control over how you spread your religion and whether you want to or not is a complicated discussion since your opponents get some of your own bonuses.,civ,cvoyaz0,1,t5_2rk3b

Although Keals guide is a bit outdated see here to start with on how to create a mod Derek Keal Paxtons Original HowTo for CIV modding. create the mod. See here for a bit more updated information on creating an empty new mod. You need to create the art file for the wonder splash screen and then convert it to dds format. Most programs like Gimp paint etc. have plugins for dds conversion. When converting the file from a jpg or whathaveyou into a dds file different programs Gimp as opposed to Paint seem to have a different setting for the compressionrate required to convert to a ddstype file that CIV will recognize. Unfortunately I am not expert enough in artfile creation to give moredirect help than that.. The pixeldimensions of a wonder splash screen need to meet wide x high Icon and Screen Pixel Dimension Reference . When the art file is completed and converted into dds format add it to the mod as explained here. You must set the ImportIntoVFS property for the file to true as explained and demonstrated here. Create a new xmlfile by using the fileadding procedure in step  except you use the new item choice instead of the existing item choice and then in the next menu you select to add a new XMLfile.. do as shown here for the XMLfile Setting an xml or sql file to update the game database. edit the xml file to contain    ltGameDatagt    ltBuildingsgt     ltUpdategt    ltWhere TypeBUILDINGCHICHENITZAgt     ltSetgt    ltWonderSplashImagegtYourReplacementSplashScreenFilesNameHere.ddsltWonderSplashImagegt     ltSetgt    ltUpdategt    ltBuildingsgt    ltGameDatagt.

This creates a usable copy of the mod and places it into the games MODS folder where you can enable it through the MODS menu and use the mod in gameplay. Some people think they need to upload a mod to the Steam Workshop and then subscribe and download it in order to use a mod they make for themselves. This is not true.

Later on I would build a navy of no more than  frigates and melee ships followed by the same number of bombers and fighters. Most of the time you should be devoting your time to infrastructure. The key here is to preserve all your units since depending on how many wars you get into your elite corps of former archers catapults and warriors can gain promotions such as March and Logistics making them into very tough machine guns artillery and infantry while getting rid of the need to build waves of units whenever you are gonna invade or defend yourself. ,civ,cwgkcne,9,t5_2rk3b

If she is your neighbor     Shes always going to go Liberty. Its not a random Morocco Piety or Liberty situation unless you adjust winning conditions or random personalities shes going Liberty.    Solution Attempt to pin her in with your own forward settle. This will piss her off but also prevents her from settling  legit cities before she inevitably adopts Order. Pissed to the point shes likely going to attack you which leads to...     Double Horses. Shes likely going to come at you with a cavalry moreso than anything else. Spam archers and spearmen and pikemen surround your cities especially the ones pinning her in with these guys or on your borders in general backed up by your archers. Fortify. Heal.    Remember the old trick ranged units cant take cities. Take out her melee and cavalry first.     Get allies. Pay them to attack. This chick is going WIDE unless you stop her.

5628721,0,t3_3s5mih,I was also a big starcraft player and in terms of variety heres what Ive noticedCivilizationsraces Starcraft has . Civ has  that each play like a race in Starcraft in certain ways prioritization mechanics leveraged personality. Mods can add a ton more civs and personalities can be randomized. Maps When I was playing SC one issue I had was running the same maps constantly. Most civ players use randomly generated maps which means no two games are the same. Diplomacy Yes the diplomacy system in Civ is not ideal. But it adds depth to a game where in SC its like playing with permawar mode on. Victory conditions Starcraft is really a single victory type military. Civ has  victory types cultural diplomatic domination science and time. This means that not all civs in a game are working towards the same goal  a fundamental difference. I think this adds depth and complexity to the game. Mods This is the big one for me. Ive played upwards of  hours mostly with mods which can do anything from more conveniently displaying data thats usually hidden somewhere Enhanced User Interface InfoAddict to fully changing fundamental elements of the game superpower community call to power and even adding new mechanics corporations events and decisions. If you beat civ with every victory type  with every civ  on every difficulty level  you can start using mods like rd and th unique component and Civ  leader traits in Civ  to enhance each civ and go through again. AI As people have already mentioned the A I for each civ is different. It can also be tweaked with the community balance patch and mods like focused AI. For me I prefer civ to SC because I prefer to be able to think out a decision for a minute rather than having to keep my APM high to be competitive. Of course YMMV.

5636273,0,t3_3s9x6a,I feel rivers can serve an important tactical purpose mainly as they can slow down an invading army. A city built adjacent to a river makes it more defensible against any attacker trying to attack from the other side. The notion of sending warships updown rivers can be complicated as it would be feasible until you enter the Modern Era as ships get larger. Alternatively for trade routes sending a cargo ship updown rivers would be feasible until a similar time frame. For reference on the Mississippi River the furthest port upstream capable of handling Panamax ships is Baton Rouge LA. Thats not terribly far upstream.The notion of dams and reservoirs would be complicated and difficult to implement. Since rivers run on the edge of tiles and not through them how do you choose which tile gets the lakereservoir? Destroying dams becomes a morally ambiguous area because of the presumably high civilian casualties it would cause on any city below the dam. Theres a reason why Civ V doesnt have a terrorism mechanic nor does it have chemical and biological weapons. I think the develops said they like to avoid those morally gray areas as much as they can. ,civ,cwvqew0,3,t5_2rk3b

5738211,0,t1_cx89ki2,Are you serious? Catapult is an early game unit. Its a fucking classical era unit. Sure it upgrades to artillery later on which is fucking amazing but thats much much later into the game. Your logic is so flawed and youre contradicting yourself heavily that its not even funny. First of all you dont build a unit thinking that its gonna be uselessuseful  eras in the future. By the same flawed logic you shouldnt build spearmanpikeman cause it upgrades to LancerATgun which is crap. By the same flawed logic you should build warriorswordsmanlongswordsman as well because it upgrades to Infantry later on right? Its stupid and it doesnt make sense.Secondly CB upgrades to a notsogreat gatling gun sure but up till late renaissance CBXB line is actually the primary ranged units for war. Cannon is probably the first siege units that are quite decent but only at taking cities. When defending I actually prefer XBGatling Gun. I dont know what difficulty youre playing at but at deity the AI spam a lot of units making CB the obvious choice vs catapult.Last but not least you mentioned that taking CB deviates from Civil Service and its true. But it also gives you access to colosseum. Its well worth the cost. Now look at the siege lines. Cannon is in Chemistry which is awkward. You dont want to open renaissance through gunpowder. Its just bad. You want to open it from AcousticsBankingPrinting Press depending on if youre aiming for Scientific Theory or Industrialization. Getting dynamite is even worse not because the unit itself is bad cause its not. Its because you have to deviate so much from Plastics that its not worth it if youre not going to war especially if you were just beelining the top tree and havent unlocked most of the bottom tree just yetSteelGunpowderetc.,civ,cx8dqfv,2,t5_2rk3b

Point is its worth deviating from the ideal science tech route to get better units. Your late game is useless if you get rekt early game because catapult isnt as good for defending or you get slowed down cause you need to build more catapults to handle the AIs units as opposed to CBXB. gtYou are misunderstanding my recommendation of catapults. I am not saying you build them as culture or science. As culture or science pikes are my army. not my stopgap until I get to another unit thats all I make. A couple pikes. And then maybe some great war bombers or submarines or  free foreign legion or something.I am not. Youre just skipping many things here. Pikeman comes at medieval and spearmanpikeman are just terrible at defending. You mentioned before well I just build spearmanpikeman to deter AI attacks.

Spain as a country was formed almost  years later. The Moors firmly controlled almost the entire Iberian peninsula as an extention of their own empire in Africa. He was born as a Moor within he Moorish empire. State of Liberty has always been owned and controlled by America. Alhambra was the last bastion of the Moors and Leon Castille never managed to break it. It was handed over when they surrendered. Still to this day the Moors have controlled Alhambra for a longer period of time than the christians have up to this date.I actually went on a  hour guided trip to Alhambra Ill recommend this as the most interesting historical place I have ever been to and they did regard it as Moorish themselves.,civ,cxq5ge7,6,t5_2rk3b

5985301,0,t1_cy4646v,I really dont think I am. Tradition gets its gold from monarchy sure. but it also gets its gold from free monuments  gold per turn reduced maintenance of troops often  gold per turn and this just snowballs very very quickly. I often get  gold per turn income  on turn  as tradition. This just doesnt happen for liberty because I cannot rush buy the spears to steal workers I cannot rush buy the workers to improve tiles I cannot rush buy the tiles to improve.  gold net income just requires a whole lot of improved luxuries being sold to the AIs not used to maintain happiness in a large empire. I dont actually agree that production is better than gold for getting an army. Army units are actually some of the most efficient things in the game in terms of conversion rate between gold and hammers.  Gold is a lot less valuable  for  than hammers but it actually makes more sense to funnel your gold to units than to buildings.Also for strategic resource units Every turn you spend building a unit is  gold per turn. If you spend  turns pumping out a horseman? thats  gold. Right there in a resource you couldnt sell to the AI. interestingly enough strategics are perfectly exchangable you can both buy and sell them for  gold per turn due to AI rounding errors. Furthermore buying units lets you get them and immediately use them which both increases the size of your timing window but also reduces army maintenace. Every turn you have a unit that you built but are not yet using is  gold per turn. If you add all this leakage up you see that even if military units were slightly less efficient than buildings the savings from upkeep increased timing windows  and the savings from strategic resource costs would make them preferrable. But they ARENT slightly less efficient they are more efficent. Of course you cannot just rush buy an entire army but the more of it you can rush buy the better off you will be. And what you cannot rush buy its much more advantageous to build it very quickly in a small number of cities than relatively slowly in a large number of cities. I suspect my vast preference for tradition domination over liberty domination is partly my playstyle but I think its also just that tradition provides more of EVERYTHING and in a more centralized package which I think is easily underestimated. I also think expansions get up and running faster for tradition because you can just rush buy so much. My current game its turn . My second city has a production of  a food income of . and I have been fighting a war at it for  turns preventing me from improving key tiles. Why? because I rush bought a stable rush bought a water mill and rush bought the caravan moving into it.  By turn  It will be kicking out a companion cavalry every  turns out of a barracks. Why? because while  production is great so is just dropping  gold on infrastructure that arrives RIGHT NOW and lets you build other infrastructure more quickly. Edit Actually sparta ended up beating my prediction. I finished the barracks on turn  and started pumping more than  production per turn into companion cavalry immediately after as well as providing  faith per turn from a holy site. Thats under  turns already.,civ,cy47dc7,1,t5_2rk3b

The war was bloody and thousands died. The famous first part of the war was referred to as the scourge of Brazil. Those filthy infidels deserved what we gave them they were harassing our Indonesian friends for too long. Along with their spies in our cities our conflict seemed justified. We had the upper hand thanks to the recently discovered artillery. We left no survivors. Upon doing this the world plunged into global war. On the other side of the planet Germany sought the world War as a method to expand they annexed Byzantium China Venice and Greece. Meanwhile in my homeland the Zulu aggressive commenced. Years prior the Zulu had  invaded our Polynesian brothers. Our war against the Zulu and Poland was not out of autocratic rage but liberation. The Zulu were wiped from the face of the earth Polynesia liberated but now serving as a puppet nation. Poland Was wiped from the face of the earth by nuclear hellfire. This extermination was justified for the past thousand years the Polish scum had been harassing my city state allies. The year is  only three civs remain. Arabia Germany and puppet Polynesia. As the new seat for the UN was opened Arabia took it amongst themselves to fill that void. The German people full under the influence of our supreme leader and dozens of cities were renamed in his honour.

6087901,0,t3_3yxc08,NO not every tile should be worked. generally you should have enough workers to roughly pace the growth rate of your city so that as your city acquires citizens the improvements finish.I would say the important thing to do is maximize total value. This USUALLY means that you build farms. Specializing tiles is rarely worth doing outside of the extreme early game simply because your city will need both food and production so you can usually shift your focus as much as you want through just slightly shifting your tile yields. You really dont need more than  solely production focused tile if you arent starvation building settlers and simply maximizing total value will usually give you all the food you need anyways. Why do you build farms? well I generally think that in the earlymidgame gold is probably worth  of a food or production unit. This means that you basically never build early trading posts because they give you  of the total value of any other improvement. So its farms versus mines and lumber mills. Trading posts are usually placed on jungles and the idea behind that is that you were working the tile anyways for the science and might as well get the gold also. but mainly trading posts are late game improvement except for jungle tiles. Science is worth quite a bit more than gold So I would say that  science is probably worth  gold per turn in rough terms. Farms are the best early game improvement to build because civil service makes any fresh water accessed farm oasis lake or river adjacent adds  food once you get the earlygame tech civil service whereas a mine lumber mill or pasture adds  productionfood only after you get the lategame techs chemistry and scientific method.Really I dont recommend specializing tiles in the mid and late game I recommend maximizing total value instead. If its a freshwater tile try to build a farm. If its not a freshwater tile try to build a mine. If you are scientific theory try to build lumber mills you will get scientific theory long before you get chemistry. If you are domination try to build mines instead of lumber mills. But the overall guiding principles If you have a  pop city you want to be working  improved tiles and improving the th  When you consider what tiles to work gold is worth about  as much as production. If the tile has fresh water you want to try to build a farm on it. If the tile does not have fresh water you want to try and mine or lumber mill it and if you cant do that you want to plant an academy on it. ,civ,cyhloss,1,t5_2rk3b

6091530,0,t1_cyhz21m,Well I have experience on no difficulty other than deity. However the way I see it you either take damage when attacking or when defending. Horsemen never have to defend because they can pull back out of range and they kill stuff so quickly. They also take damage but they heal faster than any other unit in the game as you can pillage a lot of tiles very quickly as well as retreating back into safe healing spots after fighting. Composites are probably less effective on deity because the AI gets to the point that they can one shot units earlier. I find you really have to have a dedicated unit whos job is either to die or not die depending on your strategy so your compositessiege dont have to. Incidentally knights are great at this because as mentioned they heal quickly have very high base combat strength and can safely retreat from danger even in rough terrain when injured.I think melee fighting is a lot more complex. You need to really well  understand zones of control but you also need to understand flanking bonuses. Isolating enemy units and then overwhelming them is very important to deity melee warfare and preventing the enemy from doing the same to you is a matter of success or failure. Overall though I will admit crossbows are probably about on par if not slightly more powerful than knights. But cavalry are MASSIVELY superior to gatlings and things only get more extreme as the game goes on. A horseman is an investment in the future. Sure it can earn a lot of money from pillaging tiles killing barbarian camps and stealing workers. But really what you are doing is farming experience on the most important unit in the game to have promotions on. The cavalry unitlandship. ,civ,cyi1l2k,2,t5_2rk3b

If you have some units that can quickly be upgraded to something more formidable if someone declares war to make them rethink an invasion thats not a bad idea. Other than that hire your rivals to waste their military resources on one another through endless orchestrated distant wars that keep your own country free of invasion.   If you have to get into a war because of an encroaching city give the city to a tall ally. They will love you and yet it will screw up their progress and your enemy will hate them rather than you. Everybody loses except you!   Also make nukes if you can but again avoid using them unless you need to push one of the other civs down right before your own win. ,civ,cyicn4m,3,t5_2rk3b

It helps to play civs with early UU so they dont become obsolete by the time you reach your enemie with your army. You can try that mod.I agree with what others said war is investment and when you go to war you should know why you do it. Keep only good cities with unique luxuries wonders but mostrly those are in capitals strategic geographical places or for future gifts to other civs. Raze others even puppeting hurts you a lot in happiness and keeps you out from your expantion and sell buildings in them you can sell  building per turn. dont kill civ entirely. More cities you capture combined with total kill will raise you warmonger score to the skies. So going to war it is not only managing your happiness and unit costs but also warmonger points and the last one cause other civ to denouce and finally dow you. You can capture a capital and take second city via peace deal and razegift it after. War dividents should be bigger than what youll get in peacfull play new fertile lands good capital cities more luxuries. All those you can convert in better economy and science than remained civs. Mostly AI dont like warmongers and denoucedow you some civs dont like warmongers direclty others dont like you because you want to win the way they planned. But warmonger score spread only on your continent if you dont know civs from other one. So you can wipe all of them on your continent and upon meeting civs from other continent they wont know you are a mean bustard that slaughtered half of the continent. also it is good to know when you go to war and against what civ. it is hard to have an army and money in treasury but you can bribe someone to go to war against one civ and go to war with another. This way on the continent will be  warmongers. Also try to use classical rule came from ancient Rome devide and rule.

Avoid capturing other cities by force. Receiving cities by trade does not count towards warmonger penalty. Trade with city states. They dont care about your warmonger penalty.

If you look at Civ IV the financial trait was the closest analogue to scientific prowess since it gave you  extra commerce on any tile with  or more which could then be leveraged into extra science spending. But you still had to work and adjust your strategy to take advantage of it trying to get ahold of as many tiles as possible which naturally had  commerce or failing that maximizing Cottage revenue and even then it wasnt so commanding that you were two entire eras ahead of your contemporaries by the midgame.Civ III actually had a Scientific leader trait but it still wasnt overblown. You had a slightly easier time of generating Scientific Great Leaders which first required you to be the first to reach a tech and then it was still  chance at best which could pay dividends later in the game. You also got one free tech on advancing to a new era which is nice but Civ  only has  eras and the tech tree is big. So Civ s Scientific rewarded you for playing well by allowing you to further your advantage into a respectable lead but you had to be the one to create that advantage in the first place.But Civ Vs just like here you want oodles of free science for the entire game?

Easy win with the extra Pantheon rush Shrine in all cities pick Piety opener after Legalism or Collective rule and snowball with your religion.Playing multiplayer? Make your opponent cry as they are unable to stop you from spreading your religion with Religious Text  Itinerant Preachers and use your Dromon and Cataphract for protection against early invasion.Playing Immortal or Deity? Pick an other Civ unless you want a big challenge.Byzantium is a high riskhigh reward Civ. The only condition is to get a Religion early enough and you are good. The fact that their UU come early means that the only way to stop you from snowballing is to pick a Religion before you.gt Can they withstand Gandhi?Easily Gandhi is not an expansionnist so you should not have trouble to pick a Religion before him until Immortal ofc. Even if a player use him it is hard to settle lots of city with Gandhi early. His War Elephant are dangerous but unlocking Cataphract is not too hard and they should not have trouble killing them.

I always feel the Dutch are severely underrated as a Civ because a decent polder start can put you way ahead in every respect but its not necessary. Their real power lies in sea beggars. They start out with three free upgrades so if you build them in a city with barracks and armoury you can immediately give them logistics right out of the gate this may also require military academy unsure. Generally I get the tech fairly early and then build them nonstop until Im forced to get the destroyer tech. I may war with them in this time I may not it depends. But with correct placement and logistics Ive managed to attack with as many as  sea beggars on a single city in one turn because logistics also allows you to retreat after your second attack plus the added bonus of randomly taking enemy ships as cannon fodder. Ive used this strategy to great effect in the past but in this particular game I got a shitty ocean start and basically abandoned any concept of a navy.,civ,czl9pyw,1,t5_2rk3b

We share no borders and in fact are quite far away from each other so I decide why not in past games Ive played when a civ has asked me to declare war on another one I have and then the civ Ive declared war on despite me not attacking any of their units or anything has given me cities as peace offering.

The biggest areas this stands out are in combat and making deals. Ive defeated armies  times my owns size because they end up milling about in the jungle tiles for a half dozen more turns than they needed to outside my city. Thats something they could fix without nixing flavor. Additionally too many civs lose a city then give away ANOTHER key city in a bid for peace that effectively makes them irrelevant to the game. Combine that with a granular approach to deals reputation breakpoints for value of goods and people can game them to their own advantage. They dont seem cognizant of the urgent need a player might have for a luxury for example. Put more simply AIs are vending machines right now for luxes. When they plot against you its hardly plotting at all. Thats something they could also fix.

Once you merge several mods together into one mod you should never have any of the original mods enabled at the same time as the merged mod.. Also since the mod updating system on Steam works based on mod IDs the merged mod will not be seen as being the same as any of the content merged into the One Larger Mod by the Steam ModUpdate system in any way. If you unsubscribe from the original mods you will never know that an update has been made to CivilizationX that you merged into your One Larger Mod.,civ,d0bxelp,2,t5_2rk3b

Or alternatively play on King difficulty to test the waters of AI advantages up to you.Next up for you would be to play on Immortal difficulty. At that level the AIs advantage is rather significant but isnt as downright ridiculous as as on Deity where the AI can have four times the advantage over you.Personally I wouldnt rush to play on Deity.

7111666,0,t3_4cutrk,Polynesias a fun Civ to mess around with and is the only one to really make the most of all the Exploration Social Policies thanks to their coastalcultural playstyle. OP already linked my full guide but heres a few assorted tricks for the Civ Use your early embarking ability to scout out good city locations. The best spots for Moai are islands or peninsulas which are two tiles thick and at least three tiles long. Your UA gives a strength bonus to your units if near a Moai but the Moai in question doesnt even need to be in your lands  useful if you lost a city and want to take it back. The strength bonus for Moai proximity is determined based on where your units are not what theyre attacking. A Moai in range of a city where aircraft are based will give all those planes the  bonus. Moai yields are influenced by adjacent Moai even if they cannot be worked. As a consequence the ring of tiles outside the workable radius of a city should be taken into consideration when aiming to maximise culture yields. Moai can be built directly on marshlands without removing them useful if you want to save time building a Moai which wont itself be worked and on resource tiles unlike most other unique improvements. Despite all this good stuff about Moai dont go crazy building too many too soon. Until later in the game when Flight adds gold and Hotels and Airports add tourism food and production will generally be higher priorities. The Haka War Dance promotion unfortunately doesnt make the victim more susceptible to ranged attacks. It also doesnt work on naval or air units which wouldnt make a whole lot of sense. However a Maori Warrior upgraded via Ancient Ruins to a Spearman can be upgraded all the way to a Helicopter Gunship with the Haka War Dance promotion which makes even less sense. Outside of Pangaea maps Polynesia is usually the first to discover all other Civs. Rushing to Printing Press will ensure you can be the first host of the World Congress. If you can save a Great Engineer to rush the Forbidden Palace you can give yourself such a lead in delegates you can just keep pushing for decisions that give you more e.g. World Religion. Combined with the extra gold from Moai later in the game which can be used to bribe CityStates with Polynesia isnt half bad at diplomatic victories if culture wont work out.,civ,d1mhuu4,63,t5_2rk3b

7162203,0,t1_d1s9h6o,You underestimate how poor quality Linear Congruential RNGs are. Wikipedia has an excellent gif showing the results of generating random points in D space using an LC RNG where you can easily see how the RNG tends to generate certain numbers over others. Their advantages are that they are easy to program and run fast but because these advantages are also shared by Linear Feedback Shift Register RNGs which also tend to be a much higher quality LC RNGs have been replaced with LFSR RNGs in almost all speedsensitive programs except for games. I suspect familiarity is the only reason theyre still used in games as timestrapped developers would rather stick with something tried and known to produce satisfactory results than try to mess around with something with which theyre not as familiar. That said even LFSRs have a fairly poor quality so wherever fast generation isnt as much of an issue youll find slower but vastly higher quality RNGs like Mersenne Twisters.I actually tried messing around with swapping Civs RNG to a Mersenne Twister a couple months back but I ran into serious issues with multiplayer specifically syncing the internal state of the RNG. While an LC RNG and an LFSR RNG have a single bit integer seed as their internal state a Mersenne Twister has an array of bit integers plus a pointer as its internal state and getting Civs engine to play nice with bit integers proved to be too much of a pain.,civ,d1s9v31,3,t5_2rk3b

7327389,0,t3_4fq26s,. Early game wonders ancient and classical era arent vital for a cultural win but there are many that will definitely help. Stonehenge for the religion and more specifically the Parthenon will give you that early culturetourism edge. The most important buildings for culture victory by far are the guilds writers artists and musicians. There are some wonders further along that are more vital but not getting them are never insurmountable like the Sistine Chapel Alhambra Broadway etc basically buildings that have great work slots since near the Endgame this might be quite a bottleneck.  . The most important thing is to discover the other civs as early as possible since you wont be sending any tourism to civs you havent discovered. Another important thing to remember is that a cultural victory becomes harder the more cities you have. Since Tradition has the most synergy on  cities thats what I usually stick to.  Also either get those monuments up or go for the Free culture building Policy in the Tradition tree early the  great people generation boost from the national epic is a neat little earlygame boost to grab up those great writers faster. finally this may be personal preference but I feel a concert from a great musician is never worth it especially early in the game.  . If you can fit it in try to get some Piety policies in there too theres a reformation thingy that gives your faith buildings pagodas mosques monasteries etc  tourism each! its really neat.  . ....I got nothing I really dont like playing as Spain or the Mayans so I cant really tell you anything from personal experience.  . Like I said Religion is pretty damn handy especially when you get lucky with your resources. have wine or incense? get yourself some monasteries and Goddess of Festivals pantheon for some sweet culture and faith!  for your founder belief theres really no other choice than Tithe and theres no real alternative that would be more beneficial for a culture victory. For your follower belief the buildings are the best.   first follower belief either Monasteries if you have abovementioned resources otherwise Pagodas which is the most balanced of the bunch.  second follower belief Cathedrals if you find yourself with more great artists than you can expend. otherwise Mosques for the extra happiness which will feed into your culture with one of those Aesthetics Policies.  World Religion is handy when you want the game to finish a bit earlier. Not having it isnt a disaster though World Ideology is more important imo since differing ideologies cause a  to your tourism output. However your already quite influential culture will eventually force the other ideologies into submission with unhappiness and revolts!  I recommend turning off a Time victory by the way. more than once have I found myself thwarted a couple of turns away from victory only to see Hiawatha run off with a time victory because he has settled  fuckin cities and has a massive score lead because of it.  . Definitely. In fact in the late game the Autocracy ideology is my goto culture victory ideology followed by freedom. It gives you insane happiness if youve built defense buildings and unit XP buildings and theres a tenet called Futurism that gives you a  tourism bomb on every known civ whenever a great writerartistmusician is born.  also one of the rdtier tenets gives you a  tourism boost to civs with which you are fighting against a common foe.  Finally when your culture is influential over a warmongering civ which will probably happen pretty quickly their units will have a disadvantage against yours since their citizens dont want to fight against their dominant culture.General handy things to know  for some reason I always find myself ahead in pretty much everything when going for a culture victory. I always have time to build barracksarmoriesmil.academies and units which never hurts to have.  dont forget to micromanage your great work placement! Those building bonuses and great work swapping are pretty vital to your success!  Cultural victories have a very slow start but ramp up really big once you get around to the modern era. For a most of the other victories this is the point where you cant really do much more in terms of building up your own civ to increase your chances of winning.  However in a cultural victory this is the point where your earlygame investments start paying off. Airports and Hotels really increase your tourism almost exponentially. The National Visitors Centre and the Internet tech are pretty vital too.  If you played optimally dont be surprised to see youre generating over  culture and tourism per turn its pretty crazy.  Finally imo going for culture victory is the most lenient you will realise pretty early on when youre not hitting that stride you need to ramp up in the late game and because of that you can switch over to going for other victories pretty early.

The nerf to wide science output killed wide.   cities or less hits the end of the tech tree first and also is less of a happiness burden if playing domination while wide may be better in the long run but like I said elsewhere in the thread the long run happens after the game has ended.I will go out of my way to play widefavoring civs like Rome and Maya and go out of my way to build wide but you can only enjoy shooting yourself in the foot so much.  Building cities yourself is not worth it because of concerns like national wonders and slowing down key infrastructure.  The best strategy on deity is to build tall and either turtle to Science or diplo victory capture cities and then attack a runaway to keep them from beating you to a sciencediplo victory or build tall to widetall and capture mostly capitals and raze most other cities to get a Domination victory.Freedom seems better in theroy for tall but order is better when you crunch the numbers even when on  cities.

7479989,0,t1_d2s42ij,Penalty is purely diplomatic.The reason you dont want a diplomatic penalty for warmongering is that it makes AIs far more likely to declare war on you and they start to stiff you in trade deals reducing the amount of goldluxeries you can get in trade reducing your money and happiness which are hardly things in plentiful supply when warmongering.  It also makes it very hard to establish a declaration of friendship with people that havent already established one with you and existing friends can let their DoFs lapse or they can break them although this doesnt happen as quickly making trades for lump sums of gold and research agreements impossible.  Less happiness and less research agreements pretty directly impacts science which is one of the most important aspects of civ.You can look up the details of warmonger penalty but generally but quick and dirty rules of thumb are smaller map  less cities overall  less cities belonging to target civ  more warmonger penalty per city.  You get a decent chunk of warmonger penalty just from declaring war but most of it comes from capturing cities even capturing cities after somebody declared war on you.  Some civs care more about warmongering than others generally the more a civilization seems like warmongering dicks the less they care the more they seem like peacemongering hippies the more they care.The easiest way to overcome warmonger penalty is to keep wars small scale early game maybe just taking a valuable capital and leaving the rest of an empire alone to keep everybody moderately happy with you.  Then later game usually after you hit ideologies diplomatic relations tend to break down anyways because of the effects of ideology and trades account for a much smaller slice of your gold  happiness.  So at that point you can kick war into high gear and just let diplomatic relations break down.  You dont have to do things this way some people win the game by conquest by the medieval era and piss off their neighbours from the ancient era but its the simplest approach.  War can be an extremely profitable venture where you make  units and take  wonders and an awesome city with tons of improvements and population or an extremely unprofitable one where you spend a ton on unitsunit maintenance and get no cities or shabby ones that werent really worth it and the entire world starts embargoing you.It is important to note you do not get warmonger penalty with civs you have not met which can make a turn  war to steal workers from the first AI you meet extremely worth.  You also do not get warmonger penalty from cities taken in peace deals.  Declining peace deals doesnt give you warmonger penalty.  If you go to war and dont capture cities you can instead get levels generate great generals thin out the AIs armies so you arent forced to build up your own army steal workers pillage for gold get peace deals in your favor break trade deals kinda gamey you can get the common enemy positive diplomatic modifier which is HUGE lots of things.,civ,d2sfkq7,5,t5_2rk3b

Bismarck has the Panzer which can tear through enemy lines and Washington has the B bomber which again demolishes cities.

7564658,0,t3_4ivrsc,I hate this art style for several reasons.  The game is supposed to reflect real world events as in the civ leaders that it features as well as maps and science progression so a art style where all the units are out of proportion and super CoC looking worries me. I for one have always found the historical aspects of the game entertaining and interesting.  The trees are horrid. They remind me of super low budget cartoon trees not to mention they are very sparse for such a large area of land.  The unit size is tiny unit stacking I know which I think will make the combat feel much less exciting and intense.  I think the new cartooney style will make the game lose a lot of its epicness in battles and overall map look.Its not all horrible though. I have hope for some good feature improvements and overall game smoothness but I absolutely hate this art style and it may ruin the game for me. I bought into this series because it made me feel important and had a sense of epicness. You were the leader of a powerful nation who had free will to rule however you wanted. Fighting off other civs who were actual historical figures etc. made the game so epic. I hope we wont lose any of that with the new art style.

That game looks that way because its old thats it. At the time that was the best they could do so of course loved every second of it.That game looks like shit because its graphics are outdated. I am sure Civ VI will look nice in terms of overall graphics. What people like me dont like is the art style they went with. Its lazy boring it doesnt fit the theme of the game it looks childish etc. If the gameplay is good like really good of course I will play the game but I doubt I will be as immersed as I was in CiV.Yeah its too close to release so no major changes. But they could adjust the saturation rendering some models and textures. To make it look half decent. gt there is no point bemoaning what is especially since there isnt actually anything wrong with it. So we should just shut up and pretend we like it?

England has no parliament and no representation.gtTo say she was not the Queen of England because it is not part of her official title is simply an an abuse of semantics.You can only be QueenKing of Kingdoms the clue is in the name.Obama is not the President of Texas hes the President of the USA. This is basic stuff.gt Its like saying she isnt the Queen in Liverpool because she isnt the Queen OF LiverpoolWell no its like saying she isnt the Queen of Liverpool because she isnt the Queen of Liverpool which she isnt. Liverpool isnt a kingdom. Boris Johnson wasnt Mayor of my house he was Mayor of London.gtHer title is implicitly inclusive of lesser administrative areas while a title like Queen of Liverpool and semantically very important Queen of England are implicitly exclusive of any outside areas. This requires an incredible misunderstanding of what a Kingdom is that I have no idea how to start responding. Duchies have Dukes Earldoms have Earls Marches have Marquis Kingdoms have Kings and Queens.gtSo the monarch of the UK is the monarch of the English in every way sense and form making her use in the game as a very legitimate choice.By the same logic Caesar would be a reasonable choice for leader of England. He was the ruler of the Roman Empire which included England. gtThat all being said we wouldnt use her as the queen of the Scots or the queen of the Cornish so our identification of her as An English Queen ruling over the Uk does come into it...I dont even understand this at all. She is Queen of Cornwall if she is Queen of England by your logic and therefore Queen of Scotland and Queen of your House and Queen of this brick I found lying in the street.

Of course thered always be the option to configure a vanilla game that wouldnt use any of these modifiers.You know what would be really fun .. is if these upgrades applied to the AI as well and not just yourself.  You just unlocked a British Longbowmen perk that allows them to shoot two tiles after getting some combat experience?  Great.  Now the next time you play against Britain expect to face off against them.  The game would thus get more complex with additional upgrades but not necessarily any easier as your opponents would benefit as well.Im thinking along the lines of the Battlefield franchise here which has additional weapons that get unlocked as you progress through the game that keep it fresh.

If it is military consider what units you use versus them maybe you use too much infantry and not enough ranged.gt Should I play a different strategy?Not necessarly though it can be interesting to change a bit. How do you end your game? If you only win through Domination going Wide might be better since more city  more production and wide is generally stronger late game anyway but it might be tricky to go wide on a small mapgt Are we doing too much wonder competition?Probably.

7720692,0,t1_d3jprx3,gt A lot of nonAmericans especially Pacific countries would disagree heavily with Teddys foreign policy.I could probably talk to long about his foreign policy. Teddy was an imperialist or at least wanted America as a great power but even he didnt think the U.S. would obliterate the Spanish navy in less than a day and take control of the Philippines. Everyone knew Spain had declined a ton and America was on the rise but everyone thought America had just passed Spain in military powereveryone but the Spanish that is who knew they were going to get crushed. I think there are a few actions that best sum up TRs foreign policy. The Panama Canal to allow the American Navy to access both oceans.. Extended the Monroe Doctrine to a more activist policy Roosevelt corollary. Under international law it was perfectly acceptable to force countries to pay debts through violent force. But the UK asked Teddy for permission because technically the Monroe Doctrine said that the U.S. wouldnt tolerate European powers trying to reestablish foreign domination of the former Spanish Empire in the Americas. With the huge backlash Teddy switched policies. Europeans could no longer press their claims in the Americas but America would do it for them.. He negotiated the end to the RussoJapanese War. Even though he liked the Japanese better than the Russians in a paternalistic sense the Japanese thought they got shafted. Even thought the Japanese were winning the war he negotiated a deal to return things to basically a prewar position. Id say that was probably a fair deal to end war but probably too fair for the time.. He wanted the U.S. to get involved in WWI to stop what he viewed as German aggression.The big stick policy is actually fitting. He likes American expansionism but he hates foreign powers expanding militarily. ,civ,d3jsg1d,4,t5_2rk3b

Those  tiles follow the automatic process that normally happens because of Culture. So it grabs tiles it thinks are the best. Typically when you found a Shoshone city those bonus tiles make a beeline for nearby resources causing tiles to jut out sometimes as far as  spaces away.In this case the extra tiles are just around the perimeter. I count  extra tiles in the second ring around the city.  of those were likely caused by the unique ability. The city really doesnt have many good opportunities for expansion so the AI grabbed nearby tiles.The Shoshone ability works on every city they found and is easily testable.

IF the number of turns x  is less than the total cost going from your sixth to th policy you wind up getting there faster opening in tradition because apart from increased border growth which is still great and unlocking hanging gardens also great and giving you faster access to aristocracy personal favorite of a admitted wonder ho all it actually gives you is  x number of turns in culture.SO for me I know I pretty much never unlock that  policy shy of turn  so according to the chart linked as long as youre not yet grown past  cities it does indeed unlock the great person faster.I think what often throws people off is that they over complicate the thinking process.  Its not so much about it increasing each successive policy cost which is true its about the total needed culture to reach your goal whether that enough for   or  policies.,civ,d3zjnar,2,t5_2rk3b

Since it makes the rest of the policies more expensive you have to consider that cost as well. Lets assume that the first  policies cost    and then  culture each not exactly sure of the costs based on cities but its around there. So for  policies if you acquire them normally you pay  culture.

You can request help Can you spare this for a friend? trade maps and buy techs from each other. There is also an unconditional surrender mechanic that can happen if you absolutely wreck a civ in war. Basically you can force them to serve your civ telling them what to research what they should focus on and making them join you in war and in return you promise to protect them. You can do this with other nations in trade if they are willing to. Nations that are very far behind tend to ask to become vassal states if your empire is strong.Tile rather than hex map. Inferior.Cities cant defend themselves you NEED units stationed in your cities or anyone can just walk up and capture it. Stacking archers is a good defensive measure.Desert and tundra is horrible.Instead of research happening on its own you can allocate funding towards or away from it. Essentially you can put yourself in a deficit for a few turns to research a tech faster or bring your research to a standstill to make lots of gold.Siege units greatly reduce defensive bonuses of units stationed in cities but suck in combat. Always bring them with you on conquests but protect them with infantry.Instead of evolving policies you pick civics that give you both bonuses and penalties and determine how your civ is run. Police State eliminates unhappiness caused by wars and boosts unit production but has a high maintenance cost and means you cant rush buildings and units with gold because you would need to adopt Universal Suffrage for that ability. Serfdom makes workers build improvements faster but Emancipation gives unhappiness penalties to every other civ in the game unless they adopt it as well. Its a lot of fun to mess around with all your civics and see what works best for you.Multiple selectable leaders for some civs. Every leader has traits that give your empire bonuses Philosophical  Great Person generation and double production speed of universities Protective Walls and Castles are built twice as fast Gunpowder and Archery units start with Drill and City Garrison abilities.Civ  is a lot of fun aside from the very RNG combat.

I personally would likethink it will be Mali like in IV but I could see civs like the Ghana Empire or Benin for West Africa as well. Kongo is another one I see a lot of speculation for.  A Native North American civ. Firaxis could simply just use the Iroquois again or they could implement the Sioux for the first time since II or they could have Inuit think of what they could do with snow and tundra! or Cherokee. I would even go out on a limb and say that it could be the Pueblo but that would be unlikely considering the reason they were cut from Civ V.  A SouthEast Asian Civ. Firaxis has been making it a bit of a point to represent SouthEast Asia in some way we had the Khmer in IV and Siam in V so maybe well get to see someone like Vietnam or Pagan. Indonesia could be returning as well but I doubt it.  A South American Civ either colonial or indidgenous. Firaxis might just fall back on the Inca or Brazil or they could introduce a new Colonial Civ such as Gran Colombia Referred to in the game simply as Colombia and a great excuse to have Simon Bolivar in the game or a new Indigenous civ such as Tarrascans or Chichimecs.

But you dont get observatories until more than halfway through the game after you already have universities anyways and since  bonuses stack additively that means an observatory built in a city that already has a university gives only a  boost to science instead of .If given the choice Id much much rather build a city next to a river or on a coast than next to a mountain. Its a nice bonus if you can get it but its always an afterthought.Besides science isnt important as people on this subreddit believe. Yes advancing in science is what advances the game but  of the new technologies do nothing but unlock new buildings and new units. With higher production costs.  If you dont have an economy advanced enough to build these things in a reasonable time frame unlocking them is pointless. Both science and economy must be developed together.

Im not sure how much further one wants to build upon this.That said I hope for policies that do more than give numerical bonuses and actually give new optionsactions like Civ IVs civics like how having Slavery as your labor system meant you could sacrifice population to rush production or Mercantilism cut off all foreign trade.Id also like something like the vassal system of Civ IV. I understand that Civ Vs puppet cities are an abstraction of creating a clientpuppet state but it isnt very clear on the map e.g. it all just looks like Rome with whatever is left of Siam in the tundra rather than this is Rome and this is Roman Siam and this tiny sliver is SiamInExile.In Civ IV when you liberated some of your cities to create a colonialvassal state it created a new civilization. If we later get multiple leaders per civilization which some people have speculated one could have a system where you liberate Roman Siam creating a new Siamese civilization except its under the alternate leader which makes a little more sense than a whole new civ.

Go for the Education tech quickly and build universities ASAP. Work the  scientist specialist slots in each city as soon as its respective university finishes. This will optimize your generation of great scientists starting in the Medieval era. Your first  or  great scientists should be used for Academy tiles which you must work throughout the game. Place your Academies within  tiles of your capital so you can work them and use the National College to boost their science output further.Starting in Renaissance Era fill out the Rationalism Social Policy tree. At about the Industrial era or so start saving any Great Scientists you get and dont use them for anything. Your next target tech is Plastics so you can get research labs in your top science cities. After building labs in your major science cities wait a few turns and then start popping all your saved scientists for techs. If you beeline straight for the nuke techs while using the scientists voila unhistorically fast nukes.Couple misc things Mountainside cities can build the Observatory which gives  science in that city. These are really really good.In single player on harder difficulties techs will advance much faster because the AI gets a lot of bonuses and you yourself indirectly get a science boost too from trade routes and research agreements with the AI.,civ,d5cxjuu,4,t5_2rk3b

What I would like to see is to allow archaeologists to reveal hidden antiquity sites when the Arch is either on top of or adjacent to a hidden site. Having to complete Exploration as the only route to make hidden sites useful well frankly usable seems overall less appealing as a mechanic. On the flipside to the Arch change when completing Exploration not only would all hidden sites be revealed but your chances of a culture bomb increase from  to . How does that sound?Instead of making archs and sending them off to regular sites you can pay attention to their movements more or use them as a hidden site sweeper on your continent giving them much more micro managed viability.,civ,d5gxqiw,2,t5_2rk3b

We had wars that lasted a handful of turns but no cities ever changed hands.  People only died.  Then China started fucking with Portugal who was on the other side and kinda friendly towards me.  They had a brief uneventful war and declared peace.  I originally tried to get Portugal to declare war on china but he wanted every resource I had.  Asked China to declare war on Portugal and all she wanted was some luxury which I would get back shortly.  China attacks Portugal moves all troops to western border.  I wait a few turns for them to wear down attack the eastern border and get my lux back.  After  or so turns China is down  of  cities including their capital.  Randomly after the war started they attacked Ragusa and captured it.  Every other Chinese city was captured and I vassalled Chine.

Really the same thing if the AI had its priorities straight with the relative value of food production and gold wouldnt need food and tech research bonuses to be as steep.All of my other big issues with the AI are with the diplomacy system like the way warmonger penalties work and how the AI doesnt really get penalties for missionary spam or spying after you tell them not to.

Sometimes it ends up in you choosing a suboptimal pantheon because you didnt e.g. got to discover those  Natural wonders or that big gems resource which would have given you more with the respective Pantheon than e.g. WineIncense with theirs. That said if you spawn in a desert you CAN open stele cause you will want desert folklore anyway and the earlier you get the stele the earlier you get your religion.I open scout  of the time on Ethiopia tho and Im quite experienced with them mostly singleplayer but starting BO is the same as in MP.

8469340,0,t1_d6030os,What I said is a great way to get better at the game and macro.Sure my favorite strategy which can win domination before turn  on PrinceIts basically the Cbow rush. Heres an OP Babylon strategy. First learn to lock tiles and set to production. . Pottery gt Writing gt Animal Husb gt Archery gt Mining and take LIBERTY.. Plop free scientist on wheat cattle for  sum tile.. Scout explore and steal worker from neighbor civ with warrior. Monument. Scout switch these  if heavy foresthills to steal worker from CS. Shrine if relevant start for pantheon. Granary. Archer Archer. Build Settler. Archer Archer Archer. Caravan if other neighbor. Pop free settler. Try to settle two cities in good spots by turn  to turn .. Try to get Construction by turn  and hoard gold to upgrade  CBows. Before you take a capital you need to get National College first. You also can get Oracle and pop the great engineer on NC. Very powerful.. Storm weakest neighbor with  CB lt city HP spearwarrior and horse to get capital.. Peace out beeline Civil Service for food. Here you either take Education or go for XB rush. If you farmed city states earlier with your archers and CB you should have big upgrade archers and  Great Generals. On lower levels than deity your military will be so much stronger than the AIs it will be insanely easy to take another city with XB and maybe add a catapult to get shotted as a distraction.. After this judgment call Cannons and Knights with your XB are extremely OP if you have a lot of units before the AI to pillage and cause all sorts of problems killing trade units.. From here on the strategy is less linear. You should have  capitals by this point. But the other civs may be weaker if you have all the wonders by conquest. You are the snowball and you should be able to take the rest out eventually but if the map is difficult you can pivot to science culture or diplo it depends on your situation. Try this strat. Its much more fun than turtling like  of civ players. Youll also dominate in multiplayer.Other civs good for this are Poland and London Shaka and Germany.,civ,d607ghd,1,t5_2rk3b

8556396,0,t1_d6az9wm,IIRC the developer said that they wanted Eurekas to be a method of diversifying one game from another and changing what path youll go down rather than the always going down the tradition route in Civ .While I get what youre going for the build  archers and kill an enemy ranged unit not owned by barbarians both achieve the same goal youre going to war with someone. I think diversity would arise from having it be more like have a ranged unit take x promotion.  For example if its strength on attack in hills and you are surrounded by hills its a sure bet youre going to do it. However if you arent then you have to choose which is more important  turns on this tech or xp on this ranged unit?However the main place Id like to see the improvements would be in nonmilitary tech. It stands to follow that if you make more archers youll eventually know how to perfect that and make better archers. But with nonmilitary tech just making a campus isnt going to help you unlock any technological secrets. It should promote specialisation and diversification  have two adjacent campus districts for example. This means that you have to a do it twice and b devote yourself to doing something that will set you down a different path. In every city youre probably going to build a campus at some point but two? Thats specialisation. When you have several Eurekas like that in near enough the same era or stage in the era then you force players to choose which path they want to go down based on their current scenario. E.G. Surrounded by rainforest? Double campus surrounded by mountains? Holy site it is then!Rotate these around every now and then  in this game you dont need to build two campuses but you do need to pay patronage to a Great scientist or something then there cant be one set path because the path wont always be the same.,civ,d6b4i45,1,t5_2rk3b

Also I imagine the best places to settle will be gone by that time anyway. If I would want to expand that late I would make sure it would be at the expense of my rivals and would use that gold for quickly raising an army and conquest.

8716023,0,t1_d6v37g7,V is a wellestablished polished game with a huge community of active players mods guides and lets plays. You can start playing now and the games pretty much always on sale at a huge markdown. This is the current cheapest price Ive found for Civ V Complete which is what youd want to get if you choose too start with V. If you miss that deal this site ebay and other ebaylike sites are the place to look for more.Civ VI on the other hand has a lot of hype around it and may feel like the core game ideas are cooler or more mature since its newer. Civ games without expansions before they come out have been notoriously disappointing in the past to players who are used to playing Complete versions of the game the first few months are likely to be pretty buggy and untuned you have to wait until late October to start playing and buying each expansion and DLC for the game as it comes out rather than as a package after several are released will likely cost you ish. At the end of the day play the free trial of Civ V one or two times then watch some videos of gameplay in V and VI and decide which game appeals to you more. Cheers!,civ,d6v53ov,14,t5_2rk3b

Also americans make about x as much as the chinese do with Chinese peope making on average  a year. A big reason why america is considered great is because in less than  years we went from a small colony to the rd most populous country and the strongest nation on earth.

8886667,1,t1_d7fxaij,Echo Chamber doesnt necessarily have to do with reward though it have a role its any environment where information beliefs or ideas are reinforced while different views are censored or underrepresented. Reddits Karma system surely play into that but every social media if not the internet as a whole have some kind of mechanic that create echo chambers. Facebook is a good example. It automatically try to adjust your timeline to show and suggest things you like so the more you engage with one idea the more facebook direct you to things that are about that idea. Mix this with tools to get rid of what you disagree while getting more exposition to what you agree i.e block pages you dont agree while you like pages you agree and the more you use facebook the more it become a closed environment where your world view looks like the ultimate truth. It also play into the same reward system that Reddits Karma does with things that are liked and shared getting more exposition than things that are ignored.  Any other social media have this kind of mechanic to some extension though I do agree that some social medias are more susceptible to others with Reddit being a big offender. I think a forum like Civfanatics would be the place where you get less of this effect since commentaries are arranged in the order its posted and FAIK you dont have any kind of tool to personalize what you see nor background mechanics manipulating what youre exposed to.  Though internet amplify this effect we get ourselves into Echo Chambers in real life too. You will favor friendships that have the same taste and opinions as you do over people that you disagree or have a different taste. Youll give more attention and talk more to people that make you feel good than people that will disagree and challenge your world view. On top of that reward also play a role in real life. I might pretend that I agree with you or just remain silent because I dont want to get into a discussion with you or I dont want you to think bad of me. I might pretend I value something I dont or pretend I care about something I dont just to be accepted in a group reinforcing that group ideas. In this sense the internet is actually good since people speak their mind when they are anonymous even more than they should. Aside from social interaction we also favor media that reinforce our idea creating our own personal echo chamber. ,civ,d7g1vhg,-1,t5_2rk3b

NorwayDetails on why are below.Greece  The flexibility and earlygame advantage of the extra wildcard policy cannot be understated. Classical era governments only have  cards and theyre already set by type. One extra policy of any type so early on is a massive bonus due to its snowball potential.China  Bonuses to Eureka! moments and Inspirations is basically a direct bonus to science one of the two most important yields in Civ. The builder ability to rush early wonders combined with the science discovery boosts increases your potential to snowball out of control really early on and pick any victory you want.Brazil  Feels a lot like an anyvictory Babylon. Bonuses to great people generation and the ability to get massive tile yields early in the game.Egypt  The Wonder Whore returns. With a good river start youll be able to snag so many wonders early on that you can run away with the gameAztecs  Luxuries and their UB give more amenities which lets them grow more  and we know how growth is king. The extra workers you get and their district building bonus help you get your cities up and running sooner which lets the Aztecs carry their accelerated growth advantage throughout the game.Scythia  This civ seems like the kind of civ thats godlike in a players hands but bottomtier under AI control. Amazing for early war with their combat bonus and their  cavalry unit bonus. Knowing AI diplomacy this is the kind of AI civ that will eliminate an enemy early and get dogpiled afterwards.Kongo  It really depends on how much sooner the MBanza is unlocked compared to regular neighborhoods. Ex if you can make MBanzas starting in classical era but neighborhoods starting in renaissance then its a huge growth advantage. The extra foodprodgold is cool but its more of a winmore trait  first you need to actually secure those great artists and artifacts.Japan  Not liking how their combat bonus is restricted to coastal conditions. It is pretty strong though   bonus for land units on coast and  bonus for water units in shallow water. The district bonus looks like its  of relevant yield per nearby district which actually isnt too bad. It means that your yields will slowly increase as the game goes on and your cities expand.Germany  Not entirely certain how strong the extra district at a given population is. The nice thing about Germany though is that at least some part of their unique bonuses will always be available. The extra Military policy is very strong in the earlygame  not quite as good as Greeces wildcard but still a big early bonus. From the sound of it once the Hanse gets built in the midgame Germany will become a production monster.India  Really depends on how good the UI is.France  Very midgamecentric. Little flexibility in utilizing their bonuses  you need to go for the midgame wonders and boost your tourism output. But by the time the midgame arrives a different civ might have already snowballed an early advantage. If they take all the wonders youre trying to get your unique bonuses are practically nonexistent.England  This and Norway are the civs you should be fearing if you have lots of coastal cities. The dockyard is probably one of the best district replacements Ive seen thus far with their bonus to ship movement. If the map has any water at all on it England will dominate it come the midgame. Some nice tourism bonuses make them a bit less onedimensional.America  Really hard to judge without hard numbers on the Founding Fathers ability. But since you have to switch governments pretty regularly in the earlygame this bonus probably wont do too much until later. One problem is that if you arent the culturally dominant civ in the game you might be forced to switch governments more often and lose your UA bonus. The homecontinent bonus is useful for securing it for yourself though.Norway  Only good on maps with plenty of water. All of his bonuses except the Stave Church are waroriented. Most of the highertier civs have bonuses that are useful on any map and for almost any victory so I consider Norway to be a bit lacking. EDIT Reorganized some corrections. Added Germany details expanded on Japan details.,civ,d7q3k2i,9,t5_2rk3b

Still it should be enough to estimate if you card is strong enough.Here are the D scoresGeForce GTS  | GeForce GTX  | GeForce M|||  | So... it doesnt look that great for you. And its easy to see why.

On standart map and settings common luxuries have  copies so controlling  of them is enough numbers can vary sometimes copper had  copies in last game for exampleStrategic resources have  tiers of monopoly one in  other in .  monopoly improves combat characteristics. Horses give  attack iron gives  defence coal gives  movement for naval etc.Monopoly bonuses are really worthy to have. I do not remember bonus for all resources but they are like  happinesswine  golden age lengthmarble  culture  golddyes  productioncopper  food on resourceolivecrab and several other bonuses.Corporations become available on corporations tech. There are  corporations and a corporation requires a monopoly on one of the many resources. For example Civilized Jewellers can be founded by a monopoly on gold silver lapus lazuli gems or jade. On monopoly screen every resources and biggest owners are listed so you can know your competitors to a certain corporation and plan ahead to ensure you get your target corporation. A corporation is a wonder and can be built by one civ. Also each civ can have only one corporation.Once conditions are met you get to build corporate HQ wonder which gives a free corporate office to the city and allows further corporate offices to be built in other cities. Initially corporate offices yield minor bonuses but their main power is scaled by number corporate franchises. For example Giorgio Armaier corporation offices gives  culture per franchise. Franchises are built when your caravancargo ship from a city with corporate office finishes a trade route to another civ of city state. When you have  franchises established it is now  culture per office. When you build  offices in your cities it is a whopping  culture per turn. Offices also have trade route bonuses to cities with your corporate franchises like  culture per trade route in Giorgio Armaier. ,civ,d83ucaf,3,t5_2rk3b

In V if you were winning everyone hated you or you were losing and then everyone bullied you. Agendas looks like it will make interaction more interesting and more developed storylines will be generated.My guess is that they will be buffed much like before with more units amp modifiers on Culture Science Gold amp Faith while more advanced techniques will allow better players to gain a greater edge than before.

Civ  tourism victory doesnt really seem to do that. Im sort of on the fence over whether I want to see the world congress or anything like that come back. What I didnt like about it was that there was no defense against it. You could control half the world but if the guy with the city states said you werent going to benefit from crabs or that you couldnt build nukes you were bound by it.

9313950,0,t1_d8sv7an,Workers and Pathfinders are equally important but I think I recommend Pathfinders more. Youre not going to lose the early game by building a mine a few turns late but you can lose a huge advantage by letting an opponent take an Ancient Ruins. Especially when that bonus can be a Composite Bowman worth tons of hammers and research especially on Epic speed or an extra citizen working two unimproved tiles in a city is about the same as having one improved tile. You mentioned that you usually take gold from Ancient Ruins do you really need it? Unless you plan on buying a unit I cant see how it would be very useful. Personally I think culture makes a bigger difference by either giving you a free early Monument with Tradition or Worker Liberty.I would actually suggest going for Liberty instead of Tradition. Youre going to control a huge amount of land and the  worker speed is great for getting your economy going. As for the other Liberty policies extra  production per city doesnt sound like much but it works about to be about the same as Traditions wonder bonus and free monument. The free settler is fantastic settlers are a weapon in Shoshone hands. Take allll the land. Military and buildings can be a problem yes  the solution is to build your economy. Once youre sure there are no more Ancient Ruins on the map send your PathfindersComposite Bowman home to defend the borders. Build Workers like crazy and develop your land. Its always better to build a Worker than an early building like a Granary or Monument. Workers are an investment that can improve multiple tiles over their lifetime. Once your cities have productions from mines and a good source of food they can build those Granaries faster. Military units can also be built at this point. Until your economy is good enough to build military units try not to piss anybody off. Its gonna be hard when youre grabbing all the land in sight. As a general rule I garrison two units per city on Emperor or Immortal difficulty. If youre playing with Raging Barbarians Honor is great but personally I wouldnt try to unlock the whole tree. You get more bang for your buck by completing Tradition growth in all cities or Liberty great person of your choice usually Great Engineer to grab Great Wall.,civ,d8wm1kp,1,t5_2rk3b

As scythia though I dont think this is the case even with another policy activated since youre making double your production worth of gold. gt I avoided teching to make them obsolete also I dont believe you even have to do this scythia can produce cavalry and all subsequent light cavalry upgrades I think helicopters even  for  as well so its just as effective.

By the end of the game all of my cities were popping out Info Era military units at a pace of  every  turns. I had  cities. Thats a LOT of freakin military units.Start of game build order to get the machine running is pretty simpleScout  Slinger  Slinger  Slinger  Settler buy a Builder as soon as you canFrom there your new cities go Builder gt Archer gt Hansa until youve got sufficient military and workers to cover what will be a MASSIVE empire then they go straight to Hansa. Try to build districts in diamonds between cities so the AOE covers as many of them as possible.Cap literally stays on Archer gt Settler over and over until you have filled every square inch of your starting zone. Cities are built absolute BARE MINIMUM distance apart as soon as the red switches to greenwhite thats where you build. Dont worry about the quality of the location. They will grow huge and put out INSANE production regardless. ,civ,d9d1gc9,2,t5_2rk3b

If you can keep your coastal tiles to a minimum while still maximizing land youd get the harbor bonus plus still have a powerhouse land focused city.A layout like London for example would be ideal in the civ  world access to ocean just on the outer edge of the cities influence.  Cities with large amounts of coast or around bays like the nightmare that is Venice New Orleans Carthage and most of the ones you mentioned would in Civ  have  of the cities workable tiles be worthless oceanbay.  The whole point of this post and discussion is to say that there is NO incentive to build a city with more than one nonresource coastal tile for harbor and little incentive to get fish or crabs when you incorporate  more useless ocean tiles to get them.,civ,d9e1tmn,10,t5_2rk3b

Copypasted from Civfanatics Even the very first line you are greeted with every time you load a game is perplexingly stupid From the first stirrings of life beneath water... to the great beasts of the Stone Age... to man taking his first upright steps you have come far.This sentence alone has several huge problems. First off are they seriously implying that mankind walked on four legs in the stone age or that this was the age of dinosaurs? This fails at grade school level history. Civilization games START in the stone age. How could a mistake like this even happen? Second who the hell has come far? Mankind? But the previous subsentence referred to mankind in third person! This sentence closer doesnt work at all and feels like it was tacked on because the writer didnt know how to end his trail of words.

9571911,0,t3_5buwm2,going by the whole Beyond Earth experience my impression is that firaxis or K doesnt really care much about support for their games. i would assume most of the team at launch just gets moved to a new game project or to an expansion project and what is left over to fix the problems present in the game at release is a very small staff or it is relegated to a mere side project for staffers. it is frustrating when you are accustomed to other companies handling the situation very differently and prioritizing a satisfying experience for their paying customers since it is so important to do so to maintain your reputation and the reputation for the civilization franchise i think is very valuable. but the final incarnation of beyond earth is so desperately in need of further support in my eyes and the patches themselves so few and far between and so uncomprehensive that i cannot conceive that this company prioritizes using up a lot of staff hours on things they cannot actually package and sell such as balance patches. i think what exacerbates this feeling for me is how noncommunicative this company is with their community compared to other companies. it seems to convey to me a kind of guilt about the situation of needed support for the game. what also exacerbates this feeling for me is how consistently this company seems to come out on release day with a product that feels untested buggy and somewhat rushed out. i believe they have made a reputation of this by now across many launches. this speaks to me of a company that prioritizes payroll efficiency over getting the experience just right. ,civ,d9sxlv6,1,t5_2rk3b

Probably not a great idea but as I said I can still win at this difficulty with that.  My formula is.  Build a warrior and some archers.  Build settler use archers to shoot barbarians at this point who will probably be attacking while you are building settler.  Dont settle too far from base.  You will need to defend this empire. .  Build another settler some archers same thing dont settle too far. .  Again same thing you should now have  towns.  Cool..  Town specialties.  First town capital gets an encampment and library and workshop.  Others get workshops and commercial zones.  I like workshops to churn units.  I like commercial zones to pay the units.  I dont care about religion or culture at all but you can build one religious building as defense it helps sometimes.  The library in first town should be enough...to get to gunpowder Ill cover in a sec..  If you have any extra turns in your towns built yourself some ancient walls.  Its important because a defense and b due to how dumb war weariness is implemented you will probably get constant rebellions also my strategy does not build amenities.  I find that if I can build an ancient wall no AI on this difficulty level can ever take my city.  I think they just arent smart enough to bring enough siege units.  They might bring one but I can take that out..  Got walls?  Now build  catapults.  That will be enough to win the game with but ONLY after you upgrade them to cannons.  Though unupgraded you can still try to conquer someone with these and swordsmen.  Not  necessary.  You could instead take a few towns..  Now you should be almost at gunpowder.  Also you can go for mercantilism.  Gives you a discount on upgrades.  Once you get gunpowder look around for that saltpeter.  Set a settler there and take that thing.  When settler is moving research metal casting gives you a cannon its right after gunpowder.  By the time you settle you will almost definitely have metal casting..  Upgrade everything with the mercantilism trait and uh go conquer everything.  I like the cannons the musket men and maybe some knights.  Optionally some crossbowmen or upgraded to field cannons also complements pretty nicely but leave some xbow men at home for the inevitable rebellions as you squash every unit everywhere..  When you are attacking everything probably people will rebel because of war weariness.  Well too bad.  You have ancient walls and probably field cannons everywhere.,civ,d9u2qc5,1,t5_2rk3b

I do have a top  though in no particular order I love all of them equallyAmerica  dont need to explain this one the majority here loves the American theme. I love how it evolves the best out of everyone else the first two themes sound Celtic which I love in style and reminds me of a peaceful little town. As it gets industrial it becomes a full blown orchestra and starts to feel a lot more heroic and grand. The final one is like a hybrid between popelectronic music and orchestra and the result is fantastic.China  one word beautiful. The Guqin is almost enchanting to hear its peaceful amp great for meditating in ancient to medieval era but becomes very grand and intense late game. I think this theme is the most iconic to the culture of the civ  most people will know its the Chinese theme straight away. I already love playing China and their music makes the experience ten times better.England  Im a big fan of Scarborough Fair and Im delighted to hear it in the game. Especially in the later eras in orchestral form it becomes very intense like others and emotional. Just awesome.Other notable themes Sumeria Japan industrial and above Kongo medieval Russia Kalinka cyka! and Greece.To Christopher Tin Geoff Knorr and the musical team give yourselves a pat in the back youve done an amazing job.,civ,d9yaek0,2,t5_2rk3b

Friendly civs with very high friendship score still declare war against you despite being outnumbered and outteched and without you being anywhere near victory conditions. There is a promise system that does absolutely nothing. An AI can blame you for being near their border while they are massing against YOUR border and you cant even do the same. You cant protect a valuable city state if an AI tries to take them over unless you take an absurd warmongering penalty for defending a city state youre a suzerain of ...This means that practically diplomacy is butchered to the point of absurdity and nonexistence.The cynical me could appreciate that diplomacy is really a sham and means nothing in front of military force but the gamer in me is sad that game mechanics could be so unpolished.,civ,da1xw98,3,t5_2rk3b

The turtle is kinda your classic tall getting a good defensive position then investing in accruing culture and science to forge a path forward it beats the snake because it can withstand getting attacked thanks to defensive tech.The snake is about being aggressive and attacking other civs to grow building military units with its resources it beats the hare because it can take  their poorly defended land.Figure out how to adapt your previous strategy to this new meta.,civ,db0oejk,1,t5_2rk3b

In the AtomicInformation Era you will also be able to build National Parks and Seaside Resorts which will also yield tourism. Also there are several late era civics and wonders that helps you get more tourists. IIRC open borders trade routes and religion not sure about this one affects tourism as well. Some great people give you additional trade route tourism bonus as well.In general if you want to win Cultural victory you want a lot of wonders great works National parks and Seaside resorts related great people and as many international trade routes as possible. One trade route to one country is enough though.Even if you are not aiming for cultural victory you want a solid culture yield in your empire. Along with that build wonders beneficial and get great peoples not so beneficial to hinder other civs from stacking tourism. In late era you can steal great works to further delay other civs cultural victory progress.Tourism doesnt benefit your empire in any way except the victory. Which is a downgrade actually in Civ V Tourism affected other aspects of the gameplay as well.Culture does benefit you with civics and not being defeated by other civs but I think thats it.,civ,db3r7k1,2,t5_2rk3b

In  you get a production and gold penalty corruption in each city based on its distance from your capital.  Some buildings reduce this but at a certain distance from your capital you still lose  of what you produce no matter what.  This means that in  if you play on a large map and take a lot of territory you end up with a core of maybe  useful cities with the remainder being stuck at  gold and  production since no matter how far from your capital they are they always have  as a minimum.  As someone who favors large epic maps instead of small ones this made me prefer  by a huge amount.  Your preferences may vary.,civ,dbv5er4,3,t5_2rk3b

I also like adjacency bonus because you can use it to help out cities start with bonus from a nearby city though Im not sure if I like the current settings with district costs becoming increasingly expensive over time.That said until the AI can offer the same challenge that they do early game during every era I will temper my excitement about the game.

10203836,0,t3_5m3ueh,Another issue is that the reports screen dont show when a deal will end nor you get a notification like you did in Civ V so the only way to keep track of your importedexported luxuries is if you keep note yourself ingame theres no way to do it aside from hovering your gold income if there was gold involved in the trade and you still need to memorize what you traded for that gold because it dont tell. Anyway its more of an UI issue than a issue with the luxury system. The reports screen was clearly an afterthought added only later in the game the medias demo didnt have it so hopefully they are doing an overhaul of the whole thing because it still lacking a lot even though they already did a few improvements.  The issue with having no access to relevant information when the AI talk to you on their turn is an old Civ V issue that sadly they didnt improve in Civ VI which I hoped they would. For me its specially annoying when a Leader ask to be my friend and I cant see his relationship with other leaders which is relevant since I get a penalty with everyone that denounced him or was denounced by him if I accept the friendship. ,civ,dc0nu95,36,t5_2rk3b

10206125,0,t1_dc0roc4,Okay so this is how production works. Every building or unit has a certain production cost and the city youre building it in has a production output. Lets say you want to build a swordsman This has a production cost of . Lets say your city has a production output of  that is all of your mines and districts that produce cogs adds up to . This means that every turn that  is going to eat into the units production cost. So in this case the unit will take  turns to build a production cost of  with  being used each turn. You can see what a citys production is by clicking on it and looking at the cog icon in the bottom right hover over it for a breakdown. Sorry if this is explained badly  just ask me if theres anything you want clarification on. The short answer to your question though is yes you should always be upgrading your tiles. Hills can be upgraded to mines production and plains can be upgraded to farms food and so on. Dont just upgrade tiles that have resources like horses on them upgrade as much as you can. Also to help you get a better idea of how this works turn on the tile yields icon one of the buttons above the map.

10220696,0,t1_dc2i4hk,I suppose the counter is to weather Scythias first overwhelming power spike letting them fade into obscurity afterward. This is of course very much easier said than done and I think it requires cooperation. Players need to realize that if they dont band together against Scythia early they will snowball and most likely win. If players can agree to close ranks as early into the game as possible until theyre on the other side of Scythias power spike maybe that would stop them from being so dominant.But this isnt an argument that theyre balanced  they do seem disproportionately powerful. Its an interesting dilemma whether a civilization can be balanced around early game military power spikes. On the one hand it does mean that Scythia is something of a makeorbreak civ with few avenues for victory if they dont conquer a whole lot early which is an interesting design choice. On the other hand its extremely difficult for other civs to deal with as early game power spikes are the hardest to counter  there hasnt been enough time to prepare. But for now I think the most ideal tactic for countering them early is for human players to realize the need to band together.,civ,dc2kn94,8,t5_2rk3b

10310935,0,t1_dcbz3o8,gt Well its simply not true that you get attacked for no reason. You get attacked for being weak in terms of units not necessarily strength negative relationships having an AI paid by other AI to war against you or being close to a victory condition they are going for.In my last two games before I gave the thing up none of those factors you cite applied when the DOWs were coming in. They came in predominantly from friendly vastly underpowered and outnumbered civs with agendas that were satisfied that didnt have a lot of money to throw around I know since thats how I got friendly with them at all and I play with all victory conditions turned off as a default. If an AI is somehow able behind the strings to pull together enough loose change to fund a dogpile coalition in those circumstances then frankly that too speaks to shoddy AI design  because an AI asked to Dogpile in those circumstances in Civ  or even  prior to GampK wouldnt even entertain the idea regardless of whether it was another AI that spruiked it or not.gt Ive played games where Ive destroyed civs before either of us has met a third and theres no warmonger penalty.Again last game this happened. Met China after taking a Kongo city out of sheer frustration.. sure enough good old Shi Huang was pretty pissy about my doing so.As to your comments on Agenda Im sorry but you havent addressed how the system can be considered working well when you will violate agendas for a good number of civs simply by playing the game.Youll piss off Victoria Shi Huang Pericles and Pedro simply by virtue of playing for various reasons. If you dont already have a coastal city by the time you meet Harald thus no navy you can add him to the list of pissy for no reason. You can wipe every Barb camp you come across but the second you defog an area of the map with an encampment trapped between another AI civ and the coast that youve never been able to get to add anyone with the hates barbs why arent you killing them agenda to that list too.gt And its critical to start building positive relationships early because then you can use that pool to warmonger and still maintain relationships. Trade delegations and embassies have to be done immediately and declaring friendships and alliances will help in the mid to late gameWhilst certainly true this is no revelation. Ensuring a surplus of a particular positive before undertaking an action thatll decay against that positive is something we as a community have dealt with since well before Civ  introduced citybased health and happiness counters. And it does little to alleviate shit design.gt But ultimately destroying another Civ should damage your relationships pretty severelyTrue but thats not what Ive argued so this is a strawman. What Ive argued is simply that it should be possible to a maintain positive relations with other AI players and b possible to degrade a military opponents capacity to wage war on you on an ongoing if intermittent basis without having to resort to action that compromises the entire diplomatic game. You still havent addressed how that is possible or how the design flaws Ive gone into detail about are indeed simply cognitive dissonance on the communitys part.gt Its definitely a better system than diplomacy in V and I think the first major expansion is going to build on it.The current experience is definitely worse than Civ . The ideas the system is based around and the structure of the system is superior in that we agree. But the norms that the system utilises are currently irretrievably unbalanced and the experience resulting is shitful. And other than repeating your implication that the entire community are just whingeing and are collectively lazydumb etc for not accepting something that you choose to you havent addressed at all why the diplomacy design isnt fundamentally flawed. The criticism to be clear is not that this situation exists any of us with any experience as gamers know by now that we do UAT on the projects behalf and have done so for some years more that there seems to be very little communication on what the plan is to do anything about it.... oh and then we get one or two cases of someone chiming in claiming that everythings fine and that the nearuniversal conclusions of the community to the game are actually misinformed and misguided,civ,dccstwp,1,t5_2rk3b

Otherwise if the map allows I sometimes try to settle my first cities pretty fast. This way my cities take up area barbarians can spawn on in the future.  Be careful with war. A lost war is lost time. You might fall back big time. Science wins wars. Stash some gold just in case you need some extra units. Dont start with the tricky leaders. Start with something that you can understand without having to much time in the game. I like Russia and Poland for example.  When you reach the industrial era you can go for Ideology through this you can fix happiness problems. The AI kinda got a clock for their first settlers really weird. They will spawn settlers even tough there is no good spot. Keep your settlers safe have a unit with them or be sure that there are no enemies near.

10393958,0,t1_dcm3ye2,On the subject of an AI that actually tries to win and tries to fight you instead of messing around they tried that in early Civ V days. The response was overwhelmingly negative. And its a bad idea because it would inevitably turn into everyone hating the player by the end of the game which isnt actually very fun. I think archaeologists is a fun idea in concept certainly archaeologists had a great impact on our idea of civilization and history but ultimately a tedious minigame that makes players feel like theyre accomplishing something when they really arent. Id prefer it was dumped in favor of keeping the simple focus on empirebuilding.Its simple to say add more catchup abilities but that starts to get very close to undermining early game strategy. Whats the benefit of having a powerful early game if its going to be negated by the fact that someone else gets a freebie? Why bother planning and executing a strategy for my first hundred turns if the game is going to give me a free ride later on anyway? You cant just hand out catchup mechanics in a strategy game. It destroys the core principles of strategy. That needs to be done with great care and cannot be very potent.While I have my own ideas for the directions Civ could take to improve this I also have issues with these ideas that prevent me from really suggesting them. Ultimately I think the current state of the midtoendgame in Civ is just going to have to be an acceptable tradeoff. With that said a major thing that can be done to make the computer players more dynamic and interesting would be to program them to better understand and utilize the game systems so it could get more out of its massive numerical advantages at higher difficulty levels. How feasible is that? I dont know but Im rather confident that there will be significant improvements to the AI in the futuredone by modders when the full set of modding tools is released. ,civ,dcm7zj6,4,t5_2rk3b

10495215,0,t1_dcxhpus,Civ  has Cultural and Diplomatic Victories in addition to the space race victory that every single Civ game since the first has had. It actually has more victory types than V because it treats Conquest and Domination victories as different things. Conquest is eliminating every rival Domination is controlling a certain  of the worlds land and population.As for playing peacefully in IV I say its very reasonable to do this. There are some caveats however. You will need a decentsized military to discourage rivals from attacking and its more than you might think you need. And you will do a lot better if you eliminate one or two rivals early to give yourself some expansion room. Competition for land is extremely important to Civ IVs gameplay one of the reasons I like it for all the talk of playing the land and the land is the star in recent iterations its never felt more important to me than it was in IV and having an advantage there helps immensely. With that said for the OP V is easier to pick up and play. While I prefer the depth of IV and I think the hatred of doomstacks is misguided and often illinformed it is far easier to jump in and understand V. Itll also feel like theres more going on because of all the random little quests and freebies and crap. I think whether or not much of that has any game impact or even has a place in a strategy game is up for debate but it has a certain appeal to it. The lack of emphasis on land being important also helps make passivepeaceful play feel more immediately rewarding.,civ,dcxqr7p,5,t5_2rk3b

I ran into this myself and ultimately I determined that you cannot ask them to stop converting your cities unless they have successfully converted a city to their religion with a majority. Simply spreading religion and reducing yourself isnt enough.The whole religion setup is pretty poorly implimented in . In  religions were less customizable without mods but you could have multiple religions and all that mattered was your state religion. So if you had Judiasm as your state religion youd get benefits for having that religion in a city... but if any other religion was in the city youd get the ability to build those other religions buildings just not benefit from the state religion aspect. Not having UPT meant missionaries werent in your way and in  they needed open borders to enter your territory. Since their was an advantage to having religions of other people that wasnt a bad thing.Worst thing ok second worst behind diplomacy or third behind UPT in  is that there is a severe penalty for allowing other religions and effectively no real advantage.,civ,dd03p2o,7,t5_2rk3b

Its not that hard to do and he wouldnt lose his mac operating system. The game would also play better for him.The alliance system actually works really well. We play with pretty random settings and we just set up so that the first person you meet is your team mate if neither of you are on a team yet.

But for most civs I find that  composite bowmen and a Pikeman or two are enough to defend until they have Riflemen. Having the tradition tenet with more city ranged attack is also very useful on higher levels.As others have pointed out the AI is pretty bad at combat. My favourite example is when they have reduced your city to  defense but cant move a melee unit to take it. Lakes are especially bad for the AI as well as he will often move squishy units like Trebuchets onto water allowing your cities to oneshot them.Whats also a lot of help is allying a CS near them which will cause them to go to war along side you which will often keep the AI busy enough until you can build up a bit more. If youve been at war a while and are lucky to have a Great General the Fort building is incredible as the AI will often kill their units when they move beside it.,civ,de0h94u,2,t5_2rk3b

The problem is that the mouse edge scrolling is based on the graphical view of the game not the screen so at the top of the screen if your mouse pointer is past the edge of the graphical view window it wont scroll up. This is the part that can be fixed with a text editor on some file. The other problem though is that scrolling left and right wont work if there are interface elements at the side of the screen under your mouse.  If I was in charge of changing that line in the list I would have under UI   Mouse edge scrolling broken only works on edge of view window not screen.

11275275,0,t3_5ka8rp,I will testify to the usefulness of changing processing priority in Civ . On large maps with many AI players turns can take a long time. Normally Civ  seems to be set to Below Normal priority in the Windows task manager. After setting the priority to High or Above Normal I find that turns process much much quicker. Its the difference between playable and unplayable on certain map sizes. So yes changing CPU priority WILL help your performance.However for some reason recently Windows  has been changing Civs CPU priority after I set it as described by the OP as well. Im not sure how to stop it from doing that but I aim to find out. There are some tools that supposedly do the trick but Im looking for something that allows me to continue using Windows Task Manager and not a whole new manager utility like Process Hacker.,civ,dfa1b4b,1,t5_2rk3b

That said all Italians think they have a distinct cultural identity from the rest of Italy. Sicily is just the most extreme with its own language similar to how Scots is its own language. But even Naples wouldnt have necessarily been considered Italian in the same way as Milan in . Preunification Italy is my goto example of prePhilip Greece.

It already gives your adjacent tiles appeal by the way.Whereas the IZ gives you GPPs for engineers Hammers AoE hammers  District adjacency bonus for self and others Specialist slots  appeal for adjacent tilesThe Ent. Complex just gives  amenity for parent city another  for arena up to  AoE amenities district adjacency bonus for others  appeal for adjacent tilesWith no yields or GP why bother in every city when the focal point of the building is the AoE effect? These complexes should still be used and placed with the upmost care. If you cannot provide at least  cities including the parent with amenities then youre doing something wrong. I dont think it needs any work as it is stronger than it seems. For starters it allows Colosseum your earlybird zoo amp stadium combined that stacks later with both buildings. If you keep up with the buildings any new cities you lay in range will have the bonus to growth and yields. Depending on if you grabbed Colosseum or not the buildings amp Joseph Paxton you will find you can keep the ecstatic bonus  growth amp  non food yields for a short time of the new citys development or a very long time.For instance City A has the Colosseum zoo amp stadium amp Mr. Paxton. Total AoE amenities are  amenities within  tile radius  for those within . City B just was founded within the  tile range. Without connecting any luxury resources or anything else that could provide amenities City B will have the ecstatic bonus until it reaches  population to which it scales to just being happy. The big perk to this you can focus developing new cities and only really have to worry about housing limiting your growth.Heres what I wrote on Paxton industrial era engineer just added this spring in another threadgt Joseph Paxton is just as if not more important than Tesla. Teslas giving you  hammers per city and  range on factoryplant. Paxton is actually giving  amenities  each for zoo amp stadium with the three range thats HUGE. If you have  cities within range including home city youre looking at  amenities total on top of the  per city you get from zoostadium. What big about this is the remaining amenities not associated to the district will be shifted to other cities out of range. May not seem that big but now multiply this affect by  with Mausoleums effect the bonuses essentially replace  luxury resources.If you can get Paxton in the industrial era lil harder than it seems as you have to get him on the GP menu before advancing eras which happens quickly then youll be pretty much set on amenities for the rest of the game. Also building new cities within range will have a  to amenities from the get go allowing for the Ecstatic  growth amp  to non food yields to remain steady for the first  citizens.TLDR The entertainment complex is more than just for keeping your current cities happy but also promoting quicker development of new cities within range.Edit I made some good finds concerning Mausoleum amp Engineers I would consider it very prevalent.,civ,dg38sic,1,t5_2rk3b

How to implement I have no idea but some sort of delay or even total lack of communications with far flung units and cities would be a cool feature.  Could even extend well into the modern era with subs and other units fighting overseas until you get some sort of advanced communications or something.  Couple that with some level of autonomy for the units and it would be real cool...i.e. Create a patrol mission for a sub set the area to patrol for how long before they check in and go.  Give some guidelines line defend only attack barbs and hostiles only etc.  could even be a step toward and exploretype mission Ive always wanted  take a military unit and give it a barbarian hunter mission where it seeks out and attacks any barbs that are around.

The map is designed for that civ and it has amazing production and food once you unlock outback stations.Australia can build outback stations on deserts plains and grassland so you can basically colonise any part of the map except for tundra. Using this ability I created an empire that covered all of Oceania south Africa and the Americas with each city being  population and  production. BTW good game plan to colonise the Americas you can chop down rainforests in Brazil to jumpstart population and production and colonising NA will give you the Panama Canal super good if you want become a global naval power as well as really good tiles to settle on the West Coast and Mississippi RiverAustralia is without a doubt SSS tier. might be some Aussie pride involved but I assure you this is an amazing civ,civ,dgbek5y,6,t5_2rk3b

11656965,0,t1_dghazfr,gtTo comment on a couple of your ideas. A civ wont trade its last luxury unless you give them everything. Its not worth it to try. Im quite certain a civ doesnt cares about your military in trade deals. Ive been a ruler of the world and cant trade anything. If the luxury is listed in the trade window for you to offer to a civ it means they dont have it. If they do have it it wont be available in that screen.These are very helpful to know actually thank you!Also I turtled most of the game but in  when Russia wouldnt trade Open Borders with me without asking for an arm and a leg along with it I finally snapped and crushed her in  turns. After that I got zero deals for the rest of the game. Long story short I had the same experience as you from being a warmonger.I dont get how other civs will war off and on even obliterate people get denounced for it yet spring back all the same. I am peaceful and go to war once offer to negotiate for peace every single turn while at war but am an ostracized black sheep anyways.Thanks for the mod pack recommendation. Seems like its very cool.

As far as the show goes I havent watched all of it but my takeaway so far is that the heavy handedness is suppose to mirror how silly his kids show use to be I can look past that even if its cringey. I think the politics of it are on point and are designed to get the  crowd even more motivated to engage in politics honestly I think thats the point of the show. This isnt a science show and never really claimed to be it claims its to help save the world and it might. As far as changing minds I dont think thats the point conservatives or republicans that could benefit from the lessons in the show were never going to watch it any way just like liberals and democrats arent tuning in to Fox and Friends.Edit I really dont understand why Im being downvoted. Is it because a woman singing openly about sex and her vagina doesnt repulse me or offend my delicate patriarchal ears? Or is it because I acknowledge sexuality is a spectrum?
