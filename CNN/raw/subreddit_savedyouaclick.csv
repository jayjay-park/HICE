I mean it was pretty much the American Navys brightest hour  a relative triumph against an overwhelmingly superior foe in the end goal of defending a carrier fleet and prevent the deaths of hundreds of other American sailors. Maybe its because its so controversial and basically a result of a military error? That said I think Myeongnyang was an even more astonishing accomplishment but only because the more you know about how technologically superior the American navy was by that point in WWII and various other random things that broke in the Americans favor  such as the fact that the Japanese heavy ships were using armor piercing shells against American destroyers with thin belt armor instead of explosive shells which resulted in clean holes but little real destructive damage dealt. ,savedyouaclick,d82ws0x,5,t5_323r3

9282798,0,t1_d8skl6j,I like your style... and you make a few good points. I didnt imply that the consensus opinion is wrong because its a fallacy but I wanted to emphasize that just because there is a consensus it doesnt mean the theory is true or correct. Examples abound.Dr. Barry Marshall was ridiculed by the scientific community in the s for daring to suggest that stomach ulcer is caused by a bacterium H Pylori against overwhelming consensus. He was later awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine for his discovery.When Einstein was asked what he thought about the book A Hundred Authors Against Einstein he replied why a hundred? One is enough to prove me wrong. Einstein also used to say no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong.And one of my most favorite quotes from the great Richard Feynmann Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.The thing is there is overwhelming evidence indeed that the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming theory is deeply flawed. The models have failed and yet were still using them as the source of absolute truth. We lament the polar bear numbers but the truth is we have no idea how many polar bears there are in the world. We simply dont know. We use computer models to guess estimate their numbers. And then use those numbers as irrefutable proof.Any statistician or data scientist worth his or her salt will tell you that all models are wrong some models are useful.If you dig deeper than editorialized news you will discover that the overwhelming consensus is not and the causes of global warming are very much disputed among real scientists. Of course most of them wont admit that because they likeneed their jobs.,savedyouaclick,d8snucf,1,t5_323r3

I appreciate this conversation in the same way like an after action report. Putting my Parisian experience in the appropriate context.There was one night of the week that I spent in Paris where I interacted with local Frenchmen. They were extremely reticent until I started sharing personal information. Im from New Orleans my mother speaks Acadian French I served in Djibouti with French military I was visiting during one of our election years because I respect their culture an opinions as an ally and wanted to know what they think about everything. After sharing that information they opened up a lot and started being really friendly. It was a great evening.Other than that the only people I interacted with were either expats living in France or French who had spent time in America and were used to some random dude with a Southern accent smiling like dufus trying to make friends.I thought I was prepared for it because New Orleans and the South in general are very similar. What is your family name? Where did you go to school? What do you do? People here are reticent about becoming friendly until theyve established some sort of link. I was warned about that with the French and thought I was prepared. But I wasnt.That veil lifting in your last paragraph that was the insight the CanadianAmerican woman that I met a couple nights before I left gave to me. Everyone that I met wanted to know about me why I decided to go to Paris about my life in America. But they wouldnt ask. They didnt want to risk it. Thats the perfect way to phrase it.You obviously have a different perspective than my own. I thought you were an Asian woman but youre a black dude married to one. Are you French or from a former French colony?Sorry for boring you. Thanks for your time and input! I look forward to hearing more of your perspective.,savedyouaclick,d93pf4c,1,t5_323r3

They think they are doing something noble by trying to make people more aware of what they are sharing but ultimately they end up being among the clickbaitiest articles of them all. On top of that someone like Yahoo picks up the article and runs with it changing the headline to be even worse and totally losing the point of the whole thing. They have since deleted it but this morning Yahoo linked to this article with their own headline of This Loophole Could Actually Keep Obama in the White House. Thats even worse than the original!

10834815,0,t1_ddxikfl,While I sympathize with you none of the actions you mentioned contributed to this. More manafcturing jobs for example were lost to automation than outsourced to Mexico NAFTA also opened up markets in Canada and Mexico making materials cheaper to buy for factories and more consumers to sell too. For the example of Obama since I can barely remember the Clinton era more undocumented immigrants left the country than entered and he deported more than any other president. Hell Reagan pushed for amnesty you know? Given also that most of these immigrants took migrant farm jobs I also doubt theyd affect youactually theyve helped contribute to your social security and Medicare by the taxes they pay into a system they cant benefit from.Unless you point to a specific regulation I dont see how that would change. Regulations by themselves are not bad its a regulation that companies cant just dump toxic waste into rivers and that banks cannot gamble away your life savings. HBs do get abused including by our presidents companies but there are a number of jobs they fill because there simply arent enough American candidates for them. Engineering for example we simply dont have enough due to bad education and a difficult degree program plus cost.When it gets real bad my generation will be paying for all your mistakes that you pushed onto us.

And if they dont thats fine too. Why would you want another human being to suffer because he cant afford treatment?Also paying for other peoples healthcare is kinda what insurance is. Healthy people essentially pay for the sick. Unless you pay more in insurance than the total amount they cover for your  medical treatments other people are paying for you. Oh and unlike single payer using insurers as middle man adds tons of overhead for profit margins administrative costs checking to see who qualifies for what coverage etc. Were all better off without that middleman and would actually pay less per GDP on health care without them.But muh free market you say? How can that market truly be free if a hospital literally cant refuse emergency treatment to someone who needs it?Who foots the bill afterwards when the thankfully not dead person cant afford it even after going bankrupt? A combination of taxpayer money oh no you paid for that person to not die! and bloated medical costs for the hospital to break even in other cases where there is an insurance companies to pay Oh no your premiums are higher because they transferred the cost back to you to save that person!Not to mention you dont really have time to shop around for the cheapest hospitals when youre about to die so you cant really expect a free market to regulate healthcare costs in favor of the average person.,savedyouaclick,dfd6zqn,22,t5_323r3

11539103,0,t1_dg2sc0n,There are different uses but heres why I still think my point can be valid. In the scenario I pitched its using the term exclusive to males as a negative. In this PMS comment example its using a term exclusive to females Exclusive in terms of men obviously dont get actual PMS as a negative. I could use other examples from both genders but its not about the specific example as much as the point about offense and censorship. There is no justifiable way I can demand that you not get offended.Thatd be idiotic on my part. I do wonder about if things would be better overall if it were possible for more people to get less offended. Something I like to say to calm myself down is Everyone has a legit reason to be angry but it doesnt mean you actually HAVE to be. Or similarly I have a right to be offended and respond in kind but should I do both? What is the best response here? What do i want to get out of my response?Youre catching me at a time where I am seriously tweaking and reevaluating the level of my responses to things. I find I never agree with the You cant understand argument. Even when I watched it put forward beautifully in that one South park episode. Without knowing my life experiences how could anyone say one way or another what Im capable of understanding?I think people underestimate our ability to empathize. Maybe its a need to basically say I need you to just hear me. Or we want to get across that our pain is significant because its ours and its important to us. Its like What do you know!? or You wouldnt understand. Its almost reflex even if it isnt necessarily true. Ive been ignored left out condescended to and been made to feel insignificant or at least less than capable by people. I think those experiences  line up with the bs you had to deal with.But I think we can agree this PMS comment wasnt aimed at you as an individual. It clearly is associated in your mind with those moments and clearly for good reason. I want to really stress I am not saying that you are wrong here. Youre absolutely right. Everyone is going to have their own way of coping or reacting. With your experiences you might be so inundated with stupid ass patronizing guys that its like Newtons law. After a lifetime of being subjected to this you are having a fairly equal but opposite reaction. You are totally justified. The mansplaining patriarchal crap hate that term bc its so often misused but it seems to be a very accurate description here is just ignorance possibly willful ignorance on their part.When I wrote you censor I knew I should have written if people are going to downvote and censor because I didnt mean you specifically. I just wanted to talk about the greater implications of what happens if were too quick to be offended especially if it leads to censorship like it did here. That doesnt mean you were too quick to be offended. Maybe Im not offended enough. Maybe if people arent offended enough then itll be like the broken windows theory. People start to treat it like its not just an offhand joke and it starts to inform our thoughts and actions. Maybe its all particular to certain individuals depending on their own biases and flaws.
