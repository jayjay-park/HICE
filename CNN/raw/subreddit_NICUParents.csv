888023,0,t3_2499jm,Hugs. Even though Im Deaf I have cochlear implants so I can hearspeak very well those alarms is super annoying and when I go home all I hear is the alarms and baby crying like a repeating echo.  Heres a little suggestion that may help...if the nurses KNOW that Evie has these episodes perhaps when youre there to turn down the alarm volume to very soft.  That way if you are holding her and you hear the alarm you can quickly look at the numbers and see if its within acceptable range.  Talk to the nurse practitioners and ask them why Evie keeps getting them and why is she still on nose cannula? Is she being weaned off of it changing numbers to room oxygen? Etc.  The more you know the better you may feel.  Talk to them talk to your favorite nurse that you are having anxiety issues.  They may and should help you. They may have tried to lower the numbers but Evie wasnt responding to treatment so they had to keep it steady for a while and try again in a few days.  I had bad baby blues twice and I was very supported by many nurses and many nurses were more than willing to answer my questions and help me even silly ones like Uh. I dont know how to change a diaper. If you need time off away from NICU take it.  I did this twice. The next day my milk supply went up even though I pumped throughout my break.Again hugs your way.,NICUParents,ch57zkp,1,t5_30u9j
1189854,0,t3_27qxag,My husband and I were married in October of  and by December of  we were expecting our first child. My pregnancy was troubled throughout I was on and off bedrest and I can remember reading in my What to Expect when you are Expecting book that at  weeks gestation the baby is at the age of viability.  I hoped bargained and prayed each day to reach  weeks.  On the day I turned  weeks gestation my water broke.  It turns out I had an misdiagnosed clotting disorder and my placenta abrupted.  The clotting disorder that prompted by early labor also stopped the abruption.  A litany of professionals came to see me to convince me to let nature take its course or you can have other children.  With this statement I became angry and I looked at the Obstetrician and said I dont think you understand I read to her I sing to her I talk to her...she is as real to me as your children are to you.  You will save my baby.   hours after the steroids I became septic and my choice was made for me.  The only chance she would have is if I delivered her it was the hardest decision I have ever made.  I did not know what to expect they told me that they didnt know if they would try to save her that she had to meet criteria be gtlb cry etc.  She was lb oz pink and had a soft but strong cry.  They gave her the surfactant and I saw her precious face and I would not see it again without tape and tubes for  months.  Her NICU stay was the proverbial rollercoaster ride.  She had her good days and days in which she was so ill I didnt know how I could continue to be so selfish to want her to live when she struggled and worked so hard to simply breathe.  I couldnt hold her in those early days the only thing I could do to be close to her was to read to her.  I would sit by her side with my hand on her diapered bottom and read.  I made it my mission to do what I could to bring her home.  I pumped breast milk every two hours I brought in articles and books on prematurity.  I requested to have an order to kangaroo her while she was on the ventilator and I requested to do nonnutritive nursing.  With time she grew and exactly  days later we were able to bring her home.  At  months old she weighed lb oz and was on oxygen.  She developed Bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to her long intubation and I was warned she may always need oxygen and that she may never run or ride a bike.  Today she is  on a school trip with her school band she plays the trumpet.  She won most determined for the sixth grade PE class.  She makes straight As and won four academic awards.  She went to the county spelling bee is in advanced math and loves Silent Movies Stephen King and British Pop.  She is empathetic and kind.  She loves her sister her dog and when we go out of town her only request for a souvenir is a chocolate bar.  I hope that some of you read this when you are on the NICU rollercoaster and have hope for a brighter tomorrow.,NICUParents,ci3h73m,10,t5_30u9j
2976225,0,t3_2u8pyu,I worried about this too! And still do with our daughter who was in NICU. But the reality is you will be there every day with your baby caring for him talking to him tracking his health holding him feeding him your milk if you are lucky enough to get a good supply going and being a mama just as much as you can although not at home. Its heartbreaking and difficult not to be there  definitely. But you can and will definitely make up on lost time once home. To be honest I believe our LO now sleeps better throughout the night as she was not stimulated by us at that time of day. I believe as long as your son feels you there regularly lovingly and genuinely. He knows your voice your smell.. You are already there for him  ,NICUParents,co6ev95,2,t5_30u9j
3707306,0,t1_cqeuejx,Yeah I looked online a bit and Im reading that its only month while in the NICU and income limits dont apply because the hospital is considered his home. Its a special case. But now Im also reading that medicaid depends on state is the big bonus. Apparently the medicaid will step in and pay for all kinds of copays. Im going to have to check to make sure Im getting those medicaid benefits. Sheesh I wish the social worker there wasnt so clueless about this stuff.,NICUParents,cqeuwo6,1,t5_30u9j
3765841,0,t1_cqki0ub,My HS theology teacher became a womanpriest shes not exactly welcome by the Vatican right now and we had her come by to pray with us and anoint Lily on the same day all the bad news came down. She was so incredible and such a lifesaver to have there and be a calming voice when we needed it. Shortly after that we brought in our deacon who did my sons baptism and Lilys godparents and did her baptism and everything kinda smoothed out after that. Gonna chalk it up to a mixture of really good faith and really good medicine.,NICUParents,cqlj8rq,1,t5_30u9j

5702776,0,t1_cvngn5o,My son was slow to start breathing also!  But one day he will start breathing and never look back!     Stay strong!    That will be another great day like today,NICUParents,cx3zguj,1,t5_30u9j
5713117,0,t1_cx52xfi,There was a little shop run by a neonatal charity in our NICU that sold these. After walking past them every day on my way in to NICU I had to buy one. You could probably get something similar online though,NICUParents,cx59nst,1,t5_30u9j
6048835,0,t3_3y8spi,Our NICU has PTOT that specialize in infants.  They were so helpful not only in the early days to evaluate my  weeker but now to help us recognize little things that if we dont work on now will become bigger later.  From them I have learned that preemies babies who were on oxygen for long periods of time and babies with bad reflux my son has a trifecta here tend to overuse their back muscles and not use their stomach muscles enough.  And sure enough  at  months adjusted the kid wants to stand up and just skip the crawling stage.  I dont know about your daughter but my son doesnt love tummy time.  So we are altering it so he still gets the benefits but he isnt just a little boat rocking on his tummy.  We are encouraging him to use his core muscles more than he wants to and also doing some basic stretches and motions.  If he wants to stand he gets put into a crouching position where he has to use his core to push up.  He shows a slight tendency to look to the left over the right so we are working to even that out as well.  I know other NICU babies have other issues but those are just the ones that I have personal knowledge with.  If your baby was in the NICU for  months Im sure that you could get some physical therapy sessions covered if you have your pediatrician write up a referral.  There might be some really easy things that you can do now that would help avoid future issues.  ,NICUParents,cyci8r7,1,t5_30u9j
6401573,0,t3_439hlw,Born at  weeks exactly discharged after  days in the NICU. I asked if we got a pony or something if we hit  days. Nah.,NICUParents,czhalo2,2,t5_30u9j
6593116,0,t3_45ypvm,My twins had lots of apnea and bradycardia episodes. They never coded but those alarms went off all. the. damned. time. We were the ones scaring our neighbors. But we were far from the worst case scenario in the NICU. There can be a lot of survivors guilt. When you are in the scariest situation of your life and your heart is torn apart by the struggle your baby is going through when you think you cant take another day then you see someone that has it worse well it can be humbling. Remember everyones struggle is their own. Your struggle and your journey shouldnt be minimized because you see someone that has it worse. And its ok to feel grateful without carrying guilt. I guess what I mean is that just because your situation isnt as bad as theirs doesnt mean your situation isnt hard. And also remember that each baby that is in there is just where they need to be. Its scary and humbling and upsetting but remember how fast hisher team reacted and what great care that baby received. Theyre just where they need to be. ,NICUParents,d01a6bw,5,t5_30u9j
6599777,0,t1_d01y0de,Yes it sure is. More than once the neonatologists recommended a treatment based on medical studies done in just the last  years. Our kiddo is now  weeks adjusted  months old in real time and weighs about  lbs slightly up from his lb oz birth weight. We remain on a tiny amount of oxygen and he has left vocal cord paresis from either the ventilator or the PDA surgery. Hopefully both of those issues will selfresolve over time. But other than that the doctors we had in the NICU and since we busted out tend to use the words miracle and remarkable more liberally than I would expect. He seems to be on track with nearly everything and were watching for each developmental milestone like hawks. It has been quite a trip to watch him grow from literally one of the tiniest humans alive to a often happy sometimes fussy and always hungry butterball of a boy. How are your  weekers? ,NICUParents,d01yyjb,2,t5_30u9j

8640419,0,t3_4wv26s,Just try to remember that two steps forward and one step back is still one step forward. And one step is huge.  It might take x as long but if youre anything like us you just want her to make it. As long as it takes youll get there together!,NICUParents,d6lntqf,1,t5_30u9j
9893081,0,t1_dax2493,Great idea about starting off calls saying everything is fine if it is. I hate hearing the panic in a parents voice when they pick up seeing the NICU number. It makes me feel awful knowing they are running through worst case scenarios in their head before I can even explain why Im calling. I admire your strength for making it through your NICU experience!!!,NICUParents,dax3baf,2,t5_30u9j
