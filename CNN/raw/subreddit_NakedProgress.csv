792712,0,t1_cguc781,As far as diet goes I cut out all unecessary sweets including diet soda and by unecessary I mean any sweets that arent naturally sweet like fruits. I started being conscious of what my body had to go through to process anything that I put into it and cut out most processed or salty foods with the exception of cheese on occasion. Im a big snacker which was hard to overcome. I still snack like Im a starving chihuahua on the Serengeti but I keep an ample supply of cooked and raw fresh vegetables at hand as well as almonds. I eat to satiate not to fill. I eat less meat and more plants.Exercise Cardio was the bane of my existence when I started cutting weight off. I didnt want it at all and was just lifting weights. While my strengh was increasing my body shape was not changing in the slightest because I had layers of fat that needed removing. I accepted that my goal was to be in shape not to be a beefcake and I got on the stairstepper. I think I started at  minutes a day and it felt like running a marathon. Every week I increased my time per day by  mins until I reaced roughly a half hour. At this point I was able to run  miles at a comfortable rate and Ive increased gradually since. My first half marathon is in July. My time spent at the gym is minimal but I do try to get  hours a week of weight training in. Not much but its also not my priority.,NakedProgress,cgudvft,2,t5_2to3t

Im sorry its not been fast enough for your liking but if I had said it had been over a day time span.would you still be a Dick? Come on. Literally the last thing im doing is fishing for compliments. I promise you I would not put my body with which I have a pretty awful relationship out into the universe lightly or to garner undeserved praise. I requested feedback. If youre trying to discourage people by shitting on the progress they have made however small youre certainly not helping them feel encouraged to continue. Like honestly what the fuck is your problem? Truly go fuck yourself. Its fine if you dont see progress but I dont see why you need to attack my methods or secondguess my motives?

5896655,0,t1_cxsje1i,The first thing I did was figure out how much I could eat to lose weight. Find your Total Daily Energy Expenditure TDEE which is the amount of energy you use in a day just maintaining your current body composition.Use this And be HONEST about your activity level. Most are either sedentary or lightly active. I can only say Im moderately active because now I work out  times a week for  hours each session and do HIIT cardio along with walking around a tonne at my job. For losing weight err on the side of the lower. Once you have your TDEE subtract  calories from that. Thats the amount youll need to eat every day to lose lb of fat per week.DIET IS  OF WEIGHT LOSS. Training only makes up the other .Then go to myfitnesspal.com and sign up for an account. Use that to record everything you eat and track your calories accurately. Get used to weighing your food. The best way to know how much youre eating? Make it yourself dont fall for a takeout meal cook your own and you know just how much youve consumed.The most important thing is sticking to it. Dont give up after a week or two or three not even after two months. Weigh yourself on the same day of the week in the morning after youve gone to the toilet but before you eat or drink anything at all. And dont be discouraged if your weight fluctuates. My weight can differ by up to lb per day! Its because you might be carrying extra water still have food in your stomach or waste in your bowels or many other things. Keep at it and your weight will keep going in a downward trend even if every now and then it says youre a few lbs heavier than last week. If for three weeks the scale doesnt change or goes up THEN you take  calories off your limit and eat at that.TRAININGWhen I first started I did cardio every day.  Minutes on the elliptical or treadmill keeping a constant pace. I also trained weights every day before I learned that you should allow a day of rest between full body weight sessions where you only do cardio.Look up Starting Strength Stronglifts x or Jason Blahas Ice Cream Fitness x and chose one of those weight programs to do. Do  minutes cardio every day as well at a constant pace. Doesnt have to be running I did a fast walking pace on an incline and sweated like hell during Also dont think its alright to eat back the calories the treadmill says youve burned theyre VERY inaccurate and you shouldnt be looking for excuses to eat more or youll end up overeating by trying to justify it.For a far better written guide then I could ever write go here and read it ALL The number one rule in my books is this Be consistent and dont ever give up.,NakedProgress,cxsl3ae,2,t5_2to3t
