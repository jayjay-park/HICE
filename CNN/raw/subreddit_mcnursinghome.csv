4734286,0,t3_3fqwwx,Like I said El and myself have work on just now. Please refer to my thread I made CLICK I cannot do anything on the server myself as Im away until the end of August. I  do not expect you to wait it out.I promise we will get back on track then.In the meantime I can give you whitelist permission so you can advertise the server and try to get people on. I just simply dont have the time.What would you suggest?Im really sorry about this.,mcnursinghome,ctras89,3,t5_360zw

4871584,0,t3_3hjz79,yassIm on my way to your base right nowwill check things out Edit I think the problem is that the room you have your villagers in is too close to the villager with the doors I think they need to be  blocks above the villager with the doors. maybe build a temporary elevator that takes them up to a temporary holding cell like  blocks up or something. or you could drop them down. Not sure if any of this is actually correct but it makes sense that other villagers cant be within  blocks up and down of the villager with the doors. right?idk lol,mcnursinghome,cu8lmqc,1,t5_360zw
5073584,0,t3_3khibx,Personally ive only occasionally noticed lag. Just little things like half a second chat delay or sometimes ill pick something in my inventory and itll jump back to where it was and suddenly im holding some random item.,mcnursinghome,cuxk4ok,1,t5_360zw

7003792,0,t3_4bktrb,I keep coming back to this thread so figure I might as well comment already. The server was due for a reset was it sudden? Yes. Was everyone absolutely thrilled about it? No. But more people were on today then wouldve been otherwise without the reset the only people on wouldve been a few random whoevers and some people afking at end game grinders. A server cant go forever without resetting to expect that is unrealistic. Sure some notice wouldve been nice but once Dan made the post everyone didnt want to play on a next day dead map so Dan reset it quickly which I was against at first but I see why he did it. Today has been the most enjoyable time Ive had on the server ever just being at spawn with everyone was just a lot better then being s of blocks out from everyone. The reset was needed and I see why people are upset and if you choose to quit then ok but just give it a shot at least. If you dont then see ya around sometime maybe.,mcnursinghome,d1a83ax,3,t5_360zw
7240042,0,t3_4elesp,this sounds like a continuation from the rant i heard last night from dantes. Idk any server who doesnt have afkers. its part of the game. and since we already have spigot screwing up our range of opp on our farms. its to the point its forced to get your farms to work rather than it being able to work while your doing things.,mcnursinghome,d2151vz,2,t5_360zw
