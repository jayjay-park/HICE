For online resources I have heard great things about Khan AcademyAssuming you are tracking useful metrics the more consistent you are with tracking and the more data you accumulate over time the easier it will be to identify patterns. Contextual notes are also very helpful since nothing we do happens in a void. The hard part is contextual notes arent always easily trendable but when you do see a pattern they can help explain why it exists.Another big challenge is aggregating data from different tracking sources into a common format. It will be really difficult to compare data from different apps if you have to do a lot of manual cleaning and formatting to get the data into a common spot for analysis. That part of the process is a little data science and a lot of work.Im in the midst of building a tool to do exactly what you are describing. We started with capturing HRV sleep and exercise and are expanding in the next few months to include many more metrics integrations and an automated but flexible analysis dashboard like the one you describe. We currently have one for teams but are building one for individuals.Go simple first and then complex over time. Cheers,QuantifiedSelf,d1siezx,3,t5_2sivw

11666132,0,t1_df4rutp,gt rity the I agree wholeheartedly with you on point . Im actually trying to build a startup around this.In regards to point  do you track things such as blood pressure because you know it can lead to very particular insights? Or are you hoping to find associations between the data and your health after examining what youve recorded?,QuantifiedSelf,dgiddhf,1,t5_2sivw
