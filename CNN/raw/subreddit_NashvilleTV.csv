266588,0,t3_1x5547,I usually dont like Teddy but his face at the end of the episode was great.,NashvilleTV,cf8e3zk,5,t5_2v7nl
690712,0,t3_2227sj,How is Scarlett getting these pills?  I know Liam started her off on them but he hasnt been around for a while.  Theyre obviously some sort of prescription and I doubt she has a doctor prescribing her enough that she could abuse them this much.  She doesnt really seem like the sort of person that hang around with drug dealers.,NashvilleTV,cgisb3t,8,t5_2v7nl
693213,0,t3_222ryg,I havent seen or heard any ratings info on NASHVILLE. Is it in danger of being canceled?? I just discovered it on hulu and blew through the first season and am trying to take my time on the second because I love it so much!,NashvilleTV,cgj2jkx,8,t5_2v7nl
2091441,0,t3_2ia5wc,Adios Old Friend is definitely my favorite with It Aint Yours to Throw Away as a close second.,NashvilleTV,cl5o28c,2,t5_2v7nl
3097761,0,t3_2vlt6t,I cant wait for Hayden to have more scenes. Shes my favorite. I really could not care less about the Sadie crap. Go away Sadie. Theres already enough drama in Nashville.,NashvilleTV,coj2yi9,4,t5_2v7nl
3818515,0,t3_345jl2,Im still pretty partial to If I Didnt Know Better.  The early Gunnar and Scarlett stuff is definitely my favorite.,NashvilleTV,cqrji45,10,t5_2v7nl

7067156,0,t3_4cajtl,I agree I also think its time we see Daphne get something of her own and not only be a sidekick to all the other people and experience their problems and somehow make them relate to yourself. Sure at that age you still idolize your sister and your mom but there must be something else in her life?Maybe its because she was always been the cute little sister maybe a bit spoiled by her dad and now hes gone the family dynamic she knew is gone and her bigger sister doesnt want to be in a band with her and only sing and write just with her.Now I feel whiny as well! edited for grammar,NashvilleTV,d1hfaps,2,t5_2v7nl

10938520,0,t3_5w2yui,What is with Juliettes hair?With those buns you think she was paying a tribute to Princess Leia not Rayna James. ,NashvilleTV,de88clw,6,t5_2v7nl
11009932,0,t1_de7h8tq,Im with you on this. Im suddenly struggling to find any characters I actually do like. Avery? Daphne maybe? Uhhh...Deacon when he isnt off the wagon? Thats about it. When I really think about it all the rest range from mildly irksome to making me want to scream at my screen irritating. Looking at you Maddie.,NashvilleTV,defy1bo,4,t5_2v7nl
