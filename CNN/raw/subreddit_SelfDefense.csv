I would avoid any flashlight that has intentional DNA Collectors blades spikes etc on the bezel.Theyre overdesigned and given the general restrictions on weapons in the UK its a good idea to just avoid them.,SelfDefense,cvds8ac,1,t5_2r6i0
5826314,0,t3_3ug17k,It depends on how firearms are treated in your jurisdiction.  For example here in Canada a firearm is always a lethal weapon it can never be considered anything else until it is destroyed and is no longer a firearm.Beyond just legality you need to consider how people will react.  They dont know the gun has rubber bullets or bear bangers or whatever.  You can very easily end up in a situation where you feel scared pull out your gun the other person says Oh shit hes gonna kill me! and tries to kill you in self defense.You absolutely should never view a gun as being a magic talisman you can wave around to hold monsters at bay.  The only time you should ever point a gun at someone is if shooting them is the most reasonable course of action that will prevent them from doing an equal or greater amount of harm to someone else.Why is it that you want to get a guntaser?  What are the core concerns at the root of the issue?,SelfDefense,cxjcsrp,1,t5_2r6i0

9121221,0,t1_d885q4j,Youve missed my point. Either deliberately or you read my post too quicklyI am indeed completely certain that being in great shape is a massive advantage in fights. I dont disagree with that.But selfdefence is very different from competition fighting. Preparing for one is very different from preparing for another. As I inferred before Im certain that preparing for competition fighting prepares you well for selfdefence. But mostly as a sidebenefit. Not a focus.Over the years Ive spent time in several gyms that teach muay thai. And I havent found one that focuses on selfdefence. ,SelfDefense,d887zw3,1,t5_2r6i0
9127511,0,t1_d887zw3,Well that kind of training gives you a physical and mental toughness and set of straightforward and effective but not too fancy techniques that builds your muscle memory. And you also get used to being hit and still be able to continue the fight. Thats what counts the most for self defense in my opinion . And when you get hit hard enough whether in the ring  or  outside you dont think and plan a course of action but use the simplest set of moves youve got stashed deep inside your skull. I think when it comes to self defense most people lacks first courage and second strength and stamina to overpower the opponent and then third would be some special techniques that you may use especially when you feel like youre dominating the fight. I would not overestimate special techniques though  theres a reason why you dont see Steven Seagal kind of moves outside of a movie set or a choreographed fights. And obviously when theres more than one guy you would rather kick and back or punch and back instead of getting into wrestlinggrappling fight,SelfDefense,d88z850,1,t5_2r6i0
