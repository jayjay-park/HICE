Both songs have been played constantly for months now if there are any songs closest to being finished its those. Its one of the few theories that make sense and its the ONLY album theory with any info to back it up. Im down and pumped.Hes constantly in the studio with new people EVERY DAY laying down new tracks. You are all entitled to your opinion and can be as skeptical as you like.

744149,0,t3_22ohnw,I love Skrillexs music because its detailed and you can tell a lot of time went into it especially the synthesizing part.I listen to all electronic music. Diplo deadmau Alesia Porter Robinson Noisestorm you name it I like it. Why? I like all artists because since I began to get interested in edm production a rough  or so months ago the means of which artist produce their tracks never cease to amaze me. Skrillex for example is very musical has a lot of details in his songs and his synthesizers are incredibly unique. Artist like deadmau are detailed as well but more in the progression of their song. House is a bit more focused on melodychord progession then dubstep or dnb is. So that being said deadmau can make some beautiful sounding saws with absolutley perfectly spaced chords. Not one song have I heard of his or Skrillys were the bass was strong as well as the melody synths and the drums were beautifully made or sampled. Basically theyre amazing at both production and masteringmixing.,skrillex,cgov6qa,5,t5_2s7cz

4480682,0,t3_3cgeki,I have solved it guys this video has enlightened me.   are the alt codes for each individual letter in Jack . Entering  on google leads to a lone website. As seen in the site the sine of  is ..Add every digit and you get  add these  digits and you get  which is Mind feat. Kai on the Jack  album. If you look at the last song on the Gypsyhook Ep youll find Kai sui which is the Japanese version of Mora. The music video for Mora was released in  and adding these numbers together we get  and these we get  which is the track number for Mora. So lets round everything up... Our key numbers here are  Mind track   Kai sui track  Mora track  and  again addition of digits in Mora video release year. So with these calculations we now know that the next skrillex album will be released in one of these years            !!! Of course these years exclude the Soon variable which not even Sonny himself knows the value of so lets keep our fingers crossed for !!!,skrillex,csvggzu,16,t5_2s7cz

I have decided to share this mashup but if i hadnt it would go crazy in my sets anyway so its my thing to give others something that i have worked on. Even if this is technically a remake it took me a least an hour to make drums that sound like something in a live video and in the end get everything to a commercial loudness level. I guess you get what i wanna say its my work and as long as the original isnt released i can do whatever i want with it and so is the acapella of that guy rspeeds ,skrillex,ct238v1,-1,t5_2s7cz

People shouldnt be allowed to post their original songs just because they think a subreddit for a popular artist with  subs is the perfect platform to promote themselves.
