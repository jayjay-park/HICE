1685038,0,t3_2dornq,Id be really grateful if anyone could find the official Asian Black Bear. Years ago Blue Fang made a mobile phone game based on Zoo Tycoon in Java if you completed the game you got a link to download the bear for Zoo Tycoon  this was the only way you could get it. The link went down years ago and as a result finding the official Asian Black Bear is really difficult there are usermade ones avaliable but Im looking for the real thing.I remember finding the file ages ago and it worked fine but Ive since lost it again I think it might have been an .exe file as it was an official Blue Fang download like the addax. Has anyone got this file or knows where I can find it?,ZooTycoon,cjrk9p6,3,t5_2u12x
