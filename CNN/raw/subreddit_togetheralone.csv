2910630,0,t1_cnyrhoc,I would say that most girls are like that nowadays. they dont want to be hurt from being in a relationship and neither do you. just hit it off with a girls and slowly make moves. ,togetheralone,cnyy2k8,2,t5_2tb93
4819805,0,t3_3f9etd,I can relate to this a lot. Im on the fence between giving people the benefit of the doubt and being completely misanthropic. Ive spent years in mental health treatment and its clear that we are responsible for trying to meet and identify our needs. But that doesnt just go for people who have mental health issues it applies to everyone. With this knowledge I accept everyone is trying to do what is best for them which can seem sort of selfish outside looking in but it doesnt have to be that way. If giving people arms length distance is what works for you it works for you. You should try to analyze what things are healthy and what things arent. Im sorry to hear about your father as well. My father never physically left my family but mentally has been checked out for a while. He also said a lot of crappy things to me when I was too young to understand that he was the one with a problem not me. Those things my dad said to me then manifested as reality in high school and all the things he said to me were reflected in how people treated me. By the time I got to college I found it so hard to believe people meant well and werent shallow or out to get me. If paranoia and worrying is getting in the way of you having a social life then you might want to consider making it very clear to your therapist that this is an issue. Ask for skills you can learn. Sometimes reframing your thoughts can help you not continue the cycle that is holding you back from the life you want to be in. ,togetheralone,cu22qxo,2,t5_2tb93
