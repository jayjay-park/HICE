9924203,0,t1_db13gv0,The Lemon Party jokes cemented  Rock as my favorite thing. I didnt start watching until late  when it was on Netflix and I loved it right off the bat. But when they dropped semiobscure gay geriatric shock porn jokes into the christmas episode that was it.And in season  where Tracy is making the Harriett Tubman movie and Octavia thinks Tubman sounds too masculine and wants to change it to tubgirl. So good.,30ROCK,db15cwp,20,t5_2rgm3
