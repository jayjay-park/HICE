5007571,0,t3_3jflrn,I think this issue creates complications when it comes to safety as transgender students might feel threatened and uncomfortable in their schools. I have see articles regarding the socalled bathroom bills introduced by social conservatives in states such as Arizona Maryland Kentucky and Florida typically mandate that people use the bathroom that matches the sex on their birth certificate. That is difficult for transgender people as this bureaucratic indicator should not be weighed against their sense of self. There is only a number of states that let transgender people change their birth certificates. I think this element is important for their wellbeing in society.,medialaw,cuplnit,3,t5_39ljr

I personally think cookies and algorithms that personalize ads and search engine results is rather creepy but the internet is not really an environment in which a reasonable expectation of privacy is valid. Additionally the case is made weaker because the algorithms are not performed by humans to be used for emotional harm.,medialaw,cvebvcj,1,t5_39ljr
5830948,0,t3_3thqrk,A few points in this article seemed interesting to me. The first one is the certainty that peoples reactions nudity and sex on screen is very much different today then  years ago. The Miller Test was established in  and the society was very different at the time. The second is that the notion of sex is not just about that. It is also seen as a comment on societys values human desire or artistic expression. This omnipresence of sexually explicit scenes could be viewed as worrying and harmful to the society. However some countries have taken a different perception of things and take this content as a way to start discussions for the younger generation. If you see if from this aspect I feel you could justify the redeeming social value. ,medialaw,cxjyp12,1,t5_39ljr
11643763,0,t3_634epa,Seems like this person doesnt have a case.  First of all given that Beyonce took  lines and made an entirely different song out of em incorporating those lines almost certainly qualifies as transformative use.  Second the samples taken from the plaintiff and her brother were a tiny portion of their work as a whole so its unlikely that the use was substantial.  Third I highly doubt Beyonces use of footage from a virtually unknown artist damaged the market value of the artists work  if anything it probably vastly increased the audience which that work reached.,medialaw,dgfu1gm,1,t5_39ljr
