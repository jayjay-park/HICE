7755605,0,t1_d3hzvqe,I love this idea. Allot every castle a value based on placement on the map so all of the countries start with a certain number of castle points. Imagine if countries picked in rounds! Depending on the game difficulty the AIs could use different strategies from trying to draft original country to agressively drafting close to another country early on. Once youre out of points youre done drafting but any castles leftover at the end are given to whomever has least castles first then it would go in draft order starting from .EDIT whomever,brigandine,d3nr5mi,3,t5_31z8j
