There are more wolves on the map than there are bullets and the wolves respawn.

It has to be something where you have to habe mastered surviving on the go which is harder than setting up a base.  A long trek.  Some hope.  Some goal.  Survival becomes too easy after a while.

5216679,0,t3_3mgmwy,This thread happens every couple of days there are definitely people who want this.The acute problem with stalker is simply too much loot. Food especially is too plentiful meaning you dont need to hunt meaning your other supplies dont get used.The real core though is learning maps is OP. A huge amount of the games challenge lies in not knowing the optimal place to go. But despite spawn randomization veterans can always just hit the major facilities and trust that there will be enough gear to win.So the true hard mode would cut lot of the loot out of major facilities and fully randomize loot spawns. Force scarcity and exploration rather than a checklist of reliable spawns.,thelongdark,cvesw36,1,t5_2ygr3
5221011,0,t1_cvfazd0,Yep along the left though you have to cross to it from the right side where one or two of the train carts are acting a bridge between both sides.There is usually a dead body with some loot where you need to cross when you manage to get across that keep following the path around and you should see the wooden train bridge Coastal Highway isnt that far of a walk after that. ,thelongdark,cvfbnri,2,t5_2ygr3
5257972,0,t3_3mx7vx,Nice! Im on day  and its the longest Ive survived so far. I spent the first  in the Camp Office at Mystery Lake and then moved out to Coastal Highway for the second  days. Ive only fired  shots during those  days I would guess as  were used to kill two bears neither one even touched me I was thrilled and one on a wolf. The rest of the time Ive been trying to headshot wolves that have taken down a deer with my bow. Emphasis on trying as I only make maybe  of those shots and end up having the arrow go through the wolf and then I get mauled just a teensy bit. The worst was when an arrow got stuck in the wolfs leg and I was following it around waiting for it to die for about  hours. This was my only arrowhead so I couldnt give it up. It was really uncomfortable following him around as he limped. Its also fun when the arrow goes clean through and skitters away on the ice... Just now Ive made my first bearskin bedroll which feels like a huge accomplishment. Im going to continue looting Coastal Highway and exploring every nook and cranny and arranging the supplies I find in a nice manner inside one of the coastal homes. Once I hit day  Im going to try and figure out how to get to Pleasant Valley again since Ive completely forgotten. Hopefully  will be spent in the even newer area but well see how much longer I last... ,thelongdark,cvjrv3g,1,t5_2ygr3

I am playing on XBox One so maybe thats the only platform with this issue. One example of this. Call game A one I have played since before Halloween I got to  days and walked off a cliff and died on my way from CH to ML. So I start a new game B. I play B for two RL days and then the power goes out game B is deleted. This is strange since I saved it turned my XBone onoff several times in two days. At the same time my old game A is loaded but it loads it at a save that was a week before I died in it.This is one example. It has happened consistently with many games my BF and I play. I notice it will delete any new game and randomly revive old games if I quit the whole game mind you after saving when I switch my XBone to watch Netflix or something. If I leave it open in the background like a phone app it wont necessarily delete my games.Tldr I have major issues savingloading as well its glitchy.,thelongdark,cwumfld,1,t5_2ygr3

6245191,0,t1_cyzfobq,Valid points. However it would be cool as something to work towards. Maybe someone will create a mod to have seasons. I just think it would add a new aspect to survival. I think I read in another comment that we do not get affected by sweat. This is a real thing when hiking outdoors in the winter. I think there is some saying that sweat kills. Well I know in this game Ive built some fires that the output heat had me feeling like it was  but my temperature gauge never went into the red... Or I didnt have to remove some clothing so that I didnt sweat etc. Also I notice that many clothing items have description points that point out the item is worthless when wet. However we dont have anything that shows us if our clothing is wet or damp or moist. Like we dont have to lay out clothes by the fire to dry out a bit etc. I have noticed on the lakes that on the warm days its not as white and it is more blue. This makes me think the surface is almost more slushy as opposed to solid ice on top. My boots dont seem to wear out quicker when I walk through the changing lake surface. Just thoughts. I love this game as is. It can only get better from here. ,thelongdark,cyzidtz,2,t5_2ygr3

7110163,0,t3_4cqdzd,Day  I awoke near a patch of clearcut forest. I spent my first night in a watchtower atop a mountain.Day  I gathered all the supplies I could find from a dam nearly getting killed by a wolf inside in the process then migrated to a lake cabin where I spent the night.Day  In the morning I headed to a homestead I saw while flying over in search of people but had no luck. I spent the night there.Day  I journeyed back to the cabin and managed to find a vault along the way containing supplies a rifle and ammunition. I brought it back to the cabin with the rest of my findings.I will eat then prepare to head to the ravine and migrate to the highway on the other side. I plan to spend tonight in the dam and cross the ravine in the morning.I made it to the dam but had to leave some of my supplies at the cabin for another time. I was attacked by wolves on the way. One of them ended up getting a good bite in and I wasted a lot of ammunition. Ill wait at the dam until morning and continue my journey.Day  I awoke to relatively peaceful weather. I will continue my journey to the highway.I made it through the ravine and to the end of the train tracks but have yet to find the highway. I write this at the train unloading station while I eat and warm up. I will soon head back out to look for the highway and hopefully find help.I found the highway only to find all the houses have been abandoned. Im setting up camp at a gas station for now. There are plenty of ice fishing huts nearby so food shouldnt be a problem.Day  The weather is very harsh however I must make my way to the fishing huts. Food is starting to run low. I am also out of lantern fuel I will need to check around the old houses in town when I return.A wolf attacked me outside the gas station. I was unharmed and managed to kill it however I got cold while harvesting its guts. I will warm up before I go fishing.Just as I stepped out of the gas station again a blizzard hit. It looks like Ill have to wait it out.Day  I have gotten food poisoning from a can of peaches. I took some antiobiotics but Im not going to be able to fish today.

Everyone lives pretty spread out and once a month everyone comes in from the woods to a trading post. Everyone whos lived longer than three weeks has plenty of furs piling up.

The two I am thinking of are the narrow walkways in transition spaces and thin ice. This one time instances break apart the drudgery of survival and do encourage players to respond to situations. The greater variety of situations the better and more flexible a player becomes. Thats what survival is about adaptation. And I hope there are many of these noob traps in future zones. Also the door tells the player in some way with a sign that returning through it is not possible. So it also promotes the development of observation skills.

8697391,0,t3_4ycqn4,I uploaded another short TLD videoAnd I had a scary moment recently in CH. Although Ive played the game for hundreds of hours Im still mostly familiar with ML. But this playthrough I started in CH and am still determined to make a bearskin bedroll. Im trying for the wrapped in furs achievement.Anyway Id found a rifle by this point and one bear was down. I kept telling myself Id lay low and use up my meat before looking for another bear but I just needed to know what was out there and I got so bored after reading the books Id found one ice fishing one carcass harvesting. From my base in the gas station I went down the road even past the small fishing village. I kept going. Eventually I realised Id perhaps gone a bit too far. I didnt recognize anything around me. There were three hours of daylight left and I hadnt brought a bedroll with me. I began to freeze.Instead of backtracking I kept walking and heard a bear. I couldnt see it but I could hear its noises and footsteps. I didnt have a flare on me Id used it earlier against a wolf. I crouched all the way along a frozen trickle of a creek in the hopes it would lead me somewhere good a building to hide in? I kept going and the bear sounded further away. Yes! Then I discovered the Bear Creek campground. Seeing the work of the bear and knowing that Id just been near one made me paranoid. A ravaged deer lay near me. I couldnt pass that up so I harvested it. My fire starting failed four times and the sun was quickly setting. I kept thinking Id heard those heavy steps. Damn it why wont you start! Finally it did. I set about my work quickly and got out of there. As I was leaving I heard the bear rumble faintly. It still hadnt seen me yet so I ran for it. By then the stars were out. I found a corpse looted it then climbed up to the railroad and ducked into the cabin for the night safely away from that damn bear. Phew. I still hope to get it later so I can have my bedroll.,thelongdark,d6st011,2,t5_2ygr3

10056072,0,t3_5jmzqi,It depends on the level I am playing at.Everything other than interloper Pleasant Valley for all the reasons posted elsewhere here.Interloper Camp OfficeThe weather in PV is brutal and the lack of fishing opportunities can be very problematic even after you have a bow.Mystery Lake has all the resources you need nearby abundant cattails to have as an emergency store of calories and more sunny days to use your lens. Plus easy hassle free crafting.The only drawback is the distance from the forge. EDIT  this isnt even a problem now with the new zone. Id use Coastal Highway but the number of wolves gets old especially prebow. the only safe spot is fishing huts but you then have to have piles and piles of wood just to make anything.,thelongdark,dbibwsj,1,t5_2ygr3
10069181,0,t1_dbjv923,All your ideas are really awesome! I love the idea of making bait or lures!   Im okay with the character having no idea how to do anything but since they added the huntingfishing manuals so that your character can learn stuff we should be able to expect them to use bait for their hook or be able to dress a rabbit much quicker.

10675976,0,t3_5sl0y4,The carrying capacity in the game is not limited by the PACK but by how much it is reasonable to carry. The Pack is just a construct  a mental place to put stuff. The limit is imposed by encumbrance and how that is affected by how Fatigued you are.As others have said  choosing what to carry and what to leave behind is part of the calculus of survival. The Long Dark isnt like other games where you can carry a small townsworth of stuff with you wherever you go.TLDR You are not limited by what you can fit in the pack. A bigger pack wouldnt mean you can magically carry more weight before it affects your mobility. Be selective about what you carry with you.,thelongdark,ddh5a3j,3,t5_2ygr3

It was so much fun and exciting. The challenges make the game infinitely more engaging. Why havent I tried this any sooner?At one time I was walking around in the dark with a lit flare frantically looking around finger on the equip weapon button if the bear decided to charge. Easily my favorite part of this playthrough.A little bit later as Im coming out of the Dam the bear suddenly pops up. I shoot him and as he runs of I make my way down to the river when suddenly a wolf pops up. I light a torch to get him to back off. That bugger kept stalking me from a distance for the entire walk to the lake thats when he spotted a rabbit and ran off. Loved this!Took a quick pit stop at Camp Office before continuing my way to Trappers Homestead. My heart was pounding as I almost reached the end goal. I didnt see the bear anywhere but then heard the growling of a wolf. Luckily he didnt get really close and I just ran the last stretch.
