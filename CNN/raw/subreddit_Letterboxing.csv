1334469,0,t1_cihxy7r,Thank you. You are absolutely right. I am my own worst critic as it is with everyone.I have a similar cutter to the speedball one. The one I purchased was cheaper but still has the five interchangeable blades. Any idea what the slicer blade one is used for? Would that be similar to the use of an exact blade? Ive had no real luck using that thing.,Letterboxing,cijqsli,1,t5_2sjxp
