So by the time you get your ship into their area theyre already attacking your planets!  Having a partner on standby for defense would make it so much easier!,Spore,cgllfeq,1,t5_2qiv4
1294916,0,t3_28vuyo,Could you go through your entire installation process? Sometimes installing things in the incorrect order causes glitches.My order with the game workingInstall Core SPORE gt Install CreepyCute pack gt Install Galactic Adventures  Installing CreepyCute after GA causes major problems this bug has never been fixed. Open Game Allow it to install any patches it detects  If you want to be incredibly sure you have all the correct patches there is an archived patch list here  With Patch  on the same link without the archivedsporepatches after it  Note Their Patch page states that you need the EADM for Spore if youre running through Steam. This may be what is causing issues for you.  Note  You can get Patch . manually from their website here   You need Patch . to get Patch  Bot Parts  When game declares itself fully patched and up to date find the Dr. Pepper Bot Parts patch and then install it.  I came across a huge bug saying I was missing the core spore after doing this requiring a reinstall but miraculously all my patches survived O.o  I cant be sure if this method will work for you but it worked for me and Im running W.Quick Edit Try reinstalling the patches now that youre running the game through steam instead of Origin especially if they have different directories.,Spore,cifamdz,2,t5_2qiv4

4710802,0,t1_ctobr7r,blank starewhatSorry I was cAPS lOCKing earlier but patchrasite  should never have existed. Its not a patch merely an excuse to update the games version number. Unfortunately its loaded with lowlevel problems which will either make no difference or seriously ruin your day. It also prevents you from installing any real patches. Oh and dont even get me started on the crashes the parts can cause. What moron thought it was a good idea to make it possible to save a creature with no social abilities?? WHAT IS THE GAME EXPECTED TO DO WHEN THE PLAYER TRIES TO BEFRIEND SUCH A CREATURE IN THE CREATURE STAGE??...sorry just...dont touch that lump of cancer. I made a mod which adds the parts fixed to not cause socializationinduced crashes ofc with the fixed Darkspore models without the patch. Ill post a link later when I can get at my computer.Again sorry about all the cAPS lOCKing ,Spore,ctoc2nc,2,t5_2qiv4

7828257,0,t1_d3vy5b3,Digging up bone piles gives you a random part that you dont already own. Try not to move when digging up the bones because itll just cancel the animation and thus cancel getting the part Ive done that on multiple occasions by accident,Spore,d3vyo76,3,t5_2qiv4

9893536,0,t3_5h3fix,Here are my personal favoritesDark Injection .r  adds a metric crapton of stuff from Darkspore into Spore ranging from parts to ingame objects to UI. Still in Open Beta with more stuff being added with every release.Strange and Beautiful Parts Pack an assortment of parts inspired primarily by some of the strangest creatures on Earth.Himeric Engine an assortment of parts inspired by various depictions of aliens and possibly horror movie monsters as well.Spore Resurrection First Steps adds an assortment of original content mainly creature parts building parts and adventure props. Originally a demo of the nowcancelled Spore Resurrection Next Steps.The Smoother adds a limb which can be used to smooth out joints and sculpt a creatures body. Commonly mistaken for an invisible limb part due to how one must temporarily attach a hand to it to manipulate it properly then remove the hand for it to not animate like an armCamBens Color Pack adds an assortment of parts intended to help break free of Spores colour system by allowing you to create patterns manually or have multicoloured details and shapes.
