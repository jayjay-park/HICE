3114926,0,t3_2vrhde,Not as dark but not light either I am loving the everloving shit out of The Powder Mage Trilogy.   The tothepoint writing style kind of reminds me of Abercrombie.  Theres also a bit of an investigation aspect like in First Law.,TheFirstLaw,cokv10b,2,t5_2toq0
3447987,0,t3_2zn3pr,The BloodyNine is my favourite character for a sort of a sad reason.  His blacking out doesnt remind me of blocking out a horrific event more like blacking out from drinking.I used to have a pretty bad drinking problem and what was worst was that I would black out and not remember anything the next day.  My friends and SO would tell me about things I did and Id be so embarrassed and so mad that I couldnt control myself doing it because I felt like I wasnt even there when it happened.  I couldnt believe how much I empathized with Logan when he would turn back from the BloodyNine confused scared and angry with himself for doing something he doesnt remember doing.  And Logan couldnt even go sober  poor dude.  ,TheFirstLaw,cplap01,2,t5_2toq0
3465437,0,t1_cplap01,Hey man weve all been there ive lost count on the number of times ive blacked out in college and for a few years after.  I woke up one morning on the rd story of a house being built.  Went to get down before someone saw me and I couldnt find a ladder or staircase anywhere.  So apparently I am spiderman when i black out.  But Im not gonna say us blacking out is anything like what logan has.  The dude wakes up to the death of his best friends.  We wake up to throwing up in a friends car.  They are hardly the same.,TheFirstLaw,cpna9dw,1,t5_2toq0
3505642,0,t3_2ydz6v,I love BSC just for this reason. Honestly there was a point about  of the way through where I wanted Monza to just stop. I think the book makes a good overall point about revenge and violence. Abercrombie pretty much says You want gore and death and blood? Okay here it is. It really made me question why I liked reading these novels  kind of similar to the ending of Inglorious Basterds  you get this whole build up to this big vengeful moment and then when it comes youre like holy shit I never wanted this! I think it was really well done in terms of tackling the theme of revenge and still stands out as one of my favorites in the series.The Heroes is great  I envy you reading it for the first time.,TheFirstLaw,cprv9dj,1,t5_2toq0
5845119,0,t1_cxlbcpa,I like the out of the box characters. I need to reread! And Hal stands out because we miss out on traditionally good characters which makes him a tad refreshing.,TheFirstLaw,cxltm8b,1,t5_2toq0
6576842,0,t1_czzeukk,This is a great answer. I was personally more disappointed in the ending of the second book as I felt like the lets get the seed story was a waste of everyones including my own time however when they finally recover and use the seed in the rd book the bad assity that occurs made me forget any prior distaste for the series. I agree that nobody changed but that is to me a big theme  of these books so far  I am almost done with best served cold. Everyone in the first trilogy has large flaws that they never made any effort to work on. ,TheFirstLaw,czzll2t,3,t5_2toq0
