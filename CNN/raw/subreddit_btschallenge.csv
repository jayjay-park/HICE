1714554,0,t3_2dxgo5,Hey! mrosebud here melanieftw on MFP.  FSW CW GW   MFP has been my main resource all along. The fittest I have ever been was in high school marching band. Other than that I have not been too active. Ive tracked calories off and on for the past year and a half and and recently starting over. I refuse to reach lbs again. My main trouble is sticking it out after a bad eating day where I go over my limit so I think this should really help out. Looking forward to everyones success!,btschallenge,cjva5dz,6,t5_332p1

2238927,0,t3_2kgwns,Last week was fine. I went out to eat with the fam and managed to end the day with a calorie deficit. Didnt lose this week in pounds or inches but I didnt get to workout as much as I wanted to with my knee being touchy so Im sure this week will be better.On days when I dont feel like it Ill either put on the workout clothes just to see if maybe I really do feel like working out or Ill put on this really cute dress that I got two months ago that looks great on me and has slowly gotten a little bit looser but still really cute and remind myself how far Ive come and that I dont want to go back to not liking how I look.,btschallenge,clof66s,1,t5_332p1
