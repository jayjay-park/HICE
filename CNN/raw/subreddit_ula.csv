3949525,0,t3_35nlvk,Some obvious flaws Wheres the upper stage going to come from in the first place? Vulcan will significantly improve the capability envelope while decreasing prices. Its the combination of the two that makes it a good idea. Since this new Atlas V would have roughly the same capabilities the only chance of it competing with SpaceXs Falcon  would be by significantly cutting the costs to an even greater extent than Vulcan you cant ask for the same money as Vulcan while only offering the capability of F. But even having the AR completely for free would be insufficient unless the upper stage is cheap. Except that if the upper stage is cheap it wont be as well performing as the Centaur...certainly not without a major RampD investment like the one that ULA is doing for themselves with the ACES.

5342657,0,t1_cvukr7k,Raptor is in development but its not a Merlin replacment.  Raptor is supposed to be the engine that powers the BFR line.There was word a few months back that SpaceX was considering the possibility of building a smaller variant of Raptor for an advanced Falcon upper stage but currently no work is being done on this that we know of.  Its something that they might revisit down the road but for now it doesnt make sense.  The short term goal is to get Falcon  and Falcon Heavy flying in a reusable fashion for cheap access to space.  An expensive second stage that you cant recover or reuse goes against this model.   The Falcon design intentionally made certain compromises to keep as much of the cost in a recoverable first stage as possible.  A Raptor upper stage also means a Falcon launch with it is a mixed fuel rocket.  This increases complexity of launch operations further increasing the cost of one of these launches and going against the SpaceX goals.The only way it happens is if there is a significant demand for them to develop it and I dont think its likely for there to be enough volume of these launches to justify it.  ,ula,cvul0gh,9,t5_30yuo

5692171,0,t1_cx2mddg,I think this quote was taken a bit out of context. I believe he said that a combination of RD ban relief and funding for Vulcan would be necessary to keep ULA in business and therefore maintain assured access to space. The government really put ULA in a tough spot when it imposed the ban on the RD. Having a Vulcan ILC of  is great but for the next few years until Vulcan is ready ULA will be uncompetitive because Delta is so expensive and Atlas will have no engine for NSS launches Vulcan is absolutely necessary for the long term viability of ULA but saying that you will have a rocket ready in four years does nothing to fix the fact that ULA will not have a product to offer until then and therefore will be losing money and possibly would be sold off by Lockheed and Boeing for its lack of profitability. Then only SpaceX would be available for NSS launches and assured access would go down the toilet. To prevent that from happening the US government would be forced to sole source some Delta IV contacts to ULA which would end up being much more expensive to the taxpayer than either releasing the RD ban or providing some funding for vehicle development. Basically the US government wants ULA to stick around to maintain assured access but banned its only competitive product. The government screwed up it is their responsibility to help fix it. This is what they were saying when they asked for additional funding for Vulcan not that the future of the entire Vulcans project is in question. ,ula,cx2o3pq,11,t5_30yuo

6367771,0,t1_czcrgcj,Heres my reasoningConsidering that we have multiple rocket companies wanting to get to Mars it would make a lot of sense for one of those companies to create their own space station and rent it out primarily to universities who would have to agree to study human physiology in space and other relevant studies that benefit the Mars missions. Then allocated blocks where they are allowed to conduct their own research without restrictions.It would be mutually beneficial for the company who gains knowledge on how to increase survival chances of passengers and the university in exchange theyd be allowed other research to be conductedIts more likely that there will be combined investments from multiple establishments to set up such a station and that it wont be rented as all parties will have part ownership. But in terms of financial gain it would make sense for a company to set up multiple space stations. In a sense they will be fuelling their own fire creating their own market creating strong enough foundations to become THE company that we associate with reliable rockets. In  years if there isnt a privately owned space station then Ill be shocked. Maybe  if recent events are just hype but its a logical progression in the journey to Mars. ,ula,czdg21v,2,t5_30yuo

6711401,0,t1_d0dh3xx,The reason is that the AR does not develop the power as RD does. nFor example  using the same rocket the  with RD would develop more thrust than the same rocket with AR.To get the AR to provide the same performance the tanks would need to be stretched.However it could have the same tanks and an SRB attached to make it the same configuration as the . No MAJOR redesign of the rocket necessary. This provides a rocket that ULA could use if problems develop with the Vulcan. And as DeltIII shows problems with design of rockets are not always obvious at first.So if the Vulcan falters does ULA continue to fly the Atlas if it cannot get engines? Does it try to implement a replacement at a late date? Or does it fly the more expensive Delta and lose market share?You are simply assuming that the Vulcan with a new rocket and new engine will be developed in almost record time.

Anyway my point is that Vulcan alleged cost reduction compared to Atlas cant come from upper stage. Either it comes from some miracle on first stage unlikely or it is the whole set of behind the scene changes and negotiations with suppliers or it is pure PR nonsense.  Edit yes less SRBs help cheaper fuel might do  or two engines are always cheap on paper etc. However Vulcan is assumed to cost mil per commercial mission. It is cheaper than the cheapest Atlas ULA claims mil full cost mil including all subsidies and mil recently sold to NASA  subsidised.

7027179,0,t1_d1ctowr,The thing is we dont know why stage  shut down early and unless we know why it happened its hard to say how close it was to LOV. Maybe it shut down as youre assuming because burning for any longer was impossible due to propellant depletion or because the flight control software saw a reading it thought meant RUD unless it shut down. However its also possible that it saw something slightly off nominal at a point in the flight where shutting down wouldnt affect payload delivery and made the extra cautious choice and it would have been fine to burn those extra  seconds. Unfortunately unless you work at ULA the USAF or NASA I dont think either of us will ever get an answer.To say that it was extremely close is to make assumptions based on information for which we have no context.

9844432,0,t1_daqoq7v,Theyve been considering RL BEU from Blue Origin and an engine from XCOR for some years now.  My gut feeling is they go with BE.  RL is a known good system with decades of heritage.  But as many have pointed out its pretty expensive.  The feeling I get from reading news of Aerojet Rocketdyne for quite awhile now is that they dont seem eager to innovate or improve unless someone else fronts the majority of the bill.  Blue Origin is looking to use BEU in their orbital vehicle and Orbital ATK is planning to use it on an orbital rocket theyre considering. It lacks the heritage of RL but is likely much cheaper modern and the manufacturer has a vested selfinterest in improving it.  Blue Origin already has a relationship for delivering engines for Vulcan and by selling  per launch to ULA they can get more economies of scale.  Dont know much about XCORs entry.  I believe ULA has been working with them for awhile helping fund development.  In the end though it has the same downsides of the BE with none of the upsides.Itll probably be a couple of more years before we find out what they choose.,ula,daqr3p1,5,t5_30yuo
