1000941,0,t3_25k3t5,. Randys Fish Market is the most popular for good reason. A restaurant that is also a fish market. Delicious but moderately expensive depending on what you order.    . Tough one.. Buffalo chips in Bonita Springs has a small arcade fun atmosphere oldschool feel and the BEST bar none Buffalo Wings in SWFL.  . Someone mentioned Publix for subs. They are damn good. Another good deli is Tropic Chill. Not many Florida exclusive fast food joints.    . This will be a topic of great contention surely but Weekend Willies Sports Bar and Grill is a hidden gem and has absolutely excellent pizza. Its family friendly and has live entertainment nightly. Hint Tuesday is  price large pizza.    . Take a fishing charter. Take the Key West Express. Take a guided kayak tour. Get outdoors. If youre not an outdoorsy type there are art museums and other nonoutdoorsy things to do but IMO Florida is best experienced outside of the AC. It will be hot! Bring sunscreen and some of those spray bottles with fans on them. Put them in your cooler to keep them extra cold.    . Vanderbilt Beach but go to the left from the culdesac. All the partiers go to the right towards the Ritz Carlton. Vanderbilt is a great family beach outside of those parked in front of the hotel they are a fun group if your single. And there are a lot of them depending on the day. Clam Pass is my second favorite and Wiggins Pass State Park my third. If you are further south Lowdermilk and the Naples Pier are awesome.    . Fishing kayaking sunset cruise boat rentals jet ski rentals. Parasailing is expensive and anticlimactic IMO. Oh and shelling is really really fun if you do your research and head North to Sanibel Island and Captiva. If youre down here and have the time I highly recommend at least visiting Sanibel. One of the most beautiful places in SWFL.    . Miromar outlets in Estero is really the only outlet mall in the area. Tin City is fun local shopping. th avenue south and rd street north are more upscale shopping and dining. We also have the Coastland Mall Watermark super upscale and the Mercato.    .  Visit the Mercato website and familiarize yourself with them. They often do fun stuff for kids on weekends and they have a town square type area. Bayfront has a monthly even called rockin  on the bay. A quick google search will give you their schedule. If they have it going on I highly recommend. Its fun and great for kids.   Check out the Whats going on in SWFL Facebook page for   more options.     If you need more advice PM me Ill help you out. I know the area very well and will keep you out of the tourist traps and ripoff places.    Have fun!,Naples_FL,chi2cge,3,t5_2sbsg
1504696,0,t1_cj30oqc,That place is great! The airport and pine ridge industrial parks both have some that are good too. Mangos in the pine ridge industrial park.,Naples_FL,cj4vxs0,1,t5_2sbsg

4360237,0,t1_csgq4qz,The beach is your best option but be wary of the traffic and parking as that gets a little out of control,Naples_FL,csh4ru4,1,t5_2sbsg
5581859,0,t3_3rk7hs,Its tough to think of a non traffic related issue with season. I just want to know why they have to drive between am or pm its not like they work. Almost every morning there is someone going mph on Vanderbilt holding up traffic or going in reverse on Livingston because they missed a turn and cant be inconvenienced to make a u turn. I guess a non traffic related rant would be the sense of entitlement snowbirds seem to have. They seem to think that just because theyre old and retired to Florida they can do whatever they want and everyone should bend over backwards to accommodate them. ,Naples_FL,cwozcbz,12,t5_2sbsg

8532502,0,t1_d682h0e,Im actually only using the mighty pump once every month and havent had any issues.  Ive decided against the bleach only because I was concerned about the grass outside.  Havent had any issues.,Naples_FL,d684llk,1,t5_2sbsg
9434339,0,t1_d9b8kfl,Well they are quite loud so if theyre flying nearby when you are trying to sleep it cpuld definitely be annoying. And if they are flying right up to a window with a camera then that is a serious violation of privacy nobody would support someone looking into peoples windows.,Naples_FL,d9bv9fr,1,t5_2sbsg
9438121,0,t1_d9bv9fr,I see Ive not hear them yet. How do I know if they have a camera? I think they all have a camera right?,Naples_FL,d9ccjsc,1,t5_2sbsg
11600333,0,t3_65jr54,Right now is near high time for seasonal golf pricing. My go tos around naples right now would be about . Ill give you a few ideas that arent total garbage based on what I see on golf nowHibiscus for  would be okSpanish Wells hot deal for  is reasonableRiveria is a total dog track imo but you can get a practice round in for  if you time it right. Quail Run for  seems worth a shot I havent played it personally so I cant recommend heard its decent. Arrowhead for  seems reasonable towards the high end of quality to price ratio though. Eagle Lakes between  sounds solid if you can lock in the priceRaptor Bay has some afternoon deals for ...that would be my preference its a top notch tough course. Old Corkscrew has some twilight deals for  thats a really solid price but youll probably have to hustle. High Time LelyBonita SpringsOld CorkscrewTiburonTraveso will definitely be north of .Essentially if you want a steal youre gonna have to play twilight right now but you can get on some decent courses without going broke. Something else to consider which is more novely than anything is The Links of Naples night golf...its really well lit  holes and just kind of surreal. Im sure theres some better stuff out there but Id be happy to answer questions. ,Naples_FL,dgawnak,3,t5_2sbsg
