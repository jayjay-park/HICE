Im going to need to find a way to skip town fairly quickly if i dont want to get caught I think. What time of day is it right now ? What sorts of buildings do I see outside of the alleyway ?,MyWorldYourStory,dfqiseh,1,t5_3jtth

You stay CHASTE!Marianne ignores him and continues walking on as you catch up. Looking carefully you see her nails are trimmed short and her hands are calloused. She has a distinct tan you assume she worked in that small orchard with her father. Her long brown hair is in a single tight thick braid reaching down to the middle of her back. Shes wearing what would pass for a faded beige peasants dress but you catch a glimpse of a pant leg as she walks. The dress must be the nicest thing she had to wear to appeal to the Hansworths. You take note and approve of her very sensible travelling boots.,MyWorldYourStory,dgantmc,1,t5_3jtth
