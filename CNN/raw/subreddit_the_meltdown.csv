This is the same logic that Sanders supporters were using in the primaries when poll after poll showed Sanders losing to Clinton. The fact is the amount of yard signs that you see is an awful metric to judge how many people support a particular candidate. This is because certain candidates tend to attract more zealous supporters than others and these zealous supports tend to display just how zealous they are publicly here in the form of yard signs. But there is such thing as a silent majority and just as the silent majority carried Clinton to victory in the primaries they will most likely carry her to victory in this election.,the_meltdown,d993s62,0,t5_3gmsy

It also goes without saying that its an impractical one you can better regulate guns reduce their proliferation limit their sale and specifications sure but even many liberals want to keep their guns before you ever get to the sea of conservatives who would sooner die than give theirs up.

Just think about the metal bands that use devilish imagery for their albums but arent actually satanic. The way satanist describe thenselves they seem to be more in it cause its almost a counter culture to religion. I dont believe in god or the devil so Im honestly not scared of anyone associated with them unless they want to do harm to me.

9573223,0,t1_d9t0vtk,Obama was responsible to his investors and political cronies. The American people came second. Those investors and allies all rallied behind Hillary and snubbed their noses at Trump. With that off his back America comes first. The affordable care act has personally fucked me out of  dollars. Now Im under my employers private insurance plan and life is good again. I cant wait that this beurocratic behemoth held together with duck tape with rising rates in the double digits to be dismantled. It is not my job to subsidize the poor mine is to subsidize my family.Demonizing the Russians was another brilliant move on Barrys part. Making an enemy of one of the  world superpowers just to further his narrative. Mind blowing.  day as president elect and Trump has averted world war  and theyre queuing up to offer us trade deals.By cutting our corporate tax rates which are already some of the highest in the world business will come back and new business will bloom. These will offer manufacturinf jobs to the unemployed particularly the black community thus cutting unemployment l. You see the dems like to keep black communities poor so they are forced to suck on the govts tits so they will vote for them. Republicans have no vested interest in keeping them poor therefor policy changes will improve their lives to the point that US poverty rates improve.Unlike Barry and Hillary trump is not anti weed. This will lower prison populations black fathers will be able to support their children and again their wives and kids wont be on the govt dole because they wont be in prison.Obama also gave a voice to the domestic terrorist group black lives matter. Weve had like  race riots in the last year. What the fuck? You dont legitimize a destructive movement by inviting their leaders to back pats at the white house. Under trump will stop importing unemployable Muslims from the third world who refuse to integrate  like Obama does and hillary planned to do. Just look at europe to see what the outcome of that would have been With actual border security crime and drug trafficking rates will go way down. Also by actually funding border security jobs are created. Obama deported more illegals then any president in history but kept all the border holes in place for more to come inside.With a Republican house and Senate trump will also not have to rely on the unconstitutional use of signing laws into existence with  approval. Obama has signed hundreds.Trump plan to place term limits on congress and the Senate will lower govt corruption and keep those branches from being completely controlled by big business and lobbyists. This wasnt even on the dems radar. They dont wasnt wasnt to dismantle their cash cow.Every guy in the world weather gay or straight talks about the pussy or dick they get when around other guys. We say some rancid unPC shit to other guys. We all do it. Every one of us. Every guy that was outraged about those remarks wasnt actually outraged about those remarks.Also under Obama the NSA has ran rampant collecting data on law abiding Americans. He promised the most transparent DOJ in history but instead we we got the most secretive. Only thanks to wikileaks did the American public learn about an iota of the shit his administration has been pulling the strings behind.Lastly the stock market has already rebounded since the threat of a hillary presidency last night and the SampP is at a record high.In  day we have peace with russia no globalist leeches sucked into the veins of America and the markets are up.

The timing of it dovetailed very nicely with all the bullshit outrage over nothing that the Left has been hemorrhaging since the th of November and the unhinged antics of the protesters I would not be surprised at all to find out it was.

I especially didnt realize just how unilaterally Truman acted when the decision was made.I really wish it wasnt the case but Ive seen a whole lot of arguments I would call them debates or discussions but that implies an actual exchange of ideas where one side actually tries to communicate and the other side just goes the intellectual cowardice route and parrots two lines of gotcha bullshit and pretends thats enough to satisfy an argument. Rather than admitting that maybe their opponent has a point they try to distance themselves from their own argument and pretend theyre above listening to differing opinions.,the_meltdown,ddnrdyh,2,t5_3gmsy
