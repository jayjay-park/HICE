2275835,0,t3_2l0dt1,I have to say Im not a fan of this Success Chance mechanic. I find a lot of the fun in this game is trying to optimize your choices to build things in a certain priority. With the items that can fail you wait and work to build up the materials and then... the chance of zero payoff and throwing off your priority and build order. Thats antifun to me. Id rather some of these late game items to have wider and greater resource costs to make it harder rather that some arbitrary failure die roll.With that said I love the game and I love all the hard work and additions you make to it.
