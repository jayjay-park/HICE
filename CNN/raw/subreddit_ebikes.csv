I did get permission to share the details I was given so long as you understand the that quote those are not final datas but best of my knowledge at this point in development. I was also asked not to supply this individuals direct contact info as this person is slammed enough as it is keeping up with inquiries but I can tell you the source is reliable and is identified on the about us page on their website.OK. Disclaimer aside this is what I was toldwe are still in final validation process in terms of cells and other parts. .....We are building the product with a Wmph assistance High Torque motor more or less Nm  configured by software at Wkmh assistance for EU but able to be opened if legislation is changing or allowing top speed opened is about kmh or mph.The battery Ah should be around .Ah or total of Wh.Range will vary from  to  miles depending on load elevation assistance level chosen terrainroad or off road... not counting the possibility to regen some  back in in general the average is about  for a full charge.Long terms reliability... we are using a proven motor technology not from China and finalizing battery cells validation with Panasonic Samsung and Boston Power just great people  BMS PCBA all issued from the initial MIT project and our current talented and highly qualified development Team.We are using V for performance and global efficiencyHope this helps.,ebikes,cesrsr9,2,t5_2si7q

1501247,0,t3_2b7ayo,. You need bikes with mm spacing if you choose rear hub drive. Older bikes with   or  in the back will need frame work to stretch the rear triangle to mm spacing. Mountain bikes are a popular choice because of the factory provided mm spacing... and  robust frame for high speeds builds. Mountain frames also come with provisions for disc brake but I have found that some of the smaller discs dont have any more stopping power than Vbrake rim brakes.. Hard to say which is both cost effective and durable without specifying terrain. If you ride on flat terrain then a single speed hub drive like a Mac brand hub would likely offer excellent value with its wide stator.  But with hills involved cheap and durable requires a  speed hub there is one made by Xiongda. Their hubs are also inexpensive. As for batteries check electricbike.com for suppliers of the most recent battery technology like NiCoMn Lithium. Dont bother with outdated lithium technologies. They have a lower energy density and will make the bike heavier.. Question  and  are the same except that you asked about bike size in question . By bike size i will assume you mean wheel size because frame size matters not to motor choice. Wheel size doesnt matter much when choosing which brand but within any brand you can select a motor winding for either small wheels which spin fast and need less torque or larger wheels which need more torque and less speed. Fast wound motors use more turns of thinner wire and torque motors use fewer turns of fatter wire. So  as an example within Mac brand motors you will select either T for a  wire turn high speedlow torque motor suitable for  wheels or T or  wire turns for a low speed high torque motor suitable for  and c wheels given a  volt system the most common choice. V gets faster and more expensive and which motor  and controller you choose might also have to be considered more carefully depending on how large your wheels are.,ebikes,cj4ge7k,1,t5_2si7q

5505092,0,t3_3qhpqi,Yes youre correct. The controller is pulling from the battery so as long as the battery is the right voltage and is capable of providing what the controller needs youre in good shape. Having a battery that can handle more amps than the controller draws is a good thing since it doesnt stress the battery as much.For reference Volts x Amps  Watts. Therefore Watts  Volts  Amps.W  V  Amps.Now thats helpful and it gets us in the ballpark but at the same time its a bit misleading because vendors almost always list their motors by their continuous output rather than their peak output which can be significantly higher. For example my personal bike runs a rear v w hub motor kit which can pull well upwards of w when accelerating then settles in to ww when cruising at MPH. Sure enough when I look at the motor controller that came with my w kit it shows a max current of  Amps which at v comes out to w.You want a battery that can handle the highest current your motor will try to draw not just the continuous current. For the battery youre looking at the .Ah option can handle up to A but the .Ah and .Ah options can handle A. To be safe I would go with one of those two.,ebikes,cwfbs34,5,t5_2si7q

Other parts of the world theyre still somewhat novelty even here in the US. Hence Im constantly amp specifically making my comparisons in between hub motors. As Im completely against comparing two different systems.The reason Im saying that is comparing hub motors and mid drive motors is like comparing an injection engine and a turbo engine in my opinion.

More power more faster.So for the same torque and heating the smaller wheel will actually be spinning faster at every speed so it is making more power.The state of Chinese motor design and the market full of cheap Chinese hub motors kinda means we need to down size to fit the motor diameter.These motors are basically designed for small diameter wheels and we are using them in large diameter wheels.,ebikes,da1j2lw,3,t5_2si7q
9687305,0,t1_da75mas,gt The tire part I was thinking of it in the sense that since I wont be going full speed on streets I would obviously slow down and make a turn  not yank the bar and try to drift every corner. So I was wondering why it would be that drastic of a requirement to even change tires. Besides this I can still change tires if its midengine drive since itll be simple but will cause headache if its hubmotor.You will have serious issues even at speeds below  kph. I can tell that from experience. By now the profile of my tires has worn down quite a bit and they feel much safer but with offroad tires on the road at higher speeds you will have serious problems. Its a requirement in the sense that youll likely just die in the first turn with the wrong tires because you lose all grip instantly.gt As for the disguising factor  I understand where youre coming from but it seems like youre describing it in the scenario that if I were to just use the frame I showed and do nothing to itNo. Even low throttle acceleation will look SUPER unnatural no matter what the frame looks like. Again the Frame wont matter the pure acceleration will look extremly suspicious. As for your other plan Any cop will say you drove more then the legal  mph with that thing its now confiscated until legallity can be established. Quite an expensive hobby that would make it. There s no going around it The acceleration and speed alone are suspicious and gt By the time Im done with it people will be wondering what the fuck it even is.Will make cops even more likely to stop you to find out exactly that. Im sorry but its dillusional to think you can just disguise a high performance electric bike. Its super obvious from miles away by just looking at how it accelerates no matter the amount of tape around the shocks.gt Also Im surprised they wont let you legalize a highperformance eBike in Germany yet they have the Auobahn where people can rape the living fuck out of their supercars and not suffer any legal repercussion.German cars have a huge lobby see VW Diesel Scandal everything else is illegal here until proven otherwise. ,ebikes,da75z14,1,t5_2si7q

Tesla is focusing on making batteries that have high capacity over high output.The cells in a Model S are working under much less load individually compared to your ebike so theyre designed with energy density as a primary concern over high discharge capability. Similarly the C rating of the Powerwall  would basically be C probably running somewhat below actual max to increase lifespan though. Based on what we know of their product so far and what theyre optimizing it for on mid and high powered ebikes they wouldnt be the best choice.Theres no reason you couldnt if you wanted to.. I guess you could build a mondo pack to overcome low discharge capabilities..

10959597,0,t1_de9nxw9,...So after the first  mile commute at W continuous almost mph  wow. What a difference the tires make.However I have a much larger turning radius than before with these tires so while I could easily do sharp corners at very high speed before with the new tires they dont seem to like doing that. It is still unreal how quiet the bike is. Before I never heard the motor BBSHD because of the tires. Now I hear it.,ebikes,deael1q,1,t5_2si7q

11200539,0,t1_df1iyac,Wrong. Ah is a measure of exactly that Amp hours. This is not energy nor energy density.Watt hours describes stored energy and Whm  describes energy density.OP you need  km range and  kph speed? You need at least  kWh of energy. Thats about  USD  worth of battery. Very few consumer ebikes have this much energy storage. DIY is the way to go.,ebikes,df1kfgx,1,t5_2si7q

11275026,0,t1_df9jrbn,Many battery failures probably can relate to a BMS failure. And when batteries fail they sometimes catch fire.  BMSes are supposed to protect the batteries but they are perfectly capable of destroying a battery if they malfunction.Some possible scenarios The typical BMS balancer works by discharging batteries through a resister during charging.  So if one cell is high then itll run it against its resister and dump the excess charge off as heat. A resister may blow out causing the balancing function not to work anymore. One cell could get very hot charge damaging it. Impurities form in the cells chemistry. These impurities cause that cell to short out internally and the rest of the battery pack is shorted out through that cell causing it to heat up and catch on fire. Or.. The BMS circuitry itself could crap out during charging one night and leave one resister on the entire time draining one cell almost completely while the charger charges the rest to the full rating of the pack.So if you have a s pack and you charge to  volts  cells  . volts each and  cell is stuck at .v then the rest of the cells actually get charged to something like .v.  This could certainly start a fire. Especially if this is allowed to happen repeatedly. Or...Maybe there was a failure in the manufacturing process excess solder on connections or little bits of metal bouncing around in the battery case near the BMS and the BMS itself shorted the batteries out itself through their balancing wires.  The BMS itself turns into a heater catches on fire which catches the cells close to it on fire... which then causes the entire pack to go up in smoke. Probably lots of other fun ways they can go very wrong. ,ebikes,dfa0ajl,5,t5_2si7q

11365005,0,t1_dfk20jj,FYI LunaCycle sells a press fit an addapter for the BBSHD.I totally agree about the HYDROLIC disk brakes. My second BBSHD bike is a  Fuji  hard tail I found on Craigslist for  that needed a good cleaning new tires and tune upbut came with hydrolic disks. Deals are to be had if you look close and pay attention to the functional features. I liked the hydrolic disks so much that I also bough hydrolic ebrakes only about  for shimanos to install on my Giant BBSHD hard tail that had cable disk brakesvery easy upgrade if you already have disks on your bike. It was also about the best upgrade Ive made other than the BBSHD. Also note hydrolic brakes take a lot less maintenance and continued finetuning than cable disks.,ebikes,dfk79t5,1,t5_2si7q

The suspension fork makes it sooo much nicer to ride.  I dont know how people ride rigid bikes.  IRL you have to go off curbs and deal with all sorts of shitty roads.  Forget about a slightly bumpy trail.  But now I can go anywhere with it.  ,ebikes,dfrfxf1,1,t5_2si7q

In situations load conditions where copper losses are lower than core loses then you have too much motor too much core loss. This happens when your load is overly low for your speed.But not having enough motor also means you suffer huge copper losses.,ebikes,dfs2rbi,1,t5_2si7q
