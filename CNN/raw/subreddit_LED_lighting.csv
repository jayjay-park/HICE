If lucky you can find ones with just the right internal resistance to drive the LED without additional means of current limiting driver resistor.,LED_lighting,d0wp09c,1,t5_2xgbn

All of the products are available from Amazon for half the price theyll actually arrive if you order from Amazon and Amazon will stand behind their products. Cant say the same about Lampeez.,LED_lighting,dbh34o1,1,t5_2xgbn
