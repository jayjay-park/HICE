2727,0,t3_1u3x7q,Research and treatment for various illnesses including pediatric cancer!  If I was capable of having kids again I would donate cord blood for sure.  My only biological kiddo died of cancer before her first birthday and although a stem cell donation from cord blood wouldnt necessarily have been a treatment option for her disease we knew kids who received stem cells that way for therapeutic reasons.  I wish we had banked or donated  though I think the banks are ripping parents off and I hope society gets to the point where we all donate enough cord blood to help the people who need it.,Mommit,ceeqyhz,2,t5_2s3i3

Not doing so would have left me engorged and miserable. he also REFUSED to drink from the bottle for the  hour ordeal of waiting for surgery. So right after I woke up I fed him. He was fine not any more sleepier than usual. I am not saying you should do this but ask about it. If you are on morphine for the pain little gets into the breast milk. I feel for you though!

131142,0,t3_1vkpjh,gt I guess I just feel they have somewhat of a right to say hello and goodbye because without these men my husband and I would not exist.No one has a right to someone elses children unless there are some very out of the norm circumstances like the parents being abusive and the kids being taken away from them etc.My father is abusive.  When I cut contact with him because I couldnt take it anymore he literally stalked me.  This ass didnt even raise me.  I got to know him as an adult and he abused me and stalked me.  I managed to hide from him for  years and he found my new address... he is stalking me again.  This man thinks he has a right to my child because they are biologically related.  I am doing everything I can including trying to get a restraining order to keep this idiot away from my family.  He has no right to my child.My mother is abusive as well.  She tends to be very sexually inappropriate not to the extent of molesting but still it is very disturbing and thinks that peanut allergies are things that hypochondriacs make up to get attention.  Well my son has a peanut allergy and I dont feel like allowing her to shame my son if he doesnt enjoy seeing her do housework naked or doesnt want to play in the yard naked etc.  She will never meet my son if I can help it.  I think there is enough bad stuff in the world without volunteering to expose my son to the scary abusive people in my family.  I dont want him to think that being abusive is normal because his grandparents are like that.  And most of all I dont want these people to get their hooks in him and abuse him the way they abused me or worse.  No freakin way.  If my parents died tomorrow I would be nothing but relieved because then Id know the abuse would finally be over.  The stalking would be over.  The attempted guilt trips would be over.  I definitely wouldnt be sad that they didnt meet my son.  They dont deserve the privilege.,Mommit,cetd6ph,4,t5_2s3i3

He will go to bed between  and thats all I got sista. He likes to party at  or am but a boob usually gets him back down. Have you tried everything to get yours to go back to sleep for an hour or so? And naps? Fuck naps. They have singlehandedly been the most frustrating thing about having a baby because I read ALL the books and let me tell you how full of bullshit pie they are. There are SO many things going on inside that little person... Brain is going nuts learning every single second of every moment body growing at a ridiculous rate teeth all of it it all causes them to have weird sleep night and day. I think so long as you are just mindful of when sleepy cues happen and just present a comfortable sleepy environment that baby is gonna sleep when it wants to and not when it doesnt. I rack my brain every day trying to get on a schedule because so and sos baby was on a schedule at  months and it was perfect and they slept from  and took  hour naps. Bull.shit.pie.in.the.sky.I figure no matter what you do whatever schedule you actually manage to form its going to go haywire from teething regressions milestones Wonder weeks etc so I just try and work on going with the flow.

268971,0,t1_cf8lkbj,Also worked in childcare with four kids of my own.  You are not crazy it hurts and you are entitled to be upset!  There are a couple of things to ease your mind . Yes kids do associate any woman who cares for them as being the mom it is pretty normal.  We used to tell parents to shake it off while your kiddo is in the room you dont want them to begin to feel that the other caregiver isnt someone they should trust go to your car and be sad because it is and know that your child says this because they have another person in their life who loves them almost as much as you do!.  Take into consideration verbal development.  Children say repetitive two syllable words because they are easy to say.  All of my kids call their grandfathers Papa because it was easier to say that Grandpa.  My son randomly started calling my mom Mama and she kept telling him yes we will go get mommy.  She finally realized he was calling her mama and I was mommy.  He may have another phrase that he is using for you that you havent picked up on yet..  Farther down you mention that your kiddo doesnt want you when he is sick or needs help.  It also seems like your life recently has been pretty stressful.  Kids know that something is going on if you have been stressed he may be turning to someone who isnt stressed out for comfort.  Take some time to relax whatever that may be.  A lot of what is going on here is normal development is really a good thing and will ease as you get settled into your new home.Oh as far as your MIL calling him your husbands name I call my son by my brothers name nearly every other day.

859583,0,t1_ch1v7vv,I appreciate the discussion! Chemicals have gotten a bad rep and a lot of people lump them all together as dangerous even though theyre the building blocks of our entire earth. I try to specify harmful chemicals when talking about the subject. And I use the term natural for lack of a better term.. any suggestions for an alternative that still gets the main point across? To be more concise with my question... we know that certain products we use everyday are toxic to the human body. If I can eat olive oil then I can assume that putting it on my skin and letting it absorb will be okay. However if I decide to use a commercial face wash I am told to contact poison control if its ingested. With that understanding it seems reasonable to go for the more natural alternative. But why do people still buy the toxic version? Its true that shunning chemicals is a result of a widespread misunderstanding and the term natural isnt much better. Maybe the word sustainable would be better suited? Either way I hear where youre coming from and much more research will need to be conducted before any conclusions can be drawn about the harmfulness of certain synthetic chemicals and GMO food. Its hard to be a wise consumer of research when so many competing interests influence what is known. Either way I try to stick to a philosophy of the simpler the better. Less steps to get my food from a to b less steps for my products to be created less ingredients period  less concern.

My friends split into two categories the ones who were willing to put up with it and the ones who werent.  Eventually both numbers changed.  A few people ran for the hills and never spoke to me again... and I see that as THEIR issue.  They were so freaked out by the idea of having a kid that even other people having kids scared them away.  But after a few years to adjust most of my friends started to come around again.  Most of them either have kids or want them now so they enjoy time with me and my daughter.  My guess is that your best friend and others need time to adjust to the idea... and babies are not fun to be around.  Older kids are much easier.  So I have three suggestions for you . Make a point to hang out with out the baby around.  .  Make sure babies are not all you talk about.  Even if it is a stretch to come up with something else show your friends you are not a total bore to be around.  As a mom I can not hang out with other moms because parenting is all that we discuss since it tends to be the only thing we have in common.  DONT BE THAT PERSON In fact dont talk about your kid unless asked to and even then dont ramble on and on.  .  Get some new hobby friends.  When my husband and I moved away from our home town we joined a sword fighting school.  This place is AWESOME.  Since we came in as parents no one saw us as anything but cool people who happen to have a kid.  We got to make friends with people we shared interest in and having a kid in tow does not seem weird to this group since they only know us as parents.  Honestly other than a few like  select old friends they have become some of the most important people in our lives!  Keep in touch but dont cling to old relationships.  Either they will come around or you will move on.  Just remember you changed the dynamic and it is unfair for you to expect your friends to be on board with a major life change that affects how you guys can hang out.  Also this is important to note.  Your nonbaby friends are going to see this come up more and more in their lives... eventually they will pretty much HAVE to get used to the idea.  One friend of mine does not care too much for kids... she is an academic who never wants them but most of her friends have them so she had to adjust to the idea of being around kids or being mostly alone as a  something with no kids.  ,Mommit,ch706ar,1,t5_2s3i3

You are your sons advocate. As for delays he is a little behind normal but that could be his normal. My daughter who had no birth defects or anything didnt walk until  months. My son who is also normal is not talking hes  months now.  Dont compare your son to the children of your friends. Every child is different and has their own normal.

1193654,0,t3_27s85t,Everyones different!  I was back in my prepregnancy clothes  days postpartum.  Now Im pregnant with my second.  Im guessing Ill never lose the weight with this one.  Just kidding...Ive only gained  pounds and Im  months along.  Honestly though get to your doctor and have them check your cholesterol and blood pressure.  Make sure there arent any medical issues that are helping you hold the weight.  Hormonal imbalances.  Also RELAX.  Stress makes it difficult to lose weight.  Ignore the scale!  Sounds like youre obsessed with the numbers.  How do you feel?  Depression and lethargy can really take a toll on metabolism and affect the energy youre expending.  Are you enjoying the exercise?

1264253,0,t3_28kgql,You just need to be polite but firm.  Your baby your rules.  Honestly I wouldnt personally worry much about handwashing before touching a baby whos not immunocompromised but its also not an unreasonable request.I also needed fenugreek to get my supply to an adequate level and that obviously has nothing to do with your sons weight its really hard to overfeed a baby whos nursing exclusively because they usually wont nurse more than their brain tells them they need but she has a valid concern about his weight.  At  lbs hes in the th percentile even for a ten month old so if I were you Id talk to the pediatrician about it and see if hes concerned.  My child didnt hit  lbs until she was around  months so if my second was that large Id definitely be questioning if it was healthy.  Some amount of pudge is absolutely desirable at that age but it can also be a serious health problem if his height is not commensurate and it doesnt start melting off as he gets older and more active.  Depending on how she phrased things I wouldnt necessarily consider it an indictment of my parenting... shes probably just much more comfortable addressing sensitive issues with her son.  And while callingtexting  times a week is probably on the high side of normal thats also about how frequently I talk to my own mother.  As long as it doesnt bother your husband I think shes fine there too.Regarding how your son will react to them... you know his temperament better than anybody but most babies would warm up pretty quickly over the course of a visit.  Honestly your own feelings and behavior are going to play a huge role in how your son reacts.  If youre tense about it hes going to pick up on it and be tense too.  If you manage to relax things will probably go a whole lot more smoothly because hell see that mommy isnt treating these people like strangers.Best of luck!,Mommit,cibuerk,3,t5_2s3i3
1269164,0,t3_28mo5y,Im an adoptive mummy. I honestly hate it when people say hes lucky to have us as parents. They have no comprehension of how lucky WE are to have him.  Yes he didnt have the greatest start in life but we didnt ride in on a white horse to rescue him in some nobel quest out of a disney movie.The fact is we adopted because we cant have our own children so unfortunately our reasons are a little more selfish than people like to make out. I consider myself unbelievably lucky to have been matched with the most beautiful  perfect baby boy who enjoys my constant singing and laughs at my silly faces. He brings so much joy to everyone he meets and I cannot get over how lucky I am to get to call myself his mom! I feel forever indebted to my social worker for finding him for us. Im thankful to his birth mom for many reasons but mainly for being so gracious during the legal proceedings and not contesting further which meant we could bring him home quicker and have him home at  months old reducing the risks of attachment issues as he grows up. Saying he is lucky will only make him feel as though he should be grateful to us this is not the case at all! He does not owe us anything him allowing us to be his parents is more than we couldve asked for and  him calling me mama is the most amazing thing in the world. ,Mommit,cicebk2,10,t5_2s3i3

1324420,0,t3_29926v,I guess I do. I have this one I like it because it doesnt look too babyish has the insulated pouch for keeping drinks cool or warm has an external pouch with a wipes holder so you dont need to go digging for wipes has a nice spot for diapers that doesnt involve digging around and is great for flying!I actually bought it before going on a plane trip and it has a clear zipper pouch that comes out so I can put liquids and gels in it great for going through security and it fits my laptop AND an iPad with a babyproof case it in along with a change of clothes for baby snacks a blanket some toys diapers wipes and all sorts of creams and stuff for mommy too. It LOOKS small but fits a lot and has a nonvelcro pouch on the outside that is good for things like boarding passes and birth certificates since you can just slip it out with one hand. The strap can be made long enough so that you can carry with without hands great for running through the airport holding a wiggly toddler but I made it short enough to kind of keep it sitting on top of the suitcase when needed.What else... it seems durable and was easy to clean food the baby rubbed on it. It fits perfectly under the seat for takeoff and landing. Its super light when not filled with an entire Apple store worth of electronics AND is easy to open and close with one hand. SO MANY POCKETS EVERYWHERE. I was able to put a standard bottle of water AND a baby bottle in the insulated pouch so we could both drink.I could probably go on and on but this bag has been great so far!,Mommit,ciim4fp,1,t5_2s3i3

Fully blown freak out and crying until I got it off his hands. Since then he wont eat it the same for Mac and cheese mashed potatoes any type of meat and many more that I cant think of right now. It seems like if its not hard and stiff then he doesnt like it. He loves pretzels crackers cereal almost any type of fruits and veggies that are raw etc. Its just hard to get fruits and veggies that are raw that he can eat.

2189254,0,t3_2k3z89,Just step out.  Its great gentle training if theyre behaving badly and helps break the association that develops in older children between whiningtantrums and getting what they want.Generally a toddler only gets difficult for a reason those with special needs perhaps excepted and it tends to be.  Tiredness.  HungerSo try these first.  As you probably know even if theyre hungry if theyve already become grouchy they often refuse to eat. The same with sleep.  Theyre exhausted yet they fight and fight nap time. But feel free to step outside have a break for a few minutes. It wont hurt them. They wont even remember.And as a single stayathome parent dont feel guilty about an iPad babysitter if it helps.   minutes or so here and there throughout the day isnt going to stunt your childs development.  In fact it may even help depending what you choose for them to watch.  I recommend music and nursery rhymes on YouTube as kids learn to memorise them which is great.,Mommit,cli3vzt,3,t5_2s3i3

2213922,0,t3_2kel99,I am the mother of a th grade weird kid and I remember all too well the days in Kindergarten when my daughter would come home crying that she was being teased and didnt have any friends. I talked to her teacher about it and she seemed surprised because my daughter had quite a few friends. The issue was more that my kid wanted to be friends with girls who didnt care for her and wasnt picking up on the social cues they were giving offand honestly they were really mean. We spent a lot of time talking about what kids were nice to her and how to cultivate friendships with them as well as how to distance herself from kids who werent so nice.We also talked a lot about personal responsibility. My daughter learned that she had to go to the bathroom to pick her nose if she didnt want other kids to call her gross.  She learned that brushing her hair in the morning is the best way to prevent kids from making fun or her appearance. It sounds like your son needs to learn that lesson about his clothes. He can wear whatever he wants but that means hed rather wear that than keep from being teased. We went to see a child psychologist who taught her strategies for dealing with other people and me how to reinforce that behavior. My daughter now has a great group of friends the social skills to know to only talk minecraft with other people who are into it and the self confidence to realize that being the weird kid can be pretty awesome. We all call each other weird at home and she proudly says were a weird family.You can bug the school until they intervene but its not going to make your son any friends or teach him any social skills. Social skills dont come naturally to autistic people but that doesnt mean theyre incapable of learning. ,Mommit,cll8r0r,9,t5_2s3i3

Labor and delivery was mostly exhausting with a few minutes of pain and a few days of soreness.  I wanted to be able to get in other positions walk around and negate even small chances of side effects.  The benefit of a home delivery with midwives was that an epidural was not an option unless I transferred.  It really kept me focused.  Had I been in the hospital I may have chosen one just for some sleep.  Went into labor Monday and delivered Thursday.  Slept maybe  total hours.  Being exhausted helped with the pain though.

I lost all baby weight from all of my pregnancies with healthy eating  meals a day  no dieting simply by breastfeeding and then chasing after a toddler.

Cucumber slices cherry tomatoes cheese cubes raspberries all in a circular pattern.  He doesnt have to eat it. Have him serve it to you and go into raptures about how tasty it is.Let him pick let him watch let him play with food.

3203295,0,t1_cotyrwc,Thanks for replying!. We are talking about it a lot more now and she is making more of an effort. At first her behavior wasnt too bad and so she ignored it or allowed it but as its getting worse she can see that guidelines need to be set now its just a matter of deciding what those should be.... I am having a problem with setting a routine and youre probably right about that being an issue. Before when I worked I was always up early before she woke up and had time to myself before she got out of bed to make breakfastbrowse the internet for a minute or two etc. During this time her behavior was definitely much better. Now I usually get up at the same time she does. Shes even gotten up before me more times than I am willing to admit especially lately. I feel awful when that happens and usually its because my alarm didnt go off or something but sometimes Im awake but struggling to find the energy to get out of bed knowing the battles that lie ahead. I think its also probably because girlfriend and I havent been great about getting to bed on time because we use the time when shes asleep to finally get our own work done and often end up staying up way too late. I know thats not an excuse. Before I became her roomatecaregiver she was AFAIK kept up at really odd hours staying up till am and sleeping in till past noon. Now her bedtime is at  its late because daddy doesnt get home till  from work and she usually is up by  depending on how successful bedtime is.. Yikes. She has definitely slapped me in the face before and she kicked girlfriend in the nose once so hard it made it bleed that time was an accident fortunately. I have a few times left her room and shut the door to give her and myself time to kind of calm down when shes screaming or pitching a fit about changing her diaper or getting dressed its only been recently that shes fought about that stuff. Its always only for like a minute or two and I do talk to her through the door and ask her to calm down so we can try again which she usually does. I guess thats basically a time out?Did I mention nap time yet? Oh lord. Its like a catch if I dont make her nap shell be absolutely unmanageable by dinner time. If I do try to make her nap sometimes she will refuse to sleep and the effort in doing so will induce unmanageable behavior for the rest of the day. But when she DOES nap she is much more pleasant to be around and generally has an easier time going to bed later.Thank you for the advice and encouragement. It really means a lot to me right now.,Mommit,cou0rmv,3,t5_2s3i3

3532571,0,t3_30qfyp,Almost all kids are fine after vaccinations. If you daughter hasnt had adverse reactions to any other vaccinations shell likely be the same with this one. The only reason you should be concerned is if you have a family history of bad reactions to vaccines and even then it may not affect her.My mother had bad reactions febrile seizures so my vaccines where done in  doses. I was fine. My first child who has autoimmune issues and is on the autism spectrum as well as other neurological disorders had bad reactions to his th DTAP though fine with the first  and his first and only MMR which because of the other issues was delayed until he was  as we were expecting a reaction and he had to go straight to ER with swollen face and trouble breathing. Hes totally fine now at . My daughter never had any issues beyond swelling at the injection site for any of her vaccines including both doses of the MMR although we did skip Prevnar pneumonia vaccine I think? because she is allergic to something used in the manufacture of that one.It doesnt sound like you have any family history or reason to worry beyond your OCD so please let this reassure you rather than further freak you out. Have you been seeing you therapist? Also remember how bad measles is and how much worse getting that disease will be for her than getting a shot. Telling yourself that her likelihood of catching the disease may be higher than the likelihood that she will have an adverse reaction to the vaccination may help as well.,Mommit,cpuxqwi,0,t5_2s3i3

3751061,0,t1_cqjtr27,This is what weve done as well and it has seemed to work so far we are down to only having accidents when mom and dad forget to bring her into the potty every couple hours. My daughter is  mos and we started sitting her on the potty casually around  mos. Weve been really relaxed and not pushy at all.  We tried the  day thing where you start off wearing nothing and my daughter thought it was cool to watch herself pee on the floor. Not cool to mommy and daddy! And I second the pull ups being used as a diaper. She definitely knows when shes wearing them and can wet whenever she wants and when shes wearing big girl panties and will get herself all wet. I believe our journey would have been a lot faster if our daycare would have let us send her in training panties instead of pull ups. ,Mommit,cqjuhza,2,t5_2s3i3

3815637,0,t3_33wa7n,I went through stages of this with both my kids and going through one right now with my youngest. She is currently crying at the drop of a hat refusing to do anything for herself lying as of breathing and refusing to do as she is told. Ever. If I say black she says white whilst running off giggling. When I confront her about it she says no... I said black! or I dont remember! Its takes a few days each time we hit an episode but consistency is the only thing that works. There are consequences for actions as my children well know. As long as I keep to those consequences and follow through when I make a threat it only takes a few days now. It took weeks with my eldest the first time and the talking to himself at bedtime and keeping himself up was the worst. I can tell you the only consequence that is consistent between both my children is what happens when they get stubborn about supper. if they have never eaten whatever they will try three proper bites. If they do not that is the only thing that goes on their plate until they have three proper bites. Same goes for food they request or something I know they will eat. I do not force them to overeat however I do not put up with this nonsense of I dont like this today either. Every meal that item until they finish. Generally they are having something else by supper the next day. With my elder child taking things away distresses him at the moment of the event but it produces no lasting... Fear of consequence beyond the initial item. He will work to avoid losing that first thing whatever it is. But once hes got one item in time out its like he doesnt much care beyond that. Same goes if I have to throw things out. Clothes or toys. The kids dont watch that much TV so taking that away is meh. I use video games as a reward for exceptional behaviour so he might play for an hour once a week if that much. There are a few situation specific things that seem to work. He stopped tipping his chair or sitting in it improperly at all when he had to stand at the table because we took his chair away for a day. He stopped leaping on the sofa when I wouldnt let him use the sitting room furniture at all for a week. He recently developed a very attitude laden alright in response to instruction. He was grounded from his favourite activities one by one in greater and greater length until we stopped hearing that. That took two months. He was given housework to do every time he came to me and said Im bored. as well. Useless housework at that. Things like emptying all the sock drawers unpairing them mixing them up and then sorting it all out properly again. I dont know if your lad can manage something like that without assistance but you can explain to him that his freedom around the home is a privilege and if he is not going to respect the home he will lose the privilege of freedom. baby gate in the door to his room maybe? you can give him some useless repetitive task when he has a tantrum and explain that when he is done with that he can have whatever. Play time lunch whatever. Not a bribe whatever he would normally be doing otherwise. bedtime... Yea youre just going to have to tough that one out. I still sometimes have issues with bedtime and I see no end in sight. Save your sanity. Put him to bed close the door and get on with your evening. If you have to remove toys from near and in his bed. Spot check him once in a while but not every night but for the most part dont sweat it. Make sure you get him up early in the morning though. And let him know daily when he grumbles its the consequence of not going to sleep when its time. Never too early for that lifelong lesson imho. ,Mommit,cqr7oyr,1,t5_2s3i3

They send a box monthly with various things such as toys for baby hand creams for mom organic cloth security blankets spoons etc. and each item is pretty unique. They have gift subscriptions and if she continues it after baby is here the box of goodies grows appropriately with the babies age  And as many others have mentioned spas can be nice. Personally i had a pregnancy massage when I was  months along and it was kind of uncomfortable for me but she might enjoy it who knows  Since she still has a ways to go maybe you can slowly help her put together her go bag ... Things she wants to take to the hospital with her unless she is having an at home birth then disregard someone got me a nice diaper bag and filled it with extra tooth brushes and tooth paste travel sized shampoo and conditioner some nice stretchy new leggings I could wear comfortably on my way home and then when I picked out my daughters outfit to bring her home in I packed that in there as well  just food for thought. Diapers diapers diapers! NOT NEWBORN size lol. Before my little one came we had stocked up on  diapers in various sizes and we didnt need to buy more for a while which was nice. Also places like Walmart will exchange unopened boxes for other diaper sizes even without a receipt  doesnt matter if it was purchased there as long as the bar code works  Edit fixed typo.TLDR citrus lane gift subscription spa maybe help with hospital go bag diapers.,Mommit,cwdpeud,2,t5_2s3i3

I didnt know it at the time just knew they were trying to pottytrain again didnt work out the first time. I encouraged him to go before bed he sat on there for EVER probably a good hour and peed and pooped in the toilet. Went to bed. Parents came home I reported they were shocked in a good way. I guess doing it with me was much less pressure because I dont live there so if he fails it wont haunt him and I dont really expect anything of him as Im not his mother.Not sure if thatll work for your daughter OP but perhaps?I was a difficult child to pottytrain because I just didnt want to stop what I was doing. My mom tried lots of things many of which I wont do with my kids because it can come across as shaming and it feels terrible to not live up to expectations failing again and again. She tried ugly clothes shaming sleeping in the bathtub since its right by the toilet but it backfired because its so hard to get comfy in there that even if you have to go you wont get up making me change my bedding this ones fine no sleepovers also fine etc.,Mommit,d07wubm,3,t5_2s3i3

Its very simple narratively with an odd style of illustration. It focuses how the baby collectively belongs to the family and how they all can be included caring for and helping it. In one scene the text is something like a baby to feed and shows the mom nursing i.e. breastfeeding the baby on one side while the big kid cuddles under moms other arm with their own drink.

The drugs caused me to not be able to stay awake and I thought for sure she was going to die.

I had have so much guilt over these things shes our third child and I feel like things could all have been prevented BUT accidents happen. Kids are resilient. Shes going to be alright.

Here are a few and where to find themNote The PBS Kids app has Chromecast Support so you can send shows to your TV.  There is also a PBS Kids app for Roku and probably other similar devices.  I also use the YouTube app on my Smart TV Roku or Phone to cast to the TV.

7652329,0,t3_4k495z,My first son shared a room with us for his first  years. We used a rock n play for the first  months then a pack n play until he was around  months then he shared the bed with us until we got him a twin bed when he turned . If you wanted you could side car a crib next to your bed for some extra room for you and your SO. I also love our arms reach cosleeper  its half the width of a traditional pack n play is a cosleeper until  months and then can transition to a pack n play later. I love that its half the width so it takes up less room in our already cramped room. Weve got  kids now and my older two boys  and  years old share a room while our youngest son whos  months shares a room with us.

Another good sign is she can tell you she needs to use the restroom before she goes.  My  year old son needed to move up a class in Montessori school but he had to be potty trained to do so.  I had been trying pullups to no avail.  Finally I did what one of the other moms stated and just put him in underwear and dealt with the accidents.  Number one took about  days and number  took almost two weeks but it worked.  I dont think he liked the feeling of being wetdirty.  Anytime he had an accident he had to help me clean it up and I would explain to him that big boys use the toilet and that he is a big boy.

8332283,0,t3_4tco7y,Hi! I had lots of questions too and ended up figuring them out as we went along. There are so many right answers to most of these depending on your unique familyliving situation. Its hard to say what will work best for any given family. That said I can say what worked for us.Umbilical cord  my husband was going to cut it but our son aspirated and needed to be cared for immediately so they cut the cord I think without even asking him. Cosleeping  We kept baby at our bedside in a bassinet and I would take him to his room to nurse him. When he got a little bit bigger I would bring him in bed with us and nurse him in bed with the plan of putting him back in his bassient but most of the time I would nod off and wed end up in bed together all night. I must say this was awesome as a breastfeeding mom. We moved to crib at about  or  months but he would still end up in our bed eventually when he woke to eat.Baby food  I am a full time working mom and we made all our own baby food. It was the only way I felt sure I knew exactly what he was eating. It was really easy. Id make a bunch of purees on the weekend while he napped put them in little baby food ice cube trays then move them to bags and label them with the date. Theyre good for up to  months in the freezer and you can combine flavors when thawing. Clothes  almost all of the clothes I get for my son come from a consignement place called Once Upon a Child. The only thing Id probably buy new clotheswise are onesies and pajamas. Our stroller was a handmedown from a friend whose daughter had outgrown it. Crying  my son is almost  and I still dont know why hes crying a lot of the time XD Usually when theyre newborns its because they are hungry. ,Mommit,d5j39ym,1,t5_2s3i3

A school friend did this to me when she saw a picture of my SO wearing my baby. She went overboard and send a whole load of info and articles about it. Fact is my SO is really really tall  she doesnt know because theyve never met so even though baby looked too low down he was at the highest setting but on a huge person. Perfectly safe. If she had done it publicly my defensive mummy would have probably snapped at her but since it was private I just said thanks so much its hard to tell in the pic but because SO is so tall baby is actually in exactly the right place.

8553691,0,t3_4wwp8e,I hate how rude mombie was. Having a kid because you want to be a mom is not exactly an unselfish decision. Youre doing what you want to do. I had kids because I wanted them. And while being a parent does require one to make some sacrifices with ones time and money that does not make me an inherently less selfish person than someone who chose not to have kids. Why would it? You can be a selfish asshole and still have kids. There are a lot of parents out there like that.It also doesnt make you more grown up. For fucks sake I spent the other evening in a blanket fort playing Monopoly Deal eating ice cream sandwiches and making fart noisestelling stupid jokes with my kids for two whole hours...if thats not the epitome of maturity I dont know what is. lol I hope I never grow up because that sounds boring as fuck.Mombie needs to learn not to be so selfabsorbed and to maybe also consider that her own choices are not as selfless as she thinks.

8708879,0,t3_4z7oue,Both our kids took about  nights and they started sleeping pretty much  hours right after that but I would recommend that you wait. In my experience any sort of change in routine specially when they have just been trained will bring a regression. Yes it will be easier to retrain once you are home think only one night of CIO but its not the end of the world for you to wait an extra month and that seems far more gentle on the baby. CIO is already brutal in its own right without adding to the madness Of course whatever you decide to do will be fine. If you do sleep train now just be very prepared for the possibility of a sleep regression dont expect your baby to sleep normally while on vacation and try to stick to his normal schedule as much as possible to ease the transition. ,Mommit,d6u8uvr,2,t5_2s3i3

9160034,0,t3_55nt1b,Ill add to what others have said and suggest you and your husband develop a routine for her that you both stick to.  My daughter is not a morning person and I never have been either.  Developing a routine has helped us immensely and if we get off track she is downright combative.  This part of her personality started developing around the time she was   and she is  now.So here is our routine  wake up family snuggles eat breakfast brush teeth use bathroom get dressed brush hair playtime pack backpack walk to school.  I pick her clothes based on the weather forecast.  I only let her choose if we have extra time.  If your child is picky let her choose the night before so you dont need to spend time on it in the morning.  I think if you guys got her on a routine your daughter would be less likely to argue because that will become just the way you do things.  After we established our routine everything started running faster and smoother.  If you were both doing things the same way in the same order it would probably help.

9661751,0,t3_5dacuu,Both. No hyphen just two last names. We decided the order based on what sounds best.Im only  months into this parenting gig so I dont have tons of experiences yet. I do know my kids name is already messed up at the pharmacy and at a specialists office. So I need to straighten that out. Pretty sure the receptionist at the specialists office was just being lazy when she said she couldnt do it because in her words my computer shows only one last name when I verified his insurance...lo and behold when our new insurance cards arrived my sons correct legal name was on them so I dont know what she was talking about. A little annoying. Especially since we live in an area with a large Hispanic population where two last names not hyphenated is relatively common.

9826675,0,t3_5fxtqv,So we just took a flight with our  and  year olds.  I have flown with my full size double inline stroller before and was able to check it at the gate and all went well.  Its just that it is bulky and with ours we had to remove the second seat to fold it so it came apart in  pieces.With our recent flight I sucked it up and bought a double umbrella stroller for like  on amazon for airport use.  It was amazing.  It folded so small and having the stroller was integral for keeping the kids with us in lines especially security not losing them in crowds and being able to move quickly on moving walkways.  Because there wasnt a ton of storage it kept our bags simple and we hung a diaper bag and backpack off the back while they were seated in it.  Tldr Id definitely go with a stroller.  And if you can swing it even better than the full size is the double umbrella.  ,Mommit,daofqmw,1,t5_2s3i3

For Christmas from just us and Santa she gotPrices estimates in CAD a play kitchen appliance set toaster coffee maker kettle plates utensils pan and egg  glow in the dark stars for her stocking dollar store  a twozie toy  a second hand little people car slide thing  a whale bath toy scoop  thomas and friends mini train case We kept it pretty modest money wise this year. Last year she got a pretty expensive kids piano toy  amongst some smaller presents. But she also got lots of other presents at both our familys houses. And her birthday is in a week. For that we bought her a toddler arm rocking chair  . And her birthday party with friends and family will be a week after that.It IS a lot of presents in a short span of time. But its enjoyable for us and shes a good kid. Last year for her birthday she got a toy airplane  a jack in the box  and maybe another small item. So it depends. Shes had a play kitchen for a while so when we saw the kitchen appliance set on sale a couple months ago we bought it and kept it hidden until xmas. Its things we want her to have. Shes still young so instead of a this is what i want list its things we think up for her. Our house is FULL of toys and were expecting baby . in a month... so we know the toys will continue to be played ifwith even when our first daughter grows out of them.

10200944,0,t3_5m0eqh,From having done the comebacktowork x now my main advicequestion is do you have flexibility on your return date?Both times Ive come back I started my boys at daycare on Monday but didnt start back to work until Wednesday. Got to practice my pumping routine for a couple days before having to do it at work getting muscle memory going for swapping parts around seeing approximately how long I wanted to go making sure the time spacing between pumps felt right Got to practice being away from the baby without worrying about being emotional  anxious in front of coworkers Got to focus on dealing with their inevitable firstdaysofdaycare woes without it also being tangled in my firstdaysbacktowork woes Got to have a bit of vacation time Other than that... Oatmeal for breakfast every day along with some mothers milk tea with a bit of honey if youre not a fan of the taste helps a lot for supply I often have to pump x at night including weekends to keep up with demand. It gets better as they get onto solids but its super stressful. Daycare may push you to provide more milk than you feel like you can pump. It will be infuriating and feel like JEEZ HUSBAND WAS FINE WITH X OUNCES WHY DO YOU NEED XWHATEVER YOU MUST BE OVERFEEDING MY BABY AND NOT COMFORTING THEM ANY OTHER WAY AND I CANT KEEP UP WAHHHHHH ... um that may be just me.  Twice.If that happens a few things  Remember that they are having to juggle multiple babies and despite all best intentions and care they just CANT invest as much  time.  Its okay they still love your kid and are doing what they can they really are. Stick to some guns. The oftcited .ozhr away is just not reasonable for a lot of daycare situations in my experience. But also more than ozday is ALSO probably not reasonable for  hours of care other than special occasions supply them with some frozen portions of oz for hungry days. If daycare tries to ramp you over that amount work with them to see what other soothing etc. can be done vs just trying to calm her with milk.Good luck!  With my first I pumped until  months started reducing pump sessions and topping off with cows milk at  year and nursed until  months. My second is just now  months and Im starting the same reduce sessions  cows milk top off now goodBYE evening pump woo.You can do this!,Mommit,dc0c19u,9,t5_2s3i3

10220462,0,t3_5m9y5l,Im  weeks used to be fit ran a marathon two months before conception and cried so many tears about feeling fat. I used to be overweight and I felt like my old body i worked so hard to get rid of was back again. My fianc was very kind about it all holding me when I cried and listening to my ramblings tickling my bump and telling me it was going to be ok even when I dont believe him. What helped calm me down the bump starting to show not weighing myself relying on my midwife to tell me if weightbump size were ok not Google images! and finding a few maternity clothes. HampM has a good affordable selection casual stuff very little of it is tentlike. They even do some maternity jeans that arent skinny! Ive had very few runins with people being shitty beyond an uncle who seemed to think that  to lbs weight gain is too much. Well fyou uncle youre severely overweight on the cusp of type  diabetes and have never had kids so your opinion doesnt count.

10251865,0,t1_dc5x82p,Yes! There is quite a bit of evidence that speech delays and disorders can be due to genetics. Check this article out that researches one family with a genetic link to their speech disorder Im not sure if there is genetic testing avilable to confirm this is the situation with your family but it would be very useful for future generations of your family to get this confirmed. Perhaps looking into a referral to a genetist would be worth it for you all. Your second question is a tough one because this behaviour is strongly linked to personality. I have two minds about this. My daughter is very verbal but also highly anxious so she doesnt like to talk to people she doesnt feel mentally and emotionally connected to and comfortable with. If your son has a speech delay there could be an added layer of stress to already stressful public interactions for him. Id ask him first at a different time what talking to people he doesnt know feels like for him. You can pretend and play little scenarios where he asks you questions that strangers have asked him and you answer and then switch roles. Whats most important is that his stress and anxiety are reduced. Stress and speech are inextricably linked as when we are stressed our brain shuts down electrical and chemical activity in the lobes we need for communication and activates the lower lobes and brain stem left over from when we were all lizards. So were good at fighting fleeing and freezing maybe what your son is doing but not good at clearly communicating our thoughts through language. Stress also causes your breathing to rise into the top of your lungs you breath through your mouth your muscles in your face jaw and throat tighten so its not only neurologically difficult to talk but straight up physically harder. Perhaps just protect him right now if strangers talk to him and let him know that its okay for him to not want to talk to them. I just ask my daughter  Do you want to talk to the nice man or would you like me to answer for you? As his confidence grows hell begin to want to say things on his own.  ,Mommit,dc63sqb,2,t5_2s3i3

11146053,0,t3_5z3vyo,My son just stopped using his pacifier just last week. He is almost  months old. We were like you didnt use it right away but once we realized it would console him when we couldnt it was in there a lot. Used it at the store in the car at daycare. Pretty much whenever he wanted it. I was a little worried he was using it too much and at his year old appointment his doctor said to limit it to naps and bedtime. So we did and he didnt have any issues. A couple months ago at daycare his provider said she had forgotten to even offer it at nap time in the beginning of the week and hadnt used it since. He still needed it at night. Then fast forward to last week. He went to go down to bed and I noticed there was a hole at the end of the pacifier. He had bitten through it. So then of course I panicked and didnt want him to have it in case he bit it off and choked. His other back up one in his bag also had a hole didnt even notice it before. Just to save that night I found and old smaller one for him to use. The next night I didnt offer it to him at all. At bed time I told him he has his teddies and taggie blanket for the night and hell be fine did our usual good nights and that was it. I was really worried he would cry for a while the first few nights but he didnt make a peep. He actually went to sleep faster!

I comb the long top part over and the sides are clipped short. Just want a few YouTube videos and you should be fine. The worst part is getting them to sit still!,Mommit,dgkuxga,3,t5_2s3i3
