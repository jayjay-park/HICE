3322420,0,t3_2y6nxm,As a hunter main I have found that standard facemidrange hunter works better than mech hunter. Imo the only classes that can pull off mech themes are Mage Shaman and Rogue in that order and even then oil rogue is a better option. It seems you have all the cards for mech mage namely antonidas and boom which are crucial for late game. Id go mech mage as it is a very strong deck atm. Pretty much most of the netdecks are great or at least good places to start. Im assuming you have most neutral mechs? i.e. shredder harvest annoyo clockwork mech yeti spider tank. Mech shaman is also great if you have power mace x but also benefits greatly from alakir. But overall Id say mech mage is your best bet. ,hearthdome,cp6zfvz,1,t5_375ip

3529051,0,t1_cptpyn6,Id have to agree with Fish on this one.  Tons of shaman play here as well and the one card I missed the most other than maybe Hex was earth shock.  ,hearthdome,cpujawk,1,t5_375ip
