97567,0,t1_cepdyfg,when festus and jermaine return it shouldnt be that glaring of an issue. Id still love a true back up PG but no one can truly fill Currys shoes at this point. With Barnes Festuz Draymond and Jermaine coming off the bench not to mention Kent Bazemore seems to be improving every game especially as a defender I am not TOO worried about depth. Even after saying all that though I would love to see another solid acquisition in the form of a pg or wing player before the all star break.EDIT Speights isnt shabby either hes been giving us some OK minutes while the other big men get healthy.,warriors,cepjdcj,2,t5_2rtiv

636774,0,t3_21fhud,This explainer leaves out two critical mistakes in Wojs article  Malone denied the not talking to Mark Jackson for weeks bit.  The original claim that Mark Jackson sought other coaching jobs over the past few months was changed to over the past year. This makes a huge difference.Woj really cant be trusted beyond  character snippets. Imagine if he was breaking the news as a tweet instead of an article. He would only have space to say that Scalabrine was reassigned by Mark Jackson. There wouldnt be much controversy or panic about team atmosphere.,warriors,cgcnguu,6,t5_2rtiv
637354,0,t1_cgcoyke,The first one seems to be a flat out lie. Everyone knew Jackson and Malone didnt get along so theres nothing new to report here. The fact that they didnt speak for weeks was supposed to be a revelation. That Woj got that wrong and did not even attempt to reach out to the parties involved to confirm discredits his piece.You cant deny the difference between Mark Jackson looking at other coaching positions over the last year and the past few months. Since his contract wasnt extended during the off season he would like any forward thinking person look at other options available. As a contractor if my contract is approaching expiration and I dont have a promise of renewal Im looking at other options. If Jackson had been doing this over the last few months then that would be a big deal since it shows that he has foot out the door.The whole piece reads like a hatchet job.,warriors,cgcpuni,2,t5_2rtiv

1464100,0,t3_2axkwp,Its a type of full court press. Playing prevent means a player staying near the basket usually a shot blocker big man so if the press is broken the offense wouldnt get an offensive layup. The defense was best employed in game  because the clippers played small because Blake griffin fouled out. It works better when the offense plays small because the offense cant punish the defense when the  is helping with the press at half court. The defense was also especially good because the clippers like to RUN so this was a defense that kept up with their offense. This was MUCH less effective the rest of the series because griffin had two fouls in game  only and then jermaine oneal was subbed out for draymond green so we didnt a defensive big man.,warriors,cizsu3l,2,t5_2rtiv

1792640,0,t1_ck4ccwe,Different roles. Klays job was to lock down his man which he did great. Dude has young legs and stays in really good shape.Iguodala is slightly older and much wiser. He was given the freedom to be a free safety type of defender and play passing lanes and hedgehelp on defense.Consequently we saw a lot of possessions where Klay shut his man down for  seconds and a lot where Iguodalas man got a shot off because Iggy made the smartest decision and let his man shoot a bad shot... IMO it doesnt mean one is better than the other they simply have different roles. And they depend on each other to do their jobs.Iguodala is still a more cerebral and tactical defender and his passing lane defense is probably the best in the league PG Kawhi Batum are competitors. But Klay is younger quicker and usually has a more focused assignment. Theyre both vital.,warriors,ck542ax,3,t5_2rtiv

I dont think thats chemistry thats just learning how to work with players you havent played with before. Yes the goal of any good team is to win the title of course. But only  team wins a title every year and they might just be the team that played extremely well at the right time not necessarily the best team. The regular season is a much better indicator of who the best team is. An game sample size compared to a at most game sample size against another team. Any one team can beat another team  out of  times if they play well and the other team struggles. Its not definitive proof that the team that won is a better team. There is an easy way to measure strength of scheduleSome teams suffer from injuries in the playoffs too like the Warriors last year and the Thunder. Its easy to tell the Warriors are an elite team were the best team in the NBA in defensive efficiency and the thbest team in the league in offensive efficiency The only teams close to us in qualifying in both categories are the Hawks th in defensive efficiency th in offensive efficiency have also played the easiest schedule in the NBA the Blazers rd in defensive efficiency th in offensive efficiency the Grizz th in defensive efficiency th in offensive deficiency and the Bulls th in defensive efficiency th in offensive efficiency and clearly none of those teams even approach our rankings in both categories. Obviously playoff wins and losses matter the most because if you love  games to a team there then your season is over. Yes any team wants to win the title but the team that wins the title isnt necessarily the best team.

2767346,0,t3_2rqep0,one factor to consider is the amount of practice time theyve had and the ability for players like Holiday to get time defending AllNBA players like Curry.  Also why not keep developing the lesserskilled playersSteph Bogut Lee Igoudala exemptedin game time.  The front office has worked hard to stack up players to prove now.  Think that isnt valuable?  Mozgov just scored two st Rd picks.  Whats the value of a Holiday for a team that needs a D guy?The financial implications are discussed like the warriors are a struggling business.

3142936,0,t3_2w5hix,No one said we were fine. Every team probably wants to improve something. But right now most teams need to give something up to get something else. Every player is fitting into his role nicely right now. Everyone exceeded expectations except for Brandon. If there happens to be a good backup rim protector out there who can score in the post and get rebounds while not costing us a core player then great. But theres not. Amare wont do shit here. And I think Festus will actually surprise us like he was right when he tweaked his ankle. If we matchup against bigger teams well out run them. Theres a difference between having no big men vs having few. Having Bogues there with  people Draymond size or shorter has worked wonders in the past. The Utah game was more a lack of offensive execution. Their size hurt us but its not like it exposed a liability. We just sucked. We lost to the Grizz because Steph couldnt hit a three to save his life and they couldnt miss in that second quarter. The thing is when we play up to our standards were a very tough team to beat. Teams are changing their roster to beat us. So maybe they add size. And? Weve got length speed and shooting on our side. Im not prone to hyperbole so I really mean this the main team we need to worry about stopping us is ourselves. Weve got surfeit talent to win a championship but we just need experience. Who gives a shit what other teams are adding. If anything we could use a shooter more than a big. ,warriors,conrglw,10,t5_2rtiv

3280840,0,t1_cp27ccv,Really good points. Better defender is very subjective but the only defensive metrics we have for guards is steals Steph leads the NBA on fewer minutes and team defensive efficiency Warriors still lead the NBA in that metric too. Neither are perfect but Steph has the statistical edge.  I guess there are some advanced SportsVu metrics showing stuff like opponent fg but I think a lot can be data overload.Then of course the eye test suggests Steph plays better team defense falls asleep on his man offtheball less often. If you want someone to guard Chris Paul would you pick Steph or Harden? Id even pick Steph over Harden to guard Klay or Bradley Beal.I dunno Im biased too.Personally if MVP is just about narrative then the award is less meaningful.

3439961,0,t3_2zlqca,This is what I wrote a month ago when people were saying Andre should start over Barnes  gt Barnes is the clean up guy for the other starters since he can expend the most energy hustling. He doesnt have to create leaving him open to roam around make back cuts set screens crash the boards and shoot an open  when StephKlay get double teamed. If he comes off the bench I feel there is not enough firepower to let him play this way. Id say box scores dont apply as much to guys like Barnes Dray Andre and Bogut since they do a lot of the dirty work.    If we treat Barnes as a scoring option thats where things fall apart. He does better as a clean up guy and is very active and athletic so let him be. Give him the ball when hes hot like last night but dont force him to shoot.

4264521,0,t1_cs6asb3,I still dont really comprehend what were doing right now.  years ago it was weirdawesome enough to actually be in a playoff series and being plain good that season but last season really stung. Other than a couple great stretches it was the first time losing hurt THAT bad losing always sucks and watching those  teams I think were all used to it and we just didnt get better. We lost some mindboggling games but I refused to think we were anything other than elite. Even though people never truly accepted us as championship contenders I knew for a fact that when we were healthy we could play the best of them. Too many comebacks and crazy games not to think so that one against the Raptors and Andre buzzerbeater against OKC was the sweetest. When we fired Mark I was in a kind of depressed state. Not that I wanted to keep him I knew we needed a change but for that coachless stretch I never felt more anxious. Do we fuck up and hire some guy who doesnt understand the team well? Do we get another defensive minded coach? It was late May when I was on my coach with a near empty bottle of sprite watching inside the NBA when I saw them show that tweet Steve Kerr is the new head coach of the Warriors. I was ecstatic. I thought he was gonna go to the Knicks. I loved his commentary on TNT and K. Dude always had a smile on his face and his understanding of the game really transcended most mortals. Just the way he analyzed stuff compared to his peers was a treat to listen to. I remember watching those playoff games with OKC and San Antonio and just remembering how happy and amazed I was that our coach was there candid and jovial calling those games. I skipped school to watch his press conference and boy was it a comforting experience listening to him. Never too audacious like Mark used to be. Realizing how good this team was but never setting expectations high. So humble too. It was then that I just knew we were gonna have a miracle season. We were gonna eclipse our previous record and be one of the top teams offensively. Admittedly I was on the Kevin Love bandwagon and thought it was insane not to trade for him. But when I saw Klay in FIBA I knew this was going to be a special season. Preseason I watched the ball whip side to side and Andrew really demonstrating his passing prowess. Everyone was jerking off to the Cavs OKC Spurs Clippers etc. going to the finals but with zero homerism I knew we were going to be one of the best teams. And even with my sky high expectations they shattered all that. I knew Harrison was going to start but I didnt think Andre was gonna be the one off the bench and I knew Draymond was this good a defender but never in a million years did I think he was gonna be one of the best one man fast breaks in the league. And with all that said we were actually healthy this season. I knew we were going to make the finals as the season came to a close but I didnt really understand what going to the finals meant. I still have trouble comprehending that were this close to being in company with those bulls and lakers teams. With the Spurs the same team that had our number. It still feels like the regular season. It still feels like weve got another gear to hit. And writing all this Im just beginning to notice how lucky we are to be fans of this team. Holy shit. ,warriors,cs6bvhx,8,t5_2rtiv

The entire area is a clusterfuck transitwise plus if you are sociable you can talk to some of the other fans who will be there.If you think you can smuggle food in it is certainly a viable though not graceful option. Oracle doesnt have many places to go before or after the game imo and food there is typical stadium food so if youve been to a Rams or Cardinals game youd get the ideaPlayer Basics Stephen Curry is our point guard team captain and usually our onthecourt general. Last year he broke the NBArecord for made s set by himself the previous year and was named league MVP. This year he is averaging something around  points a game very good and hasnt seemed to lose any of his form. I really dont need to go into much detail ask anyone around here what makes Steph so good and youll get hours worth of reading.Klay Thompson is our Shooting guard and general second in command next to Steph. He also is a very good shooter and set an NBA record for most points scored in a quarter at . His head looks like Squidwards house. Trust me you cannot unsee it. Hes streaky as a player having moments where he cannot miss a shot and then moments where he cannot score at all so everyone is waiting to see if he goes off again.Draymond Green is our Power Forward. His greatest strength is that he can guard almost any position on the court has a great court IQ and does the little things that help a team thrive. He is also incredibly mouthy in the best way possible. Last year he almost won Defensive Player of the Year and this year he seems to constantly be threatening to get a triple double getting double digits in points rebounds and assists every game.Harrison Barnes is our Small Forward. Hes a question mark doesnt show much emotion seems to not score as much as he was advertised to when drafted though he is the th scoring option on a team with  spectacular scoring options to start with and he seems to fade into the background some games. But there are moments where he comes up in the clutch and saves our asses and his athleticism cannot be discounted. His contract expires at the end of this season and no one is sure if he is returning to the team or not. urabsho hates him.Our Center is an interesting issue. Our starting Center is usually Andrew Bogut but he is out with a concussion and cuts to the head. In his place we have Festus Ezeli who has taken the opportunity to prove that he is a damn fine center able to block shots defensively and work the interior of the court offensively. His big weakness last year was being unable to catch passes but he seems to have rectified that.Well that turned out longer than I expected.

The Celtics never really managed to bust out a big run and his timeouts were a big reason for that.Id also agree that he ran out his best lineup for overtime and rode it to the end which is as much as you can ask for. He really did have just those  dudes who deserved crunch time minutes. Even LB is clearly not  yet. He got some run instead of Shaun every once in a while clearly to try and goose the offense a bit and he just couldnt turn the corner on his drives.Ive really enjoyed watching Walton grow as the season goes on too His usage of timeouts is a great example.

Remember Shaq got listed in the  greatest NBA players list after only four seasons. Curry current ranks among point guards th in career WS rd in BPM and th in PER. I say this as it currently looks like Curry is only getting better. I dont think I need to throw out stats to prove hes already the greatest shooter of all time. Dudes got a championship already leading a team that is statistically greater than any team Larry Bird Magic Johnson Shaq Kobe or LeBron have ever led. If Curry ends the season at the level hes playing at right now hed have arguably the greatest individual season of all time. He has a transcendent playing style that will affect the next generation of basketball players.

Doesnt ask for more shots and only shoots when open while playing with the starters. Tries to do a little more with the bench but still doesnt try to do too much.Like with the starters every time Barnes shoots unless its a dunk its technically a bad shot  it means CurryKlay didnt shoot it. Hell even having him touch the ball is kind of a bad strategy. CurryDray should be the ball handlers BogutDray should be the screeners and heKlay are the floor spacers. It doesnt mean hes bad hes just not as good as the people around him. With that said if he doesnt start making the open s Rush may have to take his spot at the  because thats basically his entire job with the starters.Barnes should still get the minutes at the  when Dray is out or playing  since his defense seems significantly better there than Rush and shooting isnt as important.,warriors,d19qubg,10,t5_2rtiv

Over their last  games they have a point differential of . compared to the season average of .Against the spread the Warriors are  which includes covering a Utah game they should have lost.

Hes more like a swiss army knife where he can do everything well but doesnt really excel in one category besides defense. If you want someone to go off for  than that player should be Klay not Draymond.

7687780,1,t1_d3g1icq,Unclear if trolling being sarcastic or you believe that my response depends on that distinction as guessing wrong would make said response poorly made to address..whatever the original intent is.EDIT Actually no I saw the comment history Ill just assume you think that.The thing is...a professional is a professional. No one is that much of a dick. I dont care that its Draymond Green and the verdict has already been written on him in rnba circles. He most certainly needs to learn tact....cause his actions after hard fouls are exactly what gets him his reputation but at the same time I dont fault him for wanting to brand himself as a passionate player.In this circumstance...I disagree. Mostly because I can feasibly see his progression of actions as an attempt to draw attention to a foul and also because I dont believe anyone intentionally goes full tilt into someones balls unless they truly are a jackass. I dont think Draymond is. I think hes a little too rough when the Lakers we really do suck and I dont think thatll change unless Luke truly is a chosen one play the Warriors but I dont think hes intentionally dirty. I actually think no one in todays league is. Your Bill Laimbeers and hell...your Rasheed Wallaces of the league are gone its too easy to finesuspend them. It doesnt happen with Draymond not because the NBA is corrupt as shit and wants to prop up a California franchise but because he just isnt that bad.I get why people hate him but fuck I grew up with s basketball there is a certain point where you do indeed need to go holy shit guys it was way worse back then. And no I dont mean in terms of nutchecks but in terms of truly hard fouls that would easily be flagrant s today.EDIT  A good example of this is seeing the  for  on Reggie Miller its on Netflix for sure iirc. Guarantee some people would be screaming for ejections on some of those fouls today. Im not wrapping this back around to a Warriors win in a soft league argument its a we understand we dont want CTE in every fucking sport we have our athletes provide entertainment for  years and it would be nice if they lived another  years after they were done.,warriors,d3g1w48,-3,t5_2rtiv

7703248,0,t1_d3hhzae,I absolutely get that things like that look worse in slow motion.  But he was looking straight at Adams the whole time not at the rim like he was actually trying to take a shot.  And then for the comments postgame about how he didnt know it happened or why they were reviewing it until seeing it on the replay are laughable.  There are  a season...  And you see the play from the game before multiple times a year.  Ive never seen that play Draymond did happen before.  Does that mean it is impossible from an inadvertent contact perspective?  No but that would definitely imply that their is a statistical improbability to it.,warriors,d3ht3js,1,t5_2rtiv
7704446,0,t1_d3hxp8w,I agree and I even feel the same way about important players fouling out after silly calls. It sucks that games end up being decided because of things like that.

I walk around the streets of the bay area and I notice way more Curry tshirts and jerseys compared to Klay Thompson ones. Whats crazier is he just doesnt care about being under the shadows of Curry. Having this type of relationship is super rare with another star and just makes me respect him so much more. Dude has played amazing the entire season but his performances at times goes unnoticed just because of how much Curry shines. Not last night though. Last night was Klays time.Im super grateful for Steph making the team around him better. Last night he trusted and believed in Klay by getting the ball to him.

I love basketball and sure trash talk is part of it but man some are just really uncalled for and plain stupid. I actually like the witty ones but some are just really cringe worthy.Ive also seen some comments wanting some players to get badly injured. That is just inappropriate. I dont even know why they would want that to happen to another human being! Its like they forget these players have families a career a life and isnt a freakin video game character that has nothing beyond a basketball game.I respect the fans defending our team. I help by down voting whoever youre arguing against but I just prefer not to engage in some conversations. Sure I laugh at some but I guess I just dont like being disrespectful. I dont even brag. I celebrate like hell but I wouldnt go in other subs and rub it in their faces. I just think their team losing is enough. But hey thats just me. To each their own.,warriors,d3v9ylf,1,t5_2rtiv

That was also before the voting was public which makes me wonder if those holdouts would have bucked the trend if they knew their names would be associated with it. The other thing that I am loathe to post here is... well maybe it was injuries suffered early in the Rockets series the shoulder that huge lump on his elbow but he didnt exactly play like an unanimous MVP in the finals.

8280467,0,t1_d5clpl7,Alright no worries about that then.I feel that he was pretty damaging during the playoffs a few times. Sure there were good moments too but again I dont feel like they were greater than the many times he cost the team. I dont think that Kerr has shown a willingness to bench players when he maybe should. I think Kerr was in a tight spot with some of the rotation stuff in the playoffs but that Varejao still played and cost the team way too much in my opinion.As for the culture thing I get that hes nice and likable and its certainly way better than having someone who is completely toxic on the benchin the locker room. I dont know that his particular personality is necessarily what contributes to a winning culture despite the fact that the players all seem to like him. In other words I believe that it is possible that a guy be both a good teammate and a negative impact on the culture as it relates to success in the league. Obviously thats wild speculation but then most of the stuff people saythink about team culture is based on some level of speculation. Clearly culture has an effect on winningteam chemistry but its pretty near impossible to measure tangibly so most of what we say about it is just conjecture one way or another. ,warriors,d5cm8if,1,t5_2rtiv

9321617,0,t1_d8xkdiu,I do believe his reasons. But you need to look deeper.KD said he left because he enjoys the way GSW plays likes the people ect.Why does he like the way GSW plays? Because it leads to winning. Winning leads to happiness. Winning leads to RESPECT. When you are not respected you are not happy. He said he likes the players. Why? Cause Curry Green Klay and Iggy respect him. They share the ball with him. Coach Kerr respects KD. I dont think Russ or Donovan gave KD that level of respect. People are more happy when they work with people who RESPECT them. Thats a fact.,warriors,d8xl0lw,5,t5_2rtiv

Hes had several seasons on the Thunder where he averaged over  and this is without  elite shooters in Steph and Klay and hell Dray knocks them down tooIm interested to see how his rebounding numbers go this year though. Hes one tall and quick mfer and rebounds generally go longer since you guys are an outsideshooting team  maybe thatll give him an advantage on boards once theyre out of reach from the big guys closer to the rim.,warriors,d9lra6u,2,t5_2rtiv

Im actually pleased to see it play out and result in a  record.

9903860,0,t1_dayhvd9,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,warriors,dayhvgv,2,t5_2rtiv

10766654,0,t1_ddqhawn,I get that but the comment I was replying to was calling him a hidden gem and I think thats extremely generous based on what weve seen so far.Also the depth is Curry Livingston Clark then Weber right now.  Weber is nice to have but hes not absolutely critical for depth.  He was replacing Varajao and we were doing just fine with an extra C on the roster.At the moment Briante is worth a roster spot.  If someone like Bogut gets bought out at the deadline Id rather have Bogut if hed come back for the vet min.  If no one good is an option after buyouts most likely then Id sign Briante to a two year deal with a team option.  But Im not expecting him to be anything more than regular season depth for this year at least.,warriors,ddqi16d,4,t5_2rtiv

11677153,0,t3_66mc66,Draymond was a little overweight couldnt shoot a midrange to save his life but had high ball iq and great defenseenergy. His favorite shot was that trailer  in a fast break scenario. When David Lee got injured you really saw him step up. He was always great defensively but his jump shot stopped him from being efficient. He has grown so much as a player and is dedicated to make this team better. His conditioning has improved his defense but his offense is improving every year too. Seeing Draymond take the ball from coast to coast is something I thought I would never see from him. ,warriors,dgjme6c,56,t5_2rtiv

11724871,0,t1_dgp1fnd,I have a few memories of Stephen that you might like.I remember sitting with his future roommate Bryant Barr at a DavidsonPrinceton game when he and Bryant were seniors in high school and I was a junior. We looked across the gym and said Hey theres that Stephen Curry kid who is coming here next year.Stephen walked over to his dad who gave him  to get some Ben amp Jerrys.Two years later I was playing basketball for Furman University Davidsons Rival. After Steph hit a few threes in a row Davidson ended up fouling one of our players. I was lined up next to Stephen for the free throws and turned to him and said Chill out man.... He ended up getting the outlet pass and I picked him up in transition. He proceeded to drain a step back jumper right in my grill.,warriors,dgp1m40,18,t5_2rtiv
