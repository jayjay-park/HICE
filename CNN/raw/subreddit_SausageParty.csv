10688381,0,t1_ddi3mxx,HAAAA!Oh man youre a riot. Go on go find some Organic Mommy journal and claim its just as valid a source as any scientific journal I could cite. Go find some poorlytested piece of feminist theory dreamed up in a shittier college with manipulated results and a laughable lack of ethics and claim its just as valid a source as anything actuallyscientific I could bring up.Youre scared arent you? Youre afraid so youre throwing shit at me and my sources while claiming Im ideologically driven. Why? Because I refuse to take your shit or accept your ignorance as an excuse. But go on keep projecting. Even if I got though your wall of brainwashed ignorance youd yell I dont have time for you if youre gonna refuse to understand me! and run away in tears. Then in eight hours youll forget this ever happened. Youll repress all memory of this but youll start using words and phrases I used remembering that they were powerful argumentwinning phrases even if you dont quite understand what they mean or why they beat you.After all thats why youre using big and powerfulsounding words like Ideologically driven to describe a list of ethical breaches your people commited.,SausageParty,ddife70,1,t5_2ysyo
