It would have to go through the state legislature and I didnt hear anything about it during their last session which just ended.

Consider the services you need and proximity to work and home.Youll need to do some homework to pick out which features you like best.  For instance my North Carolina credit union offers a variable interest rate on deposits based on how many debit card transactions you make monthly.  My Utah credit union with Las Vegas branches has a flat relatively high interest rate.  Both offer Internet banking free transfers to internal and external accounts free checking with a minimum  deposit etc.  My Utah CU can offer home and auto loans in Nevada.Its worth your while to visit pick up brochures or talk to someone and find out which one has the services you need.,vegaslocals,dd674ka,1,t5_2xdzp
