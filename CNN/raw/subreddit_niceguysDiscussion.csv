4399578,0,t3_3ben7u,Ultimately no matter how selfish it may be or how immature it may seem if certain relationships are causing you a lot of stress and heartache its probably best to take a step back from them. I have dated women weve broken up and Ive remained quite close friends with one or two. With others I barely see them again. Just like you are not entitled to have her as a girlfriend shes not entitled to have you as a friend. Im not all saying that this is should used as some sort of means to punish her for not dating you but if youre just overcome with sadness or jealousy every time youre around her thats a you problem you have to work on. Theres little worse than that gnawing feeling in your gut when you see a woman you like thought you had a chance with with another guy. Its tough but its life and you just move on. ,niceguysDiscussion,cslkf3d,10,t5_38utc
4862917,0,t1_cu7dv9g,First seriously. Read the book I told you. It sets the bases for human interaction.gt How does an actual adult begin conversation? Where do you start at? Ive tried the whole How about that weather? thing but A it tends to come off as really desperate for a conversation which makes me feel like theyre thinking Im just trying to get in their pants and just rushed in without having anything genuine to say and B Weather around here tends to be generally stable enough that its not worth talking about.With a purpose. Are you there just to have conversation? then gossip. Ask for information about the place. A purposeless conversation dies quickly.You want to know a person? Ask himher the typical questions about themselves people fucking love talking about themselves youll learn that in the book. For each information try to ask a genuine question like youre really interested and if you can add something of your own experience into the conversation. I dont care how lame you think its your live people usually have compassion and charisma and like to know about the people theyre speaking with.gtWhat do you talk about? I cant really talk about my interests because no one around here is gonna be like Oh you like watching Kids Shows and playing Video Games? Gee that sounds like the interests of a fully matured individual that Id like to converse more with and not like a socially impaired whackjob that I need to get away from.Yes when getting to know new people one usually talk about ones interests. And let me tell you something no matter your interests other people dont give a damn about them. They like THEIR interests not yours. The gist is to sell your own interests as interesting as engaging. If you give the impression that youre ashamed of them why should people know that you like what you like?A suggestion anime and videogames are fine sticking only at anime and videogames is not. People evolve people try new things you should too.gt How do you know when a conversation should end? Typically any conversation I have with my family just sort of stops as I awkwardly walk away up to my room same with a lot of other conversations with passerby.When you run out of topics to discuss like you both have exchanged the latest news of your life or the conversation has already fullfilled its purpose a best thing to do is say one of the typical lines like thanks for the informationIts good to see youre wellI should get going then followed by a See yaLets meet again and whatever. In case of your family you could say Im going to my room see ya. It looks boring and overused but thats it.gt How do you know if youre going too far? I mean the very idea of walking up to a complete stranger and trying to interrupt their probably busy schedule just to talk to them about stupid shit they dont really care about already sounds like its sort of stepping within the boundaries of personal space. How would you know when to stop talking? How would you know if someone shouldnt be talked to in the first place?Ill answer tomorrow,niceguysDiscussion,cu7iaa9,2,t5_38utc

6886890,0,t3_4a2q5g,So sometimes friends do talk about deeper things because they are comfortable with the person. It sounds like she is comfortable with you and the distance could be a range of things especially if it is onoff constantly.As for your fears. The fear of rejection is probably because you like having her as someone to talk to and you fear that that may disappear if you ask her out. Your fear of acceptance is a bit tricky but Ill try my best GO AND GET HELP. There are many places that you can go to get help but it is up to you to get help there is nothing wrong with it. If you are in school most offer a counseling service if not look up where there are places for you to get help.Discuss your insecurities with that person it will likely help you come to accept andor deal with your insecurities.In other words you dont sound like a NiceGuy just someone that needs help.,niceguysDiscussion,d0wy2fo,5,t5_38utc
7221007,0,t1_d1yyl89,Exactly. All I needed was a friend or teacher or someone to tell me that I wasnt worthless that Id get over it and that theyd be there for me while I did that. But I didnt have anyone. I couldnt even let my parents know I had these feelings or theyd mock me for it or at best not know what to say.I discovered this after reading this comment on MetaFilter specifically this partgtI felt worthless  I was so desperate to have someone have a crush on me the way I hopelessly had on others and in one fell swoop I learned that nobody felt that way. I didnt have an outlet for those feelings the friend of mine who knew told others and only amplified my shame and so I bottled them up.All my life I just wanted to to feel like someone felt the same way about me as I felt about other people. And I systematically learned that nobody felt that way about me and that nobody would ever feel that way about me.And once youre convinced that youre annoying unwanted and unworthy its not hard for it to poison every other relationship that youre in. A couple girls in middle and high school managed to make it past my defenses and get into a relationship with me but they didnt last that long because I didnt call them on the phone because I didnt think they wanted to hear from me. I still dont think people want to hear from me so I dont stay in touch with people so I still dont have anyone to talk through feelings about.,niceguysDiscussion,d1yz21t,2,t5_38utc
7770363,0,t3_4lhoug,I did not downvote you. What you write is pretty brutal but at least you are honest. I do think that you touch upon an important point. Our society is still not fully capable of grasping the concept of just having fun. Finding a partner forming ties settling down this is still very ingrained in our society. Not doing that is viewed as egoistic and in case of women it often ends up in slut shaming.I think it would make a lot of things much better if it were perfectly OK to search for quick hookups and be able to honestly openly saying that. Tinder is a development in this direction. I think it is totally OK to be honest about this. What is not OK is if you reject and the other person does not accept it or some guy thinks he can behave like a macho sexist douchebag who treats women like walking sextoys.But since our society puts so much emphasis on finding a partner for life the very real and valid desire for just having a good time goes under. I am sure goodnice guys I mean genuinely nice guys now would be ok with just having a good time if it werent so stigmatized. This leaves the jerks who simply dont care about stigmata.,niceguysDiscussion,d3pfex4,1,t5_38utc
8026278,0,t1_d4i7dv6,Well i had time to process my thoughts. Im def making efforts to move on by being more social again.,niceguysDiscussion,d4i892u,1,t5_38utc
9163976,0,t3_55nvs0,I agree from my experience having an attractive personality with qualities you mentioned but also good social skills is important as well. If you cant make a good impression on the girl and spark a conversation with the person instantly showing the jist of your personality then the person youre trying to get with wont be attracted to you as easily regardless of how kind you are. Some nice guys try to be smooth or overly kind to make up for whatever social skills they lack. Yet again I am only in my senior year of high school so I have much to learn and may be wrong with my point. ,niceguysDiscussion,d8dln6l,2,t5_38utc
10086190,0,t1_dbm8mo6,gtAs a feminist feminism at is core is effectively unlearning things youve been taught your whole lifeAnd thats where youve lost any credence to me. Of course you would think this way when you see all men as evil oppressive patriarchs. ,niceguysDiscussion,dbm8yk2,-3,t5_38utc

10909149,0,t1_de36k0z,The only reason I loved that book is the perspective on the dating game. Instead of worrying about the massive amount of chances you have just tailor yourself to the person you think you would date and filter out as time goes on. One of the biggest things he said in the beginning about this methodology is that the numbers game is impossible to achieve if your goal was to date all of the women in the world so instead of worrying about how many? you should worry about is this what I really want? For instance I would cater what I not from media or attention would like to do instead of approval from the people I am attracted to. If the new hobby I am introvertly interested in does not bring any new relationships then I would either expand my own knowledge to other hobbies derive results and concepts between hobbies or expand on my list of hobbies. In my opinion this mantra refreshes your headspace and adds character to your life. The more you expand who you are the closer you become to someone who not only compliments your lifestyle but melds together the jigsaw between your lifeIm sleepy at the moment posting this  I wouldnt mind answering any questions you may have,niceguysDiscussion,de579g8,1,t5_38utc
11478124,0,t1_dfv1oxh,well youre further along than the nice guys then. maybe people say that because they cant really see anything wrong with you but arent necessarily romantically attracted to you and cant understand why and so thats their answer. well youre such a great guy. just the best!I think theres a difference between stop trying and stop caring. when one is trying they are seeking approval from others and then disappointed when they dont receive that approval especially when they try and be nice to receive it. and then the caring comes in there too. to not care in my opinion would mean knowing that your validation doesnt come from love from another person or approval from your peers. to know that maybe youre not the greatest person in the world but youre doing your best and fuck all if the rest of the world doesnt appreciate you. then the rest of the world doesnt deserve your appreciation either. and I think going this route without the endgameof itll come means that you wont be disappointed if it never does. the unaimed arrow never misses. and if you dont have expectations youll never be disappointed. ,niceguysDiscussion,dfx1i92,1,t5_38utc
