191283,0,t1_cf06ftr,I kind of agree with this? Like I know this mv is supposed to be uncomfortable and its really well done but... it did make me quite uncomfortable. Like to me it doesnt look like a couple fighting as much as him trying to force himself on her. Especially when you read the English translation of the lyrics and he is singing things like Dont push me away why not we love each other and she replies Stop it Im sorry fuck you I dont want it now. Im pretty sure in the song this is supposed to be that she doesnt want to have sex with him because the relationship has gone bad not that hes trying to force her but when you put it in along with the images in the mv it made me feel troubled. I actually thought the blood was a suicide attempt at first? But then I went back and realised he was there too which makes me think hes beaten her. And then at the end he pours something over himself  gasoline?  and starts flicking a lighter like hes about to murdersuicide them. I found the video upsetting. That isnt necessarily a bad thing this didnt feel like it was romanticising violence in a relationship or anything.I think its really powerfully done  but Im not sure if it quite fits with theme of the song? The song seems to be about a couple falling apart whereas to me this video feels like its portraying an abusive relationship. I really do love the song though. And like I said I dont dislike the video Im just not quite sure how well it relates to the song....,kpop,cf086io,15,t5_2r1ox

The dancing was a bit... well not as impressive as the song but its okay sometimes I thought they were randomly flailing their arms around and it looked messy but that might be just me.

He seems to really enjoy performing this song and it SHOWS. What a fun performance! Also I forgot KBS made Girls Day change their choreo. It seems even more tamer than their previous change too lazy to confirm but this time it seemed really awkward to me.

He has been promoting for  straight years but unlike his other lablemates he never goes on variety. And that resistance wasnt just from S.M. broadcasting agencies didnt want to air HoMin for a while Keep in mind SM and Mnet and KBS have a history of not playing nice with each other And then you have Song Ji Hyo a women from CJeS. The company that was established for meeting and aiding JYJs activities. That was their mission statement and someone from that agency will be broadcasted with your artists. Dont expect a solo tour from Yunho that can match Jae and Junsus. Hes not a main vocalist rapper and dancing doesnt help him much now that EXO is out and about. His only outlet would be performing with SM Performance unit while Changmin returns from military.I can see him leaving S.M. but I cant see Changmin leaving S.M. since hes invested so much into them.

Of course I would be able to differentiate each member if I had more experience with each group.I thought the songs I listened to at first were underwhelming and a lots of the vocal colors of the members in each group were not unique andor were very similar.

However Idol groups as a whole in the US have not been nor are the currently brought to the same level as those in Korea. SNSD is South Koreas National Girl Group. Maybe Im wrong but I dont remember the Backstreet Boys or Nsync receiving titles such as these. Fandoms for groups such as DBSK Bigbang EXO ne SNSD etc. are very large. Idol groups in the US also had very large followings but it was different because it was not as nationalized. Just my two cents.,kpop,cg6azqh,1,t5_2r1ox

613516,0,t1_cg9ys5k,That is the thing to keep in mind isnt it?   Many KPop songsincluding a great deal of SMs output whether its Run Devil Run or Mr. Mr. or even oldies like Dreams Come True or Dont Start Now are really Western pop songs composed by Westerners paid for by SM paired with Korean lyrics and released to the KPop market.  Sure their original versions arent always releasedleaked in the West but essentially musically theyre Western pop.Thats not to say that theres nothing KPoppy about these imported songs though its one reason that lines are blurred between Western pop and KPop the fact is that theres a selection process involved and one would think that songs are chosen based on what they feel the KPop audience wantsneeds so that even if these imports are taken into consideration theres still some detectable distinction between the KPop landscape and what we hear on the American Top  radio.  In addition theres also a distinction between the lyrical styles of Korean pop and Western pop that goes beyond mere translationlanguage differences and the Korean lyricists apply their own sensibilities to the words they write to the Western songs.  It turns a mishmash of shallow metaphors like Keshas version of Run Devil Run into a song with vivid downtoearth imagery about disguising girls names as boys in ones phone contact list and smelling another girls perfume on ones man it turns the empty look Im so attractive swag of Teddy Rileys The Boys into an anthem of empowerment.,kpop,cga0bbm,5,t5_2r1ox

659044,0,t3_21ohe0,Group name Ferocity or Fierce Femme not sure which one I like moreFan club  QueensMembers CL NE  Leader vocalsrapper her presence in the group would be extremely similar to how she is in NE except she would sing more.Hyuna Pominit  Rapper she would have more of a sleazy kind of rap style like she did in Now and maintain her sex symbol spot like she does in MinuteAilee  Main vocalist she would pretty much do lots of fierce things like CL but serve mainly as a contrast. CL is the swaggyfierce and Ailee would be the classyfierce. Lots of hair whips. Lim Kim  Vocalist most of the groups songs will have a very low temp point which either builds up or breaks down depending on the song and Lim Kim would have this entire part to herself in terms of vocals choreography and stage time. Gain Brown Eyed Girls vocalist she would be very sexy and do lots of sexy high notes with her voice and lots of other sexy stuff with her body. She would be involved in a scandal consisting of a sexual relationship with her manager meeeeeMint TinyG DancerMaknae  think Miss You Mint where she looks like a baaaaaad bitch.  Thats the Mint I want and she would be so fierce. The group would do mostly sultry and jazzy music with some electronic infused. Think songs like Partition by Beyonc Full Moon GNAAL and they would also shock their fans by doing some mad dirty trap songs. Theyd be involved with a lot of American producers and Brave Brothers.  Their biggest hit would be called He Be Talkin  featuring Verbal Jint and GD. The song would sound kind of like Bubblegum by Jackal except a little less ratchet more minimalistic during the parts outside of the drop and this would be the song where the members who dont fit in too well Lim Kim and Mint would really come out of their shell causing the group to soar in popularity. He Be Talkin  song and MVwould be about a guyGD who is telling his boyVerbal Jint about the three CL Hyuna and Mint girls hes datingcheating with at the same time and his boy is dating Lim Kim who    catches wind of their conversation and hears how he wants to do it too. Little so they both know that All  girls are friends and when Lim Kim informs them they try to set up Verbal Jint by using Gain and Ailee at a night club. Since VJ is mad smooth he thinks he gets both Ailee and Gain for a one night stand or more and takes them home. While theyre walking home all the girls confront GD and VJ and essentially beat them up. The choreography would be very sexyseductive and close to being banned. He Be Talkin would set the standard for sexy concepts done right in kpop.Bonus group the two that left Muses form a group called Nugus. ,kpop,cgf6ldj,16,t5_2r1ox

880428,0,t3_246jaf,Uhhh been to one Music Bank in Seoul. My friend organised the tickets so I have no idea how much they were Im sorry. If its the same  I do know is that the show is a little less than twice the length of the live show. This is because some groups perform first they tape the audiences reaction and they tape the stage. Then the groups come out again and do the live stage. I think this is in case of a problem they can refer back to the taped version. Also sometimes they take the cheers of one group and put it for another as long as there arent any fanchants. At least thats what my friend told me. When I was there the fans didnt chant or cheer for a group and so the producer came out to tell us that we should please be nice to the rookie groups pI dont think youll have that problem though!,kpop,ch4cwbn,3,t5_2r1ox

The best example would probz be CLs The Baddest Female I have such a lovehate relationship with that song and its MV. I LOVE CL but omg I covered my face with my hands and looked away during some parts. Like when shes wearing the grills ugh. Also someone needs to ban Taeyang and Dara from braids and corn rows.Basically I love hiphop styling most of the time.

The borders just make it worse.Song less EDMbased than I thought just has a lot of strong influences from it. Mostly evident in the bass and almost entirely electronic instrumentation. They definitely got the club vibe Im assuming they were going for. Song is pretty unmemorable but Ill take it. Bit disappointing after Number Nine is all. Also what the hell was their choreographer thinking with that hip sway chorus dance?The bodysuits are pretty Mr. Taxiesque. As a side note it never fails to amuse me how much they blatantly throw promiscuous Jiyeon in the middle of all the group shots. Also the ass shots. She does looks a lot older in this video. Think its a change in the eye makeup plus actually being you know older. Love the ponytail look in the jumpsuit.

1904201,0,t3_2gfcll,Pann Analysis of SNSD members competitivenessTLDR Staying in SNSD is good for them they will probably go for more than  yearsgt                       sm                     Yoona Shes pretty. But her dramas all get low ratings. She doesnt really get criticized for her acting but shes not good either. She keeps getting cast in dramas for her SNSD title but the future is undecided. If she succeeds to the maximum shell be the next Sung Yuri.gt                                       sm       Taeyeon Shes a good singer but there are a plenty of other singers who can sing like her. And her weak mentality is the problem. Her mentality is as weak as Asada Mao. Its not like her singing is extremely outstanding and she doesnt compose songs so she cant be a singersongwriter. Her voice is not that unique either. I think shell stick with SNSD until the end. When SNSD leaves SM shell be the first member to disappear in the entertainment industry.gt       ....                                              Jessica Her singing is OK. As for acting... the right side of her face is weird. In dramas the cameras film the actors everywhere so unless she fixes the right side of her face itll be a problem. Besides her acting is not that good either. But mostly I dont think she wants to last long as a celebrity. I think shell get married to a rich guy when shes still in SNSD.gt                                  Tiffany The only advantage of Tiffany is her English skills. It cant really help her with being a celebrity. I also think she has the biggest pride of being a SNSD member. It might be a bad thing when she promotes as solo.gt             ?                           Seohyun She always tries hard but shes like a female version of Changmin. I know shes trying hard but I just cant see anything outstanding about her. She still has the modesty in her though. Personalities are important for lasting long so we never know.gt                                Hyoyeon She has good personalities and shes talented in dancing. I think shell survive even if shes thrown in the middle of a desert. She doesnt do acting or anything but I just think shell survive somehow.gt                                                             Sooyoung I was very surprised with her acting. Tbh her looks are mediocre but after watching Cyrano Agency I did think she could be more successful than Yoona. Yoon Eun Hye got popular when she was a nugu in Baby Vox and Hwang Jung Eum is the most popular member in Sugar when Park Soo Jin was the visual. Looking at these cases I dont think successes are based on looks. I think if Sooyoung promotes alone shell be much more successful.gt                                      Yuri Its hard to judge. I personally thought Yuris looks were suited for acting more than Yoonas. I think Yuri will also go with acting but her acting is mediocre and her image is bland. I guess itll depend on how she tries but for now its hard to judge.gt                                            Sunny Honestly I think she has the least competitiveness. Her looks her singing her talents nothing about her is special. Shes short and her looks are average so she cant do acting. Her singing is mediocre so she cant do singing. She shined on variety shows with her good personalities so if were looking at her longterm career shell only be an MC on Quiz To Change The World..   No one would know it except the members but I think its wellwritten from an outsiders perspective..   Tbh all the nine members will flop if they leave SNSD and SM. Even when they hit  theyll be forgotten. .   I think Taeyeon will be a vocal trainer. Honestly shes the idol who can deliver emotions the best..   Really daebak you have the same thoughts as me! This is also how I thought. Im not a SNSD anti I always listen to their songs and I blasted I Got A Boy while others hated it. I think this is a very objective point of view. Some might find this post offensive but the members might realize their flaws. I especially find Tiffany being too proud of SNSD... Im not saying SNSD is not amazing but the way Tiffany behaves shows it too much. I hope she stops....   They dont have to be celebrities forever they could be fashion mentors staff composers and etc. So stop spending your time writing this and worry about your future..   Even though we write stuff like this SNSD is already rich as hell... Theyre able to feed three generations at least .   The most useless thing is to worry about celebrities. Even though they leave the entertainment industry theyll leave rich lives until they die.,kpop,ckin7tt,35,t5_2r1ox

They were consistently a little below not by much at all but still below PM on the digital charts. It was their physical sales unusually high with this comeback due to lottery tickets for a showcase being included in every physical copy so a lot of fans bulk bought for better chances and their SNS points I dont mind admitting a lot of Angels including ones I know personally used bots to tweet the two hashtags every couple of hours that grabbed them the win.

They had Tell Me So Hot and Nobody that just wrecked everything in site while SNSD only had Into the New World do well. And then in  JYP decided to ship them off to the US which allowed SNSD to have pretty easy pickings in Asia especially with Gee. If WG never left Korea theres a good chance they wouldve still been a top group and solidified JYPs Big  status.PM with Jay were doing well too. They were competing with Shinee SUJU and UKiss when they debuted. They were doing well until the Jay thing happened.

2183406,0,t1_clhcii8,I was similar! I think we all started out that way. This might be lengthy with history and links and all that but...BIGBANG is my group an YGE is my company. Sorry if its too much!Ill link the song titlesI think its important to hear La La La and BIGBANG You dont have to like them at all. But its their roots and where they really started.  side note it sheds some light on where YGE was at the time in a music sense. Its very turn of the decade hiphop.Sunset Glow was postLies and postHaru Haru. While those two songs were the breakout hits this song to me really shows how they werent all about the hippity hop and were going to branch out musically.You mentioned Tonight and its one of my favorites. Love Song is from the same album and era. This is modern BIGBANG coming together.    side note the year or so surrounding Tonight was...I dont want to be dramatic and say a dark period but this is where things went down.     Daesung had his motorcycle accident GD had his marijuana scandal they were on hiatus and had solo activities and looked like they were on the outs they were at the  year mark.     They won the an award at the  EMA and that somehow jumpstarted everything again.If Tonight was their forming a new sound their Alive and Still Alive EPs were the product of that. You mentioned Fantastic Baby and Monster already. Blue is ballad BIGBANG in full form. Love Dust is another example of how  vocalists and a rapper can each put in their parts but still feel like a group. Bad Boy is what I call a mature return to their roots.In fact. Alive and Still Alive are worth a listen from start to finish. Ill stop here for the sake of brevity. Everyone has amazing solo material as well Taeyangs Rise especially. In fact YGs great year started with Seungris latest album has continued on.If you would like suggestions on those and I can just spit out links instead let me know.There are obviously many more songs I didnt cover but this is a nice overview.,kpop,clhd426,2,t5_2r1ox

2211058,0,t1_clk56bp,IMO. Taeyeon. Jessica. TiffanySeohyun. Sunny. SooyoungYuri. Hyoyeon. YoonaFirst  places are a no brainer. Next I paired Seohyun and Tiffany because I think Seohyun is more consistent and has better control than Tiffany but I personally like Tiffanys husky tone better and I feel like she gives songs more emotion. Sunny has a nice voice but its quite high and it fits some songs better than others. Yuri and Sooyoung are on par for me I can never decide who is better. Hyoyeon doesnt get much of a chance to sing and I think she doubts herself a bit because shes always called the dancing queen and her singing is usually disregarded. However from the few snippets Ive heard of her singing she actually sounds really good especially with the right songs and I have an inkling that she might actually be able to go a bit higher. Yoona like Hyoyeon also doubts herself and sings very quietly and weakly.

Im sorry you sound like you really are wanting to portray them in a negative light I cant take that serious.Try here ...and tell me how that isnt far more sexual than most other sexy concepts are. They are gyrating their god damn pussies into the air man come on! Tons of those dance moves are far beyond what you see in Kpop normally. It also has a significantly higher amount of dislikes. It was not well received. It certainly got them some attention and one could argue that bad publicity is still good publicity but it is definitely not fucking normal for what you see in Kpop.

2277594,0,t1_clsa86m,But that excuse doesnt really work because Wendy has lived in Canada where she presumably was exposed to a diverse group of people that included at least a few black people. Its not like shes a koreanborn and raised idol who has only been exposed to AAs in the media  and even then it still wouldnt be okay because a grown adult should have enough common sense to know not to base their opinions of an entire race of people off of a few movies or TV shows. This is racist because it perpetuates a negative stereotype of a race of people. Black women are sassy angry and arrogant. Black men are thuggish and confrontational. Negative stereotypes dont remain alive because of the people they affect they remain alive because there are people determined to keep them going to further oppress a group of people. We are doing something. We are having a discussion about what Wendy did and what it means. That is the first step towards change. Wendy is a public figure appearing on a public broadcast that people will listen to whats the difference between that and a movie or tv show that stereotypes black people? ,kpop,clt89ei,0,t5_2r1ox

2437663,0,t3_2ne5t0,Overall its pretty much what I expected as a follow up to NOM. Showtime is okay I think the chorus is probably the weakest part of the song. Shut U bangs and will probably get quite a bit of replay from me. Stupid Liar I think is really good and reminds me a bit of  On by Tinashe. NaDa is my favorite of the group so her solo doesnt bother me but I dont think its as good as Bang. Hug ME is surprisingly good since they seem to be a heavy party themed group. The club mix is forgettable dubbrostep but I dont mind it. At the end I prefer NOM but I actually like how they have a pretty specific sound as compared to the rest of the industry. Its funny how after their debut they seemed to be quite a joke to a lot of people but now it seems theyre being liked nonironically. The twerking is still bad though haha.,kpop,cmd01d9,3,t5_2r1ox

The total amount of her lines probably only makes up about one verse of a song and sometimes less.

So I did more research on SNSD and found songs that I did like which eventually got me more onto Kpop.If I wanted to show them cool choreography then probably EXOs growl...cuz most people can appreciate  people dancing in unison well and the songs straightforward.For actual musicproduction quality Id probably step more into YGs territory. But Id want to give them something a bit more serious than Catallena which I do love...but you kinda have to be in Kpop to really appreciate itIn the end it would really have to depend on the person.,kpop,co8fpc5,23,t5_2r1ox

Ive heard that most girl groups watch what they eat. Sohyun answered Weve graduated from controlling our diets two to three years ago. Now we have just learned to suck in our stomachs. You just have to suck it in for three minutes. gtChoi Hwa Jung followed up by asking Hyuna I hear you get angry when you havent eaten that you say lets eat something. Hyun replied Its true. I get angry when I dont eat as she laughed.gtIn addition to talking about eating and dieting DJ Choi Hwa Jung asked the girls What are you styles when it comes to love? HyunA answered I think that the push and pull is needed in moderation but I am mostly the type to get disappointed because I dont get to give as much love as Id like to. She added I think its because I love myself more still. gtSohyun replied The unnis tell me this that Im the bad girl style... I dont really like skinship I just push them away. Choi Hwa Jung joked But doesnt that make the guys leave? and Sohyun humorously replied Yes thats why they all left. She also revealed that she doesnt think she has found anyone yet that she has really felt strongly about.gtGayoon lamented I think my feelings have all dried up because I havent been in love for so long while Jihyun revealed I cant do the push and pull Im just the type who does everything i can for that person so Im not left with any regrets. I want to try my best. Jiyoon also said similarly I give my affection infinitely.gtMeanwhile minute recently made a powerful comeback with traphiphop title track Crazy and released their th minialbum of the same title.,kpop,conx3qa,19,t5_2r1ox

Also there wasnt very much distinction between the second verse and the chorus which really confused me because the first time I heard it I thought they had dragged the chorus out for like a minute and a half.

Their recent Korean stuff have been relatively underwhelming considering the focus is usually on TTS and songs in general have also been far from amazing.    On the other hand its going to be an interesting time having promos without Jessica. Theyll be able to handle it vocally if the lines are being spread to the other members and not just TTS. That was pretty evident from the Tokyo Dome concert. Choreography wont be an issue  Jessica hadnt really looked interested in them for quite some time up until she left  since theres no big loss in talent in that department.   What they need is a PaparazziFlower Power type of song so I could be more optimistic for their Korean stuff. Havent seen a bad Japanese single since... ever. ,kpop,cox9efd,40,t5_2r1ox

Anyway I would recommend contacting some of the dance groups that have gone before to perform. I think decent flash mobs always have a core of real dance troupe members and a lot of great dancers go to kcon.Getting the idea out there is great but if you want it to happen you need to plan out exactly what dances will be done and get training videos up then schedule at least one live practice session. I recommend a fb page ready for when the kcon announcements start happening. You could also contact the event coordinators after announcement and before schedules go up and see if you can make it an official event.Good luck I hope it happens. ,kpop,cp1xw11,6,t5_2r1ox

Sohyun has gotten into the music writing business as well Tickl in particular is a favorite of mine off of Crazy and Jiyoon wrote composed and arranged Stand Out which is pretty good considering shes never done that before.I dont know how often groups from the other agencies get to write their own things so Ive always enjoyed this aspect of Cube groups a cursory search of SNSD songs reveals that the girls have very little input in the process having contributed to about  songs total.Also TIL Brave Brothers made Ice Cream for HyunA no longer I dont like it p .,kpop,cq6wsqg,3,t5_2r1ox

3698608,0,t1_cqduvjn,I totally agree and would love to see this happening but what broadcasting station would go for this idea?  If it were KBS everything would be censored.  SBS would cater to YG acts more often than not and MBC would do the same to SM acts.  M! Countdown is on a cable network so their numbers wouldnt be great compared to the other three.  There would also be a lot of acts that would not be able to perform. Personally I think music shows are becoming archaic.  Most of the really popular present acts got popular due to a really catchy song that caught the publics attention sexy fancams extensive media play and variety show appearances.

Plastic surgery over there is more accepted so let it be accepted. Are you saying that if you dont like a trend in another country it should not happen?Whats wrong with it anyway? Some people dont like how they look and want to change themselves. Thats a normal human characteristic? And why are you hating on male kpop idols for not being manly? Are you saying that when males are born they are destined to live a burly life with no exception to doing anything girl related? You basically should just go on a rant about gays while youre at it.I found this post extremely offensive both to koreans and my asian race as well.,kpop,crc2m9m,7,t5_2r1ox

Theres only so many different chord progressions and melodies that can be made and this is different enough that itt not even remotely plagiarism. Have you heard some American music that got through? Listen to Kelly Clarksons Already Gone and Beyoncs Halo or Katy Perrys California Gurls and Kehas Tik Tok. The music industry has rules set for this that have strict laws and punishments if songs are copied its not like things can easily go through with no problem. People are not stupid and send things out that will bring lawsuits. Two songs sounding similar is bound to happen in music at some point I mean look at Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and the alphabet. Music has a lot of room for creativity but almost every song released nowadays will sound generally like another song its just because theres only so much room to make something new.TLDR Just because songs sound similar does not mean its plagiarism.,kpop,crrxuoc,11,t5_2r1ox

4399450,0,t1_csli6ny,Heres what I understood Minhyuk is poor and would rather break up with his gf then admit that he cant pay for all the stuff she wants.  She refuses and either tones down her spending or start supporting him instead. Years later theyre still together and hes rich and can now pay for stuff. Eunkwang works at a library probably a college library while studying but hes got a dickhead boss who doesnt give him time to actually study and use the resources of the library. There doesnt seem to be a climax to his story just that his boss starts giving him a break. Hyunsik is an aspiring artist with a harsh teacher. He takes out his frustration on the car guy and the teacher sees him. After this she starts giving him more positive reinforcement and he gets better. Im guessing the letter Sungjae receives at the beginning is a refusal letter from a college music degree probably he applied to. He tries to take his mind off this by eating like a pig and going backpacking. In the end hes inspired by Ilhoon and his girlfriend to not give up on music and try again. Or he tried to sell his song and he got refused but decided not to give up.Honestly the one I dont understand is Peniels storyline. Hes doing CPR on that crash victim but his senior pushes him away like he did something wrong but when she comes to visit them the senior points to Peniel as though hes the one who saved her.,kpop,csljwdj,10,t5_2r1ox

4518933,0,t3_3cydo4, I hate the way JYP artists sound in their songs. Their voices sound so short of breath and its as if the producer didnt process or correct the vocal enough. Im not sure if its down to vocal ability or song writing style but the syllables of each word sound so disjointed when theyre sung. Idk. SNSDs Korean albums B sides are often really bad. Theyve been off since their pre hits. Although I thought Mr Mr was OK not amazing.  I dont like it when groups get a free ride because of their company name. Like Red Velvet or iKon even EXO when they first started.  I really like the drama of scandals. Yuri cant sing. Daesungs tone isnt amazing. Yoseobs extreme high notes falsetto is grating.,kpop,ct096cr,19,t5_2r1ox

Everyone participating on a forum like this or others for kpop has someone or the other that they take a liking to and would try to support or see the better side of in any given situation...no one is exempt from this no matter how much they try to believe it. So long as any opinion is supported by some credible reason there is no reason why it should be downvoted or treated with an uppity attitude that is meant to devalue it with this ridiculous youre just saying oppa didnt mean it talk. Yeah there are moments when fans reach and try to overdo the defenses but this blanket statement serves no purpose other than being condescending. I think at least on reddit unlike other platforms we can try to engage on a standard above this.On topic  Glad for Zico. He didnt do anything wrong and it seems the investigation as well as his teams response was swift and clean in dealing with the issue.

4526333,0,t1_ct0x7ry,What a bunch of bulls diarrhea. I saw the post about the guy threatening Areia Creations. It was a complete setup by Hanys three friends in Melbourne all related to each other and tried to provoke Areia Creations when they said they are not related to Hanys activities in Australia. The company just replied saying to one of them that she is an illegal manager and she is damaging everything they have been doing with Hany. Then the other guy suddenly jumped with no reason saying omg thats so rude of your company I will post this everywhere in allkpop koreaboo etc. for everybody to know how bad your company is.You sound a lot like somebody close to Hany just trying to cover for her shortcomings because she is your friend. Probably one of those three. Well here it is the only thing I am still wondering about and I blame Areia Creations for is why on earth they have chosen an ugly fat girl from Australia with questionable skill and an attitude to unload all this money. They clearly have the ability to chose better artists and the have proved it with their other two artists. You got to be stupid to not get it I have checked Hany on everything she has done before she goes to Korea. In all her appearances and photo shoots she looks like a lost ugly loser that made her entry to the arts by questionable means and everybody really hated her since Neighbours. Then she had absolutely no luck for years except  seconds appearance in Wentworth. Go now and watch any of her old interviews. She cant even speak properly. Then suddenly Korea happened and Hany became a woman. Everything that Areia Creations has put out with her was gold. They transformed a beast into a queen. Now she is back in Australia and is using everything that Areia Creations has done for her to her advantage. I honestly believe Areia Creations should sue her and get their money back.,kpop,ct16k6i,-13,t5_2r1ox

All the members have said fx will always be five and at this point we see how SM is promoting the members more with solo activities than as a group. They know the group is likely to disband. Sullis already left to pursue acting full time though legally she is an inactive member of fx. Victoria has her own studio in China and is working a ton on various Chinese dramafilms Luna has her musicals but also have slowly made a Lunber subunit with Amber. Amber has a solo career What the Pineapple and Lunber subunit. Krystal is likely to follow Jessica to China.

4778841,1,t1_ctww6mb,SM does a lot of stupid things but ending Red Light promotions early wasnt one of them. You are comparing this incident to when Amber had an injury. These situations are vastly different. Amber didnt just randomly quit the bandgo on hiatus and there was an actual physical reason why she couldnt perform.This was in no way amicable and it wasnt a case of SM vs. the wishes of the group  Sulli.SM didnt leave Sulli out to dry. What the fuck are they supposed to do in the highly stylized and insincere world of Kpop when an idol actually gives them the finger? Address it publicly? People love to jump on SM immediately every controversy because they are known to do shitty things like force idols to perform with injuries in the past the infamous chair performances  but we later found out when Jessica was kicked from SNSD that SM tried everything to get the group to let her stay for another year at least but they werent having it.People do change hence why I said Sulli had her teenage phase after becoming a superstar. Comparing it to Sunmi and the Wonder Girls isnt a good thing either because that was handled professionally and amicably. That Sulli fangirl indeed comes off as a crackpot but I did take everything she said with a grain of salt. Also with how trigger happy SM seems to be at potentially suing slander cases  the only reason I can think of that they didnt go after her is that she has actual proof that could bring themSulli down. Claims like this are NOT IGNORED by major companies unless theres a shred of truth behind them.,kpop,ctwwx22,1,t5_2r1ox

However if you opt of active duty due to appeal of some disability or handicap its considered an easy copout because you arent out there serving among the ranks...which can be viewed as inadequate completion of responsibility and therefore that maybe you arent as manlytough as others who served as active duty soldiers.

4975629,0,t1_culgry2,Songwriters typically make more money than the artists who perform them. Esther Dean Kandi Burruss and Sia among others have all been extremely successful in western music due to this. Songwriters are very highly sought after because their talents are unique and their jobs arent easy so the good ones tend to do well financially. On top of that some perhaps many songwriters have no interest in the potential fame that comes with creating hit music while others might lack the charisma or some other quality that would allow for success as a performer. ,kpop,culpr4i,20,t5_2r1ox

So even then youre not making the full amount. Thats why they have to bust their asses off doing work when not doing group promotions.Thats why supposedly there was drama between Jessica and SM prior to her removal from SNSD since she was not using the SNSD name to promote BampE so SM couldnt get a cut of the companys revenue. In fact even prior to  there was no mention of her being a member of SNSD or SNSD at all.

5020451,0,t1_cur2owz,Right..  I never said cultural appropriation was okay nor am I encouraging it. When I say it stems from a higher place I meant that cultural appropriation is very reliant on the history which I explained without that awful history cultural appropriation wouldnt cause as much outrage as it does now. You seem to be misinterpreting what im saying yet repeating some points I already understand and stated.Personally I find that when white people do it it causes more outrage because of once again the history of oppression. How dare someone take something of your culture when not too long ago and unfortunately still going on today you were being enslaved and killed for it. Thats why there is so much outrage. I am not saying Asian and black people are in beautiful harmony and have never individually suffered racism from either party but there is no comparable racial history and tension against both of these groups of people. Rather they both share racial discrimination torture and violence from white people in the past. I am British Asian yes there is a lot of self hatred going in our community due to racism and generally not looking like everyone else and therefore perhaps leading onto being picked on leading to self hatred. BUT I am speaking about cultural appropriation within the Asian and Black community. White ideals started from colonialism and seeing whites as superior thats a whole different subject and I see why you would argue such thing if this was a white vs Asian cultural appropriation article but its not. Personally imitation comes from no where its not a racial created thing and I think youre looking to deep into that aspect. When you see something and you think its cool it will be copied right? Thats what I think Koreans all other Asian ethnicities are doing also. They see something and theyre like this is cool I want to get in on this. They dont see all that black people have to offer and the varieties of culture they have to offer its not all the same. But Koreans arent looking into that they are interested in the part of black culture that surrounds HIP HOP. They see these rappers with dreads gold chains gold teeth and different fashion styles and they love rap and thats all good and well but because they love rap they want everything about it and then thats when they want to get involved and therefore appropriate that black cultural aspect perhaps accidentally and damn they dont know what theyre doing is wrong they just think its stylish and its trendy right now HIP HOP is very popular these days. Im not saying its right I am saying that without history it is hard to put a staple on cultural appropriation and the line between flattery and indulging in a culture and appropriation you dig?,kpop,cur5mci,6,t5_2r1ox

5289801,0,t3_3ngbmb,I think the main contenders next week are Got Ailee iKON and Im Chang Jung. In terms of digital points Im Chang Jung has been totally dominating Melon this past week. Got has a slight advantage over the others though because If You Do has been out since Monday while iKONs songs except My Type and Ailees Mind Your Own Business have only been out since Thursday giving GOt extra days to rack up some digital points. Granted though iKon and Ailees songs have been doing much better than Gots on Melon since they came out.In terms of physical points if Im not mistaken iKONs physical album doesnt come out until October  giving Got a big advantage over them. Im going to go out on a limb and say that Got topped the physical charts last week.That all being taken into account Got will probably win The Show and have a good chance at Show Champion. I would also say MCountdown if iKON doesnt perform because otherwise there might be some weird broadcast point stuff going on to try to appease YG for complaining about iKONs nonnominations the last  weeks. Music Bank and Music Core will probably be a toss up between Got and Ailee. If I had to guess Got on Music Bank and Ailee on Music Core base on the songs that won this week. And Inkigayo will probably be a toss up between iKON and Im Chang Jung but probably going to iKON for their SNS and fan voting points.,kpop,cvnu1nb,5,t5_2r1ox

5351651,0,t1_cvvpclw,Let me preface by saying that I think the head touch is too far.  High fives even a small hug is in my opinion totally fine if the artist comes out off the stage of their own free will and especially if they initiate it.When I saw BA in Melbourne JinYoung came to the edge of the stage and squatted down holding out his hand for us to touch.  The three of us in that part of the front row were seated and at that stage werent allowed to stand up and were threatened with eviction if we did so after a quick glance at Security and their thumbsup we leaned forward to shake hands for a second and then sat back in our seats.  In the encore section they jumped into the crowd and ran up the back to take photos with random fans and gave hugs etc and them there was one particularly cool part where CNU was dancing in the front row area with the fans and fanboying Gongchans singing.Going off topic but the beauty of the front row in that concert was that there was security keeping rows  away and the first row fans kept at least a cm distance while they were down there so row  fans could pass up their phones and BA took selcas with them and gave them back.  That was really really amazing!  This stage with its whole standing only stuff couldnt accommodate such a setup meaning the fans lose their minds when they have the chance to get close.  We were hyped in the BA concert like SUPER hyped but by not allowing things to get so crazy it really helped them feel a safe enough to launch off into the crowd and b kept the fans who might be inclined to go crazy in check...those Security guards were a godsend for an amazing concert.  I cant say enough how much I loved their work!Having watched the clip in question this guy stands at the edge of the stage for a good  seconds before stepping off and out into the crowd.  If he didnt want to be touched he probably would have stayed back.  It was a calculated move and he did it intentionally so I think he was fine with random touching for a few seconds...the crowd already had their hands out and were going crazy and he still stepped out there.  Again though the head and hair grab is too much imho,kpop,cvvqf4a,10,t5_2r1ox

5415166,0,t3_3p2tam,Just got home. Wow that was fucking awesome. My seats werent the best but I didnt miss a thing thanks to the big screens and had a pretty good view of the whole set. I think the set list was the same pretty much except for that Bang Bang Bang extra encore it was so good. Taeyang got the whole crowd to do the big cheering intro to BBB gave me goosebumps. All the songs were awesome so much energy. If You was amazing as well such a beautiful song. The solo stages were probably the highlight excluding the intro and outros finaleencore.  Strong Baby was so fucking hype. Biggest gup confetti explosions crowd was going crazy I was at least I hadnt heard the song until recently but it seriously rocked. My favourite performance the studio version fucking pales in comparison to this godly show Seungri put on I cannot recommend it enough. Im listening to it at home now on mp but nothing will ever come close to his performance tonight I am honestly so impressed. Doom Dada was amazing as well its not my favourite T.O.P song but his rapping and the beat made it seriously impressive the atmosphere was amazing.  Looked like a goddamn riot broke out in the GAVIP section whenever anyone threw an item of clothing in I saw a towel and hat and jacket go in.  I really love how much talking and interacting they did with the crowd Seungri was fantastic especially great English and lots of fun. A whole lot of funfunny English from T.O.P Taeyang and Daesung GD was pretty flawless. The whole crowd went apeshit whenever T.O.P started to talk.  Fantastic Baby finale was so loud and energetic and intense and just everything Im so sad its done. I know they wont be back for years if ever but I know I will have to see them whenif they do come back. Im in the middle of HSC but it was so so worth it to go Im so glad I did. Thankfully my schedule allowed me to do so. Hope everyone else had as much fun as I did!EDIT Daesung did his I can hear you but I cant see you! Do you want to see my eyes? then the crowd goes wild as he uncovers his eyes Seungri talks about him needing plastic surgery or something.  Seungri Daesung and T.O.P all danced to Sexy Back T.O.P giving a lot of ass to the crowd. He even asked taking a lesson from Daesung Do you want to see my ... ass!? then shakes his ass around. Seungri tried to sing along repeatedly but kept claiming That song is just not my chord sorry Justin. Not a load of swearing from Seungri but he did open Strong Baby with Make some fucking noise! which was fantastic absolutely loved his performance.  Daesungs drum solo leading into Sober was fantastic super talented! GD intros Fantastic Baby finale with Tonight! Fantastic motherfucking baby! it was such a great performance from all of them so much fun.  All the songs that didnt like as much beforehand were the best ones to perform in concert Strong Baby Doom Dada BBB. Beat heavy dancy rapping super loud bass it just created such an atmosphere everyone was on their feet for Fantastic Baby it was so goddamn loud and amazing.

5451931,0,t1_cw8j000,We can agree to disagree I guess.While yes she wasnt forced out in the traditional sense it was still more than likely the continual knetz hate and their thirst for drama surrounding her personal life played a big role in her premature exit from the group and her not waiting until their contracts expired to do so. Thus to me Sulli was still in a sense forced out because her withdrawl seemed more as a result of getting away from the drama and hate being continually thrown at her rather than simply leaving to pursue an acting career  at least thats my take on the situation.Remember that Luna had said an f comeback was happening a few months prior to Sullis official withdrawl  so Sulli initially planned to be a part of this most recent comeback. ,kpop,cw8jbhy,-6,t5_2r1ox

5686342,0,t1_cx1x68v,Jiyoon is hilarious. Her Yubin and Hyolyn are funny without even trying just being themselves. Ehh its never too late for me. Whats important is that in the end I wanted to listen to two of her songs again Naega Naega hae and This Aint Me... I didnt really care who won the format is kind of weird anyways to determine and overall winner especially something as completely subjective as music. I fucking LOVED her semifinal. It wasnt an amazing rap performance but as a whole I loved the song. I just wanted to hear good music really... Basick was good. Her singing was good and she did do two verses. Drink drink I wont be downloading but kind of catchy its whatever. The team battle she did with Kasper I liked a lot... the one that had Zico vibing out. Big fan of singing mixed into hiphop beats. HAHA fucking puss. I LOVED IT ............... Ive been looking for an uncut uncensored live version that doesnt lag but no luck. I dont know enough about kpopculturefemale rappers to have people I want on... I only checked it out cause Yubin was on ha.. and I love hiphop and korean hip hop. Returning people that didnt get much of a chance for tracks definitely EXY. Checked out some Choi Sam Im down for her to be on. I know Ailee can rap. Maybe some Gilme OG unnie redemption if she isnt too stressed allegedly? Im sure theyll find more contestants for an interesting season... It might not be saying much but its literal the best reality show Ive ever watched and I use to watch all that American shit So You Think You Can Dance Americas Got Talent Hells Kitchen American Idol Celebrity Apprentice lol Can you explain the sales for UNpretty rapstar being more than UPRS? Is it simply cause those songs have been out longer or the public just like them more. But the peak chart positions none of season  even cracked top . ,kpop,cx1y28v,1,t5_2r1ox

I actually preferred Female President...gtThese days I think Eunjung is pretty good actually.Shes always been ok but the gap between her and Soyeon is big. Hyomin and Jiyeon are decent also.gtThe  years where they only got Brave Brothers worst songs prevents me from rating them too highly.Whats Your Name was ok and really catchy but Ill never understand how it did so much better than Volume Up which was amazing.

5868072,0,t3_3vja3c,Ive listened to a lot of albums and these are the only ones that I can honestly listen to all the way through without skipping any of the tracks because they all blend into each other well and are just overall excellentBA  In The Wind Ah my neglected princes! I hate that their international fandom is so tiny because people are seriously missing out on some great music from them.Super Junior  Sorry Sorry I know they have a bad rep especially among newer kpop fans but this album is incredible. Im not a ballad person at all yet the ones on this album are great. Its  years old yet songs like Its You and She Wants It still sound fresh as hell to me.Shinee  Romeo Shinee is a damn popular group yet I see nobody ever talk about how cohesive this album is? All six of the songs on this album are fabulous I cant pick a favorite...TVXQ  Spellbound The album that turned me into a stan...It sucks that nobodys really checking for them anymore because this album is their first as a duo that I can really listen to all the way through. I dont find it as...tryhard? as some of their past attempts  ie. the crazy electrodubstepness of Catch Me Humanoids etc  the whole vibe of this album is very comfortable and I feel like theyve finally figured what kind of sound works best for them. It just leaves me speechless every time I sit down and listen to it. If you listen to one album on this list please let it be this one.Big Bang  Remember Choosing between this and Stand Up was very difficult but Sunset Glow is...god...so wonderful. The acoustic Haru Haru makes my heart hurt.fx  Pink Tape This one sort of goes without saying at this point? The production is great  the instrumentals are fabulous and some of the most creative Ive ever heard period. Every single one of the songs seem to flow into each other which I dont really find in Red Light although that has some good songs as well. Their Electric Shock mini is also very solid.GDampTOP  GDampTOP If youre looking for an album full of bops this is for you. I used to be a huge Big Bang fan overall but honestly...I think this is the best album that ever came out of the group period. Seungris VVIP would also be up there but this album is just timeless. I think T.O.P and GDs dynamic is great imo they compliment each other a lot better than GDTaeyang because I feel like T.O.P adds a specific kind of polish to GDs usual craziness that you cant necessarily find in his collab with Taeyang.BoA  BoA America wasnt ready for this slayage. This is a perfect pop album in my opinion.Zion.T  Mirrorball Simply put these four songs are all just magical.Dynamic Duo  LUCKYNUMBERS Ive scrolled through the replies here and Ive seen some people mention their newest album but I have to disagree. This album is their best. It doesnt even sound like an album to me the transitions between songs are especially seamless. I think the arrangements really help elevate this album to something really special.,kpop,cxou2pt,2,t5_2r1ox

Seems like artists who have been around for awhile are seizing more control of the creative aspect of their music and management teams are giving more freedom of control to newer groups.

6088647,0,t1_cyhl2lg,gt People always talk about the YG elitism and I cant see it. Of course Im a YG fan....Its hard to explain tbh. Its just a vibe I guess. I get it mostly from Big Bang and with IKON I definitely feel it. Im not even trying to dislike them Its just something with their stage presence and how they hold themselves. Plus when I watch their shows and variety I still feel it. IDK I just feel uncomfortable watching them sometimes but thats just me. gtThis is very small if not nonexistent. There are a few people here and there and they argue that Chanwoo should not be in the group.......I feel like that part of my comment was more from my personal experience with IKON fans that I know of. The KPOP scene at my university is pretty huge and in my club a lot of people split up into those little subgroups that I had mentioned and from what Ive seen from some netizen behavior online its similar. It was just my assumption. I actually did not know that Chanwoo was voted onto IKON so that shows my ignorance because I dont follow IKON at all tbh so I guess he must be somewhat popular at least in Korea if anything. I am guilty however of only caring about IKON because of certain members Jinwhan and Junhoe. But I feel like thats just kpop fans in general. gtHis main message is about how other idol rappers have ruined the name of idol rapper....I totally get that tbh from his lyrics and what not but its just the vibe he puts off when he releases these things sounding like hes aggressive and what not when he just debuted. Its one of the main reasons especially in the Korean pop industry where they hate on because hes a new addition and has just officially debuted and he didnt show respect to his seniors in the industry so that turned a lot of people off. I actually kinda liked his diss and Ravis disses because free music is good for all of us lolLike I said Im not an IKON hater at all I really do like their music. RHythm Ta is infectious and My Type is such a perfect chill song. Its just that I cant bias them for personal reasons and thats just me doing me. ,kpop,cyhp734,2,t5_2r1ox

But we had a kpop group and a kpop dance group with lots of multicultural merging with islanders Africans and Russians joining in.

Tzuyu even has the most on her resume now and most twice articles about one member are about her. Also in her cf even jungyeon and nayeon were behind her. That says a lot.

6249612,0,t1_cyzn8th,Disclaimer mainland Chinese in US.It is the shamehate education that put this into play. The narrative of the whole middle school history education is intentionally webbed in a way in which China with a glorious past that the whole world envoys had suffered greatly starting from th century to the first half of the th century from warsinvasions and whole country was broken and divided until Communist party united it once again and through all those years efforts under their leadership China has become prosperous than ever....This way of teachings are inherently racist but in a quite unique way that it makes you feel inferior to other nationsraces because we were that poor and weak once and bullied by all. This feeling of inferiorism makes people in turn fragile and super protective of their identity and actively want to regain the pride supposedly taken from them a.k.a nationalism.

She is often regarded as the cute one and is known amongst fans for making  spring rolls for JYP during a challenge to prove their star quality.    Mina  lead dancer vocalist and japanese.  She did ballet for  years and along with Momo were huge kpop fans before they left Japan to train in Korea.  Dahyun  lead rapper she was scouted for JYP after a viral video of her doing the eagle dance now the Twice members do this dance often on shows.

6656102,0,t1_d07qkf2,I was actually just thinking about this earlier before seeing this thread. SHINee is known for being very hardworking and always giving  but it is not without detriment. The members can be incredibly hard on themselves. People like to poke fun at Minhos competitiveness but its actually a very real issue for him he feels an insane amount of pressure and gets deeply upset when he loses. Hes very aware that some of his natural talents arent on par with his members and therefore cant seem to ever go easy on himself. Its not cute when your bias says they cant sleep at night when they lose the insecurity can be heartbreaking. The same goes for the other members. Key can be quite the perfectionist Jonghyun seems to let his sensitivity consume him sometimes etc. Theres also a high amount of outside pressure because people tend to expect nearflawlessness from them and its pretty impossible to always deliver its lovely how they continue the trend but the expectations only get higher as they go along. And with all that they still get floored when they get recognition. Im really not trying to say this in a gushy oh theyre so perfect kind of way and I know the pressure applies to a lot of groups its just actually pretty sad sometimes. ,kpop,d07srje,45,t5_2r1ox

Yeeun has a slight bowlegged so rd from the right would be her.

Once they finish promoting that one single they finish promotions and dont release another single from the album. In America when someone releases an album they promote singles from it one by one for an extended period of time sometimes years. Take Taylor Swift for example. She released her album  in October  and shes still promoting singles from it. I wish Kpop did this. Make an album last as long as possible.

6799119,0,t1_d0lnja4,gt There is no guarantee that the current top  will stay top The reason for this statement is because the current top  members has alot of freecarrier votes.For example those who are cheering for kim sejeong might have also voted for the other jellyfish girls and kim sohye due to sohye making sejeong more angelic on screen.  Those who are cheering for sohye might have give sejeong free votes as well due to sohye getting help from sejeong.  Dont forget there is also alot of kang mina supporters as well.Because those four fandoms are supporting each other this creates a huge imbalanced in the voting system.With the multiple voting system gone a few of the top  trainees will take a huge hit due to the fact that they lost the carrier votes and support from other fandoms.  And YES MNET just turn them against each other.  They are fighting each other for top  now.gtnote this is just a speculation.Produce  top  is debuting on April  .  The  round is probably the last elimination round.  It is not a surprised that MNET is making this a personal battleground for fandoms. IT is MNET AFTERALL.  Dont get me wrong I am not supporting this idea.  Like you I think it is completely stupid idea and hate MNET for it.

I agree with your post but unfortunately you cant stop people from commenting the way they want to. Its unfortunate and I wish arguments would happen less but its just completely unstoppable especially for something like this where people are so invested they feel the need to have to get involved and say something. They have a right to their opinion and a right to voice it so I just ignore it if it bothers me. The hostile comments usually end up getting down voted to the point theyre not even visible anymore and get buried under everything else. But if its bothering you that much and you notice its the same people have you brought it to the attention of the mods?

Allow for people to make complaints to moderators and if there arent enough moderators to enforce this perhaps add some more who are willing to take on the workload assuming toxic behaviour is that widespread of an issue.Im a casual observer of this subreddit so I havent really seen too much toxicity but if my first visit here had me reading a name and shame thread I would likely not find it very welcoming.,kpop,d1bddls,3,t5_2r1ox

But I loved them individually and often watched variety that had their members in it because I thought they were all so enjoyable and fun. Then they released View which I really liked which surprised me and then I slowly started to venture into their btracks discovering many many many good songs.

If you have general admission and the venue hasnt sold out a  hours before GA doors open should be fine. I know some other GA ticket holders in other cities with smaller turnoutvenues got randomly closer to stage if they werent strictly sectioned off. If all else  hours before the recommended time for your type of ticket should be okay. If you plan to buy merchandise buy online and choose pickup at venue instead for cheaper prices. Posters might be delayed since it was for LA.Also I think the security  or Siva Group seems to let Korean girls off easy if they do something wrong. First there was  NYC fight where a drunk Korean girl started assault black girls just to get near the front and only kicked out the black girl. And then in LA drunkass Korean girls smoking inside the venue and pushing their way to the front and security didnt do shit .

7271351,0,t3_4ez3dc,OH MAN. I. LOVE. MAMAMOO. Its probably a given if you have seen me comment around here... How do I start.. I was about to give up on kpop  ish a lot happening in that year both personal and in kpop when I saw some comments where people were recommending Mamamoo. I heard that name before watched their debut mv and didnt pay much attention to them because I was busy irl so I was curious as to why are people talking about them. Ultimately I checked out one of their perfomances for Piano Man since they were promoting that at the time. AND I FELL IN LOVE SO FAST YOU DONT EVEN KNOW ahem Anyways I got hooked in one performance ! and started looking for all their other stuff including the previously ignored debut mini album and prerelease.  Ill be honest I dont really care about any other kpop acts now. I do listen to their releases but thats usually it...My favorite title song is still Piano Man UOAY is a close second. I love their live performances but I love them as humans even more.  They are super loud especially when they bully their leader Image? Whats that? Maknae line is very cute. BFF goals Perverts Did I mention they are loud?I could go on forever but rather than stating my opinions its better if you form your own.Some songs you might have missed Hwasa solo  My heart from their debut mini Mamamoo  Gentleman with eSNA Mamamoo  My Everything Spy OST Mamamoo  Love Lane Marriage Not Dating OST Very emotional song for us moomoosSome featurings you might have missed Primary  Mileage ft.

7280777,0,t3_4f3t49,YG has a very good business acumen see profits so I would automatically rehire him and let YG follow his general vision. However what I would changePromotions  Frequency and Variety Shows The obvious one here. I understand that all the groups cant be constantly promoting because they take a while to write songs but I would make sure that when they are in a compositional rut they can promote songs by the inhouse producers if they wish who are great. Its too late for WINNERiKON but for newer boy or girl groups that have the potential to be selfcomposed I would start them off with a majority of inhouse produced songs and have the composing members collaborate and work on some of the songs with those producers to get their feet wet. In my opinion thats the best way to let these artists grow AND have them promote frequently enough. When they debut focus on inhouse produced songs and then as they grow after a year or two shift toward their selfcomposed songs which then allows the inhouse producers to focus on other new groups.There would never be more than  weeks without any YG promotions. Plenty of the members would be great in variety as well see Seunghoon and while all the JTBC programming Sugarman Mari and Me HalfMoon Friends is definitely a step in the right direction I would work to establish a variety presence for some of the members. Sure they may not be as charismatic as Jackson but they are definitely likable enough to earn some fans and work on some shows. Will edit if I think of anything else.EDITSome other random stuff Id do Promote the new YG rappers as a unit. Maybe even throw One in there for a member rap group.  Power vocal group Lee Hi  Katie Kim  Jang Hana  ? Never debut a group with more than  members. The talk of a  member girl group scares me. Speaking of the girl group I would have a survival show for them where GDragon has the most influence in picking the members... and then have GD as their main composer. Basically function like Teddy does for NE.  Something like SM Station or the JYP Duo releases would be nice. ,kpop,d25rxub,28,t5_2r1ox

Theyre all talented and worked hard but were pushed into a corner where they didnt want to be or really belonged. I remember one of the members stating that they didnt really want to stick to the sexy concept but that was the only option left on the table. People also critized them for asking their fans for money to further their careers but thats how desperate some of these groups are mostly if you dont belong in a big company. Ive been saying this for a while but as larger companies grow every larger were going to see more and more of this. Some can argue that Kpop is alive and well because so many groups are coming up and there are so many trainees. In reality only about  of them make it and only the large companies are making money. I can imagine Kpop  years from now. Its going to be ruled by  large companies and the number of debuting groups is going to be cut in half because no one can afford it no more. ,kpop,d2h3wu6,4,t5_2r1ox

7473568,0,t3_4hnrqe,Oh man to say Ive been anticipating this comeback would be an understatement.  AKMU was my first real bias group and I love these ridiculously talented kids so much.  With this album I like that they are taking more risks and trying new sounds.  REBYE  Slinky and jazzy.  I love the more mature sound both in Soohyuns vocal technique and Chanhyuks composition.  I like that you can hear different genres influencing the overall sound of the track.  How People Move  This song is benefited greatly from the music video which is adorable.  I love how fun and upbeat this is but not my favorite.  I prefer their upbeat tracks from Play.  .Haughty Girl  This sounds like their first album.  The guitar shines here and I appreciate that the vocals are more chill.  I like the lyrics.  While the first  songs sound like experiments this sounds like what I would expect.  .Green Window  OH man this is great.  Beautiful vocals great instrumentation just really nice and uplifting.  I like the lyrics too.  Just a great song all around.  .Every Little Thing  I can see this being part of a musical.  It has that big band feel with the brass and strings.  I can just picture the cutest little dance routine with like full skirts and character shoes.  It greatly appeals to my musical theater lifestyle.  Around The chorus in this is fantastic!  The harmonies are lovely.  The slower rap and lilting beat really give this a wistful feel very nice.   Overall I really like this album even though it wasnt what I was expecting.  This has a much bigger and experimental sound that what I was expecting which was more acoustic and coffee house.  I think I like the title tracks least lol.  .  Very good.,kpop,d2rp828,4,t5_2r1ox

Work has been pretty good this week I just got over a shitty cold from last week so being healthy is awesome however Cheer Up really got me through the cold because I adored the music video and played the song probably  times by the rd day it was out. Im getting back into Kpop because I had some friends who were DIEHARD livers of the genre and many different groups back in high school. So far Im still in love with BIGBANG and Ive found a new love in MAMAMOO EXID AOA Twice and EXO. Im still finding moreopen to new stuff as well.   Mamamoo and Twice are my two favorite groups for sure though now.    I bought my first kpop album this past weekend and was blown away by all the cool shit you get. I got Twices page two album and I loved everything I got in it. I even got my bias Tzuyu as the secret card. fan boy squeal of joy. My girlfriends bias is Sana and I love that she is really dogging Kpop too. I like checking this sub its pretty cool. Also lastly I watched the I. O.

7596173,0,t1_d35lks0,I dont think theyre scared of him much anymore. At debut definitely because he was kind of super serious but now hes a lot softer. The most recent GOTing is a good example since it was a hidden camera prank on Yugyeom and JB said he couldnt get too angry or theyd know he was faking it.Junior is better as support in my opinion. While JB has been injured Mark has been leading the introoutro at their shows and theres a lovely video of Mark glancing at Junior a few times and Junior silently encouraging him.

7600084,0,t1_d362epq,For Key I was imagining more of a longterm situation where he would have to be the leader. When it comes to taking charge and helping other members I feel like any of the boys could do that given the situation. Even Taemin whom nobody has mentioned to my amusement could do it at this point. They each have different strengths that apply in different situations after all. But as for carrying a pretty much careerspanning title of leader and the official and unofficial responsibilities that come with it its incredibly difficult for me to visualize anyone other than Onew being a suitable fit.I disagree about Jonghyun possibly being a good leader but I think youre completely right about Onew having a hand in their current group dynamics. Mentioning Jaewons take on SHINees group dynamics is funny because Im pretty sure at least some of the reason the members are prone to selfregulation and mediation without breeding contempt amongst themselves is because of Onews lead from the middle technique. SHINee has an exemplary group dynamic and a lot of that is because of Onew.Basically all roads lead to Lee Jinki lol.,kpop,d363as1,10,t5_2r1ox

7601147,0,t1_d353b2a,Yea big difference between Sulli and Minzy unfortunately. Part of the reason Sulli left was because she would get called useless so much by Knetizens etc. She didnt have a huge role in the group other than visual but they have Krystal for that anyway with a more successful acting career.

7615236,1,t1_d37pbq6,Are people here really saying that they would care about Jessica if she wasnt a past member of SNSD? Lets not be delusion now. Yes shes worked for whats shes got but lets not like act if she was a never apart of SNSD we would care about her song. Do you also think the Chinese fans would give a shit about Kris Luhan or Tao if they werent apart of Exo? Same goes for most people in Kpop groups. Im not hating on anyone Im just pointing out the obvious which of some season people here cant see. If Jessica and Tiffany were brand new unsigned artist no one has never heard of and they released these same songsMVs no one would care. Again not hating on anyone just pointing out the facts. A huge part of Jessicas music success if due to her fame from SNSD lets not pretend like it isnt. And agsin Im not saying she didnt work for what she has or she only has SNSD to thank for her success but there are plenty of talented artists out there that have better voices and work harder than Jessica but why arent they as successful has her? Because they were put in the same position as her being apart of the biggest female Kpop group. What you guys are saying is the equivalent of saying Donald Trump would still be a billionaire even without his fathers money. Im saying Donald Trump worked to be a Billionaire but without his fathers money he would have never come close to it. You guys are acting like Jessica would have still been successful in her solo career if she was never apart of SNSD. Im saying she has worked for everything shes got but being a past member of SNSD is a huge part of why shes so successful. Same goes for all people part of popular groupsbands everywhere not just Kpop. Zayn from One Direction is another example. I think Pillowtalk is a really good song but if he wasnt a past member of One Direction no one would have given a shit about him or his songs. I dont even like One Directions songs but the only reason I heard his song was because so many people where talking about how its the first song from the member that left the group.Would anyone care about the members of Exo if they werent in Exo? Would the Chinese fans care what Kris Luhan or Tao does if they werent past member of Exo? Nope. SM could have easily pick other people when they formed Exo and the fans wouldve like them just as much. Just make sure theyre good looking good dancers and decent singers. Its not like theyre exceptional singers or dancers. That not only goes for Exo but most members of popular Kpop groups with the exception of true singers like Taeyeon or Hyorin. Yes Exo and all Kpop groups work their asses off but lets not act like any of us would care about their songs or what they did if they wrent in the groups that theyre in. My point is its pretty naive to think Jessica would be nearly has successful has she is if she wasnt a past member of SNSD. Lets be honest here Jessica wouldnt have a fan base to support her if it wasnt for SNSD because no one would know who she was. A bit harsh but we all know its true. Again same goes for the Exo members who left.,kpop,d37t9ii,6,t5_2r1ox

I know there is a girl called D.ana? or something but I dont recognize her either and I dont know anyones role. Lets try!From left to right...The first one seems to be the sub rapperThe second one is the maknae I guess? and maybe shes part of the rap line too as she does a lot of talk partsThe rd one is the st lead vocalist as she sings in all the chorus and gets parts on the verses too she may be the center tooThe th is obviously the main rapper seems the main dancer too as she is in the center here and in the chorus too also seems the oldest or nd oldest and may be the leader and center tooThe th one seems to be the visual as she has a very innocent and Korean type of beauty she may be the maknae too but I think shes the nd youngest also I guess shes on the dance line since she sings very few linesThe th one is obviously the main vocal btw her vocals are really stable and good! she seems one of the oldest and could be the leader too.

In the couple of years since I got into kpop Ive never spent money on it only watched videos and listened to stuff on Spotify but I bought her mini album on itunes when it came out and just bought the physical today after realizing how few copies were sold.  Shes not my bias but she is the kind of artist I want to support the most.At the end of the day I hope that shes doing okay.

Perhaps make it a light pink or pastel colour instead? The changing headers look pretty cool but as a lot of people commented already it seems a bit too big along with the rest of the stylesheet. Everything is much more spaced out now which means we have to scroll up and down a lot more! Like many other commenters I also wish the header images were more noticeably from Kpop.I really like the pinned topics menu though! Itll be really handy.

Of course Ladies Code was the most painful moment but since I was following SNSD through a period of my life I was really depressed I took Jessica being left out really badly too. It helps that the last generation of girls groups Im counting from Mamamoo to IOI is so satisfying. Im really excited to see them grow but not as invested in one or two of them as I used to.Kpop is so much more than just music I know Im following it also for all the variety and the marketing of a friendship even if I know that its just business behind Im not ashamed as I was before when something kpoprelated affects me.,kpop,d4hqj8n,10,t5_2r1ox

Xiumin does strain yes but he has more overall development of his range and has better breath control by a lot. Same with Suho.

8249997,1,t3_4sey57,Negatively When I heard that Taeyeon said that Alicia Keys was pretty for a black girl sauce that made me like her less. I still jam to Why and I but have a lot less respect for her as a person. Looking back onto GDragons solo career there have been instances of cultural appropriation that make me like him less. I still appreciate him as a producer and a lyricist and worship Big Bang but I cant support his solo career.Positively Learning of the very humble beginnings and sad story of Jonghyuns childhood made me appreciate his talent on a deeper level. I grew to love his solo stuff and explored more of SHINees discography because of it. I was aware of SHINee but never really gave them a chance until I learned how involved Jonghyun is with his music. I already loved BTS but to learn that they are open to and supportive of the LBGT community made me love them more.,kpop,d58t0pl,13,t5_2r1ox

8380285,0,t3_4udybp,Im mainly a reddit lurker but I figured this video hit close to home and I wanted to share my opinion on this. nd year film student here btw nothing fancy.First of all big ups to uGiovanniToneto for making the video I bookmarked it and sent it to my lecturer because he starts every lecture with making the statement that . Film making is effort effort and effort. And . Film is knowing what to show and what not. That being said aspect ratios help a lot with the latter.When I first started getting into filming and storywriting I often watched classics like The Godfather Kill Bill Citizen Kane Vertigo ... to get inspired for a film project. These are all great movies and a must see for people that have not yet watched these. But after getting introduced in the Korean game show Running man and with its Idol guests I got into kpop. To be honest at first I didnt like it at all. It was too bright fast and all over the place. There was always something happening and I often found myself focusing on non important parts of the video. You know how you can look at something and when its over you cant remember anything youve just seen... Thats what happened to me could be just me though.... But after a while when classes started to get more technical and as I got to know more and more of the rules in filmmaking and camerawork I noticed that a lot showed in those same kpop mvs. Camera framing DOF focus color correction ... All of these things were all thought of when making the clips and even better how they could be different from other videos so they can stand out.For example in Ladies code  Pretty Pretty they really do play with the Isometric perspective something Ive never seen before in a MV. The creative thought process around the concept of that video in my eyes is an amazing achievement. Big ups to the company for that one.In EXIDs  UPampDOWN and many other kpop videos you see that the cropmarks are either another color or a texture that supports or brings out the image in the middle of the screen. Through out the entire video the fur textures get used in a range of colors which makes the entire thing just fit well. Once again big ups to the original creators for having such creative thoughts.What I also noticed in kpop is that you can do a lot with very little. Simple set mvs like Lim Kims AWOO that has a bit of a slower song pace fits the song perfectly yet the bright colors completely absorb all your attention so you focus  and see every little thing that happens in the MV. Another thing I wanted to mention is that Korean mv creators are amazing at pushing a certain style throughout a video. One that many starting filmmakers as myself can learn a lot from. Just a few videos that I thought have a great style and set design and overal just a really flippin great  Spica  You dont love me... THE SOLUTIONS  nd LP MOVEMENTS... FIESTAR  One More... All the Orange Caramel MVs... ZION T  EAT and YANGHWA BRDGLong story short.

8523015,0,t1_d66rvfv,Thanks for these  The abstracts were great since each study was like  pages long. My comment was more related to the education portion which I dont agree with as it pertains to Korea and not that you were implying sexual abuse doesnt happen in big companies. After you clarifying I just wanted to share my opinion how the studys rationale about education is less likely to apply to Korea.The idea of big and small companies having different level of educations doesnt fully apply to Korea because Korea has the highest  of college degree holders in the world. Its unlikely that employees at any company even companies started by someone without a college degree to have employees that do not have a bachelors degree minimum. Anecdotally speaking  of the people i know working at companies in Korea has a college degree. Filtering a bit of those I know at music companies excluding artists but many do have college degrees there are a few people who do hold higher degrees relevant in entertainmentmusicbusiness   person is in the big  music company and the others work small companies or law firms for IP. Now of course people I know isnt exactly statistically sound but it is consistent with being the top degree holding country in the world. You might have pasted a wrong study link about the level of education and sexual abuse because that one looks at the association of child sexual abuse and later parenting traits and maternal anger issues. Your analogy is not wrong but to make it consistent with Koreas situation both kids would come from comparable income families. If both kids came from comparable income families we cannot use that as a point of meaningful correlation about who can enter university. Since Im saying both big and small music companies have comparable levels of education in Korea I just think those studies cant be used as a point of correlation about sexual abuse.

8576647,0,t1_d6djogi,Dude same. Ive also only been a fan since Lionheart but snsd have so many iconic moments that I wish I could have been there for. People always talk about how their magic has diminished and theyre at the end of their time and I cant help feeling so frustrated because I feel like Im only still at the beginning of it all. Sometimes its cool because theres just so much compiled and great content to get through and it really feels like youll never run out still only half way through snsd and the dangerous boys. But other times its kinda depressing to remember that although theyve been my favourite group for a year now  Im still yet to experience a group comeback let alone a SJJD one. Its why I was extra excited for Sailing  bcos it was the first bit of new group content Id finally be able to experience. But I always have to remind myself at least I was lucky enough to be a fan before they had solo debuts or before their th year anniversary and that at least I made it to be a fan before their group activities completely come to a halt.

8634003,0,t3_4y45pg,Thats kind of a hard question to ask because youre bound to get varied answers. Here are mine in case anyones curious. Mamamoo when they are singing ballads. Their skill at harmonizing is simply unparalleled in Kpop and when Solar and Wheein are smoothly belting emotional high notes it just tugs at my heart. When I saw them sing Backwoods in Immortal Songs I cried in my first two watches and for the next two watches I got teary eyed simply because it was just so damn beautiful.. Ailee is so good at bringing out the emotion in a ballad especially because of her phrasing and stylistic choices. This is my favorite Ailee ballad.. Kyuhyuns and Onews voices are similar in tone both possessing a really soft light and soothing qualities rare in kpop contrasting with aggressive husky voices pretty boy airy nasal middle notes and incredibly nasal belted high notes. Their mixed chesthead voices especially Kyuhyuns are welldeveloped relaxed nonnasal and stable which makes their high notes sound very pleasant to the ears and always makes me want to sing along with them. Onews parts in Life compared to Jonghyuns parts are just so damn beautiful just because of his voice and Kyuhyuns songs are always amazing like this one which is my favorite OST song from him.,kpop,d6kuvuz,34,t5_2r1ox

I havent watched the show but based only on the information you gave in your comment I wouldnt necessarily criticize that or consider that a bad thing.

8727452,1,t3_4zk8x4,i mean this isnt ideal especially for international fans but i think it makes complete sense. promoting on music shows is hard time consuming risky from a health perspective how many idols have fainted or sprained something on a music show. is it really worth it for a group thats already blown up? they dont need the extra exposure they arent struggling to sell singles and now their time is free for album recordingartistic development whatever.i see a lot of comments that can be summed up as they are rookies they should have to pay their dues and that makes no sense from either a business or a common sense standpoint. that boils down to pointless hazing and benefits no one. im honestly shocked thats its normal in korea to perform the same song with the same choreo with a different outfit on a different day for weeks on end and i cant blame YG for saying lol ok but were already famous and youre already buying our albums so fuck thatstop being so entitled.,kpop,d6wkou8,1,t5_2r1ox

8736007,0,t3_4znj0k,Ahhh. The Chinese ban on Korean artists was pretty much confirmed this morning. Allow me to rant. As someone who is Chinese Im so conflicted about this whole thing. On one hand Im just like the rest of you guys of course it sucks that my favourite idols can no longer perform in China or appear on TV shows that I enjoy. It sucks a lot that the Chinese fans will no longer be able to see their stars on movies and TV shows. I stan UNIQ and was heartbroken when it was revealed at the height of the announcement that Sunjoos appearance in a Chinese drama was cancelled and he was replaced. It really really sucks. On the other hand I can see where the Chinese are coming from in this decision. In the recent  years the Chinese entertainment market has been FLOODED with Korean artists trying to make their way in. Its totally understandable why the general public has not been pleased about this. From a nonkpop fans perspective it sucks when you turn on your TV expecting to watch something Chinese that the Actors mouth shape doesnt match what hes saying at all because he recorded it in a different language. It sucks when you want to watch variety or a talk show half the guests they invite on cant communicate with the MC without a long pause in translation. All these Asian countries are insanely nationalistic we all know thatTiffany. If you understand Chinese youll know that whenever a Korean star goes on a mainstream Chinese show half the comments underneath are oppa! and the other half is super racist calling the Korean to go home. Remember recently when there was all that controversy about Chinese shows blurring out Korean actors faces it got so much flak here on reddit but in China all the shows which ARENT blurring out faces are being called out as nonnationalistic and boycotted. Its been said that this was a retaliation against THADD  but I think the government has just been looking for an excuse to put it into effect. To the Chinese this ruling isnt an attack on Korea because of recent political tensions. Its just a simple protective economic strategy if you limit the imported product the domestic market will do better. In conclusion I just wanted you guys to kind of see the other side of the story and I still dont know how I feel about all this! aaaarughghgh ,kpop,d6xndaa,29,t5_2r1ox

8744335,1,t3_4ztfxn,there is a problem with a show like this and losing a member the show is about the group as a whole and the cohesion between the members. Kim Sook understands this well that is why early on she got the producers to take a step back and do an episode that frankly is a nd ripoff. Really just to allow the members to bond more and to show that bondyou can see the same thing in every other successful variety show like this having the members be a real group of friends and not just people who show up to work is incredibly importantso then to have a member drop hurts the group as a whole it loses an aspect no matter how small. I never really liked Song Joongki in Running Man but when he left the show lost something. They were able to work around that and make some more amazing stuff but there are also a lot of examples of shows that just started to fall apart after losing people Invincible Youth comes to mindyou lose a member you lose the audiences trust and leave a hole where they should be ,kpop,d6yp17q,4,t5_2r1ox

9191202,0,t3_565nao,Bisexual guy. Initially was just into fx before expanding outward because I like the punky rambunctious girl crush type image. Fan service and skinship for either sex can be a mixed bag. If its playful and cheeky I can get into it if it seems forced or hypocritical I see you Siwon then I just roll my eyes. I think Ive gotten more comfortable and expanded my choice of groups where initially I was reluctant to look into guy groups at all.As for potentially LGBT idols I hope that whoever is can at least be open within their group and company even if they cant with the public. One member who seems to be as open as he can be without actually saying it recently peaked my interest and gotten me more interested in his group. I guess cause I can sort of relate to what he must be going through assuming its true.Happy to see in the recent census that we make up around  around here. Makes me feel a little more welcome and acknowledged just because in real like we tend not to be a sizable out group even in queer spaces.,kpop,d8h1w2u,4,t5_2r1ox

Youre Pitiful Similar concept to Mirror which is why I love it. I think it works best for them.  One More Their transition to a more sexy concept. Dangerously catchy.  I Dont Know Cute concept. This song is incredibly catchy and the song is really sweet. You cant help but smile at the video  Also because Cheska former member is in this video. OT!  Vista Their debut song! IMO this is such a great debut song but really underrated. The video is also really cool!  I want to talk about all their songs honestly but I wont break the  song limit. But listen to their songs theyre all really good!   Members  Jei The leader of Fiestar. She featured in Infinites Paradise music video and was a cast in The Romantics and Idol.  Cao Lu The oldest member of Fiestar. Shes from China and debuted there. She is very popular for her personality and appearances on many variety shows.  Linzy Lead Vocalist.

She also answered some questions on rkpop! link   Why do I like this group?  Their songs are amazing. I got into them after hearing they were from the same company from IU and once I listened to Mirror I was hooked. Their concept in Mirror and Youre pitiful suits them extremely well. I also love their appearances on variety shows. Cao Lu is known for her personality on them and it really shows. Their choreography is great and so is Jei. Jei is perfect.

9478159,0,t3_5ahvkv,My comment will get lost in the sea of many but to reiterate and add my opinions to whats already been saidMusic show posts Debut stage very first comeback stage very last goodbye stage should get their individual posts as I think those are the most iconicimportant stages for any groups promotional cycle. I dont really mind the new format for music shows and its kind of easier since I only am interested in a variety of groups anyways so yall posting it makes it easier what I want to watch. Stale topics I dont really mind them being banned although the group dynamicsmembers ones were my favorites.People have been getting pretty creative now that theyve been banned and discussion questions as a result get more interestingunique although Ive seen some odd ones too. As for the Lets make a list of songs about INSERT TOPIC HERE! one thing I think would help not make that so stale is to  Have it be asked in a question format ex. What songs would you put on a playlist topic here and why? which then leads to  people having to actually answer the question in addition to just listing songs. For example  in the album discussions or threads like this one I try to list songs and briefly explain my reasoningschoices as well. I feel like if people encouraged that kind of participation on those kinds of threads there would be less seemingly endless links to MVs and more actual discussion taking place.Wiki development That sounds really neat! I think besides histories of groups and of rkpop it would be really neat if you were able to link certain threadscomments onto the appropriate subjectsa lot of the things I learned from this subreddit came from reading commentsposts that werent actual official links to YouTube channels websites or stuff like that.Use of the sub I choose to browse it by Hot at the start of the day to see what Ive missed while Ive been asleepat work and then New after that since its easier to find recent posts that way. AOB Thank yall for doing a fantastic job! Im sure this is probably a hard job to do and it must get tedious and thankless at times but this sub wouldnt be as great of a community as it is without all the hard work yall put into it and Im really appreciative of that since this is pretty much my only source of kpop news. Might be a silly question but is there like a clear line between sillyfun threads allowed on here and stuff suited more for rkpopslumberparty?

The group then announced theirdeparture from the label plus plans to create their own independent company. Unfortunately the  members will not be able to keep their group name because BST is registered as a trademark by Cube.The legal authority and rights to BST as a registered commodity in the areas ofmusic albums advertisements and artistperformances belongto Cube Entertainment until January  February  and April  of  respectively. Fans unearthed this discovery as early as this past July andhave beenconcerned about it since.This means if the group does not renew their contract with Cube itll be illegal for them to utilize the name BST including singing and performing songs under the group name.Meanwhile Cube has continuously denied the reports about BST forming their independent label and has taken the stance that theres still a possibility of the group renewing their contract with them.A rep from Cube stated We havent received feedback from the BST members yet. Of course we want BST to stay. We are still waiting for their answer. We have the rights to their name. If BST signs with another label then they might not be able to use the name BST for the next  years.I am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles.,kpop,d9hv0bg,4,t5_2r1ox

9587012,0,t3_5c9m1q,Bias for the group admitted but Jongup from B.A.P.  Hes technically the main dancer of the group and hes amazing too.  When B.A.P debuted he only had a line or two a song which he kinda shouted more than sang in most cases.  Now hes singing self composed songs has as many lines as Youngjae and has developed a rich and stable singing voice.  I actually think he might be overall a stronger singer than Youngjae at this point if a little less consistent live though he seems about on par in B.A.Ps stuff and his solo performances could be more because hes doing extremely demanding dance solos at the same time and thus less stable vocally due to exertionmovements.  Hes also been getting a lot of recognition for his visuals since B.A.Ps comeback last year.  Also in B.A.P Daehyun has always been recognized for his visuals carrying the nickname Visucal since their debut year.In BTS also Jin is severely underestimated.  His voice alone has always been my favorite but hes growing into being a very powerful singer.  Hes not quite there yet but he could easily hold his own in most kpop groups now and within BTS he actually has the most consistent supported tone even over Jimin who is getting better but still squeezes and flattens his tone especially on high notes and Jungkook though I would guess that this is more because of technique than skill as JK chooses to sing in a very breathy manner most of the time.  Jins song Awake off of Wings is easily my favorite on the album because he has a gorgeously emotive voice and he supports it. He just keeps improving every time we hear him!EDIT Ugh wrote this in a hurry and I had to fix my phrasing in a serious way.

I have to agree that it is not the norm most girls like guy groups because theyre handsome  theres a certain romantic attraction? As for me I follow girl groups because I like looking at pretty people following their makeup styles and its kinda like how people look at Krystal if I had to give an example? People might not be romantically attracted to her but its like a chic girl crush feel. Krystals not for me though but I have the same sort of feeling for all the girl groups that I follow. I got into SNSD first then NE not anymore though Wonder Girls etc. I like the cute refreshing groups like Red Velvet Lovelyz Oh My Girl and April. I like the idea of emulating them although that wouldnt go down well in real life. I also like singing cheerful songs! So girl group songs are a must have. The only guy group that I like is BTS and Ive liked them only since their rd anniversary festa so around June ? Although Im not entirely sure whether theres some romantic component involved I have to say that I dont really feel anything when they say stuff like ARMY is our girlfriend its all thanks to ARMY etc. The feeling I get is more like aww such sweet appreciative kids since I dont really count myself as an ARMY for some unknown reason. I think its a personality thing for this group I like how funny hardworking and humble they are and their group dynamicsfriendships. I do appreciate their visuals but somewhat in a similar way to the girl groups  I just like looking at pretty people. But like guy groups in general have similar tough dark edgy concepts which I dont really feel anything for  theres not really anything to emulate there? I do like SM groups throwback musical style though so I will listen to EXO and SHINee songs. I like kpop because of the music and I like specific members because theyre just chic inspiratory people in general. ,kpop,d9z1e50,2,t5_2r1ox

9659089,0,t1_da3nl4c,I think its most noticeable in the Twice fandom but its really a problem with fandoms as a whole. There is always going to be an usversusthem mentality and posting every milestone for every song just promotes that. We really dont need that here. Its getting bad enough as it is. There is more fighting between fandoms here than ever. Its really bringing the quality of the subreddit down.And to be honest this whole trend of being the fastest to a milestone is just another facet of the pissing contest. Its only real purpose is to say Hey look how cool my group is which is something I personally dont want on the subreddit. It just sets groups even more against each other.Also hiding posts is equivalent to stinking your head in the sand. Just because you like something doesnt mean I shouldnt be able to voice criticism against it.

I really really liked Roses guitar performance  natural smooth charming  very excited for future solos from her. Its a shame Lisa didnt get to talk much but at least she got to show off her skills! I hope they release the freestyle segment that was teased. YHS seems genuinely proud of the girls I hope they show us what he ended up buying for them through VApp. Rose switching to English when talking to Jennie Do you wanna walk over me? was interesting  I wonder if they and Lisa talk in English at home?,kpop,da402g1,88,t5_2r1ox
9661768,0,t1_da2gbwb,I completely disagree with your summation of Feis role in the her mv. Copying some of my sentiments from when the mv came outFeis video is a guy watching a private dance in what is made out to be a possibly illicit place of business. The focus is solely on Fei and her dancing. It is straight forward lacking any of the pretend cutesy and shy stuff and her wardrobe isnt flashy as she is wearing basic clothes a woman anywhere might wear black undergarments with sometimes a loose fitting black camisole or asymmetrical white blouse. I am a straight female but i appreciate when a woman is confident in her body and sexuality all while knowing she will probably face backlash for being slutty for it.Yeah the guy is a voyeur but Fei is the one ultimately in control who decides what show to put on in this situation. Her lyrics are also straight forward with her asking the guy to tell her what he wants and that she isnt naive about these sort of things. She isnt playing the viriginal innocent schoolgirl but the experienced woman who is promising to be this mans fantasy all he has to do is say what that fantasy is. This is definitely meant to more than titillate the guy watching there are various visual references to his arousal during the video. Even so Fei is the one shown to be making all the moves when even at the point she becomes real the guy never moves from his chair while she is the one to come to him and he never touches her but she touches him. Fei is putting on a performance for the male gaze but because she wants to not because she is forced to do so. She can be your fantasy if you ask but only if she wants to as when she says that it took her a while to make a decision but shes made up her mind.The video reminded me of BEG and Ga Ins solo work. Yeah shes sexy and she knows guys are watching but its more about sexy on her terms as a woman and not solely for the male gaze. Bloom is still an alltime favorite in exploring female sexuality from the womans POV in kpop that is at times almost explicit but that is the point not to shy away from it. Fei is offering herself as a fantasy but on her own terms instead of the more youthful sexy concepts we see regarding womens sexuality in kpop.I enjoy both and the way in which each woman displays their sexuality. Jia is very dominant and has a confident sexuality here in control wherease Fei is submissive to an extent while remaining in control and confident sexually as well. But i think i prefer the subversive nature of Feis a bit more myself. I also prefer that song and the Blade Runneresque nature of the video.,kpop,da40jx2,7,t5_2r1ox

Maybe thats not the files they had available at broadcast or maybe someone could be lying... The possibilities are endless. Edit Ill add that I cant imagine someone lying about such a thing would go to the trouble of being this specific about something they could easily be disproved about though.

All of this is confusing to me because if they did a recording with Taeyeons vocals then someone has access to the MR version of the song so that she could be recorded over it. And were in the internet age. Im sure if the DJ didnt bring it on his computer for whatever reason the recording studio could have sent one.Who the hell knows though.

9880438,0,t3_5guu5p,Honestly in hindsight Im surprised it took so long for something like this to happen. As much as I adore him in comparison to e.g. Mark and Jackson JB always seemed less progressive and if it wasnt for his talent Id never have pictured him on a stage  he kind of has that korean lad personality going on which in cases like this might not exactly be a positive thing.If youre asking me the root of this behaviour is simply lack of exposure. When shielded from the more niche parts of life for a lack of better words society can turn into an echo chamber and when confronted with things that dont belong into that chamber wow im going really heavy on the metaphors here people often react negatively. Basically JB who grew up in modern yet rather conservative Korea has most likely had only limited and provably distorted exposure to homobisexuality and is thus simply ignorant.Now this is only my attempt at explaining how it came to this. I absolutely condemn homophobia especially coming from someone who is the leader of my bias group. Like many others I hope GOTJYP especially Jackson and Markuse this as an opportunity to educate JB so he gets that exposure he might have been lacking to learn and grow.,kpop,davg073,37,t5_2r1ox

I watched them perform Galaxy without any expectations and I was blown away from how mysterious and sophisticated the song sounded. Usually when I experience a new song I like I read about the groups history and thats when I learned about the death of EunB and RiSe. I really respected and loved their musical direction following the tragedy. Im very eager for their next release.    I also was really happy for Wonder Girls. Reboot is one of my favourite kpop albums so I was looking forward to Why So Lonely. I actually didnt expect the song to do that well.

Middle school was pop all the way with Spice Girls and Nsync and Brittney Spears. Then high school came around and i refused to listen to pop only listened to indie stuff rock punk metal etc. excepting my childhood love of jpop and jrock because of video games and anime. I started branching out into kpop because BoA toward the end of high school but didnt care for it really till a few years into college and Wonder Girls came around with fun music. That was also around when i stopped being a pretentious ass and began listening to american pop music again. I still listen to all this and much more.

10090166,0,t1_dbmmkbd,you honestly believe the one in four narrative. During the LA riots the highest incidence of crime was  SEVENTEEN PERCENTDo you know what that means? In a free for all destruction symphony crime will only occur in less than one in  individuals. Now if you watched the video I linked that discusses the comparison of fake rape cases and divorced domestic abuse cases you will see a tread line that follows rape allegations. The other thing you have to consider is that colleges will get literal money from title nine for finding rape cases. SO when a woman wakes up and she has no clue what happened and suddenly claims rape you would have to be suspicious unless you were a dumb sack of shit. The other thing to take into consideration besides the fact that she was consensually slutting it up with Brock all night until this dumpster incident is the apologetic sex texts she sent her boyfriend. Rape is awful rape is a horrible crime but it does not happen frequently when Jim Goad was in jail he did not find a single person that liked rape. Have you ever had sex? Do you know how hard it is to slid your penis into a vagina? No you do not. In jail men get raped as a power dichotomy not because people enjoy rape. and what they do is they take a shank cut the asshole so its lubricated and then fuck them. Do you honestly thing getting finger blasted and then passing out can possibly fucking compare to getting stabbed and then penetrated and held down and beaten and stabbed again while some huge black guy rapes you. No it cant.actually look up the shit you claim to be passionate about women are the main perps in domestic abuse cases and men get raped the most.  That is simply fact. ,kpop,dbmrk9u,0,t5_2r1ox

Taemin is known to be one of the best if not the best dancer in kpop by both fans and critics alike. Jimin on the other hand while really good is still a novice compared to Taemin and he isnt even the best the group has to offer in term of dancing skills Jhope takes that title but Jimin is close behind. Which would result to ARMYs not all but you know who Im talking about maybe saying that Jimin outdanced Taemin which would then anger a lot of people and not only shawols as well as some nonfans saying that Jimin totally paled in comparison which ofc will make his fans incredibly mad. I was actually kinda disappointed that Taemin didnt participate in the street dance team today but instead had a solo dance performance followed by the dance tea but when I watched it I could totally see why they chose to do that since not only his style is very different but his skills were far above and those were some of the current best dancers in kpop Ten and Yugeom alone are a force to reckon with ,kpop,dbo5gwf,2,t5_2r1ox

10105823,0,t1_dboj3wk,Not that things still dont exist today or didnt prevail past that period in time but stigmatism was much more prevalent prior to the civil rights movement. Dancing like aan insert racial or cultural minority here would be done in mockery or when in earnest would be met with disapproval.    The Nae Nae is an imitation of a dance Martin Lawrence did while crossdressing during his television sitcom. I fail to see the deep cultural roots there. The other dances were just something fun created to move to a beat. If you have information that suggests otherwise feel free to share. Maybe one of these dances originated from an ancient burial ritual or was performed in internment camps or something similar and does indeed have deep cultural roots or connotations that I am unaware of. It didnt turn up with a simple google search.    My point is why should it matter to the Korean population that a new dance move originated in a predominantly African American area? Your implication is that it is somehow inappropriate or questionable you used the term problematic for Koreans to use these dance moves for that reason.    You didnt ask whether Koreans were aware of these American hip hop or dance trends you started with the title Black Cultural Appropriation? and the implication that kpop was somehow stealing or victimizing people.

10241636,0,t1_dc4w6hc,Okay I gasped when you first mentioned Hyojung since shes my bias and I thought you were gonna name examples of times where its obvious butgt  it seems like nobody ever laughs at her jokes people sort of look around awkwardly when she talks they ignore her attempts to draw attention etc. In one video Hyojung explicitly mentioned how Seunghee told her to tone it down.Dude isnt there like a staple member in every group thats like this? I mean off the top of my head from my bias groups I can think of Suho Wendy and Tiffany. Especially Suho whos also a leader and whose kids treat him exactly the same often worse. I think its just the vibe a lot of eldest members give off tbh. From what Ive seen though the younger members especially Arin seem to really respect and are fond of her. Shes definitely not the member I expected to you to mention. But if you were to twist my arm and make me choose one of them I might have said Binnie and Jine. But again thats not really fair since theyre naturally two of the quietest members in whats a particularly hyper group. If anything Ive seen the other members be considerate of their quieter natures whenever they interact with them.

Edited content is being created with the intention of slander so we have completed the process of filing a lawsuit for the spreading of false rumors and contempt.gt The agency concluded Also in order to prove that the video created misunderstandings because of the filming angle we have submitted the results of the videos analysis at an image research laboratory.gt Previously the controversy  first began when it appeared to some people as though Wooshin had placed his hand on Jeon Somis chest area in their Christmas message video.,kpop,dcergs3,20,t5_2r1ox
10328562,0,t1_dcef8zt,Well if the crux of your argument wasnt that mass streaming is more prevalent now and this whole unique listeners thing then I wouldnt really have an issue with your original comment because if youll read that that is basically your argument. And im saying that mass streaming isnt that much of a new thing so I dont see how that is an argument. One could argue these individual milestones arent quite as impressive simply because the YT audience has grown social media has grown but that would also correlate to the fact that audiences are bigger.  mil might not be as impressive anymore compared to say  mil now or something of the like simply because views are increasing all around on the platform. Even Western music videos reach  Billion pretty quickly nowadays due to an increased audience on YT. Kpop has grown on social media because social media is growing and allowing for that exposure. I think that is a valid argument one can make though I dont necessarily agree. So yes YT growing itself is a major factor and if that was what your original comment was based on then I wouldnt be replying to you.,kpop,dcestmk,2,t5_2r1ox

You know got? while basically tryna hook up with a girl over twitter DM or something.     About the snapchat party Marks house is nice to say the least. Got minus Youngjae idk why he wasnt there also idk if Jinyoung or JB went. probs not but if someone could correct me you know the drill. went to Marks house with Marks friends and had a huge ass party. In other words its a definite thing that Mark Jackson Bam Bam and Yugyeom were partying at Marks place. Marks friends had the smart idea of snapchatting some of the moments during the party. Some of these include a supposedly drunk Yugyeom and Bam Bam saying nigga after asking one of Marks friends what it meant Marks friend told him that it only means friend because Bam Bam didnt know what it meant and wasnt told how potentially offensive it could be.      Needless to say the aftermath wasnt pretty. Yugyeom got fatshamed he was filmed in swimming trunks with his shirt off and got shit for drinking which is odd but understandable. See the replies below Bam Bam was being told to leave Got He also never said anything about him saying nigga until he literally apologized of his own volition in the comments of an instagram photo because some fans speculate JYP didnt let him make a statement about anything that happened at Marks house Mark being told to leave Got too Marks friends being harassed like hell on social media with snake emojis which is kinda well deserved. I mean they were taking advantage of Mark and his fame and stuff. Hell I heard even Youngjae got dragged even though he had nothing to do with it at all.

I just had a massive fight with my exboyfriend because he wanted to have an open relationship because I was getting fat and he didnt find me attractive at my current weight tbf I was putting a lot of weight at that point in my life but still... shit my now exbest friend who I confided everything in told me that I was being immature about the whole situation amongst other things my hours at my old job had been slashed in half and my folks decided to extend their holiday leaving me feeling very much alone in the world. I had tried drinking the hurt away but all I was doing was throwing the alcohol up. I was miserable so I turned on Youtube and let the Up Next function take the wheel.Tonight came on and the uplifting instrumental the powerful vocals and the chanting just all the beautiful elements of the song combined into this beautiful ball of positive energy for me at that time and helped me dance around the house like a loony for a good while alcoholinduceddancingeuphoria was a great cure for the blues. From then on whenever Ive been feeling down Ive turned Tonight on amp just chilled out relaxed and focused on the music and its always calmed down.For being that little ray of light in a really shitty spot of my life SPICA will always hold a place in my heart. So it hurts that I know Im never going to hear anything new from them however I know their fantastic tracks are always going to live on.

TOP Media is inexperienced in or maybe simply incapable of dealing with a group this old. I agree with the rest of your comment. Absolutely a lot of work needs to be put into a group this far along in their career. Thats why there is such a bottleneck at the  year mark.So is it worth keeping them around after their contracts expire? You seem to be pointing to no while I think if they put effort into it with the qualities I listed above they can keep going. It would take work but they have the talent. Of course they wouldnt be on top or as successful as Infinite but they would survive and could even expand their fandom.

They send them to Japan because massive concerts can happen in Japan and these concerts are so profitable. Example Look at these earnings  from SHINee activities in the first quarter of gt Arena tour . billion won     Osaka Kyocera Dome . billion won     Tokyo Tokyo Dome . billion won     Taemins solo album . billion wonRemember these are company earnings not individual artist earnings. If I were SHINee I would gladly take  of overseas promotions and  of album sales rather than the reverse.Another example How do you think Big Bang made M  with only k album sales from their Japanese album in ?

One is his full name Park Chanyeol while the other says LOEY.gtLOEY appears to possibly be yeol from Chanyeol inverted.

He obviously needs help. This sort of thing doesnt just happen what  times? He needs therapy or people to work him out of this a sort of AA would be great too. But knowing how SKorea views mental health it scares me that its just gonna happen again.

Companies do this all the time EXO released  versions of their album this isnt a unique case especially since album versions are total cash grabs in the first place. Its the same songs but just some extra photos and photocard that cost a fraction of what theyre making with the album only fans will want and companies know that. With WG pm and GOT theyve only released maybe  versions and member centric ones for the boys. Its only recently that JYPs mustered up the courage to go all out in this way for one of their groups. Other than JYPs played pretty safe when it comes to albums again this is really the first time theyve done this kind of thing while I can name plenty of other companies that do this all the time.  ,kpop,ddmto5w,5,t5_2r1ox

Interestingly this is exactly how  records worked back in the s and s.  Bands would release singles on  with another song on the back when you flipped the record over the Bside.  After releasing a few s they would collect those together into an LP or Album as a sort of compilation basically exactly the same as MADE.

It made me like sohye initially until they gave her too much airtime and i got annoyed. I do admit it was kind of unfair to the other more talented girls that didnt make the cut though. But look at how much Sohye has grown as a member of IOI.This moonbok guy is gaining support to punish female viewers just because they couldnt fap to yeonjung.

But in terms of official statements in Kpop Hyunseung and Beast might be one of rare ones that have some truth to it different opinions on music.Its easy to see with how different his solo album is from Beast and Troublemakers vibe. His personal tastes and desire for what he wanted to do musically might have clashed with Junhyung and his hold over Beasts music.Also since his fathers death hes been a totally different person just from public appearances alone. In their Showtime variety in  you really get the feel that he isnt as close to the other five anymore you repeatedly see them saying I wonder what Hyunseungs thinking.All of this is speculation though which is all anyone can do at this point.,kpop,dev7ggy,13,t5_2r1ox

He understands where his talent lie and found a niche for himself. I thought she found her niche in variety but it seems this thread has made me think otherwise. And since Amber is a foreign idol I think it is extra hard to be succesful as a foreign idol in Korea. Victoria at least has a chance in China but American Korean idols cant succeed in America racism is a huge part of that but I wont go into it. ,kpop,dfepsrn,34,t5_2r1ox

Mostly space and wanting to be happy with items in my home. If an agency jacked around something that would make me feel really bothered when I looked at it Id likely skip it.

JUST RELEASE A FUCKING MINI ALBUM. WHAT THE FUCK. FUCK. If YGE actually has them release double singles at least  more times this year Ill be happy. But whatever number they give us now it will likely not be that many see BLACKPINK. Though they we did get the four months of MADE as promised so who knows. I dont see a number or proposed schedule yet so I guess we will have to see what they say especially on the YGLife blog. Though the circumstances are different whatever issues Taehyun went through this better not be the fucking EXIT series all over again. Im wondering if theyre taking the cautious approach since a member left? Release these songs see public reaction reevaluate for next comeback?Regardless Im not a fan of this move at all. If they follow through though sure I can see why  smaller comebacks could be better than  albumEP releases. I like that theyll be doing more variety though I guess. ,kpop,dfju9rx,23,t5_2r1ox

As uDravvie is explaining it has to drastically impair your ability to function in every day life to garner a diagnosis.  Often times triggers like stress or workload or trauma can cause a disorder to either develop or become more prominent. As for Taehyun we cant really say what truly caused the split.  It could have had nothing to do with music and everything to do with the company.  It would have had to have been something that was literally tearing him apart if they wanna say his mental health was so bad he had to leave.

Those wrongful accusations still affect BTS.They should be glad ARMYs arent trending negative hashtags against any artists or harming their faves which could really have a negative impact on them.

The dancing was incredible and it brought about the first of their dramatic MVs Ill never forget all the cinematic prologues and great album tracks that came with it.NE I am the BestLonelyUglyHate You was also their best era imo and honestly each of those songs were so unique from each other and so solid as individual singles it really feels nostalgic for me.

Through doing this he opened up the opportunity for the  superpowers to collaborate which at the beginning Reagan wasnt interested in doing he called them an evil empire. This new collaboration lead to the START treaty that you mentioned. He also played a key role in the collapse of the USSR by implementing his policies of Glasnost and Perestroika. Glasnost Openness allowed the soviet citizens to see that the lives of the people in the capitalist west were much better than theirs undermining the credibility of the party. Perestroika I cant really remember anything about but I think it allowed private enterprise to some degree Gorbachevs removal of the Brezhnev doctrine saw the decline and eventual collapse of the Eastern Bloc. Many of those countries ended up joining the west. Ironically his new changes were meant to save the USSR but by the end even Gorbachevs position of General Secretary became obsolete.Thanks for biting I guess it will only be a matter of time until Godwins law happens ,kpop,dga1zan,4,t5_2r1ox

11715371,0,t3_675zy5,Before kpop I mainly listened to pop punk punk and alternative bands. I still listen to the bands that I liked before getting into kpop but I dont really branch out and try to find new groups within those genres to listen to. Listening to kpop has made me more open to listening to Western pop music. After I got out of my pop stage around the BSB NSYNC Spice Girls era I didnt really listen to much Western pop. And if I did I would kinda hide it like a secret because it wasnt cool because I liked real music which is dumb. So yeah kpop has made me more appreciative of Western pop. But it has also really cut back on the amount of new Western music that I discover because I do spend the majority of my music time listening to kpop and finding new kpop artists. ,kpop,dgnyswp,103,t5_2r1ox

11730444,0,t1_dgpbp67,The openness is especially noticeable in female vocals. Artists like Sia Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga have distinct rawrough voices unlike the typical smooth and sweet kpop girl voice. Maybe its a Korean preference for calm and cutesy?

I would say that WG was afforded a proper chance to make it in the US especially since they had a TV movie but its very hard to gain any traction especially in the United States. EXP Edition even with proper fans and proper support may not have a good chance to make it in KPop because the industry is so saturated. Koreans even have difficulty with this.
