5838047,0,t3_3v0cq2,Primarily this is a sub for social anarchists specifically. Its a broad term so I can unpack some of it. Usually social anarchism is defined as an umbrella term that encompasses anarchocommunism anarchosyndicalism anarchocollectivism social ecology platformist anarchism mutualist anarchism and insurrectionary anarchism the last two can be either social or individualist. A distinction that separates individualist anarchism from social anarchism is that we believe individual freedom hinges upon mutual aid and a strong sense of community. Unlike individualists who often oppose collaboration beyond a small amount we embrace it. As social anarchists we understand the complex interactions between individuals and society. While society is formed out of individuals individuals are influenced by those around them. We are social animals and rarely act independently the individualist opposition to fulfillment of social needs is as I see it a negative. Despite the terminology I see individualism and collectivism as myths and collective and individual liberation depend in each other. Many individualist anarchists ignore the crucial element of interaction.,socialanarchism,cxkw89r,2,t5_3a2rs

I once had an ayncrap tell me overfishing is caused by regulations on the industry because it forces the companies to fish more to compensate for their losses caused by the regulations.,socialanarchism,cz5fdtz,2,t5_3a2rs

7013614,0,t1_d1batb9,gtIf a scientific organizations position on a subject is rigid and unchanging or in any way founded on ideology rather than empirical evidence thats where I think the alarm bells are.I agree. Thats more what I meant by flipflop  swayed by moneypolitics. I should have been a little more clear on that.gtAnd with this in mind its quite surprising to me that these organizations acknowledge the merits of veganism at all.Good point thanks for pointing it out.I noticed the thing with the comments too. I thought my phone was just being a dickhead. I hope that doesnt recur.Im also curious as a veg how have you adjusted your diet? Just wondering if you eat a lot of tofu or tempeh or quinoa? Are your food expenses kind of high or low? ,socialanarchism,d1bcak4,1,t5_3a2rs
