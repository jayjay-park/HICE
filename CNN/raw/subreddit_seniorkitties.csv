5149182,0,t3_3l1buj,I just cant imagine losing a furry companion after all that time. Her and her cat had more time together than some of her friends will with her I bet. That is just an immense period of time for a cat. Gosh. ,seniorkitties,cv6o526,2,t5_31m29

7847360,0,t3_4jclm7,If her stools are hard maybe she needs some fiber?Does she get wet food  which will also help with hydration.Try some pureed pumpkin.  You can find pouches at pet stores.Mix it with the normal wet food.  My cats get pumpkin once a week.  They sometimes turn their nose at it but eventually will eat it.  They have nicer bowel movements the next few days.,seniorkitties,d3y423l,1,t5_31m29

9553516,0,t1_d9pq90p,Aww. Im not sure when we started calling Smudge Moo Cow. Probably back when he was fat. Its a good name for a chubby black and white spotted kitty.,seniorkitties,d9qo29p,1,t5_31m29
9631775,0,t1_da05ola,Thank you  Its not been easy. My poor guy still has such a will to live to eat treats and snuggle and talk to me and be otherwise normal. I hate that after all he went through this is what does him in. If he were younger and did not have kidney disease periodontal disease and a heart murmur I would opt for treatment.Im trying to make sure I dont neglect myself too. He cuddles with me every night. Im doing my best to be home as much as I can when I dont have to be at work so I can spend time with him. I am glad that at least I have the ability to be with him and make him feel loved and safe and comfortable for a little while longer. lt,seniorkitties,da0bbpg,2,t5_31m29
10536777,0,t3_5qvs84,He has dental issues which were easily resolved and a weird cauliflower ear and z few months ago there were UTI problems but this kg fluffball is here to stay at any rate. He is really big vet says he is not overweight just very large and in charge and loves to cuddle on the couch. He likes to roam around our garden and protects us from intruders aka that one neighbour cat that seems to assume this is still his territory. He is so sweet and i have no idea why he ended up in a shelter. Weve had him almost a year now. ,seniorkitties,dd2gkq8,22,t5_31m29
