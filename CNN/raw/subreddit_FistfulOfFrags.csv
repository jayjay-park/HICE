992112,0,t1_chgsxgz,I think the game is made so they stay there just long enough for the killer to get the weapon from the one they killed. Finding high tier weapons everywhere would ruin the reward of killing someone with a high tier weapon or finding a closed high tier chest.,FistfulOfFrags,chh26mb,3,t5_31po0

1163596,0,t3_26ux5x,So OP you wana give out footjobs? Good for you! We need big hairy man to ease our stress on the field of combat. The main thing you wana do is really use your feet! Pressure on the tip is important along with some toe action. Use both of your feet obviously to really get the whole thing stimulated. You can use the blunt parts of the hatchet and the knife to perform an orreeantal massahage on these poor folks.Actually though just practice it aint too hard.,FistfulOfFrags,ci0ivcl,1,t5_31po0

5104148,0,t3_3kv719,Ive actually never had much of a problem with the gun.  Its only really lethal when your right up in someones face and you can easily backpedal away.  It makes a good ambush weapon but I dont think its comparable to the Mares Leg in OPness.It USED to be devastating before gun throwing was nerfed because even when you missed the shot kill you could almost always finish them off by throwing it at them which is always hilarious,FistfulOfFrags,cv18nm6,5,t5_31po0

10671147,0,t3_5sn2nz,See this post on the Steam forums for an explanation of Shootout ranking system its not based strictly on notoriety but rather on your frags and deaths only modified by the notoriety reward of both the frags AND deaths and also the rank score of the other player involved. The system uses diminishing rewards so the higher your score gets the harder it becomes to keep it.As for VS if youre in top  or maybe even top  youll get rank decay if you dont play for a certain amount of time probably a week so thats all I can think of for the sudden drops in a couple hundred points. Resetting to  is a known bug but keep complaining to the dev on the Steam forums because hell only take notice if enough people whine,FistfulOfFrags,ddgnc3q,2,t5_31po0
11301123,0,t3_616tvv,Not all guns need to be the oneway ticket to the top on their own. Standing alone the Navy beats the Volcanic but the Volc fills the role of second gun superior to the Navy. Take the Volcanic if youre pretty certain youll find a second handgun soon. Take the Navy if youre playing it safe. Dont nerf the Navy anymore. The fanfire has already been gutted. Its the ol reliable in the starter weapons. ,FistfulOfFrags,dfcyrsp,2,t5_31po0
