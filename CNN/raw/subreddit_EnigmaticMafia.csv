7835574,0,t3_4mlvrc,Sigh Oh CDB. Im not really sure why he had to paint a target on his back but we probably wouldnt have kept him long anyway...Im a little nervous we made the wrong decision in lynching TNtM. The whole town is saying anyone who voted for her is mafia which is exactly what happened. If the librarian comes out were gonna have huge targets on our backs. We need to be on the lookout for them as much as we can.I agree with the others that SecretSquirrel is a good target for tonight. She throws around lots of accurate suspicions and is a huge help to the town. Its much easier to attack the active players this game without any lookout roles watching us!

7883935,0,t1_d427nbm,I made some theoretical claims.I hope this doesnt get me lynched lol. Also Ill not tell HWW but Ill tell yall  something seems wrong with my numbers but I dunno what the hell it is considering that I took the list literally directly from the original post. That post says we have  players if theyre numbered correctly but I counted  players AL and  players MZ and those two numbers do not add up to . ,EnigmaticMafia,d4286ri,1,t5_3esdv
7895615,0,t3_4nehk7,Ok I think we need to try to lynch Snake Jailbird today. Like I know theyre helping us kill people but if we keep having  kills a night the odds of us getting killed are VERY high as are the odds of getting lynched. Fewer kills a night will give us more control. My top  suspects for Snake are MsSunshine littlebs darthrobynI think we should lynch one of them today. Ill let you know later in the day who I suspect more. If darthrobyn comments today then shes off the list.,EnigmaticMafia,d43jgs6,2,t5_3esdv
