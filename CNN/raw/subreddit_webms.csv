936020,0,t1_chalm59,Ive already tried a handful of encoders and Im trying to figure out the best one. Miro converter is pretty straight forward with decent file sizes. Freemake converter is pretty good it even lets you split and cut the file to before choosing to convert but its pretty slow and spits out  file formats for html video at a time .mp ogv webm. Couldnt figure out how to make it only give me one if its even possible. Favorite one so far as of yesterday is xmedia recode. Im still trying different ones out. I tried using megui but I couldnt quite get it to work. ffmpegtheora used the command line but it doesnt make webm only ogv which isnt that of a big deal to meWhat do you mean wont capture subtitles? I know you can import .srt files on your video with xmedia recode and I know free make converter also has options for subtitles as well,webms,chaoijy,1,t5_305sf
