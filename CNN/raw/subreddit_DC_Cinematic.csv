Honestly Reynolds would have made a better Barry BatsonFlash than a Hal Jordan.  They should have just made John Stewart the default GL.  The JL would have been more diverse then.I also advise caution to the WB when making Martian Manhunter.  A hes an alien and moreso than Superman and B hes too damn similar to Superman.And...its safe to say that Aquaman cant carry his own movie.  Honestly would we lose too much if he wasnt included?

3699643,0,t1_cqdz33j,Theres a certain degree of common sense to it as well.Whether she likes it or not Wonder Woman is tied to feminism and isnt judged purely on her own merits as a character or story but also the message that she puts forward about such ideals.The problem is that in a modern setting pluralistic society hasnt even decided or agreed upon what feminism is or should be and theres a certain amount of infighting.  Its too risky to take a strong position on that in modern times and alienate your audience.So a period piece allows you to go back to a time when there was more unity in the feminist cause because they were fighting for more baseline ideals... similar to how Captain American needs to start as a period piece because unwavering patriotism is jingoism in modern times but a virtue when fighting Nazis.  Then after your characters baseline is established you can challenge that with more nuance.Irrespective of the actual period picked Ill take the bet that Wonder Womans first film is a period piece in part if not entirely.,DC_Cinematic,cqdzfju,1,t5_2ykm6

4779418,0,t3_3gbu8u,I think Bruces motivations are laid out pretty nicely in the trailer. And it sounds like a pretty solid rationale for taking out Superman. Based on his experience in Gotham good men are either killed or corrupted. He doesnt believe KalEl is immune to that and supposes that he may one day turn against mankind.  This is combined with the overall feeling of impotence that has always fueled the Batman. Having been unable to stop the death of his parents or his Robin Wayne is enraged by the state of powerlessness that he has so often lived in. This feeling is compounded upon the discovery of Superman a being that makes the entire human race powerless. I think thats the real reason why hes trying to take down Clark Kent. ,DC_Cinematic,ctwziz7,11,t5_2ykm6

Sure he explores the gray area between good and evil and isnt hopelessly supportive of Clark in a onedimensional sort of way and thats what I appreciate.

5048023,0,t1_cursmlq,As a fan of Marvel DC Image and a couple other comic distributors I just want to add that when I was growing up people made fun of Marvel movies because they couldnt compare to the dark knight series. And at that point there was no real arguing with it. There was daredevil and ghost rider and a bunch of movies that people werent raving about. Fanboyism isnt exclusive to just Marvel. Its just a really good time to be a Marvel fan. And if Marvel ever fucks up expect a massive migration to DC or any other fashionable bandwagon at the time.

6191542,0,t3_40do9l,To me the best aspect of the character is his typical ignorant bogan personality which John Ostrander nailed in his and the best run on Suicide Squad. According to Jai Courtney his first instruction when portraying the character was to find your inner shitbag.I love how chaotic and wannabe gangster his appearance is like hes from a really ghetto area in Australia. I honestly think his ridiculous personality and appearance will be what people will remember with the fact that he employs an Indigenous Australian hunting tool as his primary weapon being the cherry on top. Speaking of which why isnt there a Captain Boomerang flair?The Arrow interpretation was so bland as it tried to justify the weapon and spent no time at all on exploring the character. ,DC_Cinematic,cytevsf,11,t5_2ykm6

6231757,0,t1_cyxcdoi,Im going to tell my personal experience I was shocked when Supes killed Zod. I literally jumped out of my seat. I was a regular watcher of Smallville and I have my fair share of Superman comics one of them is a reprint of What Happened To The Man Of Tomorrow? so my Superman didnt kill.  After some time and rewatchs of MoS I understand that it was probably the only option. What I dont like is that the writers specifically wanted for Supes to kill. They were determined in doing that. Why? I watched Superman II sone time after MoS came out and I think the end ruins it. Supes killed some guys without even being sorry. At least in MoS hes suffering it. I would have prefered that Zod was sent to the Phantom Zone along his crew but only after that frigging cool fight I dont know. My point is I now understand and accept the inmovie reasons. I still dont like the real world reasons. ,DC_Cinematic,cyxze0y,3,t5_2ykm6

6681363,0,t3_475gps,Superman The Movie is might be my favourite comicbook film. Sure some of the jokes rear projection and the end is a little silly but doesnt ruin the film for me. It has this magical feel that makes me smile instantly when I watch it. The film also takes its time and the scope of the film feels big.The cast is great. Brando though being a total dick at the time does bring the film a lot of gravitas. All the major players from Hackman to Kidder are great but the one who stands out is Christopher Reeve. For me he is Superman.  He pulls of the boy scout while being very relatable and his Clark is a lot of fun.What makes the film stand out from the other superhero films is that it feels more like a fairytale than a action film. The relationship between Lois and Superman is propably the best in any superhero film. I do think the first film still  holds up quite well.Superman II is bit of a different story. From the film its obvious that they had production problems but its a pretty good film.Most of the cast returns except for Brando and theyre still excellent. Reeve is great and gets to show some of his dramatic chops. This time Superman has to face three kryptonian bad guys lead by Terrence Stamps Zod and they bring a lot of fun to the film. Especially Stamp who plays a great full of himself dickhead.Unfortunately a lot of the film doesnt hold up anymore. The director Richard Lester wanted to make the film even more campy and it dates the film quite a bit. While a lot of the action scenes are fun the confrontation at the Fortress of Solitude is silly but the lover of schlock that I am gets good chuckles from it. Throwing an S out of his chest and other strange powers are a bit questionable. Also Superman throwing the bad guys into the abyss with a smile on his face is ridiculous. I know theres a deleted scene where they take the kryptonians to the police but its not in the actual film so the viewer will assume they die. The scene makes me laugh so I take it.Its not as good as the first one but its still pretty good.The Richard Donner Cut which came out in  while being a Frankensteins monster of a film is a big improvement over the theatrical version of II. It feels more like Donners Superman and completes the story in an epic way. The film is more serious and the addition of Brando elevates it.The problem with this film is that the film doesnt really work alongside original Superman and I dont know if it can be appreciated without the knowledge of some of the behind the scenes problems. Overall though its an improvement and makes me a bit sad that they fired Donner. His Superman II could have been a masterpiece.,DC_Cinematic,d0aetwh,3,t5_2ykm6

It was documentarystyle for a reason and it served the story. I understand your complaints though.Now Batman v Superman isnt from Clarks perspective.

Did you see us brazilians lose our shit? No. Complain if you want but its not like they ruined a character. Different writers can have different views of many characters. Again look at Jason. In Battle for the Cowl he looks dumb and borderline psychopathic while in the New hes closer to normal and just disagrees with Batman.

6897905,1,t1_d0y54rr,Its not that Trump is evil per se. Hes just dumb. If I were a US citizen Id cote Republican but Trump usnt someone who has a wellthought and functional plan for the US. He has simplistic and dumb answers to problems he has no idea how to solve. Making Mexico pay for a huge border wall? Are you nuts?Its just like Bernie Sanders... None of these morons has any functional plan even if they have a plan that doesnt mean the plan will work and appeal to the emotions of the masses whether its shouts against unequality or against illegal imigrants and terrorism.If they arent dumb personifications of politics then Sanders and Trump are actors playin a role they know will get a lot of votes. In that case theyre particularly evil.Unfortunately its easier to hate on the asshole who thinks he can force another country to build a border wall with the US than it is to hate on the asshole who openly believes in socialism and never comments on why anything based on that system fails sooner or later unless he said something like they deturped Marx which is complete and utter bs but thats not the focus of my point.,DC_Cinematic,d0y72a8,0,t5_2ykm6

6906719,0,t3_4ac877,I thought the TDKR was fantastic. Is it the best of the trilogy? I dont think so because The Dark Knight not only set the bar so high for the sequel but for every comic book movie that followed  be it Marvel or DC. I imagine that even Nolan struggled with TDKR especially after the masterpiece that was The Dark Knight. He probably thought to himself Oh man how am I going to top this?Also the ending is the most Batmanesque ending ever. I legitimately thought he died until Lucius checked the ID on the autopilot patch. I thoroughly enjoyed the ending  especially Alfred sees Bruce at the end.,DC_Cinematic,d0z72d7,4,t5_2ykm6

6909469,0,t3_4ach4j,First Id suggest rewatching Man of Steel. I recently did and my opinion of it is much better than it was before the rewatch. Still has its flaws but it makes me more confident for BvSSecond there is a difference between dark and muted colors. Man of Steel had muted colors that I wasnt fond of but the trailers make it look like that filter is gone for BvS. I love the brightness of Marvel movies too but DC is going for more of a grand epic almost mythological and I think this style can work really well for them. Also Im sure there will be a lot of light too. Man of Steel had a lot of light people just forget because of the muted colors.If you really cant get hyped up dont worry about it. Go see the movie with an at least open mind and maybe youll love it but if you truly want to go into the film excited this is really all I can offer you.,DC_Cinematic,d0zibar,2,t5_2ykm6

I think Snyder getting so much flak is kind of deserved. What kind of reaction are you going to expect when the kickstarter to the DCEU is a mediocretobad film? And the same filmmaker is also helming the DCEUs flagship entry thats meant to introduce the Justice League? I mean look at the backlash Whedon got after Age of Ultron its no different.People hate bad movies. Shocker. Difference is Whedon was smart enough to bow out of the MCU film business altogether because he recognized it was far too great a burden for him. WB is running with Snyder and thats why people are so discouraged.,DC_Cinematic,d12mzo0,2,t5_2ykm6

6976176,0,t1_d172qmq,In my opinion Rorschach Dr. Manhattan The Comedian and Nite Owl II were perfectly cast and I seriously cannot imagine anyone else doing it. However Malin Akerman and Matthew Goode were absolutely awful especially Matthew Goode. Im sure that guy is a great actor in his own right Ive never seen him in anything so I have no idea but he could not have been a worse Ozymandias. Hes supposed to be this metaphorical giant of a man that oozes charisma and Goode was none of that. He was a scrawny and lanky stick and he sort of had this obnoxious air about him that had you guessing he was the villain the entire time. One of my favorite parts of the graphic novel is that you really have no idea that Adrian is behind everything until the characters figure it out but in the movie its just so obvious that Matthew Goode is the bad guy.There were rumors and talks of Jude Law originally being offered the role and I think that would be cool. Off of the top of my head I cant really think of a good choice for him but almost anyone would be better than Matthew Goode.,DC_Cinematic,d1735hn,2,t5_2ykm6

That was  a real complaint from one of their reviewers though.    gtSo what you see is a bunch of people getting their asses kicked oh look its Hulk smashing robots!  Oh look its Captain America smashing robots!  Oh look its Thor...you get the picture.  The problem is you have a combination of factors that contribute to losing focus.  Shaky cams extreme closeups shots that last for less than a second and a furious attempt to give every hero equal time wherever they are.  None of the action really seems tailored to each superheros unique abilities and the settings within the city are always changing.

7002665,0,t1_d19w1m5,So XMen Days of Future Past was heavily liked by the critics because it was like Marvel? Many of the reviews I read said that Jesse Eisenberg was over doing it and that his portrayal did not fit what was going on in the movie. Is that saying be more like Marvel? A couple of reviews actually criticized the opening due to it jumping around between  or  different scenes that made it feel disjointed. Is that saying be more like Marvel? One review said that the Bruce scene could not sit well with many people. Is that saying be more like Marvel? To me none of those problems are saying be more like Marvel.Seriously a review is how that person feels about the movie that is why you have to see a movie for yourself to formulate your own opinion. Do you really think that scores dictate whether a movie is good or not. I hope that all of the DC fans because I know there are people who have been waiting for this movie for years really like this movie. As long as you like the movie why do reviews matter so much? Not everyone will like the same thing.I honestly think that there is a reason as to why Suicide Squad has more excitement around than BvS hashad. The movie looks like its going to have fun. Thats not being like Marvel thats taking the concept of villains trying to be heroes and not trying to be ber serious with it. This movie especially with he reviews made the Marvel vs DC crap even worse. In a time where people should just be excited that we are getting these characters on the big screen we are worried about review scores.

7005542,0,t1_d1advsa,V For Vendetta changes the politics of the novel almost completely. Now if you think thats better sure. But I mean the message of the book is gone. I like the film but it tells a different story. I wouldnt want someone to watch the movie and think they know the book. But if you watched Gone Girl its essentially the novel as a movie.Changing the ending of Watchmen was way less destructive. Swapping the giant squid into Dr. Manhattan actually changed things a lot when you think about the deeper meanings behind the two beings but in my opinion the film actually improved the ending. Moores original version is a nice payoff for bits of foreshadowing left in every issue but they brought new meaning to Dr. Manhattan who simply left in the novel but becomes an Abrahamic god figure in the film completing the arc while strengthening themes of cyclical history inherent in the story.You have one version of the story where the United States unites with Communist Russia because the world is afraid of an alien invasion that will never come.Snyders version is kind of brilliant. They angered their walking nuke and he disappeared. Days later cities around the world are destroyed and Manhattan isnt around to sit down and talk. People may want to speak to him or to hear what he wants but hes silent like the gods that people have always prayed to. The Hiroshima connection also becomes much clearer since Manhattan is actually atomic. And early in the story they talk about how Dr. Manhattan cant be everywhere at once and yet Ozymandias lie has actually made him appear more powerful than he really was. Society becomes more compassionate as a result of fear just like stories of apocalyptic destruction by a watchful and jealous god scared some good into civilization. But belief in God has never kept people behaving for long so we can better reflect on this than with the giant squid and realize why that Ozymandias peace wont last. That after a while people will realize that Dr. ManhattanGod isnt watching and even if he is he doesnt seem to care anymore and theyll do whatever they feel like.,DC_Cinematic,d1af892,2,t5_2ykm6

7006896,0,t3_4be9df,I wasnt a fan of MoS I thought it had some good parts but generally fell short of my expectations. Snyder got me to hold out hope that some of the things I didnt enjoy in MoS the destruction bleakness Supermans demeanor was necessary for BvS and would ultimately benefit it.I ultimately have the same opinion for BvS. While there were a few things that I enjoyed Martha how Batman looks and moves I was too soon! heck I even liked WW more than I thought I would it ultimately gave me more that I didnt like. The tone the destruction the ultra violence.This Batman has no qualms with killing it appears. Or with guns but one was in a dream one was a grapple gun and Im not sure about the one at the end... so Ill leave that. I mean I love how he looks and moves about visually he is easily the best Batman weve seen in liveaction. And I thought that Martha scene was very nice. But this Batman is arguably more violent than TDKR Batman.I didnt care at all for Lex. There are bits in the movie where he comes off as more Joker than Lex Luthor. Also there were pretty much no surprises in the movie. Based on the trailers we more or less knew how the story was going to unfold. The only surprises were just a few oneoff scenes. I think fans of MoS will probably enjoy this movie. And visually it was great. I dont regret going to see it or paying the  but to me it was very much a popcorn movie. I think it would have benefited from a new director. Please dont be too cruel. ,DC_Cinematic,d1akrto,13,t5_2ykm6

Its a serious film one that looks passed the preconceived perceptions of the medium it is based on and actually tries to do more than just give something to eat popcorn to.Thats not true IMO.  Are you forgetting or just ignoring the slew of dark superhero movies weve seen for the past decade?  The Nolan Batman trilogy Watchmen Man of Steel.  These are major films.  You cant try to say people didnt know that superhero movies can be gritty and violent.The Marvel onslaught has kind of recoated the genre as familyfriendly but I think TDK was such a popular movie that I think people are well aware that this genre can be shiny and silly or gritty and grim.

7039405,0,t1_d1e83ph,Yes but that was still in between shots of them glorifying the violence as an exciting battle whereas this entire scene made it look like the horrifying devastation it was.  I thought the scene was incredibly effective and wish the rest of the movie couldve followed what made this whole scene so good it made things personal for Bruce.  Almost the whole movie was people waxing philosophical about gods and power without ever really exploring the concepts with any depth and that sacrificed personal investment in the characters.  I liked Batfleck  I thought he was a fun Batman and a believable Bruce but there werent really any moments like that MoS battle where I empathized with him greatly and even related to him somewhat.  Same with Superman I never cared about him as a character in this movie.  His death didnt make me the least bit sad which is a tragedy in and of itself.  But that one scene took the overthetop carnage from MoS and made it reminiscent of  in some ways and it became real to the viewers and seeing Bruce through it all made it personal.  That scene focused on character even in the action to a degree the rest of the movie never did.  I hope Justice League follows that scene as an example.,DC_Cinematic,d1e9ub0,4,t5_2ykm6

Zack already confirmed bringing back Superman will be a HUGE task and not another let him undry in the sun for a little bit situation.                The assembly is also not going to be a simple matter of finding people. So far the movies all had several arcs they combined into one no way theyll settle the assembly and just show a couple of paratroopers holy fuck I hated the Avengers ending here have a thousand useless peasant s so even the useless teammembers can demonstrate their useless superpower at the League. I think the cliffhanger is going to be INSANE. Darkseid is going to be on the offence. Justice league is trying to somehow revive Superman but Dark interrupts them and captures half of the team.

7051931,0,t3_4c7apb,Oh dear... I have a lot to say. For the purposes of warning those who really enjoyed the movie most of what I have to say is negative hopefully constructive criticism so please do not be offended. Im a big DC fan and Im rather passionate about this so prepare for semirestrained NERD STRESS.THE GOOD Wonder Woman was glorious and her theme! Alfred was pitch perfect. The sass was so wonderfully delivered and he added some much needed levity to the film. The badassery of Batfleck in costume. Batmans modulated voice combined with the costume finally sold Batman as someone that the most messed up criminals would still find terrifying. He was imposing as all hell and you could feel such a sense of threat and foreboding around him. The fight sequences are excellent  theyre gorgeous to look at and exciting to watch. The Batmobile chase was pretty exhilarating too. Great opening sequence with Batmans origin. I liked that they summarised that rather quickly for us and loved how it was shot. Very stylish. Cool Justice League teases with the surveillance footage especially getting to see Cyborgs creation. Yes it was a tad contrived but I couldnt help but be excited by it. Grannys Peach Tea was actually sort of clever. I liked the plot twist with the explosion but wished we had seen Superman testify first and got the court to agree with him  it would have made their deaths much sadder.THE BAD As someone who loved Jesse Eisenburg in The Social Network I was one of the people who really held out hope for Lex and defended him after the trailers came out so it really hurts me to say this but  Lex Luthor is in my opinion truly terribly acted terribly written and his motivations make absolutely no sense. There is nothing threatening or interesting about him and he comes off as a cringeworthy embarrassing attempt at the Joker. I literally heard groans whenever he came on screen. He broke much of the movie for me. I understand what they were referencingattempting to do in the Knightmare sequence but it was presented in a way that casual viewers wouldnt have a clue what the hell was going on. The editing is so jarring. Speaking of the Knightmare sequence As a big fan of Flash it concerns me that I only recognised him because of knowing what Ezra Millers face looks like. What on earth is that mech suit he was wearing and why did they have to obscure his costume with it? I couldnt even see the Flash symbol on his chest  it was probably there but the damn weird clunky mech suit made him look tremendously different from his normal appearance which isnt the best when its his first appearance in this universe and youre trying to make your audience go wow its the Flash! Instead I heard several people beside me whispering that it was Jason Todd. Batman. KILLING. People. gt There is so much I could say about this but I think for the sake of my sanity I will boil it down to a few points. A If Batman killed lowlevel criminals like the thugs he kills in this movie who may have been redeemable people then there is no reason why he wouldnt have killed high level villains like Joker who have constantly shown that they are irredeemable. Joker has already killed Robin and likely countless others and yet he is in prison in Suicide Squad. What? B Batman killing people completely gets rid of any possible moral justification in his going after Superman. It makes him seem petty and vapid which isnt a description Id lend to the worlds greatest detective. C It simply makes him not a hero. Is it badass how terrifying and violent and foreboding Batmans presence is in this movie? Yes. However there is a line with the violence where I cant help but be incredibly concerned that anyone would consider Batfleck a heroic character. Hes a total brutal monster. He brands people and it is specifically pointed out that in prison this is a death sentence skewers them with his grappling hook stabs people in the heart and drags a car containing a dead criminal simply so he can toss it at another. He shoots a guys flamethrower to make him burn to death. Hell he even leads a criminal to crash into a CIVILIAN OIL TANKER. Lets not talk about Jimmy Olsen because Im going to have a fit. Doomsday and Supermans death were not earned. It should have been a massive epic sad moment but it wasnt. That is simply because A we know hes just gonna come right back for Justice League and B you havent managed to show Superman being likeable yet or doing SUPERMAN THINGS like hanging with civilians and being a decent chill dude and ray of happiness and hope so no one is going to care that he died. Now you cant do Death of Superman again so all the stakes in future Superman stories are gone.  Lois Lane. I understand that they want to make her relevant and I really like Amy Adams but ALL of that subplot could have been cut out. It was boring and made the movie drag. Also was it REALLY necessary to have her in the bath in that scene? I cringed so hard that seemed cultivated simply to appeal to the male gaze and to Olay marketing. Zach Snyder doesnt seem to like spending much time with the human alteregos of the superheroes. He seems to see them just as logos as icons and it worries me. These are people and I want to empathise with them but I cant. Partly because... This is such a depressing vaguely nihilistic movie. At every turn we are told how much life sucks and how sad everything is and how humanity is terrible. I understand that has to be a part of it  but they should have emphisized more how Superman refuses to believe that and how he will always combat the cruelty in the world with hope. I know the movie ends on a SLIGHTLY more optimistic note with Bruce wanting the Justice League to be formed so that they can create a better world but it certainly doesnt make for a fun  hours before that point. It makes me concerned that other fun heroes like Flash and Green Lantern will become as dark and brooding as theyve made Superman. Excessive slow motion. Batman and Superman fight for what felt like  minutes in a movie called Batman vs Superman. They do this a good  hours into the movie.  Pretentiousass dialogue at every turn which is utterly convoluted and reads like an attempt to make you feel like youre watching something profound when really you arent. Hope the movie does well because a great DC movie universe would be a dream. Unfortunately this was a pretty badmixed start to it.,DC_Cinematic,d1fp0ya,213,t5_2ykm6

Maybe it could show a MoS type of thing where he is grown and practicing his powers learning how to communicate to sea life and then it goes back to a flashback where his father tries to get in touch with Arthurs mother to ask him who she is and how can their son breathe underwater. Maybe go to present day Aquaman introduce Mera have them talk about the conflict between the Atlantean King Orm and his conflict with land dwellers. Then go back to a flashback of his father dying and him by his side in the hospital crying spend some time on this stage of his life showing how he found his mother his brother how he learned how to be in good terms with both the land dwellers and the Atlanteans maybe show Orm scheming to kill his mother and Arthur is devastated he leaves off Atlantis in the hands of Orm because he doesnt actually find out that Orm killed his mother until near the end of the movie where they fight. They fight because Arthur is trying to stop Orm from starting a war between the two worlds during the fight Arthur figures out that Orm killed their mother and his motivation to kill her he kills Orm and takes his rightful place as king.

The Dark Knight and Captain America  The Winter Soldier are two very good examples of this.  Zack Snyder has proven to be unable to do this.  In part due to the lackluster reception of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman they didnt make as much money as they could have.  And it doesnt require dumbing down the movie it requires making more likable characters and more than that a coherent narrative.At the risk of sounding like a parrot the movie is at a  on RT it has a B on Cinemascore.  Its not like MoS where critics were polarized critics outright heavily disliked the film.  Movies dont get scored that low because no one gets what the directors trying to do.

We have a Superman who can feel and we see him feel pain and loss and yes even death.Not to go super holy roller but MoS was filled with Christ imagery.  Its not as overt in BvS but Batmans line reminded me of St Paul talking about Jesus Christ.  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are. Hebrews .   Were getting a Superman that is human in all but genetics which is incredible.  I like the Reeve movies dont get me wrong but that Superman never stops being an alien.   Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill makes the excellent point about how Clark Kent in the older movies is almost like Superman making fun of or looking down on humanity.  In the Reeve movie he really kind of is.  Hes actually an incredibly weird guy.

7130883,0,t1_d1oeviy,No as someone else said Marvel has a working pipeline thats very well oiled by now while Warner are still finding their footing. Also preproduction and production principle photography on Batman v Superman was WAY expensive so rushing postproduction editing sound visual effects music etc. to meet a summer  release which was initially what they were planning to do would have ballooned the budget to over  million and thats just actual film budget not including anything else marketing etc.Basically the faster you need something the more people you have to throw at it which makes things expensive. Thats really it if you ever wondered why movies are so damn expensive look no further than a films credits and imagine having to pay all those people for months and some even years.So they decided to take their time to keep the budget in check. They were aiming for  million and it looks like they nailed that.Whats crazy is even with an extra  months of postproduction Batman v Superman was still coming in VERY HOT with a lot of VFX shots finished at the last second. But theres an explanation for that too as you might remember they set the movie for a May date but when they pushed that forward to late March that meant the visual effects studios had  weeks less to finish their respective shots. Im actually fairly certain that even if Warner wanted to release the longer  hour Rrated cut they couldnt because I bet the VFX shots in that are NOT finished obviously. Why do you think they released that deleted scene on youtube after the premiere? Because thats when they finished it.Its all crazy believe me this business Hollywood.

7166444,0,t1_d1slqnl,Id make the Red Hood the second batman solo movie and Court of Owls the first one as I think both can be tied together really nicely  bear with meIf it was only me the first Batman solo movie would be Court of Owls Id really like the first half to be about Batman hunting the Owls doing detective work finding connection with the old Waynes legacy finding the nest unveiling the conspiracy of this underground cult while at the same time giving us flashbacks of him doing the same thing for the first time years ago as a kid  him investigating only to fall behind each time cut to him succeeding as an adult to do a juxtaposition and how he grew to be better and how him and Alfred are dealing with the situation of Bruces parents murder. Young bruces parent has been dead for a couple of weeks Bruce is finally getting better but at the price of obsession for this case. Alfred is glad hes finally out of depression but concerned for his mental well being because of the obsession. I would make it so that Alfred is the one who unwillingly encouraged Bruce into this path so he later always felt responsible and ashamed for pushing Bruce into what would later become Batman as he didnt exactly know how to deal with the child. Thats how Bruce feel too that Alfred is responsible for this but hes actually glad he did this as he consider he saved his life when he started helping him in this obsession.The themes. So this is Batman future trying to figure out What is Gotham? or more exactly Who is Gotham? what makes Gotham the city it is which is the main theme of the comic book The court thinks THEY are Gotham Batman thinks HEs Gotham and thus they disband and we weep because we dont care whos the real Pink Floyd we just want another album but I disgress and as such because he questions What is Gotham we see him interacting with Nightwing Red Robin and Batgirl on different cases around the city supposedly linked to the Court of Owls asking them what is Gotham for them and why do they stay in the city even tho its clrearly fucked upDick Gotham is like a friend in need Tim Gotham is a continuous and neverending puzzle and challenge Batgirl Gotham is a reason to be better and surpass yourself things like that  also as always they want to help him but he says its a personal case he must close by himself pushing them away. Now all this is going on as Batman is an adult but while as a child during the flashback hes trying to figure out what is family? What is the Wayne legacy? Who really where his parents and what were they mixed into? Were they good people? Why were they dwelling with bad people? Who is Alfred and what is he for him a friend? a mentor? a butler? But more importantly for Bruce who is he himself and what is he to become? As an adult Bruce is trying to figure what is Gotham as a child hes trying to figure what is Family.Then the second half is Batman cracking the case finding the Court of Owls and this leads to the Court of Owls weird maze psychotrip building into the finale climax of the Talons targeting major people of Gotham. Batman realize he needs the help of Nightwing Red Robin and Batgirl as they protect their targets but the Talons infiltrated Waynes manor Alfred has been a badass and took down a couple of Talons but hes overwhelmed and in danger. They all come together and save him from the flood of Talons. The finale brings the two themes together as Batman realize what Gotham and Family are for him that the two are actually one another and interconnected. These theme will help us bring another realm and dimension of theme with our next film.Cue the end of the movie.Fade in. We see someone putting a red metallic hood. Cut.This would be great because now the next movie Under The Red Hood would actually clash and challenge these themes as Gotham has made one of Bruces Family member an Enemy and Bruce needs to find how to reconciliate all that.TLDR The Court of Owls would be present Batman trying to figure out What is exactly Gotham? or Who is Gotham the flashback of young Bruce working the Court of Owls case would be him trying to figure out What is Family? or Who is Family?. They come clashing together in the final act as BatmanBruce learns that for him Gotham is Family and vice versa. The next movie Under The Red Hood would actually clash and challenge this as Gotham has made one of bruces Family member an Enemy and Bruce needs to find how to reconciliate all that.Side note Since Batman Solo I Court of Owls introduce these themes and Batgirl Id ACTUALLY make Batman Solo II Killing Joke addressing that its the SECOND time Joker has gone too far wink wink and since we saw Batgirl we would actually care I would end it with Joker going to prison instead of having his neck snapped and Batman would crumble the fuck down because we just love our middle movies to be like this wink wink Empire Strikes Back is fucking genius wink wink then Batman Solo III Under the Red Hood would all tie this up together with a great happy ending of all the batfamily eating a victorious fried Banana Ice Cream at the local Victory Fried Ice Cream Shop.   ,DC_Cinematic,d1sr8uf,18,t5_2ykm6

7252895,0,t3_4er9ta,The huge problem here is that Zack Snyder is the most hated director in the critic world and there is a reason. The reason is that he is the best visual director and if he can manage to make and a god story telling then forget about the other director and this bring fear. No one can match his visuals no one but his is lost in trying to put many things in one movie or lost in his mind. All people who have worked with him are just speechless and love him and respect him. I hope he have help for Justice league because I think is his last hope to brake from this point that they put him. Watchmen is the best looking bold groundbreaking CBM ever made ahead of his time.  is another example of a stellar movie he put Gerard in the map. Man of steel is a Superman story told like no other amazing visuals.

Realistically speaking prequel movies which I dislike as a rule would have to be set in the last five years unless youre planning to recast him. I think its fair to say that starting this movie universe with a Batman who is effectively at the end of his career or at least more than half over is disappointing for those of us who find the Batfamily to be the best part of the DC Universe.I mean at this point Bruce is going to be almost ready to recruit Terry by the time that Justice League Part  comes out.gt BvS was already  and a half hours long.

They were brief less than  minutes at most and did a good job of painting Batmans paranoia for people not versed in the comics while chucking the comic book crowd some Easter eggs to boot.But yeah I think there was a lot of unnecessary sub plot. Did holly hunters character really need to be established so much? Was the bullet subplot really necessary when proving Lex was behind the courthouse bombing would have been more than enough of a smoking gun. Did we really have to know who defaced the statue with the false god graffiti. And did they really even need that legless guy to be able to bring a case against Superman? I mean its clear he was going there as a platform to speak for himself rather than to address the guy in the wheelchair. It would have been much easier to show an unknown group graffiti tagging the statue to show its a widespread view and to have Hunters senator go on the news to call out Superman to come and stand trial. He arrives the place blows up before he has a chance to say anything.  minutes becomes .Look at TDK. Its really efficient storytelling. The Mayor the commissioner and the judge arent established in any way because there really isnt any need to. TDK has plenty of subplots but they are dealt with in a quick and effective manner. Do we need to know the back story of that cop who beats the Joker up in the jail for that scene to function?

Having a last name like Kent would imply you were born of or brought into a lineage of humans. Bruces line Youre not even a man isnt literal man or human but what a man represents to him. Bruce sees only criminals to have a lack of fear and having  fear is something he holds to be at the essence of goodness and well intentions. He believes the lack of fear makes you a criminal freak or monster.That line is saying not only are you weak because I have defeated you physically but you arent even aware of what makes ushumans stronger than you. Once he sees that ClarkKal can have fearlosing a loved one and that he overlooked that in his anger it made Bruce too similar to the criminals he defends citizens from. This is what changed his opinion on Superman.Alsoand if I could write this in super huge font I would Superman would never willingly provoke a lethalfight with Batmanyes he was coerced into it but he was openly reluctant to fight. With that point in mind Batman fighting Superman in this movie was and can only be seen as an attempt of COLDBLOODED MURDER. That is whats being overlooked.

7373711,0,t3_4gcdrf,Hi there its cool that your getting involved in the world of DC!And to answer your questions. There isnt really a definitive list of most powerful superherosvillains and mainly it just depends on if a writer over or underpowers a character eg in some books Superman might be able to throw away kryptonite while in other he might notHeres a basic list if you need it .  And Thanos is more Marvels Darkseid   . They dont really end but many books are set when the JLA are older so if you want you could consider that an end.Your best bet if you want to know more about DC is to visit rDCcomics.

If an artist creates something that is meant to be open for interpretation fine. But there are artists that have a specific meaning in mind when they create something.As an example... The scene where Clark walks out for the first time in the suit and there is the broken orb and the intact one... If Snyder didnt purposely not saying he did or did not intend those two objects to be taken that way then the video is just masturbatory. If however Snyder did intend that then thats a different story. The video is very well made and he does bring up a lot of interesting observations. But just because its entertaining and well made doesnt mean that its correct. Unless the creators actually meant for this stuff to be there then the video while entertaining is just mental masturbation. The art World is rife with this type of analysis. And just because it is doesnt mean that every piece of art is open to every interpretation that can be squeezed from it.,DC_Cinematic,d2iog4d,5,t5_2ykm6

7467687,0,t1_d2qybi3,Im not an insider but reading about the various ins and outs of the likely finances Id say BvSs true break even point is a little above MOSs box office and that apparently made about  million profit from its theater run. Im basing this on  million production budget and  million for prints and marketing so round to  million cost. Double it to get the standard box office break even point   million  but then take off product placementadvertising money of say million theyd probably take it off before doubling but for our purposes this way it makes it harder to be in profit which gives us  million box office. Add back on participation points deadline.com assumed about  of gross which puts us back to about  million. A shade over MOSs final box office count.Obviously these are rough numbers  theyll have sold a lot more advertising with two big brands involved  but I wouldnt be surprised if  million wasnt the point that WB started to relax since that would be where theyd come away with a definite profit. I could see them ending with about  million profit quite easily from where they are.  profit from outlay wouldnt be bad.Then we start adding in television rights dvdbluraystreaming sales and merchandising. Remember unlike Marvel Warners own everything. The film is part of a much larger money making machine.

Though I think it was  per car and since the doors swing open when Bats grabs the car so the thugs werent trapped inside the car even looks empty. regarding deaths that can directly be traced to batmans actions. When the car lands on the other it doesnt really crush the the car as much as immobilize it the top doesnt seem to crunch that much. really that brings Bats kill count to only  people.  people at warehouse with batwing. counting grenade that is only  people less than half of keatons.

I boycotted RT after the score they gave MOS I thought and still do that it was a great film. When Critics reacted negatively to BvS I expected MOS all over again. A film they hated that id still like  years later. In a way my anticipation for it went up since I dont care for a lot of the films they rave for.The film had no legs against no competition. MoS had bad legs too not as bad as this but that was a lot to do with the fact it actually had a lot of films opening after it. The legs of BVS werent poor because people were watching something else. They were poor because people preferred to not go to the cinema at all than see it no major films were opening to steal the audience.

Ex tense wonderwoman motif as she checks her email. Nolan consistent minimalistic settings. Nolan also had many quips themes and memorable well thought out lines.

Do M.Night Shamalyan or Michael Bay have bad reputations just because of the online consensus?  Or can filmmakers have a style and hallmarks that are disliked by large quantities of people?  Perhaps they can even make financially successful movies that are regarded poorly by many.  Just some food for thought.,DC_Cinematic,d31rjox,4,t5_2ykm6

7614872,0,t1_d37r8wb,Before we get ahead of ourselves you should know that unlike Superman and Batman Wonder Womans origins and mythos have been retconned rebooted retooled and rewritten more times than Batman gets another sidekick. So it all depends on which version youre going with.Okay but the answer your question simply We dont know the specifics for the movie as it could be an entirely different take.In the original run the Amazons were more scientists than fighters but they were more or less depicted as demigods so by virtue they are just better at everything because they are blessed by the gods.Also in most runs Diana is the only one to have actually been born on Themyschira. The Amazons are the ones we hear from mythology and have had long standing quarrels with armies of men Hercules and Theseus et al before being granted Paradise so most of the warrior Amazons know combat from that and probably seek to keep the art alive.As for reproductionhehwell the most accepted canon is that the Amazons are immortal and have no need to reproduce. Diana was only born by the blessings of the gods. The most recent version of the book started by Brian Azzarello Amazons run out and rape and kill men to reproduce and sell the male children to slavery. Also Diana is boringly another product of Zeus lack of ability to keep it in his pants. As much as the general comic audience love Azzs run his version of Dianas origin and the Amazons more or less directly shat on everything Marston created for the characters origins.EDIT The jet was a part of her mythos until I think the s with Perez I could be wrong Ill have to look back. When they started introducing more Greek mythology into her stories they also gave her the ability to fly on her own. So no need for a jet.

I havent seen Apocalypse yet but I havent really heard anything that makes me not want to see. There were negative reviews but the thing about negative reviews is that all too often they just highlight what is a failure without actually explaining why  or the reason why is completely subjective. Not that Im trying to discount all negative reviews but they do have the problem of not addressing the things they actually liked about the films enough and so they dont reflect the fanbase as well. Conversely I think its easier to address the flaws of a film in review that  overall is still positive.So in short this guy loved Suicide Squad which is good and I really hope I enjoy it.

7768010,0,t1_d3p33ed,That clearly isnt true because Cap has had an actual arc across his  moviesnot really. his character only started developing and changed since TWS.Plenty of critics and fans have criticised the acting MARTHA!they critsized the martha scene but not the acting. show me proof that people critsized the acting.. Batman starts the film as a man who kills and ends the same wayThat isnt character development that is called character change and No he changes. he changes after the martha scene and he doesnt kill anyone after thatevery death in the martha scene was a accident the grenade blowing up and killing the guy was the guys fault and the flamethrower blew up because KGbeast turned it on and doesnt brand Lexthe branding is a death sentence.Superman was a brooding mute space Christ who died for our sins.He changes after the council explosion to the dark broody man you were talking about. Before that we dont actually even get to properly see Superman and Clarkother than the bathtub scene so i cant say and neither can you. at the end also he does change. when he says this is my world you are my world and when Superman sacrifices instead of giving the kryptonite spear to wonder womanwhich would risk her life. But i can agree with you that WW has no character and was there just here for fan service.Batmans character was devloped as we know that he i in guiltthrough the flashbacks to the Wayne Murder he has changed becomre more grumpier etc. With Superman he isnt given loads of time for his character develop. Lex Luthor has some amazing character development though. he hows his superiority his manipulativeness his arrogance and his selfishness. I mean that rooftop scene especially. those directors films have coherent plots that the imagery enhances. lol. David Lynch has coherent plots in his movies? you are the first person who has said that. Lynch needs his plots to be as abstract as possible so that he can enhance his imagery and retards who dont know shit about film CRITICIZE him for an incoherent plot and for placing imagery instead of it. same thing goes for terrence mallick Jodorowsky and many masterful film makers. these people DONT CARE ABOUT PLOT. they care about sending their message through and utilizing the power of film.But here is the thing BvS has a coherent story which was probably fucked up by the films sloppy editing. the imagery is NEVER a substitute for story either. there is the storyplot and the imagery is in the background. boring  minute fight scene against a big monster though Bay is probably a better directorand there you for with more of your biased hate against snyder. Micheal Bay cant even try what Snyder does and the fight scene was like  minutes. keep showing me how biased you are. i can give you problems that BvS ACTUALLY has. problems like doomsday the editing not enough Clark KentSuperman WWs character the inconsistent cinematographyi mean they looked great but the style kept on changing the setup scenes and the bullet plot. that is already  things bad about the movieand i can only see  maybe  of those thing getting solved in the ultimate cut the things you mentioned is the part of the film that saves it from being garbage. the acting is considered to be the best part of the film actually. you can keep your opinion mate but it needs to be justified and you havent given me a real reasonthe reasons you gave have already been countered in other posts and some of the other things you shat on were actually praised.a loveless romance that is PadmeAnakin tier awful CGI etc.I think you are talking about MoS. the love in this film was more natural and didnt even take up time and the cgi was pretty great excluding the one on doomsday. i work in the vfx department so i know. the cgi isnt amazing like the jungle book or warcraft but the animations were great and had actual weight to i and i loved the fire and rain textures.I guess its all just a conspiracy that pretty much every critic hated it then?Every critic didnt hate it but most gave it an average rating. a  on metacritic is called average. a . on RT is called average and a . something on IMDB is called average. there were ups and there were lows. the fact that you are hatching onto every instance to hate Snyder just makes me think of you as a hater and dont call me a defender or a fanboy because i already gave you major things in the film that sucked. i actually agree with most critics and think it average. i think the criticswho are professional and not shitheads like Alfanso Duralade probably agree with me based on the RT and Metacritic score. i am not trying to defend the movie but just dont like that you are hating on to it every chance you get.,DC_Cinematic,d3p5srd,1,t5_2ykm6

I think the point he was trying to make is that you dont necessarily need a rich white guy to direct a batman movie even though the character is a rich white guy. As in as long as whoever is directing understands the character then their race or gender doesnt really matter. Though I would like some diversity in directorial roles for the purpose of diversity and true equal opportunity. I feel like studios dont give women or minorities the same opportunity not out of malicious intent but because the well known proven directors tend to be white dudes due to how things were in the past with the discrimination against women and minorities. ,DC_Cinematic,d3walhm,3,t5_2ykm6

If the movies continue to not just disappoint but be bad overall I will start skipping movies in the theaters until things start changing. Im a huge fan of DC comics shows movies animated movies games. But Im no fanboy. Im not going to continually force myself to spend money on something I dont feel deserves it.

7858107,0,t3_4mumbx,Least favorite The Krypton prologue in MoS. Really got the film off to a bad start for me. Bad exposition from right off the bat. Cheesy th century French aristocracy inspired costuming for the Kryptonian council just really on the nose symbolism there. JorEl being an action guy really bothered me. The concept of putting the codex into Clark and how its an Australopithecus skull? Again very obvious and silly symbolism there. The whole genetic engineering aspect of the Kryptonian society in this film felt half baked to begin with. I feel like the more specific you get with Krypton the less interesting it is. It works best as an abstraction of a utopian society gone bad. But anyway back to JorEl. The whole race against time to launch the ship while fistfighting Zod felt hokey to me an artificial way to get the tension up. But to paraphrase Chris Pratt in Jurassic World the world is about to explode tension enough!. Then weve got space dildo ships Zod being way too overly hammy to Lara I will find him! and the disastrous choice to smash cut from Clarks ship landing to the fishing trawler  denying the audience the scene of Jonathan and Marths Kent discovering the crashed alien and choosing to take him in. Basically the whole sequence is unnecessary was done far better in Superman  and all this information is recapped later in the film by JorEls hologram where it works far better as the audience experiences it with Clark as he learns the information firsthand.Favorite Nothing really comes to mind,DC_Cinematic,d3zblpx,1,t5_2ykm6

7884421,0,t1_d428z2a,gtUnless Supermans hands shoulders and head could grow to protect a whole body....I doubt thats what happened.You missed the part where hes also superspeeding through it all. If his head and shoulders make the initial impact and push through with his hand clearing away any forward debris while the rest of his body shields from anything that might fall on them in that instant of time then thats one way it could have happened to make his assertion a reality. gtYES the terrorist needs to be held accountable for his OTHER crimes in the world courtHague. Smashing him through the wall not only hampers the villagers to get their justice but its an unnecessary action for SUPERMAN.What crimes? Hes actually a rebel general who claims the love of his people so the villagers might see him as an authority figure who protects them from the government. The government that later moved in and started killing those villagers.And this Superman typically doesnt get involved with people beyond rescues. The aftermath of this incident proves that to be a wise policy.gtThe only reason why he used Lois as a hostage was because all his soldiers were killed. There is no more people under his command that can threaten Lois life. Furthermore Superman couldve avoided all of this by simply using his Xray vision and grabbing the terrorist from the wall behind them....similar to what Batman does in the warehouse.We dont know if the private contractors eliminated all of his men. Just the ones in that compound. And youre right Superman doesnt have  years experience on how to deal with armed men.

7887699,0,t3_4nc8tn,I think visually is the most important thing really. Look at how much Quicksilver stole the show in the XMen franchise for example. What The Flash needs to do more than anything is be something visually brilliant which encourages people to check it out. It has to be new fresh and they have the budget and the right character for it. I dont know much of Barry outside of the show and the only Flash I knew before that was Wally from the DCAU. Plus with the other differences listed already visuals are something for the general audience which need to be notched up to . The Flash is probably the first DCEU movie which could use D to its advantage in the best of ways and I want them to try and emulate the Avatar must see cinematic experience vibe. If any of you have been to an IMAX movie you know that IMAX countdown they do at the start? Its essentially a D showcase of what it can do and its sort of how I think the Speedforce should be handled. ,DC_Cinematic,d42nf85,11,t5_2ykm6

So something which needs the blogger to be present to experience.Theyre not the traditional group who get set visits so some trust issues may come into play. Itll be something big yet small enough in details that WB will feel secure accidentally letting in to the wild about JL if one of the bloggers gets over excited NDA or not  old school film journalists have a long term relationship with studios and can be trusted to keep secrets and be fair.

8028477,0,t1_d4igwly,  Opening Prologue ConfirmedLast month we reported Darkseids role in Justice League that occurs in the opening prologue.  years ago Ancient Man the Amazonians and the Atlanteans fought off Darkseid who left behind three motherboxes. We saw concept art in The War Room of Ancient Man The Atlanteans and The Amazonians. It looked pretty damn cool. We also saw the three motherboxes as props on a table  one Atlantean one Amazonian and one belonging to Ancient Man. One motherbox is oxblood red another beige and the other off white. We also saw concept artwork on how the Atlanteans protect their motherbox in an Atlantean structure along with artwork of an Amazonian structure which houses the Amazonian motherbox. The motherboxes kind of remind me of the Lament Configuration puzzle box from the Hellraiser series.Edit Theres also this small bit from Birth.Movies.Death. We learn about these boxes in a scene called the History Lesson. That scene according to the art we saw will feature an ancient Atlantean king Hippolyta of Therimysca some old fashioned humans and the god of all gods Zeus himself.,DC_Cinematic,d4ih5ay,7,t5_2ykm6

8039685,0,t1_d4jnz1i,I think the problem ultimately with the idea of Batman and Superman fighting is that a fully powered Superman can kill Batman with ease and a kryptonite weakened Superman would be killed by Batman in seconds too. The idea of them fighting with neither of them trying to genuinely kill the other would be impossible to sell.The start of the fight in the UC is actually the best way for them to tackle that problem. Superman has no desire to fight Batman but has to try and reason with him because his mothers life is in the balance. Batman is hell bent on killing Superman and completely ignores his attempts to speak to him. Whats crucial in the UC is how it plays out compared to the theatrical. Ill not spoil it but for me it totally changes the dynamic of Supermans character in the fight. The dastardly way Lex has pulled all the strings to put Superman into a frame of mind to be drawn into a fight with Batman is the main difference in the UC. And for me that makes Superman a tragic victim rather than a moody teenager.People might not like how the fight was finished but Ive not seen many people complaining that the fight itself didnt make sense. Although some people think the kidnapping of Martha was a cheap plot device it certainly gives a stronger context for Superman to struggle with the threat of Batman.,DC_Cinematic,d4jqi67,1,t5_2ykm6

8052100,0,t1_d4l4dgc,ok heres a few really obvious ways.. The customrare wheelchair would only be available to a select few people.  Its likely only manufactured by a single company in this case LexCorp.. Lex brought him to the Senate hearing and would have been seen by someone. he was sat next to a LexCorp employee during the hearingThey would have know the design was specialized and based off that could easily find the manufacturedesigner and again based on that find out who they were soldgiven to and by whom.  If it was specially made for that one guy there would have to be designs somewhere.  If he literally invented it out of thin air for this one person and one purpose then they could still link materials used to LexCorp or again the presence of Lex and his employees at a hearing where an extremely high tech wheelchair exploded.  One of the first questions asked would be who has the technology to make this? and anyone in the room with the connections would implicate their employer as a high level suspect merely by their presence.They make a point of suggesting the wheel chair is an advanced designspecial so its highly unlikely another company made it but even if they did that makes it even easier to trace back to Lex as that company would have a record of all sales including one to Lex or someone connected to Lex.  Again his presence as well as that of his staff at the hearing would again further implicate him in connection to the bombing.,DC_Cinematic,d4l4qzt,1,t5_2ykm6
8052138,0,t1_d4kvrpq,Yeah I knew that from watching the TC but in the UC it really seems like it is a more present issue and explains Lexs motives from the desert scene and more. Im extremely surprised about the amount of important scenes that were cut. from what Ive read it gives Lex more room to breath and his motives seem much clearer. Even the communion scene I cant seem to grasp why that was cut if Steppenwolf is really the main antagonist for JL. that absolutely baffles me that they would cut that connection from the movie. for example Thanos in GotG even though he didnt play a massive role in the film just his presence gives viewers a idea of whats to come and would make the Darkseid connection at the end a lot more clear. I wish this was the cut the general audience was able to see cause Im not sure how many of the people that hated BvS will actually go out and buy the UC. which seems like it really fleshes out the story and gives the main plot more time to breath because as much as I personally understood the desert scene as the instigator I can see how a lot of people found it a vague and unimportant scene. But in reality it was probably the most important. My only hope if that DC doesnt lose hope and keeps making the movies they set out to make and not let the studio make unnecessary adjustments to an amazing film.,DC_Cinematic,d4l4wjf,1,t5_2ykm6

The TC was great to me but the UC and what it has added solidifies the things I grasped in the original and have been arguing was there. This is an adult comic book movie that is just as much a thriller type movie as it is a summer blockbuster superhero movie which I feel people dont recognize and its pretty awesome. I think people have gotten used to every movie being family friendly which is demonstrated by Reddits love for every Disney and Pixar movie. This isnt a movie for your kids like Marvel produces. This is an adult adaptation similar to the Nolan trilogy that is meant to be enjoyed at its fullest as a mature take on characters that late twenties and early thirty somethings grew up with.

8168334,0,t1_d4y65lb,Yeah thats definitely a distinct possibility. I actually mentioned that theory briefly in my post. While I think thats one explanation I just feel like Clark was trying not to explicitly link Martha to himself. He had no reason to believe Batman would show the mother of an alien any mercy. For all he knew Batman would treat her as a complicit actor in Supermans sins just like Lex did. I think Superman was instead trying to appeal to Batmans core principle to protect the innocent. After learning what he did over the course of his arc Superman believed that reminding Batman of the consequences of his actions the death of a civilian namely one named Martha would cut through the hatred that was fueling his mission and help him see reason. But both interpretations are really interesting to discuss!,DC_Cinematic,d4ylasb,1,t5_2ykm6

More frames is also why live sports broadcasts look more real than movies on TV.If they plan to do slow motion for Flash theyll probably get a camera with a much higher frame rate and slow that down to .  isnt very much for slow motion my phone can shoot  but stuff like the Phantom Flex can do amazing things like shooting over  fps.

I mean people could have started a church or Superman and that wouldnt be illogical but they didnt. The only people to refer to Superman as a god are Bruce and Lex. Im not saying the metaphor doesnt fit from a narrative perspective. But in terms of the way the characters treatthink of Superman it does not fit. Also to be fair Superman does not have God powers Dr Manhatten did. Superman comes from a race of equally powered people and has a weakness and well as limites powers. Dr Manhatten can literally bend any matter to his will. Organic inorganic doesnt matter the earth literally rests in the palm of his hand. If he wanted something he could make it so. Superman has never been that powerful which is why as I said earlier the God allegory makes sense more in Watchmen than in BvS. ,DC_Cinematic,d58ahue,1,t5_2ykm6

8265146,0,t1_d5abxk2,Exactly Batman has always been this just with his killer instincts edited out. No killing doesnt equal good Osama Binladen was killed and most people think that was a pretty good thing. Batman actually does a number of things as bad or worse then killing criminals.He embezzles billions of dollars from his company to buy everything he could ever possibly use to fight crime. He has a military class jet and a tank and a sub and a boat and a helicopter various motorcycles a supercomputer and a satellite. The Nolan movies touch on this a bit he sets up a shell corporation to hide him buying bat hats. He snatches up all the military tech his company makes and no just because he owns the company doesnt mean hes entitled to a millions of dollars of that companies assets. Then when the lawyer guy figures him out he says hes been pouring money into the applied sciences department. If you want to know why Metropolis is so much nicer then Gotham its probably because Lex Luther always makes a profit on his extra curricula so his company grows and can create jobs.Then theres all the torture Batman commits. Its kind of strange that torture is unethical even in wars which view killing as completely but Batmans morality is the reverse. He never kills but tortures people all night long because I guess hes above the Geneva Convention. They never show it but there must be times where he picks up a minor criminal that honestly doesnt know anything about a supervillain plot. In those cases when does Batman realize his torture victim doesnt know anything important judging by the extremely driven nature of Batman its probably hours. So does he drop that guy at GPD beaten crying missing fingernails and with electricity burns on his testicles or does he tell him to keep quiet about it and just leave to find his next informant.And of coarse theres the strange fact that Batman at some point must have watched a documentary about child soldiers and thought to himself You know thats not a bad idea. He picks up traumatized orphans who have just lost their parents and tells them if they follow him they can get vengeance and justice against the kind of people who took them away. Thats something a Somali warlord would say not a hero. He even refers to them as his soldiers and they pay the price. Jason Todd gets murdered Barbra Gordon is paralyzed in Batman Beyond Tim Drake is tortured and brainwashed by the Joker. Even Dick Greyson is probably covered in scars and has seen friends and colleagues die in front of him or betray him. Also its supremely fucked up that Batman is known for his stealth and his outfit reflects that being black and gray and sometimes dark blue but he dresses his robins in bright red lime green and yellow. Sometimes he doesnt even give them pants and he never gives them proper head protection it really seems like he wants them dead.Tldr Batman is responsible for things just as bad or worse then killing. He isnt a good guy.,DC_Cinematic,d5ap8nv,2,t5_2ykm6

Its not that he isnt proud that he saved someone you get a wonderful sense of humility and nobility in Cavills Superman when he saves people. its just as reflective as anyone you see in the armed service which Cavill supports and can draw from.If I rescued someone from a burning building the last thing I would do is smile for myself such a self involved thing to do,DC_Cinematic,d5ga43i,3,t5_2ykm6

8342248,0,t1_d5jc2bg,Personally I felt like Doomsdays inclusion made sense from a storytelling standpoint.  Even though the movie was called Batman v. Superman it was inevitable that they were going to resolve their differences and team up by the end otherwise it would be tough to have a Justice League movie.It would be really a really anticlimactic ending if they only had Lex Luthor to deal with seeing as either one of them could deal with him effortlessly once his plans were exposed and unlike somebody like Venom in SpiderMan  Doomsday doesnt have much if anything in the way of characterization or backstory so he works well as a big threat to throw at the heroes to show them working as a team.Plus it led to this shot which was the highlight of the movie for me.

But he just isnt the Lex I have grown to know sort of like Ledgers Joker.I think what would have knocked it out of the park for me personally is if they renamed him to be a original character and save the more regal businessmen Luthor for a later film. ,DC_Cinematic,d5no2j1,1,t5_2ykm6

So he showed who was when he was trying to make it look like an accident.How did Tony never find the files that Zemo found that made him think the Winter Soldier was involved in his parents death? We saw in Avengers  that Tony has no qualms about digging through Shields files so when they were leaked by Natasha why didnt he look at them?The one I mentioned that they never explain how Tony knows Peter is Spiderman. And Tony wanted the Accords because a teenager died but yet he takes an untrained child to an all out superhero brawl?Ant Man has terrible motivation for joining the fight.

8480906,0,t1_d61jf47,Regarding Faracis Fresh rating for SS I think that exposes the real problem with Rotten Tomatoes. It has nothing to do with any bias among critics. Given that reviews are opinion pieces the concept of bias is practically meaningless. It has to do with the false dichotomy of Fresh and Rotten.In Faracis review he describes the film as a total mess but there were things he enjoyed about it. Those things ended up perhaps just barely tipping the film over into Freshness. So his decidedly mixed review ends up represented in RT in exactly the same way as a total rave.Thats a problem with Rotten Tomatoes not Faraci.,DC_Cinematic,d61nnow,12,t5_2ykm6

8488313,0,t1_d62i9mk,I think that perhaps DC films could be seen in a better light years from now but they wont ever be cult films.Cult films are movies that have a passionate following but arent appreciated by everyone. While that currently describes the DCEU there are other aspects that define a cult film. James Bond movies can never be cult because they appeal to everyone on a basic level. While a bad James Bond movie might appeal to very few the basic franchise appeals to most its a blockbuster. If Batman and Superman arent viewed as blockbusters I dont know what to say. Another aspect of cult films is that they are genre films b movies and usually cheap. BvS and Suicide Squad are neither of those things. Additionally the cult behind the film has to be small. BvS underperformed but it made over m. Its like saying Transformers has a cult following. It doesnt those movies are popular. ,DC_Cinematic,d62l3va,10,t5_2ykm6

8512203,0,t3_4vyeka,I just got out of a morning showing. Overall it is meh. Poor execution and poor choice of antagonist drag this down to a level below the theatrical cut of Batman v. Superman.The positives are the casting was solid. Waller reminded me of the timmverse version in her tone and in her demeanor. Margin Robbie did great as Harley the trailers really dont show it but she does have the harleys accent just toned down somewhat. I loved the easter eggs especially in Harleys background and the wardrobes looked good. The appearance of Flash and Batman had an appropriate amount of screen presence and I really really hope dont fuck up Justice League.Problem is there are a lot of negatives. Enchantress and her army of asphalt soldiers feels very generic plot wise. CinemaSins and Screen Junkies are going to have a field day. Enchantresss brother looks like a discount version of the Annihilator from Thor. Waller had one scene which felt out of place where she straight murders government agents. Waller plays dirty but at the end of the day everything she does is to help the USA so shooting agents on your side felt out of character. Unlike Heath or Ben Jared Letos performance was not a home run that would silence critics. I found the Tattoos overkill still and plot wise he wasnt needed. His part could have been cut out for all except Harleys origin and the movie would have moved along like it did. I also didnt like how he actually cared for Harley. It felt very Un Joker like. At most Harley is an amusing plaything for him that he would discard the moment she becomes inconvenient.  That said I did like the street gangster take on him. Had he been the main antagonist rather then enchantress I think that would have made a very compelling movie compared to what we saw.Overall Im not buying when its on blu ray unless its part of a bundle or bargain bin cheap. .,DC_Cinematic,d65kzop,2,t5_2ykm6

You dont go through the expense of composing and recording music for  minutes of film that you arent planning to release.

8532070,0,t3_4wkt92,All this is confirming is that there will definitely be an extended cut on bluray. Those scenes arent just randomly thrown together... which Ayer could easily have done. You can tell theyre already edited and ready to go in full final picture quality just like the rest of the movie. Even if theyre little snippets they are edited like they would be in the movie. Makes sense regardless. Warner Bros. was really happy with the success of BvS UE this way it makes people buy their bluray because its a completely different movie and they know people will buy it just for that. Its scummy but it also makes the fanbase happy. Its a two way thing. Of course its WBRs fault in the first place for having multiple cuts since they fuck with their movies.Either way theres about a  chance thisll have an extended cut on bluray or well get all the deleted scenes as a seperate feature. One things for certain we are definitely eventually going to see these scenes one way or another. But Im gonna stick with a completely new cut of the movie most likely called the David Ayer Cut or Directors Cut with the bluray. Dont think itll be R Rated like BvS but itll be a different cut of the movie. Whether its better than the movie is now well find out. Which isnt saying much since I think the movie is damn good.

8540150,0,t1_d68iw0c,Thats not quite how it works. First of course advertising costs have to be factored in. All costs are factored in equally. Where the confusion arises is in box office receipts. Movie studios dont receive  of the money a movie makes in theaters because the theaterowners also get a percentage. Typically in the US its a    split but in China the theater owners get  of the box office. This is where the movies need to double their production costs to break even idea comes from.Suicide Squads production budget was reported at  milliion originally and then reshoots were tacked on that made it cost more. Who knows how much more but the reshoots werent cheap. Then theres the cost of advertising. Ive also heard  million for this but who knows if thats an accurate figure. Lets assume between production cost including reshoots and advertising that the total budget for Suicide Squad was  million. In that case you could broadly say that it would have to roughly make  million at the box office to break even. But again the studio doesnt always get a  share of the box office. In some countries the studio share is less. I will agree though that DC would be foolish to put out a Suicide Squad movie that needed say a billion to break even.  million is already pushing it. Maybe the total budget including reshoots and advertising is closer to  million. In that case it would only need about  million at the box office give or take to break even. Success isnt only measured by box office take though. Home video is still an important source of revenue and so is licensing. ,DC_Cinematic,d6934v3,2,t5_2ykm6

Youre just being insincere if you lump all user reviews of BvS and SS with fan boys. Youre actually exhibiting the same thing youre criticizing on your high pony. In fact if the vast majority of reviews are from DC fan boys then guess what? That means DC fan boys are the majority of people who watch the films. Which means critics are simply bad barometers of what the fans of these films want. SS is making a ton of money. If its being funded by DC fan boys as seems to be the underlying implication I keep seeing then clearly trashing the film and trying to deliberately affect its business by saying if you watch or like this film youre a moron will warrant a reaction from said fan boys.Its not people failing to handle opposing views.

I believe most of us felt the same except for a select few like my brother who got it during his first watch. But when you do realize it it transcends to a powerful moment.

8674935,0,t3_4ys0pl,I think that Both Knightmare sequences and the Flash Cameos are needed. The JL email just shouldnt have been emails. And you are wrong. Every other scene in the movie is needed. I would love if somehow Doomsday can be deleted from the movie but its impossible. It should have been much better if Bruce was done with the fighting and Sups says that Lex is behind all of this. The Knightmare sequence shows that if Bats and Sups let Lois die Clark will go insane.The future will be the one in the Knightmare scenes. But if Bruce finds all the metahumans and stops Lex this is not going to happen. So now the Knightmare sequence is the old future. Where Lois died a Superman goes insane and there is war between the metahumans. But because of Flash now thats not happening and BruceDiana are together to form a team. Bruce knows all of this now so the future will be with Justice League and no with war between the superheroes and insane Superman.

Everyone who bought Batman v. Superman has a copy of the special.  Magazine circulation is much smaller.Im not saying DCEU hasnt been adopted.  Thats where the bias is coming from.  People with DCEU Facts twitter accounts and the like not wanting to let go even after DC Films tells them to.Its a little like some fans continuing to call it Star Wars Anthology even after it was officially branded A Star Wars Story... or refusing to call it Legends in favor of Expanded only without decades of being called Expanded and with Expanded actually being official unlike Extended.Not expecting it to change but people are factually wrong if they call DCEU official.  There is no trademark.  It doesnt matter if an article writer though it was cute to put a TM next to it.  A trademark only works if you market it.  Thats how DC lost exclusivity to Captain Marvel in the first place.Nowhere is DCEU in official costly expensespaid marketing.  Yet Justice League Universe is.

8792098,0,t1_d74nm0x,Yeah its a pity that it didnt come across more. If youve scene the transcript of the newspaper article headlines in Wallys apartment its clear that the writers know about this side of the story. Theres headlines about him shifting tectonic plates to stop an earthquake but also contrasted with a story about him saving a homeless man from starving in the woods. They get what hes supposed to be but wanted to focus on him as a victim in BvS to build up Lex and Bruce as characters. Its why the saving montage isnt really hopeful because its supposed to be about the tone of the voice overs rather than the joy of saving and being saved. They didnt want to weaken the anti Superman rhetoric with too stark a juxtaposition. I understand and respect that decision because its actually well thought out. Its not in any way lazy. But I still think it would have been nice to see that contrast between the symbol of hope and the symbol of fear Lex tried to make him. The best you get to seeing the contrast is in the UE when the little boy is watching the burning of Superman effigies on the news. It would have been great if hed been running around pretending to be Superman or flying a doll in the earlier scene when the mother was talking to Clark.,DC_Cinematic,d74ot7v,3,t5_2ykm6

8825451,0,t3_50zco9,Youre taking it out of context hes talking about the movies where Batman kills people all the time with explosions and the sort and the audience doesnt usually perceive this as Batman directly killing someone. He isnt saying that Tim Burton invented that Batman doesnt kill he invented the idea that Batman is perceived as someone who doesnt kill but then has him blow up and shoot a bunch of people.The problem with this interview in my opinion is he gave it the day before the movie came out and if youre going to utilize a psychological trick on the audience to make them miss that Batman just blew up some guys you shouldnt tell them in advance. He should have just let the movie stand on its own at that point not give a last minute interview to Stefan Pape.Funny though this same interview at  he talks about his way of combating the idea of Superman being so perfect and allpowerful that he becomes boring is to have his best intentions go awry in ways he doesnt expect. I always thought the way to try and combat that is to sort of show really the result of being a boy scout in some ways. Trying to do the right thing can also be a disaster.I wish more people would realize that particular aspect of BvSthat the result of good intentions isnt always going to be happiness and the idea of no good deed goes unpunished isnt something to gloss over. Doing the right thing isnt always going to be easy or lead to success which is a basic concept I think seems to be missed by a lot of people who hate this film.,DC_Cinematic,d78p3v9,1,t5_2ykm6

8885111,0,t3_51yfnp,Relevant infoltSpeaking of the movie I know you enjoyed it. Why did it work for you what could have been better and what do you say to the fans or critics who didnt respond? And is it a problem when these movies have big openings but dont stay strong on subsequent weekends?Well theres almost always a dropoff these days in my opinion. How big is the potential audience and did most of them see it the first weekend? That said the movie has been No.  at the box office for three weeks.If someone a fan or a critic didnt like it then thats their opinion and I have no problem with that so long as they went into the movie theater with an open mind. As Ive said elsewhere some critics had an agenda Im sick of these superhero movies!In some cases I wonder if they saw the same movie that I did.I give the movie a good solid three stars. Not perfect by a long shot but fun interesting and it keeps your attention. It worked for me because it had the essential Squad DNA  bad guys forced to do covert ops for the government.I liked the characterization in the films and some  such as Will Smith Margot Robbie and Viola Davis  stood out although I will say there was no one that I didnt like. There were some plotholes here and there and the main plot was a we have to save the world story that felt generic to me. We didnt do that in the comic much War Crimes doesnt have that kind of plot. But overall I really enjoyed the film Ive seen it three times so far.If you were to pitch a movie sequel what squad members would be in it and which of your plotlines from the original run would you love to see adapted or borrowed from?Of course Id have the Unholy Trinity  Waller Deadshot Boomerang.  Flag. Harley  absolutely. I liked Killer Croc. Id add Bronze Tiger and Nightshade  real useful characters. As for which of my plotlines  honestly I dont know. An adaptation of the Jihad the super villain team of terrorists renamed The Onslaught could be interesting although Im not sure you could do it these days. Having the Squad go up against the Justice League would be interesting although thats a lot of characters. Actually the plot of War Crimes would work pretty well I think. I dont know Id like to see what they came up with and maybe use some of these stories as reference rather than a direct adaptation.,DC_Cinematic,d7fv5c5,4,t5_2ykm6
8885372,0,t1_d7fu7hu,Well it did last longer then most people gave it credit for meaning there was enough people to sustain it over the years. For those who ship them I think thats good enough a little shake is good so we can dive into new aspects of the characters. Afterall look at Dick Graysons history. A universally loved character with different fans liking different parts of him. Robin Nightwing or Batman? Teen Titans or Bat Family? DickBabs or DickFire? Theyre all valid and they all had time in the spotlight. Writers take chances to see which ones stick which are fun and which are both. So lets not argue about what should be the end all be all for characters who will have many MANY more adventures to come.,DC_Cinematic,d7fw9yf,3,t5_2ykm6

He notices Superman and that makes him go crazy. You can also tell by the way Doomsday looks at the statue the city made in Supermans honor. He has this look of disgust. He then proceeds to grab Superman and purposely throws him through that same statue destroying it.Again he wasnt a brainless brute and I thought it was pretty interesting that Zods consciousness was brought back into Doomsday. ,DC_Cinematic,d7indh6,4,t5_2ykm6

He embodies what his  fathers teach him the strength from one and the compassion from the other who he truly is as a savior of mankind while keeping a side of himself a secret be mindful and live a normal life. Both of them still see him as inspiring and hopeful to peopleeven mama kent has that sweet flashback to where papa kent sees Clark pretending to wear a red cape and striking his iconic pose .I might not be very good at explaining this but thats clearly what the movie works towards by the end.

And the end of each have that Superman two second musical intro. Then with the very last one just before release focus on Steppenwolf. Make him a real force of evil and devastation. Unstoppable. Have the heroes do some cool moves  in the middle not the WW intro that really spoiled the majestic moment BvS. And then show Steppenwolf and his army or whatever he is using causing serious damage. Do the escalation music....... Dramatic silence. Then cut to black. Justice League logo. Then Superman ding ding intro. Then his silhouette like face within the black screen.

9101551,0,t1_d85ow7z,Then maybe hold off on all the Jesus imagery until he earns it.But honesty can you tell me what MoS is about? Because I cant figure it out. It looks nice. Its got some good actors in it. It has nice moments especially the flying scene. But what was it about? Was it about remembering your roots? The whole holographic dad thing would have you believe that. But Superman doesnt succeed until he rejects the past. Was it about moving on from the past then? Well it cant be because so much emphasis is placed on the past. The whole movie is about the past. His dead dad feeds him information. His other dead dad tells him to let kids die in a flashback. The big emotional climax of the movie is about things that happened in the past. So I just cant figure out what they were trying to say about the character. Hes never anything but burdened by helping others so why does he? When Superman is written well its his motivation thats at the forefront. But this version doesnt seem to have much of a reason. Both of his parents tell him not to help others if he doesnt want to which is just odd for this character. Where did he get his altruism from? And maybe thats why people constantly compare it to other iterations. Because this one doesnt have a solid characterization and so were left clamoring for something else. ,DC_Cinematic,d85uzo2,10,t5_2ykm6

Theyre simple a father and a mother that know some people will hate their son no matter how good his intentions are. They dont want see their son suffer.Except thats not true. His father explicitly states that its not about our lives or the lives of those around us. gt Him not being burdened and being confident from the start is not believable. Thats when you have to ask yourself where did he get his altruism from?From his parents. Thats always been where it came from. You say he grew on this planet and that make him altruistic then say that both his parents  who also grew up on this planet  are allowed to not be altruistic.

However in doing so the filmakers may end up getting cornered story wise. It brings up the whole question of If Flash can move that fast why doesnt he always win why is the Justice League needed? Etc. Prime example of this was Xmen Days of Future Past. Quicksilver rescues Magneto from prison and then straight up saves Erik amp Charles a couple of minutes later. He was so OP that he had to be written out of the movie. The only reason this didnt happen in Xmen Apocalypse was because they had a villain that could beat him.

9128659,1,t3_55b2mr,Well I dont particularly care for any of these movies. Man of Steel is fine enough I think Cavill is easily the weakest link. Michael Shannon is a bit to over the top for my tastes but thats just me BvS is a bad movie. I know Im in the minority here in thinking so thats fine but I disagree. Affleck is great and Fishburne and Irons are both pretty entertaining but everything else is either a so dull or b so over the top. I dont get the praise for Eisenberg here. Maybe Im just legitimately stupid and am missing something but I feel like thats not it. Cavill is even worse in this movie hes just so dull Adams is given nothing to do. Gal Gadot is fine but Im still not sold. She may be good she may not. I like the warehouse fight thats it. All the other action sequences are so stupid or just look fake the batmobile chase looks so fake. Everything involving Doomsday is completely horrible. I like the sequence with Supermans funeral but its too early in the series for me to care. The problem is definitely Snyder. You know the whole moments gt scenes thing Im sure youve seen the video. Suicide Squad is a mess. Maybe the original cut was better maybe not. Jared Leto is embarrassing. Will Smith is great. Everyone else is just somewhere in the middleThese are my opinions. If you disagree fine. Please no one try to persuade me otherwise I dont want to debate anymore,DC_Cinematic,d894g6j,-1,t5_2ykm6
9130932,0,t3_55az4g,Critical reception wont matter much going forward. Its simple. DCEU films have a huge following. The fans are putting up a resistance. And because the critical opinion has been by and large uncalled for and over the top theres going to be a growing distrust of critics. It doesnt matter what you think about critical opinion. The point is a lot of people were up in arms with SS reviews. This after the controversy of BvS and critics. Which is very strange in my opinion. BvS is a film critics should not have bashed so hatefully. Why? Because it tried to be as artistic and unique as possible. But the manner in which they bashed the film created a problem for them with how people view their opinions on DC films. I personally felt SS was an awful film. Had the critics been less hateful in their criticism of BvS their opinion would still be relevant going forward in terms of the DCEU. Its a strange situation. And it could be a blessingcurse for DC going forward. Because audiences really liked SS and the critics decided to once again hatefully murder it the results backfired. Especially given how that drama really played out week in week out in the media. You cant deny the anti DC rhetoric that was the trademark of every news article. And the mini civil war between bloggers and other media personalities. Some trying very hard to trash the film and others calling them out. It was a circus. And this will only fuel the distrust among general movie goers. The very fact that its a big point of discussion ARE CRITICS BIASED AGAINST DC? is not good news for critics. Because no matter what your opinion is this is one of the big debates in the comic book film culture. And given how the reviews since MoS dont match with public opinion in general and how well the films are doing at the box office and home video it could end up being untenable. I thought SS reviews were exaggerated but a bit closer to reality for me at least. But the backlash from fans and the incredible domestic and international demand that film has will cause a lot of people to think twice before trusting critical reviews for DCEU films. Which means if they trash WW again very few people will believe them. Even if it is not so good. Same goes for Justice League. Critics put themselves in a position that hastens their demise and reduces their relevance because of their hyperbole and sensationalism. And given how media trust within the public is at an all time law critics surely didnt help themselves this year. ,DC_Cinematic,d89etf8,1,t5_2ykm6

9154853,0,t3_55knqi,Issue was characters acting like established ones when they werent. Like Batman. Its the first time we see him we dont really know this version of him but movie wants you to act like you do know him. There is a whole  mins intro about him dumbass as much as i love that  mins cause how majestic and beautiful it looks I have to say that it added nothing to the movie. If that  mins was actually something about how Batman turned out to be this I dont give fuck anymore who cares if some of these guys die person it would be much much better. I know things from his past somewhat implied here and there but this isnt comics. You cant just imply it you have to show it. If you dont all I have is a dead Robin about whom I really dont care and a grieving Batman whose grieving is something I dont care cause I dont really know the connection between him and the person he grieves.And this doesnt go just for Batman. WW felt like guest star. Lex was different but again movie wants you to know why he hates Supes before watching the movie.Supes was great tho. I dont know why people got so messed up with all that middle east bit tho. Everything was really clear about that.I wish we had another solo Supes movie before this. Or a solo Batman movie in which we see a cameo of Lex. Like an introduction or smt. Then BvS would work how it was really planned. Other than timing of the movie I really dont see a big issue just small ones fixable ones.,DC_Cinematic,d8cfzft,1,t5_2ykm6

9183257,1,t3_563mu1,Ok the editing may be an issue but the biggest problem is definitely writing. I say this as a big DC fan Im disappointed with these plots that make little sense. BvS had The potential to be the greatest superhero movie of all time but unfortunately that didnt happen. Suicide squad could have been amazing but a weak villain that could have been an ally ruined that. I just want a storyline with some depth to it something that will make you think about it for a long time after youve watched it. Im not sure if Justice League will be the answer to that but with Ben Affleck taking a bigger role in production there is potential. Editing is nowhere near the biggest problem. BvS ultimate edition promised to make the movie better but it added very little to the plot. Im very excited for what is coming and I hope that the DCEU has learned from its mistakes. The key to this is having an engaging and complex storyline.,DC_Cinematic,d8g1n2j,5,t5_2ykm6

9195618,0,t1_d8hg6z7,I dont put much store on RT scores as an arbiter on greatness since it rewards being generic in the mainstream but Ill grant you this since I like Wright.The email scene is an obvious WB requirement and shouldnt be blamed on Snyder. Im pretty sure Wright would have done the same if it means he gets to make the rest of his film as he liked it. Thats just pragmatic business.WRT the Knightmare sequence Im going to say I dont get why people dont understand the relevance of it in this film. It is a representation of Bruces fears of what might happen that is driving him throughout the film that it also gives Easter eggs to comic book fans and potentially sets up a link to future films should not be regarded as a negative.If people were complaining about the Manbat sequence theyd have more of an argument since it doesnt add to whats already been said by Alfred and the initial voiceover and is not greatly important to the overarching character arc.,DC_Cinematic,d8hm1x9,1,t5_2ykm6

9216257,0,t3_56l671,Well we are talking about big Hollywood studios they would rarely come out and admit their own mistakes it would be handled internally. Also WBDC need to have more balls and learn to commit to a directors original vision.... the fact is they have Snyder the go ahead for the story he was telling and when he made the movie they end up chopping it up really affecting the narrative of the story. For Suicide Squad Im sure there were changes made to the film post BvS cause the first look we got for it at comic con was so different tonally so if I were to make an educated guess WB really changed things up somewhere along the process. Point being just stick to your guns rather than making snap reactive decisions just to pander to the crowd or do what you think will be mainstream cause that ends up not working most of the times. Focus on the story being told and the directors vision and just give input and notes for things that could go against future movies or things that have already been set up.Hopefully with JL things change and the way its being handled so far has shown me that there has definitely been changes up top which would be Berg and Johns coming in as things just seem to be more under wraps and low key compared to BvS. As for WW........ I really hope they do not try to change things now just let Patty finish what she started. We do know Geoff had a hand in it and he did get promoted when it was still filming so we have the new heads Berg and Johns in charge whilst WW is in post currently unlike BvS and SS. ,DC_Cinematic,d8k88va,2,t5_2ykm6

We have a man who run fast A man from the oceans A goddess A alien A half man half robot and a guy in a bat suit fighting along side these people. Humor brings out personality relatability and takes away the silliness of these characters.

Im saying the numbers make it a very flawed system as a mediocre film easily has a better score on Rt than a polarizing one but thats besides the point here. What im trying to argue is the fact the casual audience shouldnt go into RT looking at the score and measure a films quality solely based on that score. Im very well aware of the numbers and what they mean I know what it means purely on the RT scale and consensus of the website. Im arguing people miss judge and missread what they should take away from it. Thats the real argument here. People shouldnt look at it and see what the better movie is based on a percentage if the argument lends itself to talk about criticism overall people should actually read the reviews and take said percentage as a basis for how likely they will like the film.,DC_Cinematic,d8vrdp5,3,t5_2ykm6

9478163,0,t1_d9gtqv5,If I can throw my own thought in here I think there certainly has been a problem with narrative structure in all three films released so far. Its not just that the second and third acts are rushed its also that every film has relied heavily on nonstandard storytelling. Whether Man of Steels many flashbacks or BvSs numerous montages the people behind these films seem to shun straightforward storytelling. That becomes a bigger problem when you have directors who dont get how to balance action and drama. I recently watched Doctor Strange whose origin is somewhat similar to Bruces in Batman Begins. Doctor Strange had this precise issue it jumped from drama to action in a way that felt rushed and unsatisfying. Snyders biggest fault in both MOS and BvS is that he opted for narrative shortcuts Clarks upbringing Batmans career instead of a substantive narrative.So I agree that this is a huge problem and it comes down to a need for better writers and directors who are good at telling stories. I will also submit that there is something to be said about staying true to the comics not at all about tone. Obviously a very different medium but those stories did resonate for a reason. When you stray too far and have all these other technical problems it leads to sharp criticism.Bottom line the DCEU needs better storytellers.,DC_Cinematic,d9hdyyi,1,t5_2ykm6

9485542,0,t3_5aorte,I never saw Superman reaffirm his role as a hero for the people of earth after the senate bombing. Its always been Martha and Lois that truly grounds him and keeps him tethered to earth. The line where he says This is my world. youre my world pretty much sums it up. Youre talking about Superman sacrificing himself for humanity in a way he does but it is only as an extension of Lois. Its really a matter of perspective really if really superman cares for humanity as a whole or if he is infatuated with the idealistic view of humanity which  in some ways Lois character does embody through her selflessness. She has protected Clark at the threat of losing her job and getting into trouble with the government when she wont reveal Supermans identity and also when she risked drowning to retrieve the spear.But Clark never really finds that sense of fulfilment with helping people. Even in this film I never got that sense even in his sacrifice. It has always been Lois or Martha that drives him. But nobody else really.,DC_Cinematic,d9iaono,3,t5_2ykm6

9490161,0,t1_d9i9p02,See I disagree with that assessment. I dont think BvS accomplishes an emotional impactful death because what it shows doesnt actually line up with that. It doesnt move the world one because we only see two groups of mourners Metropolis residents and USG individuals. It doesnt actually create the Justice League Bruce Wayne has to go do that not based on Superman but on the coming threat. It doesnt actually carry the weight that it does in the comics which is that after all his victories this opponent can finally best him instead Doomsday is only his third opponent ever. Supermans death was memorable in the comics because of his long reputed career as both greatest superhero and figurehead of the Justice League. His death was shocking and tragic because the world already loved him. Here his death supposedly changes the worlds opinion about him? Well we dont see it and his brief twoyear stint was apparently only marked by controversy. That and the threat posed here is much smaller than that posed in the comic run in which Metropolis was actually at risk of being destroyed.Im not going to argue that the comic run is perfect. Far from it. but there were certainly better ways of doing Supermans death at a later point. And Superman dying certainly wasnt the only way he could get some needed public support.,DC_Cinematic,d9iv5si,1,t5_2ykm6

9720468,0,t3_5eba71,Lets see some of these are popular. I just want to share my thoughts. I love this version of Lex Luther and Superman. Ive always hated both Superman and Lex and found them boring. Superman feels more human in my opinion and Lex feels more real if that many any sense. Hes not some boring guy who craves knowledge and power. We actually see that hes traumatised about his childhood and his hatred for Superman is well done. I like Gal as Wonder Woman. I never wanted someone buff or super built. Often female warriors arent really built like that. And Gal has done a great job plus I believe the accent really adds to the character.Ezra is definitely Barry. I disagree with those who keep saying Hes Wally. Hes not for me. Barrys sense of humour is more awkward while Wallys is more cocky and sarcastic.I love this version of Superman and the best part? His story isnt over. People need to see that Clark was on a journey in the past two films. MoS he was this alien who was lost and trying to find a place where he belongs and debating about being a hero or not. BvS he realises being a hero isnt all glamour and cheerful and that some people are afraid. His death shows the world that this alien from another world was willing to save them and they honour him and getting the death over and done with is good as it truly had a meaning.Suicide Squad was good for what we got but it was all wrong. It should have been the team trying to stop WW breaking out and HIVE should have been the villain and ended with Enchantress breaking free of Waller this leading to a JLD.I want Matt Ryan as Constantine. He could easily be added into the DCEU. His NBC show is not connected to Arrow at all. So now Ryan has played Constantine  times would be nice if it was .I dont mind if actors dont fully resemble the characters as long as they can play the role. I want Cyborg to leave the league at the end of JL  and lead the Titans. Bring Martian Manhunter into the team but nerf him.Spin off some shows on HBO. A show based on Dick Grayson as Agent Grayson ending with him becoming Nightwing. A Question show. A JLD show with Matt Ryan as Constantine. A mini series focusing on the Secret Six or Outlaws With just Roy and Jason would be great. Hal Jordan should be a veteran in the Green Lantern Corp. Same with John. Guy should be a Red Lantern just to mix it up a little. And Kyle should be the rookie.,DC_Cinematic,dab9cdr,4,t5_2ykm6

And while I loved Batman I just couldnt relate to him. Robin on the other hand just seemed so much more accessible. He watched his parents die when he was a kid too but he didnt become all dark and brooding like Batman. He was able to keep his sense of humor and acted as Bruces foil. He literally laughed in the face of danger. While Bruce was more of a mask for the Batman Dick was able to keep them as  separate entities.Yeah the concept of Robin is kind of lame but each of the Robins have really great backstories and personalities.Anyways thats just my piece on it.,DC_Cinematic,dazj0yl,3,t5_2ykm6

9969009,0,t1_db6mn54,I think its a bit unfair to say that Marvels directors arent passionate about their projects. Some arent thats fair. But I think that this late in the game the director for The Flash might not be the most passionate either. John Favreau Joss Whedon Taika Watiti Edgar Wright James Gunn Scott Derrickson and The Russo Bros seemed passionate about their films. James Gunn especially is always talking about the various aspects of the Guardians comics that he enjoyed or wanted to adapt. John Favreau fought hard so that his vision of Iron Man could make it to screen. Edgar Wright sadly to his detriment really tried to make his own AntMan film as well. I see those directors on almost the same level as Snyder in their passion for the source material. The Russo Bros really understand what makes Steve Rogers such an interesting character. I see Snyders understanding of Superman the same way.,DC_Cinematic,db6zlah,4,t5_2ykm6

Ayer felt he could do it and I would love to read the draft of the script he wrote hat WB signed off on. BvS ultimate cut is my favourite CBM so I dont think it clarifies as much as makes a good film brilliant.

Sadly we cannot actually know objectively what people think of a fil.  Millions of pounds go into testing of films to ty and prejudge what audiences will respond to with varying degrees of success. Interesting you should bring up Trnsformers because I was trying to watch the fourth one on Netflix last night. I had to turn it off.

10029999,0,t1_dbeslj3,There is hope justice and peace. Superman Batman and Wonder Woman. The two fallen angles i.e Batman and Wonder Woman. Superman was on the point of giving up but realized the better for this world and continued to fight gave up on what they believed in. Batman has always the majority of the characters history I guess believed that there is good in all of us. No matter how monsterous we may be. We all need saving even when we dont deserve it. Wonder Woman goes for peace to continue to fight for a better result and live in harmony. But she entered Mans world at a bad time. That time being WWI a war believed to be the end of all wars which eventually ended nothing. Batman saw that criminals keep coming back no matter how many times he locks them away. He saw that his ways of doing things did nothing and he wasted  years fighting crime for nothing. Atleast thats the new mentality he gained made him think that but even seeing how rogues gallery never changed... maybe hes right. Killing Superman because of the chance that this powerful being going rogue can be inevitable. He believed that perhaps killing a potential threat can make his career matter. Wonder Woman gave up because she saw the savagery we commited. The war the brutal violence. We were monsters. She says that man created a world where standing together is impossible and... shes  not wrong. We work on power money etc. We have these mindsets from out ancestors that made us think the way we do.WW gave up because it was too late for mankind. Batman gave up because trying the same method doesnt always work. Well Batman has alot more reasons but thats atleast a major highlight of his reasonings. Superman almost gave up because he saw that his actions created more consequences and even when he does good the reactions to his cons shows how ungrateful people can be and how he cant please everyone.The point is hope justice and peace. To unite everyone to make and develop a better world. Batman and WW forgot what it meant to be a hero heroine. Because of Supermans sacrifice he inspired them to strive for whats actually good. To reach for hope not fall in misery and give up only to let the world continue making its mistakes. This diologue basically explains it allDiana Prince A hundred years ago I walked away from mankind  from a century of horrors. Man made a world where standing together is impossible.Bruce Wayne Men are still good. We fight. We kill. We betray one another. But we can rebuild. We can do better. We will. We have to.P.S Because of this the JL in the DCEU is now established to be built on hope. !,DC_Cinematic,dbexpz2,1,t5_2ykm6

10054348,0,t1_dbi2fot,gtYou cant be serious. Just image what the public would react if WB followed your advice. Fire Nolan and recast a bunch of great actors because they would not stay.The smart thing to do would have been to plan out a universe in advance and hire filmmakers who are willing to fulfill that vision. Sure Nolans films were great but in the long term they were kind of a detour. Of course WB could have decided not to rush things when launching a universe afterwards but if they didnt have the foresight to realize that a universe was the right thing to do beforehand I wouldnt expect them to know how to handle it afterwards. Long story short WB doesnt understand its comic book properties what makes them tick and what their fans want.gtTypical. Who else? You said comic book experts. Apparently your definition of comic book experts is anyone who is a successful CBM producer. Hindsight is always .Not just successful. Feige and the filmmakers he employs actually get these characters and understand how they fit into a cinematic universe while remaining true to their comic book roots and delivering on fan expectations. If the DCEU had accomplished this it wouldnt be receiving the backlash its receiving now which is not coming primarily from Marvel fans who want DC to fail but from comic book fans who are disappointed in the lackluster portrayal of their favorite characters. ,DC_Cinematic,dbi3tx0,1,t5_2ykm6

10057367,0,t1_dbih8a1,gtI know those films are from a while ago but not acknowledging them and their success is a lie and also makes hollywood less accountable. I acknowledged them and I even accepted Barbarella as an example even though it was actually just a star vehicle for Jane Fonda and  like the Star Wars films  did not live or die based on its own merits but rather had a builtin level of guaranteed success based on external factors. That more people have seen say Mad Max than Barbarella kinda says a lot about its lasting effects on Hollywood as well.I think acknowledging them and recognizing that they are decadesold makes Hollywood more accountable because it highlights how rare they are. While Wonder Woman isnt the movie that is going to by itself change Hollywoods and a large chunk of the fandoms perceptions on femaleled genre movies it is another weight on the scale of they can be good right alongside Hunger Games and Aliens to offset the large number of they suck as a concept socalledexamples like Elektra. This thread is about Wonder Woman specifically and she is the Anumberone female superhero of them all so of course the movies being looked at as potentially having a lot of influence on perception. Youll note were also discussing Captain Marvel as another thread in the tapestry. ,DC_Cinematic,dbihzkf,2,t5_2ykm6

10064765,0,t1_dbjgha2,gtBatman or anyone could set a ton of missiles and throw them to a major city for damage but it would require time set up and can be countered. Superman or Zod can just wake up one day and think ok going to level Metropolis for the lulz and no one could stop them.I understand what youre saying but I think you misunderstood me.Im not comparing Batman and SupermanZod but with Doomsday.While it would be hard for Batman to cause as much damage as Zod and Superman Doomsday can.In my opinion a Batman who was apocalyptically angry at Superman for his supposed misconduct in the BZ Event wouldnt willingly endanger Gotham.While the area might have been unpopulated Doomsday is very unpredictable and one jump could have meant the death of any number of innocent civillains.Which is why I dont think it makes sense for Batman to lure Doomsday to Gotham to get the spear rather than getting it himself and coming back to the island.I think dropping timed bombs on the island couldve distracted him enough to stay on the island and follow the explosions long enough allowing Bruce the time to come back and finish the job on the island......sparing Gotham any damage.I guess for me that decision didnt sit right with me  especially when focusing on Bruces character in BvS.,DC_Cinematic,dbjgnjq,3,t5_2ykm6

10328371,0,t1_dcer9iu,No I did mean the original comic book. Snyder adapted Watchmen very literally which limited his ability to replicate some of the patterns that book produces. Take for example Chapter V Fearful Symmetry which mirrors itself from front to back. If you have a copy handy a physical copy works best for this grab it and flip to the middle of the fifth issue Now move away from the middle one page at a time noting the structure of each set of pages on either side of the middle of the issue and youll see that they mirror each other. There is an insane amount of detail in this incredible work of art and Batman v. Superman truly adapts that kind of visual storytelling and symmetry to the movies in a way that the Watchmen movie had been unable to due the way it was written. But just like Watchmen had the fake magazine inserts and files in each issue to help flesh out the world of the story its cool to have things like the Purple Lamborghini video or the Time Out travel guide for Gotham City and Metropolis to go with the movies. So cool! And it manages to perfectly recreate moments from The Dark Knight Returns while doing all of that. Incredible!,DC_Cinematic,dces1in,3,t5_2ykm6

10347636,0,t3_5o61fp,I think Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice failed in the tasks it needed to accomplish. The way I see it this film had three tasks Complete Supermans development into a public inspirational hero  and Clark Kents development into a reporter Introduce a Batman and Bruce Wayne who can credibly stand sidebyside with this Superman and Pit Superman and Batman against each other in a way that sets the stage for the formation of the Justice League.I think BvS failed on at least two of those counts but by virtue of the last it failed on all three. First Superman did get development but it was mostly negative development into a sacrificial lamb rather than into the public and inspirational hero he needed to become in order to be a prominent leader in the Justice League. Clark Kent got even less development and was ultimately killed off.Second Batman was definitely reintroduced as someone as largerthanlife as Superman. But I felt that what he needed was an exploration of his battlescarred career in a richly depicted Gotham not another treatise on his parents deaths through the filter of TDKR. While an interesting take Frank Millers Bruce is an extreme version of the character that lacks the nuance of the cautious JL member. And JL doesnt seem like it will retain that necessary cautious inherent to Batmans relationship with the League.Third the conflict between Batman and Superman was almost entirely onesided shallow and when it came down to it brief. It did not explore the inherent differences that might prevent them from being partners it did not pit them against each other in a way that drew out their core characteristics and principles like iron sharpening iron and it did not set up the Justice League such that this conflict could be considered necessary to its founding.In that sense I think BvS was a colossal failure despite its financial success. Death of SupermanTDKR was not the BatmanSuperman conflict the DCEU  and specifically Justice League  needed certainly not one film in. The DC EU needed very specific developments if it was going to do Justice League this early. The fact that BvS didnt do that means that the DCEU is at a disadvantage regarding the Justice League film and in comparison to Marvels cinematic universe.,DC_Cinematic,dcgyq18,1,t5_2ykm6

Since the scout ship is still intact for the most part which were meant for colonization purposes they could just say Kal found a structure fabrication matrix or something that was intended to create buildings for colonists. Combine it with having the JorEl personality construct somehow survived zods system purge and voila. They could even say since his AI personality map from the key was thousands of years more advanced than the scout ship programming he just hid himself and made the ship AI think it had been successful. but since Superman let the humans have it and apparently not go back himself JorEl never revealed himself still being in the systems.,DC_Cinematic,dcju4cu,6,t5_2ykm6

10559893,0,t3_5r6rpm,Here might be the most unpopular post in this thread but at this point in time I think the sinking of the DCEU is very likely an inevitability. I dont doubt there are people who have real passion behind these projects and I believe Patty Jenkins has given her best to make Wonder Woman a great movie but unfortunately all this love and passion is in a toxic environment. Its like trying to build a tourist attraction in the middle of a swamp.The management over at Warner Bros has proven time and time and time again that they have absolutely no idea how to run a comic book cinematic universe. Their poor decision making careless choices and their reactionary behavior has proven this. I dont think a DC Universe can thrive under Warner Bros its just not the right studio for this but unfortunately were stuck with them.Personally while I think Ben Afflecks statement was well worded I dont completely buy it. He spent months resassuring us that the Batman movie was happening and that he was directing it and even when there were signs that there may be trouble he reassured as again. I honestly think he stepped down from the directors position for the same reason The Flash lost its director. Warner Bros was probably intereferring.I dont have much else to say other than I think unless Wonder Woman is a hit critically I think its time to wrap up the DCEU and try again some other time and hopefully WB will learn the right lessons and smarter management will be running the show next time around.,DC_Cinematic,dd5306c,30,t5_2ykm6

You have to listen to me and You dont understand He didnt automatically attack him.Now regarding Lex preventing Clark from telling Bruce i guess it works but on a film making level it fails because there is no set up and neither character ever wanted to fight the other until this point so it would be a very random thing and Batman would be suspicious of Superman the do gooder suddenly attacking him like that with  explanations.So even then we would have a situation where neither of them actually wants to fight. Maybe i wasnt clear enough in my original post but when i talk about the fight. that also includes the desire of at least  one of them to have a reason to actively go look for and fight the other after a believable set up.I dont know if that makes sense,DC_Cinematic,dd9bl3b,2,t5_2ykm6

10690388,0,t3_5svl0r,This seems to be just another case of WBs problems in developing these characters. Flash has had repeated creative issues. BvS and SS  for all the money they made  had significant development flaws. All of these stems from relatively rushed creativedevelopment decisions by WB at the last minute but also from a lack of real front end planning on not only what the slate should be but what the long term story should be. Theres no real cohesive cinematic vision its clear thats Snyders roadmap only included BvS JL and JL . Honestly I think after Aquaman WB needs to press pause take a year to come up with an actual planvision and then proceed. And as much as I love the focus on directordriven projects it doesnt seem to be working out well on the script side. So I think that just like Man of Steel and now Batman they should separate the script writing and the directing. If the script and story are dictated by the studios broader vision and competent writers the director can have as much freedom and he or she wants to bring that script to life.,DC_Cinematic,ddimuwd,6,t5_2ykm6

10704994,0,t3_5t4gte,Its a really good idea! Love the main premise having Batman trapped in Arkham. But I think it needs to be cleaned up a bit. In my opinion Green Arrow should be introduced in either a JL film or his own. I think having him in a Batman movie would take away from his character because well its Batman. Also Nightwing and the other BatFamily members should be doing something more. Like theres a breakout at Blackgate and they need to clean it up. Something so theyre not just standing around the whole movie doing nothing. I definitely like the setting as I feel like Arkham has a lot of potential for some really personal story telling. I think if you were clean up the plot a bit by taking some things out it would be a really strong idea. Either way man great idea! Love it a lot!!,DC_Cinematic,ddk52f0,6,t5_2ykm6

10828715,0,t1_ddww2yc,gt  Box office is more important to me than critical reception with regards to the DCEU as I just want the same kinds of films to continue getting made. Heres something to remember though. Youll get more movies if it makes money and is only hated and harshly reviewed by critics. You wont if it makes money but is hated and harshly reviewed by the majority of the moviegoing public. Spider Man  is a perfect example of this. Made a shit ton of money. Definitely more than doubled its budget. Didnt get a sequel because they knew the GA felt hoodwinked and had a lot of bad feelings towards that film franchise. Its amazing how much money it made and yet still killed the franchise.ASM  was to a lesser extent as it didnt actually double its budget and also had a lot of bad will from the GA afterwards pretty much guaranteeing a deal with Marvel.If the GA shits all over a project as big as JL or The Batman theres a good chance the future projects wont make that money and the studio may be hesitant to make them.,DC_Cinematic,ddwwlwi,2,t5_2ykm6
10829600,0,t3_5ut5co,I hate all the just reboot this shit people out there. Outside of the problems that the batman film seems to be facing every other person like Gadot or Manoa or the Rock seems genuinely pleased with their respective projects we have two large releases already ahead this year and they seem like theyre on track to be very respectable movies that millions will enjoy. Heres some facts both Marvel and DC had  major releases last year both ran a total of around  million in budgets and both did around .B at the global box office. WB and DC are not gonna be giving up on that kind of cheddar anytime soon especially with the two release coming out this year and being about  minutes away from launching into full blown production of Aquaman. Everyone is way too tied up in this batman film I mean I get it everyone loves batman we all loved Affleck and we all know the potential his standalone film has of being fantastic and the potential I know many of you want for it to be the final nail in the STFU coffin to the overly hater marvel people. That all said seriously relax and chill back and wait for the good news. If youre WB you are not about to hand over  million for a film to someone who isnt  onboard with where you want to take this picturelarger universe. We will have a director at some point we will have a batman Hopefully Affleck and we will have a film at some point. Until then lets just wait for actual news go enjoy WW and JL be happy Aquaman is starting and stop losing our minds at ever single shred of rumors or news that makes its way out. ,DC_Cinematic,ddwzwds,2,t5_2ykm6

Yes director departures and negotiations and script rewrites.  And disagreements.  We just dont usually hear about it.

10893075,0,t1_de3h2bq,He became fixated because hearing the African woman talk about how he chooses who matters caused him to become focused on trying to help people who he thought were being overlooked as if they didnt matter.  Those people being the people of Gotham.  Maybe fixing that would help alleviate some of the guilt he feels over who he has and hasnt saved.Im not sure what people wanted or expected him to say during the Senate bombing.  I can only imagine his devastation knowing all those people died around him and he couldnt save them.  He helped who he could and obviously needed to leave to try and deal with what just happened.  What could he possible say in that moment to make it right?  Especially when it just happened?  I didnt do it?  And even if he knew that people understood it wasnt him he clearly knows it happened because of someones hatred for him. He could ask if theyre alright but thats a silly question considering the circumstances.  And even if logically people know it wasnt him that doesnt mean they wouldnt still project the blame onto him.  And if I just saw hundreds of people blown apart I wouldnt be able to talk either.  He has emotions like everyone else.Id say since MoS hes learned that he cant save everyone and hes struggling with that and with the newly proposed question how do you make a choice about who matters.  You can have the best intentions and try your best but bad things will still happen.  As super as he is he cant be everywhere and save everyone.  It cant be easy to try and deal with the idea that your choice to save this person means that person dies.  He may have been at it for  years now but Im sure in beginning people were just in awe of what he could do.  Only down the line his actions start to be questioned and the idea planted in his head that maybe the things hes doing arent his right.  I think thats my hope with his death and rebirth.  That hell come back after sacrificing himself for everyone including his naysayers and the world will see him for the true hero that he is and wants to be.  He clearly wants to do good but the negativity is making him doubt himself.I think he was caught off guard over the desert fiasco because he had obviously never been in a situation where he was unbeknownst to him being framed.  It probably didnt occur to him that it would be twisted the way it was. He had no proof and hes not going to just call a press conference.  He said to Lois I didnt kill those people if thats what they think.  He clearly didnt know until that moment that he was being called into question.I really dont see how he was sad in MoS.  Being on the serious side and not smiley at all times doesnt equal sad.  He seemed like a normal person to me.Youre entitled to you opinion obviously but your reasons for reading or watching comicsmovies arent the only ones.  You may hate seeing superheros in a real world environment but to me it makes it feel like its more real or possible to see a world like we see it now and have someone super human in it. Im sorry that you dont enjoy this version.  Hopefully JL and WW will be movies we can both enjoy.,DC_Cinematic,de3jkmz,0,t5_2ykm6

That means that someone will inevitably  be dumb enough to look at that and think Lets make an R rated movie and not think will that rating suit the film they are making.  MARVEL is so family friendly that they will not risk doing a R rating. And since Fox has basically nailed down the R rating thing. That leaves Warner Bros to be the one to force am R rating on film first. Which technically they have already done with BvS. Absolutely no reason why a movie with Batman or Superman should be and R rating except if they were doing an adaptation of The Dark Knight Rises and even that is pushing itAfter maybe the first maybe  failed R rated movies maybe they could do  R rated thing.IMO They should get David Fincher and make an R rated Question movie. ORAnd if I was a WB executive and they wanted an R rated movie to make. They should make Batman Arkham Asylum or Killing Joke.

11039895,0,t1_dej0a69,Its not about standalone vs. serial as much as it is Snyders desire to treat Superman more as an object than as an actual character. It is not insignificant that Clark spends most of his time in this film silently listening to what other people are saying about him when he should have been spending his time learning abouttrying to take down Batman. BvS could have used Superman to introduce the others in a way that also developed Superman as a character as I have said Superman and Batman clashing over their different ways of upholding justice was a brilliant idea for how to  reintroduce Batman as a weary crimefighter  develop Superman as a moral inspirational defender of truth and justice remember up to now hes only been a super first responder and  set up the DCEU for a league of largerthanlife but grounded heroes that not only protect the world from alien threats but also fight for justice among humans.BvS could have done this even within the general story Snyder wanted. The problem is that Snyder wanted to double down on the idea of Superman as the transcendent unknowable disruptive Christ figure despite the fact that MoS already tread that ground in a way that was more fitting to the Superman mythos AND focused on SupermanClark as a character. And in choosing to retread that ground Snyder not only undid all of the development Clark experienced in MOS but he also took Superman in the exact opposite direction in which he needed to develop.,DC_Cinematic,dejcpeq,1,t5_2ykm6

Were supposed to believe that Mjolnir and everything that weve seen with Thor is NOT magic? Just advanced science? Bull. Not to mention they misquoted Arthur C. Clarke.

11270318,0,t1_df9gp49,But they dont pay off. Sure they tie into the plot but there is no payoff for it in the story. You keep comparing it to SpiderMan in Civil War which is a false equivalence. SpiderMan plays a role in the story albeit a minor one and therefore must be introduced. Thors vision sets up Ragnarok and Infinity War but it also sets up Vision. They both pay off in the films narrativeA more apt comparison would be the postcredit scene for Winter Soldier. Strucker discusses the HYDRA infiltration of SHIELD so it ties in but the ultimate purpose of that scene is to show off Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. If that scene were to be placed at the start of the third act it would be a set up with no payoff. This is what the email scene is and thats why its a problem ,DC_Cinematic,df9h2oa,8,t5_2ykm6

11317687,0,t1_dfesbtw,The comic doesnt shy away from showing Caps desperation to win this war just like it doesnt shy away from showing Tonys machinations. I wont spoil the end but its pretty sad and infuriating at the same time.Either way in strictly political terms it does show that the heroes would essentially be held hostage both socially and financially. They could be fined for a destroyed car in a battle and theyd have their true identities held by the government. They essentially could be forced to pay for the destruction actually caused by supervillains could have their family put at risk at literally any moment specially when so many hackers manage to get classified info and the laws naturally can always be changed to the point where the US would become a tyranny of governmentregulated indoctrinated superheroes masquerading as a democracy. Just imagine Superman in that position. Specially after the Black Zero Event...To be fair Tony wasnt pure evil just a coward. He tried to fight it in court but didnt have the balls to see the fight through. He even estimated and showed in court that superheroes managed to save the world so many times under a period of time that all rebuilding costs became much smaller in comparison to the possibility of absolute loss and the gains to the protection of the planet the superheroes offered. The courts didnt care. Its kinda made clear they wanted to get the debt away from the government and have control over superheroes. To me at least... And I was a big government lover at the time I read Civil War.Theres a DC animation that tackles a similar problem. Its called Batman amp Superman Public Enemies. Luthor is president and Superman is portrayed as a vile conspirator against democracy by the government. All is a scam. Giving the power of judge jury and executioner to a government that controls superheroes is a terrible idea. Its already a terrible idea in human terms.Truth is that Civil War is Marvels Injustice that pretends nothing happened afterwards. Fantastic but the editors clearly didnt see eye to eye on the message or simply didnt want to make a huge story to fix the problem. They pretend everything went fine after that and that the government was just trying to do the right thing even though the government was more concerned with fighting Captain America than reaching a midterm deal.,DC_Cinematic,dfeuam9,2,t5_2ykm6

Sometimes theyll do something just to be different. They are fickle like that. I think its a decent time more action oriented it will be recieved better by critics and audiences. People act like they care about plot holes even though bvs when you break it down doesnt have any but they dont. People dont care about that shit. Critics ignore plot holes all the time. Literally all the time. People and critics dont care. People want to enjoy their time at the theater especially with a movie like JL and i think thats bvs biggest flaw. There wasnt that entertainment factor. Superman and Batman barely fought. There was a lot talking and thinking. People dont care about that stuff.

Also i dont know why they need to bother with a friction proof suit given that the Speedforce protects the wearer anyway.gtI never really bought the leather suit as friction proof in the tv show plus this Flash seems much more powerful If those panels are meant to be shuttle pieces are meant to be friction proof the TV shows flashs leather suit can also be friction proof. gtI do hope his upgraded suit does stay armor looking but a bit more sleek and simple. Judging by the other costumes I dont see any reason for it not to be the caseI really dont like the armoured look to his costume Id rather something like Supermans nice and simple it doesnt need million pieces to look good to be honest a a higher budget version of this suit with yellow boots and propper ear wings and it would look great,DC_Cinematic,dfnly7x,3,t5_2ykm6

11626759,0,t3_65wgzv,its a prequel sorry....yeah it is.now I would have released it right after MoS.  basically its A Death in the Family and Killing Joke rolled into one night.  so we have Jason Todd and Batman slightly bickering about criminals joker and punishment and we even bring in some sibling rivalry with Todd feeling he cant live up to who Grayson was whatever.  but eventually about  hour in we have Todd getting kidnapped but simultaneously Barbra was shot and Gordon taken as well.  and the entire time Batman has been trying to rescue Gordon the timer for Todds death grows shorter.  once Batman has the Joker Joker reveals he was just killing time.  the clock winds down and we cut back to bruce and the joker and we hear an explosion maybe at wayne manor??? P  bruce looks up and back down and just beats him down eventually shipping him to Arkham we get a funeral etc. etc. etc. Bruce hangs up the cowl stating hes done all he can this fight was always bigger than him but he never saw it and all hes done is reign in more punishment upon gotham....upon a boy.  screen cuts to black................title card  years later...the black zero event begins. ,DC_Cinematic,dgdwlp8,5,t5_2ykm6

11689674,0,t1_dgkav4t,Right. They talk like not competing with each other is a good thing. They SHOULD be creating competing products to challenge each other. The arrogance in the comic book industry is off the scale they think that they can get away with creating homogenous products and that fans will just buy them regardless. I believe in mutual respect but the big two should be challenging each other to create better products. I dont want a world where Marvel and DC are trying to cater to the same market in exactly the same way. I respect Gunn and Johns but the latters agenda seems to consist of making DC movies more like Marvel ones to the point where he cant actually support a DC movie thats been released. And all this camaraderie only serves to convince people that those who like a certain type of superhero would only dislike another kind if it were genuinely bad.,DC_Cinematic,dgl1jf1,1,t5_2ykm6
11689708,1,t1_dgl1270,I dont think its bullshit or a cop out. Ive yet to hear any articulation on how it is objectively bad. Only personal preferences. To be honest the TC is just fine. It rushes things but nowhere near the point of being this broken story or mess people claim it to be. Everything was clear enough in the TC and only left a few moments where you needed to suspend disbelief. We have the UC because WB wanted a shorter film.

11717781,0,t1_dgo6y23,Batman has been driven by anger and irrational anger before in the comics. That was the point of his character in BVS and pretty sure he was well prepared all throughout the movie. Literally setting up the stage in which he fought superman. It was like  years of planning. I dont think that constitutes as hot headed. Also how is batmans arc not believable any more than any other arc? Superman is allowed to deal with internal conflict. Superman is allowed to be conflicted. Superman is allowed to be concerned about the consequences of his actions and how that effects other people. He literally goes through the same thing in comics Superman doesnt always have to be flawless. Things like how his actions effect other people SHOULD matter to superman. I guess a guy that does everything to save people without question despite being rejected by everyone isnt likable.Composed should not be Lex Luthors defining trait. There are MANY different interpretations of the characters and composed should not be a core character trait although i do see him becoming more composed in the future and i dont think that would even be considered a soft reboot either considering such drastic event is bound to shape all the characters in the movie especially lex. Geoff Johns even quoting that this is the origin of lex luthor the lex luthor from the comics as he put it. He said that before there was even a blacklash. May i recommend superman birthright where hes a very angry and unhinged because of how much he knows. Very similar to Jesses lex actually in more ways than one. Its actually spot on from the motivations looks franticness etc. Lex Luthor is a character that rants about everything all kinds of philosophical ideas and how that relates to what hes thinking. He rants about god biblical ideals compares history myth etc. He does all of that in the comics the same way jesses lex does. Also Lex also in the comics was born rich the say way Jesses lex was. Lex Luthor didnt come rags. His father was lionel luthor wealthy residents. Thats not something that was fabricated by the movies. Lex in bvs hates superman because he sees him as existentially wrong as a fraud that needs to be exposed the same way as the comics. These are all things from the comics. You might not be familiar with the comics but these are from the comics but that is very true to cannon.  ,DC_Cinematic,dgo8mvv,2,t5_2ykm6
