171251,0,t3_1vwkyj,I have not yet. Im going to pick up a Rohrbaugh RS when I get my tax return in the hopes that Ill actually carry it with me considering its smaller size and ridiculous price. The Kahr CM I had stolen was the absolute best concealable mm from a pricesizereliability standpoint... I just feel dumb replacing a stolen item with the exact same item... especially if it means Ill end up leaving it in my car again which I am now completely paranoid about. Thought long and hard about picking up a . like the LCP or something but all my other guns are mm and youre right its nice to only have to buy one ammo type and mm is affordable unlike . for some retarded reason. ,NVOS,cexxs8c,1,t5_2z4iv
190369,0,t1_ceyw3ky,I think you should get your CCW if only to have the option. Also it has some other benefits like when you get pulled over most cops will at least know youre not a felon when you show them your permit which is peace of mind for them. And  of cops are gun people and might even go easier on you simply for being another gun person. Another benefit is with the permit at least in FL you dont have to wait  days when purchasing a gun you can walk in to the store and buy one then walk out with it. If I lived in your area I would totally bring a gun wilderness hiking... You have motherfucking bears and mountain lions and those are just as scary as crackmethheads. ,NVOS,cf04fhp,1,t5_2z4iv

4287357,0,t3_3a1oky,The PipboyApp thing seems gimmicky but I totally dig the settlements and crafting and the rest of the game.All of the recent Fallout talk made me nostalgic so I ended up reinstalling Fallout  again and played it a fair bit. Until I bought The Forest and have been totally hooked on that recently.,NVOS,cs8wmtu,1,t5_2z4iv
