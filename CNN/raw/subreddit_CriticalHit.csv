11395844,0,t3_5ljg42,I came here just to ask this question. Its a little obvious that hes lying or accidently using  loaded dice. I like the story and the characters but if youre just going to cheat then dont pretend like you re playing the game. Its not so slight as he rolls s  of the time. Im at episode  and his average d roll had to be above . The only time he rolls under or very poorly is when it doesnt matter or when it makes for good role play. So its safe to say his cheating continues ?,CriticalHit,dfnpc7r,1,t5_2vpb7
