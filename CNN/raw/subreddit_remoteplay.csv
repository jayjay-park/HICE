8800652,0,t1_d75l2ac,Yes as a matter of fact I bought a Nymbus Steel Series for  bucks Tuesday from best buy. I went with this for how closely it resembled at DS at first glance and I love it. Most MFi made for IphoneIpadIpod controllers are compatible and Ive heard a lot of good stuff about the Horipad too. Just make sure you read the fine print to make sure its compatible with your device before you buy. My Nymbus works great with my iPhone  and my iPad Pro. only thing Im missing is being able to press down on the joystick for RL buttons but you can actually remap that to a different combo of buttons. ,remoteplay,d75pvsk,2,t5_2zszf

11138436,0,t1_deu3p4e,Thanks! Just to clarify if I just want to use the DS controller locally using the second account method all Id have to do is flash the Sony framework through recovery then  install the Remote Play app?,remoteplay,deuj3wp,1,t5_2zszf
11188055,0,t3_5zqaw1,Dont make that request in the Remote Play XDA thread. Theyll go after you.In that same thread there are steps you can take to trick the app into thinking your device is a Sony but it requires many steps including unlocking your bootloader voids the warranty and possibly rooting your device.,remoteplay,df05iir,1,t5_2zszf
