11571250,0,t1_dg7lqnc,Ive been through LG and Samsung and Stock OSs. They are all workable each has its pros. I love the way that stock Android looks and performs. But it just doesnt come default on very many attractive devices. Im getting the S because Samsung will update it they will take care of it. It might be a little slow but for how sexy that phone is its a worthwhile tradeoff. My S got pretty frequent updates from TMobile and I dont see that being any different this gen.,Galaxy_S8,dg7lv7e,0,t5_3jrcg

11678519,0,t1_dgjh60i,Ive actually set Nova to open the app drawer on swipe down and up. I set the two finger swipe down to open settings. Since the finger print reader can pull down notification shade. I use that,Galaxy_S8,dgjrz0z,1,t5_3jrcg
