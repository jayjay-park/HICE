7431826,0,t3_4gxh6j,I really like Desktop Dungeons. It is probably the lightest a game can get while still being very true to a classic roguelike experience. You can play the free version here I tried to use a lot of what I learned from it while creating my own roguelikelilke in special it comes to mind having the screen and game world be much smaller than normal roguelikes which can be hundred of screens long if you consider different dungeon levels and such. rjavelinrlI guess you could say rdoomrl is a bit like that as well.,roguelites,d2my9el,2,t5_2xt52
