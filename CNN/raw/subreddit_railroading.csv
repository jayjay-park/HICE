11608919,0,t1_dg85ip7,The railroad is extremely safety oriented. Cant believe the extra precautions we go through some is just annoying and unneeded.Every shift starts with a safety briefing. Any hazardous task will get its own briefing as well.Its a  operation I work nights. Visibility is a big thing. Even during the day we are required to wear reflective safety vest and other highvis ppe.Not much changes at night luckily most the property is well lit just gotta take a bit more care watching for trip hazards. We have bright head lamps and good flashlights the work trucks also have bright led flood lights so usually the darkness isnt a problem at night. Id say drowsiness is a much bigger issue. Most of us probably dont get enough good sleep just like any other job working nights we often do repetitive work that allows us to zone out at times and this is when accidents likely happen.Weather has a impact on us. We have many outdoor jobs and temp can be  out or well over  both with their own hazards.  Gotta make sure to dress properly and if you need to warm up or cool off you gotta make sure to take a break and do so not push your limits.,railroading,dgbvq9k,2,t5_2r35h
