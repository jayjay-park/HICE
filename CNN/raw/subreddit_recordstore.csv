1013897,0,t3_25liiu,There are dozens of s and s rap groups that never really reached a wide audience but are very good. Main Source reached a peak in critical reevaluation about a decade ago  Breaking The Atoms is an essential release. Lesser known s East Coast acts like Black Sheep Organized Konfusion and D.I.T.C.   Diamond D are all great and have funk breaks for days.  Beatnuts was previously mentioned and is a solid pick. Other great lesser known West Coast acts include Souls Of Mischief and Tha Alkoholiks. I personally really like Kid Frost best known if at all for La Raza. ,recordstore,chjjclm,1,t5_2t795

I just couldnt find a subreddit where this would absolutely fit so I took a chance and posted here.  Figured the worst that would happen is a mod would remove it.

I like some of the sounds they produce but to actually thoroughly listen to them no.gtJambinaiNoisy music on the other hand is my jam. Especially when it incorporates korean music into it. Kinda reminds me of Voodoo Kungfu or Quest for Blood if they were from Korea and werent batshit insane. I like this.gtHow do you feel about softer stuff like The Octopus Project or Eluvium?I like softer stuff. I like pretty much anything as long as its engaging. I much prefer The Octopus Project here. Eluvium is the sort of thing I listen to when I have trouble sleeping not something I just put on and listen for fun.,recordstore,d84g6td,1,t5_2t795
