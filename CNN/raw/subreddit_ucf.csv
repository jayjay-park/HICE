Its not daycare play with other doggies all day and then sleep at night kinda place its more kennel boarding really big stall like kennels though not cages and they get multiple individual walks a day. They might be able to take him even though he hasnt completed his shots since he wont be interacting with other dogs. We had a last minute trip over Christmas and our usual doggy daycare place was booked full and he stayed there and it worked well in a pinch. They could also maybe recommend dog sitters if they cant take him. Another option My usual doggy daycare place is Dog Day Afternoon downtown on Sligh Blvd and they wont be able to take him due to the shots but all of the girls who work there LOVE dogs and are so sweet. Maybe call and see if a staff member is interested in watching a lab puppy for a few days? Just a thought. Hope it works out for you! ,ucf,cfpsv7h,2,t5_2qh7r

You also are paid to put in  hours of practice during the week. Programming team is much more like a job than a club.However what you learn is pretty much CS and you learn how to code at a MUCH higher level so you use these skills from programming team all the time and these skills are the reason Google wants UCF team members so bad.Personally the best thing I got out of it was traveling. The contest sites are all over the place so I thought it was fun to be able to get to know my team members in a noncollegiate setting.When you meet up its a lecture usually on a programming technqiue these lecture are also perfectly ok to attend if your not a team member followed by a  hour long mock contest which is essentially just another locals competition the tryout next weekIm the peer tutor for this class so you can stop by next week during my hours and id be happy to share my experience and give tips on CS!,ucf,cjvoz8n,4,t5_2qh7r

Management even opened an apartment for him to move into. He never moved out.The second time they came for vandalism for him dumping a gallon of milk  months past the expiration date all over my bedroom door and another roommates bedroom door. The police said that because it could easily be cleaned up it is not considered criminal activity and its a problem management is supposed to deal with. We ended up cleaning the mess ourselves.Last night the police were here for the window. I was told that because it is not technically my property I cannot file charges against him. That is the managements decision. Security of this place said that management will most like just slap a fine onto his rent and not file charges. The security people have also agreed management is shitty here.Believe me Ive tried. Ive brought UCFs Student Conduct into this. Theyre the only ones whove done SOMETHING so far....

While Bright Futures ended up not covering it if I recall correctly I went and talked to my adviser and he told me that he would edit it in the system to make it count towards my undergrad degree. He never did it because hes lazy. So I never ended up getting it covered by Bright Futures. Still I would say start with your academic adviser. Im sure they deal with this on a semiregular basis and if they cant directly help they can at least point you in the right direction.,ucf,cnm265d,3,t5_2qh7r

Just study his lecture slides and make sure you know the material well enough to think critically with it.

Some people say going to school for web design is useless but I went mainly the networking and experience. I found hardworking talented classmates from multiple tracks and majors that I know Ill work with again in the future one of them is my business partner. Also most companies still want to see if you have a degree. For example it shows you can work and complete something thats long term. That  a strong portfoliopersonality will stand out to the traditional corporations. P.S take your prereqs at a community college and save some money. ,ucf,co5ovfy,2,t5_2qh7r

They also wanted to be a doctor so they also got a minor in biology. Graduated with a high .x GPA and got into med school. So it can be done. However if you do art  business youll need to be really in top of internships be active in professional societies and similar if you want a decent job after you graduate.

3082688,0,t1_cohcagd,Thank you for your honest opinion posts like this are why I started the thread and what I wanted to discuss and hear your feedback.I would like to point out that ALL of the levels of protection beyond requiring a .edu address are completely optional and it was designed to work both ways intentionally. IE You can choose to use an alias name and photo if you want and Buy Now buttons are not required the contact info of the seller is visible for you to do it the old fashioned way in person as preferred.In fact we recently had a student sell their car on Corqboard for . The buyer saw it on Corqboard met up with them on campus looked the car over and drove it then pulled out their phone and pressed Buy Now and put it on their credit card. And If you have a good card youre paying  interest on it and earning points.The public opinion and skepticism to anonymity is not a new argument but one that sites like facebook and linkedin haveare changing over the years. I personally like the direction things have been going because it highlights what the internet does best and lends more transparency to everything. The private information in user profiles on Corqboard are not public but only contactable by other members.What kind of threat is banning someone?Banning a member is a precaution taken if someone intends to scam the system not for a lifethreatening crime in that event you should contact the appropriate authority.I think most people online just want to buy or sell shit.I agree with you and Corqboard allows you create your pin at any school you choose to for more exposure.Additionally having to pay a service feeThere are no fees on Corqboard you can sell things just as you currently do on craigslist and have the added peaceofmind of dealing with fellow Knights. If you add a Buy Now button we take a small up to  max if the transaction goes through. Thats giving you buyer protection and its less than half of what ebay fees are. sell a laptop on ebay and theyll charge you As a seller its great because not many people carry cash anymore and dont want the hassle of going to the ATM and potentially paying their fees. It also helps eliminate tire kickers because if its something they want it encourages buyers to click Buy Now and not risk losing the item to someone else who will click Buy Now while they go look at it.For instance if you have a used  textbook for sale the bookstore will offer to buy it back for pennies on the dollar usually  of what you paid for it and then resell it for . If you post the same book on Corqboard and choose to put a Buy Now button you can sell it for  cheaper than the bookstore and keep  of that..But the real beauty comes with things you arent using and probably wouldnt sell otherwise a lamp or your bicycle for instance. In that case  of something is a lot more appealing than  of nothing. But again Buy Now buttons are completely optional.Lastly if they dont use it now why would they go back to your site after college?Great question Corqboard is designed to work at all major universities so for instance I am a UCF alum but I live across the street from Stanford so I browse and pin to the Stanford Corqboard. Its great if youre in grad school or working on your phD. ,ucf,cohiopj,1,t5_2qh7r

3546513,0,t1_cpvvoec,Bare with me as I try to ELI So if you werent aware all student tuition contains a portion for a technology fee.  This money gets put into a pile and then gets fought over via technology fee requests.  The tech fee committee deliberates on each of the requests and decides which ones get approved.  For example I believe it was two years ago the majority of the tech fee approvals were to upgrade the campus network hardware which is why the wireless has been slowly getting better on campus.  To my knowledge the major deciding factor in this decision was the SGA President pushing the narrative that students were not happy with the campus wireless infrastructure.  Another example this past year a majority of classrooms were approved to have the AV systems upgraded.  There were over  tech fee proposals and a little over  approved.If you are wondering who all comprises the tech fee committee here is the  CommitteeI hope this answers your question.,ucf,cpwiwvv,1,t5_2qh7r

Youre not quitting you just took on too much and will get back to that class when you are better prepared. Your advisor has useful information about withdrawing and whether it might be right for you.

5955450,0,t3_3wzvyd,Gonna copypaste the same advice I offered to another poster a couple moths agoDid you transfer to another public collegeuniversity in Florida and are trying to meet their General Education requirements? If you had met the GenEd and Gordon Rule requirements at UCF you can obtain a General Education Requirements Met statement or GERM statement on your UCF transcript. The GERM statement should suffice in terms of meeting the other FL public schools GenEd requirements.If you need a GERM statement on your transcript contact Academic Services to initiate the request If you really need an AA degree from UCF you can get one awarded but itll take a bit of work at this point   you must be a currently enrolled student to receive an AA degree and apply for the degree formally through Academic Services. Since youve been out for two semesters you may need to readmit in order to enroll in a class at UCF. There is a graduation placeholder course that you can enroll in but at this point its quite late in the semester to pursue this. It will also cost money to enroll in the placeholder course  about  to get this placeholder course. You should contact your current school to see if they accept the GERM statement instead and if theyre a FL public school they must honor it.EDIT OH. Youre the same poster. What happened? What school are you at? Why wont they take the GERM statement?,ucf,cy0agbt,2,t5_2qh7r

6510769,0,t1_czsqnpc,Excess hours applies to everyone that enters a FL state university starting Fall  or later no matter the method of payment. Depending on your start date though your baseline limit might be different. You can see a summary of how excess hours is treated here For example a student who entered into a state university for the first time in Fall  doing a typical  credit hour degree program can take  credit hours before they get hit with an excess hours charge and the surcharge is only an additional  of the tuition rate. But a student who started in Fall  at a state university can only take  credit hours before excess hours kicks in and then at an additional  surcharge rate.I do want to note that the excess hours discussion is different from the one that the OP is concerned about but based on what others have said it looks like federal aid cuts off at  hours. You can obviously keep taking classes after that point but youd have to pay completely out of pocket AND get hit with excess hours surcharges.,ucf,czsri0q,1,t5_2qh7r

If you are trying to teach someone to program and you actually give a damn you will take a little bit of time to look over it and give them feedback on what they did and did not do well. Running it through a script and grading you on the output is just fucking lazy. The feedback is not valuable and it does not take into account the totality of the work or the students understanding of the material.Yes results do matter but learning to avoid those types of mistakes takes time and an intro class is the wrong place to be teaching it. Anyone that tells you that they are grading based on a script in order to teach you about the real world is lying to you as it it to awkward to say that they are cheating you out of the education for which you are paying thousands of dollars because they are too lazy to actually grade your assignment and give you meaningful feedback.,ucf,d06rn7o,1,t5_2qh7r

Explain to me how was your school life in high school? Did you procrastinate and not do work back then too? Or is this a new thing due to having complete freedom?You saying that it was hard for you to actually make yourself do work....hm. Would you say its just you being lazy or you running wild and having fun? Or would you say its more of you maybea being depressed?b being anxious?c having a deep uncontrollable desire to avoid work and procrastinate?d being unable to focus?If its any of those I think you may benefit from speaking with a therapist or seeing a psychiatrist. UCF offers these services on campus of course you can go anywhere and I can recommend you a great psychiatrist near the area if you have a car...or I suppose you could take a bus too. Ive had a hard time with doing work in the past and I still do. Not all the time I can hyperfocus but I often cant do work when it needs to be done. While I do suffer from anxiety and some depression for me personally a lot of this came from what I suspect is ADHD. And you know what? Getting a diagnosis of ADHD and using ADHD drugs has really helped a lot. They dont solve everything but they help with the focus.Being unable to focus is a good reason to avoid work. So if you can help battle that its easier to attack your work and not avoid things. But idk feel free to tell me about your daily habits including whether you use recreational drugs and your feelings of whether you may suffer from some mental health issues. I might be able to help guide you in the right direction if thats the case.I may be totally off. But if Im not I think what you really need is a healthier lifestyle.

8549503,0,t3_4wvrv5,Yes. I was in the same boat as you my parents lived in Waterford and I just couldnt justify moving out.College felt like high school again. Id go to class and come straight home after. People always told me how amazing college was and I didnt get it college sucked. It was just high school except way harder.And then it clicked. People who enjoyed college stayed at college. People who enjoyed college got themselves out of their comfort zone and stayed on campus. They had to make friends because they needed to come up with something to do at  PM on a Tuesday because they sure as shit arent going to sit in the dorm. I didnt have to do any of that because I just called up my high school buddies.My long drawn out point here is the experiences people always talk about happen organically when you live on campus. You hang around the quad because theres shit else to do you get into dumb contests with your roommates but at the same time living on campus is hilariously expensive and youre right to not do it if you dont have to. Focus on bringing youself outside your comfort zone join some clubs stay on campus longer than you have to.Good luck.,ucf,d6a9d91,22,t5_2qh7r

Ended up getting like a  on my first CS exam and withdrew immediately after getting my test back. Withdrew from discrete too before giving it a chance and stayed in Calc .Was it the best choice? Probably not. But it gave me time to refine my studying ethics and return to CS this semester and kick ass. The teachers you have for CS and Discrete are probably the hardest they are prepping the CS majors for the foundation exam. As a CE major or IT these classes are required but they wont contribute to a foundation exam so if you only want a decent grade consider withdrawing and waiting for a term where CS and Discrete are taught by easier going faculty members i.e. not Guha or Szumlanski.tldr I think you may be able to do alright in CS.

9661209,0,t1_da3wvsn,gtBut what is your point really?Youre implying they have money to spend on a security system solely based on their estimated annual revenue. Youre purposely skewing information to try to sway opinion. You gave a number with no citation to prove its validity. You then conveniently left out their expenditure to make it seem like they were banking the full amount each year. My other point was that area as a whole is operating at a loss UCF is not idling sitting on a pile of money. Ignoring financial safety plansreserves.I am going to guess you used the estimations from this sheetPage  of . Where they estimate their revenue will be . million. Their expenditures are estimated at . million. Theyre saving about . million per year if that estimation held true. Again that area as a whole was reported not estimated to have lost money in .Lets assume that estimated number is right at the end of  they had  million saved. Its proper planning to have money saved to cover the costs of new construction. This year they spent  million of it on the Garage C extension. Maybe they had  million left. Lets say they did.If you want full coverage in all the garages it was stated to cost  per garage. Since four of the garages have the entrances covered by cameras lets say its  to upgrade them to full coverage the cost difference between the options.  would be the total cost for full coverage. In the OPs situation it sounds like full coverage would have been needed if not for a bystander. The total amount is well above the amount left from last year.We can safely assume they had revenue again this year but at the same time neither of us know what new garages they will build or which they might extend. Simply put saying they have a large revenue does not prove they have the extra capital to invest into a security system at this time without knowing a lot of additional details. Details I do not feel you know or can provide. What youve tried to imply that they have a large revenue and therefore should have money to spend on cameras hasnt been proven.We could speculate further about finances but it doesnt serve a purpose. When there is money and time theyll do it no reason to get angry or assume theyre not taking action without evidence.,ucf,da3y2m1,1,t5_2qh7r

A car is a tool not an investment. If they dont understand that basic principle of personal finance they are not qualified to dispense financial advice. This especially goes for the current top commenter in this thread and his remarks about home ownership. Very rarely does a home appreciate in value over amd above the interest you paid on the mortgage alone not even accounting for property taxes and repairs made along the way.

After building a connection you could ask for resume advice or general advice and sometimes if you build a good enough impression they may refer you to someone who has an open position. Also have multiple resumes. I try to tailor mine to the jobposition Im specifically applying for. I know youre going for Digital Media but honestly some of the skills you have learned can go towards different areas of marketing. ,ucf,dew5uia,7,t5_2qh7r

11204440,0,t3_5zy7i6,If you want to feel great about career readiness and finding a job switch to accounting No but seriously I only say this as someone who is a bit older and has heard from people on both sides  I know a lot of people who majored in finance and wish they had done accounting or at least double majored.You can definitely find a job in finance but the number of opportunities pale in comparison to what you can find in public accounting.A lot of people I know end up going places like Northwestern Mutual or Merrill Lynch which arent bad but are also very sales based. Plenty of people also go the insurance route. I know Verizon has a big office in Lake Mary though and I hear they hire a lot from UCF. I know a few people who are financial analysts for them now. Also accounting is so valuable because its the language of business and you can switch from accounting over to anything else in business once youre in the real world but you cant switch from something else to accounting if that makes sense. ,ucf,df20c21,2,t5_2qh7r

11327426,0,t1_dffxxiq,Another redditor replied thisWhile transient does save money I would talk to an advisor before doing so as the CECS has stopped giving overrides into followup classes for current transient coursework being takenIn other words you will need to wait until grades are posted and sent to UCF before you can sign up for any classes that require the transient course as a coprereqThis is why I am now not sure what to do because not being able to have an override for calc  and statistics for fall semester will also negatively affect me.,ucf,dffy107,1,t5_2qh7r
11335450,0,t1_dfguhif,Is there any other course you would recommend in place of OOP in that case?  I also still need bio    or bio   chem  to fulfill my gen ed requirement or would be fine with doing a more basic majorrelated course.As for summer right now Discrete is being taught but each of the  classes offered says that staff is teaching them.  ,ucf,dfguqg2,1,t5_2qh7r
11346161,0,t3_61sk0b,Suppose you have a  minute drive to UCF when all speed limits are followed strictly and about half of it is on the . Every ish mph over the speed limit you go on  saves you one minute assuming you maintain that speed the entire time youre on the highway. That means going  saves you about  whole minutes. Its easier to leave  minutes earlier than it is to go  the entire time. Cheaper too.,ucf,dfi2fg9,3,t5_2qh7r

11545301,0,t3_64sepo,TlDr No you dont. Just set up orientation date and go. Bring stuff they say you need to bring. If you have been accepted you have to set your orientation date. You wont be able to do very much until that is done I tried lol. Make sure you got your immunization documents ready they have a form you need to fill out which can be done digitally and then printed out then bring that on orientation. If you intend to do an online program you will not have to do that step. But yeah congratulations on your acceptance and check out the orientation page. Oh and set up your MyUCF stuffknights email account. Be sure to check often in your MyUCF account sidebar Student Self Service gt Holds and ToDos. Give them whatever they require. Most if not all documents can be submitted through email. ,ucf,dg4nu8x,11,t5_2qh7r
