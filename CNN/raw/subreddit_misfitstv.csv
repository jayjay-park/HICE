1560974,0,t1_cj7ukvp,Well it never explains how that all resolves. Its left to the Viewer perspective. When Future Simon goes back he creates an alternate timeline where Alisha lives. So it can be assumed that since Present Simon knows about his future selves death he has the chance to stop Alisha from dying without getting himself killed in the process.This means that theres a chance that Present Simon could fix what happens to the Gang at the end of Season  and then make it so that timelines Simon doesnt have to go back to try to fix it. ,misfitstv,cjbxvx8,2,t5_2s8pg

9580037,0,t1_d9q6mu3,Completely agree... they had to deal with a whole cast change in Season  which changed the momentum of the show. I personally think they did the best with what characters they had left and tried their best to incorporate the new ones... That said season  was probably the lowest point of the series. However I will say that in Season  they pick up the lost rhythm and it comes back with a punch! It reminded me of the good old misfits gang ,misfitstv,d9txoks,4,t5_2s8pg
