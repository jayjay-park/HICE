8762508,0,t1_d70yr82,And Ill tack on this added piece as to the argument for the alliance we have as well as the TRUE REVELATION of what got me to winning Season .This game is not survivor. Its not new people every season its the same returnees with an influx of new players. The key to winning this game is not to do well and play well its to play the game as a whole. Not as one season but as all seasons are one game.At this point you dont win the game by playing well. Betraying people will get you far but wont get you jury votes from some and will hamper your ability to have peoples trust in future seasons.Rather this is a game of building relationships over multiple seasons. Making friends who you can trust completely and knowing who you can trust. Why do you think Mike won  seasons? People like him and hes a good person. I won in a similar fashion. Working with people I liked to get to the end doing well in challenges and ultimately writing a song celebrating everything that gets you far in this game the friendships you make.Why do you all think I try so hard NOT to betray people even when it could get me further that season? It may be good in the short term but it will crush you in the long term.The large alliance is just a form of that the fact that the actual game is not one season but all seasons and the connections made during it. Its up to the newbies not to try and win their first season but to make the connections place themselves with people and be active enough so that they can work their way to doing well in future seasons.A game going on for this long with this many regular players cant just not have huge alliances. Thats not how it works. You guys need to stop thinking of seasons as separate but think of them as one big game with multiple winners every so often.Tagging relevant people uwafulking uawesomejoshua,TotalDramaTheGameshow,d70z3p5,1,t5_39jwl
