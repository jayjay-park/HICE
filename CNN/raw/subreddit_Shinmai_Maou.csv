5478309,0,t3_3pyzby,Alright....what? First off let me start by saying that I havent read much of the light novels so anything that was incorporated that I dont understand Im sorry. So anyway the scene with Basara and Chisato when Basara goes crazy Chisato calms him down by basically letting him do the do from the looks of it then all of a sudden they are back to reality? So Im kind of confused on that part. Second For some reason couldnt comprehend what the three High class Demon lords were talking about so if I could get some explanation on that. Third Why is it bad that Mio has to go back to the demon realm didnt quite understand that part either so if someone could explain please that would be a great help.,Shinmai_Maou,cwbwl9t,1,t5_35ret
