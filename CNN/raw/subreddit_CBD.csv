3882575,0,t3_34wgxf,The issue is that most industrial hemp products will be very low in CBD content  and thusly not very good if youre just going to smoke it or something. You can extract it though into oil and then cook it into food or baked goods just like you do with marijuana. The problem though is that butter extraction on the stovetop isnt going to yield good results I dont know why but butter seems to be a poor extractor for both CBD and THC despite its popularity and to get the best yield out of hemp youll need to ground it really fine and then cook it for a really long time at a very high ratio of hempoil. This is why hempbased CBD products suck a lot and you should NEVER EVER BUY THEM  its not actually that its impossible to derive goodquality product from industrial hemp its just that industrial hemp a tends to come from China and be full of chemicalsmetals and b the processes necessary to extract any meaningful amount of CBD from hemp are intensive and timeconsuming and most manufacturers dont want to do them or dont have the funds to set up the necessary equipment. So the answer is multifaceted hemp is weak the process is expensive hemp isnt ironically controlled as well as marijuana production and people are lazy.Its important to note too that industrial hemp that contains less than  THC and therefore is legal in the US isnt a naturally occurring phenomenon. Hemp in its natural state would contain both chemicals in similar amounts. In fact its possible that you cant buy hemp on the open market thats the original product since mankind has been fucking with the cannabis genome for a very very long time. You may be able to find some wild hemp and cultivate it yourself if you live in a state where that is possible but even then theres no guarantee that its actually naturally occurring not that that really matters at all. tldr  hemp is difficult to trust and just as unnatural as THC plants and thusly wont work for your purposes.    ,CBD,cqyui77,4,t5_2zppx

7861185,0,t3_4mrfju,Standard disclaimer as I make and sell CBD the following is for informative purposes only is not an endorsement of any specific use. Talk to your doctor before making health decisions.CBDa is just CBD with a weakly attached carboxyl group which is quickly cleaved off with exposure to any heat o acidity or basicness yielding regular CBD.Some folks think that this decarboxylation decarbing is necessary before ingestion to make cannabinoids active but this is just one of those stoner myths that gets born of halftruths and never seems to die.This is my standard reply to questions about needing to decarb THC. It provides more details. It applies to CBD as well the carboxly bond is just as fragile as with THC and in the same spot.gtThe whole decarbing thing is a stoner mythgtYes if you inject THCa into the brain of a mouse it will be inactive and if you inject the decarbed THC into a mouse brain it will be active. A study in the s came out that did just this and it made the stoner community assume that THCa would be inactive no matter how you ingested it which would mean that cannabis needs to be decarbed before use.gtBut that is a logical fallacy eating or vaping something is vastly different from injecting it directly into the brain The carboxyl groups bond to the last carbon ring of THCCBD is weak Any amount of o heat light acidity or basicness will break it. A dish of pure THCa in a dimly lit room will decarb after  hours. The reaction is so fast the secondary reaction of THCgtCBN will start to occur. No acidity just room temp and light. Dont take my word for it gtIts important to understand that the carboxyl group is very fragile because your stomach is filled with hydrochloric acid which is more than strong enough to cleave the carboxyl group from the cannabinoid. So if you eat it any THCa or CBDa it gets decarbed before it gets to your bloodstream. If you vape or smoke it the heat breaks the bond and its decarbed before it hits your blood stream. If you inject it into anywhere but the brain directly the heat of your blood as it flows through your veins will decarb it before it hits your brain. Basically any method of administration you choose except for intracerebral injection will assure that it is decarbed before it reaches your brain.gtCuring your bud if youre a grower is still good mind you it lets terps develop and breaks down the chlorophyls and tannins in the herb which smoothens the smoke or vape. But a simple dry and cure is sufficent it mostly decarbs anyway and the additional low temp heating in the oven decarbing just serves to degrade the THC into CBN and evaporate off the terps. Ditto if youre decarbing hash oil it was likely mostly decarbed anyway when it was purged if the base herb wasnt already decarbed from curing.Note For CBD heatoacidbases causes it to degrade into CBDL not CBN and it doesnt happen as fast as THCgtCBNgtBesides the science its easy to experimentally prove that THCa is decarbed in the stomach any grower can tell you that fresh undried buds are active when eaten. Though they weigh more than dried and cured bud due to water weight they are equally active. If you take a gram of fresh bud cure and decarb it the dried bud will have the same effects as a gram of undried bud but weigh half as much due to lack of water. People who try this however tend to think Oh gee I ate .g of dried bud and it got me as high as g of fresh it must be stronger cuz its decarbed instead of the correct .g dried got me as high as g fresh bc it has the same amount of cannabinoids it just weighed less bc it has no water which has helped to perpetuate the myth.gtTLDR decarbed or no almost any way you care to ingest it marijuana is active. The oldest edible recipes like Bhang call for fresh not decarbed bud! Your stomach is sufficient to decarb! A few hours in the air or sun is sufficient to decarb! Sometimes gazing too hard at your cannabis is enough to decarb! Thats how fragile the carboxyl groups bond with THCCBD is.,CBD,d3zo2ba,1,t5_2zppx

9450255,0,t3_5a5mke,Heres an extension of my understanding of the issue.mg administered orally is considered a sufficient dose to attenuate feelings of anxiety. Oral administration of CBD has very low bioavailability in comparison to smoking vaping. The two previous statements are based purely off of the numbers referred to in the source I linked in the main post.    Oil          for mg .mg    Vape Liquid  for mg .mg    mg with  bioavailability orally administered   mg dose.    mg with  bioavailability smoking vaping     mg dose.Therefore to attenuate anxiety ONE  sufficient dose of CBD costs the following    Oil     mg  .mg  .

CW does seem like one of the more trustworthy options.But even reading up here its overwhelming looking at what to get and to get it right.I see they have  different types  varying in potency. What do you recommend best for a person new to this to get? I already hear how potent CW and any tincture is i.e. when they say take  drops a day thats crazy when realistically I hear to only take .Would it make sense to get the lowest one CW everyday and take a few drops or would it be better to get CW Plus the middle tier mgml isntead of  and just take  to rd less of the drops? I guess the math works out the same but maybe for a new person taking less concentrated is better?Also do you split it up xday?

However maybe because these are domestic and more flower based there is a distinction?And could really be based on that it looks so much like mid grade hydroponic?This market is so interesting anyone have thoughts on how Kanapinis is fine into the US?Oh God and Goddess Universe and whole bless you Green Mountain!!If anything you and Dutch are the best and since your domestic I will definitely try you guys soon enough.  The only other next possible closest company in value is Bluebird with their x hemp complete.Your labs including heavy metalsfrom which Im detoxing and pricing are super top notch.

You will experience rebound anxiety significantly worse than your normal anxiety levels. This will taper off weeksmonths later. CBD oil can help Ive found but there are plenty of other things that help too.gt Magnesium citrate for anxiety and stress around  mg twice a day. Dont buy any other forms of magnesium as the absorption rate of citrate is the bestgt Magnesium spray for on your chest arms legs and feet. This could make you feel very relaxed and take away tension. Spray some when trying to sleep or when taking a nap its sticky be carefulgt HTP to relieve you of depressive feelings and to help you sleep ONLY if youre not using serotonergic drugs like SSRIs which could cause serotinin syndrome!. I forgot the dosing because Xanax fried my brain will let you know later.gt Not a supplement but a pretty harmless druggt Hydroxizine Atarax Vistaril  mg daily in divided doses to relieve anxiety and tension and to help you sleep. This is an antihistamine with sedative and anxiolytic properties. Not sure if safe in combination with HTP but you would want to try HTP first.

A few years agoWhat did you think? oh that might be interesting And then I did not look at it for a few months until my aunt initiated a CBDTHCtreatment for her fibromyalgia. So I started reading about it again. Have you tried using it? From that moment on I really wanted to try CBD. Which I did ASAP. Did it have the effect you hoped for? I wanted to relax because I have high muscletension and sometimes I felt really nervous and anxious.
