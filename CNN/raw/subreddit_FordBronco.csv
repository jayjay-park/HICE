Youll be MILES ahead buying a cheap daily driver and then buying the Bronco to fix up without driving itWanted one found one I live in the rust belt so it was a messNeeded a few immediate repairs and why not a  lift when buying tiresSo then the rust got the best of it and if some lift and tires is good why not more?Then the wheeling bug hit and well...And a slide show of its life,FordBronco,d7yy92g,3,t5_2tj7e
