Due to them being used as reference images its seems logical to enable the viewer to see as much detail as possible. That said a tripod would be required to enable low ISO higher fstop and slower shutter speed. ,Beginning_Photography,d3rtcka,2,t5_2ucib

8359240,0,t1_d5mclj9,The biggest and hardest thing I learned when I was shooting professionally was how to be forceful and speak up. Sometimes you have to look like an ass but that minute of uncomfortableness of taking control and clearing the background of unwanted people is so much better than the hours you might spend trying to photoshop someone out of the photograph. Plus it gets easier after awhile. One experience I had was while shooting a wedding outside of where a concert was being held. There were people everywhere and you would not believe how many people came up and interrupted my picture to ask the bride and groom did you just get married? That was the most forceful Ive ever had to be but when youre on a tight schedule you dont have time to wait for a hundred people to interrupt your shot. Anyway great picture youre on the right path!!

I realized once I started editing that they were not as well lit as I had thought. I was taking the pics from some distance I make sure and get closer next time. The newborn is my friends baby and she was basically just letting me practice. The baby was born  months early and is actually a month old in these pics still only weighing  pounds. The reason I got so few is once I started trying to re position her and move her to a different prop she decided to wake up wailing and protective mama swooped in and ended the session. So I used the pics I was able to actually take. How do you get happy awake newborn shots?,Beginning_Photography,d7twzte,0,t5_2ucib

9278237,0,t1_d8s2452,Yeah thats essentially it. In Aperture Priority you choose an aperture say youre shooting a portrait and you want the background to blur you choose the fastest your lens will go f. with your kit lens at mm and the camera will choose the shutter speed.

10118848,0,t3_5kt76t,Lighting is a key contributor to noise in digital images. This is directly related to the relationship between aperture shutter speed and ISO.Your mm lens most likely has a maximum aperture of f. at mm and f. at mm.The iPhone has a fixed aperture of f..So even though the iPhone has a smaller sensor it has a bigger aperture in relation to the sensor. This means it can get away with using a lower ISO in the same lighting conditions as your SLR. However since the sensor size is so small each pixel gathers less light and higher ISO has an exaggerated effect on the amount of visible noise.If the device detects that there is not enough light for the maximum Aperture then it will use a combination of higher ISO and longer shutter speeds to compensate. If you have your device in Auto then you dont get to pick which one it will choose to increase.The solutions are Fill your scene with more light.Get a lens with a larger aperture.Make sure to stay near the wide angle of your zoom range for the largest available aperture.Use a longer shutterspeed so that the ISO does not need to go up as high. For video you want your shutter speed to be roughly double the framerate. So about th of a second if youre shooting at  framespersecond.,Beginning_Photography,dbqhrvj,1,t5_2ucib

The imaging sensor can only do contrast detect autofocus. Its slower and tends to hunt more. Autofocus is snappier when using the viewfinder.Also on the D when you take an image in live view the mirror flips down first then bounces up before the shutter fires. Its slower to take a picture in LV mode because of the double mirror flip. This happens on other entry level Nikon cameras as well.

11608502,0,t3_65mh02,I would use a wide angle lens to do a time lapse and would choose a high vantage point hill neighbouring building etc to see all the action in the ground.  Also i would take a lot more pictures than  a day and more or less at the same hour. Because can you imagine if you have the video constantly switching light from morning to midday to afternoon to sunset but very fast and repeating for every single day? You wont be able to see anything and it will give you a headache.I would suggest doing a test with a lego model or even just a table with stuff you can try to photograph it using the settings you are planning to use changing every day a few things and after a week making a mini time lapse to see if the speed etc looks how you want it.I would try to take pic per min during  hours each the day. With time lapse I think is better to have too many photos  than too few. You can always delete photos that you dont need later.Pick a spot with good light to place your tripod where the sun is high and facing the building to avoid shadows in it as it grows. The important thing is that the camera is in the same exact place every day. Work out a way of placing it back to the same point.Edit words,Beginning_Photography,dgbu0x7,2,t5_2ucib
