1604357,0,t1_cjhe22w,Its am and Im still bleary eyed after waking up from a stressful dream so this is hardly an adequate thanks but thank you. Edit also you have the writing style of a friend of mine who I havent talked to in a long time. We used to email back and forth philosophies and missives about a secret society we had created hail the high members of the Triad although in retrospect he was a much greater wit and rhetorician than I. Thanks for making me remember that. ,Mydaily3,cjhebjy,3,t5_32vii
1606639,0,t1_cjhb2t8,I second this but also for someone like me or apparently OP the act of asking would be a huge weight off of his chest.  You get rejected. Its part of life. OP rose above his stated endless passivity and put himself out there.  Sucks she said no but this man is a beautiful butterfly now!,Mydaily3,cjhonkc,6,t5_32vii

1628753,0,t3_2cxp7v, Apparently I was invisible in high school because a former classmate didnt recognise me. Whatever I guess.  I went to a party that sucked. I left early because of how much it sucked. A comment on a Reddit thread made me laugh out loud in public. That laugh was very much needed. ,Mydaily3,cjkgwdm,1,t5_32vii

1897023,0,t1_ckhk4kg,Are you pleased with the dress you got? Last time I went to a wedding I used it as an excuse to buy a dress I didnt need but loved. It was a little out of my normal price range but I did it for the wedding.Im going to wear it on a date with my boyfriend next month so at least it was worth it.,Mydaily3,ckhs5ck,2,t5_32vii

4547285,0,t3_3d8jxq, Slept from pm until about pm. Its been a weird day. If Im tired Im just going to try to sleep at midnight or . If not Ill push myself to stay up as late as I can and keep pushing the sleep schedule forward. I think I might have sat and played XCOM for a ridiculous amount of time last night while I was looking for something to keep me awake. Tried drinking coffee last night. Gave me a stomachache but nothing worse than that. Progress? Its been like  and a half months since I could properly enjoy coffee. And pizza! Had a huge craving for pizza this evening. Realized that I in no way could possibly handle any more than maybe one or two slices if that. So no pizza yet. Cant rush things because thatll just upset my guts again and send me back to square one.,Mydaily3,ct3t6q9,1,t5_32vii
4857457,0,t3_3harnv, When I got up grandma mentioned to me that she had to take a hit of her medicine. I have been a little concerned that shes feeling worse than she admits. I think I might stay until Wednesday when my sister and her husband get back from their trip just to make sure shes okay and will have someone here to help her if she needs it. Went grocery shopping with grandma. As grumpy and antisocial as she can be she does know a lot of people in this town so she ended up talking with a few for a while. On the way back home we passed my cousin and her daughters who were riding their horses near her parents place on the next property over from my grandma. Pulled over and chatted with her for a bit. Her parents are kinda sorta feuding with grandma its a long story that I dont want to really get into the details of but suffice to say grandma and my uncle have not been on good terms for a while  yes while living next door to each other. My cousins in that branch of the family are pretty much caught in the middle of their dispute. I dont think any of them hold any malice towards grandma and she definitely doesnt towards them. But theres really no way for them to spend time with grandma without causing a big stink from their parents. Sad really. Grandma did offer to allow the horses to be housed in her field in the fall to help with the cost of feeding them since their should still be plenty of hay the guy leasing the field is very much understocking it which is nice because the last guy waaaaay overstocked it.,Mydaily3,cu6thwk,1,t5_32vii

6742594,0,t3_47ub7k, Slept in as is only good and right for a Saturday. Feeling better as the day has gone on. Took it very easy today. Ended up playing video games for most of it really. Weirdly enough only got dressed around midnight just to go sit around the firepit in the backyard with my roommate and a few of his friends that were over.,Mydaily3,d0gqpnm,2,t5_32vii
7003370,0,t1_d19v15m,The time change definitely sucks. My sleep schedules already offkilter without shifting the hours around. I can only imagine a little one would have an even worse time coping with it. Good luck with all of the stuff. Hopefully the med change will help. Hopefully theres no complications and your doctor will make it an official change if it works.,Mydaily3,d1a6db2,2,t5_32vii
7203174,0,t3_4e0r1o,  Long day o work and I got work at  am in the morning. It will be good having pm to the end of the day free though.  Trying to learn all the basic chinese grammar. A or something. Acct systems is annoying me its easy but I cant seem to do well on exams.

8536767,0,t3_4wkazd, Slept in. Why are weekends so short? Thought about going to the mall and tracking down an old album by my favourite artist and possibly one by the band that opened for him back in March the big HMV at West Ed is likely my best bet for finding those albums just on the shelf and not ordering them. In the end decided that I was too broke and too lazy to put on clothes and leave the house especially before the mall closed. Why does everything shut down so early on Sundays here?. Lazed around and played video games all day. Friends decided to bust out some Mario Kart which I probably havent touched in like a year. Was pretty fun. I like a lot of Wii U games the problem is that I just dont seem to hop into them with friends as easily as PC games these days.,Mydaily3,d68nv0k,2,t5_32vii

9223871,0,t3_56lm74, Spent the morning preparing food cake etc. It was difficult getting stuff done with the kids the little one was very cranky today. I am very pleased with how the cake turned out.  People came over in the afternoon for the party. It was a little awkward as our families sort of gathered separately. Its not terribly unusual mostly because of the age difference but it felt weirder than usual given the circumstances. Luckily everyone was aware of our separation before the party but remained civil ex told his mother yesterday halfsister was informed by me and former FIL. My former FILs wife gave me a big hug when she left and told me she loves me and wants to continue to see me from time to time. Were very different but shes always been nice to me. The girls had a great party. They loved the cake the food the decorations and the gifts. They were very spoiled. Overall I would say it was a success.,Mydaily3,d8l6zhc,4,t5_32vii

10219230,0,t3_5m5lok, Worked all day on editing my thesis in accordance with supervisors comments. It can be very frustrating at times and progress was very much in short bursts rather than a continuous stream. Ended up staying until pm. Still more stuff to do tomorrow. Getting close to being done with this round I hope. Then I really need to throw a presentation together and start practicing it. When trying to edit a formula in word it kept crashing. Took that as my sign to call it a night. Came home grabbed a quick supper and played Overwatch with my friends. Debating trying to edit stuff here before going to bed but I think Ill leave it until tomorrow. Hopefully my work computer wont keep crashing on me.,Mydaily3,dc2eo8o,2,t5_32vii
11271341,0,t1_df9kw9q,The house is great. The location isnt. Its a nice neighborhood but were  min from a bigger town and  min from the city. People dont want that kind of commute.

11485980,0,t3_63s087, More work more number crunching most of the day. Took a break midday and went and graded some undergrad capstone projects. Sure beats sitting at the desk all day.

Hopefully with it raining today some of the instability will settle down and I wont get a midday storm headache tomorrow.,Mydaily3,dfxxn70,2,t5_32vii
