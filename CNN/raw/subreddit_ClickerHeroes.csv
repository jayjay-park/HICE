1744629,0,t1_cjz2byu,That is quite a valid point but I was just trying to add some ways to scale harder into late game since here like in every single idle game as levels progress the difficulty ramps up harder and adding some more utilities for HS could help. Maybe the skill durationcooldown thing was a bit over the top for people who dont play the game like I do but improving skill effects could be a good thing in my opinion. And yes I like to let Clicker Heroes progress as Im smoking a cigarrete writing cooking cleaning studying or whatever it is. There have always been games that were meant to be played on second plane not the same type of game but tell me if you ever played ogame actively besides in the first levels and for multiplayer interaction because in the end even if activity gets you higher yields than afking there are hours and hours of grind behind this game. I dont think a  year old could be as good as if you had  cooldowns finding which is the fastestoptimal way to progress would require some thinking and its not like waiting for EnergizeDRReload to get DPS or not being able to get new upgrades until Golden Clicks pops up is a completely polished way to progress where Im at now and a  year old could do it as well.EDIT I realize that maybe thats not how you like to play the game and probably its not how the developers want it to be as they most probably will want you to actually play the game instead of letting it work by itself. Even though I bet Im not the only one playing it this way sometimes which doesnt mean that I wont be playing it actively at some point. And well besides all this discussion about how the game is meant to be played I think some of the bonuses for skills could be helpful in late game or if not given by HS which could be broken a  effect to some skills in the form of some late game hero upgrade could be a different thing more balanced and more according to your playstyle as well. Lastly please respect other playstyles. A game is a tool which you can use as you prefer and just because you like to use it in a certain way it doesnt mean that theres no other way. Its the same kind of discussion as playing withwithout cheats mods etc. Its not like the devs hate this they wouldnt have implemented Progression mode if they were against it.,ClickerHeroes,cjz2lf2,1,t5_32820

1809820,0,t3_2f9vkb,I have been playing since . was first put on Kongregate then when there were no updates for a while I moved to the main site.I have been using autoclicker from the beginning but I also left the game idle for extended amounts of time at the beginning. On that note while using autoclickers breaks the game at the beginning by Lv  even with the upgrades they become mostly useless for normal farming though they retain their usefulness when it comes to overhitting bosses using skills. Overall I dont think you need to worry about them much not to mention they are much healthier for your mouse. PI would say the only problem I see with the progression at the moment is that around Lv  the gold income vs. damage output required drops drastically and while the new update helps a little pulling up lowlevel heroes to the point where they can contribute visible amounts of damage even with the xx multipliers just takes too much gold. I would recommend either reducing the global costincrease of leveling you could try tying it to an achievement for example or adding new highend heroes after Frostleaf.Also if we are at feedback relating heroes I think you should add a few bufferheroes between Shinatobe Grant and Frostleaf as currently a Lv  of one easily outperforms a Lv  of the previous one and Frostleaf just makes everything but Lv  range heroes useless.Finally I can see what you tried to do by nerfing Golden Clicks but the only thing you achieved is that I am not using it anymore at all because it is pointless. Please unnerf it so that it would do at least  even on bosses as right now it is practically useless.Thats all. ,ClickerHeroes,ck79ac9,2,t5_32820

1920993,0,t1_ckknxil,My bad. Sorry to be so unrelenting. You make a great point everything is changing. I agree with you there and with my frustration at the destruction this patch wreaks on early game I forgot that.With that happier note in mind I can easily see several methods to quickly fix this to benefit newer players and challenge later players. I was too focused on my issues to look at it broadly most of the base here is looking at ways to increase endgame DPS and gain so the devs are looking at fixing that first.Edit because this doesnt really deserve a separate comment thread at this point Removing the gold bonus and nerfing the DPS makes ascending again longer. I really dont want to do research because Im very lazy but I would be interested in numbers. The gist is no gold bonus plus mitigated DPS bonus means slower gains. If I choose an ancient that doesnt increase gold gain Im hitting a linear increase in DPS. Against an exponential HP growth in enemies this is beneficial in the shortterm. This was true before the patch of course. You progress until you cant hit well enough. However you were also gaining more gold which affected the exponential drop rate from enemies. Overall you did negligibly more damage for an increased rate of gold. Now you do even more negligibly damage for no gold increase. You see an immediate benefit for the first X stages where X drops off really fast see linear v. exponential curves.Furthermore if you do choose the ancient that increases gold drops you now have to invest more for reduced gains. Might be more ancients that influence this I currently have access to one and I havent checked the wiki. With the exponential cost of leveling the ancient you have to spend more souls meaning more ascends to reach the same or lower? level of production. Put this together with reduced DPS and no extrareduced gold gain and youre looking at a longer ascension arc.uFragsworth I would be very interested at this point for some input. Im just throwing out some basic calculations almost at random so Im curious what the devs are thinking. As above at this point not complaining now just critiquing and curious.,ClickerHeroes,ckknzs0,3,t5_32820

If you have  million souls and put them all into morgulis you get . per soul for a total of  dps increase.gtalso the way scientific notation works also means gold is irrelevant after a certain pointthere will become a point where you could not advance high enough to even EARN gold so you quickly spiral into need an infinite amount of time to cast Dark ritual ever  minutes at x power to beat the next monster.The entire game stops working at all somewhere around zone  i believe.

2159734,0,t1_clebbf3, bonus to dps while idle HS  SiyaYes there is a chance for rerolls.  Thats just a situational variable.  That doesnt mean that you should stockpile at the very start or that its ever a good idea as a default practice.Theres zero risk in rerolling to see what you can get so long as you export first.  But if you had lets say  HS youd have to reroll  times without Siya coming up for it to actually hurt your current dps.  If you got Siya any time within  rerolls you would still have at least a  combined dps bonus instead of .Clicking with skills is always better dmg than idle until later on if you have high Siya and little to nothing in BhaalFrags.  But having  bonus to idle dps is going to get you to whatever wall you hit a lot faster than a  clicking bonus.  And once you hit that wall  dps on a full skill burst isnt going to amount to as much as you make it sound for pushing ahead an extra boss or two.  ,ClickerHeroes,cleco7z,1,t5_32820

2284428,0,t3_2la7ru,So the way i see ClickerHeroes is there heroes that band together go on an adventure to slayer monsters. Monsters drop gold which you use to upgrade your heroes. During their adventure they come across bosses which they defeat and sometimes when they defeat the bosses they receive the souls of heroes the boss has killed. With the hero souls you acquire you sacrifice them to an ancient which grants you bonus powers. I am pretty happy with this story and how balanced the game is right now from early to late game. The issue is now how to add new content without breaking the balance. I have many suggestions which you can take and mold to how you see fit.  Item Drops. As of right now monsters drop gold and bosses occasionally drop hero souls. However if we were to base this on a classic RPG game monsters dont just drop gold. Sometimes monsters drop items or ingredients. items could bones slime eyes fur hide armor pieces blade shards This will lead me in to my next suggestion.  Crafting. You can use the items you gather to combine into weapons armor potions relics someone mentioned this previously This can open up new paths for the game can take. Examples are you can equip items on to heroes to give them a special bonus. Items can be specific to certain heroes. Im sure people could come up with more ideas for this.  Summoning. We already see some bosses have hero souls. We can infer from this that there have been previous heroes that have been defeated. Perhaps there are heroes too strong to be destroyed and instead have been put into a dormant state. That mean we have the opportunity to free them to use them to kill stronger monsters. There can be a series of task to revive the hero such as acquiring his armor weapon and his soul. Another creature we can summon are pets. Pets could be summoned from ingredients gathered from monsters. The pets then can be equipped to a hero to give a special bonus such as for Cid you have a toggle affect that clicks  every  seconds for people who like to use juggernaut. You can make the ingredients for pets difficult to acquire so to keep the early game balanced.   StrengthsWeaknesses to monsters. As of right now the monsters neutral in the sense of strength and weakness. A way to provide more dynamics to the game what about  introducing attributes to monsters. An example is Slimes are weak to magic and strong against physical attacks. So mage heroes have their dps doubled against slime monsters but all the DPS that isnt magic is cut in half. You could just implement with bosses instead of regular monsters to not make the program intensive with the calculations. You can calculate by either increasing or decreasing the base hp of bosses.   Specific Area clicking. You can add this to fighting bosses where you are facing Tako the octopus and you click on his tentacles x number of clicks to remove his tentacle which cuts his hp by x . You can also introduce click combos where when you click on a certain area of a boss it exposes another area to be clicked and so on so that when the combo finishes to inflict bonus damage. I feel these suggestion could further game in providing more content for the clicker to access. I tried to make these suggestions general in the sense that it is possible to combine this with other suggestions mentioned on this thread and previous threads. can use this to add new heroes transcendence buffs etctldr Suggestions  Monsters drop items ingredients.  Craft items armor weapons potions.  Summon new heroes and pets.  Bosses have strengths and weaknesses.  Click in specific areas to give bonus damage. ,ClickerHeroes,clu2lyq,1,t5_32820

Later on instead of  in Broyle Id just do  since I was holding z anyhow and Im literally that lazy half the time I wouldnt even go back and buy the heroes for souls since ascending every  minutes gave so many more souls it really isnt worth the bother.Now its more along the lines of buy  of whatever I can afford hit the buy all skills button and spend hero souls buy  of we I can afford and  of the few heroes that have  skills skill button once I have my skills do a in my case passive oriented       combo.

If the dps is negligible because youre instantly killing monsters with or without the x or without idle... then the fact that your idle gold x will be at a much higher level will be more prominent in the calculations and this is where Thusia and golden clicks would be useful for an idle build even with a relatively low level Thusia you can get a x multiplier on chestsI didnt factor in edr or normal dps anyhow because it all scales with the exception of using the gold youre earning to purchase more heroes.  The main reason this is important to acknowledge is if you get another x or x multiplier to your dps before idle kicks back in the gold you gain in the  seconds is considerably higher than what you would have made in the  seconds broken idle time.All of this of course is at a point in the game where gold helps at all once you hit the  limit on your gilded hero its just powersurge and edr but even with no gold ancients the run to  had more than  of the damage coming from FL levels beyond .,ClickerHeroes,cm26ccg,2,t5_32820

Reroll your ancient lottery until you find ancients that would be helpful. If you click a lot youll want Juggernaut Fragsworth and Bhaal. If you just try and let the dps take you through a level you should try and get Siyalatas and Libertas. My suggestion is that you just get a few ascensions done then buy an ancient.

The advantage of Thusia is that when youre powerleveling with golden clicks activated then you get more time on treasure chests  gold bonus minimum up to thousands of times gold bonus depending on Mimzee.  So every second you spend golden clicking on a treasure chest is worth thousands of times as much gold as every second you spend clicking on a normal mob.Once you have serious points in MimzeeDora then any nontreasure chest kill is irrelevant.

3579848,0,t1_cq0946t,I didnt say that time is an irrelevant factor. I said that time to get  gilds by doing a deep run when considering buying them for rubies is. When spending rubies the only thing youre interested in is to get the maximum bonus from them not how long it would take you to get that bonus without rubies.  doesnt become better than . just because it would take a longer playtime to get the  from playing normally. You only compare the value of the ruby purchase to another ruby purchase not to normal runs.Yes by spending rubies on gilds you can spend them more often. However were interested in long term goals not short term. A strategy that takes us to M souls in a week but M souls in a month is worse than one that takes us to M souls in two weeks but M souls in a month. Buying smaller bonuses more often wont be better than buying a big bonus less often if the bigger bonus is even remotely bigger unless we can make up for the difference using the extra supplies we get from the smaller one. Given that the bonus were talking about here is for DPS the  bonus we get from gilds will only amount to a fraction of a percentage of bonus to our souls per hour rate if any change at all. Also were still only calculating for the worst possible scenario for the souls spending them on one single ancient. I do believe that there are situations where gilds are worth more to purchase but overall I think quick ascensions are better way more often.

I know it sucks but Im at that point too I have maxed out Vaagur and Im never using the skills because they just slow me down quick ascensions are what you want and as soon as you slow down you ascend again until you get a nice bunch of HS then you start building other things with every ascension...

3601715,0,t3_31lvxc,. AscencionsYou really need to do faster ascencions... If youve been playing in this run for  days you must really ascend now.Try to ascend when you feel youre not or almost not instakilling the monsters. When the game slows down ascend. This way you will farm hero souls faster and then you get to higher zones very fast.. Hero SoulsNever spend ALL hero souls in ancients except Morgulis wich is not the case. If you have morgulis spend all the souls you dont use for other ancients to him. He works like the Hero Souls bank but have a  multiply by each hero soul and the souls in the bank have got only  by each HSAlmost ancients increaces the effecience of HS and with no HS at all these ancients like siyalatas cant do almost nothing.I think its better to respec so you get some HS wish will help your runs to be faster.I used a respec in your acount and you started to instakilling again monsters until zone  in your runs you can go a little bit deeper but dont go to much you will slowdown very fast.. GildsGilds are more effecient if they are in only one hero. In your case put all your gilds in masked samurai.But you dont have many hero souls so dont put all the gilds in one run. Put maybe  gilds in this run then when you get enough HS put some more. If you put all the gilds now you run out of HS and it would cause the same problem it caused for ancients.When you can get samurai in level  without slowing down the run regild into Atlas.. AncientsThis depends if you want an active build or an idle build do not use both builds at same time it would be very ineficient. I presume you want an idle build for your post.The two most important idle ancients are siyalatas and libertas. Get them as soon as you can. Do not get active ancients these that increase clicking or abilities. The best formula for siyalatas is siyalatas  morg in your case siyalatas  bank.. For the other ancients like libertas its better to see a calcultator like this Other ancients you should get are Atman more chance to get primal boss amp Solomon more HS per primal boss for a bost in HS farming Kumawakamaru less monsters per zone faster run argaiv bigger bost for gilds  more damage per level morgulis  damage per level so each soul invested gets  more than if it was in the bankAnd then get the other ancients except the active build ones that arent usefull.

3932073,0,t3_35haky,Bubos and Fortuna  seems pretty premature which is a pretty big problem at your stage in the game since it makes the next ancients so damn expensive for you. Your next ancient should probably be Mimzee as getting Morg would be very early getting Atman wont mean a whole lot until you can get Solomon as well and Argaiv doesnt do a lot before you start regilding which judging by the zone you ascend you probably have not done yet. I would however check the calculator to see what would be the optimal way to get both Mimzee and Atman since it might be cheaper to get both of them by buying Atman first and not having to reroll rather than rerolling twice to get Mimzee and then maybe rerolling a couple of times more to get Atman. The calculator will be able to tell you this at least if you copy your save data into it. If you dont want to mess with the calculator you can always try saving your game and experimenting and reload the game again if you dont get the desired outcome. Anyways you should probably keep levelling Dora Libertas Mammon and Siya a bit more so you wont put yourself way back by spending a big part of your bank on a new ancientsince Mimzee requires  of your bank to buy.,ClickerHeroes,cr4hpju,3,t5_32820

4358693,0,t3_3axyr8,Im at the same level as you and the best thing to do is to restart at Stage  and push a little further each time with your boosts just before you want to reset. When you hit Frostleaf Level  youll need to go back to your TreeBeast and get him to Level  to start boosting your DPS from then onwards. At that point you will be able to start passing Stage  without having to use your boosts. Continue upwards in a similar fasion.From what Ive read from the guides on here keep your Hero Souls at SiylatasLevel  HS  lvl  Siylatas in the early game.For every  Siyalatas you have you want to have  Libertas . ratio this is true for every stage of the game. ,ClickerHeroes,csgyhjw,1,t5_32820

So if the gilds are right at the moment save  rubies just in case or save the HS required.

4917116,0,t1_cuec26e,Thank you  Yes and more settings to adjust. The current beta deep run there actually can use EDR ER combos and skills after ER combo for  minutes properly if you leave it with autoclicker at   dps running without touching your screen with all skills available at the moment of going on a deep run it would work for hours smoothly if you never touch your mouse at all. Thats what I tested yesterday when I went from my optimal zone  to  XD Sikulix doesnt click by itself that fast but at least it keeps Juggernaut combo by clicking every  seconds or so. So a separate simple autocliking program is needed to use with it.gti think you have a typo on line ...it says Goes on a deep run with skills usage if True and if Settings.CheckForAscend was set to True shouldnt it be if Settings.CheckForAscend was set to FALSE ? No its not a typo. You see the name of the setting is Deep Run INSTEAD of Ascension. It just replaces the ascension procedure that would be started by Settings.CheckForAscend  True. So you can start a normal run this way which will end with a deep run when you slow down. But now its easier to just set a ForcedDeepRun setting to True when youre ready to go after running the script.,ClickerHeroes,cuec9i5,1,t5_32820

4931198,0,t1_cug3kdm,Thing he isnt factoring in is time taken.  minutes of clicking after  minutes is  minute runs the last  minutes youre averaging much less zonesminute due to one crit kills.If I go a few hundred zones above my optimal Im likely to only get about .m instead of my usual m or so. Keep in mind my runs are  minutes netting me m and change per hour. Now if you just went say a minute and a half and ran your combo youre going to be basically  click killing and then instakilling through the combo adding a slight gain to the combos significant gain. However downside is you may have to wait for idle especially in cases where youre starting your main hero or have a high Iris which basically could completely and more efficiently if youre attentive equate to your clicking ancient investment and add a greater hshr multiplier.

So I think in the past I did the same thing.Right now with overlevled Iris when I get a clickable after ascneding even if Idle mode is working and if I put everything into Cadmia Alabaster isnt avaliable for buying aster ascending unless Id use Midas start it starts to kill very very slowly so it takes some time before I start instakilling.But yes if Iris is optimal   or even as recommended optimal   then such a problem wont happen with a need to have more than one gild on a transitional hero ,ClickerHeroes,cukyti0,1,t5_32820

5086668,0,t1_cuywucq,It changes the nature of the game when your choices can be easily revoked and rearranged. The cost isnt a balancing point so much as a deterrent.Theres a difference between fixing a mistake or making a longterm change in strategy and constantly switching strategies optimizing for every situation. For example frontloading a run with Iris then shifting those souls into idle ancients until you stop instakilling then shifting all those souls into active ancients and pushing as far as is efficient. That would be a more powerful strategy but really annoying to perform every ascension so the game should discourage it. As a general rule of game design players shouldnt feel like they have to choose between the most efficient strategy and the most fun way to play.,ClickerHeroes,cuz4x5l,2,t5_32820

5187306,0,t1_cshlv39,I recently found the mobile version and couldnt believe CH was partnered with them I hope the developers did their homework before deciding this because what you said above isnt everything.R hosts a lot of browser based games made by chinese developers who rip off from known games but also from developers of other browser based games. The idea behind that is releasing a game promoting non stop launch hundreds of servers to grab the highest amount of whales possible then move to the next game. The result is atrocious they even keep games that do not have any more support end up full of bugs and lie to their players promising that they are working on it so players keep playing and spending afterall you can always grab a new player willing to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars. When some games do not  have enough whales after a while they go to the bottom of the support list which means good luck to you if you have any problem most likely it will take forever to get an answer and possibly it will be just a default msg or something that makes you wonder if they even speak English ir just use google to translate.Integrity?Well the guy who founded RGames is Jared Psigoda who years ago was the self proclaimed king of gold farmers. He started making his fortune buyingsellingtrading accounts and later hiring chinese gold farmers in WoW. You can find videos of him talking about that and his presentation about how to catch . whales if you have the stomach for it.Of course it may work very well for Clicker Heroes but take a look at City of Steam. They devs had the game running fine and decided to partner with RGames. Immediately the community raged because of R reputation but they assured it would be fine even Jared itself but it didnt take long...R decided to shut down because of chronic lack of players. very weird considering they have games that are nearly dead with players spending a lot still and City of Team was rereleased later.Too bad CH is with them well guess there are other games out there.,ClickerHeroes,cvb9dya,1,t5_32820

6038504,0,t1_cyalqcq,Deliberately avoiding death by taking short quests or abusing the calculator isnt as helpful as you think and is considered to be probably the worst form of cheating before editing your save file.  So its still not really gamechanging.   Save file editing has been possible since before I started playing in . probably a lot longer than that.  And IIRC devs opinion on it is that people can play however they want.  It also helps when people lose their data from insufficient backups or whatever reason.  Its not as useful as you think it would be even if you abuse the calc.  A lvl  Legendary rubies merc gives  rubies for a  day quest.  That sounds like a lot but it isnt going to get you more than a day or twos worth of ascensions spending it on QA.  A transcendent lvl  will get you  but again youre cheating to do it and you still have to spend an hour spending it on QAs for it to be useful.

I didnt want to offend you by saying your work is lazy but from what Ive seen the problems lie with effects given by high rarity like Mythical and greater. Rubies being the general currency for goods in game shouldnt really be a mercs bonus to rewards just like there is no relics ability now. Same goes with Recruitment mercs  anything above  in time reduction doesnt really make sense as the gap between fabled and mythical in this regard is huge  fabled recruits in h and Myth in  secs.

6268012,0,t3_41fnrh,Thusia is weird. It is not tied to any single ancient for the purposes of level scaling anywhere and is mostly a matter of preference.Because for semideep hybrid runs I keep using the following combo.  gain floors phase wait  mins.  gain Thusia money phase  partial floors wait  minsI plan to go get more than a lvl  Thusia. Maybe stick it at .Typically on Hybrids I let it idle until I hit a floor where I do kills for  second each after which Ill keep monitoring until it is impossible to level stuff up without being able to instakill common mobs. Then I go unleash the combo detailed above.The first one is for gaining a few levels the other for gaining cash that would be very hard to get on later floors due to scaled enemy HP. Golden clicks what with leaking a few gold per click solves that problem especially if you get to land on a chest while you have very low crit damage.All in all this setup is worthwhile if you dont really play actively since you can always go back to it every few minutes gain a few halfcenturion levels and AFK doing other things.

7195630,0,t1_d1w2fo7,Id just like to chime in on the we dont get enough Ancient Souls for the progress weve made issue. First and foremost this is a brand new mechanic and will of course be subject to an enormous amount of testing and rebalancing but in principle it feels very similar to the way ascensions were perceived after hero souls and ancients were first added to the game.People who had made it to zone  at the time of that update were understandably upset that they werent getting many more HS for the time they invested compared to players at or near z. And its easy to feel frustrated at first but heres the thing we need to remember. Transcending will initially start off as a very slow irregular process for everybody.Eventually we might reach a point where its optimal to transcend rather than ascend once a day but for now its probably not something anyone will do again until after at least a month.

But at high TP it could be hundreds or thousands of times more HS.  Adding to this longer duration actives and higher Kuma actually benefit active even more.  I feel like Idle needs a third ancient a Jugg equivalent like extra DPS based on time spent inactive.  Or Xyl needs to increase more in power each rank.

Then you can work on getting people like Atman Solomon Dogcog and a few Im forgetting. Atman is great but they are only good if you can progress far enough to be worthwhile and have the souls to max exponential cost increase not additive!.Also dont get Iris... she isnt useful until you can level her a ton. I wouldnt get Iris until you have enough HS to get her to level  or at minimum . Just my opinion skipping  levels is useless while  is much better.edit Also I wouldnt spend on regilding until you can get more souls per ascension. I regilded mine at  about  spent and then that pushed me up to  so far. For now just let them stay where they are. Then you can try to get them on Treebeast Ivan Brittney Samurai and Great Forest Seer.

Introducing a new multiplier to your damage formula will make the damage increase much faster than if you had just increased one of your current multipliers.  For example compare these two scenarios where we increase Siyalatas and Argaiv by  levels.  Xyliqil| Siyalatas | Argaiv | Morgulis | Product|||| |  |  | e | .e |  |  | e | .e |  |  | e | eDo you see how the damage multiplier increased a lot more when increasing Argaiv than when increasing Siyalatas?

You will blame it on the extra AS.   You built the sim and it failed to accurately put in mercs which is like drawing a map of the solar system without the sun.  And when given the option to prove yourself you cant be bother to come up with a build by plugging into your own sim?   Your sim doesnt show merc ascensions doesnt have hybrid and you havent even updated it or at least the bs numbers you just posted because it says  hrs for the  AS at  and it is .AStime which is super easy to beat.I get it though you are just arrogant and when someone proves you wrong you cant handle it.   ,ClickerHeroes,d6h9qq3,1,t5_32820

Collecting a quest early even something like a  quest can easily skip more than one ascension at a time if done properly. Straight up skipping ascensions is going to greatly increase your ASday which should be the most important factor to any decision you make.unalk should be able to go into greater detail. Before he started cheating autoclicker and merc lister he was transcending every  hours for  AS. If your strategy can beat that then sure yours may be better. I doubt it though.For added proof that merc ascensions throughout your run is better... I dont save mine until the end but instead collect  after every ascension.

By then you definitely have all the ancients Im not worried about that particular possibility in regards to the first run. What Im worried about with that is that everyone is going to choose the one best ancient in the game which would likely be sniperino. Of course if it starts you off at level  it would take a lot of forge cores to get sniperino in a good place though less so if other aspects of what Im saying would get implemented.Then again sniperino might not be the best if I had my way. Id probably make relic bonuses for ancients be things like  of solomons level. Thatd make it very worthwhile while still keeping it from ever becoming more important than the ancient itself and still make it so people would want to increase solomon.

That is why I think it is a joke to say to revive them all up to a certain point because a great  of those will die really soon and you wont get much more from them anyways.  At this point and I play a lot at the keyboard or close enough to frequently check I can barely keep enough with each trans to have a QA and maybe a timelapse to help finish some merc quests to start a new trans rather than waiting  more hours etc.  If I was reviving everything people say I should be Id have to take out a ruby loan and if the interest was in rubies Id never be able to pay it back.  It doesnt help either when you have Revolc up to  and click  straight and get nothing.  I swear Ive gotten more rubies at the beginning of my last few trans than I have gotten the last half of them.

10560674,0,t1_dd54dab,I see what you are saying and I can go offline for a good amount of time at the beginning of an ascension. I can see how I can get offline progression later in the game too. But I dont see why this sort of thing should be restricted to the end game. gtMy solution for you and OP either play long enough to get what you want or save edit to the end I dont think either of us want to do that. Isnt there supposed to be something interesting about the existing progression in the game? I dont want to skip major parts of the game. I already have a workaround. I play the mobile version on a tablet. So I have an app that keeps it awake and I have it plugged in. I can largely ignore it through most of ascension you know like in an idle game. But thats just silly. Why cant I just turn the screen off? Theres no reason for that except for the programming. And its not like there wouldnt be disadvantages to playing that way. During your ascension you can only put ACs on heroes that are visible so you can easily stop autokilling if you dont check in. Also you arent going to be using the mercs as efficiently as possible.I think I might be missing something here though. Does something else happen when the game is turned off? Does Nogardnit become more powerful? Im not following how allowing the ACs to continue while offline causes the problems you are talking about. I dont see the difference here the difference is the gap between keeping the game on and running to get the x multipliers and setting the AC on a hero and running is huge.I set the AC on the hero at x so that it buys the hero on the x multipliers. Why does it matter if the screen is on or not while this is happening?,ClickerHeroes,dd566ug,2,t5_32820

But try to go for kuma values like     getting your cap down farmig your cap transcend.A while back I was transcending in  ascension and farming all my AS in the last ascension going from . Now I finish my nd to last with  AS cause I drop my cap and then MA. Then finish the trans with another short ascension with TL.The strategies are so complex and different. My longest ascension is now my th out of  with a hm and it feels kinda long so Im trying to shorten that one even more.,ClickerHeroes,ddqeddi,1,t5_32820

And the fastest way to do that is with Phan until it hits about .At some point youll feel that you are transcending quickly enough and then its time to up Borb.  After a while youll find that the TP gain from your number of AS outweighs Phan.And then further on youll find that increasing Chor Pony beyond  to be the easiest way to bring your transcension time under  hours.,ClickerHeroes,dfe42gu,1,t5_32820
