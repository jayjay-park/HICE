9327207,0,t1_d8y9eob,Ill take a read thanks for sharing!As for the drawing test I wasnt made to do that by my neuro. In certain angles I have very little control over my hand but I can still draw and write. I just have to hold the pen pencil in a particular way. I often find myself resting my hand on something else too,EssentialTremor,d8yaita,2,t5_2v0b0
10683885,0,t3_5scqr1,There is hope.  Mine started in .  Hasnt progressed much.  I will be  this year.  Everyone is different.  One good mental habit is to remember that yesterday and the past are history.  Tomorrow and the future is a mystery.  Today this instant is the only time we are able to do anything about ET.  So today I am eating brain healthy exercising meditating going to yoga reading and chatting up the wife.  No use to worry about what I might have done better in the past or what might be in my future.  I cant do one damn thing about either one today.,EssentialTremor,ddhymzi,2,t5_2v0b0
