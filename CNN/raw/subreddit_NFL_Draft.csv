448761,0,t3_1z7jvg,The ers play like the Oklahoma drill. Everything is one on one on the field. Our defense barley subs so we need players that can go three downs. We pretty much stick to base defense throughout the game rushing . The oline is straight up power run and all the lineman are maulers. Two areas of need are the wr and cb.WR  The wrs that we need have to some of the best in the game because we ask them to do everything from blocking to running every route there is. A prospect like Cooks is out of the question because he was put into motion most of the time in college to get a cleaner release. The niners wont do that come gametime. The  draft was so bad because they tried to get playmakers who didnt fit the scheme. AJ Jenkins and LaMichael James could have been very good if they went to say the Saints who go  wide all the time and rotate a lot. They drafted for speed but at the end of the day they realized how much more the scheme matters to them and dont see them making the same error twice.CB  All of our cornerbacks need to be good in run d. Our th cb would play like most teams nickle cb. Even though we had worse stats I feel like our backfield played better this year than last. When Aldon Smith went to rehab the pass rush suffered leading to more opposing qb time in the pocket. Reid is so much better than Goldson that Whitner had his best statistical year to date. The reason why we need cb is because of the salary cap and having too many good players. Rodgers might get cut and Brown might not be resigned. With so many spread offenses right now you need more and more cbs. ,NFL_Draft,cfra1x8,6,t5_2t21g

546327,0,t1_cg27qmd,I look at it like are Big XII defenses generally considered worse than Big XII offenses because the offenses are so good or are the offenses considered good because the defenses are actually that bad? You seemed to be implying that the Air Raid offense is gimmicky and creates inflated statistics. I think it is important to consider that the Mountain West has full of these offenses that go out into other conferences and manage to put up pretty good numbers but the conferences defenses do well containing them. I think wed agree that Ohio State plays against a lot more conservative schemes and play calling than you get in the Mountain West. Against the offense that probably most closely resembles Fresno State Ohio State allowed Clemson to score  points on  total yards. Im not saying Fresno States offense is better than Ohio State or that the Mountain Wests defenses are better than Ohio State just that Ohio State knows how to best play defense against the teams they frequently play and the same can be said of Mountain West defenses and their ability to defend the Air Raid.

You obviously know your team better than a site that provides leaguewide coverage. And Jacksonvilles probably in a situation where they have to overpay a bit to win over some free agents something Walter football never takes into consideration. My issue is that Gerhart got essentially the same contract as Donald Brown Darren Sproles and Ben Tate. I dont think hes nearly on that level but who knows. It could work out. Its just a questionable looking deal at the time and by no means unable to be criticized. Now that Ive actually looked at his grades for your free agents I see he also criticized the Zane Beadles one which I think is much better than the Hood and Gerhart deals. But he gave the Jaguars an overall grade of C which seems a little low but representative of a free agency period that contained what he saw as some bad and some good.

The entire Dline did a good job on this play. Sack  vs UCF Runs the arc and does a really nice job with his body control to get around the edge. This a textbook t pass rush. Sack  vs South Carolina He cant get to a QB  yards deep much faster without a blown blocking assignment. Sack  vs South Carolina The LT Robinson got beat inside quickly and tried to pass him off to the LG Cann but Cann got blew up on the play also. Sack  vs Florida He is way more stiff running the arc compared to sack .  Sack  vs Florida some more st step explosion Sack  vs Florida Not a strong pass rush move at all but was able to read the QB and disengage from the LT quickly. Sack  vs Kentucky Better bend than the Florida sacks. Sack  vs Kentucky He anticipated the snap perfectly.  Goal line D Gets nice and low with leverage and has an initial win. However the entire Dline gets blown up. There wasnt really any pro run on tape against Ray also.  Spin move? never uses the spin move properly. He only uses the spin when he gets caught into a bad situation that happened a couple times on the games watched. Thinking turning around  will confuse the blocker? A lot of defenders do this when they have nowhere else to go. I just cant stand it because it never leads to anything ever. The LG does a really nice job on this play.

SThe Steelers lack of CBs is well documented and while they have a couple good  guys they dont have a true  CB who can hold their own against the top receivers in the NFL. Along the same line as CB the Steelers badly need an OLB who can get to the QB as Jason Worilds sucks and is likely leaving while Jarvis Jones got hurt and has not shown much of anything yet. These two needs go hand and hand and while I think OLB is a bigger need one isnt really more important than the other.After that theres a major drop off in terms of need although the Steelers do need some young talent at two other positions. Heath Miller is in the twilight of his career and the Steelers have nothing behind him. Theyve made great use of him in the past and another TE who can block and catch should be added at some point. They also need help at the Safety position as while they have a few guys there who will get another chanceget a shot Mike Mitchell Shamarko Thomas depth is needed.Beyond that the Steelers could use depth at a couple positions Dline  QB RB but none of those are big enough needs to merit spending a high draft pick to fill.,NFL_Draft,cntis9l,11,t5_2t21g

He is versatile can play guardtackle has good size   and comes from a school no one has ever heard of Hobart. The Senior Bowl raised some eyebrows for Marpet and while he faced subpar competition we could still see him go higher than the th round grade CBS Sports has given him.Hobart is a Division III school but they have just finished  straight undefeated regular seasons. You wont find much field on Marpet I Had to watch Hobart games to see his play but you can find some of his film from the senior bowl. He is strong and showed this week in the Senior Bowl practices that he can take on the Div  opponents and not back down.What I love? He is fundamentally sound. He has room on his build to grow and he gets his hips down gets low and extends into the opposing linemen. Perfect technique when attacking and driving. Should fit well in a zone blocking scheme given his size and if he show that he can take on the largerfaster talent of the NFL and D guys during the offseason.Negatives and drawbacks are obvious. D schools boast everyday guys like me and you as starters. Still he dominated everyone he faced and has looked good at the senior bowl. Keep an eye out for him. He likes to put people on their butts.

There are users that spends the time to explain the rational and reasoning between each pick. We dont mind these as its own post since it is much more of a catalyst for discussion.  Lastly there are the multiround mocks. These also take a decent amount of time. To do like a  or  round mock   you need to go back and forth and double check. The prospects after the st round arent discussed as much and can lead to good discussion. I seriously could of post a mock draft faster than writing this.

This can be said about all testing to some degree but bench is the worst nothing you do on the field really comes close to a bench press.I dont think it has a major impact but I think it definitely has an effect on their stock.

Youre making a claim so you have the burden of proof. If I have to coerce the proof out of you then your argument is weak.On his play I have never seen him stare down receivers. He looks off the safeties doesnt snap his head to one target progresses through his reads and can read a defense pre and post snap. Im not see the slow release either. Mallett makes his throws quickly and doesnt have a long windup when he throws. He also makes quick decisions and gets rid of the ball when under pressure. He actually had the fastest average snap to release time after his first game against the Browns. His less than stellar throw on the run ability also isnt much of a concern. What he does do well is stand in the pocket even when its collapsing and hell step up and deliver a throw. His arm strength is unquestionable. Its a laser. He has a very powerful arm.Also thats nice strawman you made. Were you drafted into the NFL? Were you a starting QB for a division  team? No? Then yes you couldnt win a Super Bowl. But Mallett was and so he definitely deserves to have his tape watched before you go around throwing out claims like he cant win a Super Bowl.Mallett also only had  year left on his contract with the Patriots. Tom Brady definitely didnt look like he was close to retiring so instead of signing a backup to a veteran contract they let him go and went with the Garappolo.Until you provided any proof your argument was completely personal opinion driven.

Ryan Fitzpatrick is probably going to start which isnt the worst but hes not a long term solution. Plus the Jets ARE a rebuilding project! Thats why they fired their coach and their GM last year and its why they were last in their division and its why theyre picking th!

Cooper may be seen as exclusively a slot guy by a lot of teams  a great slot guy but just a slot guy none the less  and White I see as exclusively a deep threat and perhaps complementary red zone target early in his career.Whites footwork on releases is dreadful the only routes he actually runs well are the go and the fade. His breaks are way too round and he doesnt shoulder ride to snap on cuts. I like how he double stems down field but again thats basically all he does well from a route running perspective.

Just draft Johnson as an RB and if he fails there which I see no reason as to why he would then itd make sense to give him a shot at WR before cutting him.,NFL_Draft,cqi0064,2,t5_2t21g
3736661,0,t1_cqgpu0a,he played Erving last year. Erving destroyed both Fowler and Beasley in  but Id say Fowler overall played better that year. That was when FSU had Stork at center which made everyone elses job easier. In  Beasley ate Cams lunch. but that was with a freshman at center who got beat every single play forcing the guards to commit to doing his job every down. Fowler had a good game against the true freshman LT Rod Johnson though Johnson beat him a fair amount too. but Johnson is a likely future top  draft pick so take that how you will,NFL_Draft,cqi7cpy,1,t5_2t21g

Thing think because a team needs say... a LB... theyre going to give that team the next best LB on the board to fill that hole.  However what they do not do is evaluate the schemes coaching tendencies GM tendencies etc.  They are fine enough talent evaluators... I mean no one is going to be right  of the time... in fact  of the time for talent evaluation is actually REALLY good.If you want a good draft for your specific team dont use a full round mock.

I think he just doesnt feel pressure well in general but thats just me. Speaking of looking left I noticed that he seems to have some serious issues when he throws that way. His hips open up way too much and he extends his left leg outward instead of forward when he throws and it seems to lead to him pushing the ball much further to the left then he intends to throw it.

It is interesting to see a guy outside of the top  on most draft lists so highly rated but I would suggest trying to find other games this season those may greatly change your mind as his TDINT ratio is  and if he were at a better school he would still be playing the same SEC opponents.Also of his  TDs if that number isnt bad enough  came in the games against LouisianaLafayette and Eastern Kentucky.

If you in this scenario draft a QB getting a safety blanket for your new QB is more important than drafting a RB early as there are limited TEs that have the potential to start for a NFL team in this years draft imo. Thoughts on drafting Lynch in the mid late first round btw? Ideally he gets  games to a year to sit and learn but he will be gone in the second round when the Texans draft. Cook would be available tho. ,NFL_Draft,cxelfyz,1,t5_2t21g

Myles Jack could fall due to his injury and Reggie Ragland has volatile stock and Id love either of those guys. Ragland might be the better fit for what the Packers want though.

And no  yards is NOT a feat.  yardsgame is quite easily able to be accomplished. The reason why there are less individuals rushing for more yardage can be attributed to the fact that many teams now use multiple backs. Feature backs are out there but with this being a passing league we see more two down backs and then another individual on passing downs creating less opportunities for individuals. Teams that run predominately with one RB are obviously more likely to have a guy hit closer to . Now if we were talking about LeGarrette Blount getting  yards thatd be a feat considering NE uses multiple backs.

6379711,0,t1_cze5fj9,This is written to both you and thekyleIm going to assume that the extent of both your QB knowledge is playing on Madden. I say that because the top down all perspective is what you apparently think every QB has all the time. Thats the only reason I can possibly fathom that either of you would think a QB should pick up on a rusher coming from his blindside at full speed with their head turned in the opposite direction. You both bring up the sack on that screen pass knowing full well that the LT the guy guarding his BLIND side wasnt just beat he was demolished. If we saw that in a  on  drill we would all laugh at that OT and tell him to take his shit back to whatever doorman job he has on the side. No QB is going to turn on their spidey senses and realize theyre about to be sacked less than  seconds in on a fucking screen pass thats just insane.Now talking about the chess match he had with the defense. You do realize theres a thing called a play clock yes? He made the right read initially he called his line audible and shifted his offense to a play that capitalized on that. Then the defense very quickly shifted into a new more conservative play call. Then guess what the game is over because you have to hike the ball. I promise you there isnt a QB in this years draft or last years draft that would have made that read then made another read and readjusted the offense again to a more preferable scheme in time to hike the ball. He makes his call then he has to do the best he can with it after they adjust this isnt a game where the MLB and QB can just keep recalling all day.Both of you talk about his supporting cast like its a side note. If you think that Cal with a full assortment of scholarships has less talent then Penn youre high. Their O line is absolutely better. Penn no shit has  scholarshipped lineman on that line and  converted DTs. That is something a high school team does not a team playing Georgia Temple Michigan State and Ohio State. A  man rush got through.  people. If that doesnt show you how bad that Oline is nothing will.I could sit here and rip on you two forever about your ridiculous statements and why your opinions make you look like you dont know football. I wont say theyre wrong because I cant objectively prove that. What I can say though is you sound silly saying his Oline is kinda bad or he should pick up on a blind side rusher in  seconds with his head turned for a screen.TLDR Hack isnt the greatest thing but you two should probably learn more about quarterbacking then what you picked up playing rookie Madden.Edit The word you looking for is elude. If Hack alluded to them we would watch him cryptically reference the possibility of them coming. Hard to elude rushers as they blast through your oline every play.

While I agree this draft is frustrating for us still incredibly impressive though I still completely disagree that DB isnt a need.  Its not as important as OLB DT or OG but its still an area of concern.Injury concerns abound for our CBs and theres no guarantee all three will come back and play at a CB level.  If the Saints think Alexander is a great CB I can see them jumping on him.  It would give them a young pairing at CB with good options for nickel and dime plus quality depth.As for safety the only healthy ones on the roster are Jairus Byrd Kenny Vaccaro and Jamarca Sanford and Sanford is an UFA.  Sunseri will probably be back but hes been banged up in each of his two seasons.  Rafael Bush is coming off an injury and also is an unrestricted free agent.  No guarantee hell be back.

6468935,0,t1_czoah8r,Sorry didnt mean for my last comment to sound condescending or anything.  Just generally curious. Dontae Johnson seems like a corner that Baalke would like.  Bigger dude with decent speed that can tackle well. He played pretty well his rookie year so I was expecting hed be a starting corner before the season started.  Obviously they liked Acker more but you would think a guy whos coming off a good rookie season wouldve had more playing time. I have a hard time believing Baalke has any allegiances to any of his players.  Every year he lets good players leave via free agency because he doesnt want to overpay.  Doesnt matter if its Baalkes guy or Nolans guy or Harbaughs guy.  Frank Gore was drafted by DonahueNolan and we didnt over pay to keep him.  Chris Culliver was drafted by Baalke and we didnt overpay to keep him.  Kap was supposedly Harbaughs guy and we might be cutting him soon.  I dont think Baalke cares who drafted whom.  Tomsula didnt draft any of those guys so I dont think he has any allegiances either.

6591889,0,t1_d0149mo,gt I dont know if its just me but he looks really slow when running.. like lumbering?I feel like a lot of his issues with appearing slow have to do with him having spotty snap anticipation and a lack of that wow explosiveness in his st step which results in him not getting a ton of opportunities to show off his closing speed which is actually pretty good. He also admittedly isnt great in coverage but he really hasnt had many opportunities to drop into coverage so the fact that he isnt completely awful is enough for me. His main job in a  is going to be rushing the passer and stopping the run the anyways so im not overly concerned about his cover skills.The thing I really like about Calhoun is he has shown steady improvement every year in college hes strong enough to hold up against the run and hes probably the most polished pass rusher outside of Joey Bosa in the draft. Lots of young edge rushers have that problem with getting stone walled when their initial pass rush fails and the guys that dont generally go top  so the Steelers are very unlikely to have a shot at one. The big plus with Calhoun is he knows how to use his length to his advantage and has that polish which gives him a really solid base to build on. He might never be an elite edge rusher but for a late st rounder itll be really tough to find a better edge rusher especially in this draft which has maybe three or four good  OLBs and a few sleepers. Im also not buying any of the Dlineman in this draft being good enough to justify not taking an edge rusher early other than Billings Robinson and Butler and I dont really buy Butler as a st rounder yet.,NFL_Draft,d015lry,2,t5_2t21g

6756912,0,t3_48aw1v,First round some trades fuck off Giants fans. Also I have a weak grasp of trade value. Ten.  J. Ramsey DBMy top player in the draft at a position of need. Trends were made to be broken. Cle.  J. Goff QBI still question the pro readiness of Wentz. Goff is the top guy in the class. SD  L. Tunsil OTI realize that OT is not a desperate need but BPA is BPA. Tunsil will be a superstar OT. Dal  J. Bosa DEOLBNo brainer here. Bosa is a tool you can build a front seven around. Jax  V. Hargreaves  DBSome people are down on VH. I am not one of them. Bal  M. Jack  LBNot looking forward to this twice a year. Jack is going to flourish on this team. SF  D. Buckner DLQB will be in play but if Kaep sticks around theyll go BPA. Mia  M. Alexander DBI think Alexander is slightly overrated but he fills a serious need in Miami. TRADE Det trades th overall and their nd rd pick for TBs th overall th and th rd picks. Det  R. Stanley OTDetroit gives up a bit to move up and snag a franchise left tackle. NYG  R. Ragland LBYou didnt like it when I gave you Elliot and said you wanted a linebacker. Youll get the best one still on my board. I think Ragland can be very good for a long time. Chi  A. Robinson DLIm constantly confused as to how to mock Robinson. The Bears can use some D Line help though.TRADE Hou trades their nd overall rd rd and  st for NOs th overall. Hou  Carson Wentz QBThe Texans need a QB desperately and will pay a heavy price to snag Wentz not wanting to risk developing one of the many risky prospects later on. The Texans are not in severe need at any other position so they take this chance on Wentz. Phi  L. Treadwell WRPhilly needs an outside threat badly and with their defense starting to seriously come together they get one. Oak  J. Conklin OTI might be overvaluing Conklin a tad but I like how he fits on the Raiders whose need at oline is a tad more pressing than people think. LA  T Decker OTHavenstein was impressive but the Rams still need oline help pretty badly. With no QBs or WRs worth taking they opt for the versatile Decker. TB from Det S. Lawson DLThe Bucs trade down and still manage to pick up the guy they might have targeted at . Life is good in Tampa. Atl  E. Ogbah DEThis pick seems like a great pick to me. Ogbah has been falling a bit lately but the dude is an elite talent in the making. Ind  E. Elliot RBNot crazy about the secondary prospects on the board Indy instead opts to add the best running back in the draft to their team in order to diversify their potent offense. Buf  D. Lee LBBuffalo doesnt have many desperate needs but the linebacking corps is a bit thin. This is a slight reach on my board but it fits. NYJ  N. Spence EDGEIm not as high on Spence as some but he could be a force on an already suffocating defense. If Elliot is on the board the Jets will take a very long look at him but he doesnt make it that far this time.TRADE GB trades their th overall th rd and  rd rd to Was for their st overall and  th rd. GB  R. Nkemdiche DEAn absolute steal and perfect fit. I think his character concerns are overblown but GB will be able to manage them. This guy will be a nightmare for offenses in the NFC North and my early pick for DROY.  from Hou NO  A. Billings DTNO needs help up front badly. And Billings is a major steal at this point Min  J. Doctson WRA strong combine moves Doctson into the first round easily. Cin  M. Thomas WRA luxury pick to a team with few needs Thomas could wreak havoc across from Green. Pit  J. Bullard DLPittsburgh needs a lot of help on defense but they arent crazy about secondary options at this point so they instead opt for a big man up front. Sea  V. Alexander OTOGThis is a steal in my opinion. The Seahawks have an absolutely desperate need for quality olinemen and they just got arguably the best interior guy in the draft. from GB Was  R. Kelly CRyan Kelly had a phenomenal combine and the Redskins supply Cousins with a potentially elite center. KC  Leonard Floyd EDGEI dont love this scheme fit but Floyd is defensive BPA at this point. I considered Coleman but I dont think Alex Smith is the type of QB he needs. NE  NA AZ  P. Lynch QBIve been set on this pick for a while. Im not convinced Lynch has an NFL arm but a team as stacked as the Cardinals can take the risk and groom him to take over for Palmer. Car  D. Henry RBIm not wild about this pick but Henry is a solid player who fills a need for a team with few of them. If Im a Panthers fan Im happy with it. Den  H. Henry TEId like to mock an olineman here but I think that Denver will instead give Brock another tool to use in the offense.There you go.

6758484,0,t1_d0id585,I tend not to put much stock into these types of reports but regardless most offensive linemen can be versatile and Conklin is capable of moving inside if necessary.

6792954,0,t3_48nno8,I think the WR dynamic in the draft this year is very strange.

Brown Benjamin Evans Cooks Moncrief Bryant Matthews Hurns Snead Cooper Lockett Diggs Parker Crowder Funchess etc.On top of that this draft class has been extraordinarily slow at WR   WRs clocked slower than Iowa Kicker Marshall Koehn. So the league is congested with young WR talent and the draft class is not as impressive physically as years prior. No doubt a few teams will get absolute steals at the position due to this but WR isnt as much a position of need as some other positions like offensive and defensive lines which happen to look fairly strong in  this years draft.,NFL_Draft,d0m9qwg,1,t5_2t21g

Doesnt make it worse just gives you a better read on the guy. ampnbspAs far as the accuracy I think having more throws helped him over Wentz as Wentzs limited passing opportunity might have hurt his stats. If you look at how Wentz played in  youll see stats similar to Goff this year in completion percentage TDINT ratio etc. I also dont know how Wharton gets his numbers. He has  more completions and  less incompletions listed for Goff than what Cal Fox ESPN etc. list. How did he get more completions than what are on tape? I could get it if he took out incompletions from throwing the ball out of bounds but you cant just get more completions? I just also see on tape Goff getting bailed out at times by his receivers and him also struggling more against better teams Utah Oregon.ampnbspampnbspA few things I have observed if you want to look statistically which isnt always the best method but... ampnbsp His completion percentage is being boosted by playing San Diego State Grambling State and Texas.

Not only that but they have  depth at safety right now. All of this is kind of moot though because Elway drafts for best player available most of the time.

I remember saying I thought he was more nfl ready than a lot of college qbs I could remember. Key words there A lot. Do I think hes the best in the last few years? No. Is he pretty darn good? Yep. I agree competition was lower but so were the skills of his receivers but he still made them better. His timing was great and once he adjusts to nfl speed his timing in he nfl will be great too. Hes very smart conflicting reports on his wonderlic v and is super hard working. Great character and nothing to worry about there.

Neiron Ball and Ben Heeney have shown potential but neither are good enough to feel totally confident at the position.  Malcom Smith is pretty much the definition of average not that thats a bad thing its better than weve had for many years.Dominique Alexander is an interesting pick because hes almost exactly Ben Heeneys size.  That could mean hes unnecessary or it could mean thats what our coaching staff is looking for. He has really good awareness gets downhill quickly and takes great angles to get to the ball carrier on runs.  He doesnt really have the sizespeed traits you want in covering tight ends but he can definitely handle zone coverage and some man coverage.  He has pretty good hips as well.  Hes not nearly as fast as Heeney but he is pretty good at compensating for his speed issues. I have a late ndMid rd round grade on him.  I think the th round would be great value for a well rounded ILB even if he doesnt have a super high ceiling.  I definitely agree that Xavien Howard would be a great pick as well.

The gist is that if a guy reaches a  he is a special special athlete.You add up the above statistics to get a measure of full body explosion that equates to a dynamic athlete by NFL standards. The idea is that prospects of any position shoudl be able to compensate in say BP for a DB by having higher verts and broads. Its strictly an athletic measure and has to be used in tandem with football skill.That last part is Beckhams weakness but weve seen crazier guys get drafted before.

7240547,0,t3_4eldy0,Hes got a great attitude about it and Im totally rooting for him but...From what Ive heard hes got damaged nerves in his knee which have resulted in a drop foot. For those who dont understand what that is it basically means that you cant lift and power off your foot the way you used to if you lift your leg up your toe drops down. It is a devastating injury and is generally from what I understand considered careerending. Thats the buzz we heard from the draft awhile back about teams realizing how bad the injury was  its not just torn ligaments its torn nerves and those just dont heal the same way. Also doesnt really affect things like squatting and weightlifting so while its great to see him doing that stuff its not really the kind of thing we need to see to see that hes on the path to recovery. Its really going to come down to whether he can run. And at this point in the process if the damage is as severe as Ive heard it rumored to be Im honestly not sure hes draftable anymore. It sounded like his knee was pretty much destroyed...Feel free to correct me if any of that is wrong Im typing this quickly as Ive got other things to do and so havent reresearched any of this but wanted to point out that if what I remember hearing is correct this is a pretty unique injury and is devastating because it basically means you cant push off of your foot to run. ,NFL_Draft,d2174al,5,t5_2t21g

Now for day Round  pick  Jordan Jenkins OLB GeorgiaWe needed another  OLB and Jenkins has good value here in the rd. We missed out on then elite rushers but Jenkins can get after the QB as well. Maybe not a big ceiling as a pass rusher but hes no slouch. He also sets the edge pretty well from the little Ive seen of him. Our defense is now officially stocked up with young talent at every level of the defense. Round  pick Pharoh Cooper WR South CarolinaFinally. We decided to wait to give Mariota another weapon so here it is. I like him as a slot WR next to DGB and Hunter. They can hopefully all develop together as they are all  or younger I believe. Mariota now has a plethora of weapons at WR RB and TE. Anyways Cooper was a big time playmaker in the SEC but I think it will take time for him to make a big impact. Thats ok if it does because there is  other WRs who are solidgood on the roster. Eventually I think he can be a dynamic slot WR for a long time.

7332688,0,t3_4ft3b7,Were officially seven days from Round  of the draft. With two major trades going down since my last mock draft there has been quite the shakeup in the top half of the first round.So its the perfect time to run through how I see the picks  playing out. As a reminder This is my prediction of what will happen not how Id make the picks if I were the GM for each team.Lets dive into my projections before another blockbuster deal throws everything into a tailspin.. Los Angeles RamsJared Goff QB CalAfter making the move from No.  all the way up to No.  it seems the worstkept secret in the world that L.A. is going to pick Goff. The Rams are an ideal landing spot for the Cal product. With a great defense and runfirst offense Goff wont be asked to carry the team from day one.Acquired in trade with Titans.. Philadelphia EaglesCarson Wentz QB North Dakota StateThe Eagles traded up from No.  to No.  with the goal of getting whichever quarterback Los Angeles passes on. All signs point to that being Wentz. Big strong and athletic hell face a steep learning curve coming from the FCS but he has a high ceiling if developed properly. Pairing him with QB guru Doug Pederson would be a great fit.Acquired in trade with Browns.. San Diego ChargersJalen Ramsey DB Florida StateProtecting Philip Rivers would seem like the bigger priority so Laremy Tunsil and Ronnie Stanley are distinct possibilities. But I keep hearing Ramsey. Is he a safety? Is he a corner? I dont really care. One of the best pure football players in this class Ramsey is a true differencemaker. The Chargers have a need at safety which he could fill while also contributing as a corner.. Dallas CowboysEzekiel Elliott RB Ohio StateIve heard three names all along with Dallas Elliott Ramsey and Joey Bosa. Itd be tough for the Cowboys to pass on Bosa my No.  overall player but Elliott is a perfect fit to play behind Dallas elite offensive line. He has the skill set to be an everydown RB from day one.. Jacksonville JaguarsJoey Bosa DE Ohio StateThis defense needs a lot of work and Bosa has the technique and tenacity to be a differencemaker in Gus Bradleys scheme. Hes a versatile  base DE who can kick inside and rush the passer in subpackage situations.. Baltimore RavensRonnie Stanley OT Notre DameSome teams are cooling a little bit on Laremy Tunsil. He could go as high as No.  but he also could slide a bit within the top . Can you rely on him after he missed time in each of his three college seasons because of injury and suspension? Stanley is the safer prospect in some eyes. His long arms  inches and athletic skill set bode well for his eventual development into an NFL left tackle.. San Francisco ersLaremy Tunsil OT MississippiIf San Diego passes on Tunsil at No.   which Im hearing is a distinct possibility  its not out of the question that he could slide this far down the board. The ers could try to trade back in this situation but Chip Kelly loves athletic offensive linemen and Tunsil is a twitchy pounder who excels in pass protection.. Cleveland BrownsDeForest Buckner DE OregonThis would be a perfect fit for the Browns. Buckner has some versatility but hes best suited to play  DE which just so happens to be one of Clevelands biggest needs. Buckner is disruptive against the run and plays with a great motor.Acquired in trade with Eagles.. Tampa Bay BuccaneersJack Conklin OT Michigan StateLook out for a trade at this spot. Tennessee could move up from No.  to get a tackle like Conklin to protect Marcus Mariota. Even if Tampa Bay slides down the draft board the Bucs could still get Vernon Hargreaves III more on him later.. New York GiantsDarron Lee OLB Ohio StateThe Giants spent big in the offseason to improve their front four and secondary but they still need to get a few more linebackers who can cover and get sidelinetosideline against the run. It would mark the first time since Carl Banks in  that the Giants drafted a linebacker in Round . Lee has been blessed with an elite combination of speed . yard dash and athleticism.. Chicago BearsLeonard Floyd OLB GeorgiaFloyd is one of the hottest players in the draft right now. Oakland would love him at No.  and the Giants could take him at No. . With uppertier athleticism for the position Floyd would give the Bears a highceiling passrusher off the edge.. New Orleans SaintsSheldon Rankins DT LouisvilleGetting stronger along the front four should be the Saints biggest priority in this draft. Enter Rankins who has very good quickness and lowerbody explosiveness. An exceptional run defender he flashed as a passrusher in his final two college seasons . sacks.. Miami DolphinsShaq Lawson DE ClemsonHargreaves could be another option here but I went with Lawson who led the FBS last season with . tackles for loss playing with a good mixture of relentlessness technique and discipline. He does his best work against the run and would be a perfect fit for Miamis  scheme.Acquired in trade with Eagles.. Oakland RaidersReggie Ragland ILB AlabamaThe Raiders need to get tougher up the middle of their defense. Other than having some limitations in coverage Ragland is a complete football player who has the size speed power and toughness to thrive as the middle linebacker in a .. Tennessee TitansVernon Hargreaves III CB FloridaIf stuck at No.  overall Hargreaves would certainly make sense for Tennessee filling a position of need with a good value selection. But as I mentioned earlier I think theres a chance Tennessee could make a deal with Tampa Bay at No.  to move back into the top . In which case Hargreaves  who has the best mantoman cover skills in this class  would provide an immediate boost to the Bucs secondary.. Detroit LionsAShawn Robinson DT AlabamaIm not as high on Robinson as others  ahem Mel  but he could go in the top  especially to a team such as Detroit which needs to start planning for the future at defensive tackle. Though Robinson has tremendous raw ability his motor runs a little too hot and cold for my liking.,NFL_Draft,d2bod00,30,t5_2t21g
7332937,0,t1_d2bp3sh,Based on the trade value chart flawed I know it is a very reasonable return to get.

Weve got a bunch of good players on the DL already theres no reason to double dip there this year. No pass rusher is a really bad idea. Even if we go into next season with the starters we currently have which would be a bad idea we dont have any depth at the position either. We have a total of four OLBs on the roster right now three of whom are at least  and in the final year of their contracts the fourth has never played a down in the NFL. Third round is way too early for us to take a RB. Gore is still good weve signed some good backups for him and next years draft is loaded with RB talent. I really want us to focus on the OL and defense this year then we can find a RB next year. I dont like Whitehair at .

7406032,0,t3_4gqiig,First time I have seen Antwione Williams in a big board excited to see him so high up. I hope that he does get drafted solid board.    So I guess do you think Hunter Henry will end up being a first rounder? Or does he end up slipping like a lot of mocks have him.    Your WR rankings are interesting to say the least.

7407306,0,t1_d2k5r9f,Exactly. But I think Grigson is too stubborn to draft a center that high. Thats one of his philosophies is too try and build OLine in the midlater rounds. As pure need Im hoping kellyand I think hes not too far off a top  player in this draft but honestly I cant see Grigs taking Kelly.

7408452,0,t1_d2kaeff,Well I definitely dont want him. And I meant that I wouldnt care if he turns into a Pro Bowl player because the other guys available at  will probably still be so much better than him.The main issues Chargers fans have with Stanley being the pick is that with literally every top nonQB available they reach for a dude that could probably be had with a lower pick.

However you act so holier than thou in all your opinions which is super super annoying. This is scouting which is an imperfect art and an imperfect science. So first you have this arrogant attitude about things while mocking other posters. Its aokay to disagree with an opinion but you mock people sometimes. THEN add on top of it you later changed your opinion on a player one that you previously took a holier than thou approach with and wont admit it. It is completely unbelievably annoying.What makes it more frustrating is youre so smart! You bring a ton to the discussion. Thats why I asked if you have aspergers. I have a friend who has aspergers and you two are so similar its scary. Im not making fun AT ALL but you fit the bill.My point? Taking the arrogant path makes other people annoyed.PS going from  OLB to cant get behind him at OLB isnt a minor change in opinion,NFL_Draft,d2mloqr,2,t5_2t21g

7446808,0,t1_d2on0xu,I question both trades losing an extra pick when they have many needs to go up and get a third safety. The second trade loses a pick next year to go up and get an extremely raw product. Both times they ignore what I though was the biggest need at guard and to a lesser extent defensive end. I can respect the Lasco pick since its just the th round but its still a RB. No idea where he fits on the team. Sure landing Turner and Allen after the draft is neat but they had no way of knowing that would happen while they were making their decisions. Also while I had him rated highly there probably is a reason that he went undrafted. ,NFL_Draft,d2onl25,1,t5_2t21g

7536609,0,t1_d2yg7eh,gt Id be interested in knowing how accurate you can get a formula?Well if I use the CBJ filter I posted a couple weeks ago for  DEs I can get that formulas R up to .. Thats pretty fucking spectacular if I do say so myself.gtObviously players will sneak in and get the right combine numbers others might have been injured but still performed at the combine.Its funny because Margus Hunt was an issue but as soon as I implemented age into my formula he went away. He was a  year old rookie which goes a long way to explain why he hasnt done jack shit yet. Aldon Smith presents a bit of an issue since he was coming off a broken leg when he tested at the combine. For what its worth though he still passes my CBJ filter. I just imagine what his numbers wouldve been like if he wasnt still coming off that leg injury...damn.gtI can see why WR and RB can be difficult an offensive line will mostly dictate how great a running back can be. And WRs can be held back by poor QB play. On the flip side from measurables there are so many athletes that can sneak through any formula.Dont get me wrong that stuff has a lot to do with it but my biggest issue with RBs and WRs is that there are so many shapes and sizes of them that succeed. I dont think theres a formula on the planet that can predict OBJ succeeding as well as Dez Bryant succeeding. Just completely different archetypes of players and a formula will naturally kind of trend towards one type of player. Same with RB you cant make a formula thatll get LeVeon Bell and Jamaal Charles right. you know?gtInterested to know how QB work would hold up to this testing. Its usually not a position Im interested in when it comes to scouting but it seems difficult to test?simply put Im not even going to bother with QBs because everything about that position is so much more mental than physical. The best QBs arent necessarily athletes.gtIs their a way to introduce rookie contract tackles for a loss?I mean Im sure there is but Im probably just going to use PFRs AV to quantify positions that arent as concerned with getting sacked. Im already using AV for these edge players Im just also using sacks.gtAny players youve come across where their measurables suggest a position change might be of huge benefit? Dion Jordan would be a good example to look at as no one knows where his best position is? when he is actually playing that isHonestly I havent gotten that far yet. Once I get my formulas set Ill combine the spreadsheets and have separate columns one for DE Formula and one for OLB Formula.

9574508,0,t1_d9sd7pq,Except I didnt say that at all but okay. I am actually one of the few Panthers fans that think we should draft a CB in the middle rounds but definitely not before we take EDGE players. I also think the idea that we dont have a guy who can be a good  CB on our team already is ridiculous and anyone who is saying that isnt actually watching Panthers games. You could put Darrelle Revis and Deion Sanders in our secondary and eventually they would give up receptions because we give QBs  seconds to sit in the pocket and read the field. The Panthers do still need a CB but it would be more of a nickel or depth option. Our  CB is Worley going forward and I am rather comfortable with that. ,NFL_Draft,d9t9550,2,t5_2t21g

9770416,0,t1_dagexsy,The FO starts and ends with Trent Baalke.  There is no way in the world he will draft a QB at  in this draft.  The only way he picks an offensive player is if that player somehow falls to the ers st pick and that player is INSANELY rated and we cant pass on him or get a trade done.  Which is not likely given how high we will probably draft.There is however a possibility that he gets fired and is replaced by the coaching staffs stooge possibly T. Gamble.  However even then the coaching staff would have to feel they need a longshot all or nothing move gamble on a QB to save their careers.  Which I dont think is necessary given their competence and given the patience shown by the Yorks.  Id give him a  chance of being fired before the draft.So first Baalke needs to be fired.Then second the coaching staff need to feel threatened into taking an insanely risky gamble in that picking an offensive player is going to save their careers in one season.  Which A is unlikely theyll feel threatened given ownership knows the list is a basket case and B its doubtful an offensive player shows up before the draft that is worth the risk.All up I think its very very unlikely we take a QB in the first round.  Maybe  or th if someone falls into our laps.edit while Im here ALL LBs are top priority.  WR picks are sexy we dont make those picks in the nd round.

9813469,0,t1_damojon,Re MS Yeah the th option is pricey. Players selected outside of the top  picks  the fifthyear salary is the average of the third through thhighest salaries at a players position. For players drafted in  that equates to  million at DE. I cant imagine it being lower for  players. Now if they picked up the option it doesnt become guaranteed until the beginning of the league year in March . However they would do that to allow them another year of team control. Next year his cap hit is . million which isnt bad but I dont really see them looking to extend him beyond that at a sizable number he just hasnt earned that and isnt worth the  million. I think there hope is he showed enough to net a trade not that it would net much but it would be better than cutting him for nothing.    I do agree about Barwin. I love the dude and Im sure the organization does too. Its just a matter of numbers and scheme. Sucks that he is likely the odd man out for it but it may be a necessary evil.    I definitely agree on the need. CBWR are equal needs in my eyes and wont complain if they go WR first or CB first as long as they get the best player. And I definitely agree about Curry. I still think hell turn it around it could be just a down year after the contract. But one good thing thats in our favor is the rookie wage scale. Since we are likely to pick in the mid or late first the cap hit for a DE wont be that large. For reference MSs was . million and Agholors was . million. Thatll likely rise but not all that much so the rookie will be cost controlled at whatever position.    I dont think theyll force the DE pick. I just think theyll have a couple they like with st round grades and if they are on the board they could pull the trigger. I wouldnt hate it just dont reach for a guy like MS.      Re WR Im not a big fan of Floyd personally and would avoid paying him. Thats just me. Ive never been an Aiken fan but Id imagine it would be a decent contract. Do you like him? If so why?

My by estimations he was easily a top ten overall talent but others disagree. I had to trade up to take him but it was worth.Round  Pick   Forrest Lamp OTOG Western Kentucky  Another really good pick if not the one I wanted. My original plan was to draft a center in Tyler Orlorksy but he was taken right before my pick but that didnt pan out. Lamp in addition to have a great name is someone whom I respect ucharliemann is really high and I think he makes a superb upgrade over Fusco as a Right Guard which will help open up rushing lanes. Round  Pick   Royce Freeman RB Oregon  A strong pick but again not the one I wanted. I originally wanted to draft Joe Mixon with Pick  but he was taken by Philly right before me. Freeman is still a talented RB and in any other draft class with a less stacked RBs hed easily be in the second round but I cant complain. Not a terrible draft class and BPA wise I firmly believe this is a good result but it wasnt my ideal either.,NFL_Draft,db901f4,3,t5_2t21g

10025715,0,t3_5j75j2,GB   Mike McGlinchey OT Notre DameI know McGlinchey has already stated he is going back to school but with Kizer announcing that hes going to enter the draft I think he might reconsider. There is no better year for a tackle to enter the draft as the weakness of the class will push him up drafts boards. Green Bay could use some extra toughness on the line and McGlinchey delivers.TEN   Jalen Tabor CB FloridaNot content to just add one playmaker to their back end the Titans grab a cornerback who is in the discussion for best in the draft. Pairing Tabor with Peppers immediately transforms the Titans biggest weakness into an exciting area of strength. Again they can grab their wideout in the later rounds.TB   Mike Williams ClemsonTampa Bay is ecstatic to see their top rated WR last all the way until pick . Mike Williams has a lot of Amari Cooper to his game and pairing a reliable shifty WR like that with the hulking Mike Evans will give defensive coordinators fits. If Jameis Winston is going to take a step forward he is going to need a playmaker like Williams.BAL   DeMarcus Walker DEDT Florida StateThe Ravens get back to what they do best taking great defensive talents with their first round draft picks. Walker is probably my favorite pass rusher in the draft after Myles Garrett though I think with his weird squatty frame and lack of length he might fall to the second half of the round.MIA   Takkarist McKinley DEOLB UCLAMcKinley isnt quite as devastating coming off the line as Walker but he isnt far behind. Hes a similar player though and will probably test better which makes me think they will go one right after another. The Dolphins need to find threedown playmakers who can bring some life back into their weak defense.WAS   Malik Hooker S Ohio StateI was tempted to give them Desmond King here because I just feel like they will end up with the Hawkeye defender but there is no way they let Hooker drop past them. He is just too good of a value here and safety is a dire need for the Redskins.KC   O.J. Howard TE AlabamaI know I know. They have Kelce. But think about this offense. Do you think with Alex Smith at QB that they really need a new WR? Maclin and Hill are fine there. But what if they could roll out twoTE sets like the Pats used to do with Kelce and Howard? Alex Smith would have a field day with weapons like that and this formerly vanilla offense would be totally new.NYG   Christian McCaffrey RB StanfordThis one feels too right. The Giants love their electric playmakers and McCaffery could be a perfect chess piece for this backfield. Whether lined up at tailback flexed out to the slot or even lined up out wide McCaffery is just the kind of elusive weapon McAdoo could put to use in rebuilding his floundering ground game.HOU   Patrick Mahomes QB Texas TechThankfully coach OBrien has shown that he is willing to do what is best for the team and bench his million QB. Whether or not Tom Savage is the answer we know that Osweiler is NOT the answer. I think one team is just going to fall in love with Mahomes and there is a good chance that it is a team like the Texans who have enough other pieces in place that they can afford to take this risk.DET   Zach Cunningham ILB VanderbiltDeAndre Levy is a good football player when healthy and the Lions D is proving to be pretty good this year. Still the Lions cannot pass on Cunningham who can be a solid and reliable presence on the D when Levy is healthy or injured.ATL   Quincy Wilson CB FloridaThe Falcons are in a great spot for this years draft having the luxury of their biggest team need align with the position of greatest depth. They can grab whoever falls to them and in this iteration it is Quincy Wilson. Many see him as the top corner in the draft so they happily add him to the mix.PIT   Adoree Jackson CB FSUAnother pick another exciting CB prospect. While he is a good corner Jackson is also a dynamic return man which should allow the Steelers to take Antonio Brown off special teams and ease any fears of having him injured there in the future.SEA   Cam Robinson OT AlabamaAs a Seahawks fan I admit I hate this pick. But this is not what I think they should do its what I think they will do. They need OT help in the worst way and while I do think they will pick up a new starter in free agency I dont think they can pass up the chance to get this mountain of a man in the first round and hope they can coach him up to being a good starter.OAK   Jamal Adams S LSUNow this is a scary proposition. Pairing Jamal Adams with Karl Joseph in the Raiders back end. While it might not be the Raiders biggest need they want to stay fast and hungry on defense and Adams is certainly that. Adams ballhawking skills combined with Joseph as the thumper makes one think of the Earl ThomasKam Chancellor connection in Seattle.DAL   Jarrad Davis LB FloridaThe Cowboys would have loved to have Mike Williams or Corey Davis fall here but instead of focusing on their  WR they get to add a solid linebacker to the middle of their defense. The goal of the Dallas defense should be to just slow down games and let their offense grind them away and taking a thumper at LBer should go a long way toward helping that along.NE   T.J. Watt OLB WisconsinYes there are plenty higherrated prospects at this point than Watt but he just feels like such a Patriot I could not help but slot him in here. He will not last until their second round pick and with the loss of Chandler Jones I think the Patriots have to take the talented player who fits in so perfectly with their team culture.,NFL_Draft,dbedms1,2,t5_2t21g

10126004,0,t3_5kxl51,Ill say this much Fournette is much better running gap scheme plays out of a two back set. He reads off a fullback better than he does reading gaps at the line with no lead blocker. I personally think its because it puts a lot less mental stress on the runner if he can just follow his lead blocker and make his only read be the leverage of the linebacker against the fullback rather than having to read the offensive line and read where all the fills are himself. It just takes a huge load off of Fournettes shoulders and he can play faster and more decisive as his trust of his fullbacks reads becomes more absolute. Adrian Peterson is the same way to be honest. Always has been always will be.Fournette is okay in zone but clearly reads northsouth style of runs gap power trap ISO etc better than eastwest style inside zone outside zone crack toss etc. Its just kind of what he was raised in so he has more comfort getting downhill immediately and letting instinct do the rest.,NFL_Draft,dbrfapr,20,t5_2t21g

10140096,0,t1_dbt0vvw,Attouchu wasnt injured at the beginning of the season and had already lost the starting job. His injury had nothing to do with it his lack of snaps.Maybe you are right about Landrum being used as another passrusher but Landrum wasnt someone who was getting a whole ton of snaps. That may have mostly been due to the fact that hes a UDFA but I believe that the scheme was in effect as well as having that many passrushers on the field is not optimal for most downs. I give plenty of credit to the coaches for being able to use players with various skillsets effectively in our scheme but we should be working more toward building our scheme around Bosa because if hes not the type of player to build your Defense around IDK who is.

10568019,0,t1_dd5zfg9,No denying that our TEs have been fairly underwhelming and bringing up Niklas is definitely an astute observation. He falls in to the argument Im making that hes a big bodied possession TE but he is also a bottom of round  pick not quite top  hes  overall. It remains to be seen how he will pan out or if he will forever be an often injured round  bust.gt Add to that playmakers like Tyrann Mathieu Tony Jefferson and DJ SwearingerI dont think that anyone can replace Peterson and it remains to be seen if we keep everyone on this list. The only guy for sure coming back is Mathieu. I think it is more likely we go DB than Howard and like you said adding to our secondary early is more of a luxury than a necessity. But another top tier talent CB would be nice to have after we seemingly came up empty on Brandon Williams and we have a number of other DBs being lost to FA.This years TE class is also really deep as well. There are two first round candidates available in Njoku and Howard. Plus a lot of talent later on in Leggett Butt Engram and Sprinkle.,NFL_Draft,dd6066d,2,t5_2t21g

That was especially evident in the SB amp Houston playoff game where they went after him specifically. The offensive line on balance was above average. Part of me wonders how much of that is Scarnecchia Pats OL coach though. If they made any high draft picks at OL Id say its more likely they take a tackle than a guard. You cant have an all pro at every position so Id be OK with them trying to develop Mason a little more. He just had a few very visible bad plays in the playoffs and they game planned to attack him.

That being said I think if we even could fetch a th the Browns would jump on it. He wont his NFL career has sailed away.                      B  We would have to be drowning in picks for me to be happy with the  Pick being moved. Multiple st and nds. Just look at what we got from Philly for the second pick it would have to blow that out of the water. But it also depends how far we drop in this situation. I highly doubt theres a trade offer out there Id be happy with.              Myles Garrett no matter what.                         C  Joe Haden. I love Joe Ive wore his jersey on  straight game days. That said if a team would be willing to to offer a top  pick Id be okay with parting ways with him. We are trying to get younger and Im not sure Joe will be playing at a high enough level by the time we need him to. Id love for the guy to retire here also so either top  pick or let him wear Brown and Orange his whole career.                    Truthfully I see Myles Garrett going number one to us Joe Haden rocking  in Cleveland next season and Josh Gordon getting high at home on Sundays. If you were to ask about the  pick or  then I see atleast one of those moving around. Either up into the top  for a QB or defensive player or  or  for Jimmy Garopollo.

10799349,0,t1_ddtq4rv,I dont think people realize how bad we are on defense. Not just from a lack of talent but also a lack of depth. We are going to have to pick and choose what areas to address and right now at least in my mind defense is a way higher priority than running back. Even with bad running back play in Lucks first two years we were able to win our receivers and Luck are fantastic. Our defense is however mediocre at times and more often than not just plain bad. My point is our offense should hold its own even if Gore regresses but our defense needs impact players. That is what we should be looking for with our first selection. I expect Ballard to take a RB at some point for depth and maybe add another OL for depth but  picks will probably be defensive and rightfully so. Ballard is the type of guy who believes in building a team from the inside out and I think he will select a pass rusher if the right guy is there. ,NFL_Draft,ddtvjcp,5,t5_2t21g

He was a lot like Cam Wake in that he came to the CFL to my BC Lions set the league on fire so when he went to Vikings I expected him to make an impact like Wake sadly no such luck which is fine because he is essentially the CFLs JJ Watt and became the st defensive player to win the MOP along with  MODPs and  CFL All Star teams. ,NFL_Draft,de06vht,7,t5_2t21g

11328991,0,t3_61oj35,First time Chargers GM here. Took an unorthodox approach to the draft to try some new things out I havent seen us do much of yet. samoansam was briefly in the war room with me but for the most part this was a solo venture.Round  Pick    O.J. Howard TE AlabamaTargets initially were Malik Hooker Jamal Adams and Solomon Thomas in that order and since this was a sub mock of course all  were gone. Theres been discussion in past war rooms about taking Howard and I decided to make this one the mock draft we pull the trigger. With those players gone and OL too much of a reach WR may be the next best position but IMO Howard is arguably a better receiver than either Mike Williams or Corey Davis. Explosive athletic ability soft hands that catch everything exceptional blocking overall a better prospect than even Hunter Henry. Yes we did just draft Henry in the nd last year but like I said before Howard may be a better weapon for us than any WR in this draft if we can run a  TE set with Henry and Howard. With Gates around for another year the TE core may be a bit crowded but it will be well worth it for the years to come especially with Henry and Howard able to refine their game with a future HOF TE. Gates is also likely to see less playing time this year.TRADE  Round  Pick    Jabrill Peppers S MichiganWith Obi Melifonwu off the board I wasnt too sure either Jabrill Peppers or Budda Baker would be available to us at  so I decided to be aggressive and traded up with the Falcons since there were some safetyneedy teams in front of us. We gave up our nd and rd for their st and rd essentially swapped rd rounders to secure a safety. Grades are all over the place for Peppers due to the criticism of him being positionless but on our team Id want him to mostly play as a high safety which may take some adjustments from him and sometimes play nickel if need be. Theres no denying his athletic measurables his size doesnt concern me his tackling ability speed and versatility to play multiple positions which we Chargers definitely covet though I would rather not ask him to play all over the place like Michigan did. I feel like his game is being over criticized much like how Joey Bosa was coming out people are just over thinking Peppers. Sure his production isnt where Id want it to be but given his ability and what hes capable of I think his ceiling is pretty damn high. His return skills are pretty good as well in case Travis Benjamin cant get it rolling again. In retrospect if I knew Baker would still be there in the real draft he DEFINITELY wont fall that far I wouldnt have made the trade but oh well!Round  Pick   Ryan Anderson EDGELB AlabamaGetting a pass rusher here wasnt my biggest priority but seeing that Ryan Anderson was still on the board he was too good to pass up and hes someone who could definitely wreak some havoc for us. Ill be honest and admit Im not sure where hed exactly play on our defense yet whether hed be SAM or what thats something Id just let Gus Bradley figure out to see how hed mix and match Ryan Anderson Melvin Ingram Denzel Perryman and Jatavis Brown but Im one of those guys that dont get too hung up on an exact fit and would rather just take fantastic players hence the Anderson pick.,NFL_Draft,dfg4euj,6,t5_2t21g

Also ive noticed that if he sees that someone else has made contact with the ball carrier he doesnt really look to assist in bringing down the ball carrier often times he would just stand there while another players try to bring them down.

All athletic pass catching guys.They use their tight ends much more traditionally which is why I think a guy like Rhett Ellison is much more valuable to their offense than an Njoku or Engram a la guys who cant blockI went McCaffrey because the Giants dline is solidified if they resign Hankins there wasnt value on the board for LB and theyre fine in the secondary outside of the safety spot opposite Collins which can be addressed in a later round.The Giants have no one to run the ball after releasing Jennings and all you Giants fans have a fucking hard on for Paul Perkins thinking hes going to be the next Tiki Barber when hes shown close to nothing only being used as the primary back out of necessity due to everyone else sucking ass.There are some picks in this mock I just fucked around and had fun with but I am laboring to think of who could possible be a better pick for the NYFG than CMC in this scenario.,NFL_Draft,dfv1xdm,1,t5_2t21g

Just looks like an NFL player.Hes very strong in stopping the run and its because of his hands and his ability to disengage from blocks. Hes done it against bigger and stronger TEs and tackles. I think hes legit here. His pass rush still needs some work. He gets his sacks off of effort and hard work which isnt a bad thing but his swim move is still inconsistent and I dont think Ive seen him do a spin move in the  games of film Ive watched. Hes dropped into coverage and hes shown good instincts when doing so. I think he can play  OLB because of this. His bend is inconsistent and I think its because he has tight hips. Im not sure if hell ever be a double digit sack guy.

No chance at finding a Pro Bowl DE when you draft one that limited athletically. As for Dawkins why? We just drafted tackles in the first and second rounds in  and we resigned Winston for depth. Even if Dawkins was going to play guard we already have both starters there and a young promising player in Christian Westerman. As for Zay Jones hes fine but hes not what we need in a WR at all. Hes another Lafell. We need someone who can actually stretch the field deep like Marvin Jones did for us.

But we have to at least have a roster spot for them and  tight ends is already too many.

11595533,0,t1_dg9zyst,I get both sides of it though I lean towards sorry cant do it. On one hand proper tackling is a teachable technique that can be picked up by players its not set in stone like height or arm length. Many guys show the willeffort on tape just lack the properdesired form. Perhaps they were improperly instructed on tackling technique years back and despite slight mentions of it from coaches since have never needed to clean it up like in order to keep their position have never done a complete rebuild of their form so they only kinda worked on it in the offseason like Mike Vick or RGIII learning to get downslide or AlfMo ratcheting up his ballhands drills. But on the other side of the coin how have you made it this far and not been able to tackle properly?

We desperately want to take pressure off of Cam Newton and there is no better running back to do just that then Leonard Fournette. Not to mention that stat you mentioned doesnt tell the whole story and lacks some context.Heres a video that had all of Leonards runs out of the shotgun formation. Some of the plays where he gets stood up behind the line of scrimmage you see his offensive line get completely obliterated  at the point of contact for most of those plays. Then there are other times where he is able to make something out of nothing. So he is not incapable of making plays out of the shotgun. Plus its not like we run shotgun ALL of the time.Just today our GM said that Fournette Fits what we do so I trust him more than people online saying he doesnt.

11690451,0,t3_66te0a,Link to day  mockDay Trade  for   and I had  players in mind when I traded up that I really wanted and I decided to move up to grab one of them. Round  pick   Howard Wilson CB Houston It came down to either Tabor or Wilson for me and because of Tabors horrid  and his character concerns I decided to go Wilson instead. Im a big fan of Wilson who is a excellent ballhawk and has impressive instincts. Additionally his size and burst will allow him to cover burners and ruin  catchers equally well. He can play outside will allow Ryan to move back to his natural position of slot and can be an excellent  CB for the Titans. Round  pick   Jordan Leggett TE Clemson Leggett was somehow still here and I jumped on the chance to grab him. Hes an athletic freak of a TE with great handsJust  drops in his last  years and can play anywhere on the line and was a huge part of helping Clemson take down Alabama last year. He does need to get better at blocking but that can be coached and I think he can be the franchise TE of the future.,NFL_Draft,dgl4pli,2,t5_2t21g

Miami plays a lot of nickel and drafting a linebacker at strongside would mean they wouldnt see a lot of snaps unless they also played in the nickel. Miamis defensive end rotation also includes a year old in Wake an average career player in Andre Branch and a primary runstuffer in William Hayes.

11790368,0,t1_dgweg1o,We had a great draft. McDowell could be one of the steals of the draft. PC and JS spent a lot of time with him and obviously trust him enough to take him first. Pocic will be an immediate starter. Griffin has all the measurables we like at CB and had a great combine. He sorts us out at CB and Gunner. Darboh is potentially going to take Kearses spot.
