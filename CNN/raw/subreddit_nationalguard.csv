Trying to fly is like a  year process and you have to be an officer and theres a shit ton of paperwork. Trying to travel is similar if you get stationed stateside then youre probably fucked for at least a few years till you can contract to be stationed overseas. You might get stationed overseas but its like a  chance especially dependant on your MOS. All that said you cant beat active pay benefits and professional development.

Yes after you are MOSqed you will have access to National Guard Tuition Assistance as well as any state specific benefits. However be aware that NGTA does NOT apply to anything after undergrad.

You can finish training and request a conditional release when you get back to your home unit that takes  months depends on your command. But honestly everyone has second thoughts the day before you ship its natural. You will spend your training on active duty status see how you like it and see if you want to do that for the next  years Active is not like OSUT obviously then go active Marines. Plus youll have to go to boot again for Marines just remembered that and nobody wants to do bootcamp twice.,nationalguard,dbwwxki,10,t5_2rffh

10284816,0,t3_5n6hkb,I was a regular smoker before joining.Your recruiter doesnt care. I told mine and he gave me a drug test before sending me to MEPs to make sure I passed. The military doesnt have some super strength UA tester. Stop smoking and in  months max youll be good to go. Also dont quit your job until you qre through with MEPs and have orders. ,nationalguard,dc9u9rf,2,t5_2rffh

10365026,0,t1_dcittzc,So the regulation that governs your process is NGR . All officer need a ch commissioning physical. Now what he maybe doing is using a dodmerb so he doesnt have to bring you to Meps. Once the dodmerb is complete sending it to the state medical command or down to MEPS to get it stamped off on? Ive just never seen it done this way but I guess more power to him if it works that way he doesnt have to leave his office. I  do basic branch I dont dabble in speciality branch much. Shitty he didnt go over your medical pre screen before you took it.  ,nationalguard,dcixrpf,1,t5_2rffh

11171703,0,t3_5z9iwb, great branch choices Officer world they are called branches and not MOS. As far as MP... personal opinion the military in general will teach you how to shoot move and communicate. The LE agency will teach you limited tactics applicable laws and how to do paperwork. I dont see a competitive advantage becoming an MP. And if you chose to go federal LE it is likely they will value Engineer and Army more than Aviation and MP. Depending on what youre going for they may value MI most since thats a very special niche. Ill share with you what a former FBI turned CIA agent told my unit years ago the agency will teach you how to be an agent. What were looking for is what skill you can bring to us that we dont already offer. Criminal justice degree and MP skills are actually counterproductive for them according to the agent as they will have to untrain you before they can train you.Good Luck!Alex   ,nationalguard,deyatrc,2,t5_2rffh

11796615,0,t3_68bhrl, Good question. Im an MP and a typical drill we dont actually do anything...sometimes we go to the range and do MP shit usually we just sit around and do nothing this is unit dependent. If you do basic this summer...when you come back you are in RSP until you go to AIT youd get BAH during BCTAIT but when you are home i.e RSP drilling you dont get it. As far as the GI bill you have to put in a certain amount of time to get the benefits so even when your done with AIT you wont get much maybe .  Not true. ESGR enforces this stuff and they do a good job. AT is a mixture of stuff. Depends on your MOS usually alot of training and not actually doing anything else again...unit dependent you will surely do some MOS stuff but you will also do alot of other stuff.,nationalguard,dgx6q3v,1,t5_2rffh
