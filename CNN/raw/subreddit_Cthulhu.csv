9945421,0,t3_5hx9qj,I havent read them myself but Ive heard good things about comic versions of Lovecraft stories from Mockman press The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath is kidfriendly with some spooky bits but no outright gore or horror. Its about an explorer in the Dream World searching for a lost city in a fantastical land with flying ships and armies of cats fighting on the moon. ,Cthulhu,db3wvug,3,t5_2qmzi

10294023,0,t1_dcamjg4,You are all acting like Cthulhu existed before this short story. Damn he is one of the most interesting monsters around and this is where he is first described! There is a reason you see Cthulu all over pop culture  years later.,Cthulhu,dcavtb9,5,t5_2qmzi
10487931,0,t3_5q6xwx,Just tell him to read the stories? There are only a few dozen. The whole collection is maybe  pages at the most. You can download most on audio book too and his stuff translates really well to spoken stories. Also just look up all the old s and s Lovecraft movies from beyond reanimator. Most horror from the s has that great surreal dreamlike quality to it nightmare on elmstreet hellraiser etc.,Cthulhu,dcwx090,2,t5_2qmzi

11382227,0,t1_dfm46hk,I like both approaches yes Derleth can be a bit anal and  obsessive with order but thats what I like in HPLs creation it can be used in many different ways and styles and still be relevant from sword amp sorcery to noir. Not all will be good of course but sifting through mud to find what works for you is a speculative fictionhorror rite of passage. Also in CoC RPGs if Cthulhu arrives HPs are usually meaningless its those pesky DnD people who keep ruining things.   ,Cthulhu,dfm5msd,1,t5_2qmzi
