10569058,0,t1_dd62u37,This was the idea I was thinking of just wanted to weigh in and get other opinions. I definitely like the idea of being able to carry the lens over to a full frame set up later so I think this is what Ill be doing. What are the main features Id be missing by using an adapted lens? Dual IS and continuous AF Id imagine.,GH5,dd645gu,2,t5_3db06

11478558,0,t3_63r65b,Yeah its somewhat unsettling but its  supposed to be that way  easier to just take the power off the IBIS and let it move around freely when the camera is not in use ,GH5,dfx3a3d,2,t5_3db06

11749733,0,t1_dgp6zfv,Ok just watched one of his videos  he was pissed Canon wouldnt fix a lens he broke. He even offered to pay to have it fixed. They wouldnt budge,GH5,dgrv12m,2,t5_3db06
11808686,0,t3_68g81x,I do a lot of low light filmingphotography so this is an important one for me. I have the Sigma   Speedbooster combo and can confirm that its great for low light. Also have the Voigtlnder f. .mm which I have mainly used for photography but is unbelievably good in low light. Keep in mind that these are both art lenses so with a wide open aperture your focus will be very limited.,GH5,dgyk0cn,1,t5_3db06
