10879482,0,t1_de1hbr4,Boy ... the games are about getting good units  and its a pain in the ass to play the game with only  stars ... After a while you can increase their rarity  but it will take very long  and that is way more time consuming... and I never said you should farm for a good account  I just think no one should complain about their respective account being weaker than others when they put a bit of time into rerolling. And its not hard to reroll for a  star  itll happen sooner or later ... If you dont change your attitude  you will complain forever.,FEHEROS,de25385,2,t5_3iwl4
