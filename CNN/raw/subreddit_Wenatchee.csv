5322580,0,t3_3nurfe,The rental market in Wenatchee sucks especially if you have any large pets.  Very low vacancy rate and the rental companies are largely against pets.  If its an option buying a house is much much easier in a lot of ways.,Wenatchee,cvs0sd9,3,t5_2sk6z
5924185,0,t1_cxvva6x,Fair enough. I was just venting. Im coming from an area that has laws that protect the tenant and landlord and are a lot more fair that what Im seeing here. But its all understandable. ,Wenatchee,cxw6x7b,1,t5_2sk6z
