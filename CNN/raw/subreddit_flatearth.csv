I have a lens that is fixed meaning it does not zoom at all. Its got  pieces of glass in it. My big  lens which I love for headshots has  pieces of glass  of which are known as Extralow Dispersion ED glass. They are in there for the express purpose of letting more light through. Heres the Amazon link to the lens which explains it even better and even has a cutaway of the lens that shows all of the elements inside.We actually use something called a TStop to measure how much light comes through a camera lens. The lower the TStop the T is for Transmission of light the more light makes it through to the sensor or film.So while atmospheric refraction has a much larger effect for sure the lens itself will distort and change things to some degree.

10495695,0,t1_dcxfeju,As a rational person I have no way of proving that religions are wrong. Well I can but their underlying theme is that gods in fact exist. I cannot disprove that. I cant prove it either for that sake. Because of that restraint I simply must admit that there is a possibility that there is a god or gods somewhere or sometime. I dont believe there to be such things but you never know.Now that you know my stance I think its safe to assume that if the Earth is indeed flat with a dome on top then something built it. It would not have occurred naturally. That being said if the Earth is round then that does not rule out the possibility that life here or the Universe for that sake still was created by an unknown entity or a god. So therefore your assumption that all religions are false based on the shape of the Earth is not valid if the Earth is round. I know why you said it  its because it bears a better argument when you claim that the Earth is flat.Lastly the Earth is round.

11270227,0,t1_df9c6v0,Of course theres no reputable source because you strongly believe the earth is indeed a globe so any visual evidencecommon sense or experiments dont apply because the scientists have already figured it out and we have pictures of earth and yada yada and theres no argument in your mind that it could be flat  and I honestly dont blame you.   But I will say its the sign of an intelligent mind to be able to entertain a thought without fully believing it.   Once again before I explain I will say that I dont consider myself a flat earther Im not closed minded  im not convinced  Im definitely not religious  I am a logical level headed intelligent person as I would believe you are as well.  this is what perspective is  and perspective is what makes up your horizon  which is not by the earth curving away from you  which in itself makes no sense logically because if you can see the earth curving away from you straight ahead north  and see things past the curve being obscured by said curve  than how in the hell could you not be able to perceive  the curve on the horizon going east and west  even if its a very gradual one?  You cant say that you can see a curve where it suits your theory and then you cant see one in the other direction that makes absolutely no sense  think about it.   This is the same as I was saying in the post above  you would be able to see the water curving east and west if you can see the ship going over the curve going north.   This is just a fact like you honestly cannot argue this and its one of the biggest reason that this flat earth theory even exists. Anyways  the horizon always ramps up to your eye level  and it creates the converging point where its at your eye level and you cannot see past it and things beyond the horizon appear to be below a curve.   There is also things such as refraction going on because as you can see on many many YouTube videos and theres no shitty science going on here its just fact theres nothing to believe or anything to wrap your head around just look at it where a ship appears to go over the horizon and zooming in brings them right back into view  even when theyre several miles away and according to globe earth math  should be  obscured by the curvature of the earth.   On top of this  if said objects  such as a skyscraper  are behind the curve of the earth  then they would appear to be leaning away from you  stuck to the curvature of the earth  once again  just a fact it isnt any pseudoscience it isnt a conspiracy  its fact.  The biggest surprise here is that they do not lean away from you and appear to be straight up in all their glory with only the bottom portion missing.   Strange huh? And it is a fact  if you were a fruit fly on a yoga ball and you flew up  inches above it  the horizon would be dropping away from you and you would need to look down to see it  why is this a hard concept to believe?  Like  this applies to every single other thing in your every day life but somehow when it comes to the round earth  nope completely normal to see a completely flat horizon at eye level at  feet in the sky  yet when NASA is at the ISS  feet above the earth  there is a dramatic curve of the earth in every single picture and video.   How in the fuck can we not see what they claim to see with only a change of k feet???  Is it a magical barrier that suddenly allows them to see a curve and at k feet its just not possible to see?  Once again  think about it.     And the reason they would be hiding the flat earth?  Like I said before  I have always identified as athiest and  confined to what science had to say  until I looked into this whole flat earth theory and saw that it had significant ground.   Hard to say for sure but a common theory and my best guess is that in a nutshell they are trying to hide god from being truth.   For the past  years   of them were spent knowing the earth was flat and believing in god  until scientism essentially another religion that believes in the big bang instead of god came about  years ago.   I feel that if the world were to believe that the government is not god and that there is an actual higher power and something to look forward to after death  modern life would crumble.   If this so called science were to go the other way and  prove that the earth is indeed a flat plane and we dont know how it got here or what this all is then wouldnt you think that everyone would be praying to god all day  living their lives for him  not working because its not what he intended  killing themselves to see him  making sacrifices because its what he would want just stating the obvious crazies which would occur.  The world would revert to ancient practices  people would be ignoring the government and police because only god can judge them and so on and so forth.   It would have profound effects to mankind in my opinion  and the world would change  possibly for the worst  or at least to the highest most powerful people in this world it would be for the worst.,flatearth,df9gp8j,1,t5_2v2qv

NASA is hiding this knowledge from us. The southern polar star is also CGI Ive been to the southern hemisphere myself and it looks pretty fake. In fact anything else that contradicts the flat earth model is CGI. ,flatearth,dgy9ah1,9,t5_2v2qv
