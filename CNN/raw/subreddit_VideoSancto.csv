7713376,0,t3_4kzb46,Holy Trinity Sunday Although the Holy Ghost has many symbolic representations such as fire or a dove water is the most important symbol of the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity. At the very beginning of creation the Holy Bible tells us that the Holy Ghost hovered over the waters of the earth blessing creation with His presence. Adam and Eve our first parents were created by God on the sixth day of creation and the spiritual waters of the Holy Ghost were within them. But this Living Water was lost through the Original Sin. The Donum Dei...the Gift of God...was lost. Having hovered over the waters of the earth...having overshadowed Adam and Eve imparting His many blessings...the Gift of God was largely taken back. Soon the earth became a spiritual desert. In a real way all of salvation history is about searching for those lost waters and a return of that spiritual rain that gives life. Without the Living Waters we die returning to the dust from which we came. But if the Gift of God returns He will renew the face of the earth. Who has this Gift? Who has the Living Waters to give us? It is Christ the Son of God and Son of Mary from Whose Sacred Side poured forth Blood and Water. Blood to pay the price for the return of the Gift and Water to demonstrate that the Holy Ghost once again hovers over the waters of the Baptismal Font renewing the face of the earth.
