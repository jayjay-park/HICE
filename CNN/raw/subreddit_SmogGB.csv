Its warm flavorful doesnt leak much if you vape it dry which isnt hard because its a small well and really shows with my  ohm twisted g build. It really sings. I got my cigreen marquis in from smog today too and I put in a dual g twisted build in there and its about the same at the Derringer but much larger.Side note are all of cigreens clones this good? I mean I know I saw some scratches internally on the Derringer and it needed to be cleaned but the marquis... That was flawless. Both feel pretty well put together and fit together with the o rings better than any tobeco or fast tech clone Ive tried not that I had any big issues with those either. If cigreens products are all about this good then Im definitely going cigreen from here on out... ,SmogGB,cop0gyx,1,t5_342f5

Ive noticed its very easy to be sitting around puffing on it and the button can rotate to locked without realizing.Edit Im hoping this was the problem with it not firing if it isnt then its most likely bad contact like was already stated.,SmogGB,cowuua3,1,t5_342f5

With that luck of his it probably wouldve been the best vertical nickel coil ever even if not the first..lol.With his job he is on the road a lot traveling across the country and a lot of placed that are in between. I think he is looking at it as laziness and not wanting to deal with coils on the road. Ive tried to tell him that it isnt as bad as he thinks prior to this too.He is on the fence. I can tell. If I can get him to grab a Subtank I think it might be all over for him where hed be able to run their coils and the build deck.Another issues is that he doesnt want to upgrade from his iStick with the fact his girlfriend and her father want the things he gets and that makes it difficult. Should have seen the fatherinlaw last Saturday after taking a pull off of my SigS using my Flask. I know he is going to end up harping on my friend. Luckily his girlfriend was like thats just way too big for me.I wonder if shed say that about a Sigelei w where I got him to enter a contest from a local BampM on Facebook for one.

However as a test I laid the Billow on its side with a small amount of juice in the tank didnt want to waste too much to see if it would leak while sitting horizontally and sure enough it was sitting in a puddle this morning. At this point Im confident that as long as I keep the tank vertical I wont experience any sort of leakage but if I seat the tank horizontally Im in for a wet pocket.

Be really careful wicking less is more because nickel is so soft its easy to fuck up the coil when pulling cotton through it.  I personally like  wrap  AWG.   Its barely over . and ramps a bit more slowly than  AWG which with temp conte its nice.   ,SmogGB,cpt9gpa,1,t5_342f5

3573844,0,t1_cpzb2gn,Be aware that youll have to be careful of your wattage for that water test you mention. At a certain wattage you could run into the leidenfrost effect which would cause a layer of steam to insulate the water from the coil allowing it to reach higher temperatures.Generally the easiest way to test your device is to build a coil and wick it dry then fire it. That will tell you what effect certain temperatures have on your wick and you can use that to determine the temp limit youre comfortable with.,SmogGB,cpzn9il,2,t5_342f5

4723597,0,t3_3fmekk,This is what I was talking about awhile ago. This is Smoks new brand I think it looks nice except for the case and it would certainly be cheap. I think I saw somewhere that Smok or Koopor has different color silicone sleeves available. I cant believe they made the silicone sleeves like that they should have made them in various colors but transparent enough to see the laser etchings through it. ,SmogGB,ctpy6er,2,t5_342f5

5888130,0,t3_3vvu7i,Lol this is a joke right?  All smog has to do is send an update that says ANYTHING and people will stop being worried about their money.  Dont you get upset when you waste money because thats what a lot of people will have done if we never hear from smog again.  ,SmogGB,cxrguh1,5,t5_342f5

5916392,0,t1_cxs5pu6,How do chargebacks affect anything? The product is never released until all payments have been satisfied. Smogs job was to hype it and wait till the needed amount popped up on his computer then smog would transfer the money to the product people. If he had chargebacks its not like he physically handled the money back and cried cause he lost a MOQ. Laws and restrictions protect both parties where its difficult to scam Paypal or corporations. you would have to make up a elaborate scheme and be well versed in accounting or banking. Remember Smog dont get paid from the product people till they get theirs first or Paypal can confirm the money is there. If I charge back no money leaves Smogs hands he never sees it. All electronic payments funds. It comes from you to Smog who awaits products wait till the deal he made with product people gets fulfilled. Onny china dose dumb things like  this. Makes them look stupid and is a common business practices. Think about it your money to the safe house Smogs place. then to the product people. No cash is drawn all electronically. If only Smog knew how to you would take s gift card instead of a paypal refund helps avoid those paypal lawyers. What planet is this again. Take my money and your wrong cause I know it all and have the last response. As big as internet land is to get lost in I know Earth is much much smaller and makes it easier to find people especially if your much use to face to face interactions. Some of you act like you know  when its clear you are acting like you knew it before hand. Thats why he picked you you arent confrontational like some of us.,SmogGB,cxv65cl,1,t5_342f5
