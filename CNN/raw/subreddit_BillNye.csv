Ive always seen kids who were sheltered from things when they were younger drugs alcohol sex etc. turn to those a lot more when they grow up because they havent taught themselves self control by that point. Its not a stretch to imagine itd be similar with sexuality. I dont think telling a straight kid gay people exist and that its fine to be gay or bi is gonna make him somehow be attracted to men. And also Im not suggesting you tell them about sex besides traditional Im referring strictly to attraction. Even if I was gay myself I wouldnt explain gay sex to my kid...Edit Im starting to get the feeling were on two sides of the same coin and theres just communication issues...
