11788030,0,t3_6872u5,A little freestyle I guess I didnt really make up a routine just tried to show off some of the moves Ive learned. I know those spins are nowhere near perfect and Im kinda all over the place. Towards the end there I kind of just try out some new moves and I know it looks dumb lol. Oh and Im working on flowing hand movements that help with balance and also my concentrating facial expressions  Any advice is much welcome  ,CuttingShapes,dgw7nyv,2,t5_38dm9
