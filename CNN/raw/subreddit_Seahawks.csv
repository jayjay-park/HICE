339,0,t1_ceegepx,Ah thanks! So Im guessing IR is an absolute last resort by the team when they know for sure the player doesnt have a chance? Otherwise would they just leave them on the roster hoping they would get well? And how important is the need to put a player on the IR? Is there ever really so much of a lack of depth that they need that one space on the roster? ,Seahawks,ceeh6zq,1,t5_2ryle

160124,0,t3_1vwaek,Ehhhh. Even as a Broncos fan I have to agree with your sentiments as the relate to Boulder. Ive traveled there twice in my life for extended periods of time and both trips I was astounded at the amount of rudeness at every turn restaurants gas stations stores tourist attractions. After the first trip I figured I just had a bad experience and that I was over reacting. I returned a year later and experienced the same feelings even with an intentional effort to have a better attitude while there. I wont be heading back.Im definitely not asking for you to do anything other than win big as thats what all fans do but I would humbly ask that you dont let the people of Boulder be a reflection of Bronco fans everywhere. Boulder is a unique breed.Good luck and good health to both teams in what could be the most exciting matchup in decades.,Seahawks,cewo6bq,2,t5_2ryle

164423,1,t3_1vyto5,I happen to be a die hard Seahawks fan and a very proud graduate of Texas AampM. First and foremost I am certainly not a hillbilly neither is my wife my sister my brother my brotherinlaw my uncle my cousins or any of my AampM friends. If you asked  people down here or anywhere in the south for that matter who the th man is  would say the Aggies. I consider myself VERY lucky to be a part of two th man organizations... Both fan bases are extremely proud of their football programs and the fan involvement and the excitement of the games is stellar. Believe it or not being an Aggie is actually what brought me to know and love the Seahawks. Yes it sucks that a lot of people at Texas AampM are caught up on the Seahawks using the th man trademark and any time anyone down here in Texas finds out I am a Seahawks fan they always bring it up which can get very annoying having to explain myself every time. But like I said I am very proud to be a part of both organizations. ,Seahawks,cex5s0s,3,t5_2ryle

If a football player wants to take a pay cut to stay amp win Im all for it but if he wants to leave and make money I support his decision as much. The Seahawks under Carroll more so than in the past might be and this is my opinion the best place to play football in the league. We have a very supportive amp emotionally invested fanbase.

216995,0,t1_cf2z6xu,using wikipedia I determined that we have played zone blocking teams like Denver before this season in Jacksonville Houston and Arizona. Jacksonville and Arizona implemented zone blocking schemes this year.Against Jacksonville we held Maurice JonesDrew to  yards and . yards per carry.Against Houston we allowed Arian Foster to get  yards on . yards per carry and Benjamin Tate  yards on . yards per carryAgainst Arizona we held Rashad Mendenhall to  yards on . yards per carry then he and Andre Ellington got  and  yards on . and . yards per carry respectively.on average we gave up . yards per carry and  rushing yards per game. from this it looks like the times we destroyed zone blocking schemes were against teams that hadnt had them very long whereas once they figured out how to use their schemes they worked against us. This leads me to think that you are probably correct and Denver will have some success against us on the ground.,Seahawks,cf35s5z,3,t5_2ryle

250136,1,t3_1wyr1f,If you think Denver could have rolled the ers then you dont understand football. Both Seattle and SF are built remarkably similar we have deficiencys yes but that didnt stop us from getting to  straight NFCC the  losses came in the final moments and against Seattle Sherman saved the season on the final play. that was game over until he made a great play. Against the Giants Kyle Williams muffed two punts while we carried a lead in the final minutes all we had to do was run the ball and drain the clock but Kyle Williams gave two free turnovers to the Giants and those directly led to the game winning FG.We lost the Super Bowl because of absolutely terrible play calling on st and goal with seconds left in the game a timeout left and a running game that worked well all game yet we throw  straight passes  of which were back to back identical plays. Seattle is not that much better than SF and to think that the ers defense would have been rolled by the Broncos is ridiculous nobody expected Seattle to do what they did just like nobody would think ers would do that either I guarantee if you play that super bowl  times you wouldnt get another result like that.Seattle just won the Super Bowl dont you have anything better to do than bashing the ers simply because people acknowledge that they are the only team that can actually compete with Seattle and are probably their only roadblock going into next season thinking about a repeat.,Seahawks,cf6oiq4,-2,t5_2ryle

You had their best tight end Jay Novacek a security blanket for Aikman retire that year in .  Barry Switzer was losing control of that team but it all happened within a  to  year period.  Still the only team to survive and make it year after year to the playoffs is the Patriots because one they got Tom Brady and two as much as you hate Bill Belichick he holds that team together with all the injuries the scrubs they get off the street.  If the Seahawks can hold their key positions together and do well against the ers and Cards they can be in the playoffs every year as long as they dont lose key players like Wilson or Lynch or Sherman or Thomas or even Cam.  ,Seahawks,cfapx98,3,t5_2ryle

291760,0,t1_cfaydvx,Also one thing to keep in mind is that there are rumors the cap is jumping about  million. I dont think that is being counted by anyone in their projections but its out there.I still think McDonald is too low on the totem pole to get a longer term deal especially if another team is willing to pay him. I dont know what the team thinks of Michael Brooks but they seemed to like him enough to initially trade for him and then keep him around on the PS. They may look to develop him.I think my point with Clemons is that all together he averaged ish million over  years and if you look at salaries for both DE and DT that  million to  million range is about where Bennett ranks. Anything above that and youre talking Ndamukong SuhGerald McCoyChris Long territory. Bennett is good but theyre better. I think theyll try and sign him to a  year deal that averages out around  million. Anything above that and I think they have to move on. I still dont believe there was any intention to keep Clemons this year unless he was still performing at his  sack rate. If Irvin gets better against the run he could go back to being LEO. They also kept Benson Mayowa around at that spot for a reason whatever that may be.You can keep both WRs with the savings from Rice as long as Tate doesnt go looking for  WR money. Still not sure if theres any urgency to take care of Baldwin if they can have him for  million or get a nd. Sort of a winwin there.Thomas and Sherman just depend on how the deals are structured. Both have one more year left so their existing salaries can be used. For example Thomas is getting around . million. If you pay him top Safety money its only an increase of  million again depending on how its structured. Id assume Schneider and Co. have been working on scenarios to keep them both.Basically I really only disagree with the amount of money youre projecting Bennett to get haha.,Seahawks,cfb07io,1,t5_2ryle

301544,0,t3_1xi0rx,No not after his rookie contract.  With one caveat  As long as he does not have a major leg injury possible or a Justin Bieber like melt down highly unlikely next season.Here is why at age  Sherman will still be in his prime and if this season was any indication he will still be the least targeted corner back in the league.  That allows the defense to focus away from his man and the free safety to leave him on an island as needed.  There are a handful of these types of players in the league at any given time and they are nearly impossible to replace at Shermans level thus their FA market value.Unless Pete and John work some more late round draft magic I expect the team to franchise or threaten to franchise Sherman at the end of the next year. Personally I would like to see the team lock him up for  to  years at the end of next season.  ,Seahawks,cfc0rle,3,t5_2ryle

341915,0,t1_cfg6d17,To be honest Ive been grappling with this issue for awhile now. The Seahawks fan in me wants to put Wilson as the undisputed  while the rational NFL fan in me wants to heed the opinions of the professional scouts experts and those that have cogently argued why Luck has seemingly struggled in parts of his game. Am I trying too hard to appear objective? Im not sure. The experts certainly do not have the greatest trackrecord and it would be fallacious and foolhardy to derive my opinion solely from theirs. Admittedly Im not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to scouting and assessing QB play I never really played too much football nor was I all that good at it I was more of a soccer player. Ive only been seriously watching the game since  before that I was a casual fan. That being said its hard to watch Andrew Luck in the NFL as well as his college career and not see a QB destined to be one of the best in the league. The same can also be said for Wilson.gtLuck is good and has the potential to be great but so far he has been inconsistentThis is true and one of Wilsons greatest characteristics is his consistency  both in how he plays and how he conducts himself as a leader on and off the field. However it would be unfair to ignore the challenges Luck has had to face from a talent standpoint. The Colts lost their HOF receiver two best RBs and loads of defensive personell they had one of the better defenses to start the season but after the Broncos game it regressed heavily. Luck was left with Hilton and DHB at receiver two exemplars of inconsistency a nonexistent running game and a depleted defense. A secondyear QB playing inconsistently under those circumstances isnt something that should be held too much against him. On a related note I think Russell deserves more credit for how he faired after losing Harvin and Rice.gtits unfair to say Luck is as good as or better than Wilson just because he passes the eye test as someone who could be great in the future.Deep down I agree but can we truly be objective in judging QB play when trying to consider some notion of fairness in our rankings? Being fair would have put the  Chiefs as the best team in the league this season but anybody with a modicum of football knowledge knew that KC had benefited from a weak schedule that completely inflated their winloss record. Potentials and hypotheticals are a necessity if we are to accurately rank teams and players. Im still not sure whether I truly believe if Luck is on the same level as Wilson. Ranking the young QBs itsa. Wilsonb. Luckbut Id also easily move Luck down to . Either way its really close and I cannot fault someone for thinking Luck is slightly better than Wilson.

371557,0,t3_1ycj4i,We love Wilson. Anyone who watches him regularly knows he is special. The idea that he is a game manager is so offensive to us because he isnt. He is a playmaker. He does some dynamic incredible things and is capable of whatever we need. Protect the ball throw a small number of passes and keep the lead? Got it. Chuck it for over  yards to give us a chance against the falcons in the playoffs? Got it. He can and does do it all when asked. We just have a conservative playstyle focused on winning the turnover battle.Im not trying to shit on Luck here  he is a great quarterback and will have an amazing career. But the prevailing narrative is that the only thing that changed from the colts losing year to making the playoffs was Luck which is absurd and honestly annoying. It surely had nothing to do with the new coach and new gm both of whom earned top honors for the year in their respective positions or the array of other roster changes. Nope just Luck he did it all himself.Wilson doesnt get as much credit as he deserves and Luck gets more than he does but it doesnt matter we appreciate him for what he is to our team and city even if others dont.,Seahawks,cfj9znr,58,t5_2ryle

Sherm has whoever is lining up on the right where most teams play their  because its not an across the body throw Maxwell has whoever is on the left. Kam usually comes down into the box to help against the run and defend the slot and Earl plays centerfield deciding which side he needs to shade to keep the play in front of him.

Also  is a huge year for WRs in the draft. So a oneyear proveit deal might be exactly what he needs to hit a better market without the mar of that weird gangmember hit piece that was conveniently published just a halfhour before the Eagles released him. We have the cap space in Seattle to give him  million or so. The question for DJax will be whether that sum being on a successful team and  catchesgame positions him better for the big bucks in  than would say catching much shorter but more numerous throws with the Raiders. ,Seahawks,cgh1ykh,2,t5_2ryle

1359689,0,t1_cimq5xk,Tier   Philip Rivers San Diego Chargers . average ratingQuite a few analysts said they would ideally put Rivers and Roethlisberger in the . range  better than the typical Tier  player but not as dynamic as the Tier  QBs. Eighteen of the  voters placed Rivers in the second tier. The same was true for Roethlisberger.Rivers cant run but he can throw and hes smart a defensive coordinator said. He is definitely a two to me  a real good quarterback.Another defensive coordinator put Rivers in his first tier with Brees Brady Rodgers and Peyton Manning. He also described what separated the toptier QBs from the rest in his mind. A one to me is a guy that  he is going to get  on you every game and you kind of know it that coordinator said. Hes a guy you are going to have to manage youre going to have to try to disguise and do different things against because he has seen everything. Those guys see everything. The twos are guys you can get. Like Eli you can get him on some things and can disguise some things on him. But the twos still run their offense they have control of it. Ben Roethlisberger Pittsburgh Steelers . average ratingOne of the offensive coaches placed Rivers and Roethlisberger in the top tier. He noted that Rivers wins with his mind while Roethlisberger wins with his physical abilities. Several GMs said they thought Roethlisberger had declined into the second tier over the past couple seasons. If you were there in Pittsburgh you saw him run the nohuddle you saw the command you saw him run and make plays a coordinator said. Other people will not think as much of him. He is a very good quarterback able to get himself out of tough positions.Said one GM Ben plays bigboy football  and regardless of what you think he knows how to win the game.T. Matt Ryan Atlanta Falcons . average ratingI was surprised to see Ryan command zero Tier  votes and six Tier  votes. Nearly everyone said Ryan needed to prove himself in the playoffs. There was a feeling Ryan would never be able to carry his team the way the very best QBs have.Thats not a knock either. If you told me Im getting a guy who can win  games and get you to the championship game and lose Id take it in a heartbeat one former GM said.The other former GM said its become clear to him Ryan cannot carry a team. I think he has potential but I see a guy that is a little bit hesitant and cannot pull the trigger this former GM said. From afar it looks like the more Matt Ryan has on his plate the less productive he becomes.One evaluator noted that Ryan has benefited from outstanding receiving weapons Julio Jones can win jump balls Roddy White a former wrestler knows how to fight for position and the recently retired Tony Gonzalez was a master at using leverage to make life easier for quarterbacks.One of the pro personnel evaluators called Ryan a solid starter who will never be a topfive player at the position. Another put it this way Hes the most disappointing guy to me. He does not have a great line or run game but other guys overcome that and are better than Ryan has been. You can throw stats away at some point and its just a feel for the player.T. Tony Romo Dallas Cowboys . average ratingA few evaluators questioned whether Romo had the mindset to play at the highest level consistently. Its a familiar refrain in league circles a feeling that Romo is an undisciplined QB playing for an undisciplined organization with a poorly constructed roster.People want to knock him one GM responded but the guy has talent and is one of the top  starters in the league.Romo is  years old and coming off back surgery but he still could be in line for a monster season one evaluator said. But I absolutely believe they will not win big with him. As soon as he decides its a clutch moment his brain goes elsewhere. He loses focus and tries to create something.T. Russell Wilson Seattle Seahawks . average ratingEveryone likes Wilson. But not everyone loves him especially when it comes to projecting how a foot QB would fare without a dominant defense and running game on his side. Still Wilson came in ahead of Colin Kaepernick Cam Newton and Robert Griffin III three other young mobile QBs.I love Russell Wilson one GM said. I like him for the intangibles which Kaepernick has not displayed. I have Wilson as a three and think he might ascend to a two. I dont think he will ever be a one. Kaepernick has a chance to be a one but he also has a chance to be a three or a four.Evaluators across the board lauded Wilson for his decisionmaking both with the football and in avoiding big hits when scrambling.Still some said they wanted to see more from Wilson in terms of decisionmaking and downfield accuracy from within the pocket. He has a curlflat wide open and cannot see it so he spins out and rips it  yards downfield to make an amazing big play one evaluator said.A head coach said hed rather have Sam Bradford than Wilson purely from a talent standpoint.As noted previously the numbers from Wilson and Kaepernick from within the pocket are solid but that doesnt mean people in the league perceive them as effective pocket passers. One head coach said teams with good game plans have taken away escape routes and made Wilson struggle. Injuries at receiver and along the offensive line have not helped. I want them to win games from the pocket at some point one GM said of shorter QBs. That is what will separate Russell Wilson  besides a great D  from the Doug Fluties of the world. Eventually you made them beat you from the pocket and they could not do it. Maybe he ascends to the bottom of that one tier but I see him probably more top of the second.T. Eli Manning New York Giants . average ratingQuite a few voters paused and feigned anguish when asked to make sense of Manning following a brutal  season. Seventeen of them placed Manning in the second tier.He is really a two when you supply him with the right weapons a head coach said. He is a guy that has the ultimate trust in a big wide receiver.Some thought Manning would benefit from a scheme change this offseason but most of the voters placing him in the second tier sounded a little apprehensive. I see Eli having a hard time generating things on his own one GM said. I dont see a great decisionmaker. He has never struck me as a takecharge carrytheteam type of guy. That GM put Manning in the third tier. Another drew comparisons between Manning and the Kurt Warner who became gunshy at times later in his career.Eli can go from a championship quarterback to throwing five interceptions in one game an offensive coordinator said. Joe Flacco Baltimore Ravens . average ratingFlacco came in just ahead of Matthew Stafford thanks to a couple of Tier  votes from evaluators honoring the dominant form Flacco showed during the Ravens Super Bowl run.Flacco would be a guy that you probably either love him or hate him because hes a big guy probably not the most mobile guy and hes kind of got the droopy face kind of like the Jay Cutler face where it always looks like things are bad an offensive coordinator said.One defensive coordinator said he thought Flacco played with a grittiness that was appealing. Another saw shortcomings from a football standpoint. He has a big arm but he misses so many plays because he doesnt read defenses well this second defensive coordinator said. On film you see guys open but he doesnt throw it to the right guy. Matthew Stafford Detroit Lions . average ratingTheres a feeling among evaluators that Stafford more than any other QB outside the top five has the talent to ascend into the first tier. He is arguably the most intriguing starter in the league.Ive watched Stafford a lot and some of the decisionmaking is questionable a defensive coordinator said. But as a talent I would have drafted the kid No.  when he was coming out of Georgia.A head coach said its critical for Stafford to work on his mechanics the way Brady and Peyton Manning have done over the years.,Seahawks,cimq6lq,8,t5_2ryle

Personally i like the system of Give me your top  in every position...so you would write your top  QBs RBs TEs WRs Linebackers DEs etc. Then you add everyones result and see who ends up where. ,Seahawks,cinag1m,5,t5_2ryle

1469942,0,t1_cj0dah6,I hear you and I know youre certainly not alone but the for life part of it is just not something I could ever subscribe to because I dont see the institution or NCAA as being indefinitely responsible. It comes down to taking responsibility for your actions. Its a choice to play a brain mashing game. I think a school should be forced to cover scholarship athletes health care while theyre actively participating for the benefit of the school but its still the persons choice and beyond those active years is something the person needs to consider. Additionally I believe that full cost of attendance should be the amount of money we give to athletes though I still have a slight issue with that because athletes are already given a monthly stipend in addition to their education a room and bed to sleep in all the academic support you could ask for because the school wants to keep players eligible food and more. Im not on the NCAAs side though I could see why someone might say that. I think their organization is crooked and needs to be fixed but paying studentathletes is just not the way to solve the problem. Instead we really need to teach studentathletes money management skills. No matter how much you give a  year old there are going to be some of them that spend more than they should and come the end of the month theyre telling friends fans whoever via Twitter and other modes of communication that they cant even buy McDonalds for lunch. Put that in a meme next to Mark Emmert holding benajmins and now youve got everyone hating the NCAA but whos fault is it that the kid bought a sick new LeBron jersey and pair of Beats headphones? The university? No. The NCAA? I dont think so. Im not coldhearted. I just want these kids to learn about responsibility because thats a better quality than anything they could learn by being paid as amatuers. I think given the amount of money the NCAA makes though it would be fair for studentathletes to receive more full cost of attendance but not be paid.,Seahawks,cj0j6u7,1,t5_2ryle

1866342,0,t1_ckdy98d,Ya know I share some of your thinking as well in thinking that the Seahawks have the opportunity to go . A couple points Last year the Seahawks went . In each of those  losses they were within one score. With a healthy Percy Harvin getting that extra score would have been a LOT easier. Last year the Seahawks tied for the youngest team to ever win the Superbowl. The team they tied with? The  Miami Dolphins and as we all know the next year the  Dolphins went undefeated.Despite this to me the odds are against the Seahawks finishing . Theres too many potential factors that can throw a wrench into that plan with potential injuries the early bye week etc so Im not going to make that prediction. But to me its not unreasonable to think that the Seahawks have the best chance of a perfect season since the  Patriots and Im surprised it isnt talked about more.,Seahawks,cke3729,5,t5_2ryle

That provides a nice bookend for the narrative that William Cornell created from the very first video  that nobody believed in Pete and his vision in  and then at the end of the th season we saw how that turned out.Obviously Im no director or film producer but it just doesnt feel right to me to end anywhere else.

The thought that Wilson is on pace to be one of the greatest ever Im sure causes the writers in the American sporting world sleepless nights. Has anyone thought to ask that asshole mike freeman what exactly is black enough?! And who is to say he himself is not black enough? That idiots statement is inherently racist because it presumes that any African American who does not act in a certain manner is not a true African American!

2610590,0,t1_cmz5eg0,As a er fan i expect my perspective on Hawk fans and how they treat me is bound to be biased or selective. Im sure Hawk fans treat me differently than say they do Dolphin fans. So on that im sure we can agree my point of view is more an example of how they may treat er fans and not everyone.As for time to mature as defending champions its possible. Though like i said my bad experiences did start before the superbowl win. Though it was when they were at least leading the NFC west a few times.Id like to see more winning with grace from the Hawks. Last year i recall a few Hawk buddies of mine saying i should be rooting for them in the SB show NFC West loyalty. Ironic since they were def rooting for the Ravens when the Niners were there. At this point i could never see rooting for the Hawks in any capacity though i could easily see rooting for other historic rivals. The environment that has grown around the relationship between the Hawks and Niners is far too toxic. A lot would need to change and respectful behavior would have to be more common between the two teams and fan bases. Hopefully as you suggested time to adjust to the new successes we can get there Then again the er front office may choose to destroy my team this off season and the rivalry will just sorta fade away. Not really a rivalry if there is no competition lol,Seahawks,cmzcb0j,2,t5_2ryle

2659327,0,t3_2qe7g5,The NFC CG tugs at more heart strings to me than the Super Bowl. It was still like Wow.. but I always envisioned that you win a Super Bowl like the Ravens did the year before or like how we did in the NFC CG vs the ers. The Broncos in a way robbed me of that sort of feeling by getting beat so bad. Its not that I didnt enjoy the Super Bowl because the ass kicking was unreal in a way. But in hindsight fans enjoy that scared feeling. Is it really fun if you always know youre going to win no matter what? I dont know. Isnt winning fun because we know a lot about losing and dont want that? The ers game had that scary moment like Okay this might be coming to an end.. Its not over and I know we can pull it out but this is scary.. Warren Moon screamed like a girl during the The Tip. I think we all did. The Super Bowl was just one giant ass kicking with no fear moment.The NFC CG game was just magical. Not saying the Super Bowl wasnt because it was in its own way..

The Colts count on their offense for big plays and yards while the Hawks count on their defense in a similar way.

2827544,0,t3_2she86,I disagree with several of these points.I think if theyre able to work things out with Lynch theyre going to let him play out his contract. Im obviously pretty biased being a Seahawk fan and all but this offense doesnt function well without Lynch and hes shown little sign of slowing down this year actually had his best year in terms of total TDs and receiving yards. I dont know about trading Mebane Avril or Bennett. We dont have a good DT to replace Mebane and Avril amp Bennett both great a great deal of pressure plus they just got  year contracts. Seattle isnt really in a need for more draft picks at the moment considering all the compensatory picks we accrued from lost FA agents from last year. I think ultimately they want to keep this defense together. ,Seahawks,cnphjce,6,t5_2ryle

2860843,0,t3_2svkrh,Takeaways from this game Our defense is really really good. Like really good. Even when given short field position most of the first half and having their two top players playing injured most of the game they still held fast and made multiple stops even on the goal line.  Russell Wilson may have let a deficit get to his head for the first time ever but it was clear that he had dispelled those demons by the end of the game.  It seems like every time we have a player play a horrible game those players always make the big play at the end we need. Willson Wilson Kearse Can we keep Luke Willson on the sideline until the th quarter? He cant seem to catch a ball to save his life and then when the game is on the line he catches balls with  guys hanging off of him.  Were really missing Jordan Hill and Brandon Mebane. We have to be able to stop the run and get to the QB in the Super Bowl or it will be another heart attack game again.,Seahawks,cnta296,1,t5_2ryle

Im guessing thats because nobody is really jumping around nearly as much for that drive... but dang that Packers drive was the loudest Ive ever heard CLink.Also Im not entirely sure how much distance has an impact but I took Professor Vidales class at UW the seismologist who proclaimed the Beastquake in the first place  and he said that the instruments were on a nearby road somewhat close to the train station while these instruments were directly in the stadium according to the article.,Seahawks,cnvxssu,8,t5_2ryle

I apparently hate myself so I often look at facebook comments for NFL stuff and of course its the same old tired band wagon jokes over and over and over and all I can think was that the Patriots have one of the biggest band wagon fanbases from just the Brady era. Does that matter? no. Im ok with any fan who jumps on the bus. I dont care much for fair weather fans but it is what it is. I finally hit a breaking point where I realized they keep repeating the same bandwagon crap all year long because they have nothing else to say about the Hawks. There is nothing TO say. Domination is domination and no one wants to talk actual football. If someone came to me and said THIS is why the Hawks suck Id hear em out but they got nothing so they keep spewing the same crap. We all had our day where we picked a team every NFL fan has. Most go with their hometown team sure but not always. Nothing is wrong with that as long as you take that team and you make them your own. Stick with your choice and own it. I grew up in the pacific northwest but I havent lived there for  years now.

2965207,0,t3_2u3it3,I feel like it basically comes down to how crisp we are.  If we play our game and dont turn the ball over like we did against Green Bay I think we win comfortably by the end of it  not a blowout not a bad game  but comfortably.Russell Wilson is CRIMINALLY underrated.  The NFCCG was a bad example but hes so consistent and so efficient... and so damn good I would not trade him for another QB in this league.Last year going into the Super Bowl against Denver I felt like we had a huge advantage at QB over Manning.  Manning has always feasted on defenses that he can read adjust to and exploit. We just line up and dare you to outplay us.  Manning lacked mobility.  Brady lacks mobility.  Wilson is IMO the best QB in the league when it comes to running the ball.  It gives us a dimension that they simply do not have.When you compare that situation and our defenses I dont think its particularly close.  New England could win they are very good.  I just dont think they will.When you step back and look at how this team has continued to grow and improve as the year has gone on I think theres a gap that isnt being taken seriously.  Todays team would not lose to San Diego St. Louis or Kansas City.  It just took time to get it right this year.Works for me though.

2997771,0,t1_co8nbnl,Im not a Seahawks fan but he is already top  for me. . Rodgers  . Brady  . Brees  . Wilson  . Manning . Luck.  And I wouldnt argue if you switched spots with BreesWilson or ManningLuck. This is obviously an unpopular opinion but I stand by it. I havent seen much of him in the regular season but this post season he looked like a top QB. He can get away from pressure better than any other QB and can consistently place the deep ball right into the receivers hands even when theres little separation from the defender. Manning was missing much easier passes to an open Sanders against the Colts. Hes great at not turning the ball over. Even when he threw  against the Packers two were tipped up and one was a crazy catch by Dix. And even then he put that behind him and put together a fantastic finish. He has a below average line and receiving corps and still puts up good stats. Collinsworth even said during the game that he was watching the receivers and they were just not able to get any separation. If he had a true  receiver and a line that gave him more time hed be deadly. Im not sure how good he is at reading the defense and maybe thats his downfall but he definitely looked like top QB from what Ive seen. Instead downvoting my opinion maybe someone could offer me a counterpoint to what Ive said.,Seahawks,co8pt8h,-15,t5_2ryle

This entire season including the Super Bowl when Lynch got  carries weve lost twice. gtSo youre complaining your offensive coordinator is incompetent because his team is better in the second half?Nice try. Im complaining because he seems to be lost in the first half. I give him  and the rest of the staff  credits for the adjustments. That doesnt nullify the fact that hes not helping his team in the first half as much as he should.gtNot pseudostat its a leaguewide correlation for the entire season of .The way you dropped it in its a pseudo stat. Its averaged across the entire league which means its skewed towards passing because the NFL is heavily biased towards passing. It ignores the fact that the Seahawks have the best rushing game in football and they were opposing the team that was one of the worst in the NFL in that situation against the run.Keep trying. Week in and week out we hear about all the weapons that a given team has. The fact remains that Bevell had a combination of great weapons and aside from the first Green Bay game couldnt make them work together as a whole. Even after getting rid of Harvin he still has not shown the ability to consistently make the pass game complement the run which is the entire principle our offensive scheme is based on. Keep defending him and apologising for him. The fact remains that the goal is to get better.  Bevell has not every shown that he is. Every single game he comes out and demonstrates a lack of any strategy to control the game. His apologists liken it to playing chess probing for weakness. I call it poor play calling.Its called offense. That means YOU dictate the flow and make the defense react to you not the other way around. ,Seahawks,co99q3p,0,t5_2ryle
3003252,0,t3_2ukso3,Want me to give you some other stats that will rip your heart out? Here The Pats allowed opponents to score  of the time in power situations runs on rdth amp lt or wi  yds of goalline. Dead last in NFL.Marshawn Lynch was the best RB in the NFL this year per DVOA. Pats were th in stuff rate. SEA was second in the league in power situations getting stuffed just  of the time. Lynch converted So basically the Pats th in stuffing when the opponent runs power on them they score  of the time dead last in the NFL and we have the best RB in the NFL were second in the NFL in power situations....and PeteOCRuss read the Defense wrong though it was true goal line and that they had the advantage with their  WRs in the game. Problem is it wasnt true goal line they had  CBs in instead of slower Linebackers so our WRs didnt have any advantage in fact if Russ reads that he should check to run cause  CBs are not ideal on a Defense when trying to goal line rush defend. The reason you put Linerbackers out there is they are bigger bodies they run up to the goal line and stuff the gapslanes and try to hit the RB so he doesnt fall forward aka get in for a TD. Well who do you think has a better shot stopping Beastmode Revis small CB or a  Linebacker? ,Seahawks,co9a9tt,18,t5_2ryle

3152740,0,t1_coorngg,Yup add Norwood to that mix no guarantees but my hope is he takes over for Kearse and we let Kearse go next year. I think he can do what Kearse is asked to do but better more often reliably and has more skills than Kearse ability to fight for the ball in a  situation. Basically hes the th round pick version of Kearse UDFA. My hope is we see deep balls thrown to our new  WR whos  like VJax or whoever and then some deep balls thrown to Richardson DeSean Jackson like and some thrown to Norwood like Kearse has gotten in NFCCGs. Having so many deep ball threats is a great thing...having them also all be versatile and able to dominate in the short to intermediate passing game is great as well.

That gives him time to look for a positive play or throw it away. Relying on executing a standard pass play hadnt worked reliably in the Superbowl or during the season for that matter.

Your comment I replied to said that teams would be willing to give up multiple first rounders for Russell soa. he is worth multiple first rounders therefore a good quarterback and worth paying or b. teams would be willing to give up multiple first rounders for a guy that isnt all that good and somehow you know better than whichever GMs would be willing to make that trade and you deserve millions of dollars and a seat of power at just about any NFL team  or c. no team would be willing to give up multiple first rounders so trading him away wouldnt be worth our while to just take random stabs at QB without any sort of draft power. I think youve just got a hardon for knocking Wilson. Youre correct that hes generally not asked to do as most of the top level QBs when it comes to his arm. But his legs and his decision making make his job easier as much as Marshawn does. Teams have to game plan for his elusiveness and nearly magical ability to turn nothing into something and so must dedicate resources to stopping that as much as they want to stuff the Beast. I am curious what other good recent QB prospects you think would be a star on this team thought. Luck? For sure. Newton? Yeah probably. Kaepernick is questionable because he gets flustered under pressure something hed see just as much if not more of on this team.

3909004,0,t3_356jjc,Having seen the Ravens go through this scenario multiple times you need to pay Wilson. Not doing so will give you quarterbacks like Grbac and Boller and they will singlehandedly lose you games. Wilsons talents are uniquely suited for covering up some absolutely horrid play by the rest of your offense and you should not take that ability for granted. He is a very good quarterback held down by outside of Lynch a very bad supporting cast and I dont think any other quarterback would be successful if put into his position. Yes my has team has won without toptier quarterback play but that required one of the alltime great defenses that fell apart the following year when we lost our key offensive weapon. We also let our bad quarterback walk and replaced him with someone even worse. Flacco may not be consistent but he does possess the talent to perform up to that level which he had to do in . Ray Rice was considered one of the best runningbacks in football prior to playing behind that horrid offensive line in . We were insanely lucky to have a good running back this year after we had to release him and you cannot count on Justin Forsetts to grow on trees. Neither player was a negative during that Super Bowl run or even during the regular season in general. If we go by Pro Football References Approximate Value statistic for  they were tied for most worth on the team. Citing them as having expendable value is bogus. If you want to compare the Wilsonless and Lynchless Seahawks to a Ravens team look at what we fielded in  when we lost Steve McNair and Jamaal Lewis. That team still had an elite defense and all that managed to get them was  after going  the year before.The key to understanding modern cap analysis is that the quarterback is the only position that is nonexpandable. A prudent front office is able to make up for deficiencies at all other positions through good drafting and bargain signings in free agency. Quarterbacks are able to command their salaries not because the position is overvalued but because good players at their positions are in such short supply. Atlanta hasnt been struggling the last two years because they overpaid Matt Ryan theyve been doing so because they have been completely incapable of building a serviceable defense offensive line or running game. Obviously there are some players such as Sherman Wagner etc. that need to be retained but if you need to cut someone for the sake of money do so at a position that has less impact and is easier to replace. I do think Seattle has a good front office and do think they will work out a deal with Wilson whether they want to or not. However arguing that you are better off letting Wilson walk is completely insane. The defenses my team had in the early s were excellent but if I could have sacrificed some of that potency for a good QB I would have done so in a heartbeat. You do not want to actively put your team in that situation if you have the ability not to. I do enjoy watching the Seahawks play though probably less than most of you. Paying quarterbacks this much is just part of the modern game and the fact that this is even a question means youre in a good place. ,Seahawks,cr1v0ns,11,t5_2ryle
3910552,0,t3_356jjc,I think they are assuming RW cares more about his brand as the nice guy who isnt playing for the money. They know that Seattle has reached the Super Bowl two years in a row due to the efforts on both sides of the ball with help from lots of talents and plenty of luck too so theyre offering him something that says we really value you but were not going to be like the Ravens post Flaacos payday and sink all our money in one player.  They dont have to pay him this season and if push really comes to shove they franchise him for a few years after next at a moderate salary and spread the wealth to as much talent around the ball as possible. There is literally no way RW isnt a Seahawk for the next  years at least. I just hope RWs egoagent dont prevent him from taking a deal like the one theyre offering him and allow him to continue building his brand ie wealth outside of the game via sponsorship etc. ,Seahawks,cr21dt2,1,t5_2ryle

Im excited to see what he can do after an offseason with one of the if not the toughest defense in the NFL right now. .

We have a true top tier D with  allpro players Kam Earl Sherm and thats not counting probowl level talent in Wagner and Bennett.  We are not even close to the same thing as the Cards we have TRUE talent and a scheme that just works unlike their blitzing when Palmer goes down. Their blitzing worked with Palmer because he kept the D off the field enough but the backups didnt and so the D had to be out there on the field longer blitzing and that lead to them being burnt out later in the season. ,Seahawks,ctg4gbn,1,t5_2ryle

I think this is a very good pointgtHes taking too big of a personal risk by drawing negotiations out. I dont see the financial advantage for him to get RW to free agency  he wouldnt get getting paid significantly until three years from now. I dont see a clear motivation for him to draw it out. The time value of money applies to him too. Plus to what player could Rodgers ever promise the same deal Stick with me ride out your rookie contract and a few years of being franchised and Ill get you a few extra million bucks with a random franchise.

The things were now hearing about it just the rumors I dont think there is any way that we would have traded for Percy Harvin had we known hed be pulling himself out of the game and fighting everybody behind the scenes. I cant blame either Pete nor John for this. We didnt sign up for what we got and I guess thats football but its not gambling.The Percy Harvin Experience had a side effect losing Golden Tate.

Mainly because although I dig Turbin and think hes serviceable as a backup good speed decent hands and blocking he just hasnt done that much to warrant such a prestigious position as backing up Shawn. I dont want Beast Modes backup to be just serviceable. I do like Turbin and root like hell for him but I want more from that position. I want a legitimate threat. And its not too much to ask for in the modern NFL. RBs at least until this last draft are vastly undervalued compared to years past.Thats why the hype for Michael. Such a physical specimen. An absolute freak. But he doesnt have the required football IQ to take the next step at this level.This is an area where PCJS have underperformed. Hindsight is always  but we could have had Alfred Morris or Bryce Brown who were on the board when Turbin was selected. Or Knile Davis who was the next RB taken after Michael in . Its just bullshit second guessing but Im honestly disappointed with this area from our front office. I know theyre going for a certain archetype in RB fast and physical but it hasnt manifested yet. We have to consider Michael a bust at this point. Topped our draft class in  and is still at the skill level he had coming in. sigh,Seahawks,cuc796x,5,t5_2ryle

5009546,0,t3_3jjuo7,What you said basically.In my eyes its a big win for the players in the league not just Brady and the Patriots.It shows that Goodell cant just punish players willy nilly with no evidence and deal out arbitrary fines or suspensions.Im under the impression that the current disciplinary system in the league is completely made up on the spot by Roger Goodell. Hopefully this will lead to more predictability and more formulaic punishments no longer dependent on if the commish had his coffee in the morning.Im talking out of my ass and could be wrong about everything Ive said so far though. ,Seahawks,cupu8o6,20,t5_2ryle

They were missing a few secondary players by the th quarter and we still refused to attack them. Why not do some boot leg big play attempts when they were weak back there?

5230529,0,t1_cvgeiqa,While Palmer to Fitz is good if they played a defense that had a secondary andor line like New England Denver or Seattle theyd shut that down quick.I mean the way I see it they are gonna go  come off the bye go into Seattle and get steamrolled and lose  of the last .Those first  games are SO easy. But I dont think they will beat the Seahawks in either game I dont think theyll beat the Eagles or Packers. The Bengals and Vikings are still question marks I think those games are games the Cardinals CAN win but I also think those will be games they can easily lose. But in the first half the only game I could see them losing is the Steelers game.Im not delusional I dont think they are going to finish last or even miss the playoffs but... they havent impressed me.They seem to have a MAJOR Napoleon complex they dont even seem sure that they are a top team themselves. The reason they seem to score so many points isnt because their offense is so elite. It is legitimately them trying to pile on. To prove to themselves that they are elite. Try to do that against a top team their D will get pissed. Piss off a good D youre gonna have a bad time.I also dont think that D holds up they are ball hawking but they are also blitz happy and pick happy. Thats a disaster begging to happen. The defense sends the blitz the corner jumps the route and misses a  yard gain becomes a  yard touchdown. They can beat guys like Kaep and Cutler and they can beat Brees with the group of nobodies around him. But put Rodgers against them with Cobb and Jones they would pick them apart. Rodgers has a quick release to beat the blitz and is excellent a placing the ball in the perfect spot for his receiver to be the only guy who can make a play. Put Peyton Manning against them with that offensive line and Mannings skill at reading the defense. Manning will audible his way to  points and that defense will be able to shut Palmer down in a big way. And for a third kind of QB who can beat them Wilson with his scrambling ability the running back routes that Lynch can run in the passing game and Jimmy Graham fighting like hell for every ball near him As well as a good running game that makes them have to put safeties in the box. The Seahawks can make that D pay.And finally the offense. If they dont get a solid running game going then a solid defense does not have to fear the run. Palmer isnt Aaron Rodgers or Tom Brady a guy who can just beat the win with no run support. If they cant run the opposing secondary can relax and focus on the pass. Which also lets them double cover Fitzgerald. And one thing we know about Carson Palmer he likes the deep ball. This can pay off well See Chicago Game but it can cost you against a good secondary the LOB loves the deep balls and unless they get Rodgers levels of free plays Denver and the Hawks both have the secondaries to pick off Palmer  times a game.We have to see them play a great team but this is my breakdown of them against cupcakes. I dont see them as contenders yet.,Seahawks,cvggxd5,-11,t5_2ryle

Alsogt A defensive player may not contact an opponent above the shoulders with the palm of his hand except to ward him off on the line. This exception is permitted only if it is not a repeated act against the same opponent during any one contact.

5236908,0,t3_3mqjso,I was contemplating posting something similar wasnt sure how to approach it. This isnt so much specific to Rawls as a more big picture thought about the offense in general. Im kinda looking for a sanity check on this.As a preface we know Marshawn was not healthy yesterday. We know our offense line has a ways to go and yeah it was the Bears. However theres something that Ive been consistently seeing Marshawn is not getting to the holes quickly enough. Dont flame me yet this isnt about Marshawn.Someone else put up links to .gifs of all Rawls runs yesterday. Youll notice that on pretty much every play he was lined up in an I sometimes with a fullback sometimes as the lone setback. He made a few nice cuts but for the most part he was going northsouth hitting the hole and getting through it consistently.In the first half one of the few really solid runs Marshawn had was out of the I hitting the hole straight off tackle.Go back to week one. Fourth and one. Coleman and Lynch out of the I. Coleman hits the hole for three and a first down. One of the few short conversions weve made running the ball so far this year.Does anyone else see the pattern here?You can make the case that the Bears defense was worn down yesterday by the second half. I dont see it though. We hadnt had many sustained drives and they hadnt spent that much time on the field. We also didnt see Russell come out and immediately start picking the defense apart with passes so I dont think there were any glaring mismatches identified at half time.The big adjustment it seems to me is that with Marshawn hurt they had to go with a rookie running back so Bevell was forced to keep things simple. Thoughts? Am I reaching here?,Seahawks,cvh8k4e,8,t5_2ryle

5364411,0,t3_3ogqfp,Excellent post. I think your second point about the offense is a very underrated one. Despite being the head coach and supposedly setting the coaching philosophy of the team Pete Carroll always escapes the brunt of the criticism whenever something goes wrong. If anything this loss should be more on him than on Bevell or Cable.However your rhetorical question at the end of that point is the most important one that needs to be answered.gt In short why is it that the scheming is failing to utilize all of the accumulation of the experience and talent in Wilson and the receiving corps?The simple truth is that Pete Carrolls playbook has not evolved since . Back then our only true star on offense was Lynch. Wilson was still inexperienced while our receiving corp was an untested hodgepodge group of low draft picks and undrafted players. On other side of the ball the team had a lot of rising stars on defense mainly in the secondary. With the talent available at the time it made sense to scheme a clock grinding power running offense through Lynch and count on the high flying secondary to force a lot of turnovers. This as we know was a winning strategy. But we werent successful because we had the best play design in all of the NFL. We were successful because we had the best play design for the talent on our roster. However since  a lot of things have changed. Lynch is starting to show serious signs of decline while all the role players around him have slowly gotten better. Even though he is only a th year QB Wilson is very much a battle tested veteran. Kearse and Baldwin also share that experience. On top of that we have had an influx of new talent in Graham and Tyler Lockett. Despite these changes the coaching staff are still clinging to their three year old strategy. This became very clear in closing stages of Bengals game. With the game slipping away the coaches chose to put the game on Rawls back rather than turn to Wilson Graham or Lockett.Long story short The team especially the offense has outgrown Pete Carrolls three year old playbook. Wilson Lockett and Graham are being held back by a scheme that doesnt recognize their unique abilities. ,Seahawks,cvxd4d4,3,t5_2ryle

But the throw to Kearse a blind person could see he wasnt open and I think if we get a chance to look at the all  we could see there was an open receiver underneath  and I think the RB was open in the flat if there wasnt an RB in the back field that play it was a check down option there too.

With Rawls back there Bev feels no pressure at all to get the RB his touches because the RB is a noname K a year UDFA who is just happy to be in the NFL.

5944661,0,t1_cxyv158,gt If its so easy to pass efficiently on marginally lower pass volume why dont more teams do it?    The same reason teams dont complete one single pass at the start of the game and run the ball the rest of the way. Volume matters.    gtPasser rating is extremely well correlated with wins. Theyre passing up free wins!    This is a very ignorant statement. There are a multitude of reasons why correlation may exist without causation. If youre going to say stuff like this Im not going to talk to you.    gtI think most people agree that Wilson has for most of his career been saddled with an offensive line designed for run blocking and a passing game designed with simplistic route combinations and a receiving corps that didnt scare anyone. I dearly hope you were waiting until these issues were fixed to evaluate Wilson as a QB.     You will be dearly relieved to hear that I am. My conclusion to date regarding Wilson is that he can be effective in a run first team as a low volume passer. There isnt enough evidence to draw any other conclusion positive or negative about him.,Seahawks,cxyviei,-8,t5_2ryle

I dont really think officiating is getting worse as much as were just more able to instantly see everything from a million angles in HD. This is undoubtedly true. I also think the review system has an unintended side effect of creating unhappiness with bad calls.  The expectation of correction ultimately makes people more unhappy when things dont go their way.

6123154,0,t3_3zd9kv,I think itll be an ugly game.  I live in Minny so I read all the beat reporters and it looks like theyll be relatively healthy defensively next week.That being said Anthony Barr is their most dynamic LB and he hasnt really been himself since his injury right before the Hawks game.  Harrison Smith is back and hes a beast.  Hes the guy i worry about with Russ throwing bombs to BaldwinKearse because he is a ballhawk similar to Earl and he packs a punch.Linval Joseph is probably the most important player for this game because he is a monster inside.  If he is back and healthy and takes the running game out it could be a long day for the offense because Griffen and Robison especially can get after the QB.In the end though I think the Seahawks win a lowish scoring one .  I dont think the Vikes Oline can stop our pass rush and Bridgewater will make a couple big mistakes OR play exactly how we want him to and throw dink and dunk  yard plays and I really dont think Adrian Peterson is going to beat us.  Honestly this feels like a game where he tries to do too much and fumbles a couple times.  I dont see any Vike receivers burning the Hawks secondary.  I think the Vikes score a TD on their st or nd drive and then the Hawks completely throttle them when they open up the game plan.,Seahawks,cyln0e0,6,t5_2ryle

It was alright if it was a hype video but it doesnt hardly show any decent highlights. The problem with close ups is you cant see what he sees you have no idea where people are off screen so you cant see a defender that Beastmode is setting up to juke.

Part of the reason Wilsons pocket passing is so good is that the fear of his legs as expressed by Kuechly here means they have to mush rush and that buys Wilson extra protection. If you think slowing your pass rush to ensure Wilson doesnt hurt you with a broken play is the answer hes sorely mistaken.

6550694,0,t3_45cnmk,Offensive Line Russell Wilson is among the best QBs in the league under pressure but there isnt a QB in the history of the game that can operate at a championship level behind the current OLine. The Seahawks might try to replicate the Saints and Panthers and build insideout but with our two most reliable starters up for free agency they just need to nail down some kind of help for Wilson.Defensive Line Both starting DTs are looking for a new contract and the depth behind them is mostly unproven. Stopping the run is fundamental to Pete Carrolls philosophy and theyd like to stay among the best in the league in that regard but Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril would benefit massively from a real interior threat to the QB.Cornerback The Cary Williams experiment went about as bad as it could and Carrolls CB wizardry is getting stretched to its thinnest yet. Even if they manage to retain Jeremy Lane the Hawks are going to need somebody to step up and be the man across from Sherman.Theres  off the top of my head for you.

I hope Sherman Doug and Tyler play their entire careers as Hawks and retire Seahawks. I could see us moving on from MikeB at some point rolling with a younger amp cheaper Frank Clark but I hope he values the Seahawks as his home and where he won a SB. After a few seasons playing for the  he will sign a one day deal and retire a Seahawk.

What move is the DTDE going to use on you this snap? next snap? the snap after that? Bull rush? swim move? a stunt? The great thing about Glow is he is strong gtSTRENGTHS Loves to hit the weights. Generates power from his upper body and can get quick wins against weaker interior defenders. Coaches rave about his competitiveness and toughness. Has feet of a former tackle. Smooth skippull over the center. Clean pass set out to target and punches with flat feet. Instinctive and aware. Good radar when blocking in space. Consistent with hand placement in run and pass games. Former Tackle playing Guard. I love watching this game because it showcases Glowinski it showcases CMike and it showcases Chase Coffman. In this game against good competition Glow looks as good if not better than Sweezy and Sweezy has  games under his belt this is Glows first rookie playing time in the NFL. I really like how CMike runs in this game not only short yardage but the long rips. He just looks like exactly what we were hoping for when we drafted him. I really really hope we resign him. Chase Coffman shows up in this game in multiple ways. He goes  for  with a TD. Not just that but he blocks multiple times in this game run and pass pro and I feel like he does a really good job every time. I hope to see us resign Chase. If we can get him to really click in our offense and compete with Cooper in camp I think we could get a  lb big catch radius TE who can block well. He has an elite college career as a TE and if he can just get that to click in for us in the NFL he could be a great value. I like TE Jimmy TE Luke TE Chase.

6965833,0,t1_d15jwlc,I agree with everything but the last paragraph. DT in the first  rounds for us makes no sense. The DTs in the rd amp maybe even th round are most likely graded very closely with those late in the st and those in the nd. OL is deep and quite talented with quality guards and centers going in the rdth rounds. However after the first group of OTs goes in the st there is a really good group of OTs where we pick at th overall Ifedi Clark Coleman etc. We need to grab one to compete for RT with Webb with the loser moving  inside to LG. Go ask Webbs former teams how good he is they talk about him like we do Britt. The idea of him starting over anyone but Britt should be scary. From there I think it is best to grab the interior OLinemen we love most in R. McGovern maybe? Have him compete at Center and potentially beat Lewis for the starting job. Then...maybe...if the FO is smart and loves another guy...we grab another OLinemen in R where we have two picks. Yes we are a defensive team and we like playmakers but we cant put off OL it is clear the FO has had what is going on in the works for probably a long time. Knowing theyd let Sweez walk they drafted a RG in  R Okung walk etc. They havent really addressed those needs in FA...got to in the draft. Our critical unaddressed needs OL NT rd down RB Pass rusher. Besides those we should always grab a CB in every years draft. WR depends on what is in UDFA and how they feel about Kevin Kasen PRich etc. TE I am not sure about. Could use a linebacker another DT...but all this is after the th round IMO. ,Seahawks,d15wvgs,3,t5_2ryle

7355207,0,t3_4g08a2,There are two things that really irk me about this.In  the year Brett Favre was with the Jets they had to play road games at SD at SF at Oakland and at Seattle.  They went  in those games and missed the playoffs.  After the season was over Jets management complained to the NFL about having to travel so much.  So the league literally changed the rules and altered the scheduling slightly so that no East Coast team would ever have to travel all the way to the West Coast four times a year.  The net effect of this rule had it been in place prior to  is the Jets would have saved about eight total hours of airplane time over the entire season....but the league was willing to bend over backwards to accommodate the wishes of East Coast teams when it came to travel.The second thing is Ive seen days where Seattle will kick off at  AM in Carolina or Chicago and at  PM theres a kickoff for say Giants at Philadelphia two East Coast teams who normally kick off at  AM.  It would seem a very easy thing to simply dictate that West Coast teams in the East or Central Zone get  PM Eastern kickoffs...but the league simply refuses to do it.When I think of East Coast bias the difference between these situations leaps to mind.   The team based in NY complains to the league office also in NY about travel so the league makes changes immediately.  West coast teams have been at a proven disadvantage for decades but I guess we cant collectively whine loud enough to be heard  miles away.On the plus side no more  AM games in that barn in St. Louis.  Good riddance...and now the Rams will learn about what it means to fly East for early kickoffs.,Seahawks,d2e8j60,7,t5_2ryle

7567858,0,t1_d32fcsz,Fades require really precise timing and chemistry between QB and Receiver so I wasnt that surprised to not see any. The problem with when it mattered most is they were hurting the offense overall by forcing it to him throughout entire games. It is one thing to try to throw him a fade once in the red zone. It is another to create a game plan around getting him the ball and throwing him the ball  times when in reality your offense works much better when you dont do that. Im thinking hoping that in designing the offense this year they have really found that right amount of Jimmy to feature and when to just have him run a route and if Russ likes what he sees he can throw him the ball. With Nick Vannett blocking that frees up Jimmy amp Luke to be receiving TEs way more. So let Jimmy run his routes and if he is open or close to it Russ can toss it to him. In the red zone as you say is where Jimmy should pay his bills. It is why I am bummed he has been injured. When he got hurt I was bummed but what really really bummed me out was knowing hed miss all of the offseason work and camp and preseason work. That is when you catch  from your QB and build that timing chemistry especially for red zone stuff. ,Seahawks,d32ffyj,7,t5_2ryle

That is required for me to really like him. Yeah CMike always got a ton of hype and hed earn it for his preseason play but then in the regular season...yup disappointing until late  when he had matured and put it together. So yeah some stuff Pete amp others say is because they are talking to reports and fans and in fact the players players would hear about the coach talking about them negatively. I think they were always excited by the potential of CMike such a physicalathletic freak with wild potential. Call it what it is but I am on the Simon train but I dont think I am really biased for him. He did well in the reg  season it is now  and he is getting sweet comments from Pete about him. He is in his contract year he is a  year vet of the Seahawks defense he is finally healthy. I think it would be a shocker to see him ride the bench healthy having been beat by...

8148067,0,t3_4qu915,If you dont want to deal with seattlepi.com or a slideshowProduction mattersThrough his first four seasons Baldwin averaged  receptions for  yards and  touchdowns per year. Those are respectable numbers particularly given the limited options for receivers in Seattles runheavy offense but theyre nowhere near what you would expect for a top wideout in todays NFL.That all changed in  of course when Baldwins final eight games put him among the games elite players at his position. During the second half of the season Baldwin registered  catches on  targets for  yards and a whopping  touchdowns as the Seahawks gave opponents a hint of what their offense might look like without Marshawn Lynch.Schneider and Carroll undoubtedly wanted Baldwin back after his first extension expired but his breakout performance in  underscored just how important he might be to Seattles attack moving forward. His new deal reflects that.But so do intangiblesNo one is denying Baldwins impact on the field but just as important to the Seahawks organization is Baldwins presence in the locker room and on the sidelines. Not only is he one of the teams most vocal leaders  he is and isnt afraid to take on anyone he feels isnt pulling his weight including franchise quarterback Russell Wilson  but he represents something incredibly important to the organization.As a selfmade player undrafted and overlooked coming out of college Baldwin displayed the kind of work ethic and tenacity grit in Seahawks parlance that the franchise absolutely loves. His is a story the team wants to tell both as an object lesson for young players on the team and as an advertisement to other players who feel hard done by and ready to prove their doubters wrong.Keeping Baldwin around helps the team now with his play on the field and his leadership among his teammates but it could also help them down the line if his story attracts the next Doug Baldwin.The times the are achanginIn  Seattle let wide receiver Golden Tate walk in free agency. Part of the reason for letting Tate  a highly regarded former secondround pick who seemed on the edge of stardom  leave was the perceived cost of a new deal but the fiveyear  million he signed with the Detroit Lions now seems eminently affordable. More on salarycap developments in a bit.The other reason Tate was allowed to leave was the fact that given Seattles runfirst offense and focus on defense the franchise didnt pay premium rates in the passing game. That freed up more money for Lynch and for extensions for the teams young defensive stars.The Seahawks pay distribution is much different now with Wilson . million and three passcatchers  tight end Jimmy Graham  million Baldwin . million and fellow wide receiver Jermaine Kearse . million  among the teams top  players against the  cap. Seattle still ranks in the bottom third of the league in spending on receivers in  but the that spending is going up. Could that mean the offensive shift we saw signs of last year will continue moving forward?Rising tide lifts all boats As mentioned in the last slide its easy to compare Baldwins deal for reference  million over four years to Tates  million over five and conclude the team just didnt value Tate the way it did Baldwin. That might be the case but theres more at play here.Since  the NFL salary cap has risen by over  million or . percent after going up only . percent in the previous six seasons combined. That will likely continue  at least in the near future  with the current base cap of just over  million probably rising to over  million in .That means more space for teams trying to keep their own stars inhouse and more money for teams to try and lure away stars from other squads. It also means older contracts will look more and more obsolete just a year or so removed from their signing. Compare Wilsons fouryear extension worth just under  million he signed just last year with the fiveyear pact worth just under  million that Andrew Luck signed with Indianapolis this week.Still work to be doneBaldwins extension was by far the biggest piece of unfinished business for Schneider who can now turn his attention to securing players whom are undoubtedly valuable to the team  like kicker Steven Hauschka tight end Luke Willson and defensive tackle Jordan Hill  but none of whom are among the teams core contributors.Perhaps the most important unanswered question for Schneider and Carroll are their own contract situations. Both the GM and the head coach are entering the final years of their respective deals and while each has dismissed multiple question about plans moving forward their status has some Seahawks fans uneasy.Thats particularly true with rumblings from Green Bay  where Wisconsin native Schneider got his start in the NFL  that GM Ted Thompson may be nearing retirement. And there are some who might wonder if the fact that theres now an NFL franchise in Carrolls adopted hometown of Los Angeles might be a draw for the former USC boss.,Seahawks,d4w20av,16,t5_2ryle

Other offensive lineman for other teams may have a higher grade but theyre not being asked to do a job as difficult as what we ask of our o lineman. It takes a pretty specific kind of athlete to play o line in our system. Think about the difference in playing style between Russell Wilson and Peyton manning. I cant imagine Peyton manning would have much success in a college style zone read offense. Its much the same when comparing the blocking style of our running game compared to most NFL teams however the same grading system is being used to compare lineman between systems. What Im trying to say is that I dont think our o line is really that poor when it comes to talent.

8586859,0,t1_d6exs3q,gtI dont think we need to worry too much about any TE this season.Considering how badly we did against TEs last season I really dont think this is true. Teams have found the weakness in our brand of Cover  and this season we need to make an adjustment for it. Im not saying we cant do it just that we havent really done it yet. In fact this exposure in our defensive scheme is the very reason that I posted this question. We had trouble covering good TEs last year and now the Pats have one who is a likely HoFer if Im not speaking too soon and another who is pretty outstanding both with a very smart QB who excels at getting the ball to them. gtETIII and KJ completely shut down Jimmy Graham multiple gamesYeah in the  season.

People will say that the offense cant function with a line like ours but if Bevell was any good hed account for that and call mostly quick intermediate routes. Our WRs werent getting open against a below average Rams secondary because the routes Bevell designs are either too reliant on QB Protection or so simple that the DBs have no problems covering them. We have a future HoF talent at TE two pro bowl level recievers and a great pair of running backs all of whom were being used incorrectly.

8996843,0,t1_d7t1oos,Im going to go out on a limb and say Bevell out Bevelld himself.  Hes pretty transparent about his overall strategy.  Find a weakness use it for  or  plays then try to exploit something else while they try to cover that first exploit.  The epitome of that is pound the middle pound the middle make a surprise play like a shot down field or an outside hitch.  Of course that play actionboot leg but thats just a pound the middle with a surprise sometimes.  By the end of the game you should be getting both some good runs and be able to attack down the field as the defense doesnt know what youre doing.  With former Beast by the rd quarter hed be getting some good yardage down the middle on a few runs with break aways in the th.  And if you noticed Christine Fumblina Michaels was actually getting some good runs so there is something to be said about it even yesterday.But we couldnt convert first downs which doesnt really allow that strategy to coalesce.  Russell is hurt and doesnt have grease applied this season apparently so no play action to fall back on.  But did that stop Bevell?  No.  Hes probably thinking Everyone expects me to change because injuries weak Oline and no Beast...  I know I wont change!  Thatll catch them by surprise!With nothing working he didnt adapt fast enough or at all it looked like.  Well you could see we started to get a little desperate to find something that worked around the middle of the rd quarter which were mid to long attacks with speedy receivers.  And Graham a little up the middle just because hes such a large target and can get yardage.  But once we established him as a target we stopped moving onto something else because they were going to double Jimmy which leaves others open now!.And thats what is so frustrating with Bevell.  Rather than continue with something that is working he tries to change to exploit the perceived next weakness while using the middle running game as a base.  Hes fine giving up a down or two to keep that threat alive.  But if that threat isnt working and were not getting first downs it unravels his entire game plan and it showed in spades yesterday.  In the past typically Russell would take over and make magic happen but he just couldnt yesterday.  He relies so much on his mobility to make those plays that hes kind of lost and frankly seen the fear.,Seahawks,d7ta4pi,1,t5_2ryle

We recovered... but they reviewed and said it was no catch. They kicked a FG. i thought that at first. then watching the replay to me it looked like he was still bobbling a little bit as he turned and headed up field and barely got it under control by the time it was jarred loose. the only two plays referee wise that irked me in this one was the pass interference by sherman which was an obvious pushoff by marshall and the block in the back penalty after the pick on bennett. to me that block was on the shoulder to the side.,Seahawks,d8g2c6d,4,t5_2ryle

Mostly when Ifedi was out but also some misses by Glowinski. And Wilson generally does fine stepping up into a clean pocket if an edge rusher comes clean.  So the real question is can the Cards generate push inside. Who knows?  If it requires blitzing in the A gaps with mantoman then whoever has Graham is going to have to have a monster game.  I usually have a pretty good idea of how the games are going to go but with this one I feel like the game is sitting on a precipice and could easily slide down either side for a twoscoreplus win by either team.,Seahawks,d8yqbjj,5,t5_2ryle

9689310,0,t1_da712id,I dont think I need to go into the same old details that Ive listed again and again and that if you have an open mind youve seen alreadyif you didnt automatically lose objectivity as soon as you saw it was me saying his name. Those reasons should be pretty easily found with a search  including the reasons why its very questionable whether he instead of the players should get the credit for each of the points you mention.Instead stack all those reasons together and all the clues that hes only mediocre at best meaning that  like a broken clock the odds are hell get it right once in a while and instead Ill explain it very simply. I continue to bash him because ive loved this team for decades before he arrived I want the best for them and I believe that the success the team has had is not even close to the success they would have had with a truly good OC of the level that our offensive roster deserves.That said the biggest reason I continue is as ive said before everyone enjoys having a hobby and trying to get rid of the weakest link on the team is mine  hurts nobody and im not one to suffer in silence when i see a problem.. once upon a time a very american trait.Steering unrelated conversations? Or maybe just making a throwaway wisecrack that i didnt expect to do any steering beyond lightening things up with a temporary chuckle by poking fun at myself and my obsession? I can take a joke even when the joke is on my team whether the joke is refs so bad you have to laugh at them.. or someone getting paid to take Russ Jimmy and Doug thru games where not a single td is scored or someone who routinely needs half a game or half a season to rediscover the way to play some sort of offense.When someone takes a shot at PC or JS or Russ or Sherm or Bennett they get downvoted maybe a few people argue about it but not very seriously and life goes on. If Bevells so great why do some people get so defensive about him? I wont ask the obvious question which is why you defend him instead of considering the evidence and simply admitting theres at least a possibility that someone out there could do a better job and already actually is doing a better job with less to work with in the case of some teams well see in the playoffs. I dont ask because the answer to that question is  because he was around when those things happened and since he had the title of OC that means he must get the credit move along.America could always be better. So could this team. So could this sub. That seems like a very consistent and constructive attitude for people of my generation.,Seahawks,da7ev5y,1,t5_2ryle

10005196,1,t1_dbbothn,I agree. Tanner has shown a lot of promise honestly. His sample size is so small that you cant read it as literal but by some measures he is our most effective receiver. Again that doesnt actually mean that bc the sample size is so small but it does show you some potential. I dont know a ton about Tanners blocking but it would seems he has the physicals to get good at it. I agree with Paul as well. I dont really see the harm other than maybe to Kearse mentally which you cant base your decisions around unless they truly dont trust the other guys which I dont think is the case. That TD catch by Tanner in GB alone should get him some more chances that was beautiful.  ,Seahawks,dbbpf7t,1,t5_2ryle

10059095,0,t1_dbip08s,Wew lad my irony meter is off the charts.gtwithout talking Xs amp Os.Cue scree about how play calling results in rd and longs with no discussion of why except a false calim that its not a lack of execution.  On run plays our offense is one of the worst in the league at precontact yards.  Against the Rams Rawls had  yards before contact.  Please explain how this is the schemes fault.  Every loss we have had this year has been due to a lack of execution and not scheme with the possible exception being the Rams where it was a coaching mistake to let Russ play immediately after an injury.  Know why we obliterated the Patiriots defense even though theyre one our top competition for scoring defense this year?  Scheme.  We used Graham to occupy  defenders nearly every play because Bevell outcoached Belichick.  He knew he would double cover Graham so he used Graham at the LOS to help protect Russ while keeping  DBs tied up so Doug and Lockett could run free.  Scheme won us that game and we will be the only team to beat them with Brady playing this year because of it.In every game weve won weve scored  or more points with the exception of the Fins game where Russ was initially hurt.  In the Saints our defense gave up  consecutive scoring drives and Russ overthrew a touchdown fade that was caught just  inches too far.  Execution not scheme.In TB we played like absolute dogshit.  We couldnt protect Russ at all and he wound up with  interceptions.  But I suppose youre right Bevell should have been out there blocking for us better.  In GB Russ played his worst game ever.  We outschemed them about as much as possible on the first two drives and Russs inability to hit  wide open deep guys that would go for touchdowns sent that game down a spiral that we couldnt recover from.  If only Bevell handt thrown those  interceptions.Russ has thrown a career high number of interceptions this year blameBevell.gtWithout Russs ability to make things happen Bevells gone a long time ago. Were successful in spite of him not because of him.More baseless speculation from the same old grassisgreener emotion driven reactionary nonsense.If youre going to pretend your football knowledge is so much greater accuse me of not understanding whats going on and then post some nonsense unsubstantiated drivel about play calling at least try to back up your points.,Seahawks,dbiq37s,6,t5_2ryle

Their QBs get ages to sit back and pick apart defenses.

10097093,0,t1_dbnnes4,Im sure I could find some published work but thats sort of pointless. The main thing to consider is that bone tends to heal nicely but this is me assuming it was a clean break. I dont think theres any information on the details of Tylers break but it sounds like Pete thinks the surgery was a nice success leaving me to believe that there wasnt any major complications. Virtually how it works is the bone breaks and when correctly positioned it begins the healing process by creating a callus around the fracture. Tldr the callus forms into new bone. The tricky part is dexterity. The location of the break actually reforms into stronger bone but the issue lies with not using the leg in Tylers case. The rest of the bone around the fracture will actually become weaker over time because he hasnt been using the leg. Eventually the dexterity returns to normal and knowing the NFL Tyler will have some topnotch physical therapy to speed up the process a bit.The general consensus from past studies is that a repeat fracture isnt more or less likely to happen at the same site so this injury shouldnt effect his career at all if hes mentally up to the challenge.,Seahawks,dbnnz9g,26,t5_2ryle

10265095,0,t3_5mxkwg,I dont think the Lions game showed much about our actual ability that was just a terrible terrible team we were really lucky to get. I also think that beating the Falcons is a long shot because I have absolutely no confidence in our defense specifically our pass rush. One thing Zach Whitman tweets a lot is that disruption is not production and I agree  while our pass rush looks good looking at advanced stats and all that theyre terrible at actually closing down on quarterbacks. The Falcons are the worst oline left in the NFC race somehow and theyre still great. Since Bennetts injury this has been one of the worst pass rushes in the league failing to get consistent production against some of the worst lines in the league Panthers Rams ers. Lions were playing backups all over and it took the pass rush until garbage time to get anything consistent going.Apart from that Wilson looks more like he did v. the Bills i.e. best in the league than he did v. the Packers or v. the Lions in the first half talented but mentally shook. One good thing about the offense I dont believe that the offensive lines surprising decent appearance is sustainable is the receivers all stepping up from Baldwin to PRich to Graham to even Kearse. Receivers making the extra plays is always a playoff game changer.I think with Rubin Reed Wagner Wright and Kam all in and healthy this is an elite run defense and I dont think Atlantas RB duo will really get going. They will likely try a lot of screen passes to make up for that to GabrielFreemanColeman and we are pretty good at snuffing those out as well usually. Emphasis on usually  if the team that couldnt do so in the past shows up were practically fucked.In my opinion the game will likely be defined by how often Ryan to Julio or some forgotten open receiver gashes our secondary for big gains like they did in week  rd quarter. The reason why they were back in that game after playing a terrible first half was because the offense couldnt take advantage of anything. If theres at least consistent scoring or a field position advantage this team is definitely beatable. CowboysPackers probably less so because they match up incredibly well against our lackluster pass rush but this is probably doable. Still we definitely arent favorites here Rawls wont find the holes he magically found v. Lions again I think hes an exceptional back however and TerrellLane are obviously very worrying. Hopeful not confident. I hope we at least make the conference finals and get a good draft class in to reboost the lack of talent at certain areas though.,Seahawks,dc7lrq6,4,t5_2ryle

10337069,0,t3_5o104o,welp its been a rollercoster of a season and im somewhat sad to see this season come to an end. But we just need to get healthy.The injuries really concerned me going into the game and it clearly showed that Ryan is deserving of the MVP by how he picked us apart. Our defense honestly looked the worst it had all season but ATL was the better teamBut this game showed that the offensive line is no longer suffice and REQUIRES changes and investments over the offseason. Maybe even some coaching changes. But what we do this offseason will be crucial we need depth and that honestly was our second weakest aspect next to the line. Changes are required. this season was unacceptable.Our offense was unacceptable this WHOLE season. Oline can not be ignored anymore i truly believe that the Oline was the largest factor in every single one of our losses and Kearse needs a change of scenery. This team was just very weak mentally this year and it showed all season with the outbursts and the play showed today. Good season Hawks.

Do you know how extremely important that is? Do you think it was tom cables decision to pick up jimmy graham? Look at how sweezy and Britt turned out. An offensive line is unlike ANY other personnel in football being that it takes so damn long to develop a group that gels together. Can you tell me another coach in the NFL that has developed nobodies into offensive line studs?

10400323,0,t3_5owu5e,It was a stupid trade for the Seahawks from the moment it was conceived and anyone with a decent knowledge of the salary cap should see that. When evaluating any player the production he provides is absolutely meaningless by itself. The only thing that matters is his production relative to his cap hit. Jimmy Graham by any realistic even optimistic measure would never produce production in excess of his cap hit. His best case scenario was that he would provide production equivalent to his cap hit. Even if he hit the best case which he obviously didnt that would make his value in a trade equal to zero. The draft capital we gave up to acquire him was worth far more than zero. Players on rookie contracts account for almost all of the excess production above cap in the NFL. Trading that away for a veteran on a fair market salary is beyond stupid and it is that failure of logic that has plagued our franchise throughout PCJS time here. ,Seahawks,dcmxyvr,-1,t5_2ryle

Not to mention how the defensive side of the locker room will respond. But if you dont trade him this talk is poised to drag further into the offseason and regular season which could be a huge distraction and Sherm doesnt strike me as a guy thats going to back down. If anything hes too prideful and emotional. If this is all just trying to send a message its very likely to backfire and ruffle feathers even more. I think hes gone.

11601537,0,t3_65k48s,The Seahawks will likely attempt to find a cheap young FB of the future. We might see us draft one in the th round or make a few a priority in undrafted free agency and I would be somewhat surprised if we didnt resign Brandon Cottom to see if he could stay healthy and win the FB job. However I think Reece is still an option and a good one. I imagine if all of the front offices efforts fail to replace him with a younger cheaper option then you will see us resign him during camp assuming some other team hasnt snatched him up yet. ,Seahawks,dgb1kfr,3,t5_2ryle

11766200,0,t1_dgtpxy3,Loving the Ross option as a potential dark horse pick if hes available. I know the sub likes Zay Jones in the nd but I really do not find his play inspiring. He just seems alright. Pair up Baldwin with a major deep threat like Ross and have Jimmy work the middle....not to mention Locketts potential...damn if our OLine can just hold up decently this receiving corps would be deep. Also I wouldnt hate the Bolles pick here I just wonder if he would make much of an impact his first year with Joeckel likely slotted at LT already.,Seahawks,dgtq98v,3,t5_2ryle

11769025,0,t1_dgu0lzy,Yeah I just thought there had to be a reason Pete wanted him heavy. But right now I am primarily creating sets based around Prosise and Lacy in the backfield with or without Graham in the personnel set. There is so much we can do with that. With these two on the field their versatility can be a dynamic asset to our offense. For example our  personnel could also serve as a  personnel set and we can create additional match upsnumbers. When we get stack looks shift out Prosise and give RW a dual read. If we get favorable numbers on the perimeter dump it out. You can also shift him wide versus certain overages it could really open up DBLock. If they commit to the perimeter and take a man out the box and we get favorable numbers upfront pound it with Lacy. They probably will not do this at all but it is exciting and fun to write about. I will most likely post it here   when I am done It is easier to post footage or make a long post on Reddit. ,Seahawks,dgu1t1o,5,t5_2ryle
