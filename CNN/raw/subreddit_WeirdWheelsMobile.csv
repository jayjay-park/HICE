1573339,0,t3_2caapq,Full demo and examination of a  F CabrioMicroCoches de Barcelona  El Ingenio de Postguerra Microcar of Barcelona  the ingenuity of postwar History of The FBecause of the drop in sales and falling production numbers Autonacional introduced in fall  a more attractive car a sport version named F. This Model was intended to increase market appeal to a larger customer base by offering a stylish miniature of the worldrenowned Spanish Ferrari the Pegaso Z also from Barcelona.This tiny vehicle had a twocolour plastic body hard and softtop and a Horsepower motor. It was only capable of a  kph top speed and this didnt allow it to be taken seriously.In the beginning of  the last examples of the Biscuter were built. The market for this type of vehicle disappeared altogether with the arrival of the Spanish Fiats.Very few examples have survived.The booming popularity of the Volkswagen Beetle and Fiat  in Europe sounded the death knell for many microcars. As the sales and production numbers of its Gabriel Voisindesigned Biscuter plunged Spanish producer Autonacional S.A. sought to save itself by introducing a more attractive sporty model.The result was the F Pegasin with styling inspired by the Pegaso the Spanish luxury sports car that was then taking the world by storm. It featured a twocolor plastic body with both a soft top and a removable hardtop wrapping around standard Biscuter mechanicals including the typical nine horsepower HispanoVilliers engine. With its inset headlights split grille curvaceous body and tiny tailfins it was the rakish image of a Touringbodied Pegaso in miniature with the exception of speed. Capable of only  kmh the F suffered from the same problem as the original Corvette too sporty for those seeking economy too economical for those seeking sporty.The Pegasin failed to save the Biscuter which disappeared from production lines in the beginning of  as Spanish Fiats made their arrival on the scene. Bruce Weiners largely original example decked out with appropriate lettering and even space to apply ones racing numbers is one of the few survivors of this memorable micro sports car. It is one of only two examples stateside and it stands as an historic car that marks the end of Spanish microcar production and the beginning of the end for the European microcar industry as a whole. If the microcar had to die however it might as well have gone out putting its best face forward and pretending to be a Spanish Ferrari.This would be an interesting bookend to a microcar collection or for the sports car enthusiast with a sense of humor an ideal companion to the Pegaso in ones carriage house.The RM Auction results for the car at the Microcar MuseumLot    Biscuter F Roadster SN  SilverBlue leatherette Estimate    Visually maintained largely original  condition Hammered Sold at  plus commission of .

This is one of the cuter Biscuters with bodywork that emulates a badly shrunken and somewhat distorted Pegaso. Its weirdness and semiconventional bodywork may have escaped the passions of the bidders here and it represents one of the better values in an otherwise full retail auction.Concise Biscuter company histories with many pics Spanishgrupo.commicrocochesbiscuter.htmBiscuter History old wiki entryBackground.Raw material shortages and general economic difficulties in Europe following the Second World War made very small economical cars popular in many countries. In Spain the situation was complicated by General Francisco Francos authoritarian government which was disliked by many Western and Communist states as a remnant of Fascism. Consequently Spains economy was relatively isolated from the developed world. It operated at a lower economic level than the rest of Western Europe and was forced to develop domestic substitutes for hardtoget imported products and technologies. The Biscuter tiny simple and cheap even by microcar standards was a product of this environment and was well suited to its time and market.Origins.The car actually had its origins in France in the late s where aircraft designer Gabriel Voisin had designed a minimal car called the Biscooter. The playful name implied that it was about the size of two motorscooters or a scooter with four wheels. The design drew no interest from either manufacturers or consumers there however and he eventually licensed it to Spanish firm Autonacional S.A. of Barcelona. By the time it was introduced in  the marque had been hispanicized to Biscuter. The first car had no formal model name and was called simply the Series  but it soon became known as the Zapatilla or little shoe after a lowheeled peasant slipper popular at the time.Technical information.The Zapatilla was minimal indeed with no doors or windows or reverse gear. The  cylinder  cc twostroke motor produced  horsepower  kW had a crank starter and drove only the right front wheel. Braking was by an unusual threepoint system involving the transmission and cable ties to the two rear wheels. One genuinely advanced feature was an allaluminum body although steel was later used.History.Biscuter flourished for about ten years and the cars became a common sight on Spanish roads as well as a part of popular culture. Ugly as a Biscuter was a common joke. Amenities such as doors and windows did eventually appear and several different bodystyles were produced including trucks an elegant woodie station wagon and a toylike sports car called the Pegasun little Pegaso.The auto firm Fiat had been allowed by the Spanish government to set up a subsidiary called SEAT in  but at first even the most inexpensive of its Italian designs were considered luxury cars out of reach of the average Spanish consumer. As time went on and a greater degree of prosperity developed though SEATs began to take more of the market and crowd out the cheaper marques. By the early s Biscuter sales and production stopped after a total production run of about . It is thought that almost all of the cars were eventually scrapped.Today.Now Biscuters are mostly museum curiosities although like many vanished marques they have some following among auto enthusiasts. The name is littleknown outside Spain however and most materials pertaining to it are in Spanish. Their extreme rarity makes it likely that any surviving example would be a genuine collectible although probably not one of an extremely high value.Other Spanish MicrocarsHistory of Coachbuilder Pedro SerraSome images fromRed museum car Vintage imagesWikimedia Commons higher res availableBiscuter bare engine from a full resto of a  series worth a lookManualPegaso Z,WeirdWheelsMobile,cjdhq0i,1,t5_32c8h
