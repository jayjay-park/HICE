Oh youre flattering no youre never not an angelgtUnder your wing I see nothing  New child your hair not slick your wings are clipped   Underneath your perfect sin theres something evil happeninggtAngel you wake my sin Ive done nothing  New child mess up my dress I couldnt cry a mess  Every time that youre with me it all fits in to what you doLyrics in bold are ones Im sure are absolutely correct.
