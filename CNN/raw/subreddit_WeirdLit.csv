1154121,0,t1_chzg1sh,gtI have heard of The Mists of Avalon but I dont know much about it. Glancing at some info on it I see it won a Locus award which is probably why Ive heard of it. Ive tried to read award winning SF novels I am about  of the way through Locus  through Hugos.Yeah Marion Zimmer Bradley also wrote some science fiction as well though I dont know that she won any awards for it.  Regarding the Arthurian legend component its okay! I didnt either.  As a matter of fact it enormously boosted my interest in the topic and I ended up taking an Arthurian Lit. class in a study abroad program in the U.K.  Its a damned great story regardless of how many references you get.  The only experience with the Arthur story was from watching The Sword in the Stone a lot when I was young which isnt exactly a lot of scholarly history.  I hope you like Mists if you decide to read it and The Etched City.  Bradley is fairly well known but I do often go out of my way to make people aware of KJ Bishop because shes relatively unknown and I think shes worthy of more attention.  ,WeirdLit,chzgd2n,1,t5_30f4c
1159295,0,t1_chzafpq,Im about  pages into The Mists of Avalon and Im loving it! Im not terribly familiar with the legends of King Arthur but its still neat to see a story like that from the womens point of views. Im also really enjoying Bradleys dreamlike prose. I feel like Im in a fairy tale when I read it.,WeirdLit,ci01eh5,2,t5_30f4c
1161556,0,t3_27eopz,Henry Kuttner is generally considered a weird author I think. He published in Weird Tales and expanded on the Lovecraftian mythos. I havent yet read anything of his though so I cant recommend a good starting place. Along those lines August Derleth made considerable contributions to the Lovecraftian mythos some of which came a little before . He wrote original stories and also founded Arkham House publishing company. He wrote in a lot of other genres too including I think a little original horror and weird fiction. Alas I cant recommend any specific Derleth works either as I havent read any yet. Im cursed with reading Wikipedia articles about authors faster than I can read their actual output!I have read some Clark Ashton Smith. People really love his poetry. Almost every mention of him is immediately followed by a reference to The StarTreader. Ive read a smattering of his short stories and found that you really cant go wrong. Every one that Ive read has been fantastic but if you want a specific recommendation Id suggest The End of the Story and Genius Loci.EDIT Oh! Lord Dunsany real name Edward Plunkett is an enormously influential weird author and cleanly before . Everyone from Lovecraft to Gaiman cites him. Ive read The Book of Wonder a collection of darkish fantasy stories. Hes amazing at describing scenes and evoking particular feelings but his plotting and characterization leaves something to be desired at least for me. Still I definitely recommend checking him out.,WeirdLit,ci0akxw,3,t5_30f4c
1164966,0,t1_ci0lsnd,Thanks for the insight on American Elsewhere.   I think Ill put that one off for the time being because I suspect that I would feel much the same way about it given what youve described.  I might try out his upcoming City of Stairs when I get a chance.  ,WeirdLit,ci0of6e,2,t5_30f4c

1372609,0,t1_cio47d3,I havent read Amnesia Moon but I greatly enjoyed Motherless Brooklyn by Lethem.  We used that as the inaugural title for a book club I was in for awhile.  I think I might have Amnesia Moon though because Ive picked up a couple other of his books after liking Motherless Brooklyn.  I agree that the whole postapocalypse thing is way overplayed too but if I were to read something along those lines I feel like Lethem isnt a bad author to try.  Another cool title of his that people in here might enjoy is Kafka Americana which is a collection he collaborated on based around Franz Kafka who is my favorite author and pretty important to the tradition of weird fiction. ,WeirdLit,ciocepr,2,t5_30f4c

3076027,0,t1_cogbazj,The nice thing about Subterranean Press lately is that you can usually get ebook versions for a very reasonable price.  Which isnt the point for most people into Sub Press but its nice for those of us just discovering these authors. ,WeirdLit,cogttmh,1,t5_30f4c

4009760,0,t1_crda99i,Ive read a good deal of his stuff.  Since youre into weird Id recommend The Talisman and its sequel Black House next.  Perhaps also Liseys Story. Great article btw! ,WeirdLit,crdcd7p,3,t5_30f4c

7474488,0,t3_4hh76s,Well I started reading Joan Aikens The People in the Castle and I was surprised to find that most of the stories Ive read in the collection havent done much of anything for me one way or the other.  I dont dislike any that Ive read particularly but I suppose I can say that I find them a little too far to the whimsical side of things.  They have a lot of plot elements that I could easily see in a Kelly Link story note she wrote the intro so its apparent that theres influence there but I think Links tend to be much darker and much more interesting in terms of prose style.  Next Im going to try Jeffrey Fords A Natural History of Hell and Michael Wehunts Greener Pastures.On the writing front Ill take a second to plug The Yellow Booke Vol.  from OldStyle Tales a collection of short weirdhorror tales that is carrying one of my stories.  Its available for free at that link electronically or in print through Amazon at a price set solely to cover costs as they are a nonprofit publisher.   ,WeirdLit,d2rszrn,3,t5_30f4c

9372796,0,t1_d936qnx,Lovecraftian fiction especially one that falls directly into Cthulhu Mythos fold ought be viewed as its own subgenre at this point with its own surprisingly vast fandom. I grew tired of it as it became increasingly limited and repetitive. Folk subscribe to strict rules as to what kind of philosophy story should espouse or what can or cannot be done in order for story to be good and proper Lovecraftian horror. Not to mention sticking to rules of established lore if writer is working within Mythos as long as hisher story isnt overtly comical or downright parody.,WeirdLit,d942h65,3,t5_30f4c
