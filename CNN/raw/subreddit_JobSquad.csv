6438713,0,t1_czkuk90,Ive never really been a proponent of claiming that Dixie or Steph are bad businesswomen.  They have certainly been fortunate to be gifted their positions through nepotism and Im sure a great many people not named Carter or McMahon would do a better job but these two are not solely responsible for the shit their company doles out. I believe Vince on the other hand has such singular influence over the final product that he actually matters in the direction of the ship. For Dixie she is influenced by stature and imitation and has been known to act unprofessionally or seemingly in her own self interest. She has surrounded herself in shitty people though and cant write produce star in and promote her show all by herself.    ,JobSquad,czlav3k,1,t5_3bpx5
