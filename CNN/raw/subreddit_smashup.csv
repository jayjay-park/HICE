5448975,0,t3_3poy6y,The art is almost all from yugioh cards this time around. I would also include a rule that was too long to add to the cards you cannot activate the talents of Possessed Shells and Unholy Priestesses that already have zero power. ,smashup,cw85qm5,2,t5_2xt6g
5488744,0,t3_3ptd5k,Ive had success with Alien Elves. Their draw power helps you get your invaders going dancing root will shuffle them back in if you lose them and you can use flower child to to take a minion and then take back your own flower child with beam up or a collector. You can also combine terraforming with helping hands to screw people over by bringing out temple of goju or the nexus. ,smashup,cwd8kfp,3,t5_2xt6g
6076996,0,t3_3yqamy,Typically cannot overrides can in games. Makes me think that Wil could not have been played on the same base as block the path. ,smashup,cyg6g2i,2,t5_2xt6g
6171042,0,t1_cyr2lz4,Hmm there could be something to that strat. ,smashup,cyr30n9,2,t5_2xt6g
6839489,0,t1_d0r3rgx,Great question. I would also like to know the answer to this. Since it is ongoing and after I would assume so as long as another player moved your imperial dragon.,smashup,d0rk5vl,1,t5_2xt6g
6875945,0,t1_d0voqmz,gtHideyoshi should say on the top rather than to the top.Noted.gt I dont think you should have to discard the card Hanzo reveals if its a minion. Just return it to the top. Wil change.gt Is Nobunaga supposed to cease all power counter generation when you move another minion to the same base as him? Correct. He looses both of his effects if you move someone in with him.gt Asceticism still has minion spelled miniony and now no longer prevents returning to hand in addition to losing destruction protection.Noted the typo. And it would be redundant if I protected myself from returning to the hand by returning to the hand.,smashup,d0vpa49,1,t5_2xt6g

7352734,0,t1_d2dv3ta,Go ahead!Magical Girls are banned to play with Time Travelers. That particular combo is busted and I knew that going in design. Mechs are also pretty insane with Monkeys too.,smashup,d2dyeyu,1,t5_2xt6g
7410927,0,t1_d2kc3pv,THIS would make this card a bit better. Just reading this seems very lack luster and EXTREMELY situational since there are maybe  total cards that return to hand ability,smashup,d2kknvs,1,t5_2xt6g
7487534,0,t1_d2socvx,It depends on which factions are drafted  I suppose I seldom play p while playing p too much where managing the best combos is the only good way to get advantage.I suppose such things is bound to happen if you dont want to be left out pick myskatonic ninja spies pirates or tornados.On the other hand the left out player can get a head start on another base. Also unless people are bots they will disrupt the player who is ahead anyway.I remember a p FFA when i had just the core set and there was a dinosaur zombie player leading. We all agreed to not play minions and just focus on disrupting the zombie and close the base while after his turn while denying all his VP.,smashup,d2taj5o,1,t5_2xt6g
7526184,0,t1_d2xljyz,Do you have the cthulu expansion or super spies? Read some of your cards carefully because you can sometimes power up other players cards it doesnt have to be your own. Or destroy your own cards,smashup,d2xougc,1,t5_2xt6g
7724038,0,t3_4l12vt,Other than Smash Up I enjoy games like Rook Apples to Apples depending on who Im playing with Taboo and Catchphrase to a lesser extent Ticket to Ride Settlers of Catan Fluxx Mille Bourne Dutch Blitz and Clue.,smashup,d3k64dt,1,t5_2xt6g
7814814,0,t3_4mbycp,Generally just that the main scoring mechanic if one deck is complemented by the mechanic of the other deck. For example ponies are all about putting down multiple minions for power boosts so having a board with minions on it is very important. So pirates a deck which has a very prominent mechanic of its minions shuffling around bases instead of going it the discard is extremely useful with ponies because it keeps minions in play at all times. Other examples are ApesWizards for the action plays or AliensPlants for being able to draw your scoring minions ASAP. Second priority is that Ill choose a deck that counters one someone else has chosen. ,smashup,d3ug6ne,2,t5_2xt6g
8019089,0,t3_4oyoy8,Mines pretty basic. On the right I keep madness and all the bases except Munchkin the center has every faction in alphabetical order except Munchkin and the left holds Munchkin factions monsters treasure and bases. I dont have anything against SU Munchkin but my group only plays with that expansion if everyone wants to so its easier to keep it separated.,smashup,d4hf58z,1,t5_2xt6g
8114810,0,t1_d4rdrmz,First off everything Im about to say is p specific.  Dragons arent a real threat in PP in my opinion.Beating the Dragons in P involves either a having a way faster deck or draws strangely enough it looks like Ghost Robots can do this.  It also looks like Ghost Robots may be batt broken fast.  Cushions clued me into them in another thread. b not caring about RuinsGreat Wyrm because you dont have to break the base or can steal it Aliens or Geeks or c matching up an answer to each major threat Ninjas have  answers to Ruins  to Great Wyrm and  to Imperial DragonHatchling.  Answer a can fail to RNG and very few decks play that fast.  Answer b may run into problems if the Dragons bring an aggressive partner faction and force the issue.  Answer c functions great unless the Dragons pick the Zombies as their partner and you suddenly lose all long games.So for the most part its going to be poking at whatever weakness their partner cant cover.  ,smashup,d4s6fa2,1,t5_2xt6g

8653092,0,t3_4yexjm,I just keep every two bases with the factions they belong to and when a faction is in a game so are its bases.Shuffle all of the bases of the factions being played with and you have a good size base deck that usually lets most of them be played while providing the intended synergy between the factionsbases as well as introducing new strategies.,smashup,d6n90wn,3,t5_2xt6g

10194865,0,t3_5lwm29,I think more than basic rules the biggest confusion comes with specific scenarios where cards can contradict each other or happen in specific orders. Just go back through this sub and youll see the kinds of questions people ask. those would be more useful tutorials.,smashup,dbzn6zo,1,t5_2xt6g
10204908,0,t1_dc0g5yt,You might as well integrate it with the first faction you will feature. The core rules I have taught to people in mere seconds but teaching them their faction takes the entirety of the game itself as well as postgame discussion.  ampnbsp  A video solely for the basic rules is a waste of time watching and recording even. But hey thats just my opinion cause I dont do videos. I prefer writing.,smashup,dc0s7zk,2,t5_2xt6g

10519227,0,t1_dd0gnm3,What are you talking about one card? Its a total of at least  in the above combo  field trips and the grannies card. Plus getting back what ever minions you put on the bottom. Normally if you have field trip you wouldnt put your good minions on the bottom now you can get more cards and still play your good minions ,smashup,dd0gv10,1,t5_2xt6g
10959870,0,t1_deaekpr,So i shouldnt really care about my opponents gameplan except just building my board and playing out my turns as if im any other  faction deck. Then use my discard cards to power out a bunch of power on a base? Its hard to break into that mindset when no other faction thrives from low hand count like ghosts do.,smashup,deafljx,1,t5_2xt6g

11495790,0,t1_dfya961,Heh yeah we do I actually had put together a Weapons Manufacturer set based on the Borderlands Series.
