4855317,0,t1_cu62d1r,If she wont I will.  Though Id like to add some questions if thats alright.Those questions include Do you agree with the idea that a substantial increase to NASAs budget will help the economy?  What is your plan for NASA would we see something similar to what happend to constellation mission?  Where the path NASA was put on got drastically changed? There is a lot of debate about alternative energy but that also can include coal and gas what about consumables vs renewables? What do you think should be the focus for the energy sector renewables or consumables? Why? Do you feel that Internet providers exercise a de facto monopoly in too many parts of the country? Why why not? Is net neutrality something you support that is the concept that the Internet should have equal access no matter where it comes from? What is your plan to help get American citizens back on track to reaching the middle class status?  Would you support raising minimum wage? If so how much? What is the line in the sand regarding the TPP trade agreement that you would say veto it? in other words what would the bill have to say for you to say this isnt a good deal? What is your plan for military spending? How would you get the cost of college tuition down? what parts of the education department would you fix?Edit  its up,KasichForPresident,cu6js34,1,t5_3845w

Its not hard someone just has to express and Intrest in him and then boom you know rKasichForPresident is a thingWould you like to know more? insert link to why I like him hereIf every person on this sub started submitting Kasich articles like Bernie supporters did or simply scanned the comments looking for people that express and Intrest in him I think we start getting a lot more people.  But I should caution anyone that tries to do this you cannot care about karma and you need to really know your stuff and be able to reference it quickly.  Hell thats half the reason I wrote that Screed that is stickied on the front of this sub and keep it updated so I can use the links that I have there no matter where I am or whose computer I am using.  ugracewincer is way better at that kind of stuff than I am though.

6980243,0,t1_d17ifio,I think its a great idea! All I needed to say is out there here but if we want a group vent session I can put it there as well. I have now fully explained the situation and she is trying to fight me even more over it. Something I dont want to bring into this subreddit. I admit that pinging her name was a mistake and if you have to hear from her because of it I am sorry. I should note that besides the obvious moderator problems rRepublican is a good subreddit with good people in it. I like it much more than rConservative and any partnership that can be brokered between the two subs will bring Kasich much needed exposure. One major problem that you have found though is that nobody on that mod staff pulls for Kasich and I do not see them being friendly to an adversarial cause. Politics is about people wanting to help other people. IBiteYou and the other mods think that someone other than Kasich should be president. Not because they are evil or want the wrong person to lead for some reason but because they dont think he is the best man for the job. I can respect that but I cant respect the fact that they actively suppress the support he gets and bolsters other candidates. rRepublican should be a place for all Republicans no more no less. ,KasichForPresident,d17js5x,3,t5_3845w
6983789,0,t3_4ban4m,New York and California allocate LOTS of delegates at the Congressional district level. Gov. Kasich should be very competitive in lots of them. In fact California with its  delegates is where the campaign can coordinate with Ted Cruz to deny Trump delegates. The coastal areas are a strong point Gov.
