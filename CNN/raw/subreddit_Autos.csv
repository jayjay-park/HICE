As far as new cars were concerned for someone not wanting an SUV the Subaru really stood on its own in terms of size efficiency price and capability. ProsExtremely versatile. Not as slow as it seems on paper. Very low operating costs. Doesnt flinch when the going gets rough. Eyesight system is really awesome. Comfortable roomy and quiet. More ground clearance than most SUVs. ConsWell look at it. I didnt buy it for sex appeal though. Front overhang is really long so the nose can scrape off road if youre not mindful of approachdeparture angles. At  the seat bottoms are a tad on the short side.

647280,0,t3_218hp7,Ive driven one automatic that I really liked  it was a  Ford Focus with a dualclutch gearbox.  While it did was a drive with one half of your body sort of experience in the typical automatic fashion the lack of a torque converter meant that the throttle response was sharp like a manual and it didnt do the possessed creep forward and strain against the brakes in D bit that make automatics such an irritating experience.I recently rented a  Focus and it seems that Ford has reworked the software  it is now programmed to creep forward the only way it could do this is if it actively gives the car a bit of gas and slips the clutch and the lowspeed throttle reaction has been made artificially slushy and fluidcouplinglike.  It seems that people complained that it did not feel like a traditional slushbox and FoMoCo added a level of software compensation to make it feel like an  Taurus.I really dont care what others drive but it would be nice if automakers offered the option.  I imagine its mostly redtape... most cars that are sold in Europe are outfitted with manual transmissions.  Harmonizing FHSMV standards with global norms would alleviate this but congress will do nothing that reduces protection of the DetroitThree.Also... I wish I could rent manuals.  I used to be able to do it by demanding the dumpiest POS on the lot  they always had one Geo Metro with a manual transmission and no power steering that was mostly a prop to upsell customers to an Escort or Neon.  No more luck... Driving in an unfamiliar city D.C. for instance is twice as stressful when I have to do it with an automatic!,Autos,cgdugsy,1,t5_2qhr3

So inside each of those tips there are little valves that block off the center tips for normal everyday use thats why they are so clean and when you put the car into sport mode it opens up the valves in all the exhaust tips allowing more exhaust to pass through.

2120232,0,t3_2j6mxx,In some countries cars are taxed based on displacement. So when your L makes HP from the factory its pretty damn impressiveand partially why EvosWRXs were so wildly successful in the s and s.Other than that though I dont logically see the point of it all. The biggest shitstorms in the car community almost always stem from displacement and induction. If you say theres no replacement for displacement even though its true some smug asshole will always be quick to come out and predictably say Except turbos.And everytime OHV is discussed some psuedoproffesor will always bring up volumetric efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption as if they matter at all to the driver. I agree OP in my opinion the single most important metric of on engine should always be lb per HP. A L turbocharged  banger may very well make as much HP as my small block from the early s and it may very well make that power more efficiently.

Simply put if any Skyline post December  was not bond released after the MotoRex fiasco it is illegal if found on U.S. soil. If you see a post December  Skyline GTR or not stateside and said owner cannot provide a bond release document that car was illegally brought to the U.S. Of course the exception being the Skyline R GTR NISMO edition which can be brought in under the Show and Display rule. Limited to  milesyear. Sean Morris is the man responsible for allowing the R NISMO to be imported and he has a done a hell of a lot of work informing U.S. citizens of what the laws state. Florida is notorious for titling just about anything with an engine so if you ever browse the Miami craigslist its filled with Rs and Ss that were illegally bought and then titled in Florida. I know of one company that does it Black Ops Performance in Florida. Their website states that they will provide services to help you attain your JDM needs including importing.

They have the means to create a brand new car from the ground up and to come up with a fancy W powerplant.Hennessy on the other hand does not. This was mainly my point Hennessy is taking the Carol Shelby way imo. And tbh I wasnt aware you were targeting the price tag. You could just as easily get the base model for what? ? Granted thats more than Ill make in a decade but still. And the million dollar price tag is still cheaper than a Super Sport. I also think youre paying for the onagainoffagain worlds fastest street car thats also better looking than the Veyron. Im not justifying the price Im simply explaining the reasoning I think Hennessy is doing it. And its not like its some chopshopped LS swapped beater I mean this is still a quality machine and everything fits perfectly. Finally Hennessy has the right to charge whatever they want. There are more orders for a Venom than they can fill in a year so if people didnt think it was worth a mill then it probably wouldnt sell. In the end its your opinion that the Venom isnt worth that much and its the opinion that the buyers clearly think it is. And my opinion is that youre being a tad nitpicky and that I would take a Venom over a Veyron any day....I also recognize that neither one of us will ever own one so our opinions are just that opinions and wont affect either car.,Autos,cnimbnr,0,t5_2qhr3

You need about hp to get to mph but hp to get above . Additionally there are very few tires which can maintain their shape at the rotational forces encountered at such high velocities  even the highestrated rubber tires will not last long. This is why the land speed record holders have small wheels made entirely of aluminum alloy. People are innovating all over the place but its not a linear process,Autos,cpsi357,2,t5_2qhr3

3619305,0,t1_cq3x8rz,Apologies if I was incorrect on a few points. I havent been in the older Nissan scene for a few years now...Anyway I thought that the RBDET in the GTST line was good for about RWHP in the later models with the NEO head. The RBDETT in the GTR was rated about the same but everyone always said they dyno in the low  area. Its still hearsay but I tend to believe it with the similar derating of some of the other Japanese cars of the era. See this article The GTR wasnt the only car derated to fit the pact. That dyno is pretty damning though. Wonder how much age and abuse has to do with that if anything. EDIT Reading that thread a lot of people are saying thats uncommonly low.These days the R GTR doesnt stack up very well against brand new cars but thats a relatively recent thing. The Mustang and Camaros used to handle poorly only the latest generation is really setting good times around tracks.Either the new Mustang or Camaro would be the better car but Ive driven a Challenger and it felt like a boat. Apart from the looks I dont have any interest in the Challengers and even the SCCA class systems have them as an F class. The  Mustang GT is still F class as well surprisingly. The new Camaro Z is an A class as are pretty much all of the Vettes. Unfortunately the R isnt here but Id be curious to see where it would land. For comparison the th gen Supras are B class zx is C z and z range from C to A depending on options. Based on those I still think itd class pretty well a B at a minimum. Source PDFSCCA classes of course arent really a great way to compare cars but as a point of comparison of raw performance I still dont believe that the R would get completely beaten around a track though in a straight line it has no hope against any of the modern Vs. I agree completely that they arent worth the money today. If you could get one for what its actually worth instead of paying the Ricer Tax and import fees itd still be a good buy for a midrange sports car. That being said I dropped off the Nissan bandwagon eventially and bought an LS Corvette myself. Couldnt be happier.,Autos,cq4tsl4,2,t5_2qhr3

3620468,0,t1_cq4xzdp,Yeah saying they handle poorly is really an exaggeration. Its all relative and its hard to keep it all in perspective. But seriously whod have thought that the new Camaro handles the Nurburgring so well? Amazing really.Im still pretty new to Chevy modding but would the LS bolt in place of the LS in the F bodies? I have no idea. Id think the engine would bolt into the chassis but I know the LS Corvettes got different transmissions than the LS Corvettes and of course its mounted in the rear so it cant really be used in other cars too easily. I dont know if the Trans Am bellhousing will mate up with the LS. If you already have the LS you might get more for your money with a supercharger than an engine swap.I absolutely love my Corvette. I used to have a supercharged z which made about the same horsepower but the difference in torque is mindblowing. If I had known the C would be this good I may have spent the extra money on a C instead. Though the money saved could easily go towards a supercharger which would be a lot of fun.,Autos,cq4ykre,2,t5_2qhr3

If I wanted low level basic comfort Id go for an E AMG my father used to have a  model and it was excellent fun but the interior was plastic and cloth felt a bit basic. Used Bentley is the best option I think but if its a new car youre after and with a luxury car I most certainly hope it is then the Jaguar XJL is the best choice the interior is the best this side of Rolls and it is very quick and easy to drive,Autos,ctitacm,-1,t5_2qhr3

You can go cheap on the screwdrivers a  set from Harbor Freight will last you a decade easily. That set above does have a screwdriver w removable bits though  Oh and with that socket set above youll find you dont need the wrenches much.BTW all those allinone sets are pretty good for most needs.

I dont understand this sense of entitlement everyone seems to have now.Digging a ditch pays hr because thats what digging a ditch is worth. If you want hr for digging a ditch theyll just find someone who will do it for  and there will be plenty who are willing. You need to look at the value youre providing not just say Im working just as many hours so I should get paid the same. A guy working  hours to provide highly technical support for a huge company provides more value than a guy working  hours cleaning up the shit in a stable.Living a comfortable life is not a right. Having a family is not a right. Its something you choose to do. You shouldnt start a family just expecting someone to drop money in your lap so you can support said family. If you decide to have a family great! But plan ahead for a way to support them.For the record I dont have my own car wash and Im far from rich. I live in an apartment and am up to my eyeballs in school debt. But guess what I dont expect anyone to get me out of that debt but me. I dont expect someone to pay me double the going rate for the job I do. I expect to work hard provide as much value as I can and then be compensated appropriately for it. ,Autos,d7gumkn,2,t5_2qhr3
