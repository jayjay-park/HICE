226824,0,t1_cf40aep,Engineer fixitguy and onair pm from the other side of the country here! While most of what I do is hardware implementation and configuration I do a lot of the automation side of software as well.Weve been using WideOrbit as a guinea pig in our Hot AC station for the last  months and so far its great! Compared to the RCS lineup its less intimidating to new users and generally has a more Aesthetic UI. The features are pretty much the same just much more accessible. That and it actually feels like were running a station thats not stuck in the s. We replaced all of our outdated hardware  years ago when we moved buildings and WO gave me much less of a headache when setting up than NexGen. Well be making the switch in our other  stations within the next month!,radio,cf49a8g,1,t5_2qht3

3494974,0,t1_cpo791i,Primarily in it for a unique service to the community.  Theres nothing that targets our area or reports on weathertraffic for our area we are at a much higher elevation than any of the other radio stations so our information can be very different.  Theres also an element of personal passion in terms of learning about the RF equipment electronics and whatnot.  Youre absolutely right that if I wanted to just play radio Internet is easiercheaperetc but Im thinking this will go a bit beyond that.,radio,cpqnhdz,1,t5_2qht3

Ive spoken to my SO and after hearing that others have never heard of the school he has agreed that he will only pay for it if he can find people working radio in our market who recognize the program and agree its worth it. and they cant be just alumni  my rule,radio,d02l85t,1,t5_2qht3

9648793,0,t1_da2admj,You should always listen to the beginning and end of a song before playing it. Back in the old days this was imperative... or just to know otherwise know the song. Its not as important now as most radio stations work on automation and the next song will start playing once the previous goes down to a certain level. As well as that larger stations have control board operators. At our local college station people talk right over the song... like almost half a minute after the vocals start... I am really curious if they even hear what they are doing...haha.. Anyway.. have fun with it! ,radio,da2ewgv,2,t5_2qht3

10679705,0,t3_5soduk,Frankly a buildings a building.You can go all out Google HQ style things or you can have a more traditional office layout. The research for that is the same for this industry as it is for any other.As for studios you need good soundproofing. That means soundproof insulation drywall everything. Then you put some foam or other stuff on the walls to kill the reverb. If you want windows theyll need to be soundproof too.Mics are best placed opposite one another but putting them on big articulating arms is probably best. Generally you want the studio set up for people to stand while they talk but some people may want chairs so youll need tall office chairs.EDIT Theres some research on room shape for better sound and if you wanted to really nuance this you could read up on it. I dont know much about it but something about not having parallel walls and using a slanted ceiling.,radio,ddhj41i,1,t5_2qht3
11276067,0,t3_60vvh6,I cant imagine that there is any legal issue unless the posts are copywritten AND someone wanted to make a claim.   uInCoffeumVitaWhile I see no issue with reading the posts with attribution lying about where they came from is just plain bad ethics. However it seems to be in the same vein of certain stations with nationwide affiliation using imaging containing voices of people this station rocks I love this station etc. and those voices have never heard the station much less have an opinion about it. Good ethics? Probably not. Entertaining radio? Probably.,radio,dfa4ji6,2,t5_2qht3
