8419788,0,t3_4urb30,Hi there I sense that you are on your fourth lifetime.  Your first was in Cuba in the late s.  You were female and you were involved in witch craft during this lifetime.  It came naturally to you to become advanced in this craft because you were very intuitive and mildly psychic.  I sense you enjoyed working with the elements the most and you became quite proficient at it.  Some people respected you some feared you and others hated you.  You were fairly reclusive especially in your later years.  You didnt like to draw attention to yourself because of the negative reactions you often got.  You passed away in your late s due to a lung infection.Your second lifetime was in Romania in the mid to late s.  You were female and you were very social and joyful.  You loved to chat with others and have parties.  You couldnt stand being alone and you always had something to say or share.  People admired you greatly and many women wanted to be like you.  You always wore beautiful dresses and you did your hair nicely.  You disliked being told no.  You got married in your early s and had six kids.  You also had a love of animals especially dogs.  You passed away in your mids due to hypertension.Your third lifetime was in China in the mid to late s.  You were female and you had a difficult life.  You lived in a poor area with very little resources.  You often begged for food and you barely had anything to call your own.  Your mother was rough with you a lot and treated you like a servant.  You were depressed for many years but a part of you knew there had to be more to the world than what you saw around you.  You died in your late s due to dehydration.  People bring bits and pieces from their previous lifetimes with them into their current one.  I sense you brought your psychic abilities and interest in witchcraft from your first lifetime your social nature and love of animals from your second and your ability to see outside of the box you are in from your third.  I hope this helps some let me know if you have any questions   Also please share my link  thanks D,Clairvoyantreadings,d5u0lvh,2,t5_3esrs
9497233,0,t1_d9jn0vm,Youre welcome   The future is not written in stone if you want people to recognize how amazing your art is then you need to put that intent into it.  I sense right now youre not embracing how amazing it is thus others arent able to embrace it either.  Thank you for PMing me your FB link by the way I really like your art   I feel it has a certain charm and charisma that a lot of art lacks.  The more you truly feel your art deserves to be loved and cherished the more it will be.  You have the talent now you just need the selfesteem to go with it.  I hope this helps let me know if you have any more questions ,Clairvoyantreadings,d9jqie3,1,t5_3esrs

9930346,0,t1_db1ui17,I had a male cat who was white and a tortoise shell coloured girl with white patches  the girl was definitely the strong one as my boy was a little bag of nerves since the day we got him! He was extremely psychic though so what you said does make sense. Am I missing any communication from them?,Clairvoyantreadings,db1y6pq,1,t5_3esrs

10993809,0,t1_dee1g7g,Thanks. Ill keep this in mind. Ive been kind of trying meditation but its been a struggle. I just have... Some issues with trusting my intuition. Before I ever got fascinated in the paranormal it seemed like I was only ever right when I ignored it.. Should I meditate and not force expectations or would meditating with the intent to improve intuition work?,Clairvoyantreadings,dee43qi,2,t5_3esrs
11248424,0,t3_608ort,Hi there I sense that you have four guides.  The leader is Mary and the helpers are Jack Travis and Julia.  Whenever you have a life or spiritual question just call on one or more of them verbally or mentally and ask them the question.  They will respond within a week and the message will usually be in the form of song lyrics andor written word.  You will know the message is for you because youll feel a strong pull towards it and it wont be difficult to decipher.I hope this helps let me know if you have any questions ,Clairvoyantreadings,df6zqbm,3,t5_3esrs
11381233,0,t1_dfj9g4a,It sounds like she wants to be able to hear them in the moment which is entirely possible  you just need to learn how to open yourself up the right way. What works for one doesnt work for all . . . you should try meditating on it and try to focus on all the different layers of voices inside your head until one feels right.,Clairvoyantreadings,dfm1kwo,2,t5_3esrs
