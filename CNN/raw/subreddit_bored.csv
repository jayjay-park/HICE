Read a book go for a walk watch a movie climb a mountain do drugs get an archery set get some sidewalk chalk.You have plenty of options that arent on the computer and I bet you anything there is something youve been meaning to do for a while but havent gotten around to it.

11319372,0,t1_dfegsud,Yea didnt make me any happier but it actually managed to help me confront my depression.  Show helped me realize how common depression can be and that people can be pretty good at hiding it thus dont feel quite as alone in feeling this way.  Also helped me understand how its always better to confront the problems you face in life head on instead of hidingrunning away from them.  ,bored,dff15rd,1,t5_2qhmu
