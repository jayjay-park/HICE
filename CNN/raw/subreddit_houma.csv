East side is a bit more run down and seedy in my humble opinion. Id tell you to stay on the west side of Houma but it will likely increase your commute quite a bit. Youll have to learn alternate routes to get to the East side tunnel the twin span to get there because the canal bridges are unreliable at best. Id say try the Canterbury apartments which will put you farther away but they are decent and close to the local mall movie theatre and the various shopping centers. ,houma,ck6qsw5,1,t5_2spk3
