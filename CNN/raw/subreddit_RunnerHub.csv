2956931,0,t3_2tgr60,PlayeruAlverd    CharacterFell Onyx    GMuslashandburn    RunCome in From the Cold     Interior of a dive bar midafternoon an ork stands behind the bar chatting with a dwarf sitting on one of the stools.  The place is mostly empty but the door opens and an elven woman limps in.    Farouq glances up sees Eleria and gives a small frown You look like shit.    Felix turns around to see the damage Aye girl youve been through the ringer havent ya.    Eleria slowly steps up to the bar and eases onto a stool Two whiskey doubles Farouq Im sore as hell.    Farouq pours her a drink then refills Felixs beer sensing that information will be forthcoming.    Eleria sighs and then winces.  Well it was bound to happen hubris already bit me in the ass.      Got a call for a job the meet with the Johnson was at what had to be a Vory club Im not anything close to an expert but I dont think that many hard looking russians could be anything else.  Got to the meet just on time to see the Johnson and another of the team sharing a bottle of vodka.  Decimating might be a better word for it.  Anyway get to the table about the same time as the rest of the team sit down and start to discuss business.      I should have known something was up with me because I was twitchy hyper jumping the Johnsons sentences and basically forgetting pretty much all the rules of professionalism.  Ater the guy at the table with the Johnson calms me down a bit we get all the details head to Sibera track down a friend of the Johnsons and get him in from the cold pretty much literally.  Complications were that there was probably a Yak hit squad looking for the guy you know those guys never give up and we were stepping into someplace pretty foreign to most of us without anything more than an origin point for the search.    Next morning after shopping for some new gear to deal with the cold we hopped a flight pretty nice digs but something was still off for me just wasnt feeling right and there was some misgivings in the back of my mind I just couldnt pin down.  Did a little bit of talking on the plane but nothing really serious just enough to get some basics from the rest of the team.  The guy with the Johnson the night before turned out to be something of a running legend Last Call Celtic was handling magic support Jax was on matrix stuff and Akuly was another adept connected to the Vory I believe.    We touched down all jetlagged to hell but still wired hit up the safehouse provided by the Johnson and hit the town looking for info and scouting the place out.  Celtic Akuly and I hit a bar first but Celtic and I stood out like sore thumbs.  Akuly started making friends right away though.  Last Call had decided to wander the town when we got a DNI that hed spotted a Yak looking a bit out of place and was tailing him. I left to back him up and Celtic decided to leave the bar to Akuly at about the same time though Im not sure what he went to do.    Last Call and I managed to work an ambush of the Yak easily enough though I should probably pick up some languages because relying on Last Calls limited Japanese made talking to the Yak to distract him tough.  It did the job though Last Call landed such a perfect shot that the Yak dropped like a sack of potatoes I didnt even have to shut him up.  We carried him to on of the blandest NoTell Motels Ive ever seen place just had a vending machine for keys not even a clerk of any kind.  Last Call had apparently spotted it before finding the Yak.  We good coptorture copped the Yak and he spilled some of what he knew but I just couldnt shake the feeling that he was holding things back even after all the punishment Last Call gave him.  We snagged his commlink to take back to the safehouse and give to Jax to see if he could make heads or tails out of it.    Convening in the other room we had Jax started to work on the commlink but didnt have any luck with it he ate a databomb on the contacts apparently and got nothing but a game out of the one other file he got open before he deemed it time to rest.  About that time we found out what Celtic had done when he left the bar as his spirit returned to tell him hed found the target at an abandoned base with decent magical defenses and who knows what else.    With that bit of information we started discussing plans I couldnt shake the feeling that we were in for something bad and argued for taking off for the base immediatly but everybody was tired so I was overruled.  I just felt off though so when I went to try and sleep I layed everything out ready to go and kept my armor on. I guess that turned out to be a bad idea though because while I slept soundly enough it wasnt restful so I wasnt thinking to clearly when a couple supressed shots went off in the hall.      I immediately jumped up and went for the door still half asleep forgetting to use any of my abilities and more stupidly not taking the time to size the threat up.  I knew Celtic hadnt been as paranoid as I was so he wasnt armed up when things went pearshaped.  So groggy and half out of it I jumped the first big guy I saw after I threw the door open.  I had a fineblade out and lunged into him but its just caught an armor plate and skittered off.  The guy turned to me got me in a lock and then fired a pistol point blank center mass.  It ripped right through my coat and all I saw was colored lights.    I came to a short while later covered in my own blood still hurting like hell but alive apparently wed taken quite the beating mostly I think because of my hasty actions. if Id waited for Celtic to get suited up and thought for a moment things might have gone much better.    Last Call and Celtic finish patching everybody up best they can and we find out the Vory whore supposed to help us have flipped to a rival faction selling us out to the Yaks.  Taking that as a sign that we should get moving regardless of circumstance we head out to the base.  Celtic astral projects to avoid the physical traps gets inside and lets the target know were friendlies and we hole up while waiting for the alternate transportation the Johnson arranged to show up.      The other Vorys try to clean up the mess but its honestly just a bloodbath for them our target was a god with a sniper rifle and Last Call and Akuly nearly matched him.  I popped off a few rounds on my steyr but at that range I doubt it did more than distract them plus it was over pretty damned quickly.  We take the Vorys vehicles hit an airstrip nearby and get to enjoy a much less comfortable ride home.      While everything went to drek there for a while the Johnson was more than impressed with how quickly wed handled the job even gave us commcodes to get in touch with him hes a bigshot too high up in the Vory here in Seattle.    Eleria takes another shot and winces a bit  Anyway Last Call and Celtic did a decent job of patching me up but those ribs are still cracked I think and its gonna take a little while for that to stop hurting.    Felix and Farouq look at each other and shake their heads almost in tandem.  We told you the shadows were brutal and not to get cocky girl the dwarf finally says.    At least you lived through that mistake Im sure youll take a moment and think the next time something like that happens  the ork adds.  Have another drink itll help the pain.

So excited that he didnt seemed to be bothered by the rather meager pay but the J explained that the money went into the information.After a short chat with the owner of the location a gas station doubling as a nukeproof safehouse a squad of Yakuza showed up and surrounded the station. One of the yakuza a young one challenged one of us to a duel of honor. A trap obvious but our muscle Shredder was so excited that he did not care and just ran out and began to throw his armor off getting completly naked in the process watching him was like watching a train wreck you just cant take your eyes off. the images are forever burned into my mind. The duel began and was over very quick with the yakuza getting bisected by shredders chainsaw. He took the following bulletstorm from the remaining Yakuza like a champ but got downed none the less. I managed to pop some heads and then the owner of the shop immolated half of them.The owner provided us with a new location a casino in which I managed to insert myself in a high stakes poker game with the local Yakuza boss a CEO and a few pro poker players. It got close few times but I won the location of Mr. Seattle and managed to stay anonymous throughout the game. I also made some Nuyen on the side.A car chase and an encounter with Aztec ninjas and SK elite troops helicopter and all including but not limited to Shredder flattening a SK elite on his truck  SK elites ambushing  Aztec Ninjas failing horribly and losing  in the process Hermes hijacking a car and crashing it into the rest and a Combat Heli shredding the Aztec Ninjas. Also Hermes fell unconcious for a few seconds losing heartbeat and brain activity but was fine afterwards.We found Mr. Seattle in the end and brought him to my condo he was very grateful and thanked us for his rescue.

Getting out she notices the looks from those around  her car is easily worth more than theyve seen or will see in their entire lives. Their looks change when they see her tattoos. Stealing a car from some slumming wageslave is one thing.  Stealing from the Kenrankai in Puyallup is another thing altogether. She walks around to the trunk and levitates a large bag from her smuggling compartment. Those around begin to actively avoid even looking near her. Kenran and Awakened?She floats the bag over to the door where an associate eager to make themselves useful and thereby move up in the association takes it. She leaves without a second look.

At this point hes practically got his own spot where he can sip a good soy beer and munch on bar food as he relaxes. Hes browsing the latest issue of Soldier of Fortune looking all the new toys and guns he wants but cant afford right now when the call comes in from his fixer.Your reps pretty solid Petrus always nice to work with professionals. Youll find myself coming highly recommended as well. GrendelShotgun toting MuscleThe guy is good Reynard will give him that. It takes skill to make shell game work especially if your mark has a good pair of cybereyes doing play by play. But this one has it down smooth as silk. Reynard was passing by and saw him fleecing a couple of marks. It was like Raven whispered in his ear...a fun little prank. When the guy tried the next mark he couldnt believe his eyes when the ball was actually still in its cup thanks to a little magic from Reynard. Of course he had no intention of actually paying the guy and one of the marks that had won earlier stepped up threateningly to make the winner sulk off. By the time Reynard was already a block away.As he continued on towards his destination a small talismonger shop he got a video message from his fixer. The mans voice is deep and his tone jovial as always. A false front though Reynards seen his fixer pull a mans head off before and act like it was nothing. But its a message about a job and Reynard could always use some more work. Dude sign me up. Gotta get dat nuyen you know?. ReynardManipulation MageFaceIts quiet.
