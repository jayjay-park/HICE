29021,0,t1_cehqbc1,Paperwhite is quite a bit faster with page turning though the Aura doesnt have the flashing issues with screen transition that the Paperwhite has. The Paperwhite has GB onboard with no expansion so if you need more than that either get an Aura which has expandable storage or make friends with Amazons cloud. The Aura has kind of a greenish tint to its backlight while the Paperwhite is a more natural white thats easier on the eyes and the Paperwhite has sharper contrast. Pricewise unless you get the G enabled Paperwhite youre looking at a higher pricepoint for the Aura. Honestly I have both and only one is in my bag every day. Paperwhite hands down.,kobo,cehqikx,1,t5_2rqj6
241426,0,t3_1wssor,As per Kobos website the only limited warranty available in India is for the Kobo Aura HD which is  more expensive. So I have concluded that there is no warranty for the Kobo Glo in India.  Kobo recently launched their line in India. I didnt find any contact for support other than a customer care number. Kobo was my first choice as well. But given these facts I am going to have to go for PW and rely on calibre for converting books. Most of my books are text based so conversion shouldnt be a huge problem. I tried converting many of my ePubs into AZW and using these on the kindle app on my phone. Runs well. Hope I dont encounter problems in the long run,kobo,cf5rxkb,1,t5_2rqj6
1800804,0,t1_ck5nftt,I read most graphic novels which sometimes is full black and white so this isnt a big problem to me i think. About the screen being to small well this could be a problem yes. But i dont know if a tablet is good for reading on long period of times. Im trying a kobo because i cant read on PC its too much things happening around and my focus go to nowhere heh.,kobo,ck65c9r,1,t5_2rqj6
2126902,0,t1_cla4qsj,Its unreadable right now And it was better weeks ago when I stopped reading because of the ghosting. Its becoming worse with the time and even when Im not reading.,kobo,cla6c2m,1,t5_2rqj6
2151398,0,t1_clcyjcn,No worries I remember I had all sorts of trouble getting all of the tags to go through and display properly. For some reason kobo does not use standard epub files they actually use there own variation called kepub so somethings just dont work quite right without conversions or weird workarounds.,kobo,cldai3q,1,t5_2rqj6

3572804,0,t3_2svvs2,I read a lot and the battery lasts for  to  months for me. Over  hours of reading so far since I got it in October with the perorder.I dont tend to go over  brightness as my eyes are very sharp even when I read late at night. WiFi is also always turned off.,kobo,cpzizyg,2,t5_2rqj6
4617052,0,t3_3e2acq,Was a Kindle owner but needed something with a backlight using a head torch any longer was going to get me smacked by Mrs HC. Tried the Kindle Paperwhite and it was awful at night  bright spots dim spots visible lightpipes...I was already hating the Amazon we own your books philosophy this was just the final straw.,kobo,ctck35b,1,t5_2rqj6

8313995,0,t3_4tfaa3,My old kobo touch also died after about three years in the same way it just started freezing and it became annoying enough that I needed to upgrade. Up until that point it was fine and I personally feel like three years was a decent life for a gadget like that but obviously your opinion may vary on how long one can reasonably expect an ereader to work. ,kobo,d5gt0q8,1,t5_2rqj6
8668863,0,t1_d6oq7pj,Damn. Well at least its not an issue with the Kobo! A lot of those solutions seem to involve restoring it and since I cant back it up right now Ill hold off. I never thought Id say this but thank God my mother uses a Mac...,kobo,d6p880s,2,t5_2rqj6
8855316,0,t3_51hf05,One of the few times for tech that it pays to live in Canada. Walked to my nearby Chapters and grabbed one. Guy at the store said he sold about  already but still had another  in stock.  Im a Kindle transfer so first time using a Kobo. So far Im liking it. The screen real estate is very very nice.  ,kobo,d7ca828,3,t5_2rqj6
8861255,0,t1_d7cyi4u,Nah that was just for video streaming devices particularly Chromecast but some others also that dont work with Amazon Prime Video. Several Kobo and Nook eReaders are currently available on Amazons US site from rd party sellers some with Prime shipping.Youd think the same logic would apply but ,kobo,d7czxt8,3,t5_2rqj6
