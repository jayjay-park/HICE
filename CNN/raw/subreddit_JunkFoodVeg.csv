8811537,0,t3_50ualt,In Finland many places sell similar thing as kebab ranskalaisilla or kebab with frieschips as in dnerkebab meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Very popular not at all vegetarian.  Loads of people make it veganveg style at home tho as the dish has a long history. First as makkaraperunat deep fried sausage bits with fries that wikipedia pic has all sauces and relishes on it will fuck up your shirt when drunk guaranteed from small grill stalls and later kebab shops. I think brits can relate.Id love to get one of these when out drinking like  in the morning.,JunkFoodVeg,d770zhb,2,t5_3ddso
9063528,0,t3_54f34n,Image has nachos on the bottom bean sauce on top recipe below and some grated emmental cheese coleslaw chunky salsa and some chipotle sauce.  Also goes very well with burritos bread or rolls hell Ive even eaten it with pasta.  Ingredients   dl of soy grit  dl of broad bean grit  can of crushed tomatoes g  can of kidney beans  can of white beans in tomato sauce pured Spices  shallots or one big onion  cloves of garlic more the merrier  tsp smoked paprika  tsp paprika  tsp chili flakes  or less for children adults can use table condiments  tsp whole black peppers  tsp coriander seeds  tbsp brown sugar  tsp jeera   tsp dried oregano  tsp dried basil  drops of liquid smoke ie.  splashes  tbsp apple cider vinegar or white balsamic vinegar  tsp salt Oil I use lots of rapeseed and splash of roasted sesame oilMethod  Put the soy and broad bean grits to a container pour over some hot water until the water level is briefly visible above the grits. Leave them to soak up the moisture. Chop the onions and garlic finely blitzing in a blender is a good way to do this. No need to wash or rinse the blender bowl yet. Pour oils into the pan this one needs the oil so dont be stingy if youre using roasted sesame oil too you probably dont need liquid smoke later. When the oil is hot add paprika and chili after a minute add and saut the onions. Pour the white beans with tomato sauce in to the blender and blitz until silky smooth. If you have some onion residue in the bowl all the better. Add soy and broad bean grits to the pan and stir well. When its warmed up add the kidney beans and crushed tomato stir again thoroughly and allow to warm up again. Crush the coriander seeds and black peppercorns in a mortar with salt. If youre using fresh jeera seeds add those too and grind into powder. Add to the pan and you guesses it mix again. More blitzed white bean paste as well as the rest of the spices lower the heat and cover with a lid. Cook slowly for  minutes.Simmer without a lid for a bit if it seems too runny end result should be more of a stew than dripping sauce.If you use whole spices and crush them just before the end result is even better.  The ingredients dont have a lot of oils or fat so use what ever good oil you like using but use it liberally. I basically covered the bottom of my pan with rapeseed oil then added a tablespoon or two of the roasted sesame oil.  ,JunkFoodVeg,d81afui,2,t5_3ddso
