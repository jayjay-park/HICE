9958845,0,t3_5aug7e,depends on the frame kinda but I ended up enjoying a hybrid of Wilson KGut which they dont make anymore but I still have tons of and MSV Focus Hex. Ill also substitute Sensation or another nice soft multifilament for the KGut. And sometimes Ill try out a different Poly instead of the Focus Hex like a Luxilon or something.,RacketStringers,db5nvtz,1,t5_3f9z3
