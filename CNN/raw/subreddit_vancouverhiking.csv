199685,0,t3_1vym8r,I was born and raised in Lynn Valley and I am pretty familiar with most of the trails. The two major hiking areas are Lynn Headwaters and Lynn Canyon. Lynn Headwaters offers several hiking options including a trail called Lynn Peak that leads to a decent view Norvan Falls which leads to a neat waterfall spot and offers access up the back of Grouse via the Hanes Valley Trail and two sections of the Baden Powell trail one leads west towards the Cleveland Damn and the other leads east towards Deep Cove. Lynn Peak is a steep climb that gets to a good lookout of Lynn Valley and Burnaby. I would recommend it. It isnt the best view of the North Shore mountains but if you live in Lynn Valley it has easy access and has some beautiful sections. Baden Powell towards Deep Cove is very nice. It goes down though Lynn Canyon than up into the Seymour River Canyon. Because you end up at ocean level you descend more than you ascend. That being said there are some steep climbs. Occasionally you see some backyards... but thats part of the Baden Powell experience. Lots of runners and dog walkers use the trail. You can easily bus back from Deep Cove. I definitely recommend especially on days when you dont feel like a major workout.Baden Powell towards Cleveland Damn is also pretty neat. Ive only hiked it twice I think. You cross some neat water pools and streams and you end up hiking through some beautiful forest. All being said I usually go from Cleveland Damn to Lynn Headwaters. I would recommend but I like the Deep Cove direction better. Norvan Falls is... a bit boring. Ive never been a huge fan. It is a quick and flat hike and I dont find that it offers very much. The forest can be nice on a sunny day but theres so many other hikes that offer that and more. It is an easy hike though and I would recommend doing it at least one time part of the fun of hiking is seeing new areas. I have hiked the Hanes Valley trail and it is beautiful and the only reason to hike Norvan Falls in my opinion but its a more advanced hike. If you decide to do it make sure you bring food water and an emergency kit. Generally I hike the Hanes Valley Trail in the opposite direction Grouse to Lynn Headwaters and it takes me about  or  hours I dont push that hard and I like to rest and enjoy the views. The Norvan Falls section would be the last section of the Hanes Valley Trail. Keep in mind that hikers have gotten lost on the Hanes Valley trail. From Lynn Canyon you can also access the Baden Powell trail down to Deep Cove you just cut off a neat board walk section. You can also access the Seymour Demonstration Forest I think the name has been changed but Im too lazy to look it up. In the Demonstration Forest area you would find Rice Lake a network of gravel trails a  KM paved trail for cyclists and rollerbladers and some other natural trails Ive only explored the Fishermans trail while running. It is a beautiful area and I intend to do some more exploring. I suspect there must be a trail to access Seymour Mountain but I have not confirmed that. Other things I have heard but remain unconfirmed A trail from the top of Fromme Road that goes up to Fromme Mountain and a road that goes from the top of Mountain Highway up to Grouse Mountain. PS When you say cross the river at the end of Lynn Valley road I suspect youre referring to the access into the Seymour Demonstration Forest. I mentioned that you can access the Seymour Demonstration Forest from Lynn Canyon. These are two different access points to the same area. PPS When you are exploring the North Shore Mountains make sure of the following  Bring enough water and food. Let somebody know where you are going and what time you expect to return. Bring a first aid kit and an emergency kit if you are unsure of what to carry there are lots of resources online to assist.  Make sure you give yourself enough time to return before sunset.  Bring extra warm layers. Weather can change very quickly. I have encountered difficult weather even in August.   Before you go make sure you familiarize yourself with the trail. Most of the trails I have mentioned are well marked but it isnt that difficult to get turned around. Know what landmarks to expect.Have fun!,vancouverhiking,cf16pu2,4,t5_2usa1

4684760,0,t3_3ezrww,There are A LOT of ripe blueberries in that area right now so consequently a lot of black bears. I was up there on Monday and had the pleasure of startling one who ran away thankfully and then being able to observe a family of three on one of the ski hills. Be bear aware ,vancouverhiking,ctl25ha,1,t5_2usa1
10365663,0,t3_5ofows,Grouse only has one trail out to Dam Mountain along Thunderbird Ridge and back. If you have a locals pass its not the worst. I just wouldnt spend  just for that trip. Pros its short so its easy to head back if your hips start to protest.Cypress or Seymour the park trails are great the resort trails are meh.Last weekend I saw someone in Vans slipons at what point did thay sound like a good idea? so youll be more prepared than many out there.,vancouverhiking,dcj0ded,2,t5_2usa1
