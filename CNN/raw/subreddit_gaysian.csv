545373,0,t1_cg1pmd7,Well one big thing is that I feel being raised in a smaller community gives you an actual sense of community. Sure there can be one in New York or Los Angeles but theres so much stratification and segregation amongst the individual groups. Having lived in North Dakota even if there was someone I didnt like I had to learn to get along with them no matter what simply due to the fact that the town was so small. I think that taught me the idea that people arent and should not be treated as expendable. Just cause you dont like someone doesnt mean you can just toss them aside because there are billions of others on the planet. You learn to appreciate people for who they are no matter what. Another thing is you learn to appreciate peoples company. Being from a small town there isnt as much to do  less restaurants less barsclubs even less films at the theater! You learn to center your time around your loved ones and not necessarily any activity. Whens the last time you just hung out with someone without having to do anything and NOT feeling anxious or bored because of that inactivity? I guess my perspective is that if youre spending time with someone it should be about the person... not the setting the event or the activity. Yet perhaps on a simpler note you learn to appreciate stillness nature and more idyllic environments. I feel like environment definitely has a role in a persons development. I couldnt imagine being a child raised in a harsh dogeatdog urban populace such as New York. Its honestly a little unsettling but then again people do adapt. Im just glad that I had this kind of upbringing because I feel like it made me into a calmer much more relaxed person. Then again Im biased hahah. ,gaysian,cg29kl5,1,t5_2tg5w

It would be just as acceptable to say No whites. But for some reason in this reality we live in its okay to say No blacks no Asians. Why? Why?? I dont understand. I will never understand.

2442511,0,t3_2l8hre,The Gay Community is a hotbed of racism and white privilege. It steamrolls those who do fit into the idealized notion of what a gay man should be. In effect gay asian males are shoved under a bus in this perverse delusion that all gay people want equality. The crux of your question is is to whether you are treating your partner based on the substance of his character and not just a dirty old retired stereotype that many people with oriental slants have about gay Asian men. An effective argument would be to assert your admiration for who he is and how that endears you. Depending on the context. Gay Asian Men Suffer the brunt of racial oppression and domination and some of us choose to accept it. Because we feel we cant do any better. To be an effective ally is to listen to the plights of gay asian men and not allow yourself to be blinded by your privilege. ,gaysian,cmdlkwl,1,t5_2tg5w

4879157,0,t3_3grpp7,Im  Asian born and raised in Boston MA. By my experiences I have generally been pretty lucky and have not faced many kinds of anti Asian sentiments. There are plenty of guys out there who yes advertise that they only prefer certain ethnicities and so those are generally the guys I dont interact with. Ive had on a few occasions where Ive reached out to a guy through an app or even in person and they say they arent interested. The key is not taking it to heart and making it about yourself. Not everyone is going to like your flavor and thats ok. Its not a big deal. Its all about preference. I have been subject to certain stereotypes like being feminine or having a small dick or being submissive...whatever. I dont even care what others think. As long as you are happy and content with yourself there isnt an issue about what others percieve you as being or not being.Ive been fortunate enough have above decent experiences and havent faced much racial scrutiny.,gaysian,cu9k0ap,2,t5_2tg5w

6722895,0,t1_d0eeg7s,You have obviously havent met a lot of Asians. Plenty of Asian men have angular faces. There are plenty of Bollywood leading men that have angular faces.And of course races have a certain set of physical features there are exceptions and variations of course but theres still a general look.You can also do a study on college degrees correlated to race and find that the percentage of African Americans with a college degree is lower than the percentage of Asians with a college degree. For example  of African Americans hold a college degree or higher in West Virginia in  vs  of Asians in West Virginia but no HR manager would ever say no African Americans or Asians only on a job listing if the job requirement is a college degree. Lumping all Asian people into a singular physical look is racist because you are defining someone by their race rather than their individual characteristics.  Saying it is okay to use race as definition for physical features is just as racist as using race as a definition for mental features.,gaysian,d0epetg,1,t5_2tg5w

I agree with this. You can happen to get a date randomly without being emotionally mature but chances of it going much beyond that diminish if you dont have the emotional experiencestability required for a lasting relationship. If youre not able to understand someone on an emotional level youre not going to be able to do much with them besides enjoy their physical company which does not make for a very tight bond between people.,gaysian,d21nd5l,3,t5_2tg5w
