215766,0,t1_cewso2t,Thank you! Normally i would have lit that but it was a dance studio and they barely let me do the staff at all a guy lost control of his earlier in the night and almost hit the mirrors. Im definitely trying to work on the ending though. You cant see it from the video but the crowd is actually a semi circle going right up to the walls i had to stand pretty far back so everybody could see me and not just those in the center. Ill definitely stand closer when the audience is directly in front though. What would you suggest character wise if im going for a Brianna Belladonna vibe? Funny and some times sexy a little over the top and raunchy at times. Mostly just a caricature of myself really. I like to make people laugh and be uncomfortable better at being sweet then the sex pot thing if it happens its usually an accident. Working on character persona and stage name have always been my weakest point.  Thank you for the reminder not to apologize for being there. The rest of the acts were pretty acts silks and belly dance mostly so I guess I was a little nervous being in the line up with them.Thank you so much for all of your advice ill definitely keep it in mind for my next time up!,circus,cf30qly,1,t5_2qnow
1113175,0,t3_26t8yz,Disclaimer I do circus stuff for fun in a country that has no circus history. At all. This is a different perspective than what you ask for but I hope its helpful.gt Is working for the circus as glamorous as I imagine it to be?Hahahahahaha Good one.. Unless by as glamorous you mean traveling hippies then yesAnd please dont be discouraged by this instead of glamour you have an awesome global community of incredible dedicated and talented artistsgt Whats your job?Corporate IT. In the circus Im a teacher and juggler.gt How did you get into the business?A friend showed me how to spin poi. I never let go of them Later I found other like minded individuals that were interested more in educating the public and refining their art than in making eye candy shows and we founded a juggling group that later grew into a small circus school.gt Whats the pay like?Miserable but its mostly because of my country. You will get rich in spirit not money.. But you can live off of circusperforming arts if you are really good and put some effort into it.gt Do you have any advice for someone wanting to get a job working for the circus? There is so much more to circus than just the traveling circus. You can join a local firejuggling group and do performances for example. Teach at a circus school or do workshops for children and even adults.What relevant skills do you have? We might be able to advise you better if we knew..,circus,chutrgf,1,t5_2qnow
1187280,0,t3_27phf0,I work there currently on ring crew. I love it however it is not for everyone. Its very hard work and you will be yelled at. You need to be ok with working in the blistering heat and the freezing cold. You will be lifting and moving very heavy things. You will climb up the masts to the very top of the tent. When it snows you will be shoveling snow off the tent all night.  It is hard for most workers to become friends with performers. That being said im friends with a lot of performers and ive trained with a lot of them. Its a great way to learn and to get a feel for circus. Its a very accepting community and you can learn a lot. On tent crew you would be living in a triple which is a room about the size of a walk in closet that you share with  other people. If you want i can put up some pictures. Joining was one of the best decisions I ever made. It is hard exhausting work and you will be pushed to your limit. Ive been close to quitting many times and every time im glad i pushed through and stayed. its not for everyone but its worth a try.If you have any other questions feel free to ask.,circus,ci36rr7,2,t5_2qnow
3152365,0,t1_coopv7s,Shes manipulating an object its object manipulation. As I mentioned before its really not that complicated and neither your negativity nor you low opinion of her abilities somehow magically change what she is doing into something else. ,circus,cooqnsz,2,t5_2qnow
7475530,0,t3_4hpv7f,Definitely TSNY.  Its a  min walk from the Navy yards metro so very accessible from Rockville that way although its a long ride.They dont have the space for German wheel but there are probably  static classes a half dozen partner acro and a couple of handstand classes a week. I do doubles static and acro  very good instructors. Its not cheap though a  minute  person class is   with a multi card.  They usually run a point for every  students so you get a lot of bar time.  ,circus,d2rxaln,2,t5_2qnow
8667099,0,t3_4ueexb,Id get into NECCAs intensive program.  Its brutal and will get you in the habit of training hard enough and well enough that any other training you pursue youll get a lot more out of.  I see a lot of aerialists who are selftrained or just more casually trained than is really appropriate in the circus and the lack of a really solid foundation limits their ability.  If you want to do it right train with people who know what right is.  Training by yourself or with more casual teachers wont get you to the same level.  Disclaimer  I work at NECCA but not as a coach.,circus,d6p09me,3,t5_2qnow
