7231280,0,t3_4edmcg,Jacksonville residents have over the years gotten a bit of a reputation for premature complaining. Lol. I feel as if this is true. Im a transplant but Ive noticed in my  short years here that when new development is going on there is a ton of push back from the residents. Rightly so the Beaches are gems hidden in Jacksonville. But the mindset I feel as if is a bit traditional and stuck in the old days. I had no idea Gate was from Jax. This kinda of changes my stance on the issue. AB is the oldest of the  beaches so Im not surprised they put up this fight. ,JacksonvilleFla,d20564e,2,t5_2xwxh
