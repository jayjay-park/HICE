517042,0,t3_200dee,I ran it in . Not sure if its changed much since then but heres my topofmind take.... Prerace  Fairly well organized not too crowded. Number pickup wasnt bad a day or two before. Most people hang out on the Tsongas Arena concourse so youll end up with some bathroom lines as with pretty much every big race ever this was the main annoyance.. Race  A couple minute walk over to the start line pretty casual and didnt have to deal with nudging people to get some personal spacelast second stretchingtie shoes. Theres a half marathon at the same time but the marathon course is one big loop out then you come halfway back loop out again then bring it home into Lowell. Its very flat so a great course for a PR although too late to qualify for Boston the next year. Decent crowd at some points along the way although towards the end the crowd died off. There are a bunch of water stops manned by local high school kids one of them has Gu youll run by it twice via the loop. Running across the bridge at the end is great. Overall Id recommend finding and sticking with a pack since the field isnt very crowded.Spots to note on the course  Around miles  the road is banked slightly down and to the right doesnt feel great on the knees and you have to cover it twice. Miles  and  where the loop ends are across a big somewhat bouncy bridge  dont look down if youre afraid of heights. There are a couple rolling hills towards the end nothing bad at all. . PostRace Standard fare  some food soup. If you finish early you can probably escape via the parking garage without too much trouble but I bet once the finish area gets more crowded theres a bit of a wait granted the race isnt too crowded to begin with.tldr Well organized not insanely crowded. Very flat course easy PR. Couple loops so you have a good idea of where you are. Too late in the year to qualify for Boston the following year but if youre already into Boston then you can use Baystate to improve your seeding.,Boston_Running,cfz1i6n,3,t5_2smw6
