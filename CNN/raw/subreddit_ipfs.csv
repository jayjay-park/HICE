5507967,0,t1_cwfoven,It was a little careless of me to request the sub without properly checking who you were so sorry about that gtgtI just thought I would improve some of the parts like filling out the sidebar. I almost always have a reddit tab open so any spam or reports will hit me quickly,ipfs,cwfoytf,2,t5_34dae

6970438,0,t1_d16f3ri,Well I guess if you know the original hash you could tell if another version has been modified from it but there is no real way to prove if a photo came from the camera with that hash.There already exists forensic cameras that sign photos when they are taken but like we have seen with game consoles its only a matter of time before someone extracts the key from the device.Hashes have been around for a long time. They werent invented with ipfs. If a good system for telling fake images from real with hashes existed we probably would have thought about it by now,ipfs,d16fph7,1,t5_34dae
7275308,0,t3_4eyc3v,Do you have any kind of directory of videos in the works?Ive been working on a plugin for kodiosmc that redirects to a local instance of ipfs. I think it would be cool to access this site from inside the media player.,ipfs,d255jky,2,t5_34dae
8315354,0,t3_4rgycz,May be a naive question but where exactly are these files stored when put onto IPFS? on everyones machines ? does that mean if a machine is down then that particular portion of video will be lost  correct?,ipfs,d5gz4ur,3,t5_34dae
8623577,0,t1_d6jjq6y,no you can try it though its still lacking query functionality afaik  last time i looked which is of course essential for a database,ipfs,d6jjrs2,2,t5_34dae
9428252,0,t1_d9avuu1,gtMinor petty nitpicking ideally ipfshash would be used instead of ipfshash in order to mimic nix filesystems.No. Because if you rely on browser integration you need to specify a protocol since HTTPS no longer works we need something else.ipfshash is ambigous for a webbrowser. Which protocol? File? FTP? HTTP? what domain? Is it localhost or maybe related to the current site? Absolute links usually refer to the current domain but we dont have that... A webbrowser needs information not only where stuff is but also how to access it.When youre on the web you cant have a nix filepath you need a uniform resource identifier which has been thoroughly specified on RFC specifically page  for the schemeIt might also be worthy to note that if the ISPs or the government decided to ban the web they could simply ban all other protocols too so its pretty reasonable to assume that IPFS would be blocked fast.,ipfs,d9b3gj4,3,t5_34dae

11651375,0,t1_dggl295,Regd your edit Were you not calling ipfs.files.cat after the ready event was triggered before? Did that work in some other browser than Firefox? I wonder how that could work Perhaps the node starts up so fast that by the time cat is called synchronously the asynchronous init has already finished?,ipfs,dggp4i7,1,t5_34dae
