334862,0,t3_1xx1fm,Please remember that there are voices saying that bter currently have problems with updating their client. This could lead to fork and problems with your coins. Im not saying that bter is bad they just need to learn that NXT is rapidly developing and they need to put attention every day to any client updates,NXT,cffh8qq,2,t5_2r5j7

397818,0,t3_1xsf9t,Testing!  NXT interests me greatly.  Would love to see this really take off.  I dont think any crypto that has a  minute verification like bitcoin just has any chance in the future.  ,NXT,cflzzxs,1,t5_2r5j7

502763,0,t3_1zdh6i,So Im looking at my client noticing that some rich ahole is forging almost every block! Within a  minute period!! Greeeeaaaat,NXT,cfxf1k0,1,t5_2r5j7
567841,0,t1_cg4suhh,Khh lol.I wonder why humanity has this tendency to try and fix things by making them worse. DDiminishing money supply  growing economy  recipe for disaster. Im starting to question the purity of the goals behind NXT.And forging is still quite confusing as nothing is actually created which is well what forging would normally mean. Maybe collecting,NXT,cg4thk7,0,t5_2r5j7
577029,0,t3_20ov7s,Well Im hitting blocks but keep in mind that just over  of those blocks actually have transaction fees.In the past couple of days Ive only made  Nxt on forging.,NXT,cg5v2at,1,t5_2r5j7

969333,0,t3_256odk,That thing with the multipool was very unfortunate. I suggest to mine on another multipool and convert the earned coins on an exchange by yourself. But there is hope that soon will come a new old multipool nxtpl.org. I can understand that this is frustrating it was for me too. But giving up on NXT makes no sense. NXT will be successful anyway also without a multipool. ,NXT,cheh17f,1,t5_2r5j7
1156000,0,t1_chzmd1o,Please enlighten us as to how a handful of centralized multimillion dollar mining conglomerates inflating and liquidating the currency by double digits is a better system. If youre complaining about the initial distribution I guarantee you that your CPU x graphics card or your antiquated ASIC device running on residential power would not have distributed the coin to more of us average Joes than the two month open IPO that Nxt had. If anything miners usually dump everything they mine and couldnt care less about securing the coin since they can easily switch to the next best SHA coin on the market if things go south.,NXT,chznzvz,7,t5_2r5j7

1564621,0,t1_cjcdtms,no...the multi gateway extension seeing as its hosted on a completely different domain from nxt.org youd expect them to provide a link to it...,NXT,cjceccf,1,t5_2r5j7
2605627,0,t3_2pp2r3,I like the closure There exists a world outside of todays monetary system that is more efficient affordable and easier to use than todays alternatives. Welcome to the new world of free trade were only getting started.,NXT,cmyoyec,1,t5_2r5j7
2709046,0,t3_2qwd5v,Very interesting project looking forward to your reviews of other . platforms! There certainly is lots to cover.Id like to address the point made about James threatening to drop MGW test servers. Reading into the thread a little bit further reveals that it was not in the best interest of the SuperNET or investors for him to spent his time doing server maintenance.The community was not stepping up until that point. Afterwards many hands have emerged and now MGW is mostly run by other community members.I tried to do this subject justice here. James is also actively developing MGW to this day working on DB MGW another of those acronyms that basically means a faster more reliable Multigateway.I also want to caution you against using the word cult. If James has a cult following the same Im afraid could be said of Vitalik or even Satoshi.Though there may be truth to there being blind followers to any of the great people in the world that hardly is a reflection of these great people.I personally dont think any of the people I mentioned have anything to do with cult behaviour. Throwing that word around poisons the water.I disagree with the need for identity verification. Lots of criminals and scammers walking around with their names well known It makes little difference in out modern justice system.Im a lead contributor to the SuperNET wiki and am actively researching the SuperNET and adding content to wiki.supernet.org. I invite you to contact me if you have any questions that I may aid in.I also appreciate the suggestions on how to make the SuperNET more transparent I will consider those further and try to bring further clarity to the project.Ill end with a concern some NXT community members have raised being that this NXT report spends the large majority of its content focused on the work of James while neglecting much of the development happening on NXT alone.Perhaps a part  is in order?Best regards and over all good work. This is an excellent overview of the SuperNET and allot of the stuff being built ontop of NXT.Happy new year!Juan S. Galt.,NXT,cnc0ahc,2,t5_2r5j7
