2531900,0,t3_2ooent,Glad they are taking their time this release to make sure things are stable especially after the last few releases.  Id much rather have something stable than something sooner.  I also definitely appreciate the honesty from Ethrel in all of his posts.,TimberAndStone,cmp20lv,6,t5_2vbl6
2987606,0,t1_co7m6ti,I didnt have any problem with the maintain in inventory option the only thing is that masons craft bricks very slowly for me but I dont think that has anything to do with your problem.Maybe theres something special about your save that makes it bug out? Post it in the forum maybe they can help you,TimberAndStone,co7nuuw,2,t5_2vbl6
5463972,0,t3_3pwepa,Fairly slow paced game but is very challenging. You control and design every aspect of your settlement with blocks. Id say your defence is more challenging than anything else. Enemies can be very tough.,TimberAndStone,cwa2o2p,3,t5_2vbl6
5488176,0,t3_3q95y8,Im afraid I dont have a solution although Im pretty sure you had to tell villagers to attack rather than they do it themselves.Anyway I wanted to be your first reply so hello!! ,TimberAndStone,cwd5y7d,5,t5_2vbl6
5569415,0,t1_cwn5p0h,Masons dont smelt ore so theyre not stealing the xp from your Blacksmiths.  You can leave your forge set to allow both to use it setting a forge to allow only one or the other seems to be for aesthetic purposes  like if you wanted a mason crafting area and a blacksmith crafting area and didnt want your units pathing between the two areas.,TimberAndStone,cwnfqnn,3,t5_2vbl6
5579994,0,t3_3ri3wv,Im on day  with  units been losing people due to bad gate defense. So Ive shut down one of my gates and Im revamping my primary gate faces the most of the empty map. I just finished upgrading my vegetable farm from about a x area to x area that now includes Cotton Flax and Wheat. I am about to upgrade my tiny x warehouse to something around x not sure of the dimensions yet. I also am finally paving the roads and have plans to set up a small housing district with the roofs supporting a small park. I also need to build a keep with attached training grounds I wish we had a military hall that was separate from the regular hall and barracks to accommodate my currently small army of  archers and  infantry. I do have about  Lv  archers but they are leftover from when I couldnt specialize because I had too few people. I also lost my  blacksmith because he had to help in an earlier defense which set me back by about  weeks ingame. Storage is red because of Wheat... I dont care about it enough to have my OCD pick a spot for it to be yet.ImgurSuggestions are welcome but dont be too specific. Id like to maintain my own creativity as much as possible.I love this game. Keep up the great work. ,TimberAndStone,cwor0j3,4,t5_2vbl6
