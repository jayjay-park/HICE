583356,0,t3_20jcow,I just came across this article about the Santa Maria PhilharmonicThough I will say Im ignorant to band  music ensembles and dont know if they would use a trombone!Going out at night is fine as long as you arent wandering around certain neighborhoods. Particular the North West part of town. I wouldnt recommend going to Louie Bs either people get stabbed there pretty frequently. Rooneys always has a group of police waiting outside of the parking lot and front door area too and its a much nicer part of town. I havent really been to any other bars in town to say what else is decent though.SLO Bars arent all that bad but it is mostly college kids. Most of them are more focused on the dancing and music then they are an actual bar setting but I was hammered when Ive been up there and my memory might be fuzzy.There is a small EDM scene I believe. I keep getting Event Requests on Facebook for them. From the pictures Ive seen they havent been that popular though. Big event centers that only have small groups of people but there is a DJ and lights and Im assuming EDM music.This Facebook page  DJ is the one that seems to be behind most of these events in town,SantaMaria,cg6kygt,1,t5_2s5hx

6767795,0,t1_d0deqon,out of about  visits la picosita has been perfectly fine for about  of those.  Of those  times maybe  were due to late night partying and wanting something other than Jacks or King Falafel.  Their nachos tend to be awesome... might need to order in Spanish because most of the less good experiences there seem to be due to communication barriers.,SantaMaria,d0jerby,1,t5_2s5hx
8995347,0,t3_53dy0j,There is some. Leisure Time hosts a games day every quarter or so. There was a weekly game meetup that has lost attendance recently due partly to life events and organization issues. There is also regular gaming cons at Cal Poly. We do have a FB group so PM me and I can get you added.,SantaMaria,d7t3nr7,3,t5_2s5hx
