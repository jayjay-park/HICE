1658268,0,t3_2dafmc,I have a few traditions like decorating the first weekend of December and leaving all of my wrapping until the nd and just spend the whole day at home alone watching movies and wrapping. I love just being at home or at familys homes just relaxing looking at the tree eating and drinking whatever I want. I always loved going shopping and looking at all the Christmas displays but this year my boyfriend and I moved to a very small rural northern community for work and the closest shopping centre is a hr train ride away or an  plan ride so it looks like online shopping will be our only resource this year. It will be strange as this is our first Christmas away from Newfoundland but my sister and her boyfriend live here too so we will make our own traditions this year  I just love everything about Christmas and the season. The lights decorations food and family. As well as being a Christian its a pretty big deal all around  ,christmas,cjo6rif,2,t5_2qi2n

But good for you if you wanna celebrate it earlier in fact I wish I could hahaAlso the whole holiday season thing. I literally thought of that idea a few weeks ago before I saw this post and I thought it was the greatest thing Ive ever come up with. I already treat halloween as a month long thing I already spend most of november stretching out my stomach ie gorging myself in food in preparation for thanksgiving and I already spend the time immediately following thanksgiving surrounding myself in christmas joy. So why not treat it as one continuous threemonth long celebration? And you know what to ease the postchristmas blues Id even throw in the superbowl at the end as part of the celebration.Someone should make a subreddit about this if there isnt one already.,christmas,csdkaa3,2,t5_2qi2n

Im on here in august though because I recently accidentally heard a christmas song and I started getting really into it. I dont wanna watch any specials or listen to any songs because I know itll be all the better if I wait until thanksgiving ends so Ive been lurking in here for a little bit to placate myself. But hey if you guys have no qualms about getting into the spirit early go right ahead! I wish I could but I dont wanna risk christmas losing its magic for me xAnd my favorite christmas song is Rockin Around the Christmas Tree. Its just a perfect classic song in my opinion. I cant wait to listen to it next christmas. Special mention goes to Santa Baby which was my third grade teachers favorite song. She played it so many times for us that christmas that even though I dont like it it leaves me hopelessly lost in a wave of nostalgia every time I hear it nowadays.,christmas,cu4q0n7,3,t5_2qi2n

8599477,0,t1_d6giato,Food safe plastics are usually relating to longterm storage of acidic liquids or containers that will be heated in the presence of food. In the cases of acidic liquids nonfood safe plastics may leech a small amount of undesirable chemicals over a long period of time. Same with when you heat a nonfood safe plastic you can leech some things out through the heating process. Regardless you are storing neither an acidic liquid nor are you heating the ingredients in the ornament bulb. Therefore there is exactly zero reason to worry about obtaining foodsafe containers. The only thing you must do is wash them as there are usually residues left over from the manufacturing process on plastics or glass that are not intended for food. They are just not washed at the factory because they do not expect them to come into contact with food. No problem though just wash them yourself with warm soapy water and you are good to go.Source Im a polymer chemist,christmas,d6gizx8,3,t5_2qi2n

9327648,0,t1_d8y6pwm,My grandmother used to cook twice once for Christmas Eve and once for Christmas Day I guess as she got older she decided just one meal was best so we went to this place not too far from my grandparents that hashad a daily menu place where that day you got that meal only its soul food Cornbread a meat like pork chops or chicken green beans collards mashed potatoes that type of stuff you could go in and buy a plate so long as it fit in the box and the box closed properly you could fill the plates up I think it closed because more recently we just go to either a Shanes Rib Shack or a BBQ Place and get a couple of pounds of bbq and some sides.Weve also been known to hit Panda Express Zaxbys or some other faster food type place too but we try and keep to homier type takeout over fast food or delivery stuff Its nice to have that and then on Christmas have the honey ham turkey pudding and other stuff but honestly Id much rather we just had the Turkey on Christmas Eve and the Honey Ham on Christmas Day.  As for the radio it was really weird the first time Id never seen something like that tune to . or something and it was Christmas music. It cuts out almost as soon as you get to the end of the neighboring yard.

10412337,0,t3_5oqxkp,Im still due to have my big ChristmasNew Year dinner with my friends. I like to do it every year after everyone else has done celebrating. Maybe next weekend. A big turkey all the trimmings and we tell fortunes afterwards when were tipsy. Sometimes we get organised and do a white elephant gift exchange for stuff we got and didnt want for Christmas. PostChristmas dinner. Might work for you?,christmas,dcob11n,1,t5_2qi2n
