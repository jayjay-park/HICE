I dont know what your company policy is but Ive found that Sirmadam I need to ask you to stop swearing and be mindful of the tone of language youre using towards me  I am trying to help but its made very difficult when youre behaving in this manner.  doing this often makes the customer realise that theyre behaving like a child and they often calm down. If they dont stop something like Ive advised you once to mind your tone with me. I refuse to help you if youre being rude. One more instance and I WILL end the call.

1331493,0,t3_29br7q,Ive done outbound and inbound sales both warm and hot Ive also done  on  coaching with people to learn to sell. Firstly you want to sound confident but not cocky. Feel free to meander a bit into conversation once the customer views you as a person not a robot they find it much harder to say no or hang up and be rude. Keep up the energy! Obviously it depends on the office but generally outbound sales departments are active lots of people standing walking waving their hands. Theres a reason for this the physical action keeps you mentally active which translates into your voice. If youre acting happy and upbeat eventually youll feel that way even on  a bad day and customers WILL pick up if youre not smiling and happy. Give yourself a cheer or something every sale you get some centres will have something set for this we had a bell you had to ring and everyone else would cheer if you have something like this USE IT its kind of addictive. Do NOT let people get to you. Even getting a sale an hour you will get a lot of people hanging up on you getting angry or being a dick. Just let it wash over you dont get hung up or dwell on it as soon as the call is over its done forget it. Remember that the target is an average. You may well go half a day without a sale then get  in a row.  Sometimes its just luck of the draw not everybody can be sold so a bad day should not be something to get you down.   Overcoming objectives is something that depends on your call style and also what youre selling. If you can give me a rough idea of your style when you were doing appointments and what youre selling Ill happily give you some tips ,talesfromcallcenters,cijerhi,5,t5_2urem

Using a credit card for larger payments is far better as credit card gives more protection. If company has external webisite that takes credit card payments direct I use that method instead.
