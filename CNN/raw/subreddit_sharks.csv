3587427,0,t1_cq16gs0,Blacktips are like a pack of dogs really inquisitive and some get cheeky but theyre by no means aggressive. when you spend enough time with them on any given dive you eventually start seeing different personalities its fascinating. Where Im from we have tons of raggies so I dont even count them as real sharks anymore but if I see a shark on a dive its guaranteed to be a bunch of them. I had a bull follow our boat and swam off as soon as we  did our entry rolls. Other than that Ive only ever seen  tiger. She was around .m and just passed me without much notice...it was rather humbling. I was dying to see oceanic white tips when I dived in the redsea but in  dives including night dives we didnt encounter a single shark quite sad if you think about it...although I trust them about as much as I trust bullszambies. ,sharks,cq170li,2,t5_2rg5r
