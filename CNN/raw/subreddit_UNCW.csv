4094208,0,t3_36nuyv,Dont go to Quad. The place went from a party scene then the staff worked on calming that this last year it was nice and quiet but recently crime has been ravaging Quad. Theres been a lot of robberies armed at that domestic violence issues destruction of property etc.Seahawk Landing is decent but its had some issues as well and its rather hard to get to. Cove has had a LOT of issues plumbing blowing apart bad management poor maintenence a few vehicles have been stolen and theres been some issues with parties there.Oncampus is alright but incrediably expensive and gets rather roudy at times. Progress and Lighthouse have turned into party areas. The Reserve isnt bad.Best bet is UNCW has a roomate system cant remember the link Ill leave him to search for that. That allows you to find roomates who are either looking for a place as well or find someone who has a place already. Try to aim for a place off Wrightsville any road that goes N off Wrightsville Ave. or by RacineCardinal. Theres quite a few houses there for relatively cheap like month with  bed  bath and its easy to find a roomate. Living in a house is also x better for both studying along with comfort of living theres also a lot of other apartment complexes around that are possibilities as well.,UNCW,crmyr65,2,t5_2saw2
5945287,0,t1_cxyxzd5,I beg to differ about the stereotypical frat bro. I was at PITT in Greenvile for two years before transferring to UNCW. I can tell you that ECU and that city in general is where the frat bro and basic white chick foster. UNCW doesnt have anything in comparison to that.I would say UNCW has the average  population of that type in comparison to any other college. I feel like theres a decent amount of progressive students in the population as well.I completely agree about administration though its complete shit. Couple that with the CIT program thats only two years old  its been a bit of nowin situation for myself. The majority of the courses are guinea pig classes this is no secret as most of the professors have told us this word for word.,UNCW,cxyygwy,7,t5_2saw2
6927440,0,t1_d11hx4f,I was under the impression that the party scene at wilmington wasnt too great its not like its ECU or anything. Thats one of the main reasons Im choosing to attend.,UNCW,d11jtwp,2,t5_2saw2
6930219,0,t1_d11jtwp,ECU definitely was a party school but lets be honest. Its in Greenville and that place sucks. Wilmington is a much better place to live while going to school. ,UNCW,d11v64l,1,t5_2saw2
7040438,0,t3_4c1ch7,Honors is real fun you get real close with the people living in the hall with you. Everyone still gets drunks smokes weed and all that good stuff so youll be able to have your fair share of fun. Im about to be a senior and Im no longer in honors but being in honors your first two years is clutch cause you get to register early. Besides the living and the early registration honors really is just if you wanna be an over achiever but being in it your first year will change your experience at the dub,UNCW,d1ee2f6,2,t5_2saw2
7364963,0,t1_d2fbq0j,Thankfully I got my NC license back in  before I had even thought about seeking residency. The last time I was claimed was in  but yes they are in a different state. What did you provide as far as tax records? Will simply providing W statements be enough?,UNCW,d2fcg9t,1,t5_2saw2

10400840,0,t3_5oy7jg,Im guessing you moved to North Carolina specially for college correct? From what I understand it is much harder in that situation.Use this site as a guide if you arent already If you havent done them already do all of the major things you would do when moving to a new stateRegistering car in state getting ID changing your address with the IRS to your NC address etc....It sounds like you might have done many of these things but do everything you can if you are serious about staying. Living in NC during the time you are not at school can show that you are also not only living there for college. It does happen but they are going to be strict on what counts so they are not giving every juniorsenior instate tuition.,UNCW,dcn02uo,1,t5_2saw2
