Meaning us  stars earn hp a bit slower opening them up now may risk in getting a high level cover and no slot available for it. At least this is me speaking from a personal extensive experience had to lose  black panther and  iron fist cover like that.

Also the required matches are not needed to unlock the next event. Get as far as you can without the required matches then go back and play them for the points and rewards.

7960501,0,t1_d4ah0k5,I just made a comment about this but Ill address it here too because it needs to be said.gt All the non shield players in pvp will suffer from higher frequency of attacks.First things first if you are a non shield PvP player youre going to have a bad time unless youre also a megawhale. If you want more points you shield and hop thats just how the format works. Second of all youre ignoring the fact that people who do hop do so on a schedule that wont be changing shield recharge timers and that those people are primarily riding cupcake trains once they start shielding.gt PVE will even be more grinding.In the current PvE format I regularly take T when I want and sometimes Ill go for TT if I only need a certain  cover. The amount of healthpacks I spend at the end of a sub varies but I usually end with at least . In the event I need to grind harder new character releases andor events like sim I crack taco tokens to get more health packs. So as someone who has been hardcore grinding PvE for a long time now let me tell you characters health recharging  faster will have virtually no impact on how much grinding it takes to place well. The most significant factor that affects grinding has never been how quickly your characters heal its how fast you can clear nodes how late you can start your grind.There are valid complaints to make about the VIP system but claiming that its going to make PvP and PvE worse for people who dont subscribe is completely ridiculous.,MarvelPuzzleQuest,d4au372,1,t5_2zkzj

8275340,0,t3_4ssbzf,A few times. I used to play a few mobile games. But stopped all of them last summer. MPQ got back in the line up because of low time commitment. Then there were big events that were fun. If you dont attack at all in a season until about half way through your group will be small and filled with new people so its easy to get more  packs. I discovered this on my first season when I got  which really helped back then. Even the  stars were awesome for me. So that might make it more fun and give you a break.Other than that Id suggest taking a break for a while and coming back only if you want to if you ever get bored. Itll be kind of fun again maybe.Endless games are easy to burn out on. Thats why console games books and movies are so good. They end and you move on. ,MarvelPuzzleQuest,d5bz5ei,1,t5_2zkzj

8539921,0,t3_4wqgky,gt I did get a  but sold it as it pushed me too high in the groupings so wasnt worth it.Stop opening LTs until youve got some s championed.  None of your s are going to be useful any time soon so theres no harm in holding onto the tokens and having to sell a  is something youre definitely going to regret down the line.OBW and Luke Cage are definitely worth rostering.  Shes useful well into  territory and hes one of the stronger s in the game.  Drop Ragnarok and Spiderman if you need the slots.Also stop opening tokens altogether unless you have enough HP to buy a new roster slot.  When you have enough for a new roster slot open tokens starting from the bottom up common gt heroic gt event specific until you do get a new hero then hold onto the rest of your tokens until you get enough HP for another slot.  Its delayed gratification but its the best way to ensure that you arent wasting good covers.  Even doing this hold off on opening the LTs until youve got championed s.In terms of overall focus Id work on rostering and championing pretty much all the s for the rewards and continuing to build your  roster.  Also it doesnt make too much difference because the early levels are so cheap but Id stop putting ISO into your s.

Particularly for abilities where all it does is heal a character Im looking at you Wolverine  and  star.  Fix the few bugs still out there where damage and abilities dont match up right still looks funky on some powers. Add more  Star rewards to the game. People who rank in the top  usually get at least   star cover add the  star covers you would have gotten if ranked below that to the  star cover reward from higher up tiers. Add a DDQ  Star Version. We have enough  Stars in the game now I think  or something and its time to start getting a cover a day just like the  star but only if you already have that four star just like the  star DDQ works now. It would not break the game at all because everyone is still gated by ISO and RNG.If they added these things to the game I could see myself playing this game for at least another  years on top of the  years Ive already put in.,MarvelPuzzleQuest,d6igwco,3,t5_2zkzj
8627881,0,t3_4xy3ps,One thing I learned is not to be too heartbroken about having to sell some  covers.

8699055,0,t3_4z20p1,How much time do you want to spend in your  transition?If youre okay with  months with using  mostly then just grind DDQ and do PvE. Save up your CP until you have a solid  roster and then work on your  transition.I get bored if I dont feel like Im progressing so I used my CP to cover out the top  s. Id rather enjoy the  gameplay and transition slower into  than to slog through all the PvE events and DDQs saving up CP and hoping I get what I need. The variety in  land is severely lacking with  useablegood characters many of them with the exception of Magneto and Storm are quite vanilla.  characters have much more variety and possible combos so I wanted to be in  land as soon as possible. Unfortunately many  characters need max or near max covers to be enjoyed so I had to make that investmentDoing every event and prioritizing the best charsteams means you can play with a solid  roster in  months IF you use CP to complete characters.The question is how patient are you and how invested do you see yourself in the longterm? the    transition for most free players will take about a year if not longer. If you dont see yourself aiming for that goal then use CP on s.You dont need to spend money just make sure to do all the PvEs and hit the end of progression for each. ,MarvelPuzzleQuest,d6t0i4m,1,t5_2zkzj

Good. He can beat the first mission in DDQ by himself. So can Juggernaut. Most people prefer Juggernaut but you only need a single  and it should be one of those two.Some of the missions in the prologue can net you HP other than that you pretty much want to hit  in every pvp unlikely I realize you can and try to push as far as possible in PvE to get hp that way. All this said sell Phoenix. Shes killing you. You have a person roster and she is raising your scaling roughly  levels. Its going to hurt but she is killing you. Aside from that dont level your strongest people. If you look at my roster youll see I have  covers for  Ironman and hes still level . You want to focus on getting a solid  team I would suggest rostering  magneto and  black widow when you can and getting  champions. Then focus on .

8967301,0,t1_d7p5ca8,Im not sure why youre getting downvoted so heavily for this I do think its fair and its very straightforward in addressing why you might have jumped the gun a bit.  You seem like a standup guy and I understand where youre coming from but Im afraid I just cant agree with you on this even from a regular user level.  And its not because Im a fan of the namewhile I understand the silly fun in it it still strikes me as kind of lowbrow.  I got nothing against lowbrow but its just not the way I go.  The reason I cant get behind what youre saying is that the kind of attitude attached to the nickname is  fostered by the game itself and Boobstone is actually a fairly tame example of it.  Its something I wouldnt be surprised to see Deadpool say ingame.  Even Tits McGee feels perfectly inline with the Deadpool character depending on which version of the character were going with.Theres no way to shelter your kids from that sort of thing.  Lets use a nonMPQ example for a sec.  Lets say a kidnot even your kidwatches Family Guy.  Hes going to learn a lot worse than Boobstone.  Now that kids little brother is going to learn Family Guy humor and that guys little brother is in your yearolds first grade class and she picks it up that way.  And thats just using a TV show as an example.  Youre talking about reducing language to beneath that threshold on the internet.  If your yearold is on the internet where the offending material is posted in this case the kinds of language and ideas he or she would be exposed to is far beyond Family Guy humor much less Boobstone humor.  If your yearoldor rather anyones kid for that matteris browsing the internet looking for MPQrelated info theres a certain threshold you could reasonably expect.  For example if someone were posting pornographic fanart of the characters absolutely Id see a logical point to draw the line.  If someone were making openly lewd comments about a character thats getting into rough territory too.  Even excessive sexual objectification of characters would be toeing the line.  But when this is official ingame art and something you can find just by browsing the wiki then I think thats a pretty reasonable threshold of objectification to keep in mind when referencing comments and nicknames that call attention to her breasts are not nearly doing so to the degree that the game itself does.  The kind of objectification youd get from Boobstone and even Tits McGee is frankly well within the bounds of what the game itself does with this character.  And I  agree you should be very aware and careful of how your children are exposed to that kind of attitude but I dont think its reasonable to expect players of a game to show a more restrained attitude toward the characters than the game itself does.  If your children are playing the game and being exposed to this thats fineno judgment at all from mebut the playerbase using suggestive nicknames is well beyond what youre granting your children access to just by playing the game.  ,MarvelPuzzleQuest,d7pqfva,1,t5_2zkzj

9971052,0,t1_db771yy,gtWhy would highlevel highstar characters make things more difficult?Scaling in PvE concerns how many levels the enemies gain between each clear of each nodefight.To set your scaling the game averages the levels of your three highestleveled characters.  The scaling is set such that if you use your best characters the sixth clear of a node will be just about all your guys can handle.Since I cant see your roster lets say your three best characters are levels   and .  The average used to set your scaling will be  and the sixth clear of the node should be beatable by a level  team.Now lets introduce a star into the mix.  Now the levels being averaged are   and  assuming you didnt automatically level the star to level .  Now your average is .  Now the enemies in the later nodes are a lot more than your low characters can handle and if you got a dog of a star that cant carry the team youre in for some difficulty as you try to progress.edit  In PvP theyre bad because a onecover star marks you as an easy target.

9975647,0,t1_db6460a,Thats not how the mobile gaming industry actually works. Their key metric is average revenue per player per day. The goal is a playerday average although if its virtually unheard of at least as of a year ago for games to even get close to that as a running average. There is a ton of upfront cost and overhead in maintaining a game like this. As such the people who have invested that money expect to see a commensurate return on investment. If they dont get that they simply move their money elsewhere and the game gets shut down.Whales are the players who keep the doors open and the game online for the other tens of thousands of players who dont pay a dime. Compared to most games this game is quite inexpensive and it certainly doesnt require a player to pay one cent to succeed in the game. Im at just over  days of play with a nearly full   roster that rocks. Ive only spent  four times during sales just because I wanted to support the devs. We can get away with that because the whales are pouring cash into the system. I appreciate that D and everyone else involved pulled together such a great game.

Just because they arent visible it doesnt mean they still dont have a physical presence. For example Invisible Woman might be invisible and standing in front of you. If you swing a sword where she is its still going to to hit her whether or not you know shes there. Its not going to just magically pass right through her. Same goes for a unidirectional fire blast or a spray of bullets.,MarvelPuzzleQuest,dccxj8g,22,t5_2zkzj
10344253,0,t1_dcfx898,A couple things If lots of high level players are finding you to beat on youre doing well in PvP. If you are shielding maybe itd be worth it to stop. Get as high as you can and then walk away and dont stress over the hits. Every loss will lower your MMR which will make you harder to find. If you want placement rewards youre at the stage where you should disregard everything I said about climbing and just latestart events. Figure out how long it takes you to burn through all your heal packs and start events with that much time remaining. If youre lucky youll get a fresh time slice with players less determined to rush to the top. Its risky you might get a slice that opened a day ago with  people a long way ahead of you but sometimes the risk pays off.The last  hours of an event bring the heaviest action Essentially you either dont want to play during the last  hours with a shield on or be fighting upstream until the last second. With no usable stars I think right now just dont worry about getting high scores. Do SHIELD Sim each season getting to  might be doable even in your case if you play the last stretch at a quiet time a week out from the end of the season get  points in PvP or  if youve got a groove going. Once you have a mostlycovered  star getting that elusive th cover might be worth a shieldheavy push to . Keep in mind that many players have been playing for almost  times as long as you and its a game of longterm payoff.star covers used to cost  HP now  CP and it wasnt a bad deal. If you can do it  HP on shields can be worth it for a cover you need but its a stressful agonizing experience when youre underpowered.Tldr Yeah the PvP system is kinda janky and frustrating but believe me the feeling of overcoming that threshold is really really worth the long build up. About a year ago I had a  Hulkbuster and the Blue cover I needed was the  reward it was  back then actually but PvP balance was differentI spent like  HP on shields and had some two fights come back to  points frustrating moments but when I reached that reward and finally had my first Champ it was awesome.,MarvelPuzzleQuest,dcgkvn7,1,t5_2zkzj

10621845,0,t3_5s0d7n,You will want IM BW and maybe hawkeye or spidey or whoever you prefer but your focus will quickly shift from  toons to  once you start unlocking the covers from the prologue.  Each  can be useful but good starters are OBW classic storm thor mags and I like wolviedaken because you can get a bunch of covers from the prologue to get them going and they selfsynergize fairly well.Only dump ISO into the toons you really need and use as you may think you get a lot of it but you will benefit from hoarding it down the line.I am a FTP freetoplay player under  days played and I am enjoying the satisfaction of earning my covers and unlocking new characters as part of the appeal of the game have so far resisted the urge to splurge so to speak and find I can still compete in most aspects of the game.The best advice I can offer based on what I have learned from this great community is to only spend your Hero Points on additional roster slots and to try and fill out your  roster as it will help you in the long run champed  characters give valuable rewards for each additional level such as ISO HP CP tokens and  covers.Hoard those precious Command Points and one day in the distant future you can use them to open Legendary Tokens.  Try and resist the urge to open tokens when you dont have the HP to open a new slot though Standard and Elite tokens will help you fill out your  and  roster but if you do have covers about to expire with no space and you do not make space by selling an old cover make sure to sell the cover before expiry to obtain the ISO.Juggs and Storm are useful as well but once you have a core group of fully covered  toons you can sell off every  except for  that you will use for the first node in Deadpools Daily Quest most use IM or Juggs but I believe now the door has opened for others as there are no longer restrictions for playing against certain characters.  Once you can beat the nd node in Deadpools Daily consistently you will be collecting a decent income of ISO and Taco tokens every day!And thats most of my starter advice.  This is a great sub to get ideas on useful teams and strategies especially those that cater to specific events.  The bottom line is to have FUN with this game!  If you want to get aggressive opening tokens that is your prerogative but you will soon find that you have a bunch of great covers about to expire that you cant use because you dont have enough HP to purchase the required roster slots.One last key thing to note that many do not realize until it is too late If you punch way above your belt size ie. open an LT  Legendary Tolkien way too early when you are still in  land your scaling the difficulty of the AI that you will face will be affected.  This is largely based on your top three levelledcovered characters including the boost that they get from events.  To put it plainly the starting level of a  is   is  and  is  so most will wait until they have some decent champed s as once they are boosted they will be closer to their starting s.

Since you cant move Bolts yellow you pretty much have to hope that it appears low on the field.Also if Banners transform tile is matched or otherwise destroyed then you wont have time for it to resolve before Bolts tile expires.If you get a second yellow cover for Bolt it gives you a little breathing room and youre not dependant on where it places on the board unless Banners tile is matched before it resolves.,MarvelPuzzleQuest,ddsl282,2,t5_2zkzj

11526394,0,t1_dg0azvg,Ragnarok is a weird one.  I agree that his kit seems like it should be better than it actually ends up being.  In theory his powers feed each other similar to but not quite the same as Thor who he is theoretically a clone of.  In practice though they just dont synergize quite as well as the actual God of Thunder though who knows maybe thats the point since in comics Ragnarok was never quite as good as actual Thor.In theory though red feeds blue blue feeds green and green does good damage.  But thats best case scenario. Overall his red is decent.  It actually does ok damage for the tier given that it has a utility effect too at  damage per AP compared with Thors .  His blue on the other hand is not nearly as good as Thors yellow.  For one thing it heals Ragnarok instead of doing damage but not with true healing in fact I think it might be unique as the only selfonly heal that is not true healing in the entire game.  Then instead of adding green tiles to the board it charges some.  This runs so many more risks than adding tiles.  Charged tiles depend on the placement of existing tiles so if your board is starved for green its not going to help you at all.  If they end up on two separate matches you run the risk of the enemy team matching them and taking the AP.  Not to mention that it also just cant generate any cascades.The biggest drawback for Ragnarok though is his useless green.  It maxes out at a measly  damage per AP if you hit three enemy targets.  Compare this with Kamalas  or Thors .  Plus on top of being pretty lackluster damage it hurts your own team as well.  Which of course is fine when the AI is playing him but players hate selfteam damage for completely understandable reasons.In the end one of the best ways to play Ragnarok is as a blue or green battery though really youre only going to do that if youre being forced to play him cause otherwise Iron Man Model  is a superior version of both of those things.  Though with that said if you do have to play him dont underestimate the value of an Iron Man pairing.  IM feeds red blue and green.  Ragnarok uses red to feed more blue and blue to feed more green.  If you can pair them with a strong Green user this is a combo that can very quickly accelerate some significant damage.  Right now Quake who is boosted is an obvious choice but Kamala GSBW or any of the strong green using s Iceman Red Hulk are also good options.  Keep in mind too that Kamala and GSBWs purples both offset some of the weakness of Ragnaroks blue by letting you more easily grab those tiles youve been charging.Overall I think Ragnarok could be made significantly better with just a few small tweaks.  Id if his healing change to true healing his green had a small cost reduction and the self damage was limited to Ragnarok alone instead of the whole team even if he took the same amount of total damage  at  you could easily see him become a much more played hero.,MarvelPuzzleQuest,dg2ioei,4,t5_2zkzj
