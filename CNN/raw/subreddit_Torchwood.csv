2808055,0,t1_cnn5f2z,Season  of Broadchurch was amazing. I think it is either on par with True Detective or maybe better.,Torchwood,cnn9my6,6,t5_2rsvo
2860315,0,t3_2suq78,Like a procedural cop show such as SVU and those?  A little bit yeah.  There tends to be a monster of the week in the same vein of killer of the week but theres also a really welldone overarching story.  The overarching storyline takes precedence every now and then but theres definitely an element of procedural copshow in there.,Torchwood,cnt7wcp,3,t5_2rsvo
3054761,0,t3_2v2qz5,Because dropping John Hurts name is a popculture reference. Plus the episode you cite was filmed LONG before anyone even considered offering John Hurt the role of the Doctor. And the Doctor had tried as hard as he could to forget the regeneration played by John Hurt.,Torchwood,coemh2k,2,t5_2rsvo
3577932,0,t3_2qqzpw,I prefer Torchwood to Dr Who! But i definitely felt like there was one episode of Miracle Day too many. Im not saying that in a bitchy way. At the time i just thought that there was one specific episode that felt a bit padded out. Like the filler track that everyone skips on an old album. I cant be  sure right this moment but i think it was the episode where they were on the plane from the UK to the USA. Yes there were important parts of plot in that episode that couldnt be skipped but not as many as in other episodes perhaps.,Torchwood,cq0422t,1,t5_2rsvo
5073679,0,t1_cuxk53y,Oh thanks for that Im not super familiar with Big Finish.And series  only ran to  right? The Instagram reference threw me momentarily because I thought that came about later on. Oh well.,Torchwood,cuxkjiv,1,t5_2rsvo

7743645,0,t3_3yquav,I think this was actually my first Torchwood episode but after rewatching it today I didnt think it was the best it was kinda boring.,Torchwood,d3me9ue,1,t5_2rsvo
9435844,0,t1_d9bwoh8,Actually just looking into it if we can date the episodes properly theres a chance Night Terrors and Closing Time actually happened during Miracle Day...Edit Hell depending on the canonical time of Miracle Day it looks like even the  episodes of Sarah Jane Adventures season  couldve been placed within it...,Torchwood,d9c24yz,3,t5_2rsvo
