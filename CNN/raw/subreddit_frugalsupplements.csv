3356072,0,t1_cpalxvw,Thanks for reaching out! Shoot me a message with what you would be looking to order and I can hopefully provide an idea for price point. I can very much likely do a better wholesale discount on Combat bars in comparison to Quest. With that said I can honestly say in my opinion the flavour texture and nutrition profile of the Combat bars blow away any of the other protein bar brands I have tried. Let me knowCheers,frugalsupplements,cpatf0r,1,t5_2ya8h

8219888,0,t1_d5517lx,Damn. And I didnt really enjoy the Complete Cookie . Too softbready pretty much like any shitty chocolate chip cookie. Oh well I would probably still buy them for the proteincalorie ratio especially compared to the Complete Cookies macros.What flavors have you tried?,frugalsupplements,d551ix8,1,t5_2ya8h
