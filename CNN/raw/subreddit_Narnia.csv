11653003,0,t1_dggqjqn,gt  That books are about knowing Aslan in whatever world youre in. Its not fair to impose a meaning on a text that isnt present in that textArent you doing the same though? Where does it say that this is what the books are about? Most importantly readers are free to find their own interpretation because once you write something it pretty much becomes legs on its own.gt the point remains the same. Death is only the beginning of the story not the end.Yes thank you for stating again the point that I have been disagreeing with without you actually defending it.gt To put it plainly these are Christians who continue to gather together to talk about Christ. This is something that happens all the time all around the world.And this is why the last book doesnt hold water if you remove the allegory which is something that I already requested in my post. Its obviously not a simple social gathering with friend discussing the past its a Christian gathering.gt This world isnt fake its just not our permanent home.Again how could you tell that without relying on Christianity?gt She deserves praise for trying to forget things that are True?She deserves praise for actually trying to live her life and not wishing to return to a place where her adventures were already over. As I already stated the only thing wrong about it its her attitude.gt Both Narnia and our world are only shadows of the real permanent world to come.You just contradicted yourself. If Narnia is just temporary as out own world then why is it that bad that Susan forgot about it?In case you havent noticed Im not denying things stated in the book because they will always be true in its context. Im just merely disapproving of the way Lewis handled The Last Battle and of how Christianity is needed to explain the events there because without it as a basis it doesnt really tie up nicely to the rest of the series. And this is bad because it means that the Narnia books or at the very least  the last one are not self sustained and are relying on some external idea to function properly.,Narnia,dggvrwh,0,t5_2t3qr
