204514,0,t3_1wbczl,Definitely must praise the CZ.  Absolutely my new favorite gun hands down.  No longer am I the plain ol HK whore that I used to be.Great write up on some of the accessories.  Im not one for change so I tend to run with the same attachments and such but Im going to check out the magnifier.  I didnt like it because it seemed clunky but that little glitch seems useful...I hated the flashlight in BF because it was ridiculous.  I always felt like my characters eyes were burnt to oblivion but when I used it the enemy was like lol shes over there and it was simply a beacon announcing my presence.  The tac light in BF has helped on Op Locker for blinding enemies but as you mentioned its got limited uses.I dont think I ever ran with a laser sight in BF I mainly used a suppressor I think? but in BF I always have one.  One thing I always do is that if Im stuck capping a flag by myself or if Im hunting being hunted I always turn it off to be sure to not give away my position.  I do love kills on people who leave on laser sightsflashlights.  Perfect beacons saying kill me! kill me!But once again good coverage of the important things!,Battlefield_4_Xbox360,cf1qkrr,1,t5_2zhih

2082134,0,t1_cl4gclz,He had very poor sportsmanship. But I think the reason he sent me this was because I killed his friend while I was prone because I was hiding from shots being fired at me. So he assumed I was camping. His friend sent me a message saying poor noob. So I then proceeded to kill him x in a row. When they won the game this guy sent me all sorts of stuff.

3034139,0,t3_2ux48z,In my opinion its not as good as everyone says it is. Time to kill is very very quick remember when you had a chance to react when getting shot in the back in BF not anymore feels like instant death when you get shot.Tasers are one hit kill nothing like spraying Somone point blank just to get insta killed by the taser.Some of the assault rifle recoil is fucked up but Also the M and MA are OP as fuck right now.Im not happy that they took away LMGs from the support class and gave them shotguns and made the LMGs battlepickups. However there is some good things about it. Sniping is alot easier. The music in the cars if hilarious. sound of da powlece woop woop. The zipline and grapple gun makes for some intresting plays.Cant think of anything else right now but its not really my cup of tea at the moment but then again its in beta and things can change.,Battlefield_4_Xbox360,cochjex,4,t5_2zhih

They are  done with the other night maps and they will probably drop on the nextgen and pc soonish next patch probablyI dont think they will drop support until a couple of months before bf will drop just to keep up the player base.,Battlefield_4_Xbox360,cutemme,2,t5_2zhih
