10498593,0,t3_5qc28x,Each investigator does a horror check on the monster within range with the most horror. So in this case the same monster could be used for multiple players horror checks in a single mythos phase as long as theyre all within range. But no monster should move twice within the same mythos phase. Make sure you use those rune symbol tokens when adding a monster with the same name as one already on the board. The game uses those to differentiate between duplicate monsters multiple cultists for example. If you werent using those it could be possible that you got confused and moved the same monster twice when you should have moved two separate but identical monsters. ,MansionsOfMadness2E,dcy4jtt,4,t5_3hz0o
