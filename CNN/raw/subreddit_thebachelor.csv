449379,0,t3_1z80hn,Hey everyone this is our new podcast about the Bachelor.  We do it every week right after the show and are having a lot of fun with it.  Were just getting started but let us know what you guys think and if you have any suggestions!,thebachelor,cfrcd05,2,t5_2tj74
538217,0,t3_20a9bc,gt I dont find JPs lack of a proposal despicable.Nor do I. And there have been some seasons where the lead said something to the effect of out of all the contestants youre the one I want to be a part of my life I want to be in your life and I cant wait to get started blah blah relationship growing stronger blah us growing closer just the two of us blah what wondrous places it will take us blah blah blah.And there have been enough instances of lead winner or both coincidentally getting back with an ex shortly after After the Final Rose for us to reasonably say that Juanpi is hardly the first person to sign up for the show when in real life theyre not in a position to make a commitment to anybody.Because it is when all is said and done a show. Viewers even traditional core fanbase viewers know that. Disbelief is appropriately suspended. It pretty much has to be considering that the bulk of the cast has some sort of internet presence indicating their desire to obtain work in the industry.So its not about not proposing. Its about Juanpi being a world class asshat.For me the most interesting thing about the franchise has always been the viewers. Ive already typed way more wall of text than is polite so Ill spare you why.tldr is Im intrigued to see how a world class asshat bachelor especially one who was cast as fanservice will impact viewers and their views about the show in the long term.,thebachelor,cg1gabz,4,t5_2tj74

2925618,0,t1_co0m0hq,No. ABC passed because the last few weddings have gotten really low ratings.,thebachelor,co0nhnw,1,t5_2tj74
2960825,0,t1_co4j3i3,I missed the part where this happened in the episode but watched the clip of the argument on hulu. She calls out him giving Kaitlyn a rose over and over right? Because shes forward and the other girls started taking off their topsbottoms when she was there? I dont get it.,thebachelor,co4nrw6,2,t5_2tj74
3005811,0,t1_co8brt8,Honestly I dont think that the letters from Jueilas husbands family really changed my view of her or how the story was handled. I agree that she should have made it clear to the producers and they should have respected that the family didnt want details of how he ended his life on TV. Having said that the letters read like a grieving family still in denial. That might sound harsh and it certainly leaves out most of the nuance but it is essentially true.Most of the letter seems to be primarily concerned with how a few minutes on ABC is not enough to do memory to their loved one certainly true but not incomprehensible as well as subtle blaming of Jueila for what happened. Obviously we do not know what happened but their version of events seems to be less clarifying the record and more she was making his life a living hell. Im not a mental health professional but the letter seems to hold to a lot of the stereotypes of a misunderstanding of severe depression and suicide. The letter seems to be apologetic not because of the way that the man was portrayed on TV but because of the actual suicide. Based off of the number of invocations of the Lord and spiritual language it seems like the family has a hard time squaring the mans decision with their beliefs. That is fine and is their right but it does not mean that Juelia cannot have understanding of what happened. Either way I do think that it is bad form for the producers of this show to continue to allow stories like this to play out. Families need to have closure just because a spouse is ready to move on does not mean that the family is ready for the story to hit national TV,thebachelor,co9jtg0,3,t5_2tj74

I think anything Jubilee shares is going to come from an honest place rather than the see how nice and hurt I am bullshit that you see from the other girls. It will mean more coming from her but Ben is too big of a doofus to realize it.Her downfall will be that she simply wont move as fast and play the stupid fake games the other girls play. Ben is boring as fuck used to the other girls throwing themselves at him...and he will be a butthurt pissy little bitch when Jubilee takes longer to make a move and doesnt necessarily want him all over her.Jubilee is the best girl on the show but she wont win.,thebachelor,czd72qg,3,t5_2tj74

7881925,0,t3_4n8usq,Dear Chad apologists If youre saying Chad was only provoked into responding never initiated conflict then please rewatch this week and notice how Chad eavesdropped on both Derek talking w Jojo and Jordan talking w the group. He waited to hear his name inevitable as producers force everyone to talk about one another and then instigated arguments with both Derek and Jordan. HE approached THEM. Both arguments ended in Chad making threats.If youre saying its the editing even the most skilled video editor cant fabricate quotes such as I dont want to have to physically fight you but if theres no way to stop you from saying what youre saying then I will physically have to hurt you. Chad apologists this is NEVER okay even if a million Evans are provoking you all day every day for a year.If youre saying its not really his fault hes in a bad situation he signed up for this. He went through an application process to put himself in this situation.If youre saying relax hes just good tv maybe youre entertained by someone constantly threatening violence but a lot of us and dare I say many abuse survivors are not. When he says things like If he can do that things will go all right. And if not Ill be taking his teeth home not all of us are laughing. And if you are maybe you should examine that. For the record I think Alex Evan and Jordan are also assholes. Were they trying to poke the bear? Sure. Was that at the producers insistence? Highly likely. Do they deserve repeated threats of violence because of their words? Absolutely not. The Bachelor franchise is a farce in many ways but it shouldnt be a welcome place for toxic masculinity. And for those still defending him saying that the rest of the season will suck without him or going as far as to abandon the entire franchise because hes been ousted bye Felicia. Or Felipe. Back to TRP with you. Edit good job proving my point with the downvotes. Just like your idol Chad all you can do is react instead of responding with your grownup words. ,thebachelor,d4202o6,25,t5_2tj74

8673140,0,t1_d6pp0xf,My point in all of this is that she went to JoJo to warn her. Thats fine. Thats in private and shows genuine concern. But then she went and put him on blast on Instagram at the beginning of the season. That was unnecessary if her motives were all genuine. She put the ball in JoJos court and it was up to JoJo to decide what to do with the information. When she then went and started posting publicly that forced the showJoJoJordan to use the platform to discuss it.  To say she was forced to go public with it is untrue. Jordan and the show responded to her public posts about it. Not the other way around. Shes allowed to do all this obviously. I just think JoJo and Jordan are adults and can figure it out from here and even before his exs latest post. The show and his ex should just let them move on and decide for themselves. ,thebachelor,d6priw3,-8,t5_2tj74

8871563,0,t1_d7e5z9g,Thats not true. Caila repeatedly said that she did like Jared but she was there for a very short amount of time and it was a lot of pressure to put on herself. Can you really tell me that you know exactly how you feel about someone after a week of dating? Would you really end things with them after one week if you werent as sure about them as they were about you? Its reasonable that Caila needed more time to figure out whether or not they could work as a real couple and its not fair for Ashley or anyone else to take what she said out of context and use it against her. Jared knew that he was more certain about her feelings than she was but he was willing to take it slow and see where things could go. Stop vilifying her for being like...a normal person. ,thebachelor,d7e8jak,7,t5_2tj74
8873154,0,t1_d7ed0ov,Thats Ashleys version. Caila claims what she said was taken out of context which is easy to imagine. She said she basically told Amanda that she liked Jared but she wasnt sure how much because again they knew each other for about  days and most people dont know how they feel after that amount of time but Ashley heard what she wanted to hear and ran with it. If Caila truly didnt like Jared why would she have continued to date him in complete privacy for another month after leaving the show? I get not liking Caila I get being skeptical of her but its so irrational to say she just didnt like Jared at all. ,thebachelor,d7eff5v,9,t5_2tj74

10462881,0,t1_dctptzx,I agree. A lot of the girls talking behind her back is due to editing by the show too.

10604261,0,t1_dd9nmla,Agreed. It is such a shitty excuse to give for not having more diverse representation. Like sure certain segments of the viewership may not be ready and may not embrace her. But you know what? Its important to do it anyways and not kowtow to narrowminded bigoted people because representation in media plays a role in humanizing people and expanding peoples imaginations. Normalizing a black woman over thirty finding love on TV would be a much needed respite in this era of Trump. Screw Wells and his simpleminded retroactive line of thinking. I never liked himhe just seemed like the least worst out of a horrible batch of men. And while I like Raven I would much prefer Rachel and the group of more diversemature intelligentopenminded men that would come along with a Rachel season as opposed to another group of fuckboys that are sure to come along with a Raven season.ETA And while I understand Wells isnt saying he wouldnt embrace it this is not some nuanced treatise on the state of race relations in America.

Clothes finally fit them. Not everyone gets gigantic ones and a lot of women just want to feel normal.,thebachelor,ddfyqh7,26,t5_2tj74

Someone in RSs reader emails brought up the idea of Lauren B being the Bachelorette if BenLauren break up soon. Its kind of crazy but I could actually see that.

They sort of did the same with Jubilee on Bens season. Even though Jubilee was great they slammed every other girl and then were like but not Jubilee! Their comments on her just came across as very insincere and tryhard. They are better about it this season Ill give them that.And sure they lovingly snark. But they also end every episode with feminism fails and it comes across as sanctimonious not to mention hypocritical when they commit some of those same fails in their own commentary.

10737576,0,t1_ddnedaq,She and Shawn whine a lot about not being included in stuff. And when she was on jimmy she was an obnoxious mess. Id probably forgive that some but the immediate postseason stuff where they made fun of Nick on the ATFR and in their press junket. It was really unflattering  and left a bad taste in my mouth. I didnt even love Nick on her season. His rejected proposal created sympathy for really the first time and immediately after was when this all happened. It was so harsh and immature. People give Shawn a pass for being immature on the show because he had real feelings. But that crappy approach continued after. It was like Nah nah nah nah! I won you loser!

10796452,0,t1_ddtj91m,I never said you have a strange take on relationships.  I think you have a strange take on what relationships on this show are like what stage they are actually at coming out of it and what extra challenges these couples are dealing with.gt deluded yourself into thinking they were perfect in every way and you dump them the moment you find out theyre a real personI dont think this is the case though. I would agree with this.The leads that picked someone with kids are usually the ones who get dumped BradEmily and were highly invested.Just because the relationship doesnt last long after filming doesnt mean they didnt try to be fully invested in making it work.  They dont get a chance to talk about big things that can be deal breakers for some people except for one night in the fantasy suite and there is a lot to cover.  The relationship is always going to be super rough coming out of the show.  They barely get to see one another to work things out.  They have had months of scrutiny over every detail presented about them by people who really know nothing about them.  The chosen one has had to watch their fiance hooking up and possibly falling for other people throughout the course of their relationship making anyone super insecure.  The lead has to defend the other relationships that whole time deepening that insecurity.  On top of extra challenges they really dont even know if they like one another in the real world.  They cant know that until after the show is done airing and they are allowed to live life together  if they still like each other enough by that time to try anymore..Most Importantly Its not a real engagement!!!!They are committing to dating and seeing if they even like one another.  There is a big difference between I like you more than the limited other available choices all they can really say by the end of the show of the lead and the way the contestants have to talk about how great the lead is all day everyday creating a bubble where they put them up on a pedestal that no one really deserves and I truly love you and want to stand by you through anything that a real proposal is.You are setting realistic expectations for a real engagement but unrealistic for the promise ring dating relationships that come out of this show.,thebachelor,ddtks73,6,t5_2tj74

10806317,0,t1_ddukhz8,It just depends on what you want to do. If you want to work in criminal law as I believe she did chances are youre never going to make a killer salary. My husband was working in criminal law for one of the best criminal defense firms in the country frequently sought out by celebrities and nobody there was making a ton of money and everybody was working crazy hours even the  year old partners. Like I said its not really a profession where the workload decreases over time. If anything as you gain experience and notoriety your workload often increases and theres only so much you can delegate out as clients want to work directly with who they hired. And if you want to stay working for the government as she did then theres even less opportunity for growth. One of my friends from law school works at a DAs office like I believe Andi did and after close to a decade of working there shes still only making like K. And she works CONSTANTLY. Like I said its not for everyone.

Watch any season of The Bachelorette and youll notice this pattern. The guests meet the star and do anything they can that the producers have convinced them to do to get the attention from the public and the camera. Gradually one of the guests is identified as the dramaguest.  The producers wont let the star vote that person off till near the end of the season.  . The guest is sculpted by the producers into a dramaspewing villain.   My Vagine crap starts.. Gradually as other guests gain the attention and favour of the public the villain calms down and starts to become more normal.. Villain is kicked off normal guests remain.  Usually around final .Its ALL about the ratings.

I just cant do this American version anymore.  I mean I will but I am just so bummed after seeing the potential the show has and to know that they insist on talking in these tired out bachelorisms like its required.  Its so empty and its so fake and there really is no reason they cant keep the drama for the ratings but swap the cliche talk ugggghh Danielle L and Nick on all the beginning dates for the real conversation that show what is UNIQUE about each relationship dynamic.

11401334,0,t3_62p1sk,I disagree with so much of what Sharleen has said this season but I particularly have to disagree with her feeling that Chris Harrison was biased. He didnt ask those super tough questions to BenLauren but thats because they were likely doing well back then and the producers werent aware of any serious issues. However with couples like BradEmily BenCourtney and Juan PabloNikki Chris Harrison did ask those tough questions probably tougher TBH. The producers are in constant contact with the final couple and Chriss final questions are based on what he is told. He wasnt just randomly deciding to be mean to Nick  I think we can all agree at this point that he is FleissABCs darling as hes now essentially been the star of five ABC shows. I do understand her point about liking that Vanessa was willing to show her insecurities and vulnerabilities  but to me the degree of her insecurity at this stage in the game knowing all the validation that she had recieved from Nick like him wearing the zero gravity bracelet all season was just not a good sign and probably indicative of other issues. I also found it funny that Sharleen thought that scene of Nick kissing a crying Vanessa was precious and I was dying laughing because it just looked so ridiculous! I also still maintain that Nick looked at Andi and Kaitlyn more in lovethan he does at Vanessa especially postseason. I appreciated Sharleens honesty about calling Nick out for his whole I didnt know what I would do until today! BS. I hate when leads do that! Just be semihonest. ,thebachelor,dfobs70,22,t5_2tj74

11655555,0,t3_667mjz,I dont know if they shill for it but I hated Blue Apron. The recipes were OK particularly if you dont eat good food on a regular basis but took so so so long to make especially since you wont have much in the way of leftovers. We only had bought it because we have a toddler and wanted a quicker way to make homecooked food. So I guess I wrongly assumed by preproportioned wed be getting things prepped and ready to be tossed in a pan. It was just whole vegetables in a box essentially. I gave it a couple weeks then cancelled when they sent one potato to make mashed potatoes. Im supposed to spend my evening soaking peeling dicing boiling and mashing for one potatos worth of mashed potatoes?!If you dont know anything about cooking then Blue Apron may be a good deal. Otherwise youre much better off spending half as much at your local grocery store  youre putting in the same amount of work either way. Theyre really shady about cancellation too. You cant do it from the website  you have to email them separately. Then they try to talk you out of it first. ,thebachelor,dgh66y2,5,t5_2tj74

11704013,0,t1_dgmncj1,I didnt say she specifically applied for Luke. You keep misunderstanding me. Im saying that yes like almost everyone she thought it would be Luke. So in other words Im guessing Nick was someone Raven had zero interest in prior to coming on the season. Then she hardly she seemed very impressed by him in the first few episodes in my opinion especially with the Corinne stuff and I cant say I totally blame her. So what Im saying is coupled with the fact that she was so recently out of a relationship and she likely had never given him a second thought I find it really hard to buy that in that short space of time she developed this great love for him I just think it was clear that Raven was in Bachelor bubble love with Nick and Nick very well knew it. And yes Vanessa mentioned Chase as a possibility because her friend who signed her up like many others basically told her there was no way Nick would ever be the lead. But the point is that there was at least preseason interest on her part. I read somewhere that apparently her friend who signed her up for the show posted an Instagram video of her reaction when Nick was announced as the lead and she full on screamed. ,thebachelor,dgmo36m,5,t5_2tj74

11768377,0,t3_67x42l,I agree with you . I posted an update that Chris was the driver and was not charged with driving under the influence because those facts were up for debate at the time. The reply I got felt like the poster was jumping down my throat calling him a POS etc. Saying he was not charged with driving under the influence  saying he did nothing wrong or was sober. I was simply reporting a fact about the case. I did not defend or condemn him. I refrained from commenting again until now because I dont want to argue with anyone. ,thebachelor,dgtz5nq,6,t5_2tj74
11772841,0,t1_dgugsyt,I think its the photo where he is pouting that just turned me off.  I have a hard time understanding what he looks like since to me he looks different in each pic. The one with him smiling looks a lot better. Though he has a very very short neck which reminds me of Bentley. Maybe thats where my negative vibes are coming fromEdit I also just realized his model face looks like his face is scrunched up and smelled a bad fart so maybe that why lol. He has smell the fart acting resting model face. He is so much more handsome in the more candid smiling pics ,thebachelor,dguhgm0,2,t5_2tj74
