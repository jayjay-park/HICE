704599,0,t1_cgkbvgh,gt I suppose I can respect whats being done with transcendental meditation but I dont know much about it. I have to also wonder the extent to which EEG can effectively make conclusions about whats going on in the brain or rather at the surface of it. Considering EEG often picks up on things like muscle activity I have to wonder if the meditation merely allows the individual to be very still...Well theres issues with alpha EEG the Default Mode resting state Network and blood circulation in the brain as it turns out that the parts of the brain that are associated with resting all happen to be close to major blood vessels which many researchers are concerned may be interfering with our ability to distinguish between brain activity and simple artifacts from blood circulation so youre not too far off there I think.gtI also wonder the effect breathing has on it since it notes there are periods of up to  seconds without breathing.Well in modern neuroscience its pretty well understood that the thalamus which is the major part of the brain having to do with how the brain processes incoming sensory data also has a major effect on breath regulation. In general changes in respiration due to changes in states of consciousness are at least partly due major changes in how the thalamus is operating. In fact the very fact that the breathing changes so abruptly at teh beginning of teh pure consciousness episode is taken as a sign by TM researchers that the thalamus is involved in a major way with this state and theyve evolved an explanation to account for virtually the entire concept of PC that depends on a theoretical change in how the thalamus is operating.Basically part of the thalamus is involved in accepting  nerve signals from teh senses and and redistributing it to the appropriate parts of the brain. Visual information passes from the optic nerve into the thalamus and gets sent to the V processing center at the very back of the brain. Data processed by V is sent to V for more processing. From V its sent to V for even more processing etc. Of course some of that data from the various Vx centers gets sent to more distant parts of the brain for processing as well.  In fact at ever stage of processing some of that data gets sent back to teh thalamus where the processed visual data is merged with the incoming raw visual data so everything we see right now is actually slightly modified by what we just saw a tiny fraction of a second ago.This whole cyclic thing is called a thalamiccorical loop and many researchers think its the neural basis of experience and qualia and all that stuff.The above is the standard model of what the thalamus does during normal waking state consciosuness.During dreaming the thalamus filters out raw sensory data but still accepts processed data from the cortex and feeds it into the connections that are supposed to be carry raw visual data. The result is that we dream randomish stuff based only on what is going on in the brain without input from teh outside world.During sleep the thalamus is neither allowing incoming sense data nor is it allowing data from the cortex to get merged into the mix. The activity of the cortex is limited pretty much to localized connections between adjacent neurons.Any kind of mind wandering tends to set up conditions where the brain starts to relax and quiet down. In TM specifically the effortless thinking of a mantra now you know how to meditate and dont need to take a class right? sets up a localized feedback loop between the cortex and thalamus. The fact that theres no effortcontroljudgementtrying means that theres less involvement from other regions of the brain so that the loop is more localized than in normal thinking. This serves to setup and enhance inhibitory behavior in the thalamus so that it starts to shut down both internal and external data processing. This localizes that feedback loop even more so that the process snowballs. Eventually if theres no outside interference the thalamus should be filtering out virtually all internal and external activity just as it does during sleep. As a sideeffect of this change in how the thalamus is operating theres a slight change in sensitivity to CO in the blood which triggers either a marked reduction in breath rate or even an apparent breath suspension. This probably has given rise to various legends about enlightened yogis never breathing or whose hearts have stopped etc.Except that the brain is still in an alert mode so longdistance connections are still functioning but just in the default idling mode.Literally in the pure consciousness state the Default Mode Network is left active all by itself and neurons are left doing what they always do in all situations optimizing the connections with the other neurons that happen to be active. So for however long this situation lasts your brain is still alert but not processing sensory or sensoryfeedback data. Since theyre not being driven by sensory data the other centers of the brain are probably going into idle mode as well. If they werent theyd probably kickstart the thalamus out of its sensory shutdown mode and start processing sensory data again. In fact TM theory holds that if the brain were sufficiently stress free the brain would go into this pure consciousness state during meditation and remain that way for the entire meditation period but that hasnt been seen in anyone as yet. gtI understand the implication to self and nonself and I think that this area might have something to add but at the same time Im not actually sure if this pure consciousness is really consciousness at all. I think it might be attempting to describe something else and in that case it may just be a matter of semantics.Well if the brain appears to be alert but has no mentalsensory content and the selfcenters of the brain are highly coordinated during this state and the very first thing that can be noted as an enlightened brain starts up is the quality of self being aware that self IS then what other words are suitable to describe this state? Pure consciousness pure self samadhi turiya etc. are all terms that seem to apply. Peace that surpasseth understanding is a famous phrase from the abrahamic religious tradition that might apply.What something else do you think such words are meant to describe?Why wouldnt pure consciousness be an accurate description of a brain in an alert mode where no sensorymental activity is taking place?,Neuropsychology,cgkd6hr,1,t5_2rhda

1195707,0,t3_27sgp1,Generally speaking a neuropsychologist in a clinical setting e.g. a neurorehab floor for patients who are recoveringadapting to the functional decline from TBI stroke MS etc. would encounter many patients who were in a state of altered consciousness in a neuro ICU but who are at present no longer in a state of persistent delirium altered mental statusaltered consciousness. Neuropsychologists use assessment tools and clinical observation to identify neurobehavioral neuroemotional and neurocognitive dysfunction to assist in diagnosis treatment and prognostic planning for longterm care though there are often additional more specific referral questions asked. When a patient is not conscious or minimally conscious the average neuropsychologist will not have much to add to the clinical picture above that provided by neurology. I have seen the chief of neuropsych of a department consulted by neuroICU in a particularly unusual case where the treatment team was trying to come up with additional differentials but a traditional neuropsych eval was not what was asked for as that would be impossible for the most part. Rather they were tapping consults from all departments that might have dealt with rare neurological dysfunction etiologies.In research neuropsychologists might have more involvement namely on helping to explore theories on the transition between different states of consciousness e.g. normal transitions like falling asleep to pathological transitions like narcolepsy delirium coma. Though the authors are neurologists this article discusses many of the neuropsychological components of disorders of consciousness which is where the field contributes.

2961391,0,t3_2u34tw,Im tremendously unqualified  an undergraduate with rudimentary knowledge and minimal experience in neuropsychology  so take my thoughts on this with the appropriate amount of weight.Caveat aside look into sleep cycles.  Youll find that its very common for people to have brief waking periods or even periods of semiconsciousness throughout the night.  Also since you recall having dreams and dreams are typically associated with REM sleep there at face value doesnt seem to be any issue with you progressing through standard sleep cycles.  This is a fairly typical and healthy sleep cycle pattern notice the  brief awakenings throughout the night.  Intermittent periods of wakefulness are not uncommon in healthy sleep cycles.  From your description it doesnt appear that the awakenings are disturbing your cycle significantly as they are all very brief and youre able to resume sleep quickly thereafter.However if youre feeling chronically fatigued or genuinely concerned enough about the possible perturbation Id urge you to get a referral from your doctor to see a specialist.,Neuropsychology,co4q3io,2,t5_2rhda

3370664,0,t3_2yr9zj,It is my understanding the PhD programs in the US will pay your tuition and provide you a stipend.  If it does not then you need to rethink the situation.  I plan on leaving my program without any additional education debt which is ideal since my undergrad was so expensive.  Some people take out loans for additional monies but I really think thats unnecessary.  You can defer loans and find cheap housing pretty much anywhere.  The stipend is set based on cost of living prices and should be able to support you without an issues.   EDIT I do want to add that psychology programs are less funded than the other sciences i.e. bio biomed etc..  I have a friend in a psychology program whose stipend is significantly less than mine and only supports her for the  months shes in school. She has to do TAs in order to receive more income.

3685162,0,t1_cq9txe3,You might enjoy looking into articles that talk about how long it takes to form a habit  since a habit is essentially when something that once required consciouscortical effort is now performed subconsciouslysubcortically and with a feeling of automaticity instead of effort. A bestselling book written by a plastic surgeon in the s PsychoCybernetics popularized the idea that it took  days to form a habit and that idea is still around though I now most often hear  days instead of  for some reason. However research suggests that on average its probably three times that long with wide variation  both on an individual level and based on the complexity of the task. Here is a readable article that discusses this research which suggests a range of  to  days with an average of . Of course the process of something moving from cortical to subcortical control happens gradually and you can see it in secondsminutes e.g. complete a maze... now complete the same maze a few more times.... yup that maze is moving from a task that was corticallycontrolled to something more controlled by your subcortical structures like your basal ganglia. And most tasks require some combination of flexible alteration between cortical and subcortical control  the classic example is driving which you can probably do on autopilot most of the time freeing your frontal lobe for things like listening to your passenger talk thinking about your route worrying about your day or rocking out to classic tunes. However your frontal lobe needs to be available instantly if driving conditions change suddenly or the route changes and then once the crisis is over you can go back to subcortical control of an activity etc etc. That happens in sports too and all kinds of everyday tasks. The process of learning facts  going from shortterm memory to longterm memory  is a little different and involves longterm potentiation and other processes but I think youre mostly asking about behaviors that feel automatic like habits. ,Neuropsychology,cqcbzyc,1,t5_2rhda

8852229,0,t3_51evvk,The Wechsler subtests can be considered true neuropsychological tests. The way that they are used in neuropsychology is quite different from how they are used in education and other fields however. Specifically neuropsychology regards assessing specific neurological functions and general intellectual ability is not a specific neurological function. It is sometimes useful to get an IQ to figure out what level of functioning to expect on other tests but I am generally not trying to measure intelligence when I use Wechsler subtests. I might give Coding as a measure of processing speed Information as a measure of remote memory Similarities as a measure of reasoning skills Block Design as a measure of parietal visuospatial abilities etc. Many of the Wechsler subtests were direct adaptations of neuropsychological measures so if a neuropsychologist is intending to use them as such it is ridiculous to say that they are not true neuropsychological instruments. The ability to be a true neuropsychological instrument depends upon the intent and expertise of the user  it is not a property of the test itself.I strongly recommend you chase down a copy of the classic article IQ R.I.P. by Muriel Lezak. It outlines a view of intelligence that is fairly deeply entrenched in a good portion of the neuropsychological community.
