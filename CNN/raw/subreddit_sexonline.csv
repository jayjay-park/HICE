6414949,0,t3_43hax9,I found this article very interesting and relatable to read as a women. Like many of you have already mentioned the fact that this women has the strength to speak out and stand up for herself and other women is awesome. This is something that happens very often where women will receive unwanted pictures from men and not know what to do or say to stand up for themselves. Given that sometimes women do ask for these pictures I feel like they are sent more so unwanted then they are wanted. This same thing has happened to me in the past where this guy was sending pictures to me that I did not want to receive and at the moment I didnt know what do. Eventually after telling him many times to leave me alone I eventually had to block his number and all his social media account. These instances are something that make women feel violated and I think it is amazing that this women and model is able to speak out about it and standup for us women!,sexonline,czitcbt,1,t5_3bkcb
6428262,0,t3_43hax9,When reading the article I found it pretty interesting because I for one did not even think instagram models even really read their messages. Im not too surprised that she receives those pictures but I am very surprised that she actually responds to them and that she goes out of her way to find their girlfriends and message them something. In a way I understand because no girl should be dating someone that sends nude pictures to a random person online while being together BUT Im not too sure if thats the way to find out. No doubt those guys deserve it but if I was the girl friend I would be embarrassed and disturbed ,sexonline,czk7xqy,1,t5_3bkcb
6492367,0,t3_43n89i,As a psychology major I appreciate that you brought up the topic of Freud when it comes to sex online. I have had friends get cat fished and honestly in high school some friends and I tried to catfish someone else. Not to the extent of making a whole new persona but more like John Tucker Must Dieesque. I think that it is far too easy to pretend to be someone that we are not online the computer screen acts as the shield blocking the real us from the rest of the world. Whether or not this is true or not or whether we are indulging in not being ourselves the entirety of society falls into the hole that is the internet.,sexonline,czquy15,1,t5_3bkcb
6662206,0,t1_d06q86n,I understand your point and reasoning but I think it should be encouraged. People dont have to be promiscuous about when they have sex before marriage but it is important to not only have mentally chemistry but physical chemistry as well in my opinion. Many of my older friends whom are religious wait till marriage and end up considering divorce or are divorced based on the chemistry as well as finances but thats a different story.Its a good thing to explore and to see what you like minus being promiscuous of course. ,sexonline,d08fgpz,1,t5_3bkcb
6666905,0,t3_46tg1y,This article was very detailed and full of interesting laws and rules I was completely unaware about. To start I find it absolutely absurd that teenagers who sent each other these types of pictures are being charged with a felony. I havent heard of many cases like this but I find it hard and upsetting to see people who are unable to have children or go to the park or mall or anything involving children because of sexting. They live their lives wasted being charged for something so stupid and now are registered sex offenders. I agree  with the fact that it affects teenagers and people who get involved with authorities. Although I do also believe there are people who are legit sex offenders and actions must take place. In all we live in a world where the web and internet is in almost everything we do. Communication entertainment paying bills and even making time to meet people. To me it seems almost impossible to be so naive and think that teens are doing these types of things everyday. It is what our world today has become. I do think it is dangerous and can cause a lot of embarrassment and disbelief. But to me it is harder to see someone who is innocent lose out on a chance of life than a teenager being a teenager.,sexonline,d08wz7h,1,t5_3bkcb

6912712,0,t3_48ory9,I understand the arguments on both sides and I think its important for both sides to be heard. I have never been toseen this coffee shop Id only be interested to go into it because of the fact it was on Dr. Oz. I know personally I probably wouldnt work at this establishment. That would be because I wouldnt feel comfortable in my bikini while working but I also wouldnt be comfortable working at a bar where the uniforms are similar either. I still didnt understand the reason why these women have bikinis as their uniforms and I think thats the only question I would like an answer to. I agree with some of you when you say that a coffee shop like this attracts a certain crowd. If there coffee is good then Ill support but it wouldnt be a place of business that I would go out of my way to explore. ,sexonline,d0zvlc5,1,t5_3bkcb
6978589,0,t3_4b1dr7,Thank you for sharing this interesting video! I once saw a similar video which interview a vary popular Japanese male porn star Shimiken he also talked about some gross experiences he had for example once he and another male porn star was asked to have oral sex with a actress who didnt bring her health certification with her he described that there is some greenish stinky liquid went out from the vagina. He told the director about this but the director insisted that they should start filming. When her agent brought her health certification it showed that she had server STD and the two actors throw up and run to brush their teeth. It also surprised me that the male porn stars in Japan need to control their diet and work out frequently to maintain their health status and body shape. Different from the U.S. there are lot of variety show on TV designed for porn stars in Japan.,sexonline,d17d0pt,1,t5_3bkcb
6980799,0,t3_4b058g,When watching Porn women really like to hide away and make awkward jokes about it. I think its because if a woman was caught watching porn they would think of her as whoreish while a male can watch porn and have it be completely normal. Women also by nature are more private about their sex lives than males. So when women sees this type of stuff in a public setting its uncomfortable. I mean Ive had guy friends openly talk about the different types of porn they watch and discuss it. And I can surely tell you that it was an interesting conversation to be apart of. ,sexonline,d17m224,1,t5_3bkcb
7089206,0,t3_4cjuzr,This was both a very sad article to read but also uplifting because Lara said as horrible as it was that this experience helped to change her life for the better. This article reminded me of another article that someone posted about another former porn star that had a really rough time in the porn industry. I noticed that the article talked about the possibility of passing a law in the state of California that requires anybody performing in the adult film industry to have to wear a condom. This article was actually posted in January of  so I would be interested to know if that law ever passed and if it made a difference in the lives of adult film stars. ,sexonline,d1jxhe9,1,t5_3bkcb
7194366,0,t3_4b1dr7,This video offers an interesting perspective it really puts the actors and actresses in a humanizing position.  After watching this video I dont think anyone would say porn is easy.  It was good to see that although many of these people were describing their grossest experiences they were able to look back and laugh on it.  Also a few of the actresses hinted that they were no longer in porn it would be interesting a video comparing their worst moments and their best moments and see a reflection from them on whether or not they felt their time in the industry was worth it or not.Nice bit Thank you!,sexonline,d1vxv3m,1,t5_3bkcb

7367424,0,t3_4g9fhr,Im not really surprised by this. Arizona to my understanding has always been a huge hub for sex crimes because of its close location to the border as well as the sheer amount of people inhabiting it. Think about this too Arizona Mills isnt that far from ASU and we all know how expensive it can be to attend even with scholarships. I was recently talking with some coworkers about that site Sugar Babies and Im sure Ive touched on it on another thread as well. A lot of the participants on the site take money for their tuition. As the prostitute in the article said sex is just easy. Not that I would ever engage in prostitution myself but I can see how an individual would choose that path for economic freedom. I mean its either work for  hours to make the same amount of money you can while prostituting for only an hour. And if you enjoy unattached causal sex it doesnt really seem that bad. Again I would never do it but I can see how someone would choose to do so. Perhaps if prostitution were not so taboo then it would be more commonplace. It is always joked to be the oldest profession in the world. ,sexonline,d2fmikb,1,t5_3bkcb

7464964,0,t1_d2qpudk,Oh my gosh I almost puked right now.  How gross!  Why would anyone do such a thing?  That just doesnt make sense to me.  How do young kids even hear about this stuff or find it?  I am so glad I never watched it because I probably would have puked right away.  Thank you for explaining it to me! ,sexonline,d2qpxui,2,t5_3bkcb
