10859327,0,t3_5v8mq9,Ingredients  eggs  mediumsized tomatoes approximately in in diameter or equivalent . tablespoon cooking oil preferably sesame oil  teaspoon salt or to taste  teaspoon sugar  scallion diced into mm slicesInstructions. Whisk eggs with a pinch of salt until the yolk and eggs are thorougly mixed. Ideally there should be a thin layer of small bubbles at the very top in practice thorough mixing is sufficient.. Slice tomatoes into approximately  wedges. Optional remove the top hardenedbrown part of the tomato near the stem for taste.. Heat a wok to mediumhigh. Add  tablespoon of oil when hot then pour the egg mixture in. Let sit undisturbed until the mixture is partially firmed and  cooked. Turn the fire off and break egg into smaller pieces with spatula. Transfer eggs out of wok leave some oil.. Turn the stove back on to mediumhigh add tomato wedges and stir fry until the tomatoes are slightly darkened and juicy. Return the egg pieces to wok and add salt sugar and scallion pieces. Make sure some tomato juices leak are mixed with the egg for visual appeal and taste. Enjoy immediately either accompanied with rice or on its own!I was really entertained when I saw this recipe among the list of FFXV recipes because its a Chinese staple and I cook a bastardized version for myself all the time! Above is a more traditional recipe for the dish which I tried for the first time this weekend. Its a pretty simple dish and it allows for tons of flexibility. Case in point when I am lazy and feel like making this dish I usually add just a fraction of the recommended oil cook the tomatoes partially before adding the eggs directly to the wok and skip entirely on the sugar and the scallions if Im out. As long as you have eggs tomatoes oil and salt youre end up with something resembling this dish!,CookingWithIgnis,de02a5i,3,t5_3hxb3
