445913,0,t3_1z65ti,When ever my cards got sick and died it was from too low of an undervolt or too high of an engine clock or a combination of both.  This was on LTC and I have not had any issues on VTC after I got them stable when mining LTC.What was your voltage before you undervolted to ?  Were they running stock voltage?  If yes then I would concentrate on your GPU engine speed and try to find one that is stable.  If no then I would put the voltage back to stock and then find the engine clock that will allow you to run stable and then start undervolting.I have read that sgminer has added the ability to mine VTC and it also lets you set the number of GPU threads by device so you can run some cards with  and others with .,VertcoinMining,cfqzfn4,1,t5_304q2

475300,0,t3_1zh4rs,PPool every time No worries about DDOS Better for the network more distributed amp transparent No registration or login to manage Lower fees Payouts direct to your wallet Most nodes also give you a payout graph better than anything Ive seen on a standard poolThe only problem is that the payout is very patchy but over time itll average out regardless of your hash rate.Just pick something off  with a low ping and ideally a high uptime and connect using your VTC address as a username and any password.Or shameless plug alert use one of my nodes     EU   Singapore   Sydney ,VertcoinMining,cfualuc,2,t5_304q2

478828,0,t1_cfuon6s,yep in theory it should be that simple!  Mining can sometimes be quite the game though!  I think I saw someone post settings somewhere around here for that card.  If not people will be soon as the card is gaining popularity,VertcoinMining,cfup235,1,t5_304q2
493656,0,t3_1zr6rw,Ive found some cards seem to run faster and more stable depending on the miner used. Even the same model of cards can need very different settings to run at their optimal level. ,VertcoinMining,cfwds4h,1,t5_304q2

803493,0,t3_23bao8,My first graphics card I sat down and bought back in the bitcoin days was an XFX. Honestly it served me really well. Ran cool never crashed. Recently I bought a XFX R  despite everyones hatred of them in the scrypt scene and it has treated me just as well. I get on par hashrate of every other card type and it runs cool. I dont have anything to compare to so maybe its really loud and hot compared to other cards but it isnt much louder then your everyday tower fansceiling fans and it runs at about c with maybe  as the max fan speed. While I might be an odd one out here if you can get them for cheaper then normal I would go for it but that is just my opinion.,VertcoinMining,cgvlznq,2,t5_304q2

927840,0,t3_24q8ai,Hi. So to set up a  GPU miner u said run  R....etc using the CPU you currently own all you really need is a MOBO that has a LGA  socket socket type of your CPU and at least  PCIEX slots  GB of ram I believe that older socket type takes ddr and adequate Power Supply I think  would cover  R s but I would dbl check.  This MOBO is a good example of what you would need please dont bid against me on this specific one I am trying to help you after all  add g of ram and your GPUs and your ready to mine you could put  GPUs on this board.
