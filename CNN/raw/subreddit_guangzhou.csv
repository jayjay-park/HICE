3856261,0,t1_cqvu7wj,Great thanks so much  especially for the banking pointers! Yes BOC sounds like a good solution for me for things like booking train tickets etc.I searched for Decathlon  it seems like the closest one to Tianhe would be at the northern end of the No.  Metro Line at Huangcun. Have you ever visited that branch?I suppose it makes more sense to set up the bank account and have cash ready first and then go over with Visa and cash as equal options...,guangzhou,cqvul6h,2,t5_2sgfm
6131744,0,t1_cylr59w,Thanks! Yes I understand that. However I have heard of people teaching there without a Bachelors who do in fact have a Z visa. So if I can I would like to find some of these people. If they dont exist Ill try another route.Are you teaching there?,guangzhou,cymm5tr,1,t5_2sgfm

8560343,0,t1_d6bkwsa,Id say in my unscientific view that this depends a lot on how the weidiren try to get involved with local Cantonese and try to learn the language. My wife is from Jiangxi but has been in Guangzhou about  years.  of her friends are Cantonese and she speaks Cantonese far more now than Putonghua.  My Quality Manager also from Jiangxi has been here  years. Another fluent Cantonese speaker.  Though Ive worked with other migrants whove been here  years who have my level some words and numbers. Mainly because theyve not made any effort.  My view of the Cantonese is that they are open to outsiders as long as they make an effort to learn the language. Which sounds like a lot of British French etc........,guangzhou,d6bmbpm,2,t5_2sgfm

11776345,0,t3_680xk3,Are mosquitoes more attracted to people with type O blood? Im not O but I feel like mosquitoes always bite me as opposed to other people. Haha.Its not that bad in GZ or at least not Southeast Asia levels imo but if you open windows they will come in. If there are mosquitoes in my room I usually light a mosquito coil but I doubt the fumes are healthy to breathe in so I should probably look for an alternative. Ive never really been bit much outside but I guess I dont really go into wooded areas here.,guangzhou,dguvvr6,2,t5_2sgfm
