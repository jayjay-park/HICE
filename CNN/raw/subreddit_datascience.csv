552820,0,t3_20gmno,I agree that Data Science has been morphing.Since the introduction of MapReduceHadoop the low hanging fruit was tools. Work still continues in this area.Once these tools reached sufficient usability and started to get handled and developed sufficiently the next low hanging fruit was correlations. Work continues in this area but businessfolks are realizing correlations arent always scalable.Now I predict the focus will be on smart data essentially econometrics and structuredinformed machine learning.,datascience,cg341zw,2,t5_2sptq

2152447,0,t3_2jm827,notagingers answer is quite good and thorough so Id mostly just highlight a few of the areas he touched on. First totally agree on the varying definitions of data scientist. At some places it can be a glorified data puller whereas others it might be more of a modelerstatistician and others its more of a software engineer who knows a little stats. I think my group skews a little farther to the statssavvy software engineer but also has some of the other two aspects as well. That ends up manifesting itself as a lot of Python programming on Linux for local stuff or Hadoop or Spark for distributed work with a little Scala thrown in if your preferences go that way. Depending on your own strengths in each of those areas as you assess prospective roles make sure you understand which of those things the employer is really looking for so you can figure out if its really what interests you.Second as one of the senior data scientists within my group my responsibilities often skew more heavily towards that convincing others piece than they used to. I also spend a lot more of my time helping some of the more junior folks figure out how to solve some of the problems that arise. In general Id say the junior people in my group tend to do more of the technical work than the senior members on projects and the senior data scientists do more of the designing of the solutions implemented by the junior members and explaining of methods and results to non or lesstechnical colleagues though I do get some handsonkeyboard time too. Lastly Id imagine notaginger is probably exaggerating a little by saying that the junior folks work on crappier projects  theres so much demand for the skills my group brings to my company that there really arent any crappy projects that we take on at this point. For us its really just that the junior and senior people work together to design a solution to the problem the junior people will take the generate results and then the senior people will help figure out how to make the results of the work relevant.Overall its a great time to be in this field. The hype of Big Data and the ease of access to cheap computing and storage thanks AWS! means that people who know how to leverage it can find a lot of great opportunities all over.,datascience,cldfauy,8,t5_2sptq

2472927,0,t3_2nvsxv,datakittenMEOW Posted the below in my post which was deleted.Thats a good question.The easiest way to break into data analysis from college would be to have a quantitative major. Computer science statistics and math are probably best. Other majors that expose you to quantitative analysis will do just fine.No matter what your major try to take at least an introlevel statistics class and a calculus class. If you have the time getting up to Calculus  and taking linear algebra would be ideal. You can certainly go further down the mathstats track but these classes are a great starting point.Consider taking at least your colleges intro CS course and if you have time try taking a data structuresalgorithms course also.Most entrylevel jobs are looking for students with some experience typically an internship or a research assistant position. If you have a CSstatsmath degree you can probably get away without doing an internship if you arent majoring in any of these I didnt try really hard to get some sort of data analysis internship. You likely wont be doing any sort of intensive analysis most likely it will be data cleaning and such but any experience you can get that exposes you to data will help you build experience.Really think about why you are interested in data analysis. The problem with entrylevel jobs is they usually are flooded with applicants most of whom dont have the requisite experience. Stand out from the crowd by taking the time to consider why you are interested in data analysis and how your coursesexperiences etc. all have led you towards this career path.,datascience,cmhcoxm,3,t5_2sptq

2559378,0,t1_cms70ay,Q How is the competition for job positions in this places? i.e. are there too many data scientist in the field? There are a ton of people applying for data science jobs There are a ton of people who just want a job There are a few people who genuinely give a sht about the job they are applying for. So that makes it easy to stand out. Just find a data science job you would do anything to get and then do what it takes to get the job. Which is all handwavy thought right? According to a McKinsey report Susan Lund et al. Game Changers Five Opportunities for US Growth and Renewal McKinsey Global Institute Report July .  americasusgamechangers. By  the United States will experience a shortage of  skilled data scientists Which means that its a buyers market. According to this study there will be more jobs than there are people who could fill them. And thats just in the US. k people. The subreddit only has k people now. So the odds are in your favor. The only thing thats always true is that nature hates a void. So what you see is all of the different data science fellowships bootcamps university courses MOOCs popping up to help fill that void. So there will be more competition but its still in  your favor.,datascience,cmsnc8i,1,t5_2sptq
2665294,0,t3_2qge95,so im pretty sure im a real data scientist because i do that whole yell at numbers in matrices until they clean themselves up then do all that mathcodemagic incantation stuff until i predict things sometimes ill go a whole project wo importing sklearn tis cray and i certainly dont have an advanced degree mostly because i dont have any degree because formalized learning is dumb and id rather spend my time learning by obsessively reading anything that bengio even thinks about publishing. but some people might say hey kirk that kinda sounds like witchcraft and obsessive behavior maybe not so much data science? as such heres some folks that i think we can all agree are Real Data Scientists and Maybe UnicornsToo!jeff hammerbacher b.a. mathdj patil phd mathpeter skomoroch bs mathedwin chen bs math bs csdatascope analytics  undergradgrad schoolcivis analytics  undergradgrad schoolit really comes down to what you want to be doing and where you want to be doing it. if youre looking to be in academiaindustry lab working mostly on research initiatives that being a rather broad research as lecunn works on very applied things for instance then youre likely going to need a phd and youll likely need it to be in cs. personally i dont think this is so much of a requirement driven by any inherent value of a phd again i dont have as much as a bs and i implement novel things from scratch pretty regularly so much as it is the signal thats sent by one whose completed a phd program and the legitimacy that lends to ones credentials i.e. my only recourse is to blog my work hintons students publish at nips like its nothing. on the other hand if youre more interested in solving problems and developing novel methods as necessary along the way i promise you much more fun then with rigorous selfstudy particularly applied selfstudy dont do some data science competitions. thats just a waste. instead do sit down with papers and implement their algorithms and not a lotta regard for sleep youll be successful in this field. the only thing that i can say id dramatically advocate for not doing in terms of your education decision is getting an m.a. in anything. its stupid that it even matters but you just wont get a strong roi and honestly you might lose value because of it i.e.  recruiters who as we all know are the brightest of the bunch will say things like why didnt you get an ms. it is indeed unfortunate that both and nyu and columbia are so pricey. however i would strongly encourage you to take a look at the online ms in data science offered by georgia tech a traditionally elite cs school that really has an incredible data scienceml faculty. they market their ms in analytics as their data science  equivalent but if i were in your position specifically having had a math but not csengineering background id say you should take a look at their ms in computational science and engineering. both programs have about the same total cost of attendance i say about bc it depends on how you spread out your classes at about k. thats . as in seven thousand.four final points. for the simple sake of doing proper mathematics please please please dont ever take the advice to learn excel as a serious suggestion. if in fact you find yourself seriously considering doing so you should say to yourself excel is for investment banking asshats who couldnt make it through calc and i am decidedly not an investment banking asshat. i personally have never met a data scientist and felt compelled to describe himher as badass. i too originally came from a math not csprogramming background. i found that the best method of learning to code and specifically optimizing the process such that i would learn to code for data science was to ignore the traditional programming tutorials dont waste time learning to build games thats not helpful. yes it will make you a better engineer in general but right now in your position any marginal increase in your programming abilities is absolutely enormous so you shouldnt look to do anything other than whats necessary. if you do find yourself struggling w the nonquantitative parts of data science programming i recommend the learn python the hard way tutorialsbooks pick up a paper w lots of friendly familiar looking little greek letters and latex and similarly nice fuzzy things then park myself in front of my laptop implement the damn thing then get it to train and predict.  it troubles me that we live in a world where literally no one thus far has recognized what youve already accomplished. math is not easy. math in college is not easy. completing five higher level math classes at a fucking community college is goddamn impressive in my book and id just like to congratulate on such a significant achievement. you certainly have earned my respect. ,datascience,cn6ha1o,7,t5_2sptq

3369511,0,t3_2yr3b3,There have been many longstanding applications of statistical techniques in manufacturing but they go by the name of industrial statistics. Also these techniques require more specialized knowledge that the typical data scientist is typically versed in.Examples The equipment failure prediction model is only one of a large suite of applications in the area of Reliability Engineering. Reliability engineering concerns itself with predicting not only failure but also equipment lifetime uptime and so forth. Staples include Weibull and Lognormal models but there is more to it than just these. Applications include optimal scheduling of inspectionreplacement intervals budgeting etc. In pharma manufacturing chemometrics is huge. This encompasses various databased techniques for drug discovery batch manufacturing etc. PCAPLS type models are commonly found here. There are also a multitude of techniques under the name of QSAR. Design of Experiments is also a staple. the banner under which all of these are known is PAT  Process Analytical Technology In widget making industries there is statistical process control SPC for controlling quality. There is a huge amount of literature surrounding the use of data and statistical techniques to improve processes  typically under the banner of SixSigma.  In the process industries plant control are based on transfer function or state space models all of which are databased models. This goes under the name of System Identification. These involve fitting timeseries models like ARX ARIMA ARMAX and so on.  There are also huge areas within Operations Research for manufacturing that are very data intensive particularly datadriven logistics. There may be opportunities for applying new modeling techniques. But finding these cases may require a bit of work because statistics has been used for a long time in manufacturing industries and there is already a huge corpus of existing knowledge  manufacturing has discovered data science long before the term ever existed.,datascience,cpccl2z,3,t5_2sptq

3561532,0,t1_cpx4sfc,youre right but the Jupyter approach to multiuser is that you each have your own notebooks... somewhat missing the point. Its really nice in one way as it allows for separate execution environments per user which is nifty.FWIW Ive since set up a server with beaker its much easier to get rolling than Jupyter thanks to a dockerfile. Ive got a small gripe with it though its hardcoded to run on port  over  using a selfsigned cert... just frickin annoying. so not only could you struggle to get at the port corporate firewall monkeys for the win!  but youve also got to ensure to tell your browser to use  and then youve got to explain to your users that No the scary this site is not secure message doesnt mean ISIS are going to run off with your datascience and yes just click the proceed button that chrome has helpfully hidden under more scary text.Whats so terrible about running on  like a normal ssl service!?! Submitting a change request as soon as my ears stop ringing from banging my head against the desk.Oh yeah and the passwords randomly generated in the docker startup output and cant be changed!Rant aside comparing Jupyter to Beaker Beaker seems slicker in terms of finish and you can be up and running in minutes Jupyters got more fidelity and certainly the go to option if youve got multiple people doing separate work. That said if you need more than one person to work on your notebook both can work for you and neither will tell you which person did what so for me theres still a lot of itches that need scratching. For now Ill continue on Beaker however still need to configure it to push jobs to a Spark cluster so may still run into blocking issues.

5336547,0,t1_cvtkogo,It depends on the specific role really  which is often controlled by the industry.For example  for my junior role I would expect someone to have good PRACTICAL python skills first  and the assumption that they need more teaching in both the more complex mathmatical elements and also how to write enterprise grade Python  i.e. graceful failure modes well optimised gentle on the discs etc. By practical skills at a junior level  I mean being able to put together something like a data restructuring tool  i.e. generate metadata hash tabling recasting of elements spin the data back out in a different structure based on the meta  within a day and ideally quicker than that. Building something like a first iteration of a clustering model  i.e before tweaking and tuning and refactoring I would expect in a few hours.Something like a visualisation  I would be looking for something like generating an ugly time series with a high level library like MathPlotLib in  hour or so. Flip side is that making a pretty time series visualization of the same data may take an expert a week and a junior a month. Equally a highly performant very tightly fitting but not overfitted cluster model with a decent set of documentation and a confusion matrix might be a solid month or more of work for a junior  so they would probably really be  months of calendar of picking at it as they learn new skills and continue to refine it were as a senior grade would be doing that sort of work in a few days or a week.At the other industry extreme  If you were doing something like a BASEL model in a large bank it might be OK to spend a month or even a lot more finding an extra . of precision of fit to an existing model... which may actually be a mornings work giving a bump to a logistic regression and then . weeks checking rechecking and triple checking for every single possible edge case and still not being trusted when you say your done.In no way is that because the bank work is easier or they hire different people  its because the level of precision and accuracy needed between a RampD team and a multibillion dollar regulatory bank model is very different  and it takes different types of people to fill the roles  i.e. a bank would probably not consider  of my team  even the most senior ones for even an entry level junior role but they are damn good data scientists and return millions of pounds of revenue each every year.Equally  the kind of person who has the mindset to find that last th of  in a risk model probably isnt the right kind of person for my team and I wouldnt take them on either. I guess what Im trying to say is that context matters.

5580000,0,t1_cwokm84,I disagree.In the real world I completely agree that data quality data processing putting the right features together interpretability ability to sell the equation to decision makers etc. all that is very important.  See my comments above.But some models are simply better than others.  A competing risks hazard model provides better insights and the output of the model is better aligned with the next steps in the analysis.  Much better than matrixing a rankordering model that predicts outcomes at one point in time.  The competing risks approach also allows you to perform ongoing evaluations with more data than the simpler alternative of pointintime modeling.DoE is essentially fitting a model and knowing when a PB design will do the job vs a full factorial or dOptimal does matter.  The right experimental design analyzed using the correct model specification helps you to learn faster and faster learning yields proprietary knowledge at a faster rate than the competition.Now Ill also agree that if you know the domain a unitweighted equation can bootstrap you to the  rule.  So yes in many cases a simpler model is better.  But simple models cant account for data quirks like autocorrelated residuals in econometric models and that is where a complex model is required else you are fooled by systematic error.And I do  of my work with linear and logistic regression and the GLM so we agree for the most part but the exceptions do occur and even if you dont know how to fit a structural equation model with correlated errors of measurement its good to know that is what you are facing so you can get the right consult.,datascience,cwor1hx,3,t5_2sptq

You should always use something like kfolds crossvalidation to find the best regularization parameter to use. You can also try using the Feature Selection module  to test if any of your features are redundant or useless for example do kfolds cross validation using all  features then use recursive feature elimination to gradually remove features and see if your cv error increases dramatically.For Question  since you have so much data I would just take out the  with missing data.

Chasing margins this thin causes competitors to make models too complex and therefore too brittle. In the real world the model has to be stable and robust. Its not enough to be  on the leaderboard based on one sample. Kaggle models can be black boxes. In the real world you often need to be able to explain whats inside. For example when a bank declines credit application it cant just say our deep neural network thinks you are not creditworthy. The bank should list the most important reasons why the application was declined like debt to income ratio is too high. Kaggle models dont have to scale. Datasets are small if only because they are disseminated over the internet. Many realworld datasets are several orders of magnitude larger and you cant really sample them without losing accuracy.

Once you start seeing no further interesting structure i.e Hn is largely trivial for n larger than some N then you can guess that the intrinsic dimension may be around N. There are a number of caveats on that and generally this requires the existence of bounded holes which there is no guarantee that your data has.In general I would say that higher homologies arent that useful in data analysis except for cases where you know something about your data that allows you to anticipate it being interesting ... which is more often than never but less often that perhaps the TDA people would like you to believe.,datascience,d43qy5p,2,t5_2sptq

If you are new to data manipulation etc start with very basic questions what fraction of X is Y how does X correlate with Y.  From there you can start saying How can I use X Y Z to predict A B or C.   Step one shouldnt necissarily be build a big model and then fine tune it to win which is very different to how tuning typically happens in reality .

8625751,0,t1_d3zwxt3,I got an undergraduate degree in statistics and worked in analytics for  years. I just recently attained a data science position about  month ago.  Most of the work I did in the analytics position was reporting and ETL work. By a stroke of good fortune I was able to get on one predictive analytics project which helped immensely when I was interviewing for data science positions. It seems employers want some kind of hard evidence that candidates can do a data science project end to end.  I strongly recommend trying to find an application of predictive modeling in your current role or start to do side projects that demonstrate you can define a problem collectmanipulate data perform analysis and summarize the results.  I had some side projects on my resume that didnt even come up in my interviews though. A project that has a dollar value attached to it will have a bit more weight. I taught myself all my machine learning knowledge from online resources and podcasts. Some of my favorite resources belowOnline machinelearningmastery.com Andrew Ngs  Coursera class Books The Elements of statistical learning assuming you have taken linear algebraPodcasts partially derivative linear digressionsMy goal was to just completely immerse myself in data science blogs books YouTube videos etc for a long period of time. Eventually stuff that made no sense to me just started to click when I saw it enough times. One last bit  I would recommend learning either python OR R really well before you start to dabble in both.

Perhaps my experience is also jaded my department was academia or bust type of atmosphere where they expected their students to publish at least  times before graduating in top journals.  The students I knew not regularly putting in  hours a day usually got kicked out of the program through a vigorous qualifying exam.  So we all have our biases take my advice with a grain of salt. Bioinformatics is I think a good degree to have for data science you could get a job with that domain knowledge in data science fairly easily.Another thing to consider is the field might be different  years from now. You might also find you love bioinformatics and want to become a professor. You have other options in industry with bioinformatics. Overall since you have mitigated a lot of the risk my tone has somewhat changed. I think it might be a really good experience for you especially if you only need  or  publications for graduation.

So roll up your sleeves get some work done and be confidentThis makes me super happy to see. I have a double degree in Econ and International Affairs and am currently a Peace Corps volunteer. I started doing Udacity courses last spring after being dazzled by Hans Roslings work. I didnt really feel all that motivated to practice what I learned on old Kaggle datasets or the preloaded datasets that come with libraries like skitlearn. So I just started talking to everyone I met about what I was learning and asking for datasets. I quickly got a local municipality to let me poke at a workplace satisfaction survey they put out to their employees. While Im sure its not a professional grade report the graphs and explanations of some simple stats really impressed them. After that I did the same with test scores that the Peace Corps is gathering for our ESL program and then tried out the different ML algorithms I was learning about with Udacity. In the end all I ended up with were some comically ineffective classifiers. But it gave me enough to have a productive conversation with a local NGO that deals with open government data and a startup based in the capital. Both of which Im having a blast working with. Do I feel like Im two steps away from a position in Silicon Valley? Nope. Do I see myself as a Data Scientist? Hell no just some guy in a village with an internet connection. But do I feel like Im on the right track yep.

Lots of cities like NYC BostonChicago have open data portals where they put all sorts of things  calls where parking tickets are issued restaurant health ratings.

11760372,0,t3_67qony,Hello! I am part of the Insight Health Data Winter cohort of this year in Boston. Here are a few tipsAn independent project outside of your research domain looks more impressive. A project where you have done lots of data cleansing feature engineering looks even more impressive. Making that project answer a business related question makes it even more so! Projects based on APIs are fine even better if you demonstrate you found data in a more difficult manner. Personal projects from my cohort though spanned the range. Many did unrelated side projects others talked about a research project from their PhD.With that said Insight values your ability to communicate technical concepts well. Most applicants have the technical skill already but they need to show that they can communicate those skills well. During the application and interview theyre looking for characteristics that would make you a good fit for industry. If you can keep the academic and technical jargon to a minimum and still keep your explanations of your research and your side project detailed youve got a good shot getting in.Honestly it doesnt matter when you apply bc most applicants dont till near the deadline. I think only a few applications were reviewed early  for the cohort after mine. I only recall submitting my CV. Im not sure if theyve changed that requirement.Let me know if I can answer any more of your questions!,datascience,dgt2gbc,2,t5_2sptq
11762047,0,t3_67soqk,You understand it correctly. I have successfully used a similar method in practice with clients for their Twitter accounts. Two practical ways to go about this for you could be  Crosspromote with another channel that has high potential. One super quick way to identify such a channel is to perform some clustering on your channelchannel network then identify the highest degreecentrality nodes in clusters besides your own.However in my experience only going for the highest degreecentrality account is a mistake. Channels with high degreecentrality are useful for reach a lot of people but typically will see less engagement analogous to a highvolume low CTR ad campaign. Smaller channels can be effective because they have greater engagement with their audience making them higher quality in terms of the conversion rate and you can acquire lots of them for the same cost as one or two big channels. Go for a patchwork approach to selecting channels some high degree centrality others high local clustering coefficient.  Identify subscribes who might be able to recommend your channel to their friends. While this can be costly identifying and engaging with many accounts takes time the value can be greater because it more strongly resembles word of mouth advertising than an impersonal broadcast from a big channel. Lastly The data present two strong limitations acquisition and network bounding. The first one is selfexplanatory its not easy to get the data set you are after.The network bounding limitations could occur depending on how you collect your data. If you start from your channels subscribers and work your way outward like a snowball to N degrees this will create an egonetwork that can miss the big picture and fail to contain some channels you really would like to identify. Im not really sure how else to bound a youtube subscriber network though I supposed you could sample channels from topics for a more complete network bounding? The limitation there would be resources data access computers your time etc.,datascience,dgt9a47,6,t5_2sptq

At the beginning of class I flip a coin  depending on the outcome I explainshow the days lesson using python or R.  ,datascience,dgu34au,2,t5_2sptq
