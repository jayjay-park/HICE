But I constantly get into the same arguments with people and it turns out they are just repeating the same long debunked arguments from ancient WTO publications. The track records so far are not good. We should not give them trust. We dont owe them trust because they have lied so much. They dont get a free pass to misrepresent things this important.Also do they know? One thing that is striking is that so very few people understand these things well. Thats brought up constantly in the critical literature. So that begs the question Things with unknown consequences are better left alone. Why are we doing this then?,CorporateSovereignty,cxzibm3,1,t5_33gtp
