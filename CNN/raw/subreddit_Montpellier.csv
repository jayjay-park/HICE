419129,0,t1_cfo7ccx,Well Ive lived in Montpellier on and off for  years out of the past  years so Ive seen it all before the pool and library etc..That said we used to have our HQ with friends at a bar on Place de Leurope the place was called Manhattan Caf and it was cheap so we used to go there all the time.A friend of mine lives in Antigone and youre right it has that movie set feel to it.Odyseum I think they got right its not really my cup of tea but the activities part is quite nice. which was the first part they built the shopping centre later on. We regularly go to Les  brasseurs the cinema and a few other things there.,Montpellier,cfo7icx,2,t5_2t0ji
