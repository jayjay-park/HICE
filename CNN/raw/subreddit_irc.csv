220713,0,t3_1wmcla,What brings me back is definitely the regular users on our server and every now and then we get new people some stay and are really cool some show up act a fool and either leave and never come back or get banned. Ive been on this server for years and its always fun to talk to people about tons of different topics that I cant really talk about with friends IRL because they cant relate at all. I love this server and I hope it stays open for years to come.,irc,cf3l2a1,1,t5_2qh8t

As long as your  company isnt blocking the site specifically all your traffic is originating outside the firewall. ,irc,ctlyo4q,1,t5_2qh8t

10880814,0,t1_de1qe7z,Ahh okay thanks for this I tried control F but I keep having to scroll down through all the results I maybe worded it incorrectly I was meaning so it would filter it out for example ltPAgt Hi ltPBgt Hello ltPAgt Hey. Then if I search for PA it will hide everything else other than what person A has said so it will look like ltPerson Agt Hi ltPAgt Hey.  But I shall give what you said below a try,irc,de2a1js,1,t5_2qh8t
