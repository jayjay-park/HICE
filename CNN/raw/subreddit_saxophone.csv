4238124,0,t3_39gseo,Youll probably find a lot of decent and more elaborate answers to your questions in this sub if you search through past posts. But heres a quick summary of some of your questionsYour best option is probably to rent a lot of stores offer the option to rent the instrument and then if you would want to buy it they charge you the price minus the rent youve payed already. I think it would be hard to find a decent beginner sax in good shape for  or less. If you want to buy maybe try to get your hands on a used Yamaha student model they are great and not too expensive.I would recommend following lessons its much harder learning to play an instrument by book. There are so many things you can do wrong on your own and it takes a lot of time to set them straight again.A sax is loud especially when you first start playing. Your neighbors might not be thrilled about you playing if you live in a studio. This is something to keep in mind.The alto and tenor have the same fingering but differ in tone. Alt is Es while tenor is Bes. I dont play tenor myself I believe it takes more air support so I guess its a bit harder to play especially in the beginning. Also a tenor is more expensive as it is bigger.I believe the technique youre referring to actually is called growling but Im not sure.,saxophone,cs3c6hf,3,t5_2suce
4496098,0,t3_3cmz7d,Pictures would help.  If it is a Mark VI you dont want an average overhaul.  In the states a good job will be between  and .  Shop around but look more for reputation than price.,saxophone,csxe22c,1,t5_2suce
4643705,0,t3_39m8cb,Yanigasawa is great choice. I also love my intermediate Yamaha YTS for altissimo. The trick is to get the bad boy overhauled and key heights adjusted for smooth and even fingering. ,saxophone,ctfwkmp,1,t5_2suce
5092647,0,t1_cuzo5h7,the YAS does not age well unless you take care of it like a baby. I guess you could say the same about any sax but with an entry level horn especially this one it might be safer to get a prointermediateEditBut unforunately OP does not have that kind of money. The YAS is an good entry tier horn FWIW,saxophone,cuzusw0,1,t5_2suce
5649315,0,t3_3sdpjx,If you get something new that is higher end you should be fine. However I would stay away from the vintage one because the intonation on on those vary widely. Newer horns all are pretty even. So if you know you will stick with it try looking at intermediateprofessional Yamaha yanigasawah etc. ,saxophone,cwxcp62,1,t5_2suce

6300298,0,t3_41wen1,You will be able to make a sound quickly  many people find this very easy. The fingerings are pretty easy to get they are the same throughout the first two octaves. If you can read music thats a plus just get used to transposing to Eb. The hard part is developing a good tone and intonation. Part of it is dependent on what you are going for classical or jazz. So yes its relatively easy to pick up very difficult to master. ,saxophone,cz5rto9,5,t5_2suce

7492433,0,t3_4i07sf,Either youre pinching  or you just need more time on the horn to develop the tighter embouchure. The smaller alto mpc means those muscles will be  used more than on tenor or bari which when switching from alto feels crazy slack to me.If youve only been playing on alto for a few months  and not everyday  I wouldnt be concerned yet.  Practice your long tones  practice playing just on the mouthpiece and mouthpiece neck. If its your lips that hurt from your teeth digging in  thats a relatively common issue.  I use the denture product Ezo and cut a piece to fit over my bottom teeth.  Other players have dentist make molds to fit over the whole bottom set. ,saxophone,d2tukre,1,t5_2suce
8700336,0,t3_4z1hds,In a pinch I actually used a tenor reed on my Bb soprano clarinet.  I cut it to width with an exacto knife leaving the middle in tact.  It ended up playing like a really soft normal clarinet reed.This was just for a rehearsal.  I wouldnt have tried performing with it.,saxophone,d6t69za,2,t5_2suce
