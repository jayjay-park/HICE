863950,0,t3_21z7ri,Sift through the logic of your essay with a fine toothed comb. The essay is an argument after all and if your argument wont be valid unless the conclusions actually flow from the points that youve made. Also make sure there are few realistic if any idealistic redundant sentences.I was aided in that quest by printing out my drafts getting my lead pencil out and scribbling all over it with arrows and questions to myself. This would be more persuasive if it was mentioned above. This sentence has already been stated above. Does it need to be stated again?I think essay season must be coming to peak soon so hopefully that advice isnt too late.,usyd,ch2hiwk,1,t5_2sa3t

2400802,0,t3_2mu7x3,Ive seen numerous recommendations for University of Austin Texas. Austin being a great and liberal city in Texas with an active music scene and warm weather.University of Arizona Ive also seen many recommendations for with each campus offering something slightly different Flagstaff is a great little city with a good university town vibe as is Tuscon and Phoenix is a big US city. Arizona is also my favorite state in the USA with some of the most beautiful landscapes and plenty of sporting opportunities in any season from lots of winter snow to blazing hot summers.,usyd,cm8g4d0,1,t5_2sa3t

For instance look at womens beach volleyball  Our armour means we actually wear more than they do in that Olympic sport. but thank you for taking the time and interest to chat about it. Gridiron is awesome and I hope you check it out  ,usyd,cqix3la,1,t5_2sa3t

4253027,0,t1_crbv5kq,Yeah there definitely is scaling. I did that subject last year got  for the first quiz a really shitty mark for the second quiz and I somehow passed the course even though I didnt study for the final exam and I am terrible at mathematics. Thats telling you something.EDIT Also some advice. For those who have to do a second year mathematics subject to keep up with their course requirements then dont do MATH Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory but rather do MATH Number Theory and Cryptography. So much more fun and easy  the lecturer is awesome.,usyd,cs5169a,1,t5_2sa3t
4321872,0,t3_3ahkja,Yes just express your interest to the subject coordinator and they need to fill in a special permission form for enrolment. I did micr without even having the prereq subject completed for micr. ,usyd,cscsy9g,3,t5_2sa3t

5381186,0,t1_cvyqwg8,Yeah my program is part of the medical school so its on the main darlingtoncamperdown campus. That is quite unfortunate but i mean  Im sure its the same haha. Not sure if youve heard of this website or if it covers the area you need but take a look at  I was going to go through them but then I got the on campus housing.

6036415,0,t3_3y5rcl,Not  sure but did you overload at any point? If not then failing that unit probably means youre short  credit points so youll probably have to complete another subject before you can graduate.Best place to seek advice is with the staff in the Science Faculty they should be able to point you in the right direction.,usyd,cyavyru,3,t5_2sa3t
6418197,0,t1_czj6067,Wasnt sarcasm haha. Hard to tell on the internet. I am forever grateful for the information you are providing me with.Yeah actually waiting for an offer on UNSW first choice and then USYD. Decision will be made around May th since my HSC documents need to be uploaded. But wait I forgot to tell you that Im visiting this March thApril th for spring break! You can show me around the place haha.I have a scheduled campus tour at USYD on April st pm so will definitely check out the Meat Box place.,usyd,czj6f43,1,t5_2sa3t
6818052,0,t1_d0p3c26,Youre beyond welcome! I dont know if this will mean anything to you but youve given me a lot of hope. I really really appreciate you taking the time out to write your comprehensive and well thought out replies and providing the admission link to look into. Youve given me a clear direction hope and assistance. I cant thank you enough. Honestly. Thank you!I think Im going to aim for a bachelor of science  as you said it will help with the med stuff anyway and like I mentioned in my original post science is a passion of mine too so hopefully it means Ill do well! I guess it will also give me a good taste of what med will end up looking like since some of the units might be the same. I have heard the gamsat is super hard so Ill be spending a lot of my time at those courses for sure!gtIf med didnt work out for whatever reason you could go into dermatology related research. Do honours after your bachelors and then a PhD. edit clinical research is an option still have patient interaction etcThanks for this too! It can be damning to think all of your dreams are hinged on one pathway. Thank you for giving me options. Youve made someones life infinitely brighter today and I thank you for that!I hope you have an excellent dayweekmonthyear. Thanks so much!,usyd,d0p4hqh,2,t5_2sa3t

7966025,0,t3_4obhqm,Ive heard theres better teaching and easier marking at UNSW but Im inclined to think that USYD would have better everything else.Socially The USYD crowd tends to be a little more political arty LGBT friendly and cooler.UNSW is more gym junkie career. But they are both massive unis with huge cohorts you can find everything at either of them if you go looking. ,usyd,d4bggb3,3,t5_2sa3t

10531953,0,t3_5qssf0,You may also be able to get a proper library card. It was a long time ago now well  years but when I was doing my HSC they definitely offered some kind of special access to high school students.A quick snoop around the library site shows that they offer memberships to outsiders including HSC students. It appears to be year or  months and gets you the ability to borrow books and access to online resources when on site.,usyd,dd1wv97,2,t5_2sa3t

11104250,0,t1_deqnk3t,Hows Broadway a  minute walk its like less than  from Fisher. UNSW is so far that they NEED to justify its campus with a bunch of franchises otherwise theyd be pretty screwed if students wanted to just chill out and eat. But I agree with the Taste bar theyre very expensive for what they are.,usyd,deqno6w,6,t5_2sa3t
