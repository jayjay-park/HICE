4272787,0,t1_cs77wf1,As per WIKIPEDIA A variation of the basic Sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on Mars utilizing water from the Martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere. A  prototype test operation that harvested CO from a simulated Martian atmosphere and reacted it with H produced methane rocket propellant at a rate of  kgday operating autonomously for  consecutive days maintaining a nearly  conversion rate. An optimized system of this design massing  kg is projected to produce  kgday of OCH propellant ... with a methane purity of  while consuming  Watts of electrical power. Overall unit conversion rate expected from the optimized system is one tonne of propellant per  MWh energy input.Take that with a grain of salt likely would be using multiples of that  item to produce the needed fuel as well as for redundancy.,KSPToMarslanderteam,cs79e33,1,t5_377u5
