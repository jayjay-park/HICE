6748286,0,t1_d0h1yj2,Okay Ill give it one last try. When you say that certain types of stainless steel are nonmagnetic due to low to no Fe content youre implying that there are types of stainless steel which have no iron in them. This is impossible because iron is the primary ingredient in all steel alloys an alloy with no iron content cannot be steel. low is also a relative term here because again if iron doesnt compose the majority of the alloy in question then the alloy cannot be steel.As far as the nonmagnetic nature of Austenitic steels they dont lose their magnetic properties because of low to no iron content. The iron doesnt just disappear from the material. Austenitic steels lose their natural ferromagnetism at the Curie point of iron  degrees K around the same temperature of the Austenite transformation.As for L stainless steel it is indeed nonmagnetic but that is because it is Austenitic not because it has low to no iron content. According to the manufacturer the minimum iron content of their L would be . check it out if you want. L is also an extralow carbon steel which is why I thought maybe you meant to say low to no C content even though that has nothing to do with its magnetic properties.Now I agree that some materials are indeed nonmagnetic because of their low to no iron content things like aluminum wood glass plastic copper water helium etc. but stainless steel is not one of those materials.Im really not trying to bust your balls man just wanna help you understand that no iron  not steel.,specializedtools,d0hbv8a,1,t5_36ybr

8394695,0,t1_d5qthxn,The seeding is pretty useless. Its a onetime task in nice weather with nothing in the way. Just poke a hole drop a seed cover. The weeding Im very skeptical of. This thing claims to handle many kinds of plants. It looks like it IDs weeds based on not being where it placed a seed. How does it handle plants with vines or runners like the pumpkins it claims to support? The only really useful thing here is the watering....and they are doing it wrong. The gantry limits the size in  dimensions and prevents watering of plants with large shading leaves. Instead it should be a grid of hoses where every plot point can be watered separately from below.And if Im going to spend  on a garden my absolute first buy is a greenhouse to extend the season. ,specializedtools,d5qvtta,14,t5_36ybr

10017005,0,t1_dbcw3pl,It might probably would? be able to if you put a different sort of optics on it that also allowed it to scan back and forth rapidly like rLaserCleaningPorn . But even if it could you probably wouldnt want to use it for that. Industrial equipment like this all has very specific maintenance intervals that void service agreements if they arent followed and using it for cleaning itself would just put extra hours on it that werent devoted to production.I actually really like solutions like the one in OP because theyre fucking simple and they just work. Theyre usually cheap reliable and fairly quick.To be clear im definitely no laser expert but I do have a lot of experience with big fucking expensive equipment and service intervals ugh service intervals.,specializedtools,dbd8szq,1,t5_36ybr
