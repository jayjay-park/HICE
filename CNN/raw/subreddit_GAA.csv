5754004,0,t3_3tyl0r,As an American GAA fan this was really special to see. I wasnt able to make the trek up to Boston to see this but I was fortunate enough to see it on TV while wearing my Galway jersey my familys ancestral home. Now we just need to get this on TV consistently and with as many obscure sports channels as we have Im sure someone will be willing to buy the rights for it after seeing how many people filled Fenway for this one.,GAA,cxac7sf,4,t5_2sgj8
6413379,0,t1_czimils,Aye I was listening to it and it seemed that Cavans defence was causing all sorts of problems for Tyrone. Last couple of minutes was tight with a lot of unforced errors made by Tyrone and messing about with the ball.,GAA,czimx1w,3,t5_2sgj8

9555691,0,t3_5brc78,Anything televised on TV TG RTE RTE or Eirsport should on a stream somewhere. If you check the listing of these channels youll get the match on frontrow.eu or the like. Also if you have access to an Android OS anywhere the Mobdro app has all these channels too without having to fuck around trying to close ads from a streaming channel. Even investing a shitty Android tablet might be better value than GAA GO to save your squinty eyes watching Mobdro a phone.EDIT That said youre at the mercy of whatever these channels decide to show. Youd be lucky to see four Down games even if they made the league semifinal and finals.,GAA,d9qxosr,2,t5_2sgj8
