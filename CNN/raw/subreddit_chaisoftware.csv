10341247,0,t3_5mp362,Since I cannot create a new topic I am asking my question hereI have used ES File Explorer pro to connect to a shared folder namefoldersubfolder where I have stored several video files. I can navigate with ES Explorer to one file and open it with VRTV propaid version. When I try to change the video file during VR I can only browse my mobile phones folders and not the shared folder I am currently accessing anyway. This make me put off the headset and manually browse with the phone although I have purchased the pro version because I dont want to do so. Is this not working yet or am I doing anything wrong? I have spent several hours looking for solutions but I have not found anything. From what I see choosing mounting points is only possible with rooted phones but I think I should not be forced to root my phone in order to use all of VRTVs features.,chaisoftware,dcg8mjj,2,t5_3fayo

When using VRTV to open a videostream from an external app its started as a Cardboard app and then when you put the phone in the Daydream headset it starts VRTV again in Daydream mode. Disabling NFC probably helps then it shouldnt start the second instance when you put the phone in the viewer but thats not an optimal solution of course. Ill take a look and see if I can put up a new alpha but most likely Ill have to wait until I get my Daydream setup to be able to fix this.,chaisoftware,ddfn4i9,1,t5_3fayo
