5341782,0,t1_cvufve5,Great questions! In short community goals are semiscripted events set up by the devs and eventually triggered by power play that give extra rewards for performing an activity. For example right now if you go to Maausk you can join the CG THE WAR AGAINST EMPERORS DAWN This CG has you killing members of the Emperors Dawn in war zones around Maausk. In this type of CG you earn a special reward at the end of the event for turning in combat bonds to the station that gave you the CG.The reward you earn at the end is based on two things. First the reward tier. This is figured in this case by how many credits worth of combat bonds everyone participating submits. Each event has several tiers and usually the amount you earn is a multiple of the first tier reward although reaching the top tier is often quite a bit more.The second part is how you do compared to other people. Certain percentiles will have higher rewards but everyone who turns in any number of combat bonds will get something. Additionally completing a CG will earn some kind of secondary reward that everyone will access. This can be anything but is usually some kind of buy discount or sell increase.Just remember! You need to join the event at the station before you turn in or they wont count toward the goal. You also have to turn it in at the station that gives you the CG unless it says otherwise or else it also wont count.Most of the time the combat CGs are completely worth it. The top  often make m or more on top of the bonds. Trade CGs are somewhat less lucrative since nearby stations will quickly run out of the requisite commodity and prices skew. There are some other CGs that may or may not be worth it but theres never a penalty to join and not make any progress so it doesnt hurt to look into it at least.,EliteCG,cvugzep,3,t5_39mt1
5342148,0,t1_cvuiihl,I think people will get into the habit of reading the title for the system and station and I dont see how having the information in the body helps archival purposes so I would probably just have the system and station in the title.I could see archival being an issue though doing it my way. Even if this doesnt take off just consistent content would pile up pretty quickly. Maybe you could make another archival subreddit that only allowed posts from one person who crossposted expired CG posts and then deleted them from here. Or have a moderator make a master post for each CG that is stickied and collects the info from other active CG posts and then archive that post while everything else has a weeklong timer on it. That last one sounds like a lot of work but I think a bot could probably handle the archival subreddit. I dont really know much about making or using modbots though.,EliteCG,cvuio1m,1,t5_39mt1

You can still do that but they have no use right now. You could then after accepting the mission donate that data to the goal at the correct station. Contributing gives you a rank based on your percentile of participation and rewards scale up for everyone as more stuff is turned in. Lots of people participated in this one so we as a community filled up the requirement quickly bringing us to the top tier reward for everyone based on their percentile ranking and ending the goal.Others come up including trading CGs and bounty hunting CGs where you get the money from selling goods or bounty vouchers and then when it completes you get the end payout.,EliteCG,dct7qfa,3,t5_39mt1

11209058,0,t3_5zr2ox,noob qns how is this fed when the system and the station are independent and if it is FED do you get rank increase,EliteCG,df2j8go,2,t5_39mt1
11218466,0,t1_df3f98e,I find about half of my bounties from Anima are Fed but it varies from session to session. I can usually get  million cr or more in fed bounties in an hour in my Vulture. RES Zones are really active.If others want to bounty hunt at Anima here is my report It is currently in civil unrest The nav beacon is compromised The main station is ls from the system center RES zones are about ls from the station I find the best hunting is on the third planets rings The second planet is a little closer but the RES zones are too close to the hot planet which make it easy to overheat. It is ly away so if you have a low jump range on your ship you will likely want a second ship with a large jump range like the hauler if you need something on the cheap to deliver the Fed bounties when you think youve accumulated enough,EliteCG,df3ll1n,1,t5_39mt1
