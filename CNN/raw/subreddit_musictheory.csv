While it may take some getting used to its an amazing piece of orchestration. Everything from the knowledge of string technique and timbre to the interaction of the voices and motivic development is on a genius level and it all manages to stay interesting while deviating little from a few simple rhythmic motives. While it may not be tonal it does use a tonal center and plays by a set of intervallic rules that is in many way similar to the way tonal music uses the gravity of a tonic.

Between these beat I walk up and down the scale I am currently playing in mainly using the notes that are already in the triad and ths.

One can easily make the argument depending on the root note that a GmajD is actually an EmD or vise versa.

385426,0,t3_1ygyxf,For a Basic Explanation of the Modes OP delivers! Wellwritten too. I like writers that put the theory in relatively simple terms and dont weigh their lessons down with overtly complicated terminology. That said I feel you could keep the basic tone of this lesson and make an alltooimportant connection for your readers. Please allow me to suggest itgtUsing numbers from one to seven the Dorian mode can be spelled   b    b.  That means D Dorian is like D major except that the third and seventh notes have been flatted. Here I think a more helpful approach is to group Dorian and Phrygian in the Minor Modes category and compare them to the Aeolian Natural Minor scale. This gives you just ONE pitch to address in relation to natural minor  the Natural th or Raised th in Minor. This is important because it helps us categorize the modes by their specific tendency tones each of the four basic modes has exactly ONE tendency tone. Again with E Phrygian you compare it to major. I recommend comparing it to Minor instead. You even mention both in your Dorian and Phrygian explanations that the tonic chords are minor great! so it ought to be a very easy edit should you choose to make any changes. Finally for the Locrian Mode I would recommend introducing the Diminished Scale  b b     b  a synthetic substitute of the Locrian Mode that sort of combines the Dorian Raised th Phrygian b Lydian  and Mixolydian b all in one neat package. It is also known as the Octatonic Scale. This is the melodic equivalent Im most familiar with in writing for concert band. The Locrian Mode is generally not used in its Relative form. So there you go. This is a really great write up. I cant speak to the fret board images as far as accuracy since Im no guitarist.

424799,0,t1_cfoau1j,In most basic terms a hexachord is a group of six pitches.  In twelve tone music tone rows can be grouped and analyzed in sections based upon the number of notes you want to group. By grouping the row into two groups of  you get two hexachords.  Combinatoriality is the attribute of tone rows concerning what happens when you combine two row forms.  For Instance if you take the Prime row and a transposition of its Retrograde Inversion or RetrogradeInversion how do the two rows compare concerning which pitches are where.  For any row the P and R are Hexachordally Combinatorial because the first six notes of the prime row and the first six notes of the retrograde will have no repeats and thus all twelve notes will be present in both halves of this combination.  Example using the most basic row  P            |      R        |         Some rows have the special case that if you combine the prime row with a transposition of its inversion you also get hexchordal combinatoriality.  With the row from the previous exampleP            |       I       |        Obviously this row would lead to a horrible piece of music but it illustrates the point.  The trick is to find musically interesting rows that have Hexachordal Combinatoriality.   Edit Formatting,musictheory,cfosn98,2,t5_2qrjj

584538,0,t3_20tgv1,You may find the many discussions on this topic in rcomposertalk to be helpfulinteresting. Personally I am big on structure and form. Even if the structure is going to be throughcomposed or free form I spend a lot of time mapping out how I want the overall piece to sound or what story I want it to tell. Im a singer so I often find it helpful to be guided by poetry or prose  even if Im not setting the music to a text exactly I like to use the basic arc as a starting point for many pieces. Mythology is a great place to go for this  a lot of mythological stories have very clear arcs that can easily be set to music and tend to be readily available since folkloremythology is typically public domain or easy to access.Id also stress the importance of thinking holistically about all the aspects of music. Many beginning composers rely too heavily on things like chord progressions or formal structure. While those are important things to consider there are aspects like orchestration counterpoint motivic development and rhythm that can be equally as important. These are also really good ways to stretch your musical ideas  while its normally not very interesting to hear a repeat of the exact same chord progression revoicing the progression and working in a more varied melodic development can give the piece movement without actually requiring much new material. I also personally find a LOT of my inspiration from the instruments themselves. I am always trying to write music that shows off the best an instrument can offer. So Ill spend a lot of time thinking about the technical constraints of the instrument the alreadyexisting repertoire for that instrument and the sounds and colors it produces. So one logical conclusion about this practice is that writing for new instruments almost always inspires a lot of creativity. So if you find yourself tending toward one instrument lets face it we all love writing for our primary maybe try something completely different.,musictheory,cg6psmv,5,t5_2qrjj

How you use the alto voice is up to you.If youre writing part homophonic vocal music like a Bach chorale then the bass is the bass the soprano is the melody and the tenor and alto fill in the other notes of the harmony while staying out of the way.  If youre writing part contrapuntal vocal music like a Monteverdi motet then theres no set melody and every voice does its own thing usually in its own range.  If youre writing modern a cappella then the alto is one more color you can use the bass pretty much has to be the bass but the other voices can split the melody and accompaniment parts.  You can also write in more than four parts.The way youre talking about it though youre trying to squeeze reggae into Bach chorales and its not going to work.  Theyre different.  In a fourpart chorale setting the alto and tenor are accompaniment and tend to stay out of the way unless theres some surprise counterpoint going on.  In rock you have a guitar you dont need an alto and a tenor.  Or even a soprano.  You have drums bass accompaniment guitar and the lead singer on the melody.

There was quote by Alban Berg that blew my mind and it was Melody is the basis of all music. This was one of the three of the second Viennese school that were moving away from tonal music so that led to so more research on melody of which really there isnt anything! I am pretty close to getting actual theory that is generative instead of speculative which is what most music theory suffers from.

The major topics I want to address are Metastructural analysis for multimovement works the symphony here. The confusion about Mahlers progressive tonality i.e. that some of his works begin and end in different keys. I believe there is only one real tonic. This ties into the the previous two points but something Im calling a firstmovement bias in which the key of the first movement is attached to the title of a work. For example Beethovens Ninth in D minor despite that it ends in D major. This is more relevant for Mahler since as I mentioned many of his symphonies begin and end in different keys. The Seventh that Im working on is labeled as being in E minor yet I think that that completely misconstrues the structural goal of the Finale.

1043599,0,t3_2616iw,I dont think its so simple in nontonal languages to create prolongation through any of the four methods Straus mentions. If were speaking of prolongation in the sense of expectation we have to really define what expectation exists in the nontonal language were using. I think this has been challenging to define because there doesnt seem to be a consistent method of creatingachieving expectations across a majority of nontonal languages  the languages often becoming as unique as the composers that created them. Still I think its possible to have prolongation in posttonal music just not in the dated conceptual methods of common practice writing. Id be willing to consider gestures and motifs as examples of prolongation. These sorts of ideas generally act as dots we can connect as we listen. What we would have once called development in the Common Practice we could now look at as prolongation today  and I think we can use prolongation to speak about ideas that develop over the course of a piece because development is a sort of prolongation in and of itself. Thats where I would direct Strauss discussion. I think it makes more sense when we listen to postCPnontonal works. ,musictheory,chmwu4q,2,t5_2qrjj

In set music there is no tonic to dominant axis there is no implicit function like tonality expresses its largely nontertian in fact I dont even know if you could consider set harmony as tertian even if it was stacked in thirds unless the pitch set specifically was third centric and irregular scales which produce synthetic harmonies in relation to tonality.

1154729,0,t3_278y8p,Make em wait for that V chord! Try going between IV and I for a bit and then hit em with a high note on the V. Sometimes you can sing the V and play the IV chord in the nd inversion. Thats pretty cool and sounds kinda like a V chord with a tonic pedal to me. Example the chorus of Fleet Foxes  Helplessness Blues Or make em think its mixolydian for a while put the bVII in it. Have one verse that ends on the V and the next verse ends on the I. Then start the chorus on the IV and build up to a big ol VI. Or finish the chorus on a Vvi. At the end of the song play the chorus twice and finish VI.Sometimes folk singers write the music around old lyrics with forgotten melodies. This can lead to some bars having extra beats when you can hear the music is following the lyrics. This has since become a staple of the genre.

1315306,0,t3_294lst,I would consider myself advanced in the sense that there was a time where I used to write music that didnt achieve what I wanted and now I write music that achieves mostly what I want. Im at the point where I struggle to actually produce in higher quantities because Ive been too lazy to do anything other than wait for ideas to populate in my brain. To answer your question it gets better the more you study pieces that closely resemble your aesthetic. Theory as a curriculum doesnt actually prepare you to be a composer. This was my error in thinking for quite some time. Theory essentially includes the mechanics of a huge number of works  not all works use all the mechanics  and so we learn what those things are conceptually. They might be useful in some genres while entirely useless in others. Your challenge is to apply your knowledge of mechanics to the STUDY of the music that inspires you to write. You should go buy  works right now and put more effort into studying them than you ever did in your theory book. Find your favorite piece from theory and analyze it for everything. Mark it up. Make notes. Look for the smallest details AND the big picture stuff  take all of it in. Sketch ideas actual notes and rhythms as youre looking at your collection. Create an imitation of the piece and expand on it. Basically you need to build your own language from the ground up. Youre going to take at least a year minimum for this to even start feeling like progress. Eventually youll find your voice. Youll hear your ideas and know what chords and devices would make this happen. Youll start finding patterns and trademark sounds that just make you tingle and thats when youre going to start looking at it from a whole new perspective. Youll discover as I did that youre not really advanced as a composer. Youll have your weaknesses and youll have to figure out what to do to overcome them. But youll be at a different place in your writing than you were before. Trial and error never really stops but youll start being able to do more trial and error with higher level ideas than chords and melodies. tldr  The most advanced of composers really arent that different from you or anyone else here. Theyve chosen an aesthetic studied it using their accumulated knowledge of music theory and performance and then they applied it to their writing. ,musictheory,cihl7ik,1,t5_2qrjj

1360764,0,t1_cimsngl,I think tempo is a big deal as well. If most people oversimply the minor mode to mean sad they oversimplify quick tempos as being happy. I a minor mode piece at a somewhat sprightly tempo with quick staccato notes played somewhat delicately on the instruments is probably producing the effect youre talking about. In other words its sort of a combination of all the elements the harmony the tempo and the texture. None of these seem to be particularly intricate in their own domain but change any and you completely change the affect of the piece. ,musictheory,cimv0z3,2,t5_2qrjj
1366200,0,t3_29qb06,The idea of a tonal answer can be traced all the way back to modal counterpoint. Authentic and plagal modes were known to be related and if your subject was in the authentic mode it should be answered in the plagal mode. Real answers were discouraged since they would exceed the ambitus of a mode and confuse the mode of the piece since the two voices would have been considered to be in two different modes altogether. So thats where tonal answers come from. Im not Worlds Greatest Expert on sonata form or even reddits greatest expert but it grows more out of the idea of a binary form where the first half ends in a HC and then the second half ends in a PAC. Now lets make that binary form even bigger and turn it into sonata form! Someone can correct me if Im wrong about this. But what I mean is that the second theme on the dominant is like a drawnout half cadence. So no I dont see the concepts as particularly related.The major difference between the tonal answer and the secondary theme in the dominant is that the secondary theme does not necessarily have to be the same as or even similar to the primary theme. So it doesnt follow the same rules because it can be an entirely different melody. If its the same melody its more likely that the secondary theme would be more akin to a real answer. Tonal answers exist to keep the answer in the same key as the subject. In sonata form we want the second theme to definitively move away from the primary theme and into a totally new key. If it were going to follow any fugal rules it would be those of a real answer that moved into a new key. So it would be more like the exposition of the E minor fugue in Book  of the WTCthe answer just moves into B minor and does not come back to E minor until much later in the piecethan like the exposition of the C minor fugue in Book . ,musictheory,cinjjdk,2,t5_2qrjj
1368322,0,t1_cinicey,Im not discussing Baroque fugue im discussing response at the dominant in classical form Since it appears that I wasnt very clear for most of the respondants Im going to edit the questions topic. But while we are at it we could discuss fugual answer as well I know the difference between tonal and real answer in fugue. Real answer is easy its a simple transposition of the subjetc at the fifth thats why there is no need for dozens of rules like in tonal answer. For tonal answer I dont master the subject at all and its an euphemism. What I did understand is that if the subject is a generic IgtV in an authentic dominant move the tonal answer will be VgtI in a plagal move. Then there are all the cases like in the Renwick. For the Caplin there is his other book on google Classical Form A Theory of Formal Functions.In his model he states that the sentence  meassure form is protoyped by blocks of  measure each StatementResponseContinuationConclusion. The StatementResponse pattern can be of the harmonic type IgtV VgtI. This is the case that interest me.If you look well  there are a similarity of concepts between this StatementResponse pattern and tonal answer in fugue. But if tonal answer is well sudied I have no idea on how to properly do a StatementResponse or else very instinclively. Somewhere I want to link the two concepts and use the existing rules for the other as well.I hope its more clear ,musictheory,cint3d4,1,t5_2qrjj

Music doesnt. Id argue against that actually. Are songs that were popular  years ago still topping the charts today? Music has progressed just as fast as technology has IMO. We look at things in terms of composers vertically rather than dates horizontally so its tough to see progress. gt And like I said I feel like its mostly done...think of modern examples of things that are still pushing the boundaries of harmony and tonalityThe boundaries being those set in the th century which were already being pushed to their limit between Gesualdo Vincentino Bach Mozart and Beethoven In many ways the Classical and Romantic eras were a simplification of harmony rather than an exploration no one would argue that a Haydn string quartet is more complex harmonically than Gesualdo. I see sequences cadences modulations as repetitive structures that simplify organize harmony.No wonder Berlioz pioneered programmatic music  he probably thought its all been done before. Yeah of course it had but harmony is only one facet of composition. Thats why Id agree with you when you say that things today dont push the boundaries of harmonytonality but for the completely different reason that I think that pushing them isnt the point.I think were talking about two related issues here one that music education is focused on the common practice period without regard for modern practice and two that modern practice is focused primarily on manipulating color form rhythm etc. rather than harmony. IMO there are good reasons for both of those.,musictheory,cjguu6v,1,t5_2qrjj

1760724,0,t1_ck0z8i2,Are you familiar with the social history of colonization human trafficking and economic imbalance? The reason white Americans are not harmed by cultural borrowing is because they are on a global scale privileged  that is stereotypes and othering can do very little to disadvantage individuals and do not reinforce a social power structure. This is not true for people of color in Europe and North America nor is it true for people from Asia Africa Latin and South America the Pacific and other groups that lack relative social power to control the global perceptions around them and their culture. Again we need to move the conversation away from offense. Offense is an unimportant side effect of cultural harm. The true harm comes when for example stereotypes create a larger demand for Westerncreated art or music emulating a style rather than the original culture. It allows Western artists and musicians to shape the perception about a culture that they dont participate in. If you dont understand the longterm harm that can come out of decades perhaps centuries of exploitation on the part of North American and European colonial settlers Im not sure I can really help you.

I think its great and I dont really use it anymore but Im in music school and I can write scores and I write songs and Ive performed with grammy award winning musicians so I consider that website a huge help in my life as a musician.  It doesnt really have piano lessons but everything is laid out in keyboard form sort of but Im sure someone will post something specifically for keys in the meantime.  I learned to play keys which is actually the instrument Ive played most professionally and Im not actually very good at it but I learned through youtube tutorials of songs that I wanted to learn and just spent alot of time playing it.

1858749,0,t3_2fvh0q,On the one hand it sounds like youre talking about the way that dialogic form works we conceptualize musical experience in dialogue with generic norms. When the sounding music discords with those norms we look for a reason why i.e. dialogic dissonance is resolved through the act of interpretation. Sometimes we attribute agency to a compositional voice sometimes to a performers voice sometimes to human error. Sometimes to the universe itself I recall hearing a concert of new music once where I wasnt sure if a clicking box fan was an intentional part of the score or not. None of those strike me as categorically different from one another at least in a meaningful sense. A piece itself is a more specific set of norms that a given performance is in dialogue with. Geeze we say Carlos Kleiber really takes that at a fast clip and we attribute expressive meaning to it.On the other hand Im not sure I stick with you at the turn towards realitymultiverses. What about this idea strikes you as interesting? Usually when we find something interesting its because we sense a conflict between two things we thought were true or its because we think we have evidence for something that nobody else thinks is true.

Im sure any combination of allmajor or allminor chords will produce interesting results though. I wish my theory program expanded more on diatonic systems like this.

2144698,0,t1_clc5dkg,In this case if were talking about tonal music you wouldnt generally add the b because it is an avoid note in the scale.

2146450,0,t3_2jk0ew,Not an expert but I know part of the effect comes from a piece of music not necessarily having a conventional tonal center. If you listen to something like tenser moments in the TV show Lost it resembles the kind of thing uslavio illustrates with Pendercki. It just isnt using a traditional tonality that we consider pleasantits like a different language of musicand thus is jarring for us. Also note dramatic dynamic changes and accented beats coming out of nowhere.I would argue that the second a listener can make harmonic or melodic sense out of what he is listening to that unnerving fear effect is kind of lost. Take one of my favorites the cliched creepy piece Danse Macabre The beginning is just some shrieking strings that can be jarring. But then we get a mournful melody that might invoke imagery of scary stuff but isnt really scary itself because we can make sense of it.I would argue that the best scary music bridges this well it knows when to create extreme jarring tension and when to lets us breathe with something less chaotic. ,musictheory,clcnvd7,4,t5_2qrjj

Youll often see chords in root position the  of the chord in the bass first inversion the  of the chord in the bass second inversion the  of the chord in the bass and so on.Depending on the style youre playing in it may also be kosher to play parts of a substitute chord so for example you could choose to play a bass line of D  Db  C under a Dm  G  C type of progression using a tritone substitution for the G chord which is a common substitution in jazz.Pedal tones are also a nice way to break out of the chord tone box sometimes playing one sustained note under a shifting progression of chords. The root of the dominant chord under a pattern like iiiviiiV works really well or the tonic over some other excursion... really there are a lot of options. The solid ground a pedal tone gives you can be a great anchor from which to go outside if your chosen style permits such a thing.Mind you Im coming at this mostly from the viewpoint of a performing jazz musician so Im sure Im living in a bit of a box.

When you talk about someone explaining the rules to someone whos looking for answers the fact is that theyve already been explained to them usually in the form of reading them in a textbook. Parroting the same information that someone already read in their textbook isnt going to help them much at this point because theyve already heard it.The point of the exercises is that they assist you in internalizing those rules. By doing the exercises and being shown exactly what youre doing wrong at that particular moment you are being shown specifically what it is about the material that you dont understand. If  someone handed their homework into the teacher and the teacher simply said okay go read page  in your textbook again then that teacher would be decisively unhelpful. Saying You have parallel fifths going from the fifth to the sixth measure and thats wrong because  is much more helpful because it points out exactly what youre doing wrong and allows you to say hey I messed up there I guess I need to brush up on these specific rules to fix my specific problem.Im not saying you guys are obligated to point out answers or anything but the idea that someone would just parrot textbook rules and definitions to someone looking for critique and improvement on their specific questions is just silly.,musictheory,cmh4ws4,8,t5_2qrjj

2583492,0,t3_2padve,Context is everything. Sometimes context is cleverly hidden. If the person writing the chord progression is clever enough it may take several romannumeral analyses before you find the correct one. You may find out that for entire keys and sections you never see the I chord. It can be like solving a crossword puzzle. Sometimes there is only one right answer but it looks so insanely counterintuitive. That said you have to know what the true analysis is if you want to be able to choose the best chord scales to play for each change. Schenkerian analysis is similar but it only goes so far. You will want more knowledge about what chord changes and scales are typical for jazz.Counterpoint knowledge will help a lot but dont worry too much about interval distances. Think more about the available notes in the chord. Think about contrary motion when leaps are large. You can make leaps that imply other chords but you have to play the available chord tones on the strong beats. Weak beats can be just about any note that you want it to be. The more you push that while still abiding by what you are allowed to play on the strong beats the more you can push the envelope in an improv setting. You can use that knowledge to make your performance as textbook as you want or you can use it to viciously abuse approach tones like you caught them breaking into your apartment.As far as parallel perfect intervals are concerned you dont really need to worry about that in jazz.

But I think there are some schools that will take the time to be a little more relevant in their music history classes so it could be worth it for you. ,musictheory,cnh361k,2,t5_2qrjj

2764145,0,t3_2rnbz1,A little late to the discussion. At the professional level there remains a gender imbalance across the academic music disciplines and throughout the academy. This is easier to understand when you read about how having children is a career benefit to men and a career detriment to women. At the graduate level there are more men than women in theory but there are more women than men in musicology. If these werent separate disciplines the imbalance would look a lot different. And none of the current students or younger professionals were asked whether they should be different disciplines. So it seems to me that this is much more about the challenges to women creating and sustaining careers in the academy than whether music theory remains an inherently sexist field. Though even if the field has abandoned some of its most antiquated ideas it surely has its share of sexist people.,musictheory,cni9tg6,6,t5_2qrjj

2935098,0,t3_2tqmob,I think this is a fascinating topic as somebody whos interested in music melody especially but never really developed a taste for music beyond pop. Its not a standards thing because I tend to like random melodies here and there across the whole spectrum of pop. Interestingly changing one note in a melody can render it completely lifeless to me.  Broad explanations like its minor its slow and dreary etc dont satisfy me since I tend to enjoy the particular melody itself rather than the overall aesthetics of it. The bottom line is as others are saying is that its a personal thing. This doesnt have to be a deadend answer though you can try to analyze what you personally like in a melody. I certainly havent cracked the code yet but Ive picked up on a few trends in my favorite melodies. Im a sucker for semitone intervals especially the one formed by the major th and the root. Melodies that pivot around these two notes tend to sound good to me although its such a common thing that they can easily end up sounding boring and unoriginal. This fits more into harmony than melody but I also love transitions from a major chord to its minor counterpart. Melodies that span a large interval tend to do more for me as well..,musictheory,co1qeel,1,t5_2qrjj

3068976,0,t3_2vai2r,Its not as weird as it seems but itll be a lot easier to think of it in flat keys rather than sharp keys. So lets look at it like thisEmEbBbDAbEbCmAbGThe progression can basically be split into two halves the first in Bb major and the second in Eb majorBbivIVIIII EbIVIviIVIIINow the only chords that arent diatonic to these keys are the III chords and the iv chord. The III are easily explained III or III chords are used pretty often to tonicize the relative minor of the key youre in. If you play the first four chords of the progression and then land on G minor for instance it would sound very resolved. To avoid this resolution because boooooring am I right? they jump to Eb major by way of a IVI move which is also very common. I should mention that changing to the key a fourth up is another very common move. That G at the end is the same thing it wants to resolve to Cm but RHCP doesnt want it to be that easy so they use the fact that Em is the relative major of G to connect the two. The fact that these two chords are so distant from the home keys of Bb and Eb makes the move very jarring but the way the Em resolves down to Eb keeps it from being TOO jarring.Okay so what about the iv chord? Well in jazz we have something called chromatic approach which means you can put any weirdass chord you want in your progression and if it resolves up or down by a semitone to a chord that makes sense in the home key then itll still sound nice. I think thats pretty much whats happening here.,musictheory,cog3gme,2,t5_2qrjj

Then the F goes to G and the AC move down to GB to make the dominant or something like that this would actually just make it a V chord... I forget what I first heard when I wrote this but you can make it work either way. ii is a typical predominant chord in classical music I find that it is far richer in color than the ii variant perhaps because it offers the option of doing ii dim viiV I V in a particularly smooth way. If you want an even more colorful predominant try using Fr this is the only aug  chord available to you because the melody is on D .

When one string is vibrating it affects all the others they are all attached to the same piece of wood after all.  The strings that resonate the strongest with the plucked note will usually be vibrating in pitch with the original note even though they are not tuned to the same note. Sort of like when you hit a harmonic at the th fret.When you do that youre limiting the vibration of the string to a specific vibrational mode the th specifically by touching a node of that mode making it impossible for any others to occur google vibrational modes for more information on that.

3806475,0,t3_340dvm,Just finishing up a graduate level ear training class. This prof makes us sing solfedge every class and I find it incredibly useful. Intervals are easier to hear and even more importantly it shows function of chords easily. For the first  of the semester we used moveable do which means the root Do changes relative to the key center. When we got into mediant relationships and secondary dominant chords we would have to change the key of our solfedge so that every dominant leading chord would sing Soh ti re fa so that we would hear the VI relationships in the chord changes. For modes and altered scales wed keep the root on Do and sing the altered notes as accidentals. Ex a Lydian scale would be Do re mi Fi soh la ti do. Then in atonal music we use fixed do which means that the note C is always Do. No matter what is happening C is Do and the other noted have their fixed place. The reason for this is that post tonal music doesnt have a key center whatsoever so its easier to keep it all the same. We had to sing tests on stuff like Stravinsky hindimeth Webern and Schoenberg. Theres a fair chance that I may be teaching these courses to undergraduates starting in the next few years and if thats the case I will absolutely use this method. I think its the most effective way to develop solid ear training. ,musictheory,cqq62i3,2,t5_2qrjj

It can help you economize scales because you are thinking okay I play every note just like the last scale except now I make one slight little change. Rather than memorizing every single note. ,musictheory,cqtgdhc,2,t5_2qrjj

3908779,0,t3_355wsr,Imo the ideas should almost always be ideas of sounds you want or think of. That is how one should compose. Theory is naming those sounds and organizing them so that you can find them easily when you want them. Knowing theory in strictly written form is not useful so much. No more than knowing the words and combinations of cooking ingredients without ever having tasted them is useful for being a cook. You want to learn the theory by sound. If you do that you might come across new sounds you never thought of and those become part of your arsenal. But theory imo should never be sort of a way to reason yourself into compositions. It should not dictate composition. It is how to find the sounds you want to hear. So trial and error if you mean hunting for the notes you want to hear is fine. If you mean random rolling the dice until you find something you like that might end up decent from time to time but thats not real composition imo. Neither is using chords because a book says it is common. What you want to do is compose with the sounds you want to hear. The ideas come from you. Not random luck and not some algorithm or theoretical concept. ,musictheory,cr1u3hn,1,t5_2qrjj

The gear as a whole represents all the notes in a scale and no matter which way you turn it it is the same gear.  Now imagine cutting the gear and laying it out flat.  Depending on where you make the cut the gear will have a different pattern using the above example it could be big small smallsmall small bigsmall big small.  Basically using traditional modes each key will use the same notes the space between each note either whole or half step represents the teeth.

For example being able to agree on what constitutes a major or minor chord is vital to analysis and if two people disagree on this discussion of the terms would be important. More importantly arguing over distinctions is not pointless. The question is this type two or type three? forces you to think about the overall structure of the piece. As a clearer example the question What is a recapitulation? makes you think about the nature of repeats. You realize there is a difference between simply repeating material and a entire recapitulation of a section. Its untrue that this kind of thinking doesnt say anything about the music. Youre thinking about what it means to be a recapitulation in music in general and you can then apply that to the specific piece.  In context of sonata types talking about the difference between a type  and  means youre thinking about what sonatas are to begin with.So its not pointless its subtle. ,musictheory,cs4v4jt,1,t5_2qrjj

4457022,0,t3_3c40ry,There are some great comments here explaining th chords.  Although I can understand how some of these comments may be a bit of information overload and take a while to digest. Im going to try my best to make a simplified version of th chords.Ok think of Chord symbols as a recipe of notes.   These recipes are telling you what notes of a scale to play.  The very basic foundation of chords is the Triad.  Keeping things simple lets just focus on  triads Major and Minor.  Major triads contain the  of the major scale.Minor triads contain the b of the major scale.Going back to the recipe analogy think of the Triad as the basic Cake you want to make.  Vanilla cake Major or Chocolate cake minorth chords along with th th and th chords are basically Chord extensions. These extensions dont change what kind of triad cake you have.  Think of extensions like icing on the cake.For example a minor triad still functions as a minor chord regardless of whether it has a th or th extension on it.  Or in other words a Chocolate cake is still a chocolate cake whether it has strawberry icing or mint icing.  So go ahead and put a  on top of a major triad.  you have a major th.  Same cake different icing.  Same goes for putting the b on top of the minor triad same cake different icing.   Dominate ths can be a bit confusing when first trying to understand them.  The recipe for a Dominate th is a major triad  with a b on top.  Why the b?  Because the b creates this tension called a tritone that wants to pull to the I chord.  Because of this Dominate ths should be considered a separate type of cake.  I dunno... Coconut cake.  So the recipe for this new cake dominate th is b yes you can put extensions on top of this one  ths ths and ths  and it still functions like a dominate th or Coconut cake  if you will. Long story short.Major Triad       Major th th th or th ......  notated as CMAJ CMinor Triad  b     minor th th th or th ....  notated as Cmin CMajor Triad and b  th th or th  Dominate th th th or th. ... notated as C CdomHope that helps...Oh and stay away from Major  and Dom  chords right now.

4685467,0,t1_ctl2vk7,I could certainly be swayed on this and its not that Im denying that there are tonal elements in the piece. The opening and closing cadences are to b minor by ostensibly I was more referring to whether or not those cadences really control a tonality of the whole piece which as far as I see it right now they dont strictly do that as in a clearly tonal piece. But controlling pitches or pitch centers dont necessarily make a piece tonal do they? In the sonata I would personally say that the chromaticism is extended enough that this isnt really tonal music through and through at least not in the traditional sense and thus its being actually in a key is tentative. The form of the piece isnt an elimination of tradition entirely certainly and the controlling pitches are pretty well connected to sonata form. But its hard for me to see this as a clearly tonal piece when so much of the harmonic syntax diverts from tonal practices. I would be fine saying This piece is a b minor piece. But I dont think that necessarily defines the whole piece as tonal. ,musictheory,ctl5cr1,1,t5_2qrjj
4707004,0,t3_3fdzra,Yes.  Absolute pitch is the ability to identify a note independently of other notes based on its unique qualities.  So if you are identifying Middle C on the piano because it has a certain brightness  timbre  Middle Cness then that is a type of absolute pitch identification.  At the highest levels of absolute pitch there are people who can identify the note of a buzzing insect or car horn instantly.  But you dont need to be at that elite level to develop some absolute pitch recognition ability.Relative pitch is the ability to hear the qualities of a note in the context of some sort of culturally defined note system.  So hearing the first  notes of Mary Had a Little Lamb in any key and determining that you are probably hearing Mi Re Do Re Mi Mi Mi would indicate a sense of relative pitch.  You dont need to know the solfge though some people would just hear that Jingle Bells and Mary Had a Little Lamb have the same starting point because they have developed relative pitch over time.,musictheory,ctnuta4,3,t5_2qrjj

4784505,0,t3_3gey2j,Just like how Dm G is a iiV in the key of C meaning youd use D dorian and G mixolydian which are just modes of C major anyway Em A is a iiV in the key of D.  So youd use E dorian and A mixolydian which are modes of D major.  After that the theory can get pretty deep.Lets pretend we have a iiVI in C so Dm G Cmaj.  Now Im gonna change the Dm to a D to change the ii to a VV.  It still has the same function within the big context but now its just a little bit bigger of a pull towards the V G.  Now Ill take that G make it a tritone sub so that now I have Db.  And really all youre doing when you use a tritone sub is using all the alterations rather than extensions.  Db is really the same as GaltDb keep that in mind for the scale Im gonna tell you to use later.  So now that I have that Db Ill add a ii to that V in the key that its now in which gives me Abm Db leading to Cmaj but you cant forget about that D that precedes it.  So the D Abm D Cmaj is really just a convoluted iiVI in the key of C.So now if it actually were still just a iiVI in C youd use D dorian over the Dm and G mixolydian over the G.  So now that its D instead of Dm you have to change the F to an F which gives you D mixolydian.  If youve got the tritone sub of G youre basically adding in all the alterations so you could use either Db mixolydian or G altered dominant which is the th mode of Ab melodic minor.  And then of course C major for the Cmaj chord.,musictheory,ctxmkvx,6,t5_2qrjj

5042477,0,t3_3jyd0i,Yes iii is super super rare in Baroque and Classical harmony actually. Like if you look at it from purely a statistical perspective without trying to determine any kind of reason historical scientific or otherwise it is just a rare chord. So if you are trying to emulate a Baroque or Classical style you should avoid it too.If you want to know why it was avoided one reason is that for bass lines using scaledegree  it was preferred to have a I chord above that bass note. This is documented in many many treatises on keyboard playing composition and music theory throughout the th th and th centuries.One time iii is used is to harmonize scaledegree  in the melody when it continues to descend to scaledegree . As you probably know scaledegree  is the leading tone and typically likes to move back up to . But harmonizing scaledegree  with a iii chord turns the leading tone into a stable note since its the top note of a perfect fifth with the bass scaledegree . This means it can descend to  instead of moving back up to . Getting less historical and more purely theoretical a.k.a. kind of madeup stuff here iii instead sounds just like a I chord with a wrong note. Its kind of a weirdsounding chord because as someone else mentioned it has kind of a tonic function since it includes scaledegrees  and  but it also has a bit of dominant function as well since it also contains scaledegrees  and . imo and this is just opinion its this dual function in it that makes it sound unusual or even wrong in some contexts and causes composers to avoid using it.Traditionally III in minor is basically a nonexistent chord which is often better understood as a V chord that substitutes scaledegree  for scaledegree . I say that because III is used exactly like a V chord is used in virtually every example of it in BaroqueClassical music.,musictheory,cutt5jf,3,t5_2qrjj

This is the NORMAL UNSYNCOPATED natural place for pulses. Accent notes and some rhythmic notation will change the emphasis as can the rhythms in the measure. i.e. a long not carries a more of an emphasis than a short note. Its just a general convention as to the natural feel. But in general use the main purpose for the time signature is to make reading easier. Its purpose is to give you an organized background or matrix of a general feel for the piece and it gives the reader a way of counting the rhythms if count the rhythm with the rhythmic syllables based upon the time signature. As to the sound the the frequency of the pulse relative to the recurring quarter note will give you longer measures. This helps to create different phrasings.  would have longer phrasings and this would make a  bar phrase longer than a  bar phrase in a  measures. This also can be changed by the way you write your music on paper but we are talking about the general anld by convention the most normal way music is written and notated.

If the implied harmony is more complex than these progressions transposing the subject will be very hard to do while keeping the harmony stylistically correct.Rhythm consisting of two adjacent note values e.g. eighths and sixteenths or quarters and eighths. An important part of Baroque counterpoint is the idea of motor rhythm this is when the fastest note value of the piece is constantly present between the combined parts. By using two adjacent note values it will allow the multiple voices to alternate pleasingly between faster and slower rhythms.Start on e or .

Although Equal temperament made made modulations and chord progressions possible they still studied the OLD WAY and worked on ways to combine the two.

Simple melody in modal settings...Only the Lydian and the Ionic have leading tones. The rest of the modes have a th degree tone a whole step below the tonic andthus are not leading tones. You would have to use musica ficta and this came more in the Renaissance than the periods in the context of  species counterpoint. Can you write a new C.F that has a leading tone? Sure. Why not but that is not what the conventions of the of species were about.the context of my response is also in reply to the statement that one of the voices HAD to have a leading tone and it could be in either voice. Well sure you could write one today that did but the rules of counterpoint as described by Fux does not have functional cadences.

In your case as a guitar player of the four chord song variety you will probably be using nonfunctional harmony. So if you want something to be in a key pick chords from the key you want to be in and arrange them so that the tonic chord is clearly heard as the tonic.Honestly there are no rules in the four chord song system.

OP asked a question. From my experience in music I know that for programming music since the very beginning I never used theory. And I still program the same fuckin way I ever did. During that time I learned how to become a strong instrumentalist. That required me to learn some theory because it needs me to play collections of notes on a whim within milliseconds of thinking it and playig it within milliseconds of precision of timing. So I learned theory for that. Things I still to this day dont use on my daw. You can oretend I said otherwise which anyone could clearly see is false by reading the comment history if you want to. Im just making that statement. Idk why youd fucking stick your retarded nose in it because whatever you think doesnt make a lick of difference. If you think my music sucks ok well I sill dont use theory to make it and I still think my music is amazing. You think jimi hendrix used theory and beethoven and you or whatever the fuck and ok fine I dont give a shit I still dont use theory when I program into my daw.  Its so fucking ridiculous for you to even argue at all about what I do that I cant find the proper words to express to you how fucking incredibky stupid that is. And even now youre saying dumb shit like I admited earlier to usin theory to program. I didnt say anything of the sort and I didnt insinuate anything of the sort because I just dont use theory to program. Its not fuckin rocket science. Its not a difficult concept. I imagine the sound of notes in my mind and click and drag until I hit the right one. I dont think about what key im in when I stopped on a C or D whether I built a major chord or minor chord. Whether the root is onlymon the bass or what. I never think any of that. I click and drag when it gets to the sound im thinking I stop. Its very fast.

6383736,0,t1_czersv2,Well of course Ragtime and Blues led to jazz but so did European classical music. I consider Rock and Rolland especially Ragtime to be different styles than Jazz. Related of course but very distinct styles. I doubt if you played a Joplin Rag for any musician today that they would call it jazz. Almost all music is evolved from some kind of earlier music. But just like evolution you need to draw some lines between species. You are obviously very jazzcentric which is not a bad thing as shown by your statement its kind of like how C Cmaj C etc. are simply many names for the same thing. To me and many nonjazz musicians they are NOT the same thing. Styles are a continuoum but just saying that its all jazz does a disservice to all of the differences. I did like the quip about bluegrass but that doesnt really address the fact that it is a very distinct style that was born completely in America and is certainly not jazz although very similar in many respects.,musictheory,czf9g90,1,t5_2qrjj

If I had a dollar for every assignment I erased or tore up....!If you really want to study part writing I say start where all the composers did after the Renaissance and that is with Fuxs Steps to Parnassus. Its a dialectic  and some find it a bit tedious but I find it an enjoyable way to learn how to write contrapuntal melodies and when you break it down that is what part writing actually is. The reason that parallel fifths and octaves are forbidden it that they waste a voice.  In a chorale if these happen they are no longer  distinct parts! I found out that when I started to approach the part writing as counterpoint a lot of things were cleared up.

Any reason behind bVII over domVII?Sorry I think youre still very very very confused.  Lets see if we can clear this up.Say youre in C which is the easiest tonic to think about for most people.  The bVII is the major chord built on the b of the scale  so Bb major.  That chord is spelled Bb D F.  I have never ever seen domVII written so I dont know what youre talking about there.  If you mean bVIIdom thats a different chord that would be a Bb chord spelled Bb D F Ab.  If you have Bb major the bVII going to Eb major which is the bIII you might as well play Bb but I didnt actually have the bVII going to bIII I think.  Now why do I call it bVII over simply VII?  Because I find VII to be too ambiguous.  I have no idea if Im in major or minor and frankly I dont care so I use bVII to refer to the major chord built on the b  thats the Bb when the tonic is C  and viio to refer to the diminished chord built on the   thats the B when the tonic is C.  And I used bvii to refer to the minor chord built on the b which is common in the phrygian mode.So to recap.  Were in C.  bVII is Bb major.  bvii is Bb minor.  viio is B diminished.,musictheory,czy0f9x,1,t5_2qrjj

Frets would be x. Thats a high F with the p G bumped up a whole step to a A making it add. Lines for both chords was reference to the melody  harmony  only other thing Ive written for them. Sorry I worded it poorly. gt and no A in the second chord... also if the A is in the second chord not the firstThe voicing for the second chord from lowest to highest is D G C E A or x.

6717725,0,t3_47mjqn,In pretty much all classical music and a good deal of pop the V chord in minor songs is major as it creates a much stronger and more functional resolution than the minor v chord.  For that reason the th scale degree of natural minor is often raised which creates the harmonic minor scale.  The major V chord in minor tunes is also the norm in jazz but its often dealt with differently... not using harmonic minor.Often the th will be raised along the th so that melodies avoid the awkward augmented nd sounds the same as a minor rd that would otherwise occur between the minor th and major th.  This creates the melodic minor scale.I think its best to think of minor keys is as one changeable scale.

A C E ltgt G E C i.e. C E GB D F A ltgt F D B G i.e. G B D Fgt but this inverse function of diatonic minor is sometimes lost... especially with the cpp tendency to somewhat artificially force major idioms on minor through the use of harmonic minoragreed. i kind of got really into inverting cpp ascending major harmonies into the descending minor equivalent. schoenberg got me thinking about it when i was reading his writing on the the descending and ascending form of the minor scale. decided to see how far i could take the idea.its crazy how much functional harmony is based on one pitch ascending a semitone. so i looked at the descending equivalent. i.e. th st in major to th  th in minor.  minor and major chords have the same intervals but in the opposite direction so i treated the th of the minor tonic triad like the st of the major tonic triadcreated the equivalent of authenticdecepetive cadences. then placed it artificially in other locations in the scale like secondary dominants. even went the other way and created a melodic major scale. lol            ,musictheory,d1kucdl,1,t5_2qrjj

In earlier times there were special rules for what you should or shouldnt do with particular tones and the fifth was one of the most restricted. Modern music and jazz often say you can choose to disregard those old conventions paying more attention to what you believe sounds best for what you are trying to achieve. Chords which include a fifth will invariably have a stronger sound than those without so my main concern would be about how well the two types sit alongside each other. You can achieve some good effects simply by playing an arrangement using chords without fifths then playing it again using different voicings that now do include fifths.,musictheory,d1p3g9u,4,t5_2qrjj

Lets do some quick calculations here.The idea is to do  over  but you dont actually need to get those exactly because you cant hear the difference anyway.  Lets say the  note is at  Hz for ease of computation which is one cycle every  samples  samplessecond.  The other note is at approximately . Hz which is one cycle every approximately . samples.  Thats a difference of about  samples per cycle which is obviously doable.  You may have issues with less than that and even so your ear has quite the capacity.What does  samples mean?  Well a sample cycle is  Hz about A while a sample cycle is about  Hz about a quarter semitone above B.  You can hear those notes over a phone with its much shittier bitrate and yet the difference in samples per cycle is the same as for a Pythagorean comma at  Hz.Now heres where bitrate actually matters when the difference become subsample.  What if the ratio is actually ?  Can that be heard?  Thats  parts in a million about.  You know what?  Try it  I cant hear a difference but I think you could have much better bitrate and you still couldnt.  The interesting thing here is the beats  whether youll get these depends on the float precision but  in a million is definitely within that.  The beats will still happen even with a shitty bitrate!  They will just take a really long time.  I just tried  a factor of  smaller numbers so  parts in a million or so and the beats are many seconds long but still audible.  I used a  Hz base frequency so its about  seconds per beat.  This will happen even with a shitty bitrate because whats happening is that two waves are going out of alignment.  They start out aligned and have constructive interference but at halfway through the cycle they will be antialigned and have destructive interference.

7176222,0,t1_d1ttxhr,Yes I did. I explained the various degrees and how tuning and detuning affected the overtone to hide most of the tonal overtones and pointed out that the main reason it did not affect the tones and harmony is because of its detuning to do so and mostly because of the short duration of  the drum tones in question. And I did it without making any statements that were universally true when there are obvious exceptions to another view point. If you read carefully my post you would have seen that agreed with the exceptions but I addressed your statements that were not universally true and pointed them out. AND I kept in the context of the question at hand. Can you truthfully say the same? Or will I get another off topic contextual changing retort or schoolyard argument? As I have said before you are not totally unknowing but what is it that prevents you from seeing that your personal opinion is the ONLY opinion and you bully posters that dont know any better saying that they are wrong because they disagree with your opinion? Did you even notice that I explained some of the things you were fuzzy on and pointed out how the non tonal sound of the drum was accomplished by hiding the very things that you were saying was not even possible? Really A wise man once told me to pay attention to what hothead know it alls accuse you of as that is what they are afraid people will see in them! NOTHING is  true in music. There are always exceptions so try to remember when ever you make statements like that you are wrong even if you are  right. If you want to do music analysis you have to learn that there are more than one way to explain everything. To insist that things are only one way is a sign of ignorance. Take which parts of this fits you and apply the rest to those that are guilty of the same.

Can you give the figures youre using?Im going by the harmonic series of F which contains notes close to equal tempered C and A rd and th harmonics and also one close to E albeit way up at th harmonic. The harmonic series of E does not contain a note anywhere near A and the nearest one to C is up at the th harmonic.But I think I agree the reason the minor triad works is not down to a virtual acoustic root anyhow F or the more dubious E.  I think we actually accept A as the aural root because its supported by its th E.  Its the C that makes it ambiguous by suggesting itself as a weak alternative root of the CE major rd.  This seems to be supported by the sound of the chord in st inversion where C seems to exert a stronger rival claim to root status still not quite winning.  At least the chord is not the homogeneous entity presented by the major triad which blends easily into one sound.  The minor triad forces us to hear it as a mix of tones which is where its complexity arises.,musictheory,d2xmtb2,1,t5_2qrjj

Then the bottom number tells you how to notate the duration of one beat or pulse. So  would mean that there are four beats in the measure or four basic pulses. so you would count     over and over again. If you want to make simple rhythms change the  into a rest and you have    which would be played when you count the number and have a silence wen you have a rest. this is basic writing using only two elements to describe the way the notes are arranged and two different notes to play. One note is a sound and another note is no sound. For  its the same thing but you only cound to three.       and over and over. This is the starting place. Then you can add eighth notes as the pulse. They are usually labeled with a  sign which is called AND and you do the same things and play where there is a note and dont when there is a rest. The rest is just variations on how you compose the two numbers for the pulse and the rest and then the different ways that you can sub divide the beat. Practice it with the quarters and eight notes and try it with the rh notes and we can expand from there. LJSem ,musictheory,d32bx4z,-2,t5_2qrjj

7680930,0,t3_4kh8rx,In equal temperament there are no differences between individual notes or between keys or scales of the same type.Keys are chosen according to practical instrumental factors including voice as mentioned.  Mainly to do with range but occasionally to do with specific sonorities peculiar to an instrument.  Eg any guitarist will tell you that the key of G major is totally different from Ab major.  It certainly feels different and on an acoustic instrument resonances in the body of the instrument! may mean they actually sound different.  But tune the guitar down a semitone and the guitarist may then be confused.  Now the concert key of G major will feel and look like Ab major.  And yet it will sound precisely the same as before.  Admittedly there is an effect caused by fretting strings because hands gripping the neck will reduce some of the vibrations in the wood  so open strings might naturally sustain longer than fretted ones.  But then hands tend to be touching the neck somewhere in any case so that effect should average out.The human body may also be sensitive to resonances at particular frequencies but this would vary from person to person.  A bass pitch that vibrates someones rib cage might not affect the next person the same way.  The feel of middle C in one persons throat head or chest will be different in the next person.IOW many musicians and singers will insist that different keys have different characters but thats all down to the instrument they play not to any inherent quality in the pitches themselves ie. any quality common to any instrument.,musictheory,d3f9x8m,1,t5_2qrjj

Occasionally we also need double sharps or double flats but not in standard major scales.Thing is theres only  positions  sounds for those  possible names.  The same sound with two different names is called enharmonic.  So B sounds the same as C but the rule for any scale is we need one of each note letter and position on the staff.  So if we have a C major scale we already have a C so we need to call the th note B.  Its really the same thing as the difference between say Ab and G.  Ab occurs in the major scales of Eb Ab Db Gb and Cb  because they already have a G or Gb.

So if E is perceived as the central pitch and there are some other notes floating around it in the context of a piece of music then the intervallic distance between those other notes and the center is what determines mode.gtThen why does Maj chord sound best over Lydian mode?I dont see how that controverts anything Ive said. Maj is an available extended sonority within the mode but it is by no means the only one. Besides music is not a contest to see who or what is the best. Freewill by Rush seems to get along just fine without Maj chords. The Snuff Wife jig seems to get along fine with just triads as accompaniment. And playing anything close to an eleventh chord would get you some sour looks at a session.My point here is that there needs to be a harmonic motion in order to determine whether something is really at the center. Yeah use a Maj chord if you want but recognize that it is just one chord in a constellation of other tonally available chords to the lydian mode. I can see a chord loops like G Fmaj II I working provided you can maintain the tonality. C F V I would also work. You cant go off of chord progressions though. Randy Newmans Strange Things uses a chord progression that you might think is lydian I II V. However its really I VV V. If you dont understand tonality modality and chromaticism interact youre likely going to make some egregious errors in your concept of pitch relations.,musictheory,d5v44i8,5,t5_2qrjj

8532549,0,t3_4wm8fa,This is how I would think of itThe first two examples are just quarter note triplets but instead of thinking them as group of  Evans phrases them as groups of  more like typical jazz phrasing. The reason why it sounds so floaty is because playing like this shifts the strong and weak beats within the triplets and also shifts Evans choice of notes.Ive heard this technique called playing  over  or triplet swing pulse.Its tough to write down on reddit but this technique looks something like this while you may typically play those triplets like so |||||Evans plays and thinks of them like this     |||||Or this if you prefer|||||Evans also builds on this rhythmic shift and adds embellishments and shorter rhythmic figures which further contributes to the feeling that hes floating over the rhythmic basis of the tune.Edit by the way the rhythm section on Israel is doing the same thing on the first  choruses. While Evans improvises over a typical quarter note pulse the rhythmic section is playing over a triplet quarter or half note depending on how you think of it pulse.Edit  a good way to get a feel for it would be to practice playing bebop scales in triplets with a metronome. Bebop scales naturally fall on the right beats and you can loop them forever theyre perfect for this exercise.

8585638,0,t1_d6eptuk,Predominants as the name suggests come before dominants in a functional progression. Youll probably want to do a little research into functionality in music for a full explanation but heres the TLDR versionFunctionality in music is the idea that every pitch has a certain role or certain roles with respect to a key that is they have a diatonic function. The most important of these are the tonic which sounds safe resolved and like a home note the dominant which sounds tense and wants to resolve to a tonic and the predominant which is sort of in between the two in terms of tension but wants to be followed by a dominant.The rules can get a little complicated and dont have to be followed at all if you want to write what they call nonfunctional music but as a general rule of thumb the I chord and the i chord if youre in a minor key is tonic the V and viio chords as well as the bVII and SubV are dominant and both ii and IV are predominant as well as iio and iv. Unfortunately the matter gets even more confusing because dominant can also be used to refer to the V chord exclusively with the viio chord being called a leadingtone chord and predominant can also be used to refer to the IV chord exclusively with the ii chord being called a supertonic.So a secondary predominant is any chord that wants to go to its relative secondary dominant. Say were in the key of C and we see the progression    Cmaj  Em  Gm  C  Fmaj  Am  D GWell Cmaj is yout I chord your tonic Em is your iii chord kind of a tonicextension Fmaj is your IV chord your predominant and G is your V chord your dominant chord but what about all those other chords which arent diatonic to the key of C major? Well D is the V chord of the G that it precedes so we call that a secondary dominant and would notate it as VV ie the dominant chord of the key which is a fifth away from C major. Well what about that Am? If the D came from the key of G major could the Am be coming from there as well? It is indeed! Am is the ii chord in the key of G major so wed refer to it as a secondary predominant or secondary supertonic and would notate it as iiV.Can you work out whats happening with regards to the Gm and C?,musictheory,d6esj5e,2,t5_2qrjj

8659128,0,t3_4y5wvl,Dont think about tonality! start with a melodic motif. Work on development. Start with simple development techniques like inversion elongation retrograde fragmentation and combining all of the different things you can think of with just melodic shapes. Arrange your notes into simple forms like aaba aabb and just work on putting together a melodic phrase. At first you may have very sterile and uninteresting melodies that just meander but you will be having correctly constructed melodies of some sort or another. As you get used to thinking melody you can then think tonic and dominant phrases to inject tonality. Be sure to sing your melodies and play them but singing is important as it trains your inner ear. This should get you started. If you cant get started with a motif trace a shape on a stave that you see in a picture or at random and work with that for a while and you will start to get a feel for melody. You have to jump in and just think melody. In my newly revived Blog at ltelementmusic.comgt I have just posted an overview of the basic concepts of music. Pay attention to highlow and Rhythm and beat. This is a very rudimentary intro that will be followed up with details of how to use them for things like composing melodies etc but if you contact me through a contact box on the site I will respond with some exercises that use the basic concepts to create melodies that I have used to help teach composing melodies.

8754958,0,t1_d6zzxed,Interval names give their names to chords via the most significant interval in the chord.  So major and minor chords are differentiated by their rd major or minor accordingly because they both have a perfect th.  No need to refer to scales at all btw.  Chords can be understood wholly from interval theory and terminology independently of scales.  You can think of both chords and scales as things which are built from intervals and which get their names from their significant intervals.  Major and minor simply mean bigger and smaller and refer to intervals which come in two common sizes nds rd ths and ths only as theghostofjfkfuture explains.When it comes to chord symbols however they follow a slightly confusing shorthand although it does have a practical logic.  In chord symbol language the perfect th and major rd are taken as default.  So we can use a simple letter C to stand for a C major chord with major rd E and perfect th G.  When we want a C minor chord we just add m to indicate the minor smaller rd.When it comes to ths its the smaller th that is taken as standard because its more common.  I.e. a major th is  semitones from the root while a minor th is  semitones.  In a diatonic scale there are  of the latter and only  of the former.  So a plain number  refers to the smaller th and we use maj to indicate the rarer major th.  This makes for a very economical system with the more common chord types having the shorter namesC  C major triad plus minor th.  Both default. Commonest permutation of rd and th. C E G Bb. Known as a dominant th type because its derivation is from the V or dominant degree of a scale.Cm  C minor triad plus minor th. m refers to the rd not the th which is normal minor. C Eb G BbCmaj  C major triad plus major th.  maj refers to the th not the rd which is normal major. C E G BCmmaj  C minor triad plus major th.  Both the rd and th are altered from the normal defaults so we need both m and maj.  C Eb G B.  This is the rarest permutation.All four have a perfect th G which we take for granted.  When a chord has an altered th then that becomes significant  more so than the rd. So Cdim refers to the diminished th CGb and Caug refers to the augmented th CG.  The former has a minor rd and the latter a major rd but in chord namesymbol terms they dont need mentioning.When ths are added to dim or aug chords it does get a little more complicated!  Firstly a dim triad like major and minor triads can have two kinds of th added  but in this case its either a minor th or a diminished th one semitone smaller than minor.  Adding the latter to a dim triad creates the dim chord which you could say is named after that unusual th interval.  Its also known as a fully diminished chord because it has two diminished intervals th and th in contrast with the other kind which only has one diminished interval th and is therefore known as halfdiminished.Cmb  C Eb Gb Bb  C halfdiminished m dim m Notice that the symbol pretends that weve taken a Cm chord and lowered the th rather than a dim triad and added a th.  Comes to the same thing. Cdim  C Eb Gb Bbb  C full diminished m dim dimBbb sounds like A of course but if we call it A then we should strictly speaking name the chord differently   A C Eb Gb  Adim.  AGb is now the requisite diminished th interval.Adim occurs as the vii chord in Bb harmonic minor.,musictheory,d70105b,3,t5_2qrjj

For instance American boy is in e major. First chord is emAjor which is the I chord then cmajor which is bVImajor which is borrowed from e aeolian. Next is a minor IVminor borrowed once again from e aeolian. Lastly f major borrowed from e Phrygian. Next I would look at blues harmony which you can kind of view it as its own thing.

These are two somewhat conflicting approaches to the connection of acoustical physics and the concept of tonality. The Pentatonic is also all the tones of the major scale minus the tritone. It is the easiest to sing and to hear and it the basis of most folk song in most cultures. It is widely used because it represents the strongest tones that we hear in every tone that we hear. It is modulated every time that a major scale minor also but that is a bit more complicated to explain modulates and often more than that. Because it is contained in both the major and natural minor scales it is included in any new key that is the target of modulation in the functional harmonic system of music that we use in the CPP and the western european musical culture.

9206822,0,t3_53xode,Have been watching this thread for a sciencebased answer so here goesThere are  parts to this.The air is a  mixing console. Everything reaches our ear as one waveform.  When two notes are played together for instance C and E what actually reaches your ear is not  independent waves but one single combined waveform with a distinct pattern of beating.  This beating is actually what tells our ear which two notes were hearing.Beating is a concept having to do with how cycles of waveforms line periodically align with each other creating new frequncies.  The beating of tones is in a sense the fingerprint of the chord which our ears and brains then somewhat miraculously parse back out and we recognise it as a chord. This beating of any  notes produces its own frequency which will always be a subharmonic relationship of those two notes.  Meaning any  notes will beat at a frequency below the fundamental of that chord.  The closer the pitches the lower the subharmonic.  C beats more slowly against C than D than D etc. These subharmonics are easily audible running a piano or guitar patch through an extremely heavy distortion processor.  Play C with D then C with E then C with F  through a fuzz box and you can easily hear this new tone beneath the fundamental of whatever note youre playing.The second part of the answer is down to the fact that our senses have measurable limits.Lower and equally higher pitches become increasingly more difficult to recognize because our ears are only accurate within the range from around  Hz to .kHz or so.  This is evolutionary.  Our ears are tuned to the range useful for recognising human speech.  Just as our eyesight breaks down at the extreme edges of the red and blue so do our ears outside these frequencies.High frequencies above around  kHz begin to sound all the same to us they all sound like buzzing or ringing.  Most people cant identify individual notes played that high where chords sound like insects swarming.  Our perception gives out entirely around kHz. And on the other side of the frequency spectrum when we get down below  Hz our perception deteriorates as well.  The beating tones of a chord are subharmonic so they are lower than the fundamental. By the time were at  Hz again everything begins to sound the same but down in this range we just hear it all as rumble.  And below  Hz its more of a sensation in the chest than it is a sound.Regards,musictheory,d8j17rz,2,t5_2qrjj

Artificial modulations are part of the arrangement not the composition.That said I enjoy built in modulations San Antonio Rose has a bridge in the key of the dominant. San Antonio Rose is also interesting because of a different modulation. Bob Wills would fiddle the tune in the key of D then modulate to whatever key his current singer would sing it in.

And since you have no fucking clue what the hell Im talking about we both know that you are not churning out the greatest music right?So maybe shutup and listen because there might be people on teh internet that are more talented than you and that you could learn from. Instead of going around with this confidence through ignorance. If beethoven was going around using rules to help him compose then he would have to have had a mind less capable than mine. I cant accept that since I know the quality of music he made.

9571522,0,t1_d9smvyz,Thanks for the very detailed response! On a few points that you madegtPeople with AP would identify the key of a song without having heard it before.The idea of the experiment isnt to listen to any song its to go in cold and ask the participants to sing back a song without any reference. Thats why I think people with absolute pitch may just perform similarly to people without it and people with no musical training at all.Thank you for the stories about pitch memory. As a percussionist I basically have the A of my tuning fork memorized to reference when I tune timpani. Yet when tuning to pitches like oh I dunno Ab C Eb Ab I would try to go from the A to the C first then down a major rd and so on. When Im done I would check to a piano and the notes would still be off. Im always surprised by my ability to remember the A and perform well in music theory relative pitch activities yet still not be great at tuning timpani. Maybe it also has to do with timbre. Despite being a percussionist I can nail intervals on piano way better than timpani. Luckily Im friends with the tuba player in front of me who has absolute pitch.Now Im not trying to go into the pathological aspects of this though it seems inevitable but I did come across a few journals which studied what you were talking about with pitches in voice. Very cool stuff.Did you have any further reading on what you mention here?gtThe point here is that once we pass infancy that sensitivity to sound diminishes. The language instinct has done its job. As older children more so as adults we find it much harder to learn a foreign language by ear alone. Same with music. The older we get the harder it is to revive that pitch sensitivity we were all born with but which fell by the wayside if it wasnt switched on in infancy.Thanks again!,musictheory,d9svvpa,1,t5_2qrjj

10009975,0,t3_5j0evu,Its the same as in a major key. I think you are referring to the three forms of the minor but you are asking as if there is only one form of the minor.  Each form of the minor has its own diatonic context. If you are in the natural or pure minor any accidental is not diatonic. In the other forms any note that is not in that forms context is not diatonic. How do you keep them separate? Well each form has its own rules or conventions and that is the standard. You have to understand them to fully understand which form of the minor is being used. Then it is perfectly clear. Just as a side note I would ask why is this important?

But it does depend on A sounding like the key centre  thats not down to it being the first chord although that helps but more likely being the last chord the one that feels like a final chord. Thats because these  chords could belong to several keys although at least one of them would be a borrowed or secondary chord.

10276839,0,t1_dc8vp3g,I believe weve got ahead of ourselves a little bit. We have so many instruments with truly incredible players and now a decline of people writing for them. You can do anything with the instrument that is an orchestra. The instrumentalists are outofthisworld incredible. Just last week we were recording a cue and I was talking to the bassoonist about a certain part and they suggested playing a multiphonic  they showed me and could play a note chord. On bassoon?! Not just that the whole section could do it and control it. When you have players like that we dont need more instruments! People dont realise whats out there  hence my rant on orchestration books you might have seen around here.Saying all that  I consistently use bass guitar with my orchestrations for big loud stuff. Its a tight and controllable addition to the low end. Other than that extreme low instruments are creeping their way into normal scoring sessions now. Nearly all action stuff we replace French horns with Wagner tubas and for tubas we use cimbassi instead. Just finished working today with Contrabass Clarinet too. Theyre quite common in big scores now. One change Id love to see made is the contrabassoon being replaced by the Contraforte. I think theres only a few in existence and was used in a recording of The Alpine Symphony. Its near enough the same but far more versatile and can get down to A. It smooths out a lot of technical difficulty for players too  great instrument. ,musictheory,dc8xoia,8,t5_2qrjj
10303397,0,t3_5ni5nv,The IV or subdominant function is one of the three most powerful functional areas of our music in general. If you start on the TONIC in order for our brains to process the music the music in our culture has to move away from this tonic for interest and then return to tonic through some manner back to tonic. The most used scheme of returning is the Cycle of Fifths path back to tonic. The CoF however has many different ways to interact with our music. The IV chord major or minor is a Fifth below the Tonic so it is one of the most natural tones for the Tonic Root to progress to as it lies a th below the Tonic. You see this in the Blues ALL the time. Its part of the blues formula to start on I move to IV and then back to I. Once you choose to go to the IV you have a couple of choices to make. You can return directly back to Tonic or you can then move on. If you return you are back to the tonal start and you are ready to go again. BUTIf you want to go on tonally you can look at that IV in two at least two ways to come back to Tonic. You can spend some time on the IF or you can actually create some progression as if you modulatted to the IV and then return back to TONIC OR you can take that IV and continue to the Dominant chord or key area you might call that a temporary modlation and then come back to Tonic for the next section. OR you can take the IV as the beginning of the CoF back to tonic. IV VII III VI II V I As well as several variations of the above. Jut as chords can function as Tonic SubDominant and Dominant Key areas or modulations can work the exact same way as far as Functional Harmony is concerned. So when looking to keep movement in the composition the composer will often use not only single chords to establish function but will use sections of the music to establish a larger sense of function by having a chorus in Tonic the next in Subdominant maybe back to Toniic and then back t Dominant and then back to Tonic.  If you look at that last sentence you will notice that if you look at the Blues and a lot of the s RampB progressions examples of this in the chordal sense but you will also notice that the riffs on each of the I IV and V sections are extended and have progressions within the frame work of something like the  bar Blues or the Tonic Dominant RampB  bar blues form. Short summary Its functional harmony influences that make the IV chord the easiest and in many ways the closest place that the progression can go to in order to preserve the tonality of the music as well as to provide a direction for the harmony to move the song along.

10386977,0,t3_5oho8a,gt  IId  I is used in the opening and closing cadences. Does this work because IId shares three common tones with IV thus forming a type of plagal cadence? I notice it also serves to prolong the tonic pedal note of G. Is IIdI a common progression in tonal music?No these arent cadences the piece has fourbar phrases not twobar phrases.A iid  i progression is not common more usual is iid  Vb  i. In fact I would say that what we have here isnt really iid  i at all as ublamsberg said the G functions more like a pedal tone and has a chord above it that contains  out of  notes of viio which is equivalent to Vb.gt  In bars  and  there is the progression ic  V  I. As per my understanding the tonic chord in second inversion has dominant function or is it predominant? and is followed after V by the root position tonic. In this example the ic is minor as per the home key but the root tonic chord is major. Is this a common form of modulation to the opposite mode in tonal music?A cadential Ic chord is better though of as a V chord with  and  suspensions happening at the same time. Youll often see this written as V. This notation makes it clear that the chord has a dominant function not a tonic one.As for the opposite mode thing it is common moving from minor to major look up picardy third but not the other way round. We dont call it modulation however. Modulation implies a change of key center e.g. changing from the key of G to the key of D but all we have here is a change of mode.gt  Bars  stumped me. At the end of bar  we get what I believe to be the German Sixth chord which resolves to ic as expected but we dont then get chord V instead we get chord IV then a return to ic then finally a V but this then moves back to ic before a Vd then a perfect cadence in c major. Is my chord analysis correct here? If so it doesnt seem to conform to the Ger  ic  V that I would expect. What is going on here and is it another frequently used technique?Youre correct that the expected progression here would be Ger  ic V  i. It certainly sounds like thats what about to happen in m.  The ic sounds like a cadential  which we expect will resolve to V and then move on to i. But what actually happens is that this  chord turns out not to be a cadential  but a passing  between the Ger and the iv instead. Mendelssohn is playing on our expectations and the fact that the sonorites sound the same.gt  The Vd in bar  moves to V in c major. It appears to modulate via chromatic movement    gt CB natural FF natural and everything else moving by a tone or staying the same. Again is this a common technique for modulation?There is chromatic movement here but fundamentally this progression is based on the diatonic circle of fifths. Imagine the D was followed immediately by G this would just be a normal Vd  I progression in the tonicized key of G. Then imagine an F was added to that G it would turn it into V of C. What actually happens is that those two steps happen at the same time Instead of the D chords F moving up to G and then down to F it just moves straight from F to F. If you were in C major you would notate this as     VdV  V  IVdV is pronounced Five Seven Dee of Five. This sort of technique is very common.,musictheory,dclfful,2,t5_2qrjj

However they by no means are standard and I dont think there is currently a standardized way of appropriately using these kinds of meters.Plus as it currently stands there isnt much of a reason to use these types of meters unless you plan to use essentially an unfinished tuplet as part of your piece. I mean if a bar of  is the same as a bar of  in triplet time then you could just have it in  with triplets notated or in  with the appropriate tempo marking to make it easy to read. However lets say you wanted  eighth note triplets i.e. th notes instead of  in one measure then it would be appropriate to use  as  does not fit into any standard time signature length though it could be argued to use a tempo change instead and have the meter be in But anyways in short there are meters with odd denominators but due to standardized practice of music and rhythms most of what we have are meters with denominators of a power of . Furthermore in many cases it is easier just to use a standard time signature rather than one with an odddenominator due to how uncommon it is to use for instance incomplete triplets relative to the quarter note.,musictheory,de9t3kr,1,t5_2qrjj

11036989,0,t3_5xiwr0,The answer by unrjk is really good but Im not sure if it might click with you. Ill try to give an answer more focused to guitar.  Note it makes a lot more sense if you learn to read music notation or at least if you learn the corresponding note letter to each fret on standard tuning. Relevant video hereAn interval is the music theory name for the distance in semitones between two notes. A  semitone distance equals the distance between a fret and the next one so for example the distance between the nd and th fret on any string equals  semitones. A semitone is also called a half tone  semitones are also called a whole tone.Intervals can be used in two ways a as generic intervals e.g. that note is a third above or b as specific intervals e.g. G is a perfect th above C.As you can notice from looking at your guitar there are lots of interval distances you can come up with the relationship between any two notes.Each interval has a particular name they are the followingdistance semitones | name | symbol|| | perfect unison unison | P | minor second | b | major second |  | minor third | b | major third |  | perfect fourth | P  | augmented fourth diminished fifth tritone |  b T | perfect fifth | P  | minor sixth | b | major sixth |  | minor seventh | b | major seventh |  | perfect octave | P They keep going as shown here but usually something far beyond the th interval isnt used. Remember you can change semitones for frets to figure it out.One of the most useful things intervals can do for you is giving names to sounds. For example play the notes C and E together B string st fret e string open those same notes can be found elsewhere but that isnt important right now. Listen to that sound. Thats the sound of a major rd. Ok now play the D and F notes together B string rd fret e string nd fret. Listen to that sound. Thats a major rd again. How come two different pairs of notes can have the very same relative sound? Thats because we kept the distance between the notes a  semitones distance a major rd apart. Heres a great video showing the sound of the main intervalsSo how can intervals help you with scales? Lets try the pentatonic minor scale guitarists favourite scale. First of all the pentatonic scale is made up of five different notes if you only learn them as shapes it might seem very arbitrary why youre using these notes and not other ones that usually leads to confusion and frustrated guitar wanking.Relative to the root the intervals that make the pentatonic minor scale are R root b   b in other words the root the minor rd the perfect th the perfect th and the minor th. Having the b is what makes it minor. Now we can calculate the semitone distance therefore the fret distance. Keep in mind the tuning relationship between strings for example the note A can be found on the E string th fret and on the A string open.Instead of thinking the x scale has these shapes you can begin looking the fretboard as intervals you stop being a space monkey that has to be told what to do and you become a selfsufficient player that can actually think what to do.Just like scales are made with intervals chords are made with intervals. Any chord has a particular interval formula for example any major chord is R   root major rd perfect th any minor seventh chord is R b  b root minor rd perfect th minor th. So yes you can use intervals to make triads and even more on the fly.If you have more questions let me know Ill be glad to help.,musictheory,dej0uja,2,t5_2qrjj

One observation about the Am is it seems to follow on from the Ab quite logically.

But if the piece of music is not specifically designed for this theres no fundamental difference between an easy song and a hard song.

11338979,0,t3_61sq06,Whats the point of memorizing scales in the first place?  You need to answer this question before you can figure out what you need to memorize.If your goal is to get the notes under your fingers for your instrument once you can do all the major scales quickly youll pretty much be all set without having to worry about the minor scales.  If your goal is to be able to simply know the scale then you should work on both major and minor but really all you need is to play something like the WellTempered Clavier which has a prelude and fugue in each major and minor key to get a good feel for it.  I do transcriptions of sung music and that comes in pretty much all keys so I have a good grasp on how to think in each key.You almost never have to explicitly worry about modes and such other than major and minor since theyre simple alterations.  For example if youre in C dorian well you know C minor is C D E F G A B so you just raise the th A becomes A and you have C dorian.What is useful is knowing intervals from the tonic.  So for example youre in Ab phrygian so you know you have a b making Bbb because thats the b of Ab.  You go to dorian so you need the  you know thats F.  But its actually dorian  so you play the  Eb the  D and the b Cb.  So if I ask you for example whats the  of D you should know its G.  If I ask you whats the b of F you should know that its Cb.

11469070,0,t3_63ox8d,Im also a self taught musician all the way until I got into Music school. I would say start from the basics. Learn your scales in  octaves in one position starting on the low E string then on the A in  octaves. From there you can figure out your  arpeggios. In the case of C its CEGB. Then you can learn them starting off the third then off the fifth and the seventh. A lot of my technique with the  hands was from learning songs that were fast and creating exercises that implemented a metronome. A huge thing would be to set goals for yourself like I want to play faster or I want to be able to play this song at that speed. So on and so forth. With chords its important to learn a little about the theory aspect of it because from there you can make build your own voicings. What I mean is you figure out the relationship between your fingers and what the distance of the frets is in relationship to your root note is. For example taking your middle finger and placing on the third fret of the A string which is a C and your pointer finger on the nd fret of the D string which is an E. the relationship is a major third and then taking the chord you know and figuring out those relationships. This will help you be able to know what youre playing and possibly changing it that chord. Now I personally dont know your ability and it would be a lot easier for me to answer your question if you explained your goals a little more in depth. Let me know ,musictheory,dfw0hjr,1,t5_2qrjj
11479105,0,t3_63tn5j,gt Can you actually write say a Dorian chord progression?Absolutely. A common Dorian progression features a minor tonic and a major IV. A progression like Am  C  G  D for example is in Dorian. In the context of this chord progression not including an F while improvising a solo might feel awkward. Some real world examples of Dorian progressions   Gary Jules  Mad World Justin Timberlake  What Goes Around Tigran Hamasyan  Love Song Beatles  Rocky RaccoonIn the case of the Beatles tune the G constitutes a departure from Dorian but you can just as easily analyze that chord as V of C to reconcile the Ds role. Regardless all these examples feature some kind of i  IV motion. gt And therefore every chord change is a mode change as well? For example C Am F G. Is this progression Ionian? Or is it Ionian to aeolian to Lydian to mixolydian?Not exactly. Playing C ionian then A aeolian isnt going to create an overwhelming departure from C as your tonal centre. Having said that a skilled player can craftily superimpose scales over each of those chords to emphasize some kind of tensions which is then resolved.If you really want to start hearing beyond Ionian and Aeolian look at a major blues form. The blues is the most accessible form since linguistically you can experiment with only the Mixolydian mode. ...and an important skill to develop generally is being able to shift a single mode between different keys so playing A Mixo  D Mixo. Im definitely not saying this is how to play the blues. Youll want to look at the hybrid scale to do that convincingly. But Mixo has less notes and so while youre learning to shift between keys this is a more accessible place to begin.

11526319,0,t3_64gcuw,The short answer is FORM! Select a symphonic form you want to write and if it would be a Sonata Allegro form for example you know you need two contrasting themes. You will need an intro you will need a coda. Start with what ever ideas you have most solidified most likely the themes. The form will tell you some of the conventions of key relationship of the themes and how you repeat them in the Recapitulation. Your themes will also be the bulk of the Development section so this is an important part and most likely should be where you start. The INtro may also be related to the themes so that is another reason to start there. But the Sonata Allegro is not the simplest but it is the most used in the CPP for symphonies.  There iis also rondo. And there are Themes and variations. SO if a symphonic form like the sonata allegro is too much to bite off for your first symphonic attempt you might start with a simpler form but using the symphonic orchestra to get familiar with orchestration and how to use the instruments. I will warn you It is a lot of work to start writing a symphony. and that is where there is some ambiguity in your question. If you can write for a Jazz Band the question is do you want to write a Symphony or do you want to write for something using a symphony orchestra! IF you want to write a symphony why not write a symphony using the symphonic form and orchestrate it with the Jazz band instead of a symphonic orchestra. If you do this you will not have to learn the form AND the orchestration all at once. There is no rule that you have to use the full orchestra and you can always expand on your work and orchestrate it with more complicated formulas and the full symphonic  orchestra. Your life will be a lot easier or should I say you might still have a life as if you start with the big forms with the big orchestras that will be a very large project and you will not get it done and have a life while doing it! lol. BUt it could be fun if you use a medium that you already know. You can even use jazz tunes and that will make it simpler. IF you want to go into this more I will help if I can.

NB metrical accent is different from dynamic accent. chords in the first and third positions are most likely to be perceived as tonic for this reason.Repeating  in higher voices is not as common as repeating  in pop songs. Classical is a different story of course.I could bring in a bunch of other things the relative relationship between Fampm verses and A major choruses being  times more common in pop songs than the mediant relationship between Famp verses and D choruses the notes of the melody in A major itd be  in the lowerenergy part and amp in the higher energy part in D major itd be  and  never actually articulating  at all the fact that Camp never ever once goes up to D!I am totally willing to acknowledge ambiguity where it exists but I cant even imagine hearing this chorus in D.
