5966555,0,t3_3uoyo9,I would buy a space suit then get up to date on my physics space and chemistry knowledge fast. Then I would bring back priceless souvenirs from space for people on earth. I wouldnt bother with the past and I wouldnt bother with earth. As long as I only let people know that I can move to other planets the governmentsterrorists dont have any reason to kill me.  Id choose portal over teleportation. Eventually I would give Elon Musk a big discount on his satellites by pushing them straight into orbit through a portal. As long as he doesnt tell anyone and gives me a nice chunk of change he would be able to save nearly all the fuel his rather ambitious plans call for. Using this capital I would be able to start up my own space mining company and be the sole shareholder.  As soon as I start raking in the wealth I would invest incredibly in tech to prevent assassinations. Using my talent to get rich would bring attention to me and make governmentsterrorists try to kill me. To prevent this I would equip a dozen drones with heat vision and strong cryptography so that they can relay everything that happens on the ground near me to me without any chance of interception by an enemy. I would give a trillion dollars to charity so that people who care about public opinion would be unable to detestkill me openly.  I would probably waste lots of money searching for other people with similar talents have my genetics looked at the find the source of the power and other such things. Of course none of these efforts would come to fruition because the hypothetical leaves no traces just one odd thing that never happened before and will never happen again.  Speaking of which I basically need to be the most paranoid person around. I will need to exercise three hours a day eat the healthiest food and never go out in public. All these things will keep me healthy and not assassinated. Since I am the only one who has these powers I ought to be extremely careful with my life. Humans may never again have the capacity to travel faster than lightthrough time once I die. I dont want my carelessness to cost humanity its one shot at the sort of cool shit my abilities could bring if I lived long enough.  I eventually do use my powers to cause some political changes and other stuff but I go real easy on the time travel. You never know how screwed you can get with that stuff.  After I become the most powerful and wealthy human on earth there is only one thing out of my power can I become immortal if  I spend all my money on immortality research and maybe jump forwards a few centuries to pick up the results?  If yes I become immortal and humanity spreads out over the stars in a burst of glory that will last until the stars turn dark and universe ends. Then I repeat it all over again bringing some knowledge from the far future with me to the past.  If no I at least give humans a good shot by dispersing colonies of humans and robots across the universe so they can propagate and serve my vision of a greater good for as long as they last. Since I cant survive forever I build myself a tomb on a distant uninhabited planet and when my time runs out I throw myself into my sarcophagus through a portal. As I greet oblivion I reminisce on my works and hope that humanity will do well in the future.,whatwouldyoudoif,cy1qw75,1,t5_2v65e
