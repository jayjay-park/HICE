11563133,0,t3_651j0s,Murray can literally doctor shop until he gets one to say he has no mole on his sack.  HIPAA regulations would prevent his doctors from releasing any observations without Murray signing off on it.  The fact that his personal doctor is the one putting out this information should be noted.Lets just say it would a gay man who is supportive of the gay Mayor put out false information to protect him?  Especially when hes not at risk of perjury by putting it out in the news media?Its highly probable.Time to find an independent physician who is not a Murray supporter to perform the inspection.,The_Seattle,dg6opkq,1,t5_3i2v2
