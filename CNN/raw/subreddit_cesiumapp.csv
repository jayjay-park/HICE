4825049,0,t3_3gkog3,I just read all of these comments and it seems like it would be useful to have a setting so choose how the queueing behavior works. I also tend to use queueing as creating little playlists for example pick a song I almost invariably use Artists to choose the song I want then pick a different one from a different artist and add it to the queue and continue. Up next works fine for me doing this I just get confused initially when the most recent song that I picked plays but Im sure Id get used to that. The problem for me is the same as described by uAgely when I have friends picking songs in the car they expect it to play in the order that they picked them not reverse order.It may be a lot tougher than I think though to have such a core element of the app as a setting but thats just an idea. I love settings options ,cesiumapp,cu2qj2j,1,t5_39b0a

11099718,0,t3_5xuufa,The Apple APIs dont actually allow you to modify playback queues you have to replace the whole thing every time. So when you clear the queue really what you are doing is setting a new queue that contains only the currently playing track. Then when you add a new track your setting the queue again to current track. Its really a semiofficial loophole that allows this to be done seamlessly its undocumented but Ive had enough conversation with members of Apples team to know they are taking advantage of it to so it must be by design.Now my insufficientlytested theory is that the system does a little prep work for the upcoming song in the final seconds of the currently playing track. Modifying the queue during this window and Im not sure how long it is might be the issue here.I just tried this action in the first  seconds or so of a  min track. No issues. If you notice a pattern or a trigger please let me know!,cesiumapp,deq56ah,2,t5_39b0a
