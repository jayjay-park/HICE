11731937,0,t1_dgpubca,Yeah ok. The rhetoric is literally exactly the same and the polling wasnt nearly as different as youre suggesting. They werent within the margin of error until within a few days of the election because thats when the pollsters realized that their bogus polls werent having the effect they wanted and they had to backtrack to keep from looking completely foolish. She was literally  points ahead a few weeks outside of the election and Trump had less than  chance from the beginning of the primaries until within a couple weeks.I obviously cant say that means shes definitely going to win but Im far from convinced is all.,Le_Pawn,dgpug1b,102,t5_3k5fp
