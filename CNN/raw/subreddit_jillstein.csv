I am not sure she would do that just look at how unpopular downvoted this idea is here on this subreddit in this post  but maybe I am wrong. I really think reforming Islam is the only way to go if we want a peaceful coexistance between all religious and areligious groupsTry to say that to a Muslim so going to Muslim families and taking pictures is not an option. Bringing a guy like Maajid Nawaz I am sure there are similar guys in America into her campaign is the way to go.

8418561,0,t3_4uxlyj, Its not necessarily an existential statement or vote of conscience. This year has yielded an extraordinarily rare opportunity  it seems very feasible we can get  allowing the Greens to be a New Party  Minor Party under FEC rules and so qualify for funding.  The common antithirdparty argument for incrementalism is not actually particularly historically specific and does not reflect the perceived dangers of Trump or anything else unique about our time. Its sort of a variant of arguments about revolution vs reform that have been had in social movements for decades at least.  The problems we face are transformative and exponential climate and global economic instability foremost  they do not operate on an incremental timeline and the challenges they pose cannot be met by incrementalist strategies. We need transformative change because of the nature and urgency of these catastrophes.  For those who tell the Greens to start at the grassroots and build a base then come back later with a presidential ticket  the Greens are required to run a presidential candidate in order to qualify for lower races  the Greens run hundreds of candidates at many levles in any particular  year period its the media that ignores them. For those who ask where was Jill for the Past  years point them to the Green Shadow Cabinet which operated during that time modeling what a Stein administration would have looked like.  We are demanding some form of tiered balloting that enables stndrd choice voting. We are also demanding the debates be more inclusive and hopefully no longer run by a private corporation.  Nader is not responsible for the Bush administration. Bush is responsible for it. Gore is responsible for a weak triangulation strategy and terribly neocon VP pick.

8649196,0,t1_d6mcay0,First of all yes his question was literally How could you sleep at night?Now onto the main point. His entire premise is inherently flawed and for more than one reason First the Nader comparison has never been accurate or relevant. Nader did not cost Gore the election. Nader wasnt even a factor. The amount Nader supposedly pulled from Gore would not have made any difference other than maybe Florida which was the deciding state however unofficial recounts after SCOTUS suspended democracy and appointed Bush have shown that Gore won Florida. So Nader wasnt a factor because Gore won. Nader is a convenient rhetorical tool but has no basis in reality whatsoever.Second saying Jill pulls from Hillary to help Trump is absolute nonsense. It assumes that peoples votes belong to Hillary by default which is laughable. Trump can blame Jill for helping Hillary win if she does and it isnt any less accurate. Candidates like Jill dont pull support away from another candidate Hillary does not own my vote. My vote is not going to Jill just because its Jill. There is no scenario in which my vote would go to Hillary because she is an absolutely unacceptable candidate. This is Clintons fault not Steins and the sense of entitlement prerequisite to even suggesting that voting for Jill pulls from Clinton is nauseating.

And those controversies had been floating around the media ever since he was picked as VP so its not like that CNN wouldve taught that  anything that they didnt already know.

And he has a remarkable ability to make idioticoffensive comments in tandem with Hillarys latest scandals taking the heat off the dark Queen.   I was listening to a radio interview with Julian Assange the other day and even he seemed open to the idea that Trump is tanking on purpose.   Basically all Donald had to do was tone down the crazy and pivot left.  Instead hes done the exact opposite.   Trump is difficult to get a handle on.   On the one hand his crassness seems to be resonating with much of the American public especially those who are sick to death of PC and the hyperpolicing of language.   On the other hand his criticisms of crooked Hillary are dumbed down to the point of rank idiocy.   Instead of saying the system was rigged against Bernie! he could have pointed to the massive exit poll discrepancies and the disenfranchisement of voters instead of saying Hillary and Obama founded ISIS! he could have pointed to articles in the NY Times showing State Department fundingtraining for radical Islamists in Libya and Syria.

Without securing the vote  knowing our votes will be counted correctly  we are left without the ability to vote in progressive candidates. Brand New Congress and Our Revolution will fail.

9622273,0,t3_5cm93p,First Jill Stein is up against a bought and paid for Duopoly establishment  that controls every thing. You have  choices that are run by Corporations . Its not a Government that is run by people like labourers  low income and middle class people  the majority of Americans.Its run by the Corporate personhood is the legal notion that a corporation separately from its associated human beings like owners managers or employees has some but not all of the legal rights and responsibilities enjoyed by natural persons physical humans.Everything that is run and controlled by the Corporate Personhood  Goverment  Military  Security  Elections Media  Education  Health  Food  Environment Etc and it was set up to do just that over  years ago from people like John Rockefeller. Until every American realizes this its not going to change .With people that have grown up under this controlled mind frame and that dont question  authority family and peers are perpetuating the statusquo your up against this establishment your up against people that are afraid of change and will attack you .That being said  the smallest mention of personal ideas  like wifi  vaccines  etc thats wasnt apart of the  Jill Stein  Platform  that is what you will be attacked for . Stick to the Platform dont go off topic with personal ideas be clear and have facts to back up your Platform .Second  Jill used fear tactics about  sea level rising over  feet and the end of all ports and coast nuclear reactors going Fukushima. Dont use FEAR tactics to that extent . Talking about transitioning to an alternative energy source would have been sufficient and should have got more publicity.For instance this point from me is too much for average people people to accept because it scares to many people  as its to big to fathom  the jobs loss the health aspects and the costs to change  is enough to strike too much fear into the hearts of people and send them off into smear and fear attacks .  Nuclear energy waste is the longest lasting most toxic waste we create. The problem with it is by the time you know its effecting you its to late . We have other alternative energy but like Jill Stein being suppressed  alternative energy has been suppressed for over  years to keep fossil fuels and nuclear energy suppliers in business . The longer we continue to not change the harder it will be to change . If we go too long without changing our energy system the less time we will have to change . We are in a Global War over energy right now its a matter of time before it becomes a Nuclear War. We have to avoid that outcome and change to an alternative energy system ASAP . Not to mention Nuclear and Fossil fuel is unsustainable  in OUR lifetime not our kids lifetime we dont have  more years of Nuclear and Fossil Fuel energy we barley have  years left to alter our dependency on our current energy system  we need to change NOW not  years or  or  years from now . We have passed our peak production of fossil fuel energy and cant continue to use Nuclear energy for much longer  because its so toxic . On a business level for long term investments Fossil Fuels and Nuclear energy is a very bad investment  but ATM for the short term its a very good investment with a Trump Presidency. Unfortunately it will have much higher costs in the long term of which you the tax payers will have to pay for.That being said so many people are suffering from toxic waste from our energy system its becoming an ever increasing health problems that adds to the cost of our energy system . Health Problems from our toxic waste  and the causes and effects that come from our toxic waste needs to be addressed  and it barely get enough coverage .Keep to the Platform . When people want to know about the platform keep it short and sweet and factual and be prepared to back your platform up with facts  to back up your case that your platform will work .The Green Party Platform is terrifying   because people are afraid of losing their jobs and entire way of life that effects Millions of potential voters . Tone it down .On an other note letting government take over things isnt the Government taking over YOU THE PEOPLE  It is YOU THE PEOPLE that Pay TAXES to the Government to do things for YOU THE PEOPLE . You pay taxes to get things from your Government. Its YOU THE PEOPLE that should DEMAND  where your taxes are being spent !!! Like Important things like INFRASTRUCTURE Health Care Education etc not WAR !!! DEMAND how and where your taxes are being spent !!! ITS YOUR MONEY DAM IT !!! DEMAND that your Taxes are being spent on things YOU THE PEOPLE NEED not what Corporate personhood decides where your taxes should be spent ..... Bernie Sanders understood this . All that being said  People wont change unless they are forced to do so  Forced through a Global War or Global Environmental Catastrophes . In the mean time be gentle and factual  with the population you are trying to get the votes from  dont fear the voters into voting .On a personal note  I have nothing to lose if we go into Global ThermoNuclear War or the entire Planet has a Global Environmental Catastrophe . Im old and am just a witness  to Humanities acts . All I can do is offer an opinion  and insight from my understanding of how I see things . Its truly up to you the people to forge a new way forward or not and wait for your actions to dictate the outcome of your decisions.Good Luck to you all  Ill live until I cant  the power is in our hands  together we can have a future we need for People Planet Peace over Profit .            ,jillstein,d9z566d,2,t5_2ty1q

Dont get me wrong I have respect for veterans. It takes courage and whether they did it for noble reasons or for self advancement they still did something most of us wont dont have the courage to do but theyre not some poster children for your cause. That being said what I think the veterans who are volunteering as water protectors are trying to accomplish here is to disillusion Americans. Maybe when people see the veterans that they prop up for their own purposes standing up on their own for a cause they believe in it may offer some more credibility on the issues of protecting our water and standing up against police brutality.,jillstein,db3j8r3,5,t5_2ty1q

The land has been stolen time and time again because theft and violence are values that cross races and cultures.On this particular issue if you choose to learn the complexities of the legal process Z is engaged in relative to Hawaiian history this PDF is very informative Its not as boring as it initially seems and it explains why this is such a clusterfuck of a situation in Hawaii.,jillstein,dcvpnbm,1,t5_2ty1q

10596318,0,t3_5rmi2p,gtOn Monday night after Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates over her refusal to defend Trumps Muslim ban many commentators compared the incident to the infamous Saturday Night Massacre in  when thenAttorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy resigned after President Richard Nixon ordered Richardson to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. I think its similar but different if only because she was being replaced in  days by his appointeegtCox was at Berkeley on May   when Secretary of Defense Elliott Richardson President Nixons nominee for attorney general called him to ask if he would consider taking the position of Special Prosecutor in the Watergate affair.This was NOT a four year position but ONLY to investigate Nixon.  So slightly different context IMO. ,jillstein,dd8xfww,3,t5_2ty1q

Its not that I think my entertainers should absolutely support my preferred candidate damnit!  Its just that they actively promoted her over all other Dem candidates made usually tame jokes about her primary opponents which served to lessen their value in the minds of their viewers actively ignored any and all concerns about Hillarys more controversial views fracking warmongering flipflopping nonsupport of singlepayer health concerns wall street ties cheating in the primary ad nauseam and occasionally fed into the Socialist meme with Sanders that I feel is particularly insidious and offensive.,jillstein,dftm96u,10,t5_2ty1q
