706030,0,t3_21x7lw,This is tough. It might not be of much help but you can see in the photo three lakes  two of them are bright in colour and the other one is darker normal. The two bright ones have a higher concentration of calcium carbonate in them and you can see what appear to be larger industrial buildings near them. That would likely be consistent with things like processing and crushing limestone from a nearby quarry or sometimes phosphate mining.To me the area looks a lot like Belgiumthe Netherlands. The UKs got more hills and the roads arent quite right. The roads are also at angles that are slightly odd for an American grid system and there are few places in Europe as flat as parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. Theres only one phosphate mine in the whole of Europe and its in Finland and looks nothing like that town. So my line of thought would be to look up limestone quarrying operations in the Benelux area and see what you turn up. Id do it myself now but Im exhausted and need to go to bed. Best of luck EDIT Heres a clearer photo of the town the last frame that its shown. There appears to be a railway line running next to the road which for mining purposes seems a tad bit American. However the density and style of buildings and layout of roads is still leading me to northwest Europe.,whereisthis,cgkj1xi,3,t5_2st7f

Ive looked online at their website and thought it was a place they visit but I did not manage to find a place or photo that exactly matches the locations topography. Ill get some close up images as soon as I can.Update Here are the images there is a full close up and another focused on the valley. I spot a road or well defined path that goes up the valley. It must be man made because it goes up the mountain side unlike a river.

8123225,0,t1_d4siqdc,I looked at it and imagined how it would look during summer and then I got a mental image of some old western movies where theyd cross bridges looking like this. So from there I was thinking midwestern or the northern part of the southern US. Then I searched for arch bridge southern US on google and I found a similar bridge somewhere in Kansas. From there I got another clue its actually called a rainbow arch bridge so I googled that. Far down the results page I found a small picture with a bridge looking like this and it linked to a flickr page that told me where it was.Edit I really enjoy your challenges.
