1096542,0,t1_chslgt3,Hi. I went with vonage in the end. Got two phones set up now. Original landline for incoming calls only new Vonage number for outgoing and incoming calls. Eventually I hope to phase out the original landline.I purchased the Vonage Premium  mobile package which made sense based on my call minutes usage.So far its cost me a fiver plus  quid for a Logik desk phone from Currys. Zero call cost so far. Line quality is good there is the tiniest split second delay on calls and i also have a divert set up so if i dont answer in the office it goes direct to my mobile.So far so good. The test will be if my overall phone bill drops in the next couple of months.,VOIP,chsxj8k,1,t5_2qrz4

1108308,0,t1_chu5k1l,Sure hence the bit about redundant internet connectivity and VSAT.Its pretty clear that you and I wont agree on survivable communications system design and thats fine. We pick up customers all the time because our competitors tell them its impossible to do what we do and we prove them wrong by setting up a demo and doing it. So youre kind of doing me a favor by insisting that theres no way to design a VOIP solution thats more reliable than the PSTN. Cheers and thanks!,VOIP,chu9tap,1,t5_2qrz4
1110867,0,t1_chu0z1e,First off  thanks for the reply. Without further detail I am going to make a few assumptions. You mention registration issues but state that the phone rings. To be clear registration is a process the phone goes through occasionally to check in with the provider and keep it uptodate with what your IP address is so calls can be sent to you as they come in to the providers servers. It typically does this by exchanging the usernamepassword along with a token from the provider to prove identity via the SIP protocol. If your phone were unable to complete this process it wouldnt be able to receive calls as the provider would not know what IP address to send the incoming call to. On the LinksysCisco phones you would notice the line LEDs changing from Green to Amber and the XLite would say Not ready if registration failed.Yep my explanation wasnt very thorough and I may not be explaining the issue entirely correctly. Im probably using registration issues as a bit of a catchall for a number of issues  and perhaps incorrectly. Yep youre right about the amber lights on the Linksys and Cisco phones. This does happen  the lights do randomly go from green to amber  but normally go back to green within  minute. Ive also had this happen during a call but the call remains unaffected. The other issues that I consider to be registration oriented are as mentioned the phone ringing but not being able to answer the call also calls going directly through to voicemail and not ringing at all. Ive not noticed not ready on xlite as yet. Another strange anomally which started to happen a few months back on my Cisco and continued when I switched to the Linksys and has also happened in the short time Ive used Xlite is that the incoming Caller ID facility frequently shows a peculiar number  I dont have a note of the number in front of me but its something like   again Ive assumed that that is somehow a registration issue its not correctly registering  showing the callers ID. If registration and call setup are possible but there is oneway or noway audio the router is typically suspect.Interesting. Yes when I receive a call and I pick the phone up but theres no one there I will normally call the person back or theyll call me back  and I asked them what happened on the previous call. Some have told me that they could hear me and others have said that they couldnt  and went to voicemail. I also have a fairly basic residential router  modem  an iinet Bob   which is essentially a Belkin I believe. Perhaps I should invest in a better router. I used to own a Billion. I will investigate disabling DOS Denial Of Service protection  thanks. Yes I have no issues making outbound calls via the VoIP service at all ever. I only have issues with incoming calls. Yes Im thinking that a soft phone solution may be generally more pleasant to work with. Im a little cautious just because Im used to a business desk phone solution as being bonafide but Xlite seems to work very well. I have had a couple of calls come in in which the speaker was way too loud even when I adjusted the volume  but that could be just a bit of tweaking required or just a problem with those people that I was speaking with. Using a soft phone might even justify buying superior wireless headphones  mine cost  or so I think there are others that cost  or so that might be significantly better ?. The multiple lines aspect of Bria is probably required for me. With Xlite a second line will come in but Im not sure if theres a functionality to switch between calls  so Ive been letting them go to voicemail for now. Also if the playback of recorded audio is garbled you may need to have your provider check into that. Yeah  with my Linksys when I try to access voicemail I dial  the recorded message press  to listen to new messages etc will be garbled  and if I manage to get through the message it may not be garbled at all. If I use xlite I can access voicemail with no issues at all. Accessing voicemail was one of the primary reasons I started using Xlite. I dont think the issue is a bandwidth issue  I have superfast ADSL with a very solid connection  and I dont use wireless headset with the Linksys and the Cisco is connected via cable when in use. So from here it seems that Bria and softphones in general get the thumbs up and that I should check the DoS status with my existing router and consider purchasing a superior router  any suggestions? Would a Billiion do the trick? I dont mind buying a new router because my wife is always complaining of not having a stable wireless connection in the lounge so we could do with some new technology to fix that.  Ive just had a couple of calls coming into Xlite that I wasnt able to answer  one appeared to go straight through to voicemail  the other had silence for  to  seconds and then kicked in and I could hear them they could hear me. Does this point to DoS again?  Ive started having Account failed to enable messages on xlite ,VOIP,chukb45,1,t5_2qrz4

2550998,0,t3_2owjsz,Ive been working the Telecom industry now for about  months. Ive noticed this too all though to be fair I think this applies to almost all sectors of business.  Telecom though one of the reasons for the territorial people is because of the money involved in Telecom.  Its not always cheap  so when you make a recommendation for a purchase and youre the person that runs that system its your baby  it has to be your baby because its expensive if it goes down.Additionally as someone else mentioned Telecom is drastically changing and will continue to drastically change as the years go on.  From what I can gather were starting to see steady drops in Telecom costs year over year  primarily due to VoIPSIP  and providers that relied on big expensive systems and carrier contracts are struggling to make the switch to a cloud world.   Yes there will always be circuits  but there will not be enough to go around and there wont be enough to sustain the old business.  Circuits even in the last couple of years PRIsTs have dropped drastically.  So businesses have the same number of customers with half the MRC than they used to get from them.  Luckily the company I work for has adapted to the Hosted world  and the customers we would have lost we are able to transition to VoIPSIP without losing them  but we typically do take a hit to our MRC because of it.And we run into problems all the time trying to deal with their IT people when implementing the new system a lot due to the fact that we dont need them.  You can get rid of your old PRI and T circuit replace it with a completely hosted platform and not have to deal with all of that anymore.

I personally wipe EVERYTHING on a source FS install and rebuild basic dialplan and profiles from scratch that make sense for your situation.  You likely need two sip profiles one that you will receive the call on that is configured to advertise the WAN IP of your office back upstream and a secondary that advertises your private IP to the far end over the vpn.  From there youd set up the default context of your external or whatever you want to call it profile to bridge to the remote office over your internal profile.  so it would gointernet gt fw gt fs external profile gtbridge out internal profile gt vpn  If the call from the wide internet is hitting your internal profile it means that your external profile is not setup the way it ought to be.

That said since you say it works pretty good and you want something fairly idiot proof maybe this will work.Your best bet by far is an Obihai ATA Analog Telephony Adapter.  Thats a little box that has Ethernet on one side and a normal RJ phone port on the other.  Plug a normal analog phone or cordless phone into the RJ port and itll get a dialtone.  Once you program in all the provider settings your user can just pick up that phone and make a call like it was any other normal dumb phone.  If you want cheap service maybe register a free Google Voice account.  Thatll get you free or cheap calling.  Otherwise check out flowroute.com for like mo you get a phone number calls in and out are around a penny per minute.  Obihai will work with either one.  ,VOIP,d2cv5se,3,t5_2qrz4

9354701,0,t3_58mn10,What you are wanting to do is pretty simple to do with an open source PBX like Asterisk. In the most basic sense you just need some kind of computer running a Linux distro. There are prebuilt distros like AsteriskNOW or FreePBX that have everything installed for you already and make it easy to get something running. You can even run it on a Raspberry Pi if you dont need much processing power which you wont for your basic announcements that you described.You can set up what you are wanting without actually learning VoIP per se. A lot of people who run Asterisk have no idea what the protocols look like on the back side and you could live your whole life without learning the intricacies of SIP if you had no need to dive that deep.Eventually you are going to want someone to be able to dial into your PBX and thats where youre going to have to make some decisions. If you only want to be able to receive calls from phonesdevices connected to the same network or the internet then it isnt difficult and you dont need to pay anyone other than the ISP where you run the server.If you want to get into the wider world of being able to accept calls from anyone with a phone not just extensions on your own system then youll have to buy a Direct Inward Dial DID number from one of the many VoIP providers out there. I have had good luck with Vitelity for small oneoff things like you are doing and the costs are pretty low. I have a single DID that I bought from them years ago so maybe the prices have gone up but I only pay about  a year plus charges for minutes of use that rarely go over  a month. Again your mileage may vary now that VoIP providers are more popular.Get a computer install FreePBX and then install a SIP softphone on another computer and you can be up and running with your project in a day or two.,VOIP,d91rx91,3,t5_2qrz4

Were going to test for a few months and pay attention to the differences between outboundinbound before we make any big changes.  It may also be advantageous to keep both.

9705809,0,t3_5e1zmq,Ive found that often business class cable simply has latency issues that they ISP isnt interested in fixing so changing providers or equipment wont make any difference. The unfortunate solution in several cases was a cheap T yes oldskool T that the phones were then connected to. That completely solved the issues a T has more than enough bandwidth for many many simultaneous calls and also normally has very low latency.I had some clients using Nextiva which has their main connection on Level . The clients got a Level  T and then the latency to Nextiva was nearly zero.,VOIP,da9g6cp,0,t5_2qrz4

10105640,0,t1_dboh615,Allworx or avaya ip office meeting most needs out of the box theres only an issue with the speech to text option. How many handsets are you looking for? Allworx would be under  per handset and the server is about    . Sip trunks would be about    per session simultaneous call per month.  sessions about  per month all in. You only need enough sessions to meet your maximum amount of people on the phone at one time. Avaya is the same   percent give or take. Hosted would have you buy the handset best bet is Yealink at about  per handset less if you shop around. Then its    per month per handset forever.

10481003,0,t3_5q3vus,st Id check on the stability of that SuddenLink connection.  Setup an external ping monitor I like monitis.com because you can do Pings and SIP monitoring but any ping monitor should work.  nd you mentioned throttling down you connection.  I suspect that this could be causing some issues.  Even a mismatch between full duplex and  duplex on the connection between their gateway and your router can caught all sorts of problems.  That Cisco RVW can negotiate at Gbps but if Suddenlink is really sending Gbps you might need to accommodate for possible overhead... something that can handle over Gbps.  Id work with Suddenlink regarding this often they have to change something on their end and then you have to change something on your router end.  Also I could be wrong but the throughput on that DLink DSR  might be lacking. Phones should be able to communicate even if all phones are on a call at the same time with under Mbps.  rd QoS if not setup absolutely correct can also be problematic.  Have you seen if turning QoS off resolves any issues?  Any VLANs setup?  th. SIP ALG or SIP Transformations some routersfirewalls do this well and other do it very badly.  Might try seeing if there is a difference with this on or off on your router.  th.  Do some traceroute monitoring from inside your network out to Fonality.  I use PingPlotter a lot for tasks like this.  You can sometimes discover that its their end or something inbetween you and them.  th.  Check the obvious things.

10651740,0,t1_ddekax2,Think about it. If an ISP is causing deprioritzation of competitors sip packets eventually unless you go to each site and setup tunnels back to the DC youre going to get compliaints. Phones are like are. You should only notice them if its not there and thats how most small businesses operate.  Say a small business is having problems with a BHN competitors voice service.  Shortly after a BHN rep walks in their door promising that since they own the network the customer would never have these problems. Ive seen this sales pitch in person. Next thing you know youve lost that customer.   Now while youre spending your money time and resources fighting a legal battle ISP is rolling your customers to their service.  By the time you win the legal battle your customers are gone. ,VOIP,dden8br,2,t5_2qrz4

11348586,0,t1_dfian2l,Think of SIP as the protocol that gets the phone traffic to you and from your office.  SIP is broadband and PRI is dial up. You are paying Comcast for three things essentially DIDs usually lt.mo per.  This is simply a phone number. You can have as many as you want Trunks think the number of simultaneous phones calls you can have. This is the bulk of your bill.  Routing and support think of SIP as the network based version of the older PRI you refer to.  A PRI could handle  simultaneous calls. SIP is somewhat unlimited. SIP is pointed to a public IP address your phone system so calls route directly to their destination with minimal latency. Support is key as if it breaks you need good help fast. AllWorx is a great product and honestly fairly easy to learn. Plenty of YouTube videos if you spend an hour will explain the basics you need to know. SIP is going from Comcast all the way to the AllWorx.  Sometimes there are boxes between such as the Ciena that focus on QoS.  These boxes can be provided by provider Comcast to make sure that VoIP gets the bandwidth dont want someone streaming YouTube to ruin a phone call. Hope that helps. ,VOIP,dficavn,3,t5_2qrz4
