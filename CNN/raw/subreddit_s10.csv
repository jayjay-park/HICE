5809387,0,t3_3ufxa1,I have the x version of that. Great truck with the r. The only quirk Ive noticed is that without a separate tranny cooler they tend to run hot. Mine stays around  with the cooler and  electric fans added to the radiator.. Get a shift kit if you plan on towing.,s10,cxh7jur,2,t5_2stg1

6745782,0,t1_d0gwoje,I forgot about that switch. Thats probably exactly what happened to me. Everyone says that when you have that problem shift back into HI but unfortunately I was having encoder motor problems at the time and I was left with no tools so I was forced to drive mi home with my diff partially engaged. Thanks for the part number. Ill be ordering one of those kits shortly.,s10,d0h2jwi,1,t5_2stg1

9327570,0,t3_588fhg,I was looking for a stick shift x truck with a decent engine and ended up buying this  Noma with the . for . I had been checking in with a bunch of backyard mechanic shops because Craigslist and used car lots were coming up short and one called me to let me know they had this one. My favorite thing about this truck is that instead of using risers or a proper suspension one of the  previous owners stuck shingles in there to give it some lift. I will try to keep yall posted as I work on it and any resources would be appreciated.,s10,d8yc6c1,1,t5_2stg1

11470259,0,t1_dfw4ftm,Lol I have a pretty clean dash in my  but who ever did the small block swap didnt seem to care about the gauges. Ive got water temp and oil psi down by the floor shifter a big dumb racing tach mounted in the center top of the dash and only the fuel and battery gauges work in the factory dash. I need to make a gauge panel to go into the factory spot to house them all.,s10,dfw5cfb,1,t5_2stg1
