1547395,0,t1_cja4r2u,Agreed. Take Matthew NIVgt His master replied Well done good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your masters happiness!KJVgtHis lord said unto him Well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord.This verse is meant to comfort one facing death or those who have lost a loved one. I think it relates directly to JD describing the loss of his mother and the pain that hes going through and the pain she was going thorugh. Perhaps he read this verse and it gave him comfort during that time. I cant think of any others right now but this one stands out the most in my mind. ,themountaingoats,cja8mst,2,t5_2rr5z

3300539,0,t3_2xvisi,Going to try to pick something I dont see here already good fucking luck amiriteOur love is like a powder keg in the corner of an empty warehouse somewhere just outside of town about to burn down from International Small Arms Traffic Blues because we all know or have known a person like that. Theres going to come a day when you feel better. Youll rise up free and easy on that day and float from branch to branch lighter than the air. Just when that day is coming who can say who can say? from Up the Wolves because when Im going through shit I remember that line and its comforting to hear such a sentiment from JD. In those five minutes my signal was jammed the frequencies that I received were so pure that I almost believed that the sight of the hole in your skull was a thing that my heart could endure from Store because it just flows so well.Speed up to the precipice then slam on the brakes. Some people crash two or three times and then learn from their mistakes. ... Feel the storm every night hope it passes by hallucinate a shady grove where Judas went to die from Cry for Judas the entire song is a masterpiece.Children in the sand outside on their hands and knees sketching pictures all day long of stranger things than these from Tianchi Lake is a perfect ending to such a weird beautiful song.There are tons more that I love Sax Rohmer  is my favorite poem of all time Autoclave is full of beautiful imagery about being fucking lonely and miserable lots of songs from The Sunset Tree resonate with me personally having grown up in an alcoholic household lots of songs from Tallahassee also resonate with me because terrible decision making I could go on forever.

3789896,0,t3_33ayip,Im just going to lean into my lack of originality here and say This Year and Up The Wolves because it seems like when everyones shouting along with those at concerts which I love theyre either not thinking about the darker parts of those two songs stories or are thinking about them but dont care because after all everyones still here. I prefer to think its the latter.The story in This Year is so great because you can read it as this triumphal tale of getting free  if only temporarily but theres promise for the future  or this tale of thinking youre free when theres this incredible foreboding that the narrator telling it in past tense knows about and just barely alludes to. Next year of course you know what happens if youve listened to We Shall All Be Healed andor listened to enough of the live show banter.Likewise Up the Wolves sounds so joyful butjust when that day is comingwho can say who can sayThe narrator in that one is addressing their younger self and you might think its encouragement youll feel better but if youre me it takes a while to realize that the who can say who can say means that the narrator isnt feeling better yet and has no idea when theyre ever going to.SO GREAT,themountaingoats,cqoa0w3,2,t5_2rr5z

4372871,0,t1_csiiupw,gt Side note WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK is with these random psychos latching onto tMG? This is not the first case Ive heard of now.His songs especially his early stuff contain many themes of anger bitterness conflict and angst somehow being beautiful.  Most fans will take away the message of hey even when things are messed up or Im angry theres still beauty in life while others will focus on anger and bitterness IS beautiful.  It makes a lot of sense that a gothic mentality will focus on the second message and not the first.  Doesnt mean that the song is invalidated or that we are somehow wrong for being fans.,themountaingoats,csik3gn,2,t5_2rr5z
