169585,0,t3_1un15d,its not at all surprising that you remember genesis most clearly in many ways i think its the least enigmatic book in the bible. it also establishes themes that are continued throughout the entire text but are also challenged in the most fascinating ways. most notably is the idea of the chosen one which is established in abel noah via seth abels brother and adams son abram abraham isaac jacob and joseph. later this idea is reiterated in the likes of david who is a complicated hero but nonetheless is certainly chosen and favored while legendary job completely challenges confuses and enriches this fundamental biblical idea.if we hope to discuss the bible as both as a literary and religious text its important right off the bat to acknowledge that the authors of this text are disputed and unverifiableone theory puts a female author at the center of the bibles creation which is interesting. i need to brush up on these theories but theyre good to keep in mind if we want to talk about the language of the text and even how certain books might suggest a specific style or author.excited to begin!,biblstudy,cexqyxf,1,t5_2zktg
