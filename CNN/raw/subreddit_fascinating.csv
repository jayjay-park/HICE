3116651,0,t1_cokr4ua,How is that different from any age where one side had a technological edge over the other? Guns vs. melee weapons siege weapons vs. strongholds strongholds vs. wandering nomadic tribes. Theres always an edge and a successful military learns to exploit that edge. And whats more that edge is often gained by investing in technologies that take resources away from other endeavors so its not a completely unearned thing.Id much rather be against war than against technology in war.,fascinating,col1gr7,3,t5_2qh9m

5206040,0,t1_cvdfmbt,Did you read it? This is taken from part  of that link gt  The new site uses a pseudorandom number generating algorithm to produce the books in a seemingly random distribution without needing to store anything on disk. Though I considered similar methods when I was starting out at the time I lacked the mathematical knowledge and programming abilities to see how to realize it while remaining true to the story. I needed an algorithm regular enough to create the same block of text in the same place every time yet randomseeming enough that no user would notice patterns moving from one page to the next.gt It would be easy enough to use any programming languages builtin random number generator to accomplish this task. With a few exceptions theres no real randomness in computing  a random number generator is just a deterministic equation which produces different values by starting from a different input each time. This input is called the random seed and a computers system time is often used to guarantee a changing value. It would have been possible to create a sizeable library by using the books location hexagon wall shelf and volume as a random seed thus guaranteeing the same page in the same place every time.gt However I had grown quite attached to the idea of having a searchable library. For this to be possible the algorithm I chose needed to be invertible as well. This means that for any block of text the program can work backwards to calculate its location in the library the random seed which would produce that output. I couldnt help but feel that the result was a computerage form of gematria converting text to numbers and back again to text.gt It took a significant amount of experimentation to find an algorithm capable of meeting these requirements and producing  unique values. One of my early attempts used a Halton sequence which produces a pseudorandom distribution by creating fractions evenly distributed between  and  which I then multiplied by a number around . Ive been working with C whose native data types only store numbers of up to  bits which is about  digits in base . The library requires working with values of around  digits or  bits.gt Even using a multiprecision library capable of calculating with numbers of that size any division operations made invertibility impossible. Its difficult to represent decimal values in computing because infinite base series are represented by a finite binary sequence. A tiny amount of information was lost every time the operation was performed which made inversion impossible.gt I found a successful formula combining modular arithmetic and bitshifting operations and the result is the library you see today. To date I have never witnessed a search fail though I hope that if any reader comes across something which appears erroneous she will bring it to my attention. Of course if  visitors each made a hundred page requests per day it would require  years to test every possible value contained in the library.gt Imagine a demiurge were to create the shoreline of earths continents not with the coarse tools we use in constructing artificial beaches but with enough resolution to know each grain of sand by name and recall its exact location when asked for it. The pages of rational text which this algorithm can locate are rarer than a single grain of sand in that collection yet intrinsically no more meaningful.,fascinating,cvdiqwt,1,t5_2qh9m
