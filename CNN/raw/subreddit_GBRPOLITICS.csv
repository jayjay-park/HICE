1352569,0,t3_29kpqs,The policy of devolving so much money is actually a Labour policy id be behind. But he answered the question dreadfully.he essentially answered the question of how will you prevent local authorities being wasteful by saying we will tell them how to spend the money lol.The answer should have been its up to the local people to elect the local authorities and elect people that wont create a new layer of bureaucracy. Of course if he had said that he may as well have said dont vote for Labour. I wonder if he sees the irony of saying local people make better decisions on the one hand but then supporting the European project on the other. ,GBRPOLITICS,cilu3r8,-1,t5_31m65
