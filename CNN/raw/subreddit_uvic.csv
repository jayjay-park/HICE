396820,0,t1_cflanie,HeyaIt has to be World of Warcraft for a number of reasons. From a research perspective I need to try to control the environment as much as possible. If I am judging language performance after a set time  hours  week I need some way to determine that players will only play for this amount of time. I cant have one group play for  hours one group play for  hours and another for  hours etc. If that happened I cant compare the results. World of Warcraft gives me parental controls over participants accounts. That way I can set a  hour limit each week.I personally play League but from my experience it is a far less communicative game. With the new pinging system the chat is mostly unnecessary and saved for trash talking the speed of the game also prohibits actual conversation and finally  no parental controls.  ,uvic,cflwa0b,1,t5_2ru8r

3021317,0,t3_2uqbig,I doubt theyll transfer the meal card balance it doesnt hurt to ask though but when I lived in res they would mail you a cheque for the unused portion at the end of the year. This is probably different now that they have the onecard but still if you arent returning to UVic Im sure youll get a refund.You have until February th Sunday to drop courses and receive  of the tuition back. Source. Normally this would be applied to future semesters but if youre not returning to UVic I think there is a process to receive a check for that too. Thats the kind of thing an academic adviser can help you with I think.Speaking of academic advisers this would be a really good idea if youre planning to apply to another postsecondary institution I noticed youre thinking about U of C and SAIT. It would be helpful to talk about what to do moving forward whether or not a number of withdrawals on your record might impact your transfer that sort of thing. They have sameday appointments on Friday well and today but they might be booked up  make sure you arrive at  AM.Im not sure what your reasons are for withdrawing but to reiterate what utheoneness said if youre feeling overwhelmed or depressed or just unwell in any way its really important to talk to someone. Counseling Services completely free has same day appointments and walkins and I can attest to their awesomeness. You can get same day appointments at the clinic if you visit at  or call at . If youre leaving for reading break I would recommend doing this today or tomorrow and leave Friday open in case you decide to see the academic adviser.I hope everything works out for you.

I think the best way to describe the class in a single sentence would be to call it a philosophical analysis on what it means to be creative. The class consists of lectures and tutorials. The lectures often have guest speakers come in and talk about various topics. The tutorials are basically a teacher helping a group of students discuss what they got out of the lectures. The majority of your mark comes from a journal that you write EVERYTHING down in. Youre going to want to write every little thought that pops into your head down because you need that thing to be filled to the brim with your thoughts. You have to attend several events outside of class time such as plays art exhibits concerts etc. The exam is quite simple and is really just there because its a university requirement. There is a final project that you do with your tutorial members. You all have complete freedom over what you want to do for it. Like literally anything. You guys wanna spend your  minutes playing catch in front of an audience you can go right ahead.Its certainly not for everyone but if what I described sounds like something youd enjoy youll probably get a lot out of it. Its not exactly an easy A but if you put in the work and take it seriously youre going to do just fine in it.Feel free to ask me some questions if you want more details.,uvic,crx0442,2,t5_2ru8r

It is easy to disregard what does not affect you. This type of work is personal and requires reflection and frankly some men may not ever come to place of selfreflection to see how they may or may not contribute to some of the issues. The problems raised by the these groups are not new. Rather they are louder than ever before I believe and it is uncomfortable.There will always be reactionary stances and people who take things to far but these cannot be cause to disregard meaningful work.Once you can see the culture of entitlement domination and insecure unhealthy hyper masculinity represented in media and in person around you you will see things differently. ,uvic,cxm1tbb,-8,t5_2ru8r

8669140,0,t1_d42n4md,This is odd. UBF is always surrounded by controversy oddities and depression. This has been the case since they started in Korea in  and came to North America in . The Winnipeg chapter was shut down with police involvement way back in the s and s. Their semiChristian theology is a theology of sacrifice and selfindoctrination mixed in with Confucian values and Buddhist philosophy. Confucius and Buddha have much to learn from but it is a dangerous and toxic mix of the three faiths that UBF teaches. They call it kingdom of priests and holy nation KOPAHN. They rope students into massive time commitments coerce students to cut ties with boyfriendsgirlfriendsfamily and hide many cases of abusive training like walking barefoot  miles in the winter. The group is closed to outsiders except by special invitation. They are all about scripting a students life to conform to I was a sinner before UBF and Now my life is so blessed because I accepted onetoone Bible study at UBF. The authoritarian control over a students life is done in such a way that the student really believes they are making their own decision. But the goal is always to pressure a student into their holy grail which is arranged marriage. UBF calls the process marriage by faith. If a student likes another person especially an outsider the student will be slated to receive marriage by faith training. The Korean missionaries pressure students to make lifealtering decisions such as I skipped my exam by faith! And now God will bless me with good grades! or I did not go home to see my dying father by faith! And now let the dead bury their own dead and I will choose to be with the living servants of God in UBF!. Always there is a prooftext quote of a Bible verse. The Bible becomes a binding agent to seal the students decisions. If a student does not keep his own decision absolutely they are trained with dead dog training to teach obedience.The selfindoctrination is through weekly sogam testimony sharing weekly meetings that never end and mandatory Sunday services. They claim to want only one hour per week of a students time but they boil the frog until the student is willing to commit  or  or more hours every week to the group for free of course. They train sheep to be shepherds in a pyramid scheme authority structure. Smaller chapters dont have much of a pyramid but they just need  student to become the Abraham of faith or the Mother of prayer for Canada or whatever country they are in.Full disclosure I am a former UBF leader Brian Karcher and have written  books about the group in order to expose them. ,uvic,d6p9gy7,1,t5_2ru8r
