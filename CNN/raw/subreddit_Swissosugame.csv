7856904,0,t1_d3yllu8,Lets define terms then A map is streamheavy if at least  of its drain time is dominated by streams with only minor interruptions by kicksliders and the like. Streams are defined as sequences of hit circles placed at a constant time interval that the player is expected to alternate with a constant or only minimally changing distance snap.Im pretty sure these definitions should be something we can agree on and that under these definitions at least Haelequin I dont know F.I is considered streamheavy.EDIT also stop arguing without bringing any real arguments and write up the match schedule already,Swissosugame,d3z6qto,5,t5_38o9w
