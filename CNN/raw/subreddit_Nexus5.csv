7153,0,t1_ceez7ik,Nandroid backups will keep a full backup of everything... I think. Ive restored nandroid backups and had all my user data intact. But its not very accessible for restoring individual appsdata  you want Titanium Backup for that and of youre rooting you may as well use Titanium. You dont have to keep a nandroid backup on your device but you may as well unless youre really pressed for space. Im a semioffline music guy. I use Subsonic and have a GB cache for the music. I still keep a nandroid backup or two or three or four or... I should really clean this up on the device. But I have the GB N not sure which you have. Sideloading might nuke your entire device including user data so definitely to nandroid and titanium backups before you try anything like that and offload those to a computer! ,Nexus5,cef91ho,2,t5_2v4cu

665008,0,t3_21qn05,I honestly can not imagine that you have to have a specific android version installed on your phone to run sailfish os.Installing a os on a phone is very similar to installing one on a PC. You have different partitions with different OS and they do not interact with each other. For example if you install a Linux OS on a second partition of your windows notebook the windows version does not matter at all.Just wait for a sailfish port for the nexus  and maybe also wait for corresponding MultiROM version so you can easily go back to android if you are not satisfied. ,Nexus5,cgfuzsp,3,t5_2v4cu

Similarly here Android is warning you that an app has commandeered the entire touchscreen UI and making sure you know how to return to OS control if it starts behaving badly.

Also when I check weather on Google Now it shows a neighboring area unless I go into Google maps wait for it to pinpoint my location then refresh Google now.

798008,0,t1_cguyh05,As I understand it Fully draining the battery is helpful once in a while  it recalibrates the battery meter so that it can more accurately predict the batterys remaining capacity. Basically the battery meter has two variables to go on watthours used and current voltage. It gives the percentage remaining of the battery by looking at those two variables in the context of its remember historical data. If the battery is never allowed to go all the way to empty it doesnt really know how much energy the battery can hold.Full discharges are bad for lithium batteries though so youre better off only intentionally discharging it if you think that the meter isnt accurate. Most people probably inadvertently drain their batteries often enough that its not an issue.,Nexus5,cguzj1n,3,t5_2v4cu

If you can get around that say by bypassing the TV and going straight to your speakers I think that would be more ideal. Assuming you solved that AND I didnt read this wrong youre looking for a receiver right? this has always had great reviews but on the expensive side Whereas this is a new player to the game but also has high reviews and is about half the price Hope this helps,Nexus5,chao0p0,1,t5_2v4cu

1008866,0,t3_25nok2,Its running CM. Sure you could change the ROM when devs eventually work on it but the variety of the dev community most likely wont ever be as good as the Nexus . Customer service replacements RMAs etc. are going to be terrible in comparison if you have any issues with your phone. They can barely produce them in decent quantities dont have the financial backing Google does and will probably be far less effective at dealing with problems.Its also invite only so the only way to get one is from someone else who already has one giving you an invite. Updates youre stuck with CMs timeline. The Nexus line is always first in line if that matters to you.Accessories if you think the Nexus  has a small selection in comparison to other brands good luck with the .

There is a native android backup that runs on your PC from Google. Runs over adb and requires the command prompt.... But Ive discovered that the easiest way to do theses backups is with wugs nexus toolkit.

1361951,0,t3_29omxp,If you want to update via OTA you have to have an unmodified system which means youd need to unroot and undo ANY other changes you made to the system. Bootloader is fine though.If you have modified your system at all it is preferable to do the Factory Image method.If you want to update to .. and then to .. using Factory Image this is what you do in short Get the factory image. Uncompress it the .GZ and then the .TAR. Edit flashall.bat and remove the w from the fastboot flash line. this prevents wipe. With your phone connected in the boot loader run flashall.bat and wait.You will lose root and need to reroot using Wugs toolkit or other method. Bootloader wont change so no need to fix that.If you did step  you wont need to wipe. Now Ive given you the brief version. If you need more help..... well... good luck ,Nexus5,cin0dk2,1,t5_2v4cu

Plug your phone in . Head into device manager . Find your device  should be under ADB devices or something similar if you cant find it unplug and replug to see what changes . Rightclick and go to properties . Go to the Driver tab and click update driver . Click browse my computer and select let me pick . Select MTP ADB is causing the problem and click next then your device storage should pop up in a window. Problem solved!,Nexus5,ck0vpr9,5,t5_2v4cu

2427499,0,t3_2n8x27,I got the update naturally? My phone wasnt rooted and i didnt have to rely on other teams. If you dont like the update you could always revert back to kitkat in fact if you own a nexus device google lets you do this without having to root. Okay yeah the battery isnt great but the nexus  is known for having poor battery life compared to other smart phones on the market. Its not the worst but its not the best either. The update for me was perfectly fine. Everything including SMS worked well. Ive had no issues what so ever. Everythings smooth and all my apps work well. I guess its luck of the draw. Some devices get good updates some get bad. Its not just an android thing. I remember when my friends updated their iphones to iOS . Some had good updates but others had bad.Im sure google will sort these problems out in time just be patient. Their probably just waiting for others devices to get the updates or something before they do an update fix.    ,Nexus5,cmbqv6o,1,t5_2v4cu

2651191,0,t3_2qbm7j,No. Theres a chip inside the phone that turns off charging when the battery is full.  The amount of electricity being used is minimal and just gets dissipated as heat in the phones charging circuit. I actually had  my Nexus charging circuit fail and it melted the USB cord.  The wireless charging still worked and the battery was fine too.  But that was a freak occurrence probably due to a faulty component.  Thats what the tech at Google said anyways.  The point is that the battery is highly protected and leaving the phone on the charger isnt going to do anything.,Nexus5,cn4n3ua,25,t5_2v4cu

3605196,0,t3_31n4jf,As a counterpoint what drove me to buy an S was the N itself. I image a reasonable percentage of Nexus owners are moving on to something a little more topshelf. Dont get me wrong I have loved the N since the month after it was released. It has been very good to me but it is time for me to move on. Heres why.  Im a beta tester. Yup. I am. I always thought I wanted to be on the forefront of Android updates but in practice I cant say it has been that great. Launcher redraws still plague my device even after . though the have certainly decreased. My phone goes from being the smoothest phone Ive ever owned to being the laggiest phone Ive ever owned depending on what is going on with my memory management. Im sure it will get fixed for good but Im just plain tired of it already. . My camera is hit or miss and the autofocus in almost laughably bad sometimes. My sister has a Note . If we are together somewhere and I want a picture of something I just ask her to take it. She takes one of two photos and were done. Great photo. If we take a photo at the same time hers is better  of the time. But okay I knew that when I signed up. But still I miss taking great photos. It is possible to put a great camera in a phone. It is possible to make great software to control the hardware. The Nexus  just isnt the place to find either of those things. . Stock Android actually isnt perfect. Maybe Im getting long in the tooth but the older I get the more I kind of miss the additions that manufacturer skins provide. I know that is heresy and it pains me to admit it. I feel like with TouchWiz especially in its newest form you get more OS functionality at the cost of beauty. Stock Android is the best LOOKING version of the OS but I dont really think it is the most featurerich. In fact it isnt. If it ran lighting fast on my device I wouldnt have much to complain about but see . So Ill give up some beauty to have a silent mode again. I am willing to make that trade. In conclusion the Nexus  has been a great phone. As a piece of electronics it was the best  I ever spent. I have zero regrets. But N is nothing if not spartan. Having lived with some compromises for the last year and a half Im ready to move on to something a little more luxurious. And thats okay. Thats the whole reason why I chose Android in the first place. ,Nexus5,cq37v6q,30,t5_2v4cu

4629724,0,t3_3eea4z,I dont have the issue with my nexus  but my Samsung captivate had that issue I called it my capacitive power button because it was so sensitive. Im not going to recommend this you could cause damage to your phone and may break it further. With that out of the way I would power off my phone pull the battery out too and pull it apart as much as possible and then drop some methylated spirits into the power button then hold the phone with power button facing down and click it a whole bunch of times. Pulling the battery is best so the phone doesnt turn on midway through.Repeat from dropping the liquid on the power button about  or more times.The idea is that the methylated spirits wont affect the pcb and circuitry of the phone and will basically just wash away the grit nearon your power button.

For eg it can take  mp pictures in a sec which means  fps mp video. On a phone the software has a lot to do with how the photos turn up.

The mic is under the right side. There is no speaker under the right side of holes. There is no volume coming from the right side of the holes. There never was.

The Redmi  pro is a beast and the MIUI is actually really good thus far. Props to xiaomi for addressing most of my complaints with the MIUI and I can only imagine in one or two years what I could get for that money.  phones are not worth it not anymore at least.Only thing I would really want on my N is fingerprint scanner...,Nexus5,d81pfgs,1,t5_2v4cu

If the wires look damaged an end pulled off partially kinked etc. then replace the wires.  If the antenna looks damaged replace it.  If nothing looks damaged Id start with the daughter board as its got the most places to go wrong.  Either way its basically a guessing game.

But the Pixel has a similar bug so Im not sure if its a Nougat thing or a Z thing.Besides that Google Camera doesnt work so I use Open Camera. Its been solid for stuff that usually causes problems eg it hooks up to Android Auto without a hitch Bluetooth has been solid etc. Happy to test anything in particular if you wanna check something.If youre gonna buy it definitely double check to see if it supports all your LTE bands.,Nexus5,df0pira,1,t5_2v4cu
