It also has had a history of underreserving. Whether it is adequately reserved now is not something we will know but not a chance I would be willing to take.gt ...and the insurance sector pretty much requires Asia to do well in order to achieve its predicted growth.Asia is one area that can help drive growth but keep in mind that there continues to be lots of innovation in the insurance sector. Insurance linked securities continue to become more prevalent and with regulation like Solvency II more insurers may look to reinsurers to provide solutions to their capital needs.gt ...equivalent to buying a bond fund which is where the money yield is coming fromBecause its combined ratio is less than  it is making money on its underwriting activities and from its investments not just the bonds they invest in.,InvestmentClub,ch2jbrq,4,t5_2tfzh

2816362,0,t1_cnnxadu,Im not sure.   Im thinking it may be because of the additional code for the SampP tab.   Each cell that has a formula in it requires a web call.   Ill back up the worksheet and delete that page to see if it makes a difference.   I put a post on rinvesting to see if anyone knows a good way to present that information. ,InvestmentClub,cno7opv,1,t5_2tfzh

Honestly in this day and age with so many easy recipes on the internet and home grocery delivery people are realizing how much money you can save by planning your meals ahead.And I agree the article is pure clickbait chalk it up to poor research rather than some super awesome generational secret,InvestmentClub,cs1oc3o,4,t5_2tfzh
5523533,0,t1_cwhnrc8,Are you investing in the company or looking to make money in the near term that really is what should be factoring into your decision. As a company GE is investing in industrials energy sources and all sorts of technologies. Whereas Synchrony is financial services of which I dont know a lot about but I assume they finance debt related to the purchases of GE products and broader markets once they are removed from GE.One thing worth considering is GE was hammered in  largely in part of their financial services read Synchrony and shedding this is a part of their efforts to focus on their core business. The decision is up to you to determine which fits your goals risk appetite etc...,InvestmentClub,cwhoiv9,1,t5_2tfzh

Two and six months who knows  there might be dips there although theres nothing to suggest that.  Theres no reason that the SampP shouldnt be higher in twelve months than it is now.That and  will get a you a coffee from Starbucks.,InvestmentClub,d1whoe9,6,t5_2tfzh

10637844,0,t1_ddcz41p,Thats nonsense.  You dont need less people.  Jobs arent the end all be all.In an ideal world everyone would go to collegetrade school and specialize in something that cant be done by a computer plumbing IT programming HVAC electrician scientist.And then since theres more people with these skills than demand wed all work part time and wed be able to afford basic living costs because food and clothing and construction cost almost nothing due to automation.In practice were really bad at making this transition.  A yearold that gets laid off from a manufacturing job doesnt want to go back to college to learn a new skill.  And our politicians try to focus on telling people we can go backwards because it makes people feel better and push policies that make the inequality worse because they were decent ideas before automation.,InvestmentClub,ddd7n9e,1,t5_2tfzh
