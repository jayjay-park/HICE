2329654,0,t3_2lzoug,No but i think the Zombies team needs to get more resources to be able to make more content at this point as its far from a passing after thought.  If you just buy a Treyarch game for the Zombie stuff  Maps a year is not worth .... so even if they could just make the MP maps usable with Zombie stuff as a simple survival mode along with the full special made maps it would be a huge value boost.  They could even tailor the SP campaign to replace soldiers with Zombies and cut out QTEs as an easter egg for finishing on Veteran.,CODZombies,clznpat,1,t5_2sal9

3771017,0,t3_33lo1a,Ive made to round  I believe me and my friend went through the triple toxic  times successfully. The key to it is while you are making your way up the rounds be sure both of you have disraction drones and atleast  camo. Make sure atleast  of you has the cel also if not both of you.     Me and my friend BOTH ran trains in the sewer water together. The key to that is let the horde stay close on your back and make your way around trying to stay in the water and jumping on the edge if needed to pass a zombie. Limit exo movement AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Getting empd in there is asking for it. Prioritize EMP zombies so they cant do that.     Use the alligator as often as possible. When you are going around the corner to it and you see its usable one of you run forward and activate it and one stay back close to the horde.    Pick running in whatever direction you feel comfortable with. The way me and friend ran around since only him had a cel was him looking back at the horde shooting them and me looking forward. If anything spawned infront that I couldnt kill I would tell him to turn so he can make his way past the zombies. Communication and trust is key in the sewers.     Also you will probably go down during this for atleast your first time. Communicate if you are about to go down so your partner can prepare himself if he needs to save you. Losing perks in the sewers is no good.  TLDR Both get disraction drones try to both get cels get atleast  camo. Use alligator as much as possible. Dont exo boost to not get EMPd. Prioritize your life but if you are about to go down say something so your partner can save you. Communication is KEY.,CODZombies,cqm4gj0,2,t5_2sal9

Honestly I think the only existing animosity will be between Richtofen and the others as he has his own agenda shown when he kills the alternate version of himself.The other three want to set certain events in motion while Richtofen wants to completely erase parts of history.This makes me think Richtofen has some other goals possibly nefarious in nature.

5484775,0,t1_cwcmc9k,Yeah it can be done well and a lot better than TranZit but there is a certain containment I like about zombies.I think my biggest concern is that a map doesnt need to be large to feel grand. For example I started playing a little after the PC release for Moon and I had all BOs maps at my disposal. My favorite one was Der Riese because it felt so grand. Der Riese is no where near the size of Ascension or Call of the Dead and yet it had the atmosphere and layout nailed down absolutely perfectly. The point is I think theres a way to feel grand without being unnecessarily big. I just want to make sure theyre focusing on content and less on just having marketing material because simply working on marketing material from TranZit... didnt go overly well,CODZombies,cwcqbte,2,t5_2sal9

Open st gate to rd ritual location and get artefact . train to rd ritual site and do ritual  my preference for this site is footlight . Train to th ritual site . Open nd gate at th ritual site  do ritual  enter rift. Theoretically you can access PaP on round  in a  player game if everyone participates in the first  rituals getting them  each ritual. You just have to make excellent use of your beasts and make sure you get ritual site and artefact available at each location with a single beast. Dont waste time on extra things like the statues or unnecessary rifts the easiest site for location  is waterfront as the beast has plenty of time to smash artefact box rift then gym doors. ,CODZombies,cwxb1q7,2,t5_2sal9

5653079,0,t3_3sjhi3,I was super frustrated when I first tried SOE. The silent zombies were super sneaky and I had no clue where they would spawn. But after playing for awhile I think it makes it more fun and challenging. You will get a feel for where they spawn after playing enough. There are spots you can safely stand but they are few to come by especially after all doors are open The shield is a priority and if your doing the rituals for PaP right away it is super easy to grab the pieces and build. Once you have that shield you can worry less about silent zombies behind you. It would be really cool to see a gobble gum that gave you heightened sensesound awareness.

Personally I dont mind the expansion of the story in BO and think the idea of the Origins  going back to Der Riese to change the events of the future is pretty neat even if it makes things more complicated but I dont know how I feel about the new enemies in SoE. For the most part up until Origins and even a little after it the story was this one arc with no other enemies other than the characters themselves with Richtofen and Maxis causing all the chaos within the world on their own but now with SoE I dont know how I feel with other supernatural entities and forces being brought into play I know its a weird thing to have qualms about in a story with timetraveling Nazis but having these completely separate enemies and factions doesnt feel like it fits personally. ,CODZombies,cxfxi0s,1,t5_2sal9

You guys know how your screen turns darker when you are standing next to the shot of the WW? When I got back up my screen remained dark. For a couple of rounds I thought to myself that it was just me being dumb. Next game I played I could tell a difference. Also apparently when a margwa is near you the strange guy starts talking.

On SoE that means you get  extra powered guns with speedy reloads as well as extra health and at least  mini explosions per round when hit. Not to mention increased stamina and faster revive time.If there were any way to achieve that otherwise I may feel different but as it stands the only way to get more than  perks on SoE is to use gobblegums.,CODZombies,cxzt370,11,t5_2sal9

How is me pointing that out being dramatic?You posted that you did not think it was upgradable at all and not just the one method did not work.Also quit fucking misquoting me. I never said anything regarding the FF files except for this gtWe do not have any of the FF files decrypted to view any of the GSC files no one has upgraded the weapon to actually know the steps and the strings people are fixated on might actually be leftover code of an unused function BUT it may also still be used. That is literally nothing of what you claimed I said.Once again I never said debugging is  useless like you keep going on about. Quit being so childish and making everything a drama post about you. My main intent on this post was that there could still be a small script used for upgrading. After your post I have seen too many other comments of people stating there is nothing else and telling people its a fact. That right there was another reason for me posting.gtI will go ahead and let this post die out quickly as it will as it offers nothing.Thanks for making another asshole comment tho . Please do not respond anymore as you only misquote me which is getting pretty pathetic at this point. Also stop acting like a god of reverse engineering in this subreddit and making everything about you. This isnt a circle jerk subreddit about drama ffs.Also if you read my entire post it is not a flame post. The only data mine topics posted recently about the topic I am talking about was all information that supposedly and from your post confirming was you. So how else can I go about the topic without bringing you up at all?

The sword has these for greets first time use combat certain triggers hit when killing shit. The WW is no different it also has these but for the most part most of the apothicon ambient sounds arent used. My guess is so they can be used later or they simply wont be used at all. Currently the WW only uses the greet sounds and ready upgrade sounds with nothing else.I believe this apothicon shit is here in zombies to stay and we will be hearing and seeing a lot more of it in each map.,CODZombies,cys7q4z,1,t5_2sal9
6181540,0,t1_cys3pcj,Double Tap .s effects are that you shoot two bullets for the price of one and that your firerate is higher.  Imagine a wall. You have a gun and double tap .. You hipfire a bullet. Because you shoot two bullets per one what appears on the wall? Two bullets that do normal damage. Now youre aiming down sight. You shoot another bullet into the wall. Since hip fire spread is negated while aiming down sight you only see one bullet hole. Since Double Tap . fires  bullets for one even though you only see one bullet hole your gun actually fired two. Two bullets that are literally fired at the same time from the same gun means double the damage. Double Tap . doesnt necessarily give you double damage it just gives you two for one bullets. ,CODZombies,cys9yzq,3,t5_2sal9

6189902,0,t1_cyt5g65,Regarding you having troubles with training on the Giant it just isnt viable on some maps and the Giant is one of them. Two friends and I played two games one where we all trained in different rooms one where we camped on the catwalk. When we trained one was in the courtyard one in the Thompson room and I was in the first room. We made it to round  before we all couldnt handle it anymore and died. When we camped on the catwalk we got to  with no problems at all. The only problem with camping on the catwalk is that getting the guns you want can take some time. Ray gun is also mostly trash as it can create crawlers and kill you with splash damage. For example my ideal gun set is Drakon Dingo and  Dredge. With LMGs having at least  rounds of ammo you can last a long long time without even moving from the catwalk. ,CODZombies,cyt8694,3,t5_2sal9

6322673,0,t3_42792u,I feel like the main difference in Origins setup and SoE setup is really just how mind numbingly easy it is and running around. You can be extremely efficient with the generators but itll still be round six or seven before you get them all. SoE you can get everything done by round  which is obviously preferable because you want to get setup out of the way ASAP. Additionally in Origins everything is pretty condensed and doesnt require going back and forth between lanes you open a door and the generator is right in front of you. In shadows you have to open a door do a beast mode grab an item open another door do a ritual then run all the way back before opening another door. At least in Origins you can kill zombies during this because you need the points.,CODZombies,cz8bhco,3,t5_2sal9

After a while people noticed that the machine had a different logo for Double Tap and was labeled Double Tap II on one part of the machine and Double Tap . on another part. What does it do? Well in addition to increasing your fire rate any bullet based gun will shoot two bullets for the price of one. It is extremely noticeable when hip firing a sniper because youll see two bullet trails. When ADS of a bullet gun it negates bullet spread. This means that when ever you ADS with a bullet gun whilst having Double Tap . you effectively do double the damage. This perk was a must have to get to high rounds in Black Ops  before they introduced some of the wonder weapons in that game. ,CODZombies,czcr9ao,3,t5_2sal9

6496076,0,t3_44mcl4,In WaW zombies it was contained outbreaks where most the world was living normally unknowing of the zombies. Small outbreaks like Nacht Vurruckt Shi No Numa and Der Riese. All these places are secluded away from large populations. In Black Ops  the outbreaks were getting bigger. Berlin Kino An entire jungle Shangrila and Washington DC. Five Now with these bigger outbreaks the world was in panic though a majority of people were carrying on with their lives. Most of the population on the Earth were unaffected. Then the four original characters blew up the earth. Now it wasnt just secluded outbreaks. Most the people on the planet were dead. And regular people The TranZit survivors the CDC and the CIA were now having to fight zombies daily to survive. A full apocalypse. But in this new timeline even though the earth was never exploded it seems as though the earth is more zombie populated than not. Though group  seems to be still in working condition and many of them seem to be left alive. As noted by Takeo on Der Eisendrache.

6499626,0,t1_czrai96,I find SOE not as enjoyable as other maps just because of the split second mess ups that will waste so much of your time. Yes I know zombies is all about those split second mess ups and thats usually how people die but a one hit kill from those margwas? I would be fine if it was something like one hit gives you the red screen and if another zombie hits you then youll get downed but after spending  mins trying to get everything set up on early rounds and then it all goes to waste because of a singular attack from a margwa. I love narrow escapes and just squeezing through I find it more fun that large circles for hours on end. Makes the game more intense and rewarding for making it out of those close calls. If you try to do that with the margwa through it can just do that OP ground pound and get you sent back. I know how to do almost everything on SOE  I can get pap by round  sometimes but usually I prefer to let it go to round  so I can choose a gun I like to PAP not just get the meat wagon so I can say I got pap round . The map is a very well done one but I just prefer not to deal with the margwas. It doesnt make it unplayable by any means and its not too big of a deal where if they dont change anything Ill get pissed off but I hope they look to the community and dont make a boss like that again like with the Panzer so many people hated the claw and they took that out on DE kinda but also added the electric nades and changed the weak point to a harder target so for those that want change expect Arc to throw in some other aspects to make the boss still difficult ,CODZombies,czrlzch,2,t5_2sal9

Also nice to have a bank that allowed me to get set up really quickly each time I played one full loop and Im good to go. My highest solo round achieved in all of zombies was on Tranzit.

I want a spreadsheet A where the first column is the mega gum  rows pre DLC.  Next columns are different videos where people spin  at a time  or more LD with a tally of their totals.  After all those the next column sums up all the totals for each gum.  The final column is a percent chance that youd get each one. Then some analysis could be done on the percentage chance of getting each gum type.Id have a similar spreadsheet B for  LD at a time with final percentages there and compare the  results.There is no doubt that you get more gums total doing  LD spins.  But the question is does the nd and rd vat give you a higher rare percentage chance?  People dont think so but its not proven.  Im not sure since vat  has more machinery on top and vat  has the most like they get more powerful.  Id even like to see a spreadsheet C showing what shows up in each vat    regardless of numbers of LD spent to see if vat  gets better stuff than .I spend  LD  at a time and went from thisto thisComparing before and after mega gum screenshots seems to be the fastest way to tally results for spreadsheets A and B.,CODZombies,czw3lw4,1,t5_2sal9

6547721,0,t1_czwki6s,I was mainly referring to black ops . The Jet Gun actually killed zombies at one point by doing a little trick where you prerevved it while changing weapons. It made tranzit actually really fun to play for a while. After the change high rounds became pretty much impossible and the map basically withered. Then there was the sliquifier which for a while the zombies didnt drop slippery goo when they died by it.

6551746,0,t1_czwzf0s,In five years from now Black Ops  would be revealed if Call of Duty continues this three year development cycle and I think Zombies will be around but if it is not innovated properly like with what people are complaining about with Multiplayer the community will die. I think to prevent this Zombies needs some type of successful DayZ esque gamemode in which people come in for that gamemode rather than for the main game being ARMA . From what Ive heard they are supposedly continuing Zombies to Black Ops  No confirmation on Black Ops  or DLC  just yet even though the main storyline will be finishing in Black Ops . Simplicity is usually the key to success thank you Khaled when it comes to the mostplayed games on the market but Treyarch is smart and I have faith in them.SIDE NOTEA group of people and I are working on a miniproject for Competitive Zombies once ModTools release for Black Ops  PC stay tuned.,CODZombies,czx064n,10,t5_2sal9

If he catches you and a zombies hits you gg youre down. George does suck but as you get into higher rounds hes super easy to kill. As for the astronaut past round  he is impossible to kill. Dont take my word for it look on the zombie records website. Moon is the only map that has a separate solo leaderboard for glitching out the astronaut. Also after you kill george you get a wunderwaffe and a perk. What happened after you kill the astronaut? You get a giant fuck you cause you just wasted all your bullets and he is coming back next round.,CODZombies,d0cg1ls,1,t5_2sal9

But then I guess not many people use every gun they happen to get and many of them love AATs.And yeah Ive watched that video commented on it and downvoted it. Mostly because of what he said about LMGs supposedly having always been very strong in Treyarch games.gthave fun with it and see how high you can goNo limit to that I mean as long as wall guns are allowed you can simply run the spawn in The Giant with a PaPd RK then it becomes about patience.

A dingo with speed cola is great on the catwalk up until round ish which is when you should start training. Shotguns like the brecci and haymaker are really good too. On Der Eisendrache I usually use a VMP or a KN with blast furnacedeadwire and the storm bow. If youre going for the EE a PAP raygunhaymaker works great on the boss battle.

6853340,0,t1_d0sc7cd,Sure but Dead wire activates waaaay more often so unless you wait for the full  and snake around to bunch them up real tight I think dead wire is better. you can just fire it away whenever theres a few zombies and take out less but more often which I think is faster kills overall.I guess it depends on the map though On The Giant I find it harder to train and so Id rather blast furnace after waiting for the full . On DE Id prefer dead wire cause the training spots are way more open and so you can just kill them in smaller groups as they come in without as much risk IMO,CODZombies,d0t4ujq,1,t5_2sal9

If it helps this is the video I used as my guide But my tactic against the boss was to only kill the skeletons if they were in my way or if I needed to recharge my ragnarok. If my ragnarok was not recharged by the time the keeper did his lightning attack Id hide behind a pillar and fire  storm bow shot to keep the skeletons off me I also did the same thing with the pillars if I had put my ragnarok in the middle because on Public one time when I put it down I dont think it worked properly because the electric attack ended up killing all of us As for the panzers I would just keep them behind me and occasionally turn around and spam my brecci into them.

6906271,0,t1_d0yxxef,Your logic would be invalid here. Youve already released the lever. In five seconds if you dont throw or press triangle you die. The game suggests youve taken out the pin released the lever and then... depressed the lever and replace the pin? Yeah no. Why dont you just... Not allow the gears to turn by stopping the winding key like all wind up toys work? I mean this is a game where weve just blown up the moon and we havent been IMMEDIATELY killed by tsunamis. Im ok with game mechanics just saying we cant but you REALLY cant says its illogical to just stop the winding key. Edit In fact this would be more logical and tactical.

From supporting the ambassador program to reddit twitter facebook livechat and the support forums they have a lot of good folks over there some more specialized than others one who left recently named Dan was a total pro at fixing issues and one of the nicest guys I have met in years.Before I ramble to much from my experience communicating with the folks over there I now know the Support team at ATVI are great folks which is a shame as the corporate side of Activision is light years away from them.And OP is right the reason they ask questions and taught me the same process is to narrow down what the issue is when a user comes in chat and says The Giant is not working there can be various reasons why that is happening sometimes because they are lying and pinpointing that is key.Thanks for the post OP.,CODZombies,d11txyi,3,t5_2sal9

6962568,0,t3_4b11yf,You want a good campaign? Play WaW.You want to have fun in zombies? Play Black Ops .You want quality multiplayer? Dont play Call of Duty.The problem with a franchise like CoD is that its no longer developed as a game but as a source of income. Been that way since MWBO. They dont care if the game is fun or any good they dont care if the community likes it it simply sells. As long as they can keep shitting out a recycled game every year knowing full well itll sell millions why would they bother changing anything? Just make the same game call it something else add microtransactions that dont even affect gameplay at all and there you go. The frightening amount of people who actually spend money on these is the proof that we are the ones who need to change.So yeah if anything we as a community are the ones to blame why would they change their ways if the worst we do is complain every now and then? We buy their shit they wont change their ways as long as we do so. Besides what is there to really change after nearly a decade? Theres only so much you can come up with especially on such a terribly outdated engine further restricted by the fact it has to run on consoles. Im not taking their defense some of the shit they do is flat out inexcusable but CoD as a franchise should have died with MW theyre actually doing a pretty decent job at coming up with a few things that feel somewhat fresh.By the way you really need to edit the OP.

Since it only effects the last zombie of the round and all the other zombies would be dead by then id say its not op. Maybe reducing it down to  minutes but not more because then id be useless. In Place is like a pause button for multiplayer games. You get one pop it if you need to go do something and then just chill for  minutes doing whatever.And yes my intent with Private Eyes is to raise awareness for it. I do hope DLC brings it back!

Keep rolling the box between rounds until you have the gorgon and the drakon. PAP them both but dont repack them. Use the gorgon until about round  then the drakon as long as you can. You want to aim to get to  before you start running trains. My strat was to buy the kn and the vesper easy ammo access and repack them for blast furnace and dead wire. Then I just ran I tight circle next to the power switch hitting the trap as often as I could. Dont destroy your whole train at once try to space it out a little so you will have gaps to run though when the zombies spawn and try to get staminup as it makes the whole process ten times easier.

I saw one big post on this sub trying to explain it as the physical manifestation of the Aether on the worldy plane but that didnt make sense because the I thought the Vrilgenerator the Golden Rod and other thing its connected to or maybe the Golden Rod is the connection of the two things just allows people on the worldy plane to tap into the Aether and its energy which Sam was connected to through the MPD in BO and Richtofen gained access to by soulswitching with Sam at the end of Moon. Ive asked this question before on this sub with regards to how Sam ended up in Agartha in BO when she should be on the Moon in Richtofens body and thought I understood but it seems like every time I think I have a good enough grasp of the storyline something else comes in and adds new layers.,CODZombies,d27zqch,1,t5_2sal9

7322552,0,t3_4foaxp,To each there own but at a certain point it becomes about how much time you want to sink into a game rather than raw skill. Sure  rounds looks impressive and great on a leaderboard but how many hours did that take? Id say once you get to or past  or so youd be good to go until you get bored. Back when WaW was out I could sink  hours into a game single enjoying  and working part time at a pizza shack. Id get to round  on Shino Numa and be fine but nowadays I work  hours a week have a home and all that comes with that as well as a wife and pets so I cant afford to spend that much time on the game. Im lucky if I get to play one good free night of Zombies every couple weeks maybe an hour or two on the weekends but thats about it.,CODZombies,d2aived,3,t5_2sal9

7331467,0,t3_4fn2vb,Okay so I do have some questions about the plants. If I water it with blue water once and then leave it alone for the next two rounds what happens? Will it act like I didnt water it at all or give me a plant? Then the next one is does the order matter? People say to get the fruit you have to do purple green and then blue. Do you just have to use all three colors or do they have to be in that specific order? So then if I use something like  blues and one green is it just random whether it gives me a blue or green plant? Also you can upgrade the plants by shooting them with the KT when watering them. I believe the imprint plant is obtained by upgrading a plant and its just random. I was trying to get the AA Shell last night and used the blue water with the KT. One turned into the purple reward plant with spores that gave me the shell. I had two others turn into the imprint plant. ,CODZombies,d2bjd6e,1,t5_2sal9

7391470,0,t3_4gjly7,The thing is not all of us are good players or even aspire to be so. I started playing black ops  zombies as a way to kinda hang and socialize with my uncle who lives quite far away. We started off really not knowing much about eachother to having a fantastic bond which also helped me to understand aspects of my family that I never knew. It because a Saturday night ritual along with another close friend and my brother in law. Now the crutch you mentioned comes in. Three of us are passable players but my uncle just sucks. No amount of hours invested has made him better. Due to my uncles crippling lack of skill everyone having the bow was awesome. Especially with the lack of easy mode that was present in bops. With one ww our options are now give him the op gun and watch him live a little longer than he would but ultimately watching him go down with it or huddling him up in a corner and protecting him. We got a taste of everyone gets the strong participation trophy and liked it. If the game would introduce difficulty levels again then its not much of an issue. Were an average round  crew. It would be nice to be able to do Easter eggs and such while allowing him to feel included and capable. While that may not be happening its a load more fun that we can all feel immortal for a few rounds. So while you represent the upper tier who wants more difficulty and hates the boost things like bows for everyone gives theres a very real lower tier who never gets to see all of the content and miss our easy mode. TLDR Were gimps and need the crutch to walk. ,CODZombies,d2icz40,4,t5_2sal9

7447478,0,t3_4haonf,I had this challenge when I was doing an easter egg run. Took me  rounds to finish but what I did was I got the HG  not papd and I trained close to spores. Id run my train into the spore and more often than not  zombie would transform. Id just shoot them all with my HG in the head thinning them out and hurrying to finish off the transforming zombie.After  spores I got them all. Its trial and error for the most part. Id say it helps to have Blast Furnace ready to go off in hopes it chains to the transforming zombie. The easiest gun for doing this is also probably the Marshals or the Haymaker. ,CODZombies,d2oqbut,2,t5_2sal9

I was referring to the sprints in between getting your skull completing it going to put it back and then getting another skull... rinse and repeat. Could have been handled better if they let you pick up all  skulls at once. Watering plants and the challenges are very important. If you choose not to do them you cant upgrade the WW or do the easter egg. Again it could have been handled better if they made it so that you just had to water a plant once then wait  rounds rather than take trips back and forth filling up your bucket in the early game.Little things like these would go far in adding to the maps replay value without having to change anything about the map.

7747255,0,t3_4le9ca,Der Reise gt Der Eisendrache gt AscensionIdk what it is about these primarily  maps that I enjoy so much but Der Reise is my favorite because of nostalgia and simplicity.  Pack a Punch is first introduced along with areas both for camping and training.I loved the bows in Der Eisendrache.  Ascension because of the space theme.  It was also one of the first maps to introduce a true completable Easter egg.  Sure the reward was kinda crappy but it was definitely fun getting there.I really dont think there are any maps I really dislike.  Anyone that says they dislike a map needs to consider what the map was meant for and the time the map was created.  People who say natch sucks need to realize that it was a barebones map that started off the entire nazi zombies rampage.TLDR I like Der Reise for nostalgia and stuff Eisendrache for the actual map and scenery and Ascension because nostalgia.  I dont think there is really a bad nazi zombies map.,CODZombies,d3mt1dp,2,t5_2sal9

You never really needed to stop progressing the rounds to do anything like buildables watering plants building a bowstaff doing convoluted things to get all the perks getting upgrading online etc. But the difficulty didnt plateau at round  it kept getting harder but it also didnt ramp up super steep from round  like Treyarch zombies does which is nice to keep those early game downs to a minimum.Infection kinda fell on its face with the not really harsh but time wasting penalty for not rescuing a civilian and the blanket infection gas forcing your into the sewers.But the best thing I would say came from that mode was losing perks slowly as you bled out it gave your teammates a reason to prioritize revives and kept the so called poverty cycle off players who are more prone to getting downed.

The Apothicons would start trying to possess nikolais unconscious self who we failed to collect from Stalingrad. Once you make your way throug the Easter egg you have to summon all Apothicons in existence and turn them into humans which you need to cleanse and kill so that their souls ascend into the MPD causing whoever is in control of the zombies to lose control of the zombies and then the keepers take control and every zombie left is a keeper.,CODZombies,d3zzsn7,2,t5_2sal9

That and the nonlinear style of movement in zombies using a thumbstick instead of moving point to point would lead to some motion sickness unless a omnidirectional treadmill was used instead. The tech required would be quite a ways too much for most home users but its one of those things that an arcade could pull off if they put their mind to it.,CODZombies,d4jy34h,1,t5_2sal9

Never played BO only waw and BO and then i quit gaming for like five years.one thing ive quickly realized is the game has gotten way easier  the level design  the way zombies spawn is a power combo of difficulty.one thing ive enjoyed about the old game is the guns.  It seems like the available guns are more varied and fun to play with than on BO.  for me.. the vesper or the VMP or kuda.. they are all decent guns. all kinda do the same job.  i feel like the weapons are all too tightly coupled with a type of gun that they end up feeling very similar.,CODZombies,d4k5e56,1,t5_2sal9

8067525,0,t1_d4muxtj,I do not think it is the easiest map ever. I feel that Shi No Numa the WaW version is the easiest map ever. I NEVER use the buildables in this map unless it is the Trample Steam which I use to go over to the Courthouse free to get Speed Cola and put the chalk drawing. Other than that no buildables at all I use in Buried. You DO NOT have to use the bank you know. Yeah of course there are those people that say yay I got to round  on Buried but in reality should not be proud because its Buried at the end of the day. I also never use the Time Bomb or Paralyzer  I hate these things. I could safely say that other than the Jet Gun the Paralyzer is my least favourite wonder weapon even less favourable than the VR. On Buried to just sit there in a camping spot you need to have a lot of stuff done have the Paralyzer have the Subsurface Resonator have the Turbine. However in Shi No Numa WaW not BO all you need is Juggernog and the Wunderwaffe BOOM easier than Buried. And remember that I still much prefer Der Riese and Mob of the Dead over Buried. Anyways your opinion Im not going to argue any further.,CODZombies,d4mv6uy,1,t5_2sal9

8080933,0,t1_d4ocyqt,I like the newer maps because theyre much more satisfying because of all the stuff you have at your disposal to survive. Maps like Kino bore me to death nowadays because after you get perks and pack a punch thats it. By round  Im set up and its just monotonous round grinding. In BO and BO its usually around round  before it gets to that point which I vastly prefer. And moreover the perceived lack of difficulty is kind of a bias created by all the above average players on this sub. Normal run of the mill zombies players are still quite challenged by the newer maps. Sure I might be able to get to round  on The Giant easily but Im probably part of only about  of overall zombies players who can do that. Theyre catering to everyone instead of just the  which is very smart.,CODZombies,d4odehb,5,t5_2sal9

8137038,0,t3_4qon16,Im  not the best player ever but here are some tips I use. SoE Use the train to get around instead of opening each door when you start off saves some points.The Giant  Open up power then just camp by power with a few weapons for awhile then go to cat walk. Eventually youll want to circle around the map with the Wunderwaff and use traps.DE  Get the storm bow and circle around upper courtyard or camp in clock tower with the storm bow.ZNS  Honestly I dont know. If you do the Easter egg and camp in the elevator with the WW its amazing but I dont really have any tips besides that. Hope this helps!,CODZombies,d4uoe19,2,t5_2sal9

More than half the steps can be done before round  solo if you get lucky with a few double points no nukes and easy challenges. DE is a much easier easter egg on solo than MP. I recommend doing ZnS first boss fight is easier and overall less complicated than the DE one.

Way easier then previous zombies you get an extra hit from zombies you have AA you have cache back GG AAT makes guns always effective so having WW ammo isnt even necessary now.  Thats why  isnt even really impressive anymore its not till you hit  that people are like okay you got skill now.  Prime example anyone can sit in teleporter or clock tower on DE with a lightening bow and with one pop shocks GG kill the panzer  times and make it to   without even really having to move or play tbh.

8341433,0,t3_4tt2rv,Since Treyarch have been making the models of the original  over the dlcs it could be a tad bit easier for them to make maps containing those characters as for resurrection . I feel like theyre going to recreateremaster two maps instead of  such as Moon and Origins to be able to produce next gen quality remasters. I feel like a wet towel so sorry for that but the Easter eggs in maps are indepth and requires a large amount of steps which could alter how they remaster maps.If there was a  map remaster the replayability would last enough for the next treyarch cod it would be awesome and I hope its a thing.

Also DE still being a good map is just way too easy once you know the bow steps just get lightning and well done your off to a  game that and panzers were kinda annoying. GK has nothing too annoying in terms of boss type zombies the manglers arent that big of a deal and even the dragons breathign fire on the map isnt that bad.

8429862,0,t3_4v3u8x,The ZnS cipher reminds me so much of the Shino radio transmission. Just thought Id point that out. Also if anything itll be the German Riese Robots since they had to of stolen the schematics and then upgraded the robots with the face lasers. Also something I found interesting was that the Riese Robot featured in The Giant had the same laser as the Gigant Robots in Gorod Krovi. Im aware that the universes are separate but I just found it interesting and maybe the Gorod Krovi and The Giant universes are bleeding together.,CODZombies,d5v9v4i,1,t5_2sal9

8436053,0,t1_d5vm6p8, upgrade paths for Wonder Weapon Free gumballs Plunger melee plus upgrade Ragnarok BuildableBox Wonder Weapon Trials Gauntlet Quest Time Trials Dragon Strike and Shield upgrades.Again I should rephrase i think the things to do in DE are more fun and less tedious except the Void Bow sorry Voidbowaintthatbad.The gauntlet is okay to get but at low rounds gets a bit tedious as you sitting around waiting for a dragon waiting a round so it will cool down waiting for another dragon to come around so you can bring your zombies into it to get napalm kills hoping for a instakill or switching to a sniper or shotgun for penetrating kills get the melee kills with one burst from shield a not tedious step going over to hatchery to complete your second or third lockdown and then waiting another full round for the dragon egg to cool off again. Finally now you have the gauntlet at an early round but it doesnt feel good it felt like something really out of the way and annoying. The Dragon strike and Shield are okay upgrade paths and the time trials and normal trials Except the bad one Fuck the MG arent bad either but really dislike as I said the Gauntlet How the Groph Modules dont keep the Round and the fact that during the Easter egg you have to do a total of  lock downs.,CODZombies,d5w1ob5,1,t5_2sal9

8528654,0,t3_4wk7ls,If the staffs are very different to the origins ones then I would be ok with them. I would be very disappointed if all we got was an AS upgrade.I actually like the  elemental staffs and bows because it means everyone can get a WW. The problem on DE is that not all bows are equally powerful. The storm bow is easily better than any other one and is very easy to get which has led to people calling the storm bow in public games. If they bring back a similar idea all  elemental weapons need to either be equally powerful and therefore equally difficulteasy to obtain. OR have some be more powerful than others but have the best ones be harder to get. ,CODZombies,d67n8qh,12,t5_2sal9

One of the spiders will glow red when mesmerized and will drink the green  blue and purple water when you lead him near it. Then have him go in the cage under A. Then go to the panel and shock it with your shield. Complete two rounds then go recall the cage you can pickup spiderbait which will let you be a spider.

If youre on the cdz sub youre probably not a casual gamer so why are you playing on a console? Stepping up to PC is perfect if youre a hardcore gamer yet  of people stay on the platform that doesnt suit them. If you play games all day every day and you want the best experience PC is hands down the best. If you just want to casually play every now and then a console is better.

8683640,0,t3_4yx0wi,The only definitive evidence we have is that we got a gateworm from The Giant. the only way to acquire these gateworms is to collect a soul. We dont kill anyone else in that map and the easter egg only involves us letting Maxis know where and when we are beacon is lit so he can teleport us to the other universes to get the other souls. I read a theory awhile back that the reason the Key didnt glow yellow in the cutscene is because it ran out of power when used in Shadows. We used it to collect four souls as well as to summon the squid demon kill the shadowman and summon the giant gateworm. It only had enough juice for one more soul before needing a recharge. Richtofen states that we must cleanse the Keeper in DE and then we can recharge the Key. After beating the Keeper he says we need to use the Key to override the electric field on Dempsey but it needs a little more juice. We then insert it in the MPD to recharge it. I definitely think we collected Richtofens soul in TG but it didnt go up into the portal either because Eddie is already in the house or Richtofen is holding out on something.,CODZombies,d6r2wro,2,t5_2sal9

8715025,0,t1_d6uw7kf,Thats fair man. I definitely understand the appeal behind the simplicity of the old days. Not much compares to the feeling of spinning the Ray Gun in the box on Kino all those years ago...There were times before Gorod Krovi where I managed to convince myself that I wanted a box wonder weapon. Then the MK happened and I was reminded that I hate weapons being hidden behind nothing but RNG. I feel accomplished every time I build the KT and upgrade it to the Masamune as long of a process as that is. I would literally rather do that every game than know that I could end up on round  without the WW because the box is being awful. But Im glad they have maps where thats how its done so everybody gets a little of what they want.I do have to completely disagree about knifing in BO. Its absolutely amazing in BO and only gets worse as you go back further. I can safely knife my way to round  every game meaning I dont have to worry about a gun and I get massive points. I can then grab the Bowie Knife and keep knifing until the teens. Not only that but its insanely fun  the Bowie Knife is my mostused weapon in BO with k kills. Then I switch back to BO and remember that on round freaking two youre risking death by trying to knife a zombie without Jug. Dont even get me started on BO knifing.The trick is to make sure that you get close to a zombie then start backing up before you hit the melee button. If youre already walking backwards before you knife youll literally never do the lunge. The knife also has amazing range in BO compared to past games you can actually stay out of a zombies range and continue knifing him to death without being hit in BO this is extremely hard to do in past games.Also I never knife zombies behind barriers they cant drop powerups ,CODZombies,d6v0ld0,1,t5_2sal9

If you want a quick summary... This wil be VERY VERY VERY rough and I recommend looking around like mrroflwaffles and johnnyjRichtoffen was told to get the kronorium which would show him where the summoning key is. In the end cutscene he comes into the map and steals the summoning key. He is then needed to require souls before being able to use it. So in the giant which is debated whether this did happen or not richtoffen takes his .s soul for a universe there are multiple universes in Der eisen they require dempseys . soul zns is takeos . soul and gorod krovi nikolais . soul is taken. In the end richtoffen brings the souls to agartha and were now told to go to the house.

That map that most of the community agrees is one of the best maps of all time. As a grand finale of Black Ops  Zombies. Zetsubou no Shima is arguably the worst map Blundell has made and thats mainly because of how often the map is broken from glitches Golden Bucket Final Boss etc. Gorod was amazing but MK could be buffed Shadows has gone from meh to great and DE was always the fun quick game map.

8738171,0,t1_d6xvs8x,gtWhile its most likely that the souls we are collecting in Bo are not from the characters we play as in WaW they are defiantly all in the same universe. If der Eisendrache is a separate universe then why would we teleport away from griffin castle and then travel there on the origins robot why not just teleport to the castle right away. Same with zetasabou. Why stowaway on someones ship when we could just teleport to the island straight off. The only place we are seen teleporting to is GK and it doesnt make any sense for us to get two of the souls in one universe and then get nikolais in a completely different universe. if thats not enough proof in the Giant when you pack a punch each of the characters say something along the lines of maybe this can help me activate the beacon so I can get the hell out of here. This shows that we activated the beacon for maxis so he could tell us how to escape the giant and get to griffin castle with the origins robot as seen in the Der Eisendrache introMaxis teleported them to each map.Useing the machine that they destroyed in the Revelations Intro .Dempsey Basically answered your question in ZNS.gtDempsey Hey Richtofen why dont you tell your pal Maxis to drop us off exactly where we need to be next time?gtRichtofen We are dealing with the complexities of the interdimensional time travel across a fracturing universe! Its not exactly easy... Keep a close watch on Takeo. We need him alive before we... we uh...There was a cipher where maxis said that we had to kill and collect each soul in each particular universe. It is established that Each soul collected was in a different universe there is no arguing that.gtthe origins universe has existed the whole time along with some other universes.  No Where is this established. Monty clearly says that the fracturing of the main universe caused multiple.gtHowever the events that happen on the origins map couldnt have happend until Samantha was sent to argatha at the end of the buried EE. IIt is never established WaW samantha  Origins Samantha. Thats a theory Which results in a paradox. But WaW is a result of the Fracturing universe as said by monty in the wisps in GK. See this as I actually posted this theory a while ago gtn origins maxis broke the barrier between argatha and the real world so he could save Samantha this created a infinite amount of Universes that are identical to each other There was only one universe before. Monty said that this original universe fractured and that caused multiverse.gtand the apothicans that were trapped in argatha have now infested multiple different universes such as SOE MOTD and many of the parallel universes. Just like Monty saidApothicons trapped in Argatha? Where is this established. It seems to me you are basing this more on your theories and not facts. gtThe reason People call WaWBo the original universe is because WaWBo had to happen in order for the events of origins to take place the multiple identlical universes to take form and the apothican invasion to begin. So while there may have been other universes around during that time The reason why people belive its original is because of Nostalgia and they cant get over the fact that it doesnt matter. Again Where is it established that origins cant take place without WaW? Its not. gtWaWBo is definitely the most importantLOL. Nope  I guarantee you its not at all. Blundell basically erased that universe with the BO timeline. Bo is the most important which includes Origins and Motd.,CODZombies,d6xx5rr,2,t5_2sal9

If however they are constructs of the .s data and the .s are plugged into the Matrix as . avatars who found the server with their original data. That explains Monty saying you shouldnt be here.

8767870,0,t3_506v3q, It seems like the straightforward answer is the right answer and the crew simply werent standing right next to Maxis when the Shadow Man was calling out to him. I mean these men have literally been to hell and back fighting for their lives and the lives of the children and so much more. I think a little RampR was well deserved. Monty told Richtofen where the Kronorium a book  with lots of knowledge in it was and from there Richtofen went to search for the summoning key. It would seem that Monty knows a lot but not everything. He only knew where to find the information that was needed so he sent Richtofen on his way and then seemingly turned away until Gorod Krovi. I am actually discussing this right now in this thread The easiest answer is that Monty just sorta built him a body. The rules that govern Monty and the extent of his powers are still very unclear. But he either built him a new body or found one for him. there is no evidence that he spent any time with them during this gap. There is actually quotes of character asking where he has been if I remember correctly. They were just showing the past maps along with Takeos words. MotD just happened to be there because it is a fan service within the trailer. The same can be said for Nacht as our crew was never there except for Dempsey. I might be the only one that thinks this but I believe Richtofen sent his own soul to the house as soon as he could in case they failed to secure the other souls. That way no matter what happened his soul would be safe in the house. A little selfish but understandable especially for Richtofens character.All of these are theories opinions and most likely explanations. They are the best that I can think of and may be wrong but at least they seem to make sense for now.,CODZombies,d71nbcl,2,t5_2sal9
8768151,0,t1_d71n98w,Lol I realized that like  seconds after I hit send then I got in the car. Dont text and drive!My thoughts on the Rezzurection maps they arent Black Ops  maps. Theyre WaW maps ported directly into Black Ops . Kino was a WaW map but got pushed back and put into BO. The Giant however I see as a Black Ops  maps because they remade the shit out of that map.

8775777,0,t1_d72mb56,I think that by the end of the game it should be absolutely clear what the twist or point of the story was. BO failed so hard in that regard. When my character said Taylor at the end it made no sense to me. There wasnt a holy shit! moment or anything. I just went and googled what that was even supposed to mean while the credits rolled in the background. And then to find out that the main punchline of the story was hidden away in some fast scrolling text that you would have to go out of your way to read! It was just too ambiguous. BO nailed the aspect of the mindfuck with Reznov and we didnt have to go out of our way to figure it out.,CODZombies,d72n1es,2,t5_2sal9

8838861,0,t1_d7a6ufl,.....I dont see how something like the MBWF moving makes the game more fun. Well IMO youre probably one of the only people who think this. Its not like youll be spinning the box every round to round .. You normally spin it to get something specific not off a wallbuy amp then youre done with it since high rounds its easier to use a wallgun due to ammo repurchases.If someone is going for Widows Wine on DE and it moves like its meant too the WF then its a fucking joke since it can take me up to  attempts to get it sometimes. As for Electric Cherry that isnt even rare for me... I always get that same with Deadshot.

After pack and punch we started hearing a bleep on certain very specific parts of the map. The controller started to vibrate and once we saw a casket with some sand in it within the eisendrache zone we hold square. A small gateworm came out and turned into one of the void bow step symbols. It coloured the equipment slabs on the right in a yellow slab icon. A purple one. And I believe a blue one. They were in different spots. Same story on all three.

8854387,0,t3_51g44i,In the Mob of the Dead area of Revelations you can find  radios which tell the story of someone retelling the story of the Mob of the Dead crew with some big changes to how we remember it. At the end you hear that he is heading to the Waterfront district meaning that this is taking place in the Shadows of Evil city further strengthening the ties between MOTD and SoE. The Shadowman is also hinted at. You can find my transcripts below.HD Recording of all  radios TRANSCRIPTSRadio So I just sat down with Stanley Ferguson night guard at Alcatraz he told me a heck of a tale a few years back four inmates  mobsters and some weasel had this brilliant plan to escape the rock. I know they sound like real geniuses these guys. Anyway this weasel was quite the talker he had these guys convinced they could escape. He told them he could build a plane and together theyd all fly right off the rock!Radio Now the weasel had plans and drawings and everything I saw them but even if they built it no way that baby would ever fly. These mobsters theyre lost on me. Theyre smart guys I mean Sal De Luca! I mean no way you can convince a man of his calibre of something so absurd. So I guess at some point the whole sorry truth came out and the weasel found himself cornered they did him good. Left him bleeding to death on the cold stone roof. They all got the chair for it and that was that. Sad to think that  guys like that could find themselves swindled all because they bought into the lies of a delusional conman.Radio Anyway no clue why Mr Raf? wanted me to meet this Stanley first but Im headed into the city now. Something about tracking down  doozies and a floozy. Oh yeah not to mention those artefacts in the South Pacific in Russia I dont know what thats about. I never even met this guy like to stay in the Shadows real weirdo.

8854818,0,t1_d7c7nw6,gtHow are assets placed in specific spots not working properly indications of it being finished?Because this is how the engine works. The engine renders the map over entities. gtI hope these type of issues dont get fixed so you can be proven right there.They wont be cos its how the engine works buddy.gtIt isnt an issue on PC because the maps are patched a good bit to fix errors such as these before it even releases on PC. No its not an issue Note that gorod krovi has the same issue on xbox. cos a PC can render everything without using the method that consoles use.gtIf it gets fixed it is not an issue with the system but instead with the game.What? Its an issue with the consoles not being able to render everything at the same time this is how they made it so the consoles can stick at a stable FPS.gtIt isnt Treyarchs fault they just created the system for the game and allowed it to screw over fans because they clearly HAD to...Mother fucker youre entitled. They didnt have to give you shit. They could make the gobblegum system only cost money and its nothing wrong with it. They cut out a system they didnt want to use. You dont deserve shit youre not owed shit. Stop being so fucking entitled. gtActivision can tell them what to do but they just have to stand up for themselvesYoure fucking kidding me right? This isnt a friendly haha treyarch do this kind of relationship. This is a Listen to me do this shit or we start firing people. Cos activision will do that and they wont bat a fucking eye while doing it. gtEven the rewards we got like with the contract addition could give players items they already have with little to no reward for trading them in.Entitled as fuck once again.gtWhere are simple systems to reward players who get duplicates?They dont have to exist at all!gtThe liquid divinium system is not nearly as bad but still a scamNo its not? Its fully fucking legal. Maybe you should learn what scam means. gtbut whatever gambling for virtual items with no monetary value even when being ripped off is currently a thing in the industry and some people are blindsided enough by their own stupidity to defend such business practices so whatever it is not like talking about such will help. It actually isnt something thats ignored. Look at CSGO people are calling that shit out on the fucking daily. gtJust might as well accept it...I wont but you and others can do as you please.Yes cos ive totally said I agree with it. I just dont think that the issue is as much of an issue as you think in this game at all.gtStop making shitposts when you cant even understand the issues at handTheres literally no fucking issue at hand.gtGet back to me when you can do something as simple as reading to understand someones comment like I did for you You fucking sure buddy?gtOhh savage...oh wait no that is not even savage it is all just fucking truths.Youre literally being such a fucking idiot. Now lets talk about this  year shit. You said and I quote gt year long story and we cant even get items in fixed locations to stop glitching in and out of reality when its clearly not part of the story as well as it could fit in lol.So  years on a story yet they cant get there engine working?

Its more likely that the ragnaroks have caused some sort of bug due to them not taking up a weapon grenade or melee slot. A specialist weapon has never been in the box before and this is likely your issue.

8883951,0,t1_d7fo7d2,Idk I highly doubt it but its still possible. But the cycle imo probably means that the original storyline will be setup. Meaning it will complete the cycle from original  to origins  back to original . Meaning something will most likely go wrong and they will fail and the whole entire original story will still be intact and keep happening over and over again. The other one was a better tomorrow so maybe its either an alt ending EE or its the secondfirst Easter egg similar to moon. I could see the cycle being setup up after a first one but then a last second save by the crew to break the cycle at the end. I could see treyarch doing that,CODZombies,d7fq4dq,1,t5_2sal9

What happened to Peter and why he was shown in the trailer and in GK if only to disappear just a tiny easter egg?.Who the hell Dr. Monty is.What the ending exactly meant are our O the Primis characters now and its all a cycle? Or did Monty wipe them from existence?.What happened to the children.Why they have blood vials with MOTD prisoner numbers on them whose blood is it? Why does the blood protect them?.Why we see Richtofen scream Maxis name in the trailer.Why we see the Shadowman supposedly shock Richtofen.Why the pillars in the trailer are blue rather than red.Why Dr. Monty is on the Apoth. side of the Kino stage.What the frozen forest is.What the scene with Monty and the Apoth. creature in the trailer is all about.Why Richtofen is shown getting shocked in the trailer.Why Richtofen says Mein Gott what have I done?.Lots of other stuff.Most of all we need answers to so many other stories. There were some stories that have been wrapped up whilst many others remain open.This isnt the end. Theres more to the story of course. So much more. The whole story is a cycle. From Origins on and even from the Original  and on. Our characters travel the universe to kill their . selves. They arrive at the House and defeat the Shadowman. Monty sends them back in time and they become Primis and win the war. And then time goes on until they are reborn and meet again in Origins. Monty knew this plan all along and he has probably been sending them in the same cycle forever. We broke the cycle in Mob of the Dead.Now we have to break the cycle again.Monty must be stopped to free our characters from this paradox.,CODZombies,d7oapsc,13,t5_2sal9

9014768,0,t3_53qn9j,My biggest fear prior to launch was that  or more of Revelations would be recycled maps and little to no new original playable areas. I had high hopes that theyd make a massive map with lots of new areas along with the old ones but that never happened. On top of the map being mainly other maps reuses they also gave us DGs again and AS. Im fine with both of these weapons but it felt more like they were an excuse instead of making a new specialist weapon and WW. It just seems so freaking weird to me that there are NO buildable original weapons in the final map and there are no new special weapons in the map why couldnt they at least give us  specialist weapons from BO to pick from? It just doesnt feel special. Maybe they have some big surprise for us when PC and Xbox gets the map sigh but if not Im very very disappointed in the amount of reused playable areas and weapons. Would it really have been that hard to toss in  old weapons from the past games at the very least? This is the final map right??? The one that is supposed to tie everything together and be the grand finale... WtfIts funny because they definitely knew a huge majority of the community wanted the staves back if a WW had to be recycled. Yet they do something completely different.

Otherwise you can just run into the front of him and hell start chasing you again. However you can bump him on all  other sides and he wont come after you.

So basically you have to shoot the perk covered with ice in two locations. If you shoot the top and you hear glass breaks so deadshot is there. If you shoot the middle and hear the glass breaks it is stamin up,CODZombies,d84n3ys,3,t5_2sal9

9094194,0,t1_d84xc0t,I dont think theres any debate at all about which is better fro m a technical standpoint or price or anything but its mainly about preference of experience. I like console more because even though it can be a lot better i despise playing with keyboard and mouse and I like being able to lay back on a sofa with a controller and a big TV screen. Plus in my experience with PC you can rarely play with friends without one guy taking forever due to technical problems. I feel like console is worth the extra money for things like online just because of how streamlined console is plus I like having everyone the exact same hardware with only small differences i.e. scuf controllers whereas on PC if you have a  laptop and youre playing a guy with a  gaming PC he custom built youre at a disadvantage.,CODZombies,d84z5n4,14,t5_2sal9

9183590,0,t3_55upec,Ok some of this info is used from other posts one I know of is called why zombies have red eyes ok lets begin so back in mob of the dead we saw that our characters were in hell or purgatory and the announcer sounded like Satan himself well in revalations we get a shadow man quote that says that dr Monty is Satan lucifer and the devil also to note in MOTD zombies eyes are red in gorod krovi the zombies eyes first turn red now in every other map its been orange why a change? Well first of all the origins crew went to MOTD after ZNS and got the blood as confirmed in a quote in revalations so something must have followed them out in gorod krovi we finally get wisps from dr Monty and in some of them it seems like he is trying to get the crew against Richthofen because Monty knows Richthofen can destroy his plan for a loop but isnt sure and at this point we arent sure who to trust Monty or shadow man you see they used to be friends but he never says how they were friends what if Monty was an apothicon or some creature as we see from the kino stage in revelations he could be and shadow man rose above him and Monty was banned to hell that would explain why he has use for the crew to kill shadow man he also doesnt seem like a god or an all powerful one so maybe an apothicon also in MOTD there are lion references and as you know Jason blundell has planned BO since MOTD also there werent supposed to be zombies in stalingrad so Monty had something to do with it please point out anything I missed and if you find a loop hole please notify me by posting a comment,CODZombies,d8g35wm,1,t5_2sal9

I have been trying to find one shred of evidence other than a tweet that the cutscene was from Shadows... people throw around the word confirmed constantly here that it has lost any meaning but people still take it as gospel.For now there is still things we have missed in old maps... and regardless if there is a cutscene or not people still to keep hope that there are more answers out there right now.Edit I havent really programmed anything in years... but one major red flag is that there is no reason to be calling that SoE cutscene and you can see it so plainly.

Or Nice he got all of his perks on round  due to a gumball and now has an easy ticket through the game.The funniest thing is you see people with all perks masks and shield go down during low rounds. Nowadays I just play BO occasionally to troll people. I cannot take such a game seriously.I am level  master prestige all EEs complete all challengescalling cards complete all PS trophies complete etc. High rounds are  on Rev  on Shadows  on Der Eisen  on Zetsubou  on Gorod Krovi and  on Giant.

This will account for the concept that the origins crew looks like PRIMIS because they ARE PRIMIS but that doesnt happen to the new universes origins crew until the events of revelation in that new universe.

10292132,0,t3_5ndl4f,I actually decided to use the zombies in the other three traps just so they werent wasted I didnt want to be still crafting the xquisite on round ... but I killed a few with my gun and the UFO actually did collect souls. So I decided to kill about  per UFO then once the brute broke the teeth etc... I would come back and only have to kill a couple more to get the element... came back to Journey and couldnt find the UFO... turns out it left the element on the ground and had to have been there for  rounds or so before I picked it up. So I can confirm that even though I had an element in my arcane core the UFO collected souls AND dropped a new element... and it seems like it might stay on the ground indefinitely until you pick it up. Also seems like a new UFO wont spawn around that trap again until you pick up the element since I couldnt find one anywhere after  rounds and usually almost immediately after I get my element I hear another UFO around the trap. ,CODZombies,dcao3aj,2,t5_2sal9

10682242,0,t3_5st5qv,The issue for me with zombies is that theyre all going down the same route and making their gamemode roundwave based. Treyarch should have kept that mechanic for themselves and the other studios could have tried to do something else but with zombie A.I.Playing for rounds or side quests every  month on a new map becomes very stale very quickly. You can say play something else but I love playing zombies because the core mechanics are like nothing else out there but it would have been nice to see zombies in a different type of gamemode rather than in another infinite round mode. I legitimately love to see these bigger Youtubers complain because maybe it will encourage the developers to try and be adventurous. If they dont then people will continue to tire of it. I played since WaW and I barely touch zombies these days despite owning every map released to date including ExoZombies and IW Zombies.,CODZombies,ddhsjc2,1,t5_2sal9

I get that it was a hypothetical question but I was responding to you not the OP.Hypothetically speaking remastered maps would be an amazing addition but realistically I would prefer to see new gamemodes added rather than remastered maps. You can make a map look better but its still the same map regardless of gumballs or new weapons. Gamemodes would add something more unique like a zombie gungame similar to the UGXMod gungame mode. That would be a great alternative to the infinite round mode and would be hugely popular in my opinion.,CODZombies,ddx39xj,1,t5_2sal9

Ive made it fairly far along in the process already after just a handfull of attempts despite not knowing the map all that well yet. Spaceland took me forever and a half to complete Simon Says and Seticom were brutal.I will say I was a bit shocked at how much smaller and more segmented RitR feels though it takes a much different mindset IMO to stay alive in it than ZiS. I guess the best way to put it from my perspective is that ZiS EE was way harder but staying alive in general is way harder on RitR.

The hacker was interesting the wave gun was great having that amazing dome area and yes the gravity and o masks that were required were very controvercial but overall this map holds some of my most greatest times playing zombies. lt lt lt PS. Am I over appreciating this time period or was BO phenomenal for public matchmaking? Just curious. ,CODZombies,deowml5,2,t5_2sal9

There is a poster in black ops  zombies that says Faust on it I think and has a devil on it. That devil looks very similar to the one you see in iw zombies when you earn tickets and I think hes in the maps somewhere as well. Those are the only two examples I can think of right now since I havent played in a while.I realize this seems petty but these little things along with the core mechanics being rehashed just made iw zombies feel like a crappy offbrand TO ME.

11171284,0,t3_5zhxex,A few thingsYoure running an ik which is a Kabylake CPU and is running the Intel  chipset. The Motherboard you picked is H which means its on the  chipset Skylake ex. ik so the CPU wont work on that mother board without a Bios update and the only way to update it is by booting into your bios with a Skylake CPU installed updating the Bios then replace the Skylake with your ik. Super simple to do its just you need a last generation CPU to do that. If you want to keep the same CPU then youll need a chipset board B Z basically anything with a  in itIf you want the same Motherboard then youll need a Skylake CPU i or kAlso you chose an iK and if you dont know the K version means theyre overclockable but they only way to Overclock is by using a Z board ZZ Suggestion if you want to keep the K model so you can overlock get a Z board. If you dont want to overclock get the i and a B board. Other things May want to bump up the PSU to atleast w minimum. Sound cards arent necessary at all unless youre a super super audiophile but at that point youd get a sound board. Audio from the motherboard is perfect nowadays. Windows  or any version of Windows can be gotten online for way cheaper  if you wouldnt mind going that route. Ive bought windows codes for cheap for all my computers and theyve all been fine. EDIT  Highly highly recommend an SSD even just a gb. The boot time will be amazing and way way faster than an HDD Also is a DVD drive necessary for your build?

Its a way to hide an upgrade step without the answer being in the code. Theres very obviously two sets of apothicon servant parts under the map. Thats not a glitch. It can obviously be upgraded on that map. We found it THROUGH a glitch but the upgrade was something they programmed in. We just have to find the egg so they program in the trigger.

One of the biggest differences between bo and every other zombies game is that there are reaaalllyyyyyy few bad weapons in bo. And the chances of you getting a bad weapon in the box in bo is astronomical.Old games...lol you could always play spot the noob based on of they grabbed a wall weapon or hit the box first. Get  wall weapons and at least  perks before you even consider the box. Seriously the mp with DT can carry you past round  with zero issues in most bo maps. In origins specifically grab the AK to start and the mp when you get out of the trenches and youre fine till you have pretty much everything opened and usually a staff if not an upgraded staff.On a more personally satisfying or sadistic note Im glad there are some bo first time players trying the old games and understanding why a lot of long time players consider bo so easy or casual. xD good luck man!

11676364,0,t3_66hfsu,IW just feels really cheap. Not even just the concepts of movie themes the whole game and shooting mechanics in general. Something I dont see anybody mention is the actual feel of how treyarch does its gunplay and sound design. Theres so much more gravitas and oomph to everything. Guns in IW feel like toys and the zombies like action figures. Exo Zombies managed to do the gunplay and sound design very admirably and I just feel IW doesnt bring any of that immersive aspect with its shooting. Honestly I feel IW zombies wouldve actually been better had it further studied and followed in Treyarchs footsteps. I could even get behind the pop culture themes if they had payed more attention to the finer points of what made zombies so awesome. Guns that feel heavy deliberate and loud. Zombies with weight to their movement and sound design as opposed to what personally feels like a bunch of floppy skeletons in IW and maps designed to be interesting and flow well first and aesthetically thematic second something it seems IW struggles to understand with ZIS specifically being obnoxiously segmented and gameplay flowing like wet cement. IW zombies isnt really bad. Its just the NERF to SH and Treyarchs paintball so to speak.,CODZombies,dgjj67z,2,t5_2sal9

DLC personalization items are completely optional and are not required to play Call of Duty Advanced Warfare Multiplayer. As you can see DLC can have several meanings. But also maps of course.

11798281,0,t1_dgws56c,while the pc is superior it depends what type of player he is.  For example if he enjoys public games or only playing with friends and his friends are on console.... it makes sense to play on console then since pc has a smaller user base.Shrug I got black ops  on pc and xbone but Ive only ever played custom maps on pc since waiting in a lobby for  minutes on pc is just retarded lol.  Same with IW my chick has that on pc and Ill be damned I can literally sit in a lobby all night and only get one or two other players in the lobby and have the game never ever start unless its the newest map a week or two within release. TLDR OP might like playing with other players and not know anyone on pc to play with so console may be better for him considering pcs tiny user base.,CODZombies,dgxdj9c,1,t5_2sal9
