1764076,0,t1_ck1il1m,Theyre fine but generally theyre CT not VT so they die easier and have a harder time digging in and all of their infantry are rifle teams. Germans get rifleMG MG or one of those with panzerfaust. So when it comes to defending Germans have more options. ,flamesofwar,ck1io15,1,t5_2rmpm
2774952,0,t1_cnjhy5e,Hm. Could you put this in WarmachineInfinityk terms for me?Are these different army books offering different versions of a core german list or should I assume this is like a totally different army book that happens to also be the Nazis? ,flamesofwar,cnji2ax,1,t5_2rmpm
3019404,0,t1_coay3kn,Yeah but without the easys and Jumbos and all the other stuff for the same price as a tank horde which sadly I would take over the hero tankovy any day but I hate running strait armor. It never wins especially in late war.,flamesofwar,coayiq2,1,t5_2rmpm

6518072,0,t1_cztfujv,Its better to take more Ts if you want to kill big cats specifically the flanking and bodies matter more against those whilst the ISUs and IS have problems firing on the move. a King TigerKT has a front of  which a AT gun works about as well against as a AT one ie you shouldnt bother.ISs and ISUs and SU are great against allied heavies everyones mediums and dug in infantry. Of course T are good offensively against everyones mediums and ok vs inf but if you face opposing Tankovy Churchills Panzerspam or dug in vets the soviet heavy tanks and assault guns pull through. Theyre also more suitable for defense whilst T are more offensive tools. So a strelk variantalwaysdefend list facing lots of medium to light heavy tanks and vet inf wants the soviet heavy dept whilst tankovy forward detachment and motostrelk just want more Ts. This is also valid for the other IS tanks and KV series.Then the remaining soviet assault guns SU SUM and SUM. The first one is a T without MGs or turret but cheaper and CatKillerswhich doesnt kill KTs or JagdPanthers or SturmTigers sadly but will kill normal Panthers and Tigers to make that main gun matter more if you didnt move. The second one is a heavy from the front medium from the side with the same  setup as the SU otherwise. Its best guarding something with cover from the sides or attacking something with only one angle of fire on you but its quite good at that.The SUM is a completely different beast its a light assault gun with paper for armor but its dirt cheap. Its  uses are digging out gun teams  or lacking those regular infantrykilling transports ambushing sidearmor of medium or light tanks in defensive lists only mind you and dying like flies to make a cheap spot of concealment for your other tanks. Remember soviet smoke is either the carcasses of your deceased tanks or a flamethrower. or youre an always attack infantry list in which case you do have assault smoke but other problems,flamesofwar,cztipj3,3,t5_2rmpm
7392696,0,t3_4gjk40,Check out Forces.flamesofwar.comIt lets you build lists and you can search by unit type.   Look for find companies for a given item on the right side of the page beneath the Quick Filters.  Not all of the Early War books are available.  However the Valentine Crusader II and Churchill are all available in the North Africa book which is MidWar.  For example you could take Churchill IIIs and Crusader II in a Motor Company list  from the NA book.,flamesofwar,d2ii0cn,2,t5_2rmpm

8626394,0,t3_4xz4nx,Thanks for all the suggestions. Im headed to the local store this evening and Ill take a look around. Ill get the rule book for sure and see if anything peaks my interest. Right now the Open Fire kit is in the lead cause I like the idea of having enough to play around with and then build off of that. ,flamesofwar,d6jwi1x,1,t5_2rmpm
9034021,0,t1_d6nz28d,Sorry for what may an obvious answer so which of the two would you suggest getting if you want to play modern rules? Do you want the FOW rules or the Open Fire rules?,flamesofwar,d7xqvkg,1,t5_2rmpm

9786504,0,t1_dair6uk,The problem with Late War German air support is that its Sporadic so its very hit or miss. Itll either show up and do damage potentially a lot since late war allies players tend to skimp on the AA or it can not show up at all. Spending the points on more artillery or AA is usually a better choice since theyre more reliable  That being said though your revised list isnt a bad one by any measure. I personally prefer towedfixed AA over mobile AA but thats just a personal preference thing Wirbelwinds and Mobilwagens arent bad choices. ,flamesofwar,dajeedo,3,t5_2rmpm
