2741304,0,t1_cnew8sq,I do use PWM signals at work would be beneficial to learn how to generate them.,microcontrollers,cnfob1u,1,t5_2qjky
3290670,0,t3_2xtnbe,Seems to me like if you know the tools used with each for example for PIC the Microchip IDE is MPlab and the programmer is PICkit  and can read a datasheet its something you should be able to bs your way through.,microcontrollers,cp3d2od,2,t5_2qjky
3909263,0,t3_33l5le,The PIC architecture is ancient and the parts exist mostly for legacy support.  You can actually get more powerful parts in the PIC and PIC families for less money.  The PIC architecture isnt really the greatest for learning microcontrollers either.  That the prof is still teaching a class using it is a sign that he is too lazy to update his course to a more relevant processor.I wouldnt really dedicate any more time to the PIC than is necessary to get a good grade in the class.,microcontrollers,cr1w2xf,2,t5_2qjky
4986252,0,t3_3j7wkz,Oh yes avrfreaks is an online forum dedicated to avr related chips. Lots if help on the atmega line.Also look up drogon.net I think. He helped develop a board called the Gertduino which is a stack on board for the Raspberry Pi another awesome board.,microcontrollers,cun10i3,3,t5_2qjky

5860531,0,t3_3vi68r,Pins and Bits are completely different. Dont confuse them.A Bit is a logical concept. like Integers in Math. It can be zero or one. Never anything inbetween or undefined.A Pin is the physical piece of metal coming out of a chip. There is a Bit somewhere in the CPU that controls the Pin. Usually setting the Bit to  means set the Pin to  Volts and setting the Bit to  means set the Pin to  volts.  Sometimes we label the state of the pin as High or Low corresponding to the Bit being  or . Note you never get exactly  volts or  volts  there are losses all over and voltages fluctuate over time.But Pins are physical things. They cant go from V to V instantly they have to go thru  Volts and all the other numbers in between. The transition time is called slew.So how do we know if its High or Low? Read your data sheet. For example some chips will label above . volts as high and below . volts as low. There is often a grey area in between where things can be randomly high or low.  In a welldesigned system the slew is so fast that you wont notice the grey area.   We usually have pullupdown resistors to prevent things hanging around in that grey area.Bonus note We pretend that there are Bits flying around inside the CPU. But really CPUs have internal lines that carry voltages just like pins. If there is a design flaw or a stray gamma ray a bit can be flipped inside the CPU causing errors.,microcontrollers,cxnufm7,4,t5_2qjky
6059315,0,t3_3ygcpc,I think that one of the greatest advantages of running your code on top of a kernel not necessary Linux is task and memory management. If you just want to run simple linear application which doesnt need multitasking IPC or memory management then theres no need for the kernel. If you would want to run something more advanced on bare metal  you would have to implement all these features by yourself.,microcontrollers,cydve8m,1,t5_2qjky

6857278,0,t1_d0thsbb,gt but keep in mind that PICs differ widely in terms of peripherals.Yeah they do.I really wish Microchip would add a pseudoinstruction to turn off all of the comparators ADCs op amps and whatnot and just set all the pins to digital IO. Every time I learn a new PIC I have to go through and reengineer a setup routine to turn off all of the peripherals. This is why Im still using Fs instead of the newest toys.,microcontrollers,d0tkxl1,1,t5_2qjky
7284948,0,t1_d25p6m1,Aliexpress is kinda like ebay or amazon for Asia. There parent company Alibaba is one of the biggest companies you never heard of. They have really great buyer protection. Pretty much if your not happy you get a full refund. There is a bit of a negotiation process. You can offer to pay  and such.Ive purchased all kinds of electronic components and such from the various buyers. Out of like  transactions Ive had one no show which I got a refund for and then it showed up  months later. I also had  not as described and I got a  refund as they were still usable for other things. There are some fakes on there. Its not always the sellers fault they bought a sleave of ICs or transistors at the market labelled as X and its actually the cheaper Y. Read the feedback and such.Generally nothing is UL or CSA approved. So if its connected to mains its use at own risk. Pretty much everything there is use at own risk. All that said its incredibly cheap. I pay less than  of what I would pay from an American shop and get free shipping on most orders. The free shipping is slow typically around  weeks. You can often pay extra for Fedex and have it within a week.I think the quality is generally pretty good. You do get what you pay for. With electronics this hasnt been an issue. With some of the mechanical bits Ive picked up the  part has been piss poor but the  part is on par with the  US part. ,microcontrollers,d26904c,1,t5_2qjky
