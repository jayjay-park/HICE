297917,0,t1_cfbmwjy,gtYoud think people need to be yknow paid to do it.    And how many will be keen to pay month for game thats outdated even before launch? Dont get me wrong  I dont have problem with subscriptions. I just dont see it hapening  its the same story as it was with SWTOR from MMO standpoint it doesnt offer anything that wasnt offered in the past and now is available for general audience free of charge. Besides people were paying there for  months before it colapsed into greedy FP variant  do you think anything was done for these  months? Nope nein nada niente  NOTHING. Also SWTOR in FP is racking up more money than it was in PP because when it was PP it was ghosttown  months after release even people who argued that its completely fine bailed out from the game after that time. Do you think their staff servers and bandwidth is free? Resuming  if one want people to pay subscription he should think if quality of his product stand up to it. And keep in mind I dont mean bugs here regardless it would be retarded to complain about bugs in beta stage. TESO is special case since along subscriptions there will be microtransaction store in game... its like pay subscription so you can enjoy FP perks... thats higher level of greediness unseen before this.As for FP being worst models in online gaming. It greately depends on the exact buisness model. Take TERA as an example  everything you can pay for is simply quality of life or cosmetics. Then on the opposite you have games like Perfect World which is straight out PW also propably the most expensive one at this point in time. SWTORs FP version is pain in the arse to play but is certainly NOT PW. Overall FP isnt bad if its executed right.,teso,cfbn8dz,1,t5_2u140

754381,0,t3_22rkdl,Is the Rings of Mara bonus account or characterspecific?Updated   AM          Published   AMgt The Ritual of Mara can be used once on one character. Until it is used it can be stored in your bank. Once you perform the ceremony and get your rings you must wear the ring and be grouped with the character you performed the ritual with in order to get the experience bonus.

763448,0,t1_cgq0tog,For comparison I sell a bit of stuff but mostly deconstruct items and share mats with friends so at level  I have a bit under k after a bank upgrade and two bag upgrades.,teso,cgr263s,1,t5_2u140

977918,0,t1_chfbstq,Capping recipes learned sounds pretty stupid IMO and I hope it is not the case...How would you unlearn them. If you have the skill points in it and are level  you should be able to learn it.Let me know what you find out OP.,teso,chfg4p4,1,t5_2u140
998983,0,t1_che56we,so ive got no errors or prompts. i click on the file eso i get the little blue circle cursor for a moment and then nothing. i can click eso as many times as i like it just repeats this very short cycle.  edit actually it doesnt do nothing it runs eso.exe and i can see it running in Task Manager. i can keep clicking it and it will keep opening new instances of eso.exe and thats the closest i can get to playing.,teso,chhubln,1,t5_2u140

6602667,0,t3_44w3ft,if you are going to craft food learn every recipe you find so when you find the ingredients for them later you will have it.  Then sell the ones you already have.,teso,d029qn7,1,t5_2u140
7124184,0,t3_47pw30,If youve been living in a cave in Iraq for the past  years prolly dont buy ESO first. Go backwards find AT LEAST TESOblivion amp TESSkyrim. Those should catch you up on  of the massive amounts of Game  World lore... Which while not always critical very much usually entertaining. Just my humble or not so humble opinion. TES  ESO Tamriel Unlimited all tie together... And Ive gotta think that not knowing why Molag Bal is a tireless douche Prince or why Meridia throws little Holy monkey wrenches into his plans plots and schemes... What exactly IS the Amulet of Kings and why is this G trinket the end all be all of all things Tamriel...  Or ya know why Orcs hate why Nords drink... Why Dark Elves hate even themselves why Imperials are such Narcissistic asshats .... Or dont. Just jump in to ESO and play blind. It wont ruin my experience. By the way all TES games start out with maddening negativity. Thats half the fun. By the nd patch everything is generally shiny enough to not crash to desktop  xmb  whatever. And the rd party mod community is nothing short of fantastically amazing and creative. Enjoy.,teso,d1nxr4n,1,t5_2u140
