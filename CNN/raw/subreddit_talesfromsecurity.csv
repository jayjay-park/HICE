282755,0,t1_cf9x8bb,Luckily the responce time here is pretty good  minutes otherwise Id carry. Its actually pretty weird. Downtown and at certain sites they are allowed to carry mace and they have armed posts but for some reason they dont let us have anything. All the other hospitals in the area have more PPCT training and more defensive weapons than us mace off duty cops. Its just stupid not to considering we are within a mile of a active military base with people obviously threatening to blow their heads off,talesfromsecurity,cfa2kzd,3,t5_2vw8q

They way you described it in my region that guy would have a laundry list of charges against him including several weapons offenses and probably attempted murder since he actually had to go get his gun from his car before using it.

1370812,0,t1_cilrk0r,Every facility should have forms that state this that parents  guardians are required to sign. You KNOW that a parent will verbally say okay fine and then try suing the facility anyway and now you have no proof that you informed them.I want to smack all the parents that think Im their childs babysitter. I work at a school as a receptionist. I sit at a desk. I cannot leave said desk except when I go in the office for something  which Im less than ten feet away. If your kid runs out that front door I cannot chase them. If they run into the street I cannot get them. So if your kid gets run over it is entirely YOUR fault. Im not a babysitter. Ugh.They should make people take a written test before theyre allowed to take their baby home from the hospital. Will you supervise them at all times? YES. Will you leave them in a hot car for two hours? NO. Heres your kid then!,talesfromsecurity,cio4bfw,3,t5_2vw8q
1433189,0,t3_29pyz2,I once did a similar job locked all night for several nights inside a place similarly to a Chuck E Cheese which was entirely within a  patrolled mall. Didnt even leave me a game turned on or a drink fountain or anything. The mall guards would come and say hi thru the gates once every couple of hours which is all that kept me sane.,talesfromsecurity,civxdr5,3,t5_2vw8q

2632571,0,t1_cn22gkw,Probably not the most exciting story but definitely funny at the timeThis lady who lived at the shelter around the corner used to come in all the time. Her name was Debbie. She was in her s and was definitely schizophrenic. She would come in and bathe herself in the bathrooms in the lobby and clearly thats not okay. One day I had to escort her out and she asked if I had seen prince William. That she was looking for him. I told her that I saw him go into the shelter and gnat she should look for him there. Thats when she started telling me she was the queen of England that she owned the hotel and that I was fired for kicking her out. Then she skipped on her merry way back to the shelter. Oh Debbie. ,talesfromsecurity,cn27li5,53,t5_2vw8q

11013037,0,t3_5x7zod,This reminds me of a general trend I saw while assigned to a large public entertainment venue as part of an overarching contract. I would work long shifts over the weekends usually  hour shifts Saturday and Sunday in addition to a pair of weeknights. It stood to reason and was always just my rotten luck to have a slew of incidents occur during the last two hours of my shifts each weekend. One of these usually included some kind of injury leading the Client Staff on site to request a report from security as documentationlegal coverageadded insurance. There was seldom a weekend I was there were I did not have something go wrong or warrant some form of added documentation.,talesfromsecurity,degap3c,3,t5_2vw8q

11414585,0,t1_dfpftrn,Excellent post. Effectively this is very close to the reasoning for why our policy is set up the way it is. A lot of people seem confused. The issue here is not ON DUTY law enforcement personnel whom we do allow to carry their weapons. This also includes those who are not in uniform but do have official business to conduct in the facility. Just the other day I allowed a detective to bypass the metal detector because he was visiting a trainee officer who had been injured during an academy exercise. ,talesfromsecurity,dfptynk,1,t5_2vw8q
