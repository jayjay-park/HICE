617224,0,t3_214lt2,If you watch at  when she learns of her arrest order shes doing an amazing job at putting on a brave face and downplaying her Ukrainian critics but its obvious from her expression that this is hitting her hard. To have your reputation stripped from you by people you once trusted to have your back even if you have an incredible chance to start over as she does is the kind of thing that makes you secondguess yourself at a truly fundamental level  you can bury yourself in work and future plans but everyone has moments of weakness. And while I think shes taking her fandom lightheartedly at the moment I worry that she might get the wrong impression that perhaps our support comes solely as a result of her physical appearance rather than the strength of her character her resolve and her persistence  in reality its those things that make her a role model! But that doesnt come across in outofcontext Natalinyaa pictures. So we need to be careful here  the last thing we want to do is to push this subculture to grow in a way that reduces her agency or adds to her selfsecondguessing. We should just keep this in mind as we continue to participate in this community and title our posts. And I hope that the people who interact with both the fandom and Natalia herself communicate to her all the respect we truly have for her.,nataliapoklonskaya,cgafgy1,7,t5_3104i

691997,0,t1_cgiwq3h,gtLook this is just what the Deputy PM said.Stop bullshiting and read the article maybe. They are moving them off the land that some Tatars have been squatting on mostly brick huts without proper electricityplumbingphone lines. They are not deporting them anywhere. The reason why they are living in legal limbo is because the Ukrainian govt. has just been ignoring it over the years they never approved it but they never had the will to do anything about it either. Moving them to proper residential areas within Crimea is not deportation. Please see the definition of deportgt . to expel an alien etc. from a country banish.. to conduct or behave oneself in a particular manner. ,nataliapoklonskaya,cgixka6,1,t5_3104i
