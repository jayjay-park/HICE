What I do have a problem is HOW he got across his opinion which I apparently need to explain for about a third time caused a needless shitstorm where everyone is yelling at everyone. I am not butthurt at all seeing how I would at least like to believe Im being coherent and calm while you are letting your emotions as opposed to the reasonable part of your brain seize control of your opinions. Also if the public HAD indeed noticed before Ethans video why was it up to Ethan perhaps the most chill guy on the internet to take on the issue. It seems to me that a large amount of people held Ethan in really high esteem and seeing him disagree with someone which again is completely justifiable and jumped on the KYS Leafy!!!! bandwagon. ,H3H3TestStylesheet,d19k9hc,1,t5_3awn3
