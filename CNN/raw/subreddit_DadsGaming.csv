1570110,0,t3_2azjgs,Hello all I basically just run Titanfall on the Xbox One and Black Ops  on the . Havent touched Ghosts in a while due to how bad it wasis. I am usually online early in the morning before work around amam then again after I get off and spend a little time with the family around pm after kids are sleep around am est On the weekends I usually run Blops  with some of my clan mates we all live in the same state for the most part.    If anyone of you fellas would like to add me please do so Gamer Tag is RAVEN MCKER the o is a zero and is in all caps so I wouldnt get team killed in blops  lol.        After running the beta for Destiny I seriously doubt I will get that game and am going to cancel my preorder. The Beta was really bad.    Anyways sorry for rambling I usually keep things short and sweet on that note hope to see some of you online.  BTW any of you experience problems with the party and chat on Xbox One?,DadsGaming,cjd34y6,1,t5_32bw1

5444627,0,t1_cw73vek,Dude Im adding you! We have the same schedule! Im est and play around   ish take a break to help my wife get ready for work and get myself and hop back on from about   ishshould be  even but I will admit to being late to work a few times for the sake of fufilling my Destiny. Sidenote if you do PvP there is a guy on here Boastkdv who has a similar play schedule I almost awlays see him on in the crucible. Id join up with him more if joining into to crucible was easier it needs a fireteam queue! Sidenote feel free to add me and sent an invite whenever you see me. Think I had you on my list at one point in time but I eventually end up chopping it down when I lose track of who is who. Also have the same thing about running solo because I dont wanna bug anybody unless some kind of special quest comes up everybody always seems to be doing something different. Ending this lengthy post soon Ive been thinking of trying to go and lfg and start doing bits and pieces of the raid every morning since I usually dont have time for a full run unless it is early Sat morning. Wanna try that out well have a guaranteed two and Ive run most of the raids with random groups its not that badBeat all VOG most of Crotanever done the very first part successfully and Ive beat oryx all with randoms. Nice to know Im not the only person who falls asleep before most events are over. Last note for real this time get up an hour or two early on a Sat and youll probaby find enough DADs on to do a Raid thats how I beat oryx for the first time. Woke up early Sat got sent an invite didnt finish but I randomly woke up at  and Mon and decided to try and find a random group to hit the checkpoint before reset and actually got invited back into the same group from before and got my first piece of  gethanks for the invite unwindaxis.,DadsGaming,cw7lqp3,1,t5_32bw1

6167612,0,t3_401f8f,I have no experience with the specific router you are describing.  However just to let you know that I had to set my XBox One to a dedicated IP address with my ASUS u router for the RainBow Six to properly work with hosting and chat for NAT. Prior to setting the Xbox as a dedicated IP it did not appear that the uPNP was working as expected.  Once set the unit to dedicated IP all was well.  No manual port forward entry needed.If you need help getting your Xbox setup to a dedicated IP address just try some googling and youll surely find a good example or two.Good luck!,DadsGaming,cyqoz15,1,t5_32bw1
