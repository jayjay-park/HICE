I dont get why youre so surprised that the service you have been using for a while knows your tastes better than one you havent uses as much.  ive had an amazing experience with Google Music so far and Ive found lots of awesome music.  It helps that Ive got  of my own songs uploaded too which helps it learn my taste.,googlemusic,cr8v3gs,1,t5_2s4xn

4750087,0,t3_3fxwe0,MA is just a container I guess Google supports MA as long as there is Apple Lossless music inside of that container. Is there another lossless coded Google supports like FLAC? If so you could transcode and then upload again. Also the filenames have kbit etc. in them so now they are in a lossless file but still kbit lossless doesnt magically add info and when you upload them Google will transcode to kbit MP. So youre ending up with ugly transcodes anyway. The only way to avoid this is to have them lossless from the source and then let Google transcode to kbit. ,googlemusic,cttal0o,1,t5_2s4xn
4902939,0,t3_3b93q6,Yeah its been happening to me to.So far it only affects songs from google.The songs I added with music manager from my original library are fine,googlemusic,cucjxrg,1,t5_2s4xn
4955487,0,t3_3ircj8,I cant say why Google does this. But it seems like a holdover from before they had a streaming service. Previously if you uploaded your music to Google you could create a radio station based on an artist song or genre not unlike Pandora. It would pick  related songs and shuffle them for you. These stations would start with songs and once you got to the last one more were added. The curated playlists seem to work the same way.Seemingly the playlists are prepopulated with songs since theres an option to download the whole playlist. Perhaps its done this way so the playlist is shuffled every time you play it and dont have to hear the same songs in the same order every time.,googlemusic,cuj6gyz,1,t5_2s4xn

6165516,0,t1_cyprww5,The weird thing is that its really good on the computer. Its just bad on the phone. Ill wait a few more days hopefully it just needs to sync something. In the beginning it asked me to choose some genres I liked. Maybe its because of that.By the way is there REALLY no other way than downloading every! album to get music offline? I have a    GB and want everything offline but to click every album.......... I know you can put everything in one playlist but does the functionality remain the same then?,googlemusic,cyqgew1,1,t5_2s4xn
6588829,0,t1_d00tstl,I cleared my cache signed out signed back in and then always made sure the album art says explicit.  For some reason if I played a censored version on accident an dthen switched to explicit it would still play the censored version.  So now I avoid anything that doesnt have the warning label on it.,googlemusic,d00u7co,1,t5_2s4xn

8614421,0,t1_d6idt9u,nope in the US. maybe Google doesnt want it to seem like theyre favoring their own services but as a GPM subscriber Id rather see results that I can use ,googlemusic,d6ief4x,1,t5_2s4xn
