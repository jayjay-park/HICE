9343230,0,t3_58fw86,Exlesbian. Im mixed and I grew up in a small town and went to a very small private and nondiverse school from kindergarten through th grade. I was one of  of  other minorities excluding my two younger brothers and the only one in my entire grade. I was always an outsider. I didnt fit in with the girls because I was way too boyish and I couldnt fit in with the boys because I was physically female. I always felt some type of samesex attraction though I didnt fully realize it until I was a teenager.As for religion my parents took me to a Hindu temple one week and a Catholic church the next. That was my exposure as a child. Their religions contradicted each other. To me it seemed like mindless tradition. The Hindu temple felt more like a social gathering for Indians and the Catholic church well I just never understood that. They would talk about Hell and then recite prayers like zombies.As soon as I could make at least some of my own decisions I got away from all of that. I told my parents I didnt want to go to a private High school and that I needed to be around more diversity. By this time I was an Atheist and I wanted nothing to do with religion. I had never seen a solid reason to believe in anything. Religion seemed fake and damaging. I also realized I was a lesbian and I didnt like that religion said it was wrong mostly for what seemed like no reason.I thought that people who believed in any type of god or gods were either ignorant unintelligent or crazy.  Especially Christians who I thought were the most hateful. I wasnt about to listen to  anyone who told me what I was doing was a choice or wrong. I didnt feel like I chose anything. I also believed that Christians were the ones who were bullying shaming and murdering people in the LGBT community.Fast forward to University and I had a horrible experience trying to hide my sexuality. I decided I was never going to put myself through anything like that ever again. I then found my identity as a queer woman.  I dated girls. I watched the Lword countless amounts of times was part of a gaystraight alliance HRC followed all the LGBT youtubers and participated in pride. I lived in the community. I finally fit in. I loved being a lesbian and what it felt like to be with women. I fell in love and eventually got married but despite all of this my life was really a complete mess. We fought with each other all the time and lived pretty irresponsibly. Our communication styles completely clashed. Shortly after the marriage my mom passed away and I got very depressed.  Overall my life felt pretty empty and meaningless. My wife eventually left me and that was the final blow.  I remember sitting in my living room crying and staring at my wrists. I wanted my life back but it felt impossible.Still staring at my wrists I remembered two distinct things that two different teachers taught me in school. The first was from  a teacher in th grade who told my class that if a person were to commit suicide they would die and go to Hell not saying this is true it was just what I remembered. The second was a quote I learned in AP English my senior year in high schoolI would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isnt than live as if there isnt a God and to die to find out that there is.I remember carefully considering these things and thinking What if Im wrong about everything? What if God is real? God are you real?Because I was afraid that there could be a possibility that I was wrong I stopped myself and got up to go to sleep and stop my mind from thinking. I laid in bed to sleep but I felt extremely jittery and heart was pounding fasterand faster. At one point I could feel the blood pumping furiously in my ears and my chest felt like it was exploding. I felt like I was dying. I thought for sure my life was over.I remember all of a sudden my inner voice started talking to me. It told me I was living in sin and needed to stop. I didnt understand how being a lesbian was a sin or a choice. I thought I was going crazy and just tripping from marijuana. I thought Yeah right god this isnt real but the moment I thought that I suddenly felt like I was falling faster and faster and I could feel my bodygetting hotter and hotter. It scared me to the core. I thought OK! OK! Im listening! when I thought that I suddenly stopped falling and God would speak to me again.This went on all night long because I kept thinking There is absolutely no way this is actually real. Why do You care about sin? Why do You care who I love? and the cycle of falling and then crying out for help repeated.I took away the following things from that night God loved me and He hated sin. He considered being a lesbian a sin. I was terrified from that experience and I didnt exactly understand it. I tried to push that night out of my mind and chalk it up to some kind of bad trip butI couldnt shake it.  I kept thinking there must be some way I got it wrong. I thought theres nothing wrong with being a lesbian after all homosexuality is everywhere inother forms of nature. I wanted to justify what I was doing because I didnt believe it was something that could change. I started reading the Bible  more specifically I started researching homosexuality in the Bible. I remember reading a number of articles over the next several weeks that went into detail how  God was OK with homosexuality. I read the points and agreed but still I remembered that night and how God told me it was wrong.I decided to read the entire Book of Ruth which was supposedly about a lesbian relationship myself just to be sure. I read it and immediately felt defeated.Spoiler Ruth marries Boaz a man. I knew somehow even though I didnt understand it I was wrong. Everything I read in the Bible pointed to homosexuality being sinful. After reading more I found these two versesgt Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed for ever. Amen. Romans I felt like this is what I was doing when I was looking at other parts of nature that exhibited homosexuality. Convicted.gt For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature Romans This was the most clear passage to me about lesbianism being a sin. Major conviction set in.Once I read those two verses I knew without a doubt I was wrong but I also thought I couldnt stop being a lesbian. I couldnt just choose to be straight somehow.After reading and reflecting on those verses I got on my knees and leaned my head against the wall. I told God I dont care anymore. I give up fighting. I believe this is sin. I believe You. I believe Your word is true. I believe You love me.What do I have to lose if You love me? I am scared of this but I will be single forever because I want to follow You.The moment I turned from sin and trusted in Jesus I wasnt a lesbian anymore. I felt like a new person. I absolutely couldnt believe it. I was overwhelmed.My entire life changed that day I wouldnt trade it for anything in the world. Gods plans are always better than ours.,Exhomosexual,d90bkrd,9,t5_3fy3r
