2082307,0,t1_cl4h8h1,Thanks for the encouraging words.I think I am not slowing down enough for these photos. I took these while unicycling at approximately kmhr however perhaps I could try something different just before approaching people slow down possibly hop once or twice then snap a quick photo. However Im not sure about the in your face flash then again whats a couple feet closer?Perhaps Ill work on that first and leave the shutter drags for another day.I do like how the contents of the car were frozen due to flash lighting but the outside got blurred. Im not sure how to apply that technique to people though.,streetphotography,cl4i9az,1,t5_2rpuv

3080214,0,t1_coh9644,So what I like about it is the red box red tie blue police square and blue accent on his bag. The eye contact. The guy walking the opposite direction to the left of the frame. I like the vertical lines in the background. I was trying to use the red box as a foreground element to help add color to the frame but I was too far away and didnt get close enough. I think if I would have stepped in and the red box was just a sliver along the far right of the frame it would have worked. So overall I think its a fail and could have been a good image had I gotten closer and composed the frame better. ,streetphotography,coh9fyh,1,t5_2rpuv
3210216,0,t3_2wuvh6,See how the hood pops out of the guys head if you stand back and look at it its odd. Does not work. A different angle would be better. Its also hard to tell how much depth is in the photo the vehicles hide the scene a bit seems really flat not sure if thats a bad thing but you could use that for a better image. I like depth In a shot but not everyone does. Keep it up that scene is interesting maybe spend a bit more time in a spot and look for the moments where life meets the surreal. A patient game but worth your time.,streetphotography,couql3d,2,t5_2rpuv

3692819,0,t1_cqcr0gn,Well Im just asking since you seem to know what art should or shouldnt be. Im just determining whether youre FOS or not.I agree that OPs photo is considered street photography but it is a style that the most vocal people in this subreddit of whom share the traditional approach or anyone that is dedicated to the genre dont particularly like. I think that if you ask Joel Meyerowitz or Colin Westerbeck  the two guys that practically invented the term street photography will tell you that this isnt particularly good. BUT like you said it still falls into the street photography genre. The real question as I always seem to bring up is whether its a good photograph or not... Thats subjective really. Its based on you me them every other persons opinion.In the end its all nonsense. This photo this discussion... Its spilt milk.,streetphotography,cqd7ewg,3,t5_2rpuv

6293291,0,t3_41npfk,Well done on conquering your fears getting up close and personal whilst out shooting street especially interacting with those you shoot I think you should be proud of them especially a first outing.I really loved the image of the old lady looking in the window at the clothing   if I could change one thing it would be crop the right to bring more focus on her rather than going down the street but it still works really well and you may lose ratio with the crop but I do love that shot.The homeless guy with the dog is a nice shot consider cropping it losing losing the space on the tiles below him.The hen party with all the girls may have looked better in colour especially the individual shot of the bride to be as the black and white lost all the detail of their outfits and its hard on the bride to be face so I would have kept the colour but thats just me. I do think you also done a great job converting them to black and white so well done and well done to the photography tutor on the workshop giving you tips.I have been looking at your website I would add an about you on your website gives us a focus if you excise the intentional pun on you as the photographer but you have captured some really great images loved so many but the one with the Victorian street with London in the distance is brill and although you say its a hobby your photography is spot on especially your architecture you really have a very good eye yes as you say still learning but arent we all and we will never stop learning then again apart from the know it alls  but keep shooting what you want to shoot and dont give your power away to keyboard warriors who knock your work just because of jealousy.

8014116,0,t3_4oyxcy,I miss Toronto definitely one of my favorite cities as of recent.Now about the work...As others have noted these are just pictures of people on the street  which doesnt automatically make it street photography. Usually in what I look for there has to be some sort of absurdity or juxtaposition between people and their environment with everyday life. It doesnt have to be anything spectacular or in your face ala Bruce Gilden but there has to be something in your frame that may reveal that there is more to what you regularly see on the street. Simply said something has to happen in your frame or atleast appear to.Another thing that I noticed was that you took multiple photos of the same subject street artist... Work on your edit NOT post processing and focus on which frame has the most potential.Usually street performersartistshomeless people are considered low hanging fruit in this genre... Its not a rule that is written instone but its definitely useful advice. Thats not to say that you CANT have a street performer in your shot  just dont make it the main subject.Have a look at the wiki as there are a TON of resources me and a few users have contributed to this sub.

8351643,0,t1_d5lfosf,Its not a bad scene but in itself it is rather unremarkable. Theres not much going on. The photo itself isnt doing or saying much. And its a pretty typical scene a man in a suit standing in front of a suit shop. I think the main advice I can give you and this is a perfect example we have to find some way of being objective when you look at our images when presenting them to a wider audience. Context and the emotions we feel while we are out doing our hobby are very powerful things but it doesnt necessarily translate in the images themselves. I have a huge number of photos which would seem hugely pedestrian to anyone not involved. Just because they are special to me doesnt mean they are for anyone else. And thats just a fact we have to learn to appreciate.You find that a helpful tool to try and stop this emotion getting the better of us is to delay viewing or developing photos after we have taken them. This is obviously easier with film than it is with digital but is by no means impossible. Try and sit on a photo for a while and maybe when you come back to it youll see that really there isnt much there.The great thing is that this can work both ways. Images which may have been pedestrian to take can seem beautiful canvases once addressed some time later.Keep it up and keep shooting ,streetphotography,d5libcy,3,t5_2rpuv
8351989,0,t1_d5liqkf,No worries  the legs being cropped relates to depth too  showing the whole figure will help to ground it in the frame at a perceived distance from the wall.

8929838,0,t3_51t1f0,Subject matter is compelling  not in a perverted context. Im very intrigued in passionate displays of affection on the street between couples and other relationships family members friends etc.Though with this sort of subject I believe that the shallow depth of field really lets it down  as if to say this is all there is and nothing else. I think it would have worked much better with a more conscious way of framing in front showing both faces as this one feels way too onthefly hipshotty. And with more context in the backgroundenvironment to show more than just the obvious... This one is a little too close I think you would have been much better standing further.Something along the lines of this one by Gus Powell,streetphotography,d7l8goy,1,t5_2rpuv

9222801,0,t3_56lzzc,Firstly Im not sure I agree with your editorialising I felt that the slaps were justified. So its OK for a restaurant higher up to assault a homeless man multiple times? A man desperate enough to steal from a tips jar? A man who is most likely mentally ill? This is the same rationality that condones the restaurant guy putting hands on you your camera.Second when you make a claim like Restaurant Employee Tried To Take My Camera!!! it would help if we could actually tell what is going on in the video. All that happens in your footage is we hear someone ask Why are you filming me? while some blurry film of a chair and door is recorded. Then it cuts to black. You also claim that the employee asked to see your camera under threat of smashing it. It would also help your case if this was actually seen heard in the video. Not saying it didnt happen but when you offer the video instead of an explanation its hard to make sense of what transpired. My question is this as soon as he threatened you or as soon as you were away from the threatening situation why didnt you call the cops? You ask why does this keep happening and what can you do to stop it?  part of the answer is turning situations like this into a headline. Let aggressive asshats like this guy know that he cant assault you or attempt to take your property. Maybe the next dickhead thinks twice when he remembers the story about the restaurant owner employee who copped an assault attempted robbery charge when he tried to take someones camera?Anyway dont let it get you down keep shooting and take care man. ,streetphotography,d8l239h,2,t5_2rpuv

I dont know who you are and you dont appear comfortable revealing any of your work so how can you demand that respect from me? If you are somebody notable As I said Im nobody then tell me who you are but dont expect people to treat you like you are one of the greats when you dont have the confidence to show a single photo. You dont have to upload to Reddit you surely have it somewhere else but you dont show it. Its mind boggling. You say youve been in magazines and galleries well so have I. It doesnt really mean anything. If you are in Magnum or something else at that level then that says something but otherwise its not really much.Anyway this dialog has grown old and unproductive. Your ego is bruised so I dont think anything will come of this. Good day.TL DRIm nobody and so are you. Get over yourself.,streetphotography,dacaotx,0,t5_2rpuv

No mention of red yellow or orange filters and how they impact contrast with bw photography which with the exception of a UV or soft filter are the only ones anyone would use on the street. How much do you make if some dummy clicks to buy the gradient or cpl filter for street photography? I can already see some poor noob trying to twist their cpl to cut the glare of a window while photographing some poor bastard in a coffee shop eating a bagel.

If youre unhappy about the way that I  or the many others who feel similarly  have represented your actions you could always try to clarify things in the many threads that have popped up lately. Why did you think it was reasonable to ban the majority of active and valuable users without warning or cause or even the capacity to cite a particular infraction either publically or in PM?Why did you think it was ok to cut the other mods out of the decision making process discussion?Why did you think it was ok to install your friend as a mod who has no knowledge experience in street photography or prior participation in the sub?

11381915,0,t1_dfm3sud,shrug Go ahead and keep using that particular phrase. You may mean one thing but people will just continue to think you have zero idea about how photography works. Regardless of your intention its a preloaded statement that pretty much screams ignore what I have to say similar to when you use phrases like Thats retarded. Seriously. Drop it as often as you can in various contexts vet photographers all the way to people dipping their toes in as well as other fields. See what kind of reactions you get when you directly juxtapose an opinion with a tool.Its also pretty telling how you think self improvement doesnt involving discussing others work so that you can better articulate whats working whats not and how to apply that to your own work. Or that you think not being able to execute excellent images yourself somehow precludes you from discussing and identifying what does or does not work in others images. Are you unable to identify a good film because you havent created an excellent one? Are you unable to recognize good writing when you havent written anything thats been lauded? Right.You may have  years in photography but your understanding of critical discussion on images doesnt seem to have even gone through a photo  class where aside from the bare technicals they pound into you the importance of how critical discussion both on your work and your thoughts on others is the key to growth. Which is why I bring up historical posting context. Its pretty clear from my posting history Im actively seeking what I think works and what doesnt and receiving feedback on if Im on the right track or if Im dead wrong and I have no problem with that. You have very little in this sub which again theres nothing wrong with. But with that theres little context for your comments.,streetphotography,dfm4czk,1,t5_2rpuv
