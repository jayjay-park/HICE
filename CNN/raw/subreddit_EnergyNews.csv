8628921,0,t3_4xxmyq,I used to say that a car that is good for  of your needs is worthless. I still believe that.  of the cars on the road have only one person in them. A car with only one seat would be good enough for  of your needs. ... so why dont people make or buy them? A car that you cant use  days a year  and you dont necessarily know WHICH  days a year  is a bad car. Ive had cars with that level of reliability. It sucks.  coverage is about where it becomes doable. For  days a year you can rent a car that will work for you. Of course if youre going on vacation and driving  miles there  miles back and staying a week that doesnt really work either.,EnergyNews,d6k7x61,1,t5_3b3nt
