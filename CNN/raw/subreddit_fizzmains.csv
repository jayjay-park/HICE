6252416,0,t3_415ocn,i havnt tried it yet but i dont think its a real nerf since you can buy lichbane now which is realy strong right now. it will either delay your lichbane or zhyonias powerspike though.,fizzmains,cz0byst,2,t5_34mwu
6447926,0,t1_czm95kt,its the same with champs like talon and katarina vs fizz the first one to waste their gapcloser will die its mostly skill matchups but vs katarina fizz has the upper hand due to the knockup in his kit to stop her ulti,fizzmains,czm97nq,2,t5_34mwu
6761948,0,t1_d0iqmay,Yeah i just feel pretty crap that theyre nerfing talon and going by the simularity of the  champs i just have a feeling theyll go for fizz next when they changed fizz due to the dfg removal he was alot better as on hit top lane which really messed fizz up imo.. because hes made to be an ap assassin they fixed problems and created more which is kind of why im abit sceptical when it comes to the current state of fizz and his ulti if theyre just randomly nerfing talon it cant really be duskblade making talon strong because he had a higher winrate without it and still a really small play rate,fizzmains,d0iqtld,0,t5_34mwu
6762026,0,t1_d0iqtld,The preseason item changes also hit Fizz with Morellos getting nerfed and the gold increase across the board with AP items like Zhonyas. Despite the community outcry about Fizz hes pretty balanced. The only thing I can see Riot maybe doing is adjusting cooldowns on his E. But again its harder to get  CDR as quickly as he did last season.,fizzmains,d0ir54m,1,t5_34mwu

7679902,0,t1_d3e1kcb,Agree with this here. Morello is super well rounded on Fizz and a great first item. After that you can go Abyssal or Zhonyas depending on matchup follow it up with a Lich Bane a Deathcap and a Voidstaff and you have a really solid build ,fizzmains,d3f5q37,2,t5_34mwu

7807463,0,t3_4m94n7,Im not that mad about the e nerf as  seconds is still pretty short for one of the best moves in the game. I think the passive nerf however is absolutely ridiculous. His passive will now be the worst in the game it offers you almost nothing..,fizzmains,d3tmdum,7,t5_34mwu

7961649,0,t3_4o716k,Bronze here but watch Fate play a lot and he explains it quite nicely.When you face people who can dodge your E you go W. If you go against a mageimmobile champion you max E. I dont think maxing the same thing is smart. Or if youre really comfterable with Fizz you can max W.,fizzmains,d4ayqu3,2,t5_34mwu
8028648,0,t3_4p4dv9,. Always hybrid pen fizz does a lot of physical damage over a game you can just look on the damage charts after a game and you only lose like  points worth of mpen to gain like  arpen its def worth it for most ap champs that auto often specially fizz.. Morello is very good on fizz now it has a easy build path tomes and has a good powerspike it gives you  cdr early which is quite a bit to play with gives you some mana and a lot of AP plus the wounds mechanics which is very useful against a lot of champs that are T in the meta right now.I dont like rushing sheen because its just going to be dead there for a while since you DO NOT want to rush lich bane lich is more of a rd or th item now because it doesnt do a lot without AP and all the individual ap value from items got reduced basically you want your core items first which are  MorellosAbyssal and Hourglass before you even think about building Lich you can maybe go it second in some cases if you do not need hourglass ASAP but thats very situational.. About maxing order you dont wanna have a set order as every game is different both E and W are viable to max first usually you want to max W against champions that can dodge your E very easily so you cant use it for reliable damage like yasuo for example while of course they cannot dodge ur autos against immobile squishies then E max is good and its also good for pushing and roaming power while W gives you more all in damage with ult but less mobility. After you have one of the two maxed you want to max the other one second leaving Q last Q imo simply isnt worth to max nd because it just doesnt give enough per rank up sure less CD is nice but you gain virtually no damage from lvling it and the mana cost also increases while maxing W second gives you more damage and the mana cost stays the same.. Azir is definitely a hard champion to play against simply because he bullies you early game WHILE heavily outscaling you if you do not shut him down if he shoves into your tower you have to all in him asap and get the snowball going or you need your jungler I also find Zed a very annoying lane simply because you cannot kill a good one cause hexdrinker is OP against aps in lane and hes going to shove you out all the time most immobile squishy mages are easy lanes if you know how to play the first  levels in laning phase which is vital for every matchup really.,fizzmains,d4ihu8g,2,t5_34mwu
8690434,0,t3_4wfagd,Slightly necrod so I apologize. However when do you find yourself selling revolver? I like to build Morello on fizz as a first item. What do you think about the item for fizz? I usually go MorellogtLichgtabyssalzhonyas. If i rush revolver would you suggest selling revolver after first or second item? Perhaps after Morello and Sheen?Thanks for dropping your advice on your fellow fishy brethren!,fizzmains,d6rxksw,1,t5_34mwu
8722130,0,t3_4zgw24,Honestly... you are a rookie with Fizz. First of all you need cs try to have  cs in  mins or at least close to that. Second less deaths  better grade If you get a kill but you die forget about it. You also need to get objectives or to help your team do it. Long short story  Be the guy that the enemy team flame cuz you are everywhere help your team and kill with cold blood as many minions you can . Good luck.,fizzmains,d6vwnzx,2,t5_34mwu
9056392,0,t1_d80ev5e,I feel like there should be something more to his W than just pressing it before we Q. I was thinking something similar to a yasuo Q would be nice does some damage and it would help us in lane for getting minions since we dont have a ranged Auto or ability. Obviously this is all speculation we have no idea what riot is doing with Fizz W so  hit passive or not is all on them.,fizzmains,d80fm25,1,t5_34mwu
9391664,0,t1_d96f81x,gt My other question is about mobility. Riot stated the hardest to pin down and peel above all other assassins but im not seeing that. His cds are too long late game with no resets. Leblanc and kassadin are more mobile and harder to pin xown sith super low cd kass and leblancs low cd and port back. Is there any plans to give him more mobility? Snd why is his movement speed the lowest among all assassins with no resetportbacks and no range in kit besides ult?I had a suggestion that were currently testing internally. Its a lot of fun and I hope it goes live but unfortunately I cant disclose more information and confidence in the change is low because its so late into the process.,fizzmains,d96gkpd,4,t5_34mwu

10075458,0,t1_dbkujv9,Fizz RW does about the same damage as Syndra QR would. more AP scale less base damageFizz R does AOE damage and has both a slow and a knockup.Syndra R isnt instantly doing all the damage. you need to have your balls around which takes time to achive so it has a delay too.Fizz R has more rangeFizz is very mobile while Syndra isnt at all. immobile champions are often stronger simply because of them being immobileNot saying that Syndra should be able to do what she does but I dont like it when people show wrong things. and she does have a few reasons to do that.Btw if were talking about burst damage have you heard about the tiny master of .k AP evil?,fizzmains,dbkuqq1,1,t5_34mwu

10783708,0,t3_5u949q,If you get counterpicked you just have to stay relevant by getting as much cs and xp as possible.
