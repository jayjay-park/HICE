1143989,1,t1_chyat14,You can say They dont feel like old Harvest Moon games you can not say They are not Harvest Moon games.Of course your opinion is valid of course the facts cant and wont change anyones feelings but neither can opinions change what the games are named.Im not trying to be negative or purposefully antagonistic just saying what is. Please dont read it with a negative bias.My opinion is that I liked A New Beginning the most out of all the Nintendo handheld Bokuj Monogatari games since FoMTMFoMT though I like Hero of Leaf Valley best. I am also excited for Story of Seasons since it is the next step along the A New Beginning development path but if Harvest Moon The Lost Valley pulls off a great retro Harvest Moon experience I will probably enjoy that too because I am an old fogey and Ive been with Harvest Moon since the very first game.There is room in the world for all kinds of fans and I like talking to other people about these games even if we dont always agree.,harvestmoon,chyb6sr,2,t5_2s3kr

1318557,0,t3_2968xx,A simple supplydemand feature would help show ahead of time what people want. Then you have to have some planning as you meet the supply for one crop the price drops so another is more valuable so its not always growing just  crop for money.Example Corn is in high demand and Tomatoes are in medium demand. Corn pays  more and tomatoes  more each so youd want to plant corn for the most money. The demand curve works such that there is a fixed amount to supply to meet demand which causes prices to drop eventually to normal then lower prices. For example you over supply Corn prices could drop to  below normal price so you are making less money. So making more money requires you balance out how much you grow. If you arent careful suddenly all the corn you planted is not worth as much as the tomatoes you can grow. To balance out the over supplying over time the demand creeps up as people use up the supply so prices return to normal.Dont have a solution for the money problem yet Ill think of one eventually.,harvestmoon,cihydkt,2,t5_2s3kr

As for tool upgrades yes you can never upgrade them you have to do one plot at a time.  You can hire harvest sprites to help you with your farm though.  There pretty useless at first but if you raise your chemistry friendship points with them they should get better.As for the villagers they go up to the mountain and walk around the outside of your house.

It might be something to consider if you come across a copy cheap now that its quite old.  If you would rather prefer more repetition any of the older hm games is ok for this purpose. RF changes dialogue more often so its more of a challenge and I get that feeling that it was meant for a little older audience than HM considering the amount and complexity of the kanji. If thats not what youre interested then a HM title would still be the better choice. Out of the  you chose Id go with ToTT. Its the less stressful of the .

7754446,0,t3_4ldme3,I actually agree with you. In my opinion the farming has improved drastically. I love the new crop system and its a lot less tedious imo and allows me to focus on other things like villagers and crafting items. HOWEVER I find the characters a lot more  dimensional. A Wonderful Life is hands down my favorite game. I love the girls and their stories. I feel at home in Forget Me Not Valley. I feel like I genuinely got to know them. I love the chapter progression and the finite ending. Is it perfect? No. But is it my favorite? YES. It was my first HM game. Animal Parade is a close second. There was so much variety and such a large area to explore. I could go on for hours about it Im ranting at this point. I love this game series and I want the depth we used to have with the characters. In SoS Elise was the closet thing I got to that. Im not sure how I feel about the new game but I do like the nongender fox spirit. To me marriage is the end all. I stop playing once Im married now,harvestmoon,d3nmf29,4,t5_2s3kr

8060609,0,t1_d4m2st8,Lets face it. They could have put all of the tutorial into only a single day of training or even less. And the missing shipping bin was one of the reasons I kept refraining from buying the game for the longest time. I didnt like the idea. The problem solves itself pretty quickly though and its a very enjoyable game in the end. The tutorial does add a lot to the story imo.  Which isnt obvious at first and Id leave it at that. ,harvestmoon,d4m36fu,2,t5_2s3kr
8063307,0,t1_d4m77tg,Do you have a Japanese DS. Is it definitely region locked do you think?Well. I need to study Kanji I guess.... if there any Ofurigana or just straight up kanji? Mostly for foods and animals or even for just regular conversations too?Thank you!,harvestmoon,d4me3z9,1,t5_2s3kr
8080881,0,t3_4pvpte,my biggest pitfall was only staying in Bluebell make sure you to go Konohana regularly. Check their request board. Befriend important people the blacksmith and the girl who can give you new clothes her name escapes me right now. You can look up lists of good gifts to give them for friendship points but the blacksmith loves bamboo which is pretty easy. There are items you can only unlock from people in Konohana and they are season dependent! Good luck ,harvestmoon,d4od6xe,2,t5_2s3kr

10613365,0,t1_dd6vvch,While I appreciate that there are finally more HMSOS clones out there I wish it didnt take so long and the success of Stardew Valley to make it happen. It seemed like everyone who was a die hard fan of these games were clamoring for something like this to happen for the pc for  years now and it finally happened in a big way. Even though that game was made from only  person he took a risk set the bar for these types of games so incredibly high and deserves every penny he made from the game. Where was everyone else before this game happened? I probably wont get any more kinds of games like these unless it has at least an equal amount of polish and reputability now. And I definitely wont go for early access games since I like to experience these games as complete when playing for the first time just like SV.,harvestmoon,ddaorpu,6,t5_2s3kr
10762672,0,t3_5txasw,Harvest Moon Back To Nature had individual songs for each girl. So HMFoMT would too since its a direct remake right?I have the song from BTN on my computer I could wetransfer you not sure its the same one though.,harvestmoon,ddq390e,1,t5_2s3kr
10868952,0,t3_5v61g3,FoMT is my favorite tied with HM.  BTN was really fun but I like the things they added in FoMT.  Im happy that they came out with BTN on the Playstation.  I didnt know about the Harvest Goddess game until a decade after I started playing it.  That game is so stressful!  But its a good way to make money.,harvestmoon,de11zr7,2,t5_2s3kr
11070412,0,t3_5xzct9,Ive only ever loved fomt btn and mfomt. The charm from those games never translated well into the newer games as hard as Ive tried to love them just as much. They really just need to release an updated version of friends of mineral town with more character events and longer gameplay. Thats my dream.,harvestmoon,demtk81,4,t5_2s3kr

11428661,0,t3_631miw,i love the idea of Harvest Moon i really do. but i just cant get into it. Ive bought almost every DSDS titles and even the iPhone game but it doesnt keep my interest to play in the long run. Ironically i do enjoy playing the farming games from the app stores. ,harvestmoon,dfrfdcb,2,t5_2s3kr
11559331,0,t3_64gxmt,I always do a theme which depends on what Im feeling when I name my first animal.When I was younger I named them after characters from my favorite games ex Link Midna Ilia from Twilight PrincessOn my most recent game I named them using old lady names out of style names like Agnes Maude etc. but only ones that started with the first letter of their species Chickens would be Cheryl Carol Candy amp ducks were Daphne Dolores etc.,harvestmoon,dg6966q,3,t5_2s3kr

11782820,0,t1_dgvlw2x,I havent played any RF game. I want to though. How does the PS game compare to RF? That one caught my attention because of the D beat em up aspect. But people keep bringing up RF so I guess I should try that one out first especially since I already have the console. Dont have PS just PSIt sounds good.,harvestmoon,dgvmcxx,1,t5_2s3kr
11788419,0,t1_dgw922j,AWL mostly glitchy for the PS version.Starde Valley just came out on PS a bit back. But I really recommend you try it. It plays perfectly fine on a PC though I will agree that the series is best played on handheld. I hope SV comes out on Switch so that we can play on the couch kicking back or something.,harvestmoon,dgw993s,1,t5_2s3kr
