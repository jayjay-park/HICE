405528,0,t1_cfmss1c,MCGamer Team LGOur friend Nebris is dead! Just kidding hes inside the restroom. Nebris returns and welcomes the audience back as MC tries to get out of an Abandoned Mineshaft. MC announces he found  gold and heads to the restroom himself. Screw the shift Ill go quick. I run now. MC runs to the bathroom and yells something to his housemates. This an intense game Nebris sagely notes. MC chows on an apple and gets to . hearts. Remember the code letters MC tells Nebris. Oh God. In silence the team moves across a hilly mountainous region. Quiet walking is a pretty good strategy and this team is looking like the best chance the field has of taking down Pause. The two move through a Roofed Forest on the treetops in dead silence a good strategy but honestly not the most video friendly one. Night falls as LG hops from rooftop to rooftop and MC eventually speaks up. I think were good. Should we hunker down? Its dangerous out there. Were in the most dangerous biome other than the Nether. Which is where Doc Doc dies. Right on cue. Deciding what to do MC guarantees Nebris ArkasUnpause will be on the surface. With Generiks voice entering LG gets scared again. Shhhh shhhh Im relogging. Im not in yet either. Shhhh shhh. After Generik leaves MC and Nebris start talking again. Wheres the moongod. Its midnight. They continue on treetops with Nebris trying to be quiet and careful with his horde but MC gets him to stop. If they hear us woohoo. Day comes it seems that the center is LGs goal. Nebris is being super serious and MG is tagging along. Sorry for the boring episode guys.Arkas Team Arkas Unpause Current Winning TeamIn a mountain area Pause and Arkas discuss their two kills and  player damage taken. Pause notes that Doc is in the area thanks to Guudes tip and Arkas admits hes still shaking. Theyre patrolling the surface and Arkas innocently asks if anyone went to the Nether. I dont think so it gives you an achievement doesnt it? And thats one that sticks out. LOL. Wow thats one of the most blatantly wrong thing Ive seen in UHC P. Im so surprised we havent heard that many voices says Pause with two kills. Arkas says it would be cool to win his first UHC which would put him up with MC and Old Man. Pause does note that no rain might be an unfair advantage and I think Pause would be fine. Heading to  Arkas suggests going a tower a la Zisteau and Pause immediately agrees. With  stacks of cobble between them theyre good. Suddenly they hear Pakratt saying theyre actually here and dying to Generik through the Nether. Arkas starts shifting and we can hear Generik and Baj. Generik mentions a Blaze Rod and Nether Wart and we can hear Baj cracking up at Doc going Fuck Fuuuuuck. Arkas tries to search for names underground and dig but nobodys anywhere. Thinking theyre underground ArkasUnpause starts heading down. Unlike the more freespirited  Sobriety this team is going to check if the team is in the Nether not going to risk it. Amazingly they break into an actual cave. Arkas whispers to Pause that theyre gone and hes right Ol Yeller did leave the Nether. Pause silently breaks up to the surface again. I dont think they can hear us here Arkas says before mobs jump the both of them at night. They run back in their staircase and Arkas chows his first UHC apple. Dawn thankfully comes and Pause decides to hunt Ol Yeller Arkas thinking they went east. This season has been defined by this Mumble plugin and despite a few glitches I think the hearing other voices is a good idea just not one Id want for every season as battles become silent. Pause does realize he never saw a name tag. They already have the Nether Wart...oh God.WrapUpArkasUnpause are still easily the frontrunners followed by a resurgence from LG. Right after that are the safe but low health  Sober and are right even with the very low health team of Ol Yeller. Ol Yeller is doing better than BTC because they have enchants and potion materials and BTC is lost in the Nether and alone.,MindcrackDiscussion,cfmss5h,3,t5_2y1ga

591644,0,t3_20w0qa,Ive always thought that forums would be better since day one.  I understand that reddit has a certain history and tradition built up by now and I further understand that trying to move the fandom en masse to a Mindcrackercontrolled forums would precipitate the drama storm of all drama storms.  If fans tried it themselves it would be very unlikely to take off unfortunately.  I still think it would be preferable to reddit.

599165,0,t1_cg85fb3,I dont like when people say someone doing a job like youtube Is just doing it for the money. Because thats obvious its a job you want to get money from a job dont you? Even if you like volunteering for charities youd still enjoy getting paid right?Again I dont see how its obvious theyre getting something like revenue share or big pay for advertising a server. As Id said any server is going to want advertising and they may give incentives sure but big money? I think a server like epiccloud would like to keep as much of that themselves as you say its pay to win and I agree that its kind of bad and grindy but you dont HAVE to pay to win like tons of other games you can just dick around in your rank doing a repetitive task until you get enough to go up a level and do the same thing over again. Its awful for sure but its not stopping you from advancing without paying exclusively.As for the children that are being targeted I dont know. There seems to be this stigma to trying to be bright and shiny and ooh look at the jingly keys but so what? Its not to your individual taste so they should revert back to how they were before? Why not let people grow in the direction THEY want rather than you want youre not the one in charge of their channel they are. If they want to appeal to a larger audience so be it if you think theyre focussing more on side projects I say so is kurt he rarely makes single person videos from mindcrack its mostly multiplayer stuff Bdubs and Genny are the same. Your mindset has pushed people away from a community because of a suspicion not proof. Well in Gennys case Bdubs left because the community were having trouble not being nitpicky and letting a man do his stuff how he wanted it done.,MindcrackDiscussion,cg8dn07,3,t5_2y1ga

1203976,0,t3_27we6g,Ive also been curious about the lack of enforcement on the rule You can only build within your teams designated biome. It seems both teams have minor infringements which is completely fine but it seems like somebody will eventually push too far. Arkas furthest frontline trench for example is built within nomansland but nobody has said anything about it yet. I imagine when the missiles start firing this trench will be ripe for targeting. Speaking of nomansland I interpreted this specific rule as this area was open for griefing explosions etc. but I could be wrong.Ive also been curious about the Team Hat rule which seems to have been implemented in the spirit of the Mindcrack Server deathgames. It has proven unnecessary so far as the Truce rule has been implemented. This means anybody can trespass but will be shot onsight unless communication is made beforehand. On the subject of Anderz base Blue Team seems to have less of a cohesive team and more of a domyownthing vibe to it than the Red Team. This shows in the amount of progress made which may also have something to do with the amount of time by team members spent online on team oriented machines farms etc. All the members seem to be relatively hesitant to do anything which may affect someone elses build. Red Team on the other hand have a lot more community driven builds.,MindcrackDiscussion,ci52d58,7,t5_2y1ga

Im just waiting for something new and exciting to really get into and at this point I dont really care whose channel it happens on. ,MindcrackDiscussion,cmog3kl,3,t5_2y1ga

2538601,0,t1_cmpu7nh,I think were misunderstanding the reason as to why reddits collective panties are in such a bunch about this.This entire situation is challenging our perception on what Mindcrack is. We know you guys do this full time. We know you constantly make business decisions based on views and making money. You have families to support and lives to live we get that.But its just never been in our face this much before. Nobodys complained about Scott on reddit and though youtube comments are youtube comments its been tame there. So its a shot to our collective blindside really.  Part of what has made mindcrack content unique is the perceived lack of career influenced decisions that happen. They happen all the time but theyre not usually in our faces. Heck the hate BTeam got over those server tour payoffs is a testament to what can happen when this statusquo is challenged.Even Avidyas post refers to Scott as some guy. Not a friend of Mindcrack some guy that isnt helping the business as much as he could. Yes its weird as hell that Im invested in another persons internet friendships and you should probably make fun of me on skype later for it. But look at this thread! Were the hardcore fans and were surprised that we were SOOOO far out of the loop on this.Mindcrack sees itself differently than its hardcore fans do. As such we relate to scotts replies more than the Mindcrackers we see him as one of us in this situation. Thats why this thread is getting so many replies.,MindcrackDiscussion,cmpxj5y,19,t5_2y1ga
2538706,0,t1_cmpxj5y,I totally agree here. Because of the way its always presented even by Guude in his comment response we think of the Mindcrackers and the people who play with them  ESPECIALLY there people who play with them who arent linked by common business   to be friends and its clear Scott felt that way too. To have the knowledge granted to us that the illusion of friendship is just that is kind of worlddestabilizing I think.,MindcrackDiscussion,cmpy0y8,15,t5_2y1ga
2540102,0,t1_cmpic6z,Ah man jeah Ive been eagerly awaiting ugenrikb to host his stuff it game let alone the horse track. BTC his game is a great one too once finished. Heck there are plenty of really fun games to be had in Guudeland with enough people. The only thing that gets played now is The Game.Stuff It alone looks like a game you could have a complete competition table around  teams of  playing a game each sunday for instance.Ads put in a amazing amount of work as well with all these boardgames hes been making with all due respect fun to play not so fun to watch a video with people playing it.The potential with the server and its community is so large thats so frustrating of them not commiting to it. They can create TV series quality comedy if they put their shoulders into it. They could host a  hour Twitch channel with all the content produced they could host a second nonstop channel based on all new Mindcrack Vanilla content if theyd produce  hours of content between the  of them daily. They could take the content to a sattelite and get cable deals with additional editting. Hire script writers to assist in content direction. They could go wild and worldwide beyond the internet and their wildest dreams.Yet it seems a portion of them seems to be content with having had their fun as a guild that exploded in popularity and feeling its time to do other things... Surely with the other guildies as much as possible but on content other then what made them popular in the first place. Most likely causing friction between guys that are wanting to be pro about it and build the success out and others who just felt it iswas a hobby and interests are shifting away from their hobby.,MindcrackDiscussion,cmq4lva,1,t5_2y1ga

2590438,0,t3_2pfvim,A critical part of a multiplayer server is good performance. The big knock against FTB and Crackpack is that overwhelming lag occurs in a relatively short time frame. Poor server performance causes people to not want to play. Lag and frame rate issues are now occurring on the vanilla server. This isnt the main reason the vanilla server is a ghost town but it is a contributing factor imho,MindcrackDiscussion,cmwpgq7,2,t5_2y1ga
2606277,0,t1_cmycxam,Yeah you can.  Democracy can be described as the majority pissing in the cornflakes of the minority. Thats why real democracies have fundamental rights that are not up for a vote.Its necessary to have a real democracy. Even if the  is made of different people each time  still pissing into the cornflakes of the  repeatedly would eventually destroy any democracy. Mindcrack appears to be organized as absolute democracy with no basic rights. The majority which voted for the reset had the choice of just moving to a new area and restarting there.  That would not have affected the minority in any way.They also had to option of forcing a new start on the minority. And thats what they chose.

3584986,1,t1_cq0egb2,Yep. Mindcrack used to be about a community. Etho and the BTeam did massive amounts of work to build that community  and by extension benefited all the server members.Once Mindcrack became about pumping out a minigame video every two hours and all about the money anyone who was there for the community and wanted to work to that end became redundant. ,MindcrackDiscussion,cq0x0e4,5,t5_2y1ga

I understand the feeling that this is an arrangement that wont change anything about the group or how it functions.
