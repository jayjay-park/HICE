7414130,0,t3_3w1u7f,How far apart in age are your dogs and which did you get first? My girlfriend had a male Chihuahua about a month before my dog arrived I had put down a deposit  months in advance of his birth from a great breeder. My two dogs get along great together and never have any aggression towards each other. They even pay tug of war which is pretty funny. It really just boils down to training. I would recommend the leave it  command as I use this anywhere from when he wants to sniff stool to barking at someone at the door. You cannot expect a few sessions with a professional trainer to solve anything. They give you the tools and train you how to do all of the work. Training should be a daily occurrence  to  times a day for  to  minutes to keep them focused and interested. Hope this helps!,CaneCorso,d2kxsbe,1,t5_2utam
