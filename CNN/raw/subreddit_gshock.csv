4684721,0,t1_ctjup81,I would think it was the chlorine. If this is the first time its happened after multiple swimming trips it could have been a mixture of like dead skinsoaplotion...whatever and the pool that caused the reaction and a possible stain. For me I always wash my wrist and watch after I get out of the water just to be safe.,gshock,ctl1z41,3,t5_2r5bq

5343830,0,t1_cvuqbem,If you want the excuse then yes you definitely need m water resistant cold temperature lcd gshock to take a shower. You now how it feels cold when you come out of the shower before you dry normal lcd might crack in those conditions.,gshock,cvuqff2,2,t5_2r5bq

6709349,0,t3_47incm,We are brothers. I just got the negative display version  weeks ago im in love. nObody has mentioned the vibrate its vibrates and is very useful as an alarm. ,gshock,d0dayio,1,t5_2r5bq
7529518,0,t1_d2y2b9p,Very simple and stealthy. I love the look of the BB... Any other suggestions? I heard the lugs on the end were atypical.I already bought the watch cause its exactly what I was looking for in a watch for every day use and more with the Gshock.,gshock,d2y2ijj,1,t5_2r5bq

8040332,0,t1_d4j2e6g,Anything else youd like to know?  I have to say the glide featured modules are probably great for their use surfing and that kind of thing but day to day probably not all that great.  I was using the timer earlier today and in the HT home time mode the timer isnt showing not really surprising.  And in the timer mode nothing else was showing.  In the  module at least the total timer shows in the inset window.  I dont care for that either but at least its something.  I want TOD to be showing while in timer mode like on mudman.However this is extremely viewable.  Much more readable than most of my other squares.,gshock,d4jt4hw,1,t5_2r5bq

9674141,0,t1_da5hx5f,Yours looks like such a nice watch as well might add it to my list. I am wary of the negative display though do you find it a little hard to read? I didnt even think of unboxing videos ill go check them out cheers,gshock,da5jhep,1,t5_2r5bq

10447215,0,t1_dc3qyz9,Check the answer from Casio I must need a new seal We are sorry to hear you are experiencing problems with your watch.  Some condensation fog is acceptable as watches are not a vacuum.  Though watches are water resistant  please note if you are entering and exiting an environment that produces steam hot shower or between areas of extreme hot and cold this will occur. The condensation that should disappear within  to  seconds   if you start having a lot of condensation  takes a long time to dissipate  does not dissipate then you have a repair issue.,gshock,dcsa46u,1,t5_2r5bq
