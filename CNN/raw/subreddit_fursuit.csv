1220812,0,t3_281a84,FlexFoamIT  is fantastic for this application.  Its dense fairly abrasion resistant and forms a nice skin over the surface.  I did a long rambling post on the livejournal about it.  How big are you making these horns?  The  designation means that it weighs  pounds per cubic foot.  For horns of any reasonable size they shouldnt be too heavy.  If they still cause your mask to slide around maybe you need to fix the padding inside your mask.,fursuit,ci6yk3i,1,t5_2t52s
1714202,0,t1_cjv85ak,Thanks weve been trying everything we can as far as mascots go.  We were given the old costume from our high school but there was a reason they got a new one and most of the competitions we go to make a big deal about having good mascot costumes.  As far as travel expenses go were lucky enough to have a sponsor who covers those for us and shameless plugging kindly requesting the assistance of members of the interwebs seemed like a good idea to try.,fursuit,cjv8jx0,1,t5_2t52s

2474549,0,t3_2nw5o4,Ive seen a couple suit builders get fabric with different coloured shorter guard hairs and then shave it in such a way as to produce a scaley look.  Tons of work though and youll only find that fabric available in natural fur colours browns Generally for scalie suits youd just look at using fleece or something nonfur and airbrushing or just ditching the idea of a scale pattern on general.,fursuit,cmhk7fk,1,t5_2t52s

3441177,0,t3_2zn9cw,Just as a little note making your own fursuit may be less expensive than most commissions but it definitely isnt cheap. Youll be shelling out cash for fur foam glue other fabrics electric clippers tape etc. It can really add up. Id go through the tutorials youve found and prepare a estimated materials budget so you can get an idea of what youll be spending.As for head foam high density upholstery foam is typical. The thickness depends on the method and can range from . to  even on the same head.,fursuit,cpkiqa5,2,t5_2t52s
3514543,0,t1_cprlvja,Haha shes great. I remember a few years back I ran in to her at an anime convention she loved my suit and she was wearing her first made costume a wolf from Princess Mononoke I told her about fursuits where to go for howtos and critique the Fur suit LJ and weve been friends ever since. Its amazing how far shes come so fast. Leaps and bounds ahead of me in construction and skill just a wonderful artist and nice person. ,fursuit,cpsvtdt,1,t5_2t52s

3933843,0,t3_35if2x,At the very least you could go in the fursuit parade.  Because all you have to worry about is following the person directly in front of you you dont need a handler. I find I can manage fairly well fursuiting solo even with crummy vision just means I get my tail stuck in doors and occasionally thwack people with it.  Nobody seems to mind  P,fursuit,cr4oysy,8,t5_2t52s
4088858,0,t1_crm94az,This sign is still a terrible way to get the message across as it contains no information as to why you shouldnt do these things or what kind of touching is ok and what isnt. Its just any physical contact  bad.A sign with a short summary of the main points of the how to handle fursuiters panel might be useful. ,fursuit,crmcs12,10,t5_2t52s

10513437,0,t3_5q7tnu,Should cost more. Undercharging is asking for problems with followthru.  for a partial without feetpaws? Including head tail handpaws and arm sleeves? Too low... I would say a good quality partial with feetpaws is worth  depending on details.,fursuit,dczt6gm,1,t5_2t52s

11599759,0,t3_643owo,wait i can actually answer this.I completed my dragon costume made primarily from aluminum scales about a week ago I put it over in rdragons if you want to see or just ask me i can send the link again.What I ended up doing was ditching the actual mail part of scale mail and sewed on the scales to a stretch leather fabric instead. This allows the costume to be skintight while also avoiding the weight of rings which are as heavy or heavier than the scales themselves. The disadvantage is that sewing takes literally forever I did this over . years with  hours just for sewing scales and the scales can come loose if they cut into each other too much. I havent lost a scale yet due to how I attached them at two points instead of one but I expect to lose a few when I actually take it somewhere.The weight isnt too bad actually. The entire thing with hands head feet tail is  scales which weigh approximately lb but when spread across my body I hardly notice and its actually kinda comfortable? If you were to do this with rings instead youd be looking at lb.Heat is a problem but I mean it is in every suit so thats fairly well documented. I expect to have some problems in direct sunlight so well see how that goes...Im happy to answer more questions about how I did things and if youre really set on doing something like this how to avoid some of the problems I ran in to.,fursuit,dgauat2,2,t5_2t52s
