2815423,0,t3_2l5yj1,Ive been plugging away at a crappy little adventure game framework in Python for a while now. The parser is definitely the trickiest part. There is a lot to take into account.Anyway I thought about this problem as well  as Im sure anyone trying to write some sort of parser has  and I made some notes. Included is a list of all of the possible reasonable command structures that I could think of. Or at least that I was willing to try to get working. Maybe youll find it useful.Here it is copiedpasted  hopefully it makes some sense to someone other than myself    Command Structures        Key          a  Article      A  Adverb      N  Nounnoun phrase      P  Preposition      V  Verb    Position Possibilities            V        a A N P        a A N P        a A N P        a P N        a N        N    Length Possibilities            V        VN        VaN VPN VNA VAN        VPaN VaNA VAaN VNPN        VaNPN VNPaN VPNPN        VaNPaN VPaNPN VPNPaN VAaNPN VANPaN        VPaNPaN VAaNPaN    Possible Structures          V      ltverbgt        look      VN      VaN      ltverbgt ltnoungt      ltverbgt article ltnoungt        get lamp        get the lamp      VPN      VPaN      ltverbgt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt        get in the box        look through the telescope        jump on the trampoline      VNA      VaNA      ltverbgt ltnoungt ltadverbgt      ltverbgt article ltnoungt ltadverbgt        turn the lamp off        push the switch right        turn the dial west      VAN      VAaN      ltverbgt ltadverbgt ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltadverbgt article ltnoungt        turn off the lamp        put on the boots      VNPN      VaNPN      VNPaN      VaNPaN      ltverbgt ltnoungt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt      ltverbgt article ltnoungt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltnoungt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt      ltverbgt article ltnoungt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt        use the sword on the troll        put a coin in the slot        take the candy from the baby      VPNPN      VPaNPN      VPNPaN      VPaNPaN      ltverbgt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt        look at the bug with the magnifying glass      VANPN      VAaNPN      VANPaN      VAaNPaN      ltverbgt ltadverbgt ltnoungt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltadverbgt article ltnoungt ltprepositiongt ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltadverbgt ltnoungt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt      ltverbgt ltadverbgt article ltnoungt ltprepositiongt article ltnoungt        turn off the valve with the wrench      ? ltverbgt article ltplural noungt        get the coins      ? ltverbgt number ltplural noungt        get  coins    The reason the last two have a question mark in front of them is because I wasnt sure ifhow I wanted to tackle them. Plural nounsquantifiers are a bit trickier.I figured that with just those combinations there would be more than enough possibilities for interesting interactionspuzzles. I am not trying to compete with the parsers of Inform or TADS or anything. Anyone seriously wanting to write an adventure game wouldshould just use one of those systems instead. I am writing my framework just for funeducation. Basically instead of playing an adventure game Im making one from scratch. That is just as fun if not more so for me.,interactivefiction,cno3u03,2,t5_2qyx9
4624481,0,t1_ctckdej,Stats are used in a very similar way in some Japanese visual novels particularly in the dating sim genre and it works very well.  Its common to have a feeling score for each of the heroines and use the highest or highest two in some cases to determine which route you end up on.  I think that it works particularly well in that case because youre comparing scores to each other rather than arbitrary thresholds.Regarding branching diagrams I think that as long as you extend them to allow branching based on state as well as the players current choice they continue to be a useful model.  The other core insight is that complex nodes can be broken down into multiple simpler nodes that are either simple conditionals branch points or always do the same thing.  You dont have to actually write the game like that but its a useful language for discussing how complex nodes are.,interactivefiction,ctdhmnv,1,t5_2qyx9

7470622,0,t1_d2rasbc,I think you can also use the recently opensourced Ink in Unity! A quick google brings up this git repository gt  Havent tried it but it might work!Of course if youre going to use Unity you might also look into other free CYOA plugins such as the wonderful Fungus www.fungusgames.com.,interactivefiction,d2rd4r8,3,t5_2qyx9

8726368,0,t1_d40s52g,Here goes something finish the Android app pronto.Another thing give people the ability to work offline and download works to read offline without reading the app. Call them spoolsthey dont update unless youre online but you can read the version youve got.Good tools for tagging games including listing by words choice complexity hours of play estimated and genres. If you want a good example for a great taggingwarning system check out Archive Of Our Own. Google it and I am sorry for the hours you will wasteOne thing I think will be useful is a tag or page system for how actively developed a story is. For example having a tp for inprogress apps. Call it Construction Zone so those developing their stories can have good feedback. Having some sort of way for content creators and readers as well as the good moderation tools to deal with the inevitable snags would be a must. If a story hasnt been updated in a year and isnt marked as completed you could autoflag a story with a tag Boneyard for abandoned stories. Could call the completed IF section Theater of Forks or something.One thing you could do too is a reputation system for helpful comments and quality stories. Above a certain reputation they can start add to and collaborate on say Quest Adventuresif thats an IF people can write further on collaboratively or where people vote on answers for the writers to work on next or submit answers.One thing I do absolutely advise at least considering is a adult filter. People are going to go there eventually. Best to have that sort of thing sooner rather than later.,interactivefiction,d6wfsk9,1,t5_2qyx9
9155759,0,t3_55phyp,The best I use is Son of Hunky Punk despite the horrible name.  You might also want to check out TextFiction it opts for a chatlike interface that may or may not work great.They both support zcode but not glulx.  Hunky Punk also supports TADS many classics there.hopefully one day the web vms written in javascript will work flawlessly in mobile browsers.  At least they got zcode and glulx covered but that works really best on desktop,interactivefiction,d8ck4ew,6,t5_2qyx9
