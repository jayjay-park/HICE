His healing isnt really anymore extensive than any other apostles.In either case the Count slug apostle was the first major apostle we see Guts Fight right at the beginning in the Black Swordsman Arc. guts has come a long way since then.In either case Im not saying Guts could kill him easily under normal circumstances just that the armour puts him far beyond his normal capabilities. He was already superhuman before donning the armour this just boosts that even more.In either case yes the Skull knight has been fighting Zodd for years and yet in every fight weve witnesses Zodd hasnt harmed him at all. the Skul knight has delt plenty of injuries I assume they simply maintain their mutual respect for one another. Anyway The Skull knight doesnt have the armour anymore and hes just a shell of himself.Ive heard that Griffith chose him to be his right hand man because firstly hes the one apostle he knew the most. And secondly he took the role of Guts.Its no secret that Guts and Zodd reflect one another in many ways weapons fighting style mentality they even look similar. Zodd is to the Neoband of the Hawk as Guts was to the original.The other apostles clearly respect Zodd but they dont fear him.

2007750,0,t3_2hqmzt,The second eclipse really wasnt an eclipse as much as it was a variation of it or something quite the opposite of it in some way.  Where as with the first eclipse was a summoning of the god hand to create a member from man the second eclipse or the Incarnation Ceremony as its officially called summons the god hand to create a man from one of their members because of the separate realms they reside in hence the involvement of the BehelitShaped Apostle.Femto and Griffith are the same person and can switch between one another at will.  Because of the Incarnation Ceremony it can be speculated that Femto was absent from the God Hand at that time although this is no longer the case ever since the World Tranformation that brought the God Hand to the real world.  Zodd sticks around with Griffith out of respect for the man and because of the fact that he is a physical incarnation of the God Hand.  Ever since Griffiths return to the physical world he has shown a resounding supernatural charisma almost to the point of hypnotism but whether this is the reason for the members of the current Band of the Hawk or simply being there out of respect for the man that singlehandedly saved Midland from the wrath of a giant fuckall Persian wannabe godtree with tentacles the diameter of Liza Lampanellis snatch is still yet to be known although its clearly not affecting Rickert and his balls of tungstenspoiler.,Berserk,ckv4qnu,12,t5_2rru6

2282904,0,t1_cltv7qd,right... but it does allow them to change their fate to some degree... they generally are given the choice to Live while cutting away their humanity or die. this would indicate that the power to choose ones fate is either powered by the possession of a behelit or exists regardless of being chosen by the behelit or not.  when arguing destiny or fate its really hard to prove it one way or another especially in this series. we have one known incident where the user of a behelit chose to die. was that his fate to die after his second summoning? or did he deny fate and choose death ? if you think about behelits being the device that which allows people to choose their fate and not just an instrument which summons the godhand then alot starts to make sense. Griffith was able to see his fate had he not chosen to sacrifice everyone during the eclipse if you think about it this way griffith was being shown the two possible paths before him a short Life of despair existing as a helpless creature for all of his days or becoming a ruler of everything.... ,Berserk,cltvuh4,1,t5_2rru6

I admit that the excessive light barring in the funi broadcast versions does detract but Im not sure if Funi or the original japanese broadcast is to blame on that point.Even so as a counterpoint Kiseijuu is is both violent and graphic and while a good portion of the gorier bits are thrown off camera it shows enough to convey the point. To be absolutely frank I dont see why bloodgore is necessary in an extremely graphic nature to faithfully convey berserk past the golden age arc. Naturally I wouldnt want Naruto or other shounen level toning down but you can certainly find a middle ground that doesnt result in a show that is barely watchable for the blackwhite covering the screen.,Berserk,cm0xa78,1,t5_2rru6

2366575,0,t3_2mgnr9,Dude thank you so much for doing this. Ill definitely follow along with you as you play the game. Possible to post a playlist link for the series?BTW loved the mind fuck. I think it hits home because I can see it as being entirely plausible that the band of the hawk supports griffith after the sacrifice. Its like what if after their deaths they were clued into a huge part of the missing puzzle. Yeah they fought for their lives but they were ignorant in life. After seeing Griffiths true plans in the afterlife they realized that their deaths were necessary to fulfill the dreams of their beloved leader. Dreams that they were willing to lay their lives down for in the first place. Now where does this leave Guts?  A wrench in the spokes stopping the creation of Griffiths utopic new world or the only hero who can stop him from creating a dictatorial and demonic hell on earth? Great stuff!Edit Miura is credited as a writer on IMDB although its unclear to me whether he is credited as the writer of the manga the games based off of or the actual writer of the games story.

He has a full time job and probably other commitments so the time he gets to actually draw Berserk it limited. And not to mention all the prep work to draft the drawings and typesetting. Last I heard he is releasing the next issue in March. Also you read the whole manga in two weeks in October? Did you have a vacation?

Even though Guts has the Berserker armor hes still not invincible. While Guts has had much more battle experience than Femto or even human Griffith Id still say that Femto is worlds beyond Guts due to his power as a God Hand. Besides Guts doesnt seem to have improved that much after defeating the Count except for gaining some new armor. In fact due to recent events hes probably worse off his scars keep accumulating his mental health isnt getting any better and he lost a significant amount of weight due to his illness after fighting Ganishka. Im sure that Miura has something up his sleeve however I will say that in his current state Guts has no chance against Femto though he can probably do a bit of damage.,Berserk,conwrdx,2,t5_2rru6

3406519,0,t1_cpgb12l,I think  is probably unlikely but its the conclusion most are going to jump to considering how much Griffith talked about Guts distracting him from his dream. The dynamic between them is one of the more interesting things in the series. Possible but I dont see much evidence for this.  He looked at his hand both times. Also if its a power failure why insert shots of him focusing on Guts. It seems weak narrative to introduce the big bad and then make his powers malfunction right away.  Hate it or not this is where my money is. As A God Hand he could see the strings of causality and recognized that they had a part to play in the Age of Darkness.

3951960,0,t3_35q8w7,Okay so the part you are referring to is in Volume . The line is Jill Attacking and eating humans is what wolves do too. Maybe thats what you do when you are not human.Puck Wolves dont do that except in special situations. and hey... everyone here use to be...Jill is using wolves as an example of people getting killed to argue that it may just be natural for animals to kill humans. Puck is refuting that despite what media tends to portray wolves and other dangerous animals will usually rather run than attack people. The everyone here use to be... line is referring back to the elf apostles meaning that they are not a part of nature in fact they use to be human. Later on when they are playing war Puck completes his thought with Only humans can enjoy killin like that. Berserk as a whole is about evil that humans create so the line here is meant to underline that idea that what Rosine and her elves are doing is not natural but a twisted human Idea of nature.You kinda misread it but thats OK!

4572885,0,t1_ct64qvc,I would say the problem with most writing isnt that it relies on tropes Berserk itself makes heavy uses of a lot of already very prominent and common tropes in fiction. Using a specific trope in writing is never a problem in and of itself its more about making your characters interesting which is what Berserk does that separates itself from the pack.Ill give an example a major aspect of Berserk is Guts trying to save Casca. Its used over and over again in various ways and it basically boils down to the common trope of the hero saving the princess that you see in so much fiction. The difference with Berserk is that Guts isnt just The Hero and Casca isnt just The Princess theyre both interesting and unique characters with their own motivations and reasons for acting. Whats even more in the act of saving or being saved each character actually has their characterization and personality change as a response to their actions and the actions surrounding them during the saving. Thats what makes for good writing.,Berserk,ct70smb,1,t5_2rru6

I dont claim to know what Miuras end game is for Guts vs Griffith but it almost feels too Shounen for it to come down to the party fighting the God Hand with the equivalent of super powers. The story does already have plenty of themes to support said super power battle already but something about it just doesnt seem right to me. I feel like Miura things will take a different turn. Only time will tell though. And if your theory proves right or something similar then I cant say it wouldnt be cool as hell. ,Berserk,ctbusfz,2,t5_2rru6

4746739,0,t1_ctrlxir,No offense taken though you do misrepresent my views a bit. Particularly while badass makes for some fun comics I do not believe it is the lifeblood of Berserk andGuts body count at the end of the series is among the least of my concerns. Whats far more important to me is that the work is true to its theme. And thus far Berserk has been fantastic in its uncompromising view of the struggle to survive and find meaning at the world often at terrible and horrific cost. Berserkclearly harkens to the traditions of Lovecrafts horror fiction and the brutal realism of the darkest Sword and Sorcery stories and what makes it truly special is that it pulls no punches and has followed those ideas as ascetically and violently and it possibly can.While Cascas fate could certainly go a million different ways I would be shocked to see Guts retire his sword at then end of the manga and decide its time to settle down and start a family. Far more likely he dies with his sword in the hand on the battlefield where he was born. While I wouldnt take an authors opinion on his unwritten ending to stringently at this point chances are much better that bitter sweet means that Berserk finds some kind of peace or resolution to his endless fighting somewhere at the edge of his life and the end of the sane world. An ending like this certainly would be more powerful and reflect the struggle of the manga more then Guts and Casca walking into the sunset on their way to getting old and tired while raising kids named after The Band of the Hawk and just kind of wiping away that Guts is a mass murderer and they both once looked on the edge of their worlds existence. Put another way happy endings are cheap moreso when the entire work has never failed to emphasis fatalism the violent murder of hundreds of people and a literal God of Evil pulling the strings of destiny. Every drop of ink spared to see Guts put Judeao II to bed while the Dragon Slayer gets cobwebs in the closet and Casca smiles while sowing doilies would feel a cheap lie in the face of the rest of the manga. Guts has walked through caused and bathed in too much blood anddarkness to make walking away a real option. Meeting this fate with a sword in his hand and his soul at rest is more of a victory then dying in a bed will ever be.Regarding the point of Casca specifically I certainly think shell come back in one way or another. I sincerely doubt the Elf King will just wave his hands and tellthemthey wasted their time coming here. But stay back in such a way that Gutsand Casca can get back to flirting in combat and fighting back to back? I doubt it.As I said more likely she goes as the story has already hinted and finds that whatever sanity she has left is better spent as a mother tothe Moon Child thanmarching against Griffith or reestablishing a relationship with Guts leaving her to follow the probably herotherworldly offspringinto a place where Guts and Co cannot follow. Of course all roads lead to Falconia and what awaits all the characters there I have no idea.,Berserk,ctsvdrh,1,t5_2rru6

5300840,0,t3_3nb5vm,To echo what has been said by others it doesnt appear Griffith needed some kind of rebound sex to make him feel better. It goes much deeper than that. Its always been my interpretation that Guts beating Griffith in their duel sent Griffith spiraling out of control. He was suddenly bested by his greatest tool in front of all his other subordinates. Sleeping with Charlotte was simply a power play to regain a semblance of control over what he perceived to be losing the tools to achieving his dream.

5463267,0,t3_3pv17k,I think they work great as a way to introduce people to Berserk. I know a lot of people on this sub hate the movies... But its an interesting parallel that most of the posts in favor of the movies are people who havent read the manga.So yeah the movies arent as good as the manga or the original anime but like I said I think they work well as an introduction. They arent as dated as the original anime and the voice acting is a lot less stiff. And everything that the movies are missing will not be seen by someone who hasnt read the manga. Plus its a lot less of a commitment to someone who is unsure about whether they want to try the series or not. ,Berserk,cw9zfep,3,t5_2rru6
5464506,0,t3_3pv17k,Im new to Berserk. I watched the first movie on a Netflix recommendation. Then I sought out the second two movies. I thought they were okay overall. I havent read the manga deep outside of the recent issues so Im totally not looking at it from that perspective. As a trilogy of movies theyre okay. I figure if you have read the manga then theyre terrible. ,Berserk,cwa54vg,2,t5_2rru6
5469236,0,t3_3py7de,I love to hate Mozgus hes a great character.  However I disagree about his inquisition not being baseless.  He has been on this heretic hunt for a good while now.  When we first meet him he apparently burned a whole town of women and children.  I get the feeling that he just happened to stumble into these legitimate heretics for once.  If they were not there I am sure he would find a reason to kill some people.  Like they said even a mole would be enough to mark you are a heretic.  Then there are also those that die from torture even before being found guilty of heresy.  Hes a pretty big creep who believes hes doing the right thing.Over all the Conviction Arc is one of my favorite parts of the series.

5687522,0,t3_3t0dv2,I dont think they ever stopped. I think people seem to believe that in paper friendship is supposed to be friendly and nothing but which really is quite untrue even in real life. Both Guts and Griffith learned a lot more about themselves after the Eclipse and as Griffith said no one knows him better than Guts and I would say the same for Guts  not even Casca knows him that well. And seeing as how these are both strongwilled characters some friction yeah understatement was bound to happen. Just think of Guts quest for revenge from Guardians of Desire to where we are now in the Elf Island Chapter. Guts has matured so much come to terms with his past life with Gambino learning to tame his rage and seeing beyond Kill and Destroy but he still knows deep down that Griffiths memory is there with him and Miura has a way of referencing destiny imo as if sooner or later they will cross paths again as they have thrice now after the Eclipse. What I mean to say is we humans can get easily distracted from our goals our missions yet Guts wants to see his story with Griffith  through to the end. Do you guys ever care that much about an enemy? I can think of all the people that I hate or have hated and just remember how life has a way to distract me from that make me see a different way. ,Berserk,cx23c15,1,t5_2rru6

5700259,0,t3_3t575y,Manga  at first then  in the following years were I read some others pretty good mangas and while my berserk flame kind of dimmed a little due to the ever increasing hiatus. Then  again after I rereading.Movies . at first because my gleeful childlike eyes made me ignore most negative points while I basked in SOMETHING berserk being released. Then I soiled my memories rewatching and sipping on online cynicism and it fell to .Roguelike  very tight metagaming. Perfect in its objective of being what it had set up to be in first place. You know a well rounded game that stopped exactly were it should and you just enjoy it instead of imagining what if it had X what if it didnt have Y. Not the first time its developer delivers something of the kind. His DiabloRL also fits the description.PS Game  but I recognize that my low expectative greatly improved my experience with it. I should note that I played it intermittently and without a feeling of rush so that could explain why the usually cited repetitiveness of it didnt hit me that much. I can understand why people who binge played found it to be tiring. Still as you can by my rating I liked it.Anime . again I had so low expectations that I only watched it after had tried everything else cited here. Only years after having first read the manga. I thought I wouldnt ever see it since its obviously way bellow the manga. Yeah it IS bellow the manga but it ended up being an amazing journey on its on. This rating is also probably influenced by my newfound love for sscell animation after I set up a huge old CRT TV and PS to both play and watch some oldies. And damn I loved it so much. Even the lack of background music in a lot of scenes gave it a special feel. Only doesnt hit the  for me because of some minor things Im too tired to type about now.,Berserk,cx3o7rt,1,t5_2rru6

6005906,0,t3_3xqd8c,I think it wouldnt kill you to watch them since youve come this far and you might even get something out of it. Its true that they did a poor job of developing the characters and keeping the important parts of the plotin some cases their changes were really bad for the storyand the CG is distracting when its overused. Some people including many of our most respected members just absolutely hate the movies and see no reason to watch them. They have legitimate reasons I agree with most of their criticisms. I cant guarantee that you will find something to like about them but for the chance that you might its worth a shot.While I didnt think the movies were good on the whole Im glad I watched them for the aspects I liked. There were some specific scenes I thought they actually did a really good job with and they put a lot of detail into depicting the costumes military equipment and scenery. Theyve got a good soundtrack. Of course the movies cannot begin to compare with the manga in any way and the anime was a much more faithful adaptation but for all their flaws I think the movies contain a few hidden gems.

6017698,0,t3_3xtc02,Im going say that its not likely at least not for a long time. It can take years for that kind of stuff to finally get released in North America. If anything Viz Media who Im assuming will be chosen as the publisher again will prioritize the upcoming adaptation over a Bluray release of a show that originally aired in . Perhaps once the new adaptation comes out and is successful enough and gets published in NA then they might turn to the Bluray version of the original TV series to see if they can get it as well.In all honesty all I did was just torrent some bluray rips that also had the English audio. Even though theyre rips they still look way better compared to the remastered DVD release. Importing the Japanese bluray set is simply impractical because its so damn expensive and it doesnt have the English audio the show has a very good English dub plus I honestly despise the box art they used for it. Gutss face just looks goofy. However I wouldnt torrent it if I didnt own the DVD boxset already. You could try and find the remastered DVD release for a decent price but it will run you at least  if youre lucky.

6258146,0,t1_cz0wwzl,gt Im super curious into how the child will come into play in the future of the seriesOne of the most commonly speculated points is that since the fetus was used as a vessel for Griffiths incarnation the two share a body in a sense. Griffith may even have some lingering feelings for Casca and Guts due to the childs feelings for its parents. Theres a possibility that the child is the key to destroying Griffith or at least destroying his human form. If thats the case we may be looking at a situation where Guts needs to decide if hes going to kill his own son to exact revenge on Griffith. This would get even more complicated if Casca regained her sanity and became involved in the matter. Its an interesting theory but it is still only speculation. Well see how it all winds up playing out eventually. ,Berserk,cz0zduj,8,t5_2rru6

Even if he never overtly acts in defiance to the God Hand like Ganishka did I could easily see him decide to not take action in some future situation where he could stop or delay Guts and Co.  Zodd doesnt seem to really care about the machinations of the God Hand or the fate of humanity and will simply do battle for the sake of doing battle.  Grunbeld and Locus are soldiers for the God Hand throughinthrough and seem to do whatever is asked of them.  Rakshas appears to have his own agenda in all this but still largely seems to work in parallel to the desires of the God Hand even if he isnt on the same path.,Berserk,cz2fi14,7,t5_2rru6

7299352,0,t1_d26xlc7,gt Instead of just disagreeing ... youve said refutes this. Except that I did demonstrate Pucks value. I explained how Puck acts to further develop Guts character. The Skull Knight is necessary to the story at large and plays a huge role in saving Guts from the eclipse. He is not exactly a minor role. Just because these characters do not play a central role during the Golden Age does not mean that they are unworthy of being included. As I have repeatedly stated which you have utterly ignored as you have much of what Ive said the story of Berserk goes well beyond the bounds of the Golden Age. Their lack of inclusion is detrimental to the story at large and only serves to demonstrate the failings of the anime. You say I need to explain how they add to the focus of the anime but the animes focus is inferior shallower! These changes may have been necessary to fit the animated format but that does not mean that they are for the better and it does not mean that an anime which is limited by its production can match up to the manga which as I have already stated has no such limits. You claim that the importance of Guts is something to be respected but the Skull Knight does exist and as much as you would like for Guts to be more important reality needs to sink in at some point. The Skull Knight seems to have faced a similar trial to Guts and you think this to be unimportant? This information radically transforms the understanding of the series.gt Again you need to work ... developed in the Golden Age arc.That bit of advisement from someone who cannot understand my stance on the anime is unwelcome and rightfully discarded. I have repeatedly referred to the anime as an inferior alternative and so I have no reason to limit my scope of events to the just the Golden Age arc.gt Comedy like in the anime ... youve yet to refute.Ive already made my defense of Puck. His primary purpose is not as a comic relief character despite your assertions. And once again your lack of comprehension is astounding there is nothing wrong with humor in a dark story. And do you know who sets the tone of Berserk? Miura. If Miura decides that Berserk should have some lighter notes to go along with the darkness then that become canon. Im not sure if youre aware that your personal headcanon is not actually the standard by which everyone else measures this series but even Puck and Isidros interactions contribute to the overall tone of Berserk. If this does not conform to your wishes then fucking deal with it.gt You clearly do have ... obtuse to realize this.Please I invite you to demonstrate your claim. From where Im standing it seems the other way around my dear chap.And youre still wrong because  ... for appreciation.Im not saying your enjoyment is not genuine. Just inferior if you limit yourself to the anime. Have you read the manga? Yes? Well congratulations you can enjoy it to your hearts contentment. Do you enjoy the anime more? Yes? Well then I disagree with you about its relative quality. Thats it.gt Also your Shakespeare example ... just like Shakespeare did in his plays. THIS IS AMAZING. Im going to screenshot this. SO I assume you think you could improve on Shakespeare now? Thats right just remove all of those pedestrian comedy bits and voila you have a masterpiece! Your arrogance is legendary I assure you. For your information Shakespeares work had both lowbrow and highbrow humor. Not all of it pandered to the groundlings Plenty of dirty jokes but not solely dirty jokes. Although I suppose a greater intellect of your dizzying caliber has no time for something as petty as jokes.The DunningKruger ... to Shakespeare.Youve substantiated nothing to a degree which I consider worthy. Youre either disingenuous or in someway hindered mentally. Except when I mentioned those devices my topic was your criticism of the way the Manga gives away too much information. I rightly defended the way the manga begins by pointing at several established tropes in fiction all of which Berserk employs. Are you even trying at this point?gt You seem to be stuck on the word real ... arrogant and ignorant. Except it literally does. Words exist for a reason. From dictionary.com Real genuine not counterfeit artificial or imitation authentic. The manga is the realest way to enjoy Berserk and far superior in terms of depth. You cannot claim that the anime is the realest way to enjoy Berserk and be correct because it is literally not. The anime not only removes or ignores portions of the story but is limited in its setup for the rest of the story.gt Oh HEY now youre ... its clearly your limited mental capacity. The difference between us is that I have some intellectual honesty. Ive made plenty of valid points which you have not bothered to address and have completely ignored. Whereas when I am proven careless or wrong in some way I acknowledge it. I assume it has something to do with maturity.gt I am fully aware of how wrong youve been and how youve tried to curb your statements throughout this conversation. Im just correcting your timeline.Ive been utterly upfront about fixing my mistakes. I wish you would pay some of the same considerations. But my mistakes tend to be more along the lines of carelessness and yours tend to be on more on the huge monumental oh god how could I have been wrong all along vein.gt I dont think you know what irrelevant ... claim about the entirety of the manga. So you ARE making the point that quality cannot be assessed before completion? Really? So how are you even participating in this conversation? For all you know the Berserk manga could become the greatest conceivable work of fiction! This little argument youve made doesnt just work in one direction. So if this is your genuine opinion how can you claim to think the anime is better? After all the quality of the manga is a totally unknown factor before its conclusion. Arguments of this freakishly poor quality should perhaps hint at how weak your position is. Perhaps you are participating in this conversation because as long as the criticism is towards the manga you feel safe comparing it the the anime but as soon as the criticism falls on the anime you suddenly say that it cannot be compared to the manga because it is not yet complete.gt Youre the one on a different ... has his own determination and purpose.Right and at the end of the anime you are left at the beginning of the anime. Has Griffith gotten his comeuppance? No? Then the story of Guts is not finished just like the Manga. Just because you can slice a chunk out of a story does not make that chunk stand on its own.gt This story focus also parallels ... transcending his fate. Ok.gt The anime does have a climax and ... through his relationship with Griffith. I know the anime is based on the Golden Age and like all Arcs in Berserk there are basic elements of plot within. There is indeed a climax within the Golden Age arc in the form of the Eclipse. There is resolution in that we discover the process by which Guts becomes the Black Swordsman. But this does not a complete story make. All of Guts goals still lie before him there is more to the story.gt Im not the one who needs ... support the DunningKruger effect accusation.

7359513,0,t1_d2efo5z,I for one think that Dave has a point there. It just depends on what you mean by good guy. When we talk about The Good Guys in a movie or comic book we usually just mean the side were supposed to root for. Even bad people can be seen as antiheroes as long as the Bad Guys theyre fighting are even worse and as long as the antiheroes dont cross a certain line such as murdering innocent people. The Band of the Hawk isnt composed of people who are fighting to free Midland from Tudors oppression theyre fighting for Griffiths dream in the hope that their own dreams will be fulfilled in the process. In terms of morality theyre pretty much neutral and they would be seen as bad guys or evil by the people of Midland if they were fighting for Tudor instead. The mere fact that they fight for Midland and arent completely reprehensible human beings is enough to make them heroes. Boscogn the way I see it is defined more by being lawful than being evil. He is evil insofar as he obeys evil masters and doesnt simply up and leave although realistically he couldnt do that without being punished for treason. Hes fighting for the side that started the war through aggression and is willing to kill in the name of that bad cause but its not necessarily because he likes it. Boscogn fights out of his sense of duty and since his superiors have already sent the army into war he would rather kill Midlands soldiers than let them kill his own men who are personally no more responsible for their masters evil than their enemies are. He just thinks my country right or wrong which a sizable proportion of people think is a patriotic attitude. Lots of people in wars enlist even if they disagree with their countrys policy simply because they dont want to let their own friends and neighbors get killed by the enemy. In that sense Boscogn is probably more patriotic than Guts or Griffith who are fighting primarily for their own selfinterest and loyalty to their personal friends. Boscogn thinks that Gennons habit of molesting young boys is wrong or at least disgusting and he doesnt have any evil personal habits like that as far as we know. In fact he has an admirable sense of personal responsibility as we saw when he berated Adon for getting a hundred of his own men killed for personal revenge and yet having the gall to escape with his own life. If Boscogns loyalty was to Midland instead of Tudor then he would justifiably be considered a hero because his loyalty and sacrifice would be in the service of a good cause rather than a bad one.,Berserk,d2eq5lc,2,t5_2rru6

Pseudomorphic has a translation in Japanese  while High Electron Mobility Transistor looks something like  so together  and in every instance that I can find of the these words being put together and shortened to acronym form it is shown as HEMT.The katakana for femto again  does not appear in any article or relation to HEMT that I can find.,Berserk,d3intz1,1,t5_2rru6

In the manga Isidro is not at any point in a forest until the trolls part after Conviction arc. Isidro and Guts meet in the village under Kushan attack and then run through fields to the tower.This makes me worried that they might be skipping Lost Children arc entirely and introducing Isidro already in that skeleton fight that happens in the forest after Koka castles Snake apostle.

When both the east and west can enjoy anime like a normal tv show ideas like recreating a fully faithful adpation of Berserk may become a high budget investment. For now we get what we are given I suppose. While the new series looks troubling at some points it looks okay in others.

8025688,0,t3_4p50xt,I feel you. A Musou wouldnt really work well to represent the tone of Berserk or any of the characters except in the absolute broadest strokes. First and foremost the stakes in a Musou game are incredibly low no losing resources like a Souls game or getting an undesirable narrative outcome like The Witcher. A Berserk game really wants some kind of penalty for poor performance because the world Guts inhabits is this sort of raw and nihilistic place hiding behind a thin veneer of civilisation  before and after the Eclipse. In terms of characters and combat? Given that Guts is our central character lets think of it on his terms. Guts is an ex mercenary with his fighting style making him essentially a knight in all but title. On top of that though Guts has a character tendency to allow his visceral fears to flow in combat. He mixes savagery with martial knowledge and efficient sword technique as much a tactician as the berserker the title refers to. In a Musou where standard enemies are mostly passive targets theres no particular call to consider strategy deeply. Additionally difficulty in a Musou usually consists of optional pursuit of side objectives or some kind of pressure factor that pushes players down a single linear path despite the maps being superficially open in this case. I guess the Souls games are the closest were getting to a true Berserk game for some time to come. I say true here because they make a spirited and largely successful attempt at addressing the themes and tone of Berserk plus definite aesthetic reference to it. The way Souls games make you fight hard for every stretch of terrain optimising the position and timing of your attacks in relation to the map geometry really sells the desperation of Berserks violence  even for individuals like Guts whose abilities are superhuman in some respects. ,Berserk,d4i5v6p,1,t5_2rru6

8146936,0,t1_d4vvec2,Yeah I understand both the legal and moral or ethical elements but it is an unfortunate mitigation of Berserk as it is in its original best form the manga of course. The Arc isnt even truly necessary to the main plotline either after all besides Gutss beast manifesting in the aftermath of it anyway so I do understand why something so potentially controversial would be cut but its still one of my favorite arcs very poignant and dark so its a big shame regardless for me.

8161408,0,t3_4qptkx,I feel Ill get downvoted to hell and back for this but I actually loved this episode. While I was expecting handdrawn animation and not the Golden Age movie animation I felt it worked fine due to already appreciating it from the Golden Age movies. On top of that I was never a fan of the Lost Children arc or the Black Swordsman arcthough I did like Black Swordsman much more than Lost Children. For the purposes of the manga they work just fine but for the purpose of anime I feel those arcs would plod along just a little too much. The Conviction arc sounds like a fair place to start with all that being said.I did have one issue and that was lacking an explanation to how Guts got the Dragonslayer. Thatll probably be resolved through a flashback.Maybe Im insane maybe Im not. Dont really care. Thisll be a good season I think and Im excited to see one of my favorite series adapted into popcorndevouring fun time.P.S RIP karma,Berserk,d4xq2mb,3,t5_2rru6
8162161,0,t1_d4xqfdq,The sound design in general actually put me off the new show more than even the animation. At a glance the metal score seems to fit with the theme. Badass black swordsman fighting monsters from nightmare. Lots of exciting  high tempo tracks to compliment a fast paced rout of a fight. My problem there is that thats just not the impression Ive ever gotten from a fight from Berserk. The fights arent parties. Theyre struggles. Sad painful lifethreatening struggles that leave the participants a little more hollow after each and every one. I never feel like a fight in Berserk is something to get pumped up about. Theyre fights for survival with all the weight that goes with that especially after the Eclipse. ,Berserk,d4xtgii,12,t5_2rru6

8166513,0,t3_4r155i,I do agree that Griffith was always quite manipulative and even egocentric at times but in my interpretation of his character I think he did actually care for his comrades before everything happened.gt Griffith literally sent his best friends to be eaten tortured and slaughtered by demons because his dream was at stake which no sane person can say is an okay choice.Yes no doubt thats not an okay choice but if I remember correctly Griffith was not exactly sane either when he made that choice his pride and ego had been shattered when he failed to prevent Guts from leaving the Band of the Hawk and in turn that made him depressed to the point of doing something as reckless as sleeping with Princess Charlotte maybe to feel he still had power or control but we later see that it only made him feel worse. After that he is found out and arrested being tortured for a WHOLE year I dont think its too much of a stretch at all to think that Griffith might have became at least a little mentally damaged from that yearlong experience.Later even before the eclipse he tries to cut his own throat with that spike on the lake where the behelit finds its way to him showing just how desperate he is in his condition.When he did have to choose to sacrifice hes comrades or not not only was he in the worst mental and physical condition but he might have also been influenced by the god hand we cant say for sure. He even thought about not doing it and leaving a peaceful but unfulfilling life with Casca having to take care of him but that wasnt a life he wanted it wasnt something he could bare however selfish that might seem.When he is reborn as Femto whos to say that his mind or way of thinking wasnt completely altered?Whos to say his more human and kind emotions werent repressed and the more dark and negative emotions maybe even his ego werent amplified? I think it would explain why he did what he did rape Casca etc.Thats the way I see it at least and I think thats what makes him one of the best and most wellwritten villains Ive seen hes complicated flawed and complex like a human is and should be although I still dont think he was a sociopath.gt Ive also been harmed by a sociopath and its greatly effected my personality and trust...And Im sorry you had to go through that I dont think I ever met a sociopath but I can relate to something like that having greatly affected your personality and trust towards others ,Berserk,d4yd3ez,1,t5_2rru6

8167869,0,t3_4qptkx,A minor point perhaps but one that I feel is important nonethelessIm disappointed that all of the scenes of Casca used in the opening seem to show her as a victim or in moments of weakness. Sure postEclipse Casca becomes a horrible victim but thats so striking in large part because of how strong she used to be! And Cascas strength and determination is a large part of why she and Guts developed any sort of relationship in the first place.In short the opening makes Casca look like a typical damsel in distress and I feel that this undermines not only the tragedy of her character arc but also her relationship with Guts.,Berserk,d4yj7ig,2,t5_2rru6

8201975,0,t3_4rnk4h,One of the important factors to remember in how Guts treats Theresia the Counts daughter is that he knows that shes not the most mentally strong person he might not know everything about her past but he knows that dealing with the Apostles can break even a strong mind.  If she wants to be able to live after everything thats happened then she needs something to live for.  So Guts gives her the only thing he thinks is strong enough to drive someone in a situation like this hate.  He wants Theresia to hate him so that she can use that hatred to survive even if it makes him a villain in her eyes.Sure theres an element of him wanting to hurt the Count as well because he knows exposing his form to Theresia will hurt the Count emotionally but many of his actions are designed to prove to Theresia that she herself wants to live taunting her about suicide but then offering her a painful way to survive and giving her a focus so that she doesnt lose herself to madness or despair.As for the grimdark feeling that the series seems to have well...Ill try to keep it vague but this part does risk some unspecific spoilers so proceed at your own riskThe series has a few features that keep it from becoming necessarily as dark as one might fear or expect.  While there are certainly momentssome of them huge and pivotalwhere it seems like everything is terrible and theres no hope left there are also moments where good genuinely triumphs and kindness or friendship are legitimately rewarded.  Especially in later chapters and the most recent story arcs you can see Guts actively at war between the hatred he has used to survive for so long and feelings of hope and camaraderie.  So while the series is never a sunny cheerful romp it doesnt always labor under crushing depression or oppressive darkness.  Im not the sort that cares for relentlessly grimdark stories like Game of Thrones but I love Berserk.spoiler,Berserk,d52su13,2,t5_2rru6

To me Golden Age was very character driven and to lose that character development really hurts the arc overall. I dont think the films are bad or anything but they could have handled some parts a bit better and I think some of the scenes they cut completely should have made it in.

Whats one mercenary company to that mountain of bodies? Throw in the whole cripple to god thing and its a no brainer.Thats why I dont think the sacrifice is what makes Griffith a bad guy but rather the ambition that led him there. That ambition that carried him across all those battlefields that drove him to assassinate anyone who got in his way and caused him to treat his closest friends as tools is what makes him evil. The sacrifice wasnt even really a decision but rather a forced reflection on and acknowledgement of the kind of person he was. Hed already agreed to the sacrifice the moment he decided that his dream was more important than his own humanity a decision he had made long before the eclipse or even his torture.Thats also why its so silly for anyone to pretend they would say no if they were in his shoes.

So I guess we just started thinking anything entirely CGI was even viable years after there were shows and movies that were entire cgi and viable.  years ago? It ended  years ago. Its not like were comparing th century japanese art to the Italian Renaissance. Okay sure lets compare them. I dont see how one looks that much better than the other. And never did I say that Clone Wars had bad animation. Nor did I insinuate it. And I never said anything bad about the fight scenes. Just that all the animation is focused on character movement animation and nothing else. What hair movement? Okay you really dont watch the show and now you are getting childish. Heres an idea princess. Why dont you actually sit down and watch the show and spend some time looking at the animation instead of having a fit about it because you clearly dont know what the fuck you are talking about. I have atleast used video evidence to back up my claims and all you are doing is calling me names and crying. Back up your argument or kick rocks. ,Berserk,d5wrdot,1,t5_2rru6

But if it was part of destiny for that to occur then the demon baby was needed in order for Griffiths essence to reincarnate. Since the demon baby was tainted by griffith himself. But since the baby is the offspring of Guts and Caska it still holds the feelings as their own.

8487964,0,t1_d61tu47,I think thats why I have been able to stick with the series for so long. The writing is a bit more mature than your standard runofthemill shounen manga.Each of the characters are going through a very real struggle and that is what makes them so real.Serpico and Farneses codependency. Weve all had a friendship where we were a little too involved with one another.Farneses wellintentioned but ignorant and misguided views of morality and also her abandonment of her old ideals. Weve all had an instance where we thought our ideas were righteous and infallible and it turned those ideas turned out to be toxic or wrong.Isidro and his desire to be taken seriously by adults he trusts. Weve all experienced a struggle with ageism and its frustrations. And weve all had an instance where we felt validated because an older figure or role model trusted us.Puck and his morality compass to Guts. Especially during the Black Swordsman Arc Guts was getting backed into a corner at every opportunity. He had no one he could trust in and Puck was too small to watch over Casca for him. So in his frustration and desperation did some not so great things. But Puck was always there to remind him Hey you know thats not the only way to handle this. You do have options. I know some friends that went down some destructive paths and I remember saying things in a similar vein. I also think this helped Guts come to the realization that he couldnt finish his journey alone and he HAD to get help.I can definitely relate to Schierke and her sudden thrust into the violent world of adults. She had a painful separation from her mother figure. But she had been entrusted with tools and resources to help her survive. Shes trying to do right by her teachings.Casca is relatable because of the stark differences between her life now and her life previously. She was strong capable and wellrespected. But after some intense trauma she withdrew into herself. Yes she might be physically fine now but she is still very much inside her own mind. I can think of several times when some shit went down and was in my feelings for a bit.But all in all I think Guts is the most relatable character because he is the focus of the reader  of the time. We get to see his motivations and his thoughts. I definitely think that Guts and his struggle with the dark beast past trauma and current despair is very much an allegory for struggling with mental illness. I am no stranger to those struggles so it does resonate with me.There are plenty more examples than what I talked about but I think those stood out the most for me.Also this turned out longer than I expected.EDIT I would also like to add that I found Griffith to be the least relatable character because of his sociopathic tendencies. I dont think that I ever had an ambition or dream that I pursued so rabidly as his. Nor did I ever abandon a dream in such a cavalier fashion that led to destructive consequences.,Berserk,d62jj78,6,t5_2rru6

8548422,0,t1_d69qecm,I disagree I think Wyald was a pretty important character.  Asides from the encounter with Zodd very early on we had not really seen Guts doing battle with any Apostles.  Guts battle with Wyald is really important foreshadowing of what is about to happen the eclipse and it also makes it much more believable that Guts is able to survive the eclipse for as long as he did.  The last time we saw Guts fight an apostle he got his ass kicked immediately by Zodd once he released his apostle form and suddenly during the eclipse he is able to fight off scores of them?  The fight with Wyald shows how much Guts has improved and how much more ferocious he has become and it just makes the eclipse make a lot more sense.,Berserk,d6a4hwe,6,t5_2rru6

8722742,0,t1_d6vxc9o,Honestly I have a basic understanding of some of the Japanese grammar rules and general use of words but Im only just now learning about this specific topic. uwalterbennet shed the light on this for me and theres been quite a bit of discussion about it over on his website www.skullknight.net. You may want to check out the conversation over there and perhaps one of their users whos much more knowledgeable about Japanese than I am could give a better explanation. gt And additionally contextually speaking isnt it possible that Skull Knight himself wasnt aware that the Flowerstorm King was actually a queen? The way he mentions that character it almost seems as if hes only heard legends and hasnt actually met her.With the way he talks about her I was under the impression he knew her personally  or had met her at least. But I suppose we still dont have a concrete answer so its hard to say. I believe well find out pretty soon though.

8758527,0,t1_d70g0l8,I think Ubik said it perfectly From the moment you took possession of that Crimson Behelit you had the qualities to become a demon.  No perhaps I should say that because you had those qualities it fell into your hands.  He was not selected as a child by the God Hand he was molded into the man that would receive the Crimson Behelit by God itself.  Its because Griffith by nature is a piece of shit that the Eclipse could even happen.  Of course it would have happened to someone else that had been ordained by God.  Everything that Griffith is was decided before his birth though he had no control over any of it its just the man he is.  Griffith always had to be evil because thats what Causality dictates.  In this world is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

8792407,0,t3_50jrfr,I think we got more of an insight to Griffiths goals the means are the end so Griffith will always want more he is the king of longing as it was. He will challenge the other God Hand as his next step in his lust for ruling. Apostle civil war God Hand civil war. Guts Skull Knight and respectively everyone else who opposes Griffith will take advantage of the confusion in Falconia.I dont want to make my comment directly about this but if it does go that way it may explain the  angels from the Gaiseric tale. A different God Hand existed  arriving in Gaiserics kingdom but  angels leave the th being created just like Griffith. The th angel always over comes the  others and starts a new God Hand it could just be a cycle in Causality. We know times of these things happening. We get a God Hand every  years respectively and one can be birthed into the mortal world every  years. Why are these things known if it hasnt happened before?So I think Griffith is part of this cycle and will play directly into Causality Guts however is known for struggling against it and may be able to break the cycle. He and his child are both anomalies in Causality. Guts survived a death a death you can never escape and the child was unaccounted for by Causality during Griffiths rebirth. These two characters are outside of the Causalitys grasp only slightly and can break up the cycle completely if they hit the pivoting instances that Causality relies on.How this may happen I cant begin to think of.Also... This was all just bullshit I thought up and the logic can probably be broken down by someone who knows the source material better than I.,Berserk,d74q7ir,15,t5_2rru6

BSA and Lost Children completely glossed over. Music was bad and the song that wasnt bad Hai Yo overstays its welcome quite a bit. CLANG.

9230485,0,t3_56ordj,I dont think there was ever a turning point.  I dont think Griffith performed the sacrifice cold bloodedly.   I think that was very much so emotionally motivated.  I think it was him trying to be cold trying to create the illusion of calm like he has done so many times before.  Consider when the little boy died in service to Griffith.  He was absolutely devastated we saw him claw open his own skin but he did not show it to anybody except Casca who saw it by accident.  He also used the arbitrary rules concerning Guts belonging to him to hide that he desperately did not want Guts to leave.  Another example I read his dream speech as something he tells himself to be comfortable with the fact that he leads men to death.  He puts out the illusion of distance and coldness constantly and I think his sacrificing the hawks was that as well.  I think it was a part of him saying look they signed on to serve your dream they were they are prepared to die for your dream so why does it matter how they die so long as it is to that end?  Its a part of him making him commit to the illusion because he does not want to look like a hypocrite and the other part of him agreeing because he does not want to be hurt anymore as well as a cocktail of desperation and sudden hope.  I think the Griffith that said I sacrifice is exactly the same Griffith that once saved Casca as a child.  It was when he met God and said this is the last tear I will ever cry that he truly committed to being cold.  But even then I think in the end of the story Femto will still harbor some deeply buried sentimentality because Cascas rape looked like a deliberate slight against Guts there was true hate there and hate is far from apathetic coldness.  In short Griffith never switched personalities he was and still is a hypocrite who hides behind distance.,Berserk,d8m158o,0,t5_2rru6
9231526,0,t1_d8loejf,No. Guts hasnt done anything himself to defy predestination. Skull Knight is the one who saves him and SK is even affected by the laws of causality.

10583726,0,t1_dd7lvuj,That is a good example of the unique take on good vs evil in this story. He becomes more ruthless and brutal as things progress and starts appearing more and more like a monster but he also focuses that rage more and more on protecting people. At first he only wants to protect his comrades but as it progresses I think he starts sympathizing with other people more. The kids he helps out are a great example like the lost children chapter when he is still in the solo black swordsman phase he threatens to kill the girl if she gets in his way and then Puck catches him crying later.Guts reaction in the face of demons evil is definitely one of my favorite parts too.

10818172,0,t1_ddvsq3x,Yeah I noticed that too basically happened after the troll story when he realized he had new friends and Im not a fan. Guts is the best character of the series along with Griffith and focusing on his new party so much was kind of disappointing. I wouldnt mind if they were more interesting but they arent. Farneses development was rushed and the others are just boring and in Isidros case even annoying.His new role as Papa Guts is sweet and all but I really hope for some sort of progression in his story amp that his character moves forward. I think Miura dragged the whole cure Casca plot out for too long.Puck has definitely regressed as a character he was great during the BS Lost children and Conviction arcs and then just went downhill. The problem is really Schierke here because she basically took over his role I definitely preferred Puck.I agree that Griffiths decision to sacrifice the hawks isnt as black and white as people make it out to be he was tortured for so long and was a shell of his former self he couldnt fulfill his dream anymore etc. but the whole rape after he becomes Femto is just evil. I dont think there is any justification for that amp since he has been reborn he sadly has been just emotionless and bland.Thats why I liked the series more when it focused on Apostles. The Count and Rosine were very interesting villians and not typical evil. Compare them to the sea god or the other generic monsters trolls etc. Guts amp co. have been fighting for the past few arcs and I think the series lost something. ,Berserk,ddvtgp7,2,t5_2rru6

10832414,0,t3_5ukctw,So I noticed this was going on a few days ago and I decided to join you guys. I needed a reason to reread Berserk and this seemed like a pretty good reason. So I ended up reading  volumes in a matter of a couple days. That was fun. Anyways...So here we finally reach the end of the Black Swordsman arc an arc that has never been properly adapted into any of the anime. IMO its a very good start for the series as in the  ish chapters we get great side characters and bad guys that are developed so damn well. Theresias plight is very tragic and we see that she wished she hadnt followed Pucks advice and now hates Guts. The reasoning for the Counts actions are elaborated on and he becomes an almost tragic character if not for his grisly actions towards humans. The most lasting impact from these chapters however is meeting the God Hand. A certain Griffith makes his first appearance here and man does Gutss rage show. We also see the other four members here but dont learn much about them. And its also in this volume that we get the infamous Guts crying panel. Like damn. Does anyone have a solid reason for why hes crying here? I have some ideas but I feel like Im missing something. Regardless this whole arc was tragic so seeing Guts weep like that is a good way to end the arc. At the very end we start the Golden Age arc and not too much happens aside from us learning more about Gutss early childhood. Not too much to talk about here yet but one thing I found interesting was how Gambinos wife when she found Guts strongly resembled Casca after losing her mindspoiler. Not sure if it has any relevance or if Im just reading too deep here but I thought it was interesting. Great volume overall. Im glad this is happening because I need to reread this series to get a better handle on it and because I love it so much. Looking forward to the rest of this!,Berserk,ddxacmy,4,t5_2rru6

10991105,0,t1_dedij7a,gtGuts isnt the type to betray Casca? You mean the guy who was so devoted to her that her ditched her in a cave because he couldnt stand seeing what she had been reduced to? Guts absolutely adores Casca. He didnt leave her in the cave because he couldnt stomach her. He left her because he wanted revenge and though Casca would be safer at the cave. He realized his mistake and every choice hes made from then on out is connected in some way to Casca. He would never betray her not like that.gtExcept its been shown that even in his rage Guts can still be ruthlessly cold and calculating. While fighting Rosine he hid in fire to wait for an opportune moment to strike counting on her to come to Jills aid when the girl was surrounded by flames. I repeat he hid in fire! If hes willing to do that then I can buy the notion that hell willingly have sex with a demon to get an easy kill on her as well.Guts has a history of leaning on his extreme resilience and doesnt much care for his body given the right catalyst however we dont know how that translates to sex with an apostle no less. Its OOC.gtCant say that Guts really has a fear of erotica per se. He was perfectly willing to have sex with Casca and at no point was he ever feeling hesitation or trepidation about it. It was only in the middle of the act itself when he started freaking out. And once again being as that incident triggered a violent episode in him I doubt hed really be all that concerned about what effect sex would have on his psyche when hes dealing with someone hes planning to kill anyway.The only time hes shown having sex outside of that scene he freaks tf out and almost kills his lover. He was extremely awkward around Griffith too. Of course this is all up for debate. There is no right or wrong answer. Its just fun to see things from another perspective.,Berserk,dedt26r,4,t5_2rru6

Ash crow couldve worked as better ending theme in a way,Berserk,detdllr,4,t5_2rru6
11156776,0,t1_devsodh,I also think that the movie change made sense. Guts may not be an assassin but Griffith was sending him on an assassination mission. If I were Griffith Id tell him to avoid using any equipment that could be traced. The idea was to go in and kill Julius without raising the alarm so preparing to fight a bunch of guards wasnt the priority hes skilled enough to kill an unarmored nobleman with a regular longsword and I kind of appreciated the fact that the movie showed he doesnt need a giant sword to kick a lot of ass. I didnt see this as misrepresenting Guts character and it solved an issue that had bugged me.Maybe Miura had a compelling reason to show Guts using his giant sword but I dont think we can rule out the possibility that he just made a little mistake since he committed a similar implausibility in his depiction of the Battle of Doldrey. In the manga Griffith baits Gennon into committing all his forces to pursit while sending Cascas cavalry to rush in through the castle gate but they would have been sitting ducks trapped outside if the garrison had done the sensible thing and closed the gate after the troops had sallied forth. Griffith was basically counting on the assumption that his enemies would do an uncommonly stupid thing for no reason. We find out later that Adon was lying in wait but apparently Griffith didnt know that because Casca was surprised by Adons ambush and if Griffith had known that Adon was leaving the door open as a trap he would have warned Casca about itall the more so if Adons trap was the reason that he expected Cascas entry to be possible in the first place. The movie neatly resolves this issue by having Casca and her group disguise themselves in Blue Whale armor and force Adon to bluff them in. Regrettably the movie then takes another step back by skipping the part where Zodd throws Guts his sword but the point is that even if the movies got more wrong than right I am arguing that at least two of their changes made the plot more believable without negatively impacting characterization or the themes of the story.,Berserk,dewlxcu,1,t5_2rru6

11207266,0,t1_df2azts,gt The people of Falconia hold the same weight of importance as the Band. So why can he sacrifice the Hawks and not the people of Falconia?I dont really know what youre getting at here. Hes not sacrificing Falconia. Hes already a God Hand why would he need to sacrifice anything? Furthermore the point of the ceremony is to sever ones humanity so that they can become a demon. Griffith has already done this. He no longer has any more humanity to shed. The scene at the Hill of Swords even touches on this where Griffith had gone back to see if anything could reawaken his human emotions and found that it wasnt happening. So following that he wouldnt be able to sacrifice Falconia if he needed to because he doesnt have human emotions to vest in the thing to begin with. But he wont have to do that because hes already a God Hand. What would he accomplish by sacrificing anything at this point anyway? And going back to his definition of a friend  Griffith was not sacrificing his friends. He was not asked to do that. He was asked to sacrifice the organization that he had spent his life building. gt The narrative going against what Im saying goes against what the damn author himself wrote lol.The narrative does not contradict the author at all.

Also the fantasy aspect takes a while to develop. Theres a feeling that its just typical human stuff and Guts is bad ass then suddenly Zodd throws your world of kilter.,Berserk,df61w7r,1,t5_2rru6
11249019,0,t1_df70ykw,Very true Its just the difference of opinions. If Miura wanted to he could make Guts become stronger than he is with the armor on his own because it is fiction.

11599377,0,t1_dganz60,Its not that I want something greater than or even equal to the manga an anime adaptation is supposed to make the story come to life in a new medium so we can look at the same thing from a different perspective. Berserk  sure wasnt a AAA production but it had such a great sense of atmosphere and storytelling that its become a classic. Like the shot in Episode  where Guts chops the Snake Baron in half you have like five shots where you see the sword swinging before it even hits and hear Guts screaming then theres the moment of impact and then the followthrough where you see the Baron flying in pieces with a bloodcurdling scream with Hirasawas frightening music playing in the background. That totally gives me the shivers! Even the Golden Age movies which I and others have severely criticized for compressing the story too much and underdeveloping the characters had some eyepopping scenes that have stuck with me. Remember that sequence at the end where Guts is running through the forest after the Eclipse seeing the faces of his dead comrades go flashing by and screaming with all his might? That scene is animated with so much feeling it makes me wanna cry.I dont think theres anything unfair about expecting an anime that makes me glad I watched it. I just cant enjoy this adaptation the way Ive enjoyed other adaptations of my favorite manga because it feels like even their best just isnt good enough. Ive seen way too many good and decent anime to be persuaded to think that this fugly show is something we should be grateful for. Right now I kind of envy those who can watch it and feel entertained.,Berserk,dgasqm8,4,t5_2rru6

I feel like Im watching a forced comedy on what Ive known to be a dark horrific depressing and deep storyline. Especially when you compare it to Griffiths followers. Even when you compare them to the original band of the hawk characters. These new followers of Guts are just totally out of context. Which is why Im assuming theyll be massacred to give that real dark feeling that is Berserk.TLDR I hope all of those new innocent addition of followers get absolutely obliterated by Griffiths party.
