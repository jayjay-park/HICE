425045,0,t3_1y0ist,Imbeciles! Klein exclaims They dare treat me like I am unable to defend myself when they clearly dont even understand the enemy they face! Klein turns to Isaac and shouted You fool decapitating a wight is not enough to kill it! It doesnt have a brain its animated by dark magic! Stop zoning out focusing on your commander and turn your eyes to the fight! Klein then focused a fire blast on the group of weaker creatures incinerating some of them unfortunate enough to be close to the epicenter. He then leapt to the side as the now headless wight threw its Javelin at him. ,Fire_Emblem_RP,cfotkb0,1,t5_2usn4

2684142,0,t3_2qo3hq,Next up! Isaac and Cavgar! The war monk stood in the ring across from his opponent. a tall mage of slight build with curly brown hair. Lets have at it monk! the mage called out as he readied his weapon a fire tome used for training. Isaac nodded solemnly and readied his own stance. Begin!Cavgar quickly conjured flames around him and sent a flurry of balls out at Isaac. The war monk reacted quickly deftly sidestepping each flame as they flew past him. This mage was good Isaac couldnt mess around in this fight. He charged forward launched into the air and fell upon Cavgar with a spinning strike. Isaacs opponent was nimble however he dodged just as easily as Isaac did dancing around the axs swings. He returned the swings with more sprays of flame but they proved as ineffective as before.The exchanges continued on for nearly a minute with no progress being made on either side. Focus... Focus... Isaac mumbled under his breath searching for an opening. Isaac lunged at Cavgar who dodged right but his footing was not as sure. There! Isaac took advantage of the stumble and spun back around to the mages rear. Using the force of the spin Isaac swung around aiming his ax straight for the back of his opponents head. That is until the monk realized what he was doing. Isaac threw himself back causing him to miss his opponents head by an embarrassingly wide margin. The mage quickly countered blasting Isaac in the chest with a spray of flames. The war monk tumbled backward his ax sliding away from him across the ring.Cavgar takes this round and advances to the finals! The crowd cheered loudly as the mage raised his fists to his fans and Isaac pulled himself to his feet. He silently walked from the ring and approached Tauroneo. Im sorry General I couldnt do it. Even with a training weapon I had no doubt that blow wouldve killed him... victory wasnt worth that mans life. Yet I am ashamed you challenged me to win this tournament and I failed. What is to be my fate?,Fire_Emblem_RP,cn8xra9,1,t5_2usn4
