20078,0,t3_1ubgh3,Given that you are in the UK you have a few more engine options than those of us in North America and more model years available as well.  Ill try and outline everything for you.The petrol engines in the pre model the  were pretty terrible in terms of reliability and thats probably where you saw the  mile explosion comment.  They were really that unreliable apparently.  The diesel engines in the s are pretty good although there have been some reliability issues over here in Canada most of which seem to be maintenance and cold weather issues which dont seem to be as common on your side of the pond.  My diesel  is sitting around  KM  mi right now and going strong.  That being said I dont think many of the diesel s are lasting beyond  km.  All of the engines in the  were made by Mercedes.For the newer cars the  model youll have the option of a petrol engine with or without a turbo The Brabus has a turbo or you can get  a diesel.  The diesel  is basically the same Mercedes engine as in the  although it is apparently a bit more reliable.  I still wouldnt expect more than  kmish out of it though.  The petrol engines are made by Mitsubishi in the  and seem to be way more reliable than the Mercedes engines with way less problems popping up.  These engines should last quite a bit longer than the Mercedes ones.  I believe someone on SCoA has somewhere around  miles on an  or  nonturbo We dont get the turbo or diesel s in NASee THIS page to identify what model car your company has if you dont know the model year.Hopefully that helps you out!EDIT  Also wanted to add that the new model  should be available in Europe as of November  so thats another factor to consider,SmartCar,cegpw31,1,t5_2tp0v
