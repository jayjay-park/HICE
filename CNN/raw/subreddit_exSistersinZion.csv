5710546,0,t3_3smsvi,At a church school I was asked  by one of my male professors why are you still in my classes? You and your husband have a baby now right? Yes I had just had a baby and had completed essays from the hospital room after giving birth mother fucker! I was always very straightforward in classes about getting a solid career going in my field after graduation. I was laughed at and scoffed at a lot for it. A few male students even said you do great work much better than mine but dont you think you should focus your efforts more on cooking and sewing and stuff? ,exSistersinZion,cx4y692,3,t5_2s3h2
