1139648,0,t1_chxtb29,If you have a spot then Thursday is probably better. Depending on when you would get there on Wednesday it probably wouldnt be worth the extra  early entry fee. For example say you leave Calgary at AM that means you wouldnt get there til about PM then add another  hours for lineup and that puts you at like PM before you are in. Kind of a waste since itll be dark and hard to find your group.,Shambhala,chxtktg,1,t5_2sdhu

3096182,0,t3_2vlhac,Dont bring any glass of any kind bottles s.. If they find one theyre going to make you take everything out and go for a good look. Any alcohol they find theyll take from you but it is possible to sneak it in.Personal amounts of substances they might let you keep but its up to them really be respectful it works wonders. My first year I had a quarter and so did my friend we both told the guards and they let us keep it after taking a look at it. The only thing difficult to buy once your in is pot because its not easy to sneak in large quantities. ,Shambhala,coix2ro,5,t5_2sdhu

4096697,0,t3_37hjdt,honestly i always always wear feather head dresses to raves as i too love them an insane amount however cultural appropriation is a massive and really under represented issue not just with the native american war bonnet but many other traditions and clothing. I think its very important to distinguish between the specific headdresses that are incredibly offensive to wear specifically the native american war bonnet which is what pops into your mind when you think of feather headdresses and why this is an issue and feather headdresses in general. if you go and make yourself a headdress i promise its not that hard you can design it to specifically not be offensive. maybe take elements of it that you find inspiring but overall be original and make something new. not only does that show respect but in a way it is a much more beautiful way to pay homage to those war bonnets. each feather in a native american war bonnet was earned through specific acts of bravery in battle i think there are four kinds of acts that count not sure at all though a full headdress meant a lifetime of incredible deeds. by making your own you go through a process of creation and earn the feathers on your head. definitely less intense than the original example but still a beautiful thing. tldr if you want to wear a feather headdress wear one that isnt a replica of a native american war bonnet. create your own!,Shambhala,crn8z0f,1,t5_2sdhu

4717051,0,t1_ctp20qr,People start showing up on Tuesday but please dont do this.  Its frowned upon by the festival and the only reason they allow it is because people would line up on the highway which was a danger to everyone and they were told to let people in.No security checks  entry happen until am Wednesday.Anytime after am Wednesday morning works there will be a steady stream of people from then on.
