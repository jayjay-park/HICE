318793,0,t1_cfdrefy,Taken literally they are not characters with said traits therefore they are moved to clock since they dont meet the requirements.  It doesnt make sense otherwise to have that as a consequence if all of SAO characters are avatar characters.I sent an email to both Bushi branches to see the ruling of this so well see.

320169,0,t3_1xrg2g,Uh off the top of my head the Sayaka and Mami card is really good at least in my deck.  Level  hits and you look at the top card of your deck put it on the top or bottom then when it attacks you reveal the top card of your deck and put it in your hand if its a Magic character good to check for a climax that might be a trigger and put it on bottom or get a character you might need into your hand.Ive never seen a blueyellow with no red in it but hey thats one of the reasons I like Madoka most combinations are possible.hope that helps.EDIT  After a bit of googling I found this Just save or write down the cards in the picture and bam youve got yourself a deck.,WeissSchwarz,cfdye4r,3,t5_2uolt

1069934,0,t3_26cx9u,Im assuming youre referring to the English releases so Ill leave out the new set.The trial deck has three really good things about itThe level  Honoka has a free come into play search.The level  red event pumps and salvages.The level  Oh! Love and Peace Myus has a cost  k boost to a character.These three things make it really strong as a starting deck in my opinion or at least they did when I bought it a year ago.The full set itself has a couple of interesting things about it. Its a heavy change set its really hard to build a good deck without the change. All of the change cards change from RGB to yellow and the set as a whole has to play yellow. If youre not comfortable with the color then the set wont be a good match for you. The level  yellow has a global k boost to all of your characters and clock heal which is really useful and its an uncommon so its a bit easier to get a play set of. The best level  in the set in my opinion is the green level  Nico who sends characters to clock on reverse.The colors are all strong paired with yellow but I recommend RYG.While I dont think its a high tier deck in Japanese I think itll be a good edition in English. Kill la Kill is one of the next sets to release in English and with the two days its been out its been really strong so Im not sure how it will affect the English meta.Edit There is also a set of cards that are alternate artworks a common uncommon and rare. Youre guaranteed to get one per pack and I believe it replaces one of the commons that you get so keep in mind you might need more packs to get all the commons. One of the cards is a  level  with  turn its played which can be pretty useful to kill your opponents runners.,WeissSchwarz,chpwmij,5,t5_2uolt

2351101,0,t3_2lysdo,Actually I believe that it has a chance to be released in the west.To be honest the release of Fairy Tail made me surprised! Maybe its about popularity.Heres my reasoning to why the set can be released here The thing that convinced me the most is the fact that Fairy Tail is licensed by Funimation and apparently Shakugan no Shana is ALSO licensed by Funimation too thus if its popular enough it can be released here. But one thing I have to warn is that Im not sure if Bushiroad has the discuss this with the studio.You just need some hope.

NeoStandard does not allow mixing of series however the same series but different setsProject diva F and F nd Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari etc are okay. Generally if theyre from the same universe its okay.    The less popular Standard format allows mixing freely however it is not played a lot not even casually mostly because its a pain to theorycraft strong things and when someone does its really broken and breaks the game occasionally exploiting loop holes and so on since the game is not really balanced around it.,WeissSchwarz,cnmf5xv,1,t5_2uolt

You can play JP or English. for instance the shop i go to lets us play both. the thing is the game in the US is split between Heart of the Cards and Bushiroad USA. being that tournaments are run on a case by case in whether or not you can play Jap or eng.

3208909,0,t1_coulc3m,I see what youre saying. I thought of that as well. However say you were pushed to level  first turn. Most decks are constructed to be very conservative on stock level  or  with cards having pay options to dig out things like climaxes so whether or not you could actually play those level s or not which you likely could you still have a hand with level s in it most likely right? I mean after clocking second turn youll have  cards in hand.

3567881,0,t1_cpyx2x5,Ill play around with the deck ratios and add in Aegis and Yukiko in there somewhere. Aegis will most likely replace Nanako Helping out since both are essentially my first turn attackers. I agree that brainstorms are my only way to plus hand size unfortunately.I tried to make the level  small but you bring up good points in that it just messes up my level  climax combo and the minus  from hand to bring an early level  is a beefy cost. I guess granted that when it comes into play I essentially draw  discard  to turn it into just a minus  from hand it mitigates a bit of the drawback. Late game though Im aware that its not ideal to play that card since I run the risk of discarding climaxes that should otherwise stay inside the deck. And yeah antichange seems to be more common nowadays.Protagonist doesnt have any good ways to finish off opponents so thats why I included the Burn cancel climax combos. If there were better ones I had access to I would definitely find a way to work those in. The only other card I could run unless I want to splash in another color would be the antiencore level  but in my opinion its a lackluster card unless I included backupsevent power ups in the deck. Its all good I appreciate your input and advice. Thanks for taking the time to respond to me. Ill try and mix up the deck a little to see how it can run smoother. What I know for sure the deck needs is brainstorm so Ill be focusing on that right now.,WeissSchwarz,cpyyrjt,1,t5_2uolt

3768200,0,t1_cqlsl5m,gtyoure losing out on some element of your lv gameI dont with my railgun build. Dont know what that says about how you play it. Fielding k characters is easy for a lot of decks. Level supports are a thing and even without too have you ever played against KanColle?. Getting as much power as possible is important if you want to keep MisaKuro on field and safe against clock kick and reversal. Id rather not have to depend on salvaging her the next turn when I can just defend her with good power and force my opponent to minus. That extra  power from Kiyama will matter. I dont run change and instead use level  Saten cards to utilize Haruue when I need power at level . I run four Takitsubos and have no problems just replacing her the turn I use her because a level  green Railgun field sticks around for a while which lets me build advantage without committing hand. ROFL have you ever played against clock kick? Adjusted for it by preemptively searching for backups? Ramming characters in to create situations in which the opponent is forced to try to clock kick a higher power target? People adjust like that when they play against MisaKuro. ,WeissSchwarz,cqlswhz,1,t5_2uolt

If you cut the deck size down to  maybe restricted to  climaxes? you could draft with four players which seems like it might be better than two.

Hopefully its the early play Miku but take any Level  you get.If you pull off the soundless voice combo then focus more on grabbing the Level  counters Level s and more soundless voice climaxes.

7700152,0,t1_d3gjzci, Level  runner bomb is indeed good. It is fortunate that you found it Id pick atleast  as itll improve the gameplay at  a lot and most importantly kill off Hibikis and runners which for this deck is hard to deal with. Complements your  backrow destroyers for ultimate L carnage. At  itll ocasionally net an extra damage as it might mean an empty slot.  Youll rarely force your opponent to to fight for their hand to be honest. Most will have a stronger power on level . RinArcher have a weak level  game which is why the  archer bomb is so good. It sides or strikes a low target. Helps another card reverse and will often be side attacked for  soul since any card attacking it dies leaving an empty slot to hit. Hard plus  extra damage next turn or a heal effectively! Success! Requires soul climax to be most effective. k is a subpar climax card to use in this format in my opinion. You often lag behind in damage which can be impossible to come back form. Definately never use a k unless forced. Especially as you said that this deck really does not suffer problems with handsize. Quite a contradiction to run a climax to cover a noneexisting hole with a cheap patchwork pressed over it. The  draw here is not so useful as the  lost soul potential. Youll want to hit for ish with every attack every turn from L until game ideally. Your clock side point did not convince me much. You use a worse climax dealing less damage and ocasionally have to use a skill at level  that deals damage to you for cards over one that doesnt. Thats the only thing we need to compare here. Fashionable glasses is only really good at  and sometimes at l. The act of clocking is a hard plus for a damage but most importantly draws you two cards which can be events and climaxes. This is really important. Resulting in an absolutely MASSIVE increase in climaxes amp events to hand. Youll want to clock in the early game regardless so using it as some sort of leverage in the argument is flawed. London Rin can be skipped if wallet does not support it but is better in nearly any aspect and as its on reverse it even goes past most antisalvage. Not having encore is fine and a choice of yours which I support but it is completely amazing during level . Many run it because its cool. Many dont. I cant see either side winning more tournaments. I usually run  of the clock encore but there are so many other good s that this is in no way mandatory. Youll do well with other cards. I prefer backups and s over clock encore in general tbh. I go back and forth between running and not running the clock encore. Suicidesclock encore is fun at L but falls of rest of game  I much prefer cards that work all the time.,WeissSchwarz,d3hgg2c,1,t5_2uolt

8235849,0,t3_4s6xtb,Disclaimer I am not a milky holmes player I simply observe other people that play the set.OKAY with that out of the way let me introduce you to your new best friend  Elly from the most recent Extra Booster. This is an extremely powerful card that makes the most out of Milkys gimmick switching cards in and out of the Level Zone. Every time you put a card into your Level either by your own effect or simply by getting hit to Level Up you can get a free card. Yay! warning this card is  bucks apiece but it is so so so worth it seriously this card is greatThe way Milky Holmes is able to do what Milky Holmes does best is with Level Swappers. These cards have abilities that let you switch cards in your Level Zone with cards in your Waiting Room allowing you access to more colors as well as activating various abilities such as the  Elly. Some of the most popular level swappers include Level  Sharo brainstormer Level  Cordelia Level  Elly support which also has great synergy with Gold Bars which you will probably want to run Level  Elly levelsupportAt Level  the card I see being played by all my local Milky players is Elly in Bath Towel She allows you to build lots of stock so that you can freely spam your  Elly to get lots of free cards. Her Climax Combo is a Gold Bar which works with the Lv Elly LevelSwapper I mentioned earlier. At the same time she has potentially to get really big with her other ability. Note that she needs you to put a Climax into the Level Zone to get her  power. Why would you want a Climax in Level Zone though?Meet your other new best friend This is a k counter for  stock but the downside is it really a downside though is that you have to put a Climax from Waiting Room into your Level. This can give you a really big power boost on some of your cards like the  Elly. You can use Level Swappers abilities to get the Climax out of the Level Zone on your next turn. Putting a Climax into Level on your opponents turn also allows you to proc the  Elly. You will want  copies of this in your deck  of the time.At Level  you have lots and I mean LOTS of options Id say some of the more solid ones are the Burner Sharo from the latest Extra Booster Clock Shooter Elly Restander Elly Healer Sharo and Witch Sharo Take your pick of the lot those just happen to be the ones I see played more frequently. Theres plenty more good Lvs to look at these are the first that come to mind for me though. I only posted Green and Red ones and although theyre all quite good be sure to check out the Blue and Yellow ones too since this deck can easily play  or even  colors once youre experienced with the deck.,WeissSchwarz,d571boa,1,t5_2uolt

But the fact that those cards are both Level s so the advantage of the  event is way more pronounced.,WeissSchwarz,d91gpqf,2,t5_2uolt

9549017,0,t1_d9q12nr,Sorry I think I confused the Mikasa you were talking about.I usually only run the level  that comes from the level  being front attacked. She has the burn on reverse combo the climax gets affected by antisalvage but its not too bad.Eren is a good tool against early level and change but if you can push damage early youll play it just because your opponent has reached level  before you do.Regarding madoka the level  has nice utility and even some very good beaters but I feel the level  sayakas cant really hold up the board effectively. At level  I feel the Kyokos are a bit lacking as well as hand encore isnt enough nowadays also they occupy a whole lot of slots given that they need the Sayaka assist. I usually bet on level  in my deck with Sayaka heal and Homura PR shooter but in this case if you do catch KC you have to heal only through Sayakas wish and Sayaka lvl  becomes suboptimal.,WeissSchwarz,d9q43qx,1,t5_2uolt
9659880,0,t3_5d618r,If you play against a deck that needs to be set up with stock and the right cards in hand and what not for example Illyas early play kuro wall then you want to push them as fast as possible. Dont let them set up strike first. If you play a defensive turtle deck you want to stall out the game by playing more conservatively. Some decks not limited to would be index. Some decks dont really care for the pacing of the game too much and has strong finisher to catch up TLR comes to mind. All depending on who you are playing what their decks set out to do and what your deck does. Do you want to play to win or do you want to have fun and see what other peoples combos are like. ,WeissSchwarz,da3s6fx,1,t5_2uolt

10275767,0,t3_5n5933,. Most newer sets have their level s in BP only printed at R or RR which would almost completely cripple them. For example the only Level  character playable from Gochiusa would be the TD Lv. This is also true with regards to Rewrite as well before the new set comes out.. Oh Haruhi Suzumiya could be murderous. Trouble Girl Haruhi is both in the TD and is C in the BP. Old Mikuru Lv also only U and she has climax lockout tech by herself. . Some cards will see too much use in standard. A lot of decks that would run the red door CX would use the Haruhi  assist that can nuke a front row level  or lower when you trigger the door..

You can expect to get about  of each RR and  of each R. You can pick up singles to complete your playsets though.Youll definitely be able to make fun decks though.  boxes will get you more than playsets of the Cs and Us so there will be more than enough cards to construct decks.,WeissSchwarz,dgj3kww,2,t5_2uolt
