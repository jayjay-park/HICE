3097938,0,t3_2vjj86,Fighter in the Wind was a pretty good if heavily romanticised tale of the origins of kyokushin karate. Also as a nice pastiche in Chocolat you get to see Jeeja Yanin paying homage to each one of the greats by fighting in each of their styles across the films scenes.

7253539,0,t1_d229luz,For me it depends on the choreographer and in general the tone of the films for that time. Sammo did Ip Man  choreography and I think that that series really stands out. We are definitely seeing a lack of younger skilled MA actors and directors as compared to the greats of the past but definitely into the s there are a ton of really great MA films especially out of HK  drunken master  once up a time series etc.I do agree though that there is a world of absolutely amazing MA films that I dont think will ever be surpassed. It was the training Jackie and co. went through and an entire generation of folks that literally put their bodies on the line for this work.,kungfucinema,d22obuj,3,t5_2seq8

7798201,0,t1_d3sf5v1,I literally only like the action in that movie. I find pretty much every nonaction scene aside from the opening elephant stuff to be hard to watch. Fortunately the movie is almost walltowall action! That thai style most visible in the early s is so damn brutal! The choreography isnt really up to HK par but they took pain and disrespect to the human body to a whole new level! Ive always preferred this film to the more hyped original Ong Bak though that films chase scene is classic.,kungfucinema,d3skth1,2,t5_2seq8

9265443,0,t3_57au2r,I thought it was a bit tough but I tried to just roll with it and ended up really enjoying the whole series of films. While I dont think you have to commit all of your brain power to the plot you should probably pay some attention to get a general grasp of the goings on.If you dont mind some spoilers I just read a really good article which explains more of the films context. I found it extremely helpful even having watched the films. ,kungfucinema,d8qglkw,2,t5_2seq8

Not recommended at all. As for House of Flying Daggers it is just too cheesy and heavyhanded and the fights arent that good. It does look great though.Planned for next week The Grandmaster  The Enforcer  AKA My Father is a Hero maybe more.,kungfucinema,de9210n,2,t5_2seq8

11750142,0,t3_62lg98,I would say that my favorite way to introduce friends to a new genre us to focus on . The type of stories or styles of stories they like and . The variety of the genre.If shes a fan of love stories and dramas then I would first suggest crouching tiger. Its a great visual work of art and wonderfully sad human story. See if she likes that. If she does then Hero is a must. Other favorites in the historic wire fu genre Fearless Iron Monkey House of flying DaggersThe other way to go are slightly more historic action movies with less focus on wires that are often heavier on action Dragon Ip Man Fist of Legend. Oddly enough many have a very heavy pro Chinese history tone so beware.If she likes a bit of weird esoteric comedies then Id suggest kung fu hustle. Odd social situations and behaviors weird quips and a very silly story. The action is pretty fun as well. If she likes that then Id suggest shaolin soccer afterwards. But realize that Stephen Chow movies especially outside of these two are often story first and kung fu second. Other Stephen Chow adventure favorite Journey to the West from Beijing with loveIf she likes more of a Charlie Chaplin style of comedy and much more heavy on the awesome sunny visuals then Jackie Chan all the way. I personally think Legend of Drunken master is probably his best. After that his Condor series of movies are very accessible and fun although some are slightly dated. Armor of God accidental spy who am i super cop operation condor twelve zodiacEarly s hollywood action movies movies are full of fun fight scenes as well. Even from non Asian actors like Transporter series Bourne series War Kiss of the Dragon and of course Rush Hour.Outside of both hollywood and China are they and Korean action movies like Ong Bok Protector Man from Nowhere Bittersweet Life but thats honestly a whole nother genre of stuff as well.And finally the contemporary martial arts action genre is full of great action scenes although the brutality has become much bigger Raid  is probably my favorite action movie of all time however it is definitely not for the faint at heart. And the Raid Redemption has more action but perhaps even more brutal. Killshot  Flashpoint and Special ID all have some great Kung fu in them while being less brutal but still pretty gritty. Id suggest taking it slow.  ,kungfucinema,dgrwp6v,2,t5_2seq8
