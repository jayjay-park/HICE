10854,0,t3_1u8f6f,Im with you my friend I started keto at the beginning of December and saw a huge weight loss.  Then it seemed like the holidays and stress just came at once so I said to hell with it Im going to enjoy it and come back to it.  Im back to where I started but the nice thing is that I know how it works what my body likes what I can and cant eat and that it takes a lot to kick me out of ketosis.  You learn and you live and keto is all about living. ,keto,cefo5bq,2,t5_2rske
11126,0,t1_cefg0wz,Everything is subjective butWhat worked  Living alone. I lived alone at the time so all carb temptations at home were non existent. I threw out EVERY bad carb in the house except some potatoes that turned into some weird ugly things with shit growing out of them.  Free access to the gym meant that I could exercise when I wanted at whatever time I wanted.    Constant support from friends who didnt force me to eat that slice of cake or those french fries etc.  If you have a sweet tooth still instead of drinking soda resort to KoolAid with your favorite sugar substitute.  Since KoolAid is mostly water it adds on to your water drinking goals.What didnt work  Daily measurementsweigh ins.  Keep it to once a week if that.  It really unmotivates you even if you dont think it does because weight fluctuates through out the day.The wheels came off due to stress antidepressants weight in a pill I call it and just generally a failed plan of fixing the symptoms not the problems.  I am an emotional eater a binge eater and a stress eater.  I eat when I get happy sad depressed if Im stressed out etc. If I limit myself a few days a few days later I full on gorge myself.  Keto isnt a fix for your mental health.  I fucked up the first time and thought that because I was getting skinnier I was invincible.  Once I had shed off a few pounds and felt more confident I started being a ladys man and that contributed as well.  Suddenly the trips to the gym were slowly being moved back.  Slowly dinner dates included that slice of pieice cream.  Suddenly Im at Olive Garden with a beautiful woman eating pasta non stop with bread sticks.  Just because you are happy and with a beautiful woman doesnt mean you have made it and you should stop whatever progress you made and assume you finished.This time around Im seeking to change my mental health as well as my physical health.  ,keto,cefp9e8,4,t5_2rske

30464,0,t3_1ugpy0,Check out rketogains for lifting on this diet. Keto is muscle sparing it probably the best way to loose weight and not loose lean mass just make just make sure you hit you protein goal and dont go over.  deficit means your eating  less calories then is required to maintain your current weight. For raw whole foods get a kitchen scale if you want accuracy. Use google to find the nutritional  info for a given item then figure out how much you are eating either by estimating or weighing. Packaged products have info on them and serving sizes just multiply the info by how many servings you are eating. Myfitnesspal has a site and phone app that can help track your intake...careful and double check since its not always accurate.  The app can scan food package bar codes to quickly enter items. Last tip we count NET carbs so subtract and fiber from the total carbs keep it under .     ,keto,cehwf6t,3,t5_2rske

By not being in ketosis they continued to require a greater amount of glucose for energy and without enough coming from their diet they difference needed to be made up by muscle protein. So calorie restriction without keto burns through more muscle mass than calorie restriction with keto.

There are studies done on the effects and mechanisms of Keto but none that I have read deal specifically with water.

97061,0,t1_cepepl1,It is cynical because I have not seen a large group of vegans doing it long term with great health results. Often when they fail and decide to eat meat again many of the health problems they had creeping up on them disappear.It is a common story you see on many vegan boards run into health problems because a lack of certain vitamins that are most easily found in meat some people have trouble with converting nutrients etc. but are told they should continue on with the vegan lifestyle for health reasons IMO one should not include morality in a list of causes for health they are not interchangeable so I wont argue with someone who does veganism for morality thats their choice.All Im saying is there is a larger group of people doing well on mostly fat vs those doing well without meat especially with how big the paleo movement is. Not that a epidemiological study like that would prove anything either way but rather that the general change in health for people most improved health due to diet sort of thing would seem anecdotally to fall to the meat eating side by eliminating carbs.,keto,cepham3,2,t5_2rske

Just like Atkins is considered a ketogenic diet but you actually are encouraged to have more healthy carbs after your induction phase.  Its the reason Atkins is considered ketogenic and is also used to treat epilepsy by some doctors because of the increase in ketones in the body leading to less seizures.  It doesnt meet many of our keto standards because weight loss is not as rapid but it still is a ketogenic diet. ,keto,ceqarsa,2,t5_2rske

139242,0,t3_1vnxn5,I might be a relative newbie compared some of those who are posting here  years in Feb but these are my insights We are more adaptable than we think  whenever I talk to people about the fact I only eat meat they immediately tell me why they wouldnt be able to do that. I couldnt live without breadfriescokeetc. Before I started regular keto two years ago my three main food groups were pasta Chinese and soft drinks. Meat was boring unless it was drenched in some kind of sauce breaded or both. Fast forward to today and my mainstay is ground beef as in just ground beef though I get chuck steak or ribeyes when I can. Results are important but dont let a results oriented focus deter from the process  Even though in the beginning I tried to start losing weight as a way to exert control over something we really have very little conscious control over how much we weigh as much as the energy balance folks want to say otherwise. Weight control is ultimately a hormonal process so the focus on results could lead to discouragement unless the person is particularly heavy.  You spent decades establishing your bad habits dont expect to fix them overnight  Ive had off and on issues with cravings and emotionalbored eating over the years. Last year I thought I had them beat but some things happened toward the middle of the year that knocked me off the horse pretty bad. For some reason I also wasnt self aware enough to realize what was going on until about  months later. I dont know if once an addict always an addict but at the very least it would be logical to assume that I will be more predisposed to addictive behavior when it comes to carby treats than others. There are two ways to enjoy food in the head and in the body  I dont really even know how to explain it but I would describe it as the difference between stimulation and satisfaction. A stimulating food would be one high in sugar  it excites us and its novel but it doesnt do anything for us when the experience is over. Every one of my meals now is purely satisfying  it doesnt provide any novelty or excitement but I enjoy every bite of the meal and it leaves me feeling great afterwards. Regular keto gets closer to this mark compared to SAD but its still a little too stimulative for my liking. I guess you have to find some way to get vegetables to be edible.  Cravings are generally the result of not eating enough food or eating too many carbs  I was actually only regular keto for about eight months. Even though I felt MUCH better on regular keto compared to my high carb way of eating it definitely wasnt ideal. I could never get my electrolyte imbalance issue fixed and I always had cravings. I tried giving into those cravings with keto friendly stuff like dark chocolate artificial sweeteners and Atkins bars I dont think anyone thinks these are actually keto friendly but I figured hey theyre low in carbs.. but the cravings never stopped. I held on for quite a while because I was still losing weight but lets just say I didnt get to my goal weight gracefully or stay there for very long.,keto,ceuaflp,16,t5_2rske

Basically it all started with treating childhood epilepsy. Someone figgered out that kids who havent eaten in a while typically dont have fits but you give them food and they go spaz.    After a while someone tried varying the KINDS of foods they gave them and found that carbohydrates were the main problem with excess protein causing issues on a lesser scale but fat seemed to not interfere with their neurophysiology.    Eventually they figgered out they could still keep these kids well fed AND epilepsyfree for a huge margin of sufferers just by feeding them mostly fat a bit of protein and no carbohydrates.    At some stage ketone bodies were discovered. The thing were STILL not sure of about the protective effect of the ketogenic diet in epilepsy is whether its the ketones doing the rescuing or things simply not going haywire in the first place because of no exogenous glucose sources that their bodies are incapable of dealing with. Either way  it is what it is and it works amazingly well.    Now as to modern day stuff  no being ketogenic isnt the be all and end all of diets. It may not even be important. However Ive seen too many NSVs of pretty much every kind in both anecdotal and scientific testing to simply handwave keto as a fad.    But again  is it the ketones themselves or the avoidance of introducing excess glucose into the system that does it? We may never know in our lifetime but for the sake of things as weI know them Im betting my life on them and so choose to remain a highfat opportunistic carnivore  at least until I discover compelling evidence to the contrary that my lifestyle isnt optimal.    The ketogenic ratio itself is well established as youve discovered. Most people will do well simply by avoiding processed foods and excess starchessugars and never giving mind to ratios and crap like that but others are at the point where they NEED the intervention of being ketogenic to heal or at least stabilise their position so for those people they have to be fairly strict following this    ,keto,cfa2se7,1,t5_2rske

283811,0,t1_cfa64h9,gtEvery time your body breaks down fat into fee fatty acids FFAs for energy there are ketones createdIf by fat youre referring to triglycerides this doesnt create ketones. Ketones are created by breakdown of the fatty acids not triglycerides. Usually the fatty acids are used for energy directly broken down to AcetylCoA that enters the Krebs cycle. So ketosis is actually different than nonketogenic fat metabolism. Ketones are only created when liver glycogen is depleted.,keto,cfa6ivk,3,t5_2rske

I injest a decenthefty amount of sugar substitutes coffee flavorings diet pop a packet of Splenda in my tea Atkins bars that dont have maltitol no more than one a day and Atkins shakes and they dont mess with my keto.

It can take two weeks to get back into deep nutritional ketosis if you cheat strongly enough to put you back into glucose metabolism. You will test keto on a pee strip in a few days but those tests arent testing your actual blood ketone levels which wont come back up to the normal high levels experienced in deep ketosis for a while.

But its interesting they mention that mice who had skin cancer injected into them on a high protein diet saw the cancers grow faster. Well no shit. Protein is the building block of all tissue in the body. I would imagine of the cancer is already there any extra protein you consume would probably be absorbedused by the growth.Im pretty skeptical of this article. It makes it sounds like if you eat high protein  you will get cancer. Which I doubt.  If you already have cancer high protein could help it build faster. I mean they even blamed your body producing growth hormone as a reason for increased cancer... IDK. Study seems a little biased.,keto,cfum63w,14,t5_2rske
478255,0,t3_1zl3cl,Read this and remember it If you examine the food they feed the rodents their high fatlow carb feed is always high in carbs as well. It is just lower in carbs than the other groups so they call it low carb but it really is not low carb. Its high carb. So what is happening? The rodents are getting from a keto perspective a high fat high carb diet and that leads to bad health. They NEVER really use a low carb chow for the rodents. Got it? They are calling it a low carb diet but that is just an instudy relationship side by side. The real analysis of the chow will show that even the low carb rodent chow is high carb. When that is added to high fat you get sick rodents. The fundamental dynamic of keto and low carbing is actual LOW carbs. Not high carb called low carb.   So... their research actually shows that high carbs and high fat is not healthy. ,keto,cfumpkk,1,t5_2rske

You just have to draw the line somewhere because somebody is always going to know better than you and tell you what you should or shouldnt be putting into your own body.item not time,keto,cg6jun8,1,t5_2rske

661224,0,t1_cgfcqvr,It depends on the specific cuts but some are really high.  Just lamb ribs for example are .g fat and .g protein per rib.  Thats  calories from fat.  If youre eating boneless skinless chicken breast it wont be anything near that high.  These two also chose cheaper and fattier cuts of meat on purpose because they knew from experience that those were the best tasting and most satisfying.  They would eat the internal organs and internal fat surrounding those organs and bone marrow almost pure fat as well.  They record chewing on the soft ends of the bones.  This probably seems odd especially to a vegetarian but its not.  Who doesnt chew on the bones of chicken wings for example.They would cook their meat with all the fat and dip it into the fat drippings while they ate.  Or they would boil the meat fat and all and drink the broth as well getting all that fat back in that melted off. The good fatty cuts are not as popular these days people want all the fat trimmed off but they are out there.I tend to eat mostly fatty cuts of meat myself and find that my cuts average about  fat or higher but I suspect that is not really correct.  Most nutrition information that I find seems to assume that most large visible clumps of fat are removed left on the plate or otherwise not consumed.  It also seems to assume that the fat that comes off during cooking is not consumed.  Bacon for example  calories a slice and  from fat when pan fried?  Sure but theres also a thousand calories or more per pound that is rendered off.  The nutrition information assumes that is not consumed.  I save that and add it back to other dishes.Bone marrow is OMG good BTW.,keto,cgffiqz,2,t5_2rske

684646,1,t1_cgi33qm,Adipose tissue also processes glycogen when there is insulin present in the blood but it is turned into fat. The liver cant do it all. The liver is the only organ that can synthesise glucose in measurable quantities and thus it regulates your blood sugar by releasing stored glycogen into the blood when your blood sugar is low. I dont know how either of the points you made are relevant. Reduced insulin production is one of the reasons keto works so well. Insulin production interacts heavily with leptin which controls hunger. Low glycemic load diets have been shown to increase weight loss with equal caloric intake. Why is that if insulin doesnt matter?,keto,cgi3fyo,3,t5_2rske

693947,0,t3_2244nq,dont worry about having protein be  of total calories. Keto is not caused by caloric ratios but by amounts of stuff.  Generally you want about .g of protein per pound of lean body mass.  For women protein needs can be higher depending on cycles breastfeeding pregnancy and stuff like that.  Generally i would say for women anywhere from around . to .g per pound of lean body mass would be perfect assuming no pregnancy or breastfeeding.Forgive me for assuming but Id bet youre around  bf Im assuming this based on nothing... so youve got about  lean mass so youre protein needs fall between .  .    g and .  .    g.Basically you can probably eat quite a bit more protein with no concern.

People on a ketogenic diet build muscle just as quickly as people doing a dirty bulk. Check out a TKD. You can build muscle with minimal fat gain. A bulk cycle wouldnt be faster especially because you get  more months of building muscle instead of cutting. There will be an initial drop with glycogen loss but if she continues eating big then shell gain it back within a month likely from muscle growth instead of fat gain.The mental aspects are so strong on keto. Its really insane. You finally can feel normal and energetic and alive. Yeah I started around  or so bodyfat  months ago and have only exercised once a week for about  months and in the meantime Ive got myself down to  bodyfat just from mirror appearance without any starvation and drinking alcohol about twice a week only  drinks. Its a lifestyle that promotes leanness very easily as long as its easy for you to avoid carbs which the cravings go down a ton after adaptation. So it works itself out.,keto,cgsf6hq,1,t5_2rske

Salt pepper cook at  until it shreds easily with a fork  hours depending on the size. After its done I have a ton of pulled pork ready to use in various recipes or freeze for later use.Mexican Add garlic powder cumin chile pepper. Maybe salsa or green chiles if I feel like it. Make a taco salad with the seasoned pork lettuce cheese sour cream and avocado. Or use it as an omelet filling.Asian add garlic ginger green onions sesame oil rice wine vinegar soy sauce red pepper flakes. Toss with a little broccoli broccoli slaw or cabbage. BBQ mix in lowsugar BBQ sauce I make my own and serve with a low sugar cole slaw also make my own dressing for thisThere are a ton of recipes for leftover pulled pork that can be easily adapted to keto. All sandwich recipes can be lettuce wraps or omelet filling. Italian recipes can be served over spaghetti squash or zoodles. Asian can be served over cauliflower rice.

I was vegan for  months. Around thanksgiving break I went home to visit my family and fell off the vegan train for a week. Hopped back on. Then come christmas break I was at my parents for a few weeks and just could not eat vegan while I was there. There were very little options for me as my friends were all unhealthy eaters carbs up the wazoox infinity and kind of fell back into old habits. My parents were against veganism and were really fighting it. When I finally got home I felt that I had taken so many steps in the wrong directionlost  pounds from eating vegan then gained back  I just got really discouraged and didnt go back to veganism. I think I tried to start again but gave up soon after. I honestly missed meat. Especially fish and shrimp... Crab... droolsIm really hoping Keto is the thing for me. Even when I do see my parents again I feel like its something I could keep up instead of going back to eating the way I was eating. I could seriously eat an entire loaf of bread back then.

943949,0,t3_24x8mr,Ketostix are intended for indicating diabetic ketoacidosis which occurs in people who have insufficient insulin production to regulate the normal levels of glucose and ketones in the blood generally Type  diabetics though insulin dependent Type s are also susceptible.In this state the blood becomes acidic due to the unchecked levels of ketones and glucose contributes too I think. Both glucose and ketones are dumped into urine in attempt to flush them out. So then you get dehydrated and the blood is even more acidic. Im actually not entirely sure what effects acidity of the blood has but this is a dangerous condition.So as long as your pancreas works you dont have to worry.EditSorry I didnt explain like youre .When your pancreas breaks and doesnt produce enough insulin your body cant regulate your glucose and ketone levels your blood. This is extremely dangerous but you dont have to worry if your pancreas works good.Well theres also achoholic ketoacidosis you can look into that on the same wikipedia page.Now plain old ketosis means your body is burning mainly fat for fuel because youre not eating carbs and your glycogen stored carbs  water stores are empty. Ketones are used for energy youll be producing more of them as efficiently as the body can it gets better when you are fully keto adapted and excess ketones are peed out. You might test with ketostix to determine whether or not you have excess ketones because that usually implies you are in ketosis.If the body is really efficient with its ketone usage you dont get a lot of excess ketones in your pee so you might still be in ketosis even if the strips do not indicate it.In general darker colours dont necessarily mean youre in deeper ketosis it usually means youre dehydrated or that youre not very efficient with using ketones yet.We are using the ketones for energy and they arent running rampant like with ketoacidosis so its not dangerous.,keto,chbl0pg,2,t5_2rske

I have bought them multiple times and they dont seem to have any negative effects for me with regard to staying in ketosis.  YOu have to figure that the total weight for a bagel is g.  I have weighed the ones I ordered in the past and they are pretty accurate.  With that said they have a lot of high fiber ingredients on their label.  If the FDA order is followed this means that almond flour is pretty far down on total content.  Vital Wheat Gluten is number  but that can vary on carb count depending on where they are getting it.  Oat fiber is  net carb if they are using supplemental form.  Flax is  net as well.g would be a little under  cup of all of those ingredients combined and we dont know what ratio they are being used in.  If we assume that they are all about equal which they might be then you can probably assume no more than about g net carb per bagel at the high end.That is good enough for me on this one.  Even if it is slightly high due to rounding say  g net rather than  they are still more than low enough to fit into my macros.As for taste they definately have a chew to them.  Not a perfect bagel replica but not bad way better than julian.  Their bread is also a little chewy but combined with dixie diner carb not beanit butter and no sugar preserves I can make a g estimated net carb PBampJ that is really good.I get my supply from netrition.com,keto,chcc6n4,1,t5_2rske

976165,0,t1_chf3qac,Its not just when first adapting to keto. Its just based on all the biological processes of how building muscle is more beneficial to both health and a good looking body. Even girls should lift heavy to look goodIn general easy terms all fat loss comes from negative energy balance. Both cardio and resistance training lifting use energy. However because of the higher intensity of lifting it not only uses more energy during it causes hormones to be released that continue burning calories after you stop the activity. Only HIIT sprinting can do that in cardio and at that point the high intensity resistance of HIIT shouldnt be considered cardio which by the cultural view of cardio is keeping your heart rate up for extended periods of time. Irisin in the name of one of the hormones thats the exercise hormone. On top of that cardio doesnt necessarily build muscle cycling is the exception here and building muscle increases your resting meatbolic rate over the long run. That means you burn more calories sitting on your ass so its easier to burn off your fat. We argue diet gt lifting gt cardio because it works like this changing to a good diet is like getting an inheritance lifting is like investing and cardio is like your day job. You can combine all three with great results but its better to put more effort into those which will yield the best results. ,keto,chf8ytm,1,t5_2rske

Hell I could take Plexus eat at a deficit and lose more weight than this!Keto and eating this way probably is healthier than the diet you were following before assumingIf you were on a diet before.Any diet requires a caloric deficit. Keto makes it easier as it regulates your hormones mainly insulin keeping blood sugar levels stable giving you a constant influx of energy and helps manage hunger which will make the diet easier to stick to.Did you actually calculate your required calories? How much are you eating?gt I guess its noteworthy that Im lifting heavy  daysweek.  I know I shouldnt worry so much about the scale given that fact but my clothes arent fitting much better either.Have you measured your body? What lifting program are you following?

The biggest thing to do is read the FAQ. High fat adequate protein low carb. Tracking calories will help on the specifics of foods. Pay attention to electrolytes and water for cramps.  General dieting problems. The biggest problems are the same when starting to make any kind of lifestyle change. If you want to you can get anywhere with this diet. Make sure to update your goals as you go on too.There are more and more keto friendly recipe sites like the ones in the sidebar personally like CavemanKeto. See also rketorecipes for some more interesting ideas. Staple foods usually are things like eggs bacon avocado fatty meatscuts. You can use green leafy veggies like spinachbroccoli for electrolytes. Otherwise supplement if needed.If you can try to offload anything you have onto other friendsfamily so it doesnt get wasted. Keep what you can but anything you can do to make cheating difficult when youre starting out helps.If you want to be a bit more... firm when you get to a goal weight look into rketogains for general workout advice on keto.

1017619,0,t3_25r6zz,From what Ive read the excess skin you have will eventually even itself out. It may take some time though maybe a year maybe  or . I think working out will definitely expedite that process.Ive been overweighfat twice now xD. The first time was at the end of senior high school I got fed up with being fat and went from  to ish. Now I live in Japan and I got a little carried away with the super highcarb foods delicious as they may be and packed on a good lb over the span of  months. Crazy and very discouraging.This is the route I tooktake it works for me. Start off with very slow and steady cardio. You may be lb but your heart and your muscles need to catch up to your new body. You can start off jogging very slowly on the treadmill. You dont want to run too fast because youll stress out your heart and muscles and youll get fatigued much faster. Dont walk though because then it isnt really much of a work out. It should be  notch up from fast walking. Enough that you have a bit of skip with every foot forward. Now if you do that consistently every time you work out or when you wake up or when your bored then we will be seeing lots of progress! Thats cardio. As your jogging gets easier you can up your pace and you can extend your run. For someone just starting out a  minute jog is good for the first week or two at the most after that aim for a  minute jog. Raise the bar every week. Eventually youll be able to run for an hour or two and itll be easy.When it comes down to weights I recommend doing your research on the various types of exercises you can do. Weight liftingtraining is a very focused activity. Whatever exercise you choose to do youre working a specific part of your body. With running the main goal is to work your cardiovascular system primarily your heart but with weight lifting you focus on a muscle group. Each day at the gym should be a different muscle group. For example Mondays are Biceps and Triceps Wednesdays are Calf Quads legs in general Friday is Back and shoulders and Saturday is Chest. Mix it up however you like. I dont recommend doing every muscle group in one sitting at the gym its just too much stress on your muscles. They wont heal evenly. See your muscles get stronger when youre not working out. When youre sleeping they refine themselves so that the next workout theyre more prepared. Of course this bring us to the classic saying no pain no gain you need to feel pain when youre working out your muscles this applies to cardio too. Without pain then there is no indicator that your muscles are being challenged. So dont be afraid to feel sore instead crave it!Bring an mp playeripod with you to the gym or for your runs. Load it with the best and most motivational music you have. Drown out the outside world and just focus on you and your workout.,keto,chjykxt,1,t5_2rske

It activates the carnitine acyltransferase system through inhibition of malonylCoA synthesis. Fatty acid oxidation is increased and ketogenesis enhanced. The overall effect on the liver depends on the relative amounts of insulin and glucagon present. Studies with somatostatin show that glucagon can increase ketogenesis acutely when insulin secretion is inhibited in normal man but the effects are shortlived ,keto,chnftbu,1,t5_2rske

1097768,0,t3_26omt7,Keto is not a diet its called just eating food and more clearly its food as fuel.  In America and many other countries now weve moved away from a food culture and into a foodproduct culture.  Processed foods are a major issue as is the casual consumption of too much sugar in foods where it never existed years ago.  I imagine how people ate  years ago where they only had raw ingredients on the family farm and sugar was a luxury for those with more money and access to trade routes.  As I write this Im sitting in a Starbucks the bastion of chemicals and sugar and I see people eating g sugary drinks for breakfast...,keto,cht2k0y,4,t5_2rske

I missed my first goal of  because of the fluctuations. I had a sweet tooth issue a few times. But Ive remedied that. Im not exercising. I just started tracking on MFP this week so between that and hopefully starting back up on exercise it should get things moving again.

1099619,0,t3_26os4o,First a reminder that in the US we deal in net carbs. Our carb count includes dietary fiber. I believe Ive seen comments from EU residents that in Europe fibers not included in your carbs on the nutrition information. Just keep in mind you can subtract fiber carbs from total carbohydrates here.Another thing to keep in mind is that DC has four quadrants and when youre looking at addresses or cross streets you should be looking for things in Northwest abbreviated as NW if youre trying to stay near the White House.If you go to the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center Address  Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington DC theres a huge food court with lots of different options that can be ketofied. Its two blocks from the White House.Ollies Trolley is a nice nonchain restaurant to visit. They have excellent charbroiled sandwiches that you can simply order without the bun. Its at the corner of th St. and E St. NW Their burgers are what they claim makes them famous but Ive always been partial to their chicken sandwich hold the bun with a slice of American cheese.Theres a Fogo de Chao on Pennsylvania Ave between th and th Streets NW This is an allyoucaneat salad bar and Brazillianstyle slowcooked meat. Its pricey and with the amount youll eat itll be at the higher end of kicking you out of ketosis but man its so delicious! I like to primarily eat fresh mozzarella with beefsteak tomatoes and creamy caesar dressing from their salad bar and then a large portion of the  different meats that you have access to. If youre considering checking this out definitely educate yourself on their website first so you feel a little less lost and can enjoy your experience.You can make up for the money you spent at Fogo by eating street vendor food. Although a bit pricer near the White House tourist part of DC you can still get some good hot dogs or half smokes for a decent price at any of the vendors youll see. I highly recommend trying a half smoke. Its a slightly spicy sausage that is a local delicacy.If an American steak is more what youre looking for you could try Old Ebbitt Grill This is a historic grill and oyster bar very close to the White House. There are a ton of keto options there.  th St. NW Washington DCIf youre willing to go outside of the White House area you can take the Metro up to the U Street metro station and try Bens Chili Bowl which is locally famous and President Obama has eaten at. Address  U Street NW Washington DC Tony Chengs Mongolian Restaurant is another favorite of mine. Its an allyoucaneat Mongolian BBQ restaurant. This means you choose all of the raw ingredients for your dish and hand it to the cook who will cook your bowl for you. This keeps things as keto as you want them to be. Last I knew allyoucaneat for .If the weathers nice the local fish market is walkable from the White House. Its a half hour walk from the White House proper but Im assuming youre not going to be in the White House. Maine Avenue Fish Market is located at  Maine Ave SW Washington DC DC  and has several different vendors all selling delicious fresh seafood. Try some Maryland blue crabs while youre there.If youre looking for fast and cheap and dont want to go to the Reagan Building you can go to Potbelly and get a salad. There are several within walking distance of the White House. I like the Wreck Salad Made to order with fresh lettuce blend including romaine and spinach salami roast beef turkey ham swiss cheese blue cheese hardboiled egg cucumbers tomatoes and Buttermilk Ranch dressing. A bit on the higher carb side g  g fiber   net.If youre looking for something different from this location price or food typewise let me know and Ill let you know if I can think of any place serving that type of food.,keto,chta5my,2,t5_2rske

1102724,0,t1_chtiyln,In the purest sense yes.  If you eat only  cal of carbs a day you would lose weight.  The problem is what is cause and what is effect.  People arent fat bc they eat more calories than they burn due to gluttony or weak will they are fat bc they are hungry for more calories than they burn.  They are hungry for more than they need bc their insulin resistant fat cells are skimming calories off the top and essentially eating first.On keto those fat cells never get the signal to start hoovering.  So the entirety of your caloric intake gets used as fuel and you feel less hungry.  And furthermore in the heavy there is a signaling system telling the rest of the body hey weve got these fat stores we dont need to get as hungry.So you want to reduce the energy in versus out.  But doing it by will power is miserable doing it by controlling the composition of your food is easy and enjoyable once you learn the basics of how to do it.,keto,chtmwja,3,t5_2rske

Probably not and forget about mentioning the other side effects on digestive system fatigue etc.If you want to track macros and calories myfitnesspal is the best way to do it.  carbs  protein  fat. But Im closer to  carbs  protein and  fat I bet.My point is this u dont have to count calories you dont have to track macros and hell I have had plenty of cheat days throughout the process.

Find Ghee clarifed butter and use that to saute your spice pastesmeats instead of olive oil.

Anyone who says otherwise has never dealt with it.That said another thing that made me cranky early on was that I had to spend so much more time effort and thought when it came to food. If I was out somewhere and felt hungry there was always food I could eat and I didnt have to give it any thoughtI just bought something tasty and ate it.On keto? Seems like goddamned everything is a massive sugarcarb bomb. Jeez Louiseno wonder people are so fat now. There are places where there is virtually no food I can eat or if there is I have to throw away part of it bread croutons sugary dressing. Im used to dealing with that now and no longer mind having to cook all my own food or eat before an event or take along something I can eat. But keto ends up drastically changing your lifestyle when it comes to food and that on top of the cravings for carby sugary junk made me really cranky at the beginning.I dont remember how long it took to finally get past all the cravingsthree weeks or so?

The primary loss is water  youre eating muscle after all and its the water that will be the greatest contributor to weight cookoff. Some people say they weigh after because they dont want to count calories they dont eat but theyre eating almost as many calories just in a denser less saturated piece of meat.

For that matter are you not tracking your protein intake and calories either?  How do you know youre getting enough or that you arent getting too much if you arent tracking?  Whats your plan for after you hit your goal weight on keto?  Never touch carbs again?  Personally I think its smart to get in the habit of tracking everything.  Relying on satiety alone can work for a while for some people but its less likely to work as you get leaner and it wont teach you good habits for maintenance like careful tracking will.  ,keto,cint6a8,3,t5_2rske

He started me on mg fosinopril with a diuretic and I didnt do well at all.  Then he took me off the diuretic and that seemed better.  My Doctors office reading was  at  pounds on that medication.  Then he wanted to reduce the medication and switched me to mg Benicar supposedly half as strong as previous medication.  I was on that for two days and was nearly fainting as my BP dipped to .

Thats not to say that humans cant survive on being vegetarian or that there arent any justifiable reasons to eat that way.Its just that were omnivores and many features and adaptations of our bodies are a result of that.  Were able to subsist on a wide range of foods. We lack a lot of the physiological adaptations seen in species with specialized diets or rather were adapted as if were in between carnivores and herbivores.  For e.g. carnivores have super sharp teeth for cutting and chewing flesh while herbivores tend to have flatter teeth and more molars for grinding vegetation we humans have teeth that are a mix of both and we can chew off steak and grind spinach leaves.   Also our stomachs and intestines are meant for meat since herbivores tend to have larger stomachs and much much longer intestines which are needed to extract maximum nutrients from the nutritionallylow foliage that herbivores eat.Bottom line humans are meant to eat meat and plants  our bodies were shaped to accommodate such a diet.  Its no surprise that going vegetarian puts a body out of whack.,keto,civbk91,6,t5_2rske

1430472,0,t3_2ahbxg,Hello there.  You and I are both middleaged women trying to lose fat.A  deficit is too low IMO.  You and I have enough fat to have a much higher deficit.  Try at least  and see how you do Im doing  or sometimes more depending on hunger.  If you do choose a higher deficit be sure to go a bit beyond g protein  maybe g if still sedentary a bit more if you are lightly active  say g max.  Try it.So all you have to do is continue on with the g carbs get used to that eat  calories of protein daily and then work out how much fat you need not to be hungry I eat about g a day  is my max  so about half of what the calculator says I am aware that I always have g of fat I could add if I were actually hungry  Im not.I hope that helps.  You can bring your calories down to  and not feel hungry Im sure of it.  Just get your protein  that leaves you plenty of calories for fat dispense it throughout the day if need be.As you become more keto adapted at least I think this is my experience the fats youre burning stabilize in the bloodstream and it doesnt matter so much when you eat your fats not as much need to supplement with fatladen items.  But have some on handin your mind just in case for the first couple of months.  At a  deficit theres little margin for error and at best youd lose about  of a pound per week  thats very slow and discouraging weight loss.  . lbs per month?  Is that what youre really aiming for?  I did those calcs in my head but I think Im close.  At a  calorie deficit thats one pound per week larger people like ourselves can afford to lose faster than that.  Dont worry about being hungry!

So with one glass milk and one of those fruits youre at around g of carb probably okay with keto but then you have to give up all your vegetables and the micronutrients they contain in order to eat the relatively empty calories of the milk and fruit. Just what do you think youre getting from the milk and fruit thats helpful to your body?  Id have to drink a lot of milk to get enough calcium so I just take a supplement and eat cheese which is much lower in carbs  as in  for the ones I eat since I made the switch from yogurt to cheese  and yogurt is lower in carbs than whole milk or any milk I get more calcium and am losing weight.Im not sure how many more ways you can find to ask the question about fruits but the FAQ and the advice here is pretty clear.  If you feel its necessary to eat g of carbs a day be very careful about calling it keto or expecting the fat burning benefits of keto.  Your body is very likely to remain adapted to sugar instead.  ,keto,ciy9wy6,3,t5_2rske

1525237,0,t1_cj7gdlf,Ive seen the video before and Ive read Lustigs other work before.  And for a lot of what he says I just dont buy it because it simply clashes with so much of the information we have in the field of nutritional science.  I see people every day that lose weight on high carb diets and you can find plenty of controlled trials where people lost weight on high carb diets.  You can also find controlled studies where people lost an equal amount of weight on high carb diets as they did on low carb diets suggesting theres no metabolic advantage to a ketogenic diet.  Whats absolutely clear is that ketogenic and low carb diets are far from the only way to lose fat.But with all of that said Im really not trying to bash keto diets.  I follow one myself and obviously I think there are advantages to such a diet.  I just dont buy into the notion that they work because theyre somehow magical or because carbs such as sugar are evil or toxic.  There are plenty of advantages to ketogenic diets on the merits and theres no need to make up bullshit like carbs are toxic to justify ketogenic diets.  As you point out you were able to lose a significant amount of weight great job btw just by relying on the satiating nature of a ketogenic diet.  Thats an awesome advantage to these diets.  Of course the downside is that ketogenic diets are also very restrictive and not everyone does well with restrictions but the most important aspect of weight loss is finding what works for you and it seems youve done that.  The only reason I speak up in threads like this is because I think its important to understand how and why the diet worked for you i.e. satiating foods allowing you to effortlessly create a caloric deficit because that knowledge is important for keeping the weight off again.  An irrational fear of carbs is just setting yourself up for failure in my opinion because then the only way you know how to lose or keep weight off is to eliminate carbs yet thats far from the only way to control your body composition.  Youre better off understanding carbohydrates and their pros and cons so that youre better prepared if and when carbs are reintroduced into your diet.,keto,cj7grnn,1,t5_2rske

Note if you dont experience rapid weight loss in this period do not despair.

Relax PISS is both normal and temporary.gtFully ketoadapted After  weeks the body is burning fat as its main fuel and the brain has switched to running on ketones. A bumpy downward trend in your weight will begin. The trend is bumpy because there will be days or weeks when your weight stalls or even goes up slightly. This happens to everyone on every kind of weightloss diet. Please dont post to rketo that you gained a pound or two or plateaued for a week. The trend will be especially bumpy if you are female.

1561980,0,t3_2c4ri2, calories for a week is about th of a pound  or  ounces on your scale.  Thats easily offset by minor shifts in water or food passing through your body.And frankly the tape measure isnt going to show much with a  pound weight loss.  So after a month you could expect one pound again easily offset by a womans monthly cycles by water retention due to weather or any number of other fators.You have two choices.  Accept the deficit youre eating and realize that it will be  months before you lose  pounds at this weight at which point the scale should show it!  OR increase your deficit.  If you want  pound a week you must have a  calorie per day deficit.  If you weigh as much as I do you can afford that deficit and once you are ketoadapted a few weeks from now  about week  for most people your body will have plenty of fuel and youll be burning your own fat as fuel.  If youre not as heavy as some of us the weight will not come off as easily and its harder to run a larger deficit.For most people  calories per day  calories a week or one pound is a reasonably fast way to lose weight and anything above  pound per week is reason for great rejoicing if a person eats a slightly higher deficit and then doesnt eat back exercise calories . a week is not unreasonable for a larger person.  ,keto,cjc2f93,1,t5_2rske

The huge weight drop for a lot but not all of people starting keto is due to water weight bound up in glycogen stores then comes the more steadyish weight loss.We arent machines and arent completely efficient at burning calories so you probably wont see a linear drop in weight as time passesyoull stall for a few days and start seeing the scale go down.  The longer youve been losing weight and the closer you come to your goal weight the longer those little stallsplateaus will be which is completely normal.

1761785,0,t1_ck0mi0r,gtHumans can definitely gain weight on keto. It is more difficult due to satiety. But fat goes into cells even in spite of low insulin levels because of acylation stimulating protein ASP  . This means with excess calories you gain weight.No that means that with sustained excess fat you gain weight. ASP is only stimulated by Chylomicrons in response the fat in your diet. The difference here is that Chylomicrons do not stay active as long as Insulin does They get sent to the liver and converted to VLDL rather quickly once they become remnant then the VLDL is sent out to be used as energy. As such Fat wont lock fat in your fat cells for long after a meal... especially since Glucagon is rampaging through your system which slows the process down greatly and frees fatty acids from your fat cells.Fat cells themselves also have a feedback mechanism. As you eat more Fat your intestines create Chylomicrons which stimulate ASP to be created in the fat cells. ASP then signals the fat cell to start pulling in fat from the blood stream. As the fat cell gets fatter it sends a signal to the brain in the form of Leptin. The Brain then suppresses hunger. Those Chylomicrons then become remnant pass to the liver are converted to VLDL and sent throughout the body to be used as energy. ASP is not stimulated by VLDL so as soon as the Chylomicrons are converted to VLDL ASP production goes down and fat is free to move in and out of your fat cells.You would have to power through satiety and sustain  fat intake for a very long time before fat will make your fat cells fat and keep it there essentially youll need to sustain a presence of Chylomicrons in your blood stream. In reality though that would never happen unless you have an underlying condition ie. Leptin production isnt present in fat cells or other underlying conditions.If you think about it this evolved brilliantly. You eat fat some of it gets stored. During storage your fat cells release Leptin which signals your brain that youre full the fat cell doesnt want to store too much fat. Once you stop eating The fat you eat gets converted quickly into VLDL in order for it to be used as energy throughout your body. Once VLDL is used up you  get hungry again and the process starts all over again. ,keto,ck18a7q,3,t5_2rske

1869879,0,t1_ckeic16,Exact numbers arent important. The reason to track is just for something concrete and then adjusting. Generally as you lose weight you drop fat and maintain protein. If you increase deficit you want to raise protein slightly and drop fat more. So in your case if youre eating g of protein and g of fat not taking into consideration total calories or calories burnt or anything else like exercise for simplicity sake and youre stalling first youd drop fat by g and if youre still stalling after  weeks drop fat another g and raise protein g.  of the time that does the trick. There will be the initial water weight stall from increased glycogenwater from the increased protein but thats not something to freak out about. Most of the time youll either get back into a steady loss or whoosh. So Id definitely recommend at least raising protein to g and to compensate for calories drop fat by g and consider those your new macros.,keto,ckeiiak,1,t5_2rske

There are different triggers for ketosis  starvation is one of them but not the only one. Nutritional diabetic alcoholic etc. If you dont want to do keto there is no reason you need to. Its not unsafe but if you just dont want to do it then tell your boyfriend that. You dont have to lose weight the same way.  I would like to emphasize again that keto causes no damage to your body and please dont perpetuate that myth. Im not sure what perspective youre looking for. I dont know what sources you have read but ketosis is not harmful.  Why would hundreds of people sign on to something and continue to do it for months and years if it was causing damage? Moreover where is the evidence that it causes damage? Youre asking if it does and if it did youd think you would have read something about said damage. A great book is The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living. You also might browse eatingacademyblog.com or this site both from physicians who advocate keto.  There is plenty of research about keto you can start with rketoscience.  I personally have been on keto for  years and Im thriving and not causing any damage to my body in fact have never been in better health. If youre unsure then dont participate.

Youll also lose weight and it is supereasy.And Im not obese. My BF has been  for  years now while being  years on a raw paleo low carbs diet. Ive never counted calories. BMI of . whatever that means Other health markers are good. Rock climbing yoga surfing. My high carbs friends cant keep up with me.  I dont see why this matters but there you go.And yes look at other cultures. And at the history. And if you want to do simple comparisonsWhy is  of the US population overweight or obese and in France to pick some other country only ?Is it because Americans eat unbalanced? Because they dont have willpower? Because they dont eat carbs in moderation?And to put some more on the fire. I think that the establishment dodging these questions and putting op smokescreens is actually pretty evil. Id like all of them to tell the kids with fat liver disease and obesity they should drink coke only in moderation. And I think it is a good thingtm that some countries are trying to change things.

There are plenty of articles on the internet that the first major weight loss event is golden and may happen fairly quickly and easily.  It may just be attributable to a person doing it exactly correct as mentioned but it also may be your bodys natural attempt at obtaining a normal weight while still young.  I believe that when you yoyo diet it confuses your body and metabolism and it takes longer to reset these levels on future attempts.  It doesnt mean that it cant be done.

When you are already within a normal weight range it really is less about the scale and more about how you look. In  months you may not hit the scale goal but with good diet and weight lifting you can accomplish A LOT as far as what you fit into and how good you look naked which I assume is on everybodys wish list.My advice is toss the scale hit an adequate deficit kcal and get into the gym and start working your muscles.Even with my slower weight loss Im still seeing weekly changes in my belt and muscle definition.,keto,clgk2bj,1,t5_2rske

2189796,0,t3_2k5dpz,Infants start life in ketosis.You dont need a whole culture to study keto.  BTW not everyone here is a European.  Some of us have very different genes than Europeans I could be Inuit or Athabaskan or descended from Siberian tribes for all you know  or some of the low carb eating Native American groups.  How long do you want them to be in ketosis to prove its normal?  What if its  of the year youre forgetting that the Inuit ate mostall of those carbs within a limited period of time.    If a group of people lived for generations or centuries eating  ketosis and  nonketosis would that be proof for you of adaptation?  What are your academic credentials here because its a complex question for some person who has merely read a few things about the Inuit to decide.In other words different cultures at different times of year have  and still do  practice a ketotic diet.  Its very common.  Maybe theres a reason.  Lots of bona fide research on this topic whole textbooks many journal articles.My own ancestors practiced ketosis during long ocean voyages.  They started out from Formosa about BP.  But you could also read about the Juhuansi Im also part African who go for  months of the year eating only insects and marula nuts.  Its less than g carbs a day.  Women still have breast milk children have a low rate of birth defects despite ketosis for more than the  months just described  as well as days of fasting.  Theres virtually no mental illness.  They are known as extremely well adjusted patient happy people.  The men still practice endurance running and those who are trying to freelive these days still do  and are pretty much in ketosis during the hunting season.Polynesian voyagers fasted and ate dried fish on voyages with some pounded coconut low carb.  Australian aborigines still fast and practice eating only nuts and dried meat during trekking season.  Shoshone today still eat mostly protein and fat even though they are on ranches  and they are a group of Native Americans not possessed of a common NA trait  which is obesity.So for me it seems healthy.  Youd be surprised how many people have genes that seem to favor ketosis  but it is probably not everyone.  Myself Ive been studying European dining habits since childhood my dad is French now FrancoAmerican.  There are lot of very low carb eaters  Id have to follow them around a lot to determine whether what they tell me about their diets is true but I tend to believe them based on observation and many days spent together where there is no reason to think they were changing their habits away from proteinfatlow carb to another diet.Read about the Mediterranean Diet  not quiet keto but many people on that bell curve shade into ketosis.  ,keto,cli6d8z,2,t5_2rske

Order steak order wings if youre at a pizza place etc you have more options there.For me its all about the cost benefit. The longer I do keto the less it seems worth to break it for some  minute impulse to Eat a Bad Thing. Impulses pass. Also... do your family not know youre on keto? Like is it out of the question theyd be supportive? Its equivalent to vegetarianism.

Cook meat of choice Bacon sausage ham turkey chicken Whatever..Mix eggsDepends on how many you make add  tbsp of heavy cream per egg and beat together. Also add seasoning of your choice salt pepper garlic hot sauce etc. Get cheese you can add it to the egg mix or the meat doesnt matter..Get muffin tin spray it down with a cooking sprayoil. Add meatcheese and pour in eggcream mixture.. Cook at F in oven for  to  minutes.These are greats and easy to do you can make a ton on sunday and eat them all week. Also you can add whatever you wantKetofriendly of Course my wife really like spinach in hers but peppers are really good as well. Just an idea for you That works for us.

2363553,0,t3_2mdojw,She doesnt gain weight while eating  calories a day because she has a ridiculously active lifestyle. Both she and her boyfriend ride bikes and run often for hours a day. Of course shell still be thin. People who went on her  calorie a day diet with little or no exercise still gained weight because your body stores excess calories as fat. Fat is very caloriedense so its an efficient way of storing excess energy. Your body does this to save your life in the event that food is scarce along with many other reasons. No matter what you eat this process takes place.I do agree that a lot of people eat too much meat and need to incorporate more plantbased foods in their diets  no offense to the keto community. However freelees extreme diet is a shock value diet that people want to try just because it is so different. A healthy diet requires balance not  bananas a day. She seems to think that fat goes directly into your fat cells but it doesnt. Your body coverts it into acetyl CoA  to be used in cellular respiration the same way your own body fat is used. Vegan diet isnt for me but if anyone is planning to go vegan I strongly recommend consulting with a licensed dietician who is knowledgeable about veganism and the bodys functions. Freelee is so ignorant about so much biology its simply unhealthy to solely follow her advice. For example saying that it was healthy for her to lose her period for almost a year but shes sure she was still ovulating during that time because she felt good. Also claiming that all women can  and are suppose to have a thigh gap playing on young womens insecurities. I would not trust dietary advice from anyone that ignorant about the body. edit  fat is converted to acetyl coenzyme A which is what glucose and fats are converted to before entering the citric acid cycle,keto,cm3ufpr,3,t5_2rske

2381247,0,t3_2mo0hm,There is some confusion around the word diet. The Ketogenic Diet means The stuff you eat to inducemaintain ketosis  not the stuff you eat to lose weight ketogenically.The thing is that obesity is a symptom of metabolic and hormonal craziness. Also diabetes  hypertension  artherosclerosis and a bunch of other stuff. All are symptoms of an underlying condition. To fix this condition you can eat foods which induce and maintain ketosis  essentially very low carb moderate protein. When you fix the underlying metabolic fuckup your whole body gets fixed every cell. Then you use more energy as your basal metabolic rate increases. The food you eat is no longer being shunted into fat storage it is actually being metabolized.Eating crap food screws up your hormonal and metabolic systems. Whilst eating too many calories most people are undernourished. These extra calories cant be used and so the fat piles on. Fixing the underlying issues allows you to metabolize more if not all of your consumption less to store as fat less need to do so more need to metabolize fats as energy.At least this is the picture as I have understood it and it makes sense to me at least ,keto,cm613oq,2,t5_2rske

I discovered too late that the longer you spend in the dark just resting the better your recovery.  Dont skimp on sleep  you might find that you spend longer in a deeper sleep I found it impossible to wake up in the morning  this is important.  I ended up listening to audiobooks on my phone with my eyes closed  this has helped a lot but I wish Id realised it earlier on in my recovery.Im  years on and I still cant go clubbing or even sit in a very brightly lit room.  Anyway as for keto DO NOT jump on and off.  There was a thread around here a while ago about migraines and how the jump on and off sugar nearly always causes a withdrawal migraine.  I feel stronger on keto than I do on carbssugar.  I try and go super high fat when Im trying to recover from a migraine...but your mileage may vary.Whatever you do stick to it  your brain has got enough to cope with without stressing it by moving on and off.

Tell them you dont want riceI do this every time and they dont even bat an eye pick cabbagespinach cauliflower if you like veggies and lots of meat. I often eat at these stalls so I can eat some organ meats like pig liver and intestines. Some stalls also serve roasted pork and theyre usually very good. If youre willing to eat a few carbs I suggest you try the Hainanese roasted chicken rice. You can eat a fully paleoketogenic meal at these places for cheap less than sgd.

Repeat again and youll be burning up for the next  minutes and your body will still feel warm for hours over that.Do this every time you feel like youre freezing and youll never have to feel cold again. Its an old trick Ive learned in the army.Basically if youre losing weight it means your body isnt getting enough energy for heat production. Youve also lost your insulation which means your have to produce more heat than normal. With anaerobic exercise your stimulate muscle growth which also produces a lot of excess heat As a side bonus anaerobic exercise will make your body burn fat for up to  hours after the exercise was performed. Your metabolism will also speed up so dont be afraid to eat a bit more than usual.EDIT Also forgot to mention that even visualising the exercise can have similar benefits.

They want you to enjoy yourself.Just as long as you can stay certain that you will enjoy yourself more without the pizza and you can explain that to them you should be fine.Just as religious and social traditions have changed so will dietary traditions.

Im looking to lose  lbs in  months the bet is at mo with a total return of   profit so next Christmas will have a nice cash bonus.  I would recommend to anyone interested in this to play with the numbers I was seeing anywhere from  returns offered and it became apparent that my profit wouldnt be allowed to exceed  regardless of timelineweightwager then it was just a matter of finding the cheapestshortest wager to net the maximum profit. I signed up for one of the  week challenges at Dietbet. I think Ill sign up for a new challenge every week or two for a while as I expect there to be a lot of dropouts from the resolution crowd. I expect these short challenges to net a bit better during this time of year. You can be in up to six games at a time  each of the  or  week.Edit It looks like HealthyWager gives credit for referrals so I can get some extra cash for anyone that I send their way but only if I meet my weight lose goal.

2750493,0,t3_2ri6vz,I also recommend finding another doctor. There are doctors out there who will be receptive and even encourage dairy and grain free diets and Im sure you should be able to find a gastroenterologist who understands. I have two doctors at the moment who are like this and theyre both adamant that grains and dairy are the devil especially for people who are prone to inflammation and intolerances. Doctors need to understand that its not always the results and the numbers they need to treat. I had trouble getting treatment for my thyroid because the standard tests came back normal but I had inflammation and a tonne of symptoms. Its obvious that I had an underactive thyroid but the tests just arent reflecting that. Most doctors would probably refuse to treat it because the test results didnt show anything but on the other hand if my tests did show problems but I didnt have any symptoms a doctor would claim there was no need to treat. The way so many doctors work is counterintuitive.While scientifically iffy you could also do one of those food intolerance blood tests. I did one on the advice of a dietician after my tests came back as negative for coeliac and grains dairy sugars etc all came up as intolerances. Some doctors will blindly follow tests like that and producing something like that could shut them up about it.It always astounds me when I hear about gastroenterologists especially who appear to be so ignorant towards these types of things. Theyre better positioned to understand the way that grains and dairy can adversely affect the human body. While the impact of these things on the brain is more difficult to quantify and understand there is plenty of indisputable physical evidence of the impact of these things on the gut. I also second keeping a detailed journal. Doctors tend to like that sort of thing.Good luck and I hope you can find some help and a doctor who isnt a jerk,keto,cngpwvj,1,t5_2rske

I eat about kcals to lose weight. The difference kcals is made up from burning fat from my body. The maximum amount of energy my fat stores can release in a day is about kcals per day kcals per lb of fat. Because  is less than the max my fat stores can release I will not go into starvation mode.But if I ate nothing no energy intake my fat catabolism wouldnt cover my required TDEE in which case I would go into starvation mode.Also unclear as you stated if fat cant cover my TDEE muscle and bone would start contributing to the TDEE which leaves the question is starvation mode really when NOTHING can get me to my TDEE?,keto,cnifrrn,2,t5_2rske

However it also takes time to get used to in other ways as in you seem to be focused on chicken breast which dont get me wrong I love the stuff but its likely the reason youre having difficulty meeting your calorie goals  its high protein so satiating and thus why you feel overstuffed but its not high fat and thus creates an issue.

2865836,0,t3_2sxaki,Hi ragdoll are you doing Keto to lose weight or simply to overcome low BG?I was having a really bad time with hyperinsulinemia before I tried Keto. Extremely lethargic would fall asleep and feel light headed and weak. With some monitoring I was able to notice that somewhere around mgdL I would start getting drowsy and from there it would drop to around mgdL at which point I would simply feel awful.I decided to try Keto at first it was good I started feeling more energy but as I went past the first few days I began to feel weakness again and then what felt like constipation. I thought I had maybe eaten something that dropped me out of ketosis. I also got the electrolytes thing but I had been salting everything to taste and eating plenty leafy greens. I was doing strict ltg.My second time I was determined and decided to go stritct ltg. Again I felt good the first few days. Then the nausea and stomach cramping started. It felt like I was constipated. Then I started getting weakness. I was here asking for help and again I got the electrolytes. This time I bought nusalt and was adding plenty to all my water but still no help. It did help with muscle twitch and heart palpitations though. I then read somewhere that fiber may be the cause of constipation in some Keto people so I stopped eating my greens for  days to test it out. At this point Im doing ltg. The first day I felt great. Then the rest were progressively worse. Finally one day when I was really nauseous and feeling constipated I decided to check my BG and it was near mgdL. I brought this info here but many shrugged it off as on Keto your BG tend to be lower. So I decided to rough it out and keep going and hope that after one month I would adapt. Day  rolled around and I woke up at  am super nauseous and heavy stomach cramping. As Im sitting on the toilet I barf. I check my BG after and its mgdL. The lowest its ever been. I decide to take about g of dextrose in a cup of water and go back to sleep. From that day I go back to popcorn and homemade rice milk. Im now eating  multigrain bread and have plenty of energy for my work outs and rarely get drowsy. Unfortunately I want to have the fogfree benefit from Keto. I intend to slowly lower my carbs later on as per another Keto hypoglycemics advice. Anyways hope this is helpful. Feel free to PM me. ,keto,cntuh68,1,t5_2rske

Should we even bother with the Walgreens BS anymore? We have horrible health insurance coverage as of  which is better than the no health insurance we have now  but that will at least allow us to pick a primary physician and get referrals for tests or whatever. Right now I doubt anyone would even see us without insurance  although well be paying out of pocket either way which is no big deal.I would get the NMR profile baseline and then go from there while eating as few carbs for him as possible to start clearing out the garbage.gtI was elated with both sets of results  Im really hoping Genes numbers will completely resolve just through diet change.

2887446,0,t1_cnw188z,And thats exactly my point in a nutshell. Developing a critical mindset and doing your own research to both understand and assess the issues is an essential skill. Doubly so in the case of something as important as your own nutrition. There arent shortcuts to understanding.I could spend the time putting in citations just to have people treating them with the same credulity as I am objecting to in the first place but I dont see how that is going to do anything but encourage the exact problem Im objecting to. Ive put my view out there and people are free to do with that as they will.IMO to understand the ecology of the mouth is to understand the entire problem space. If youve got an idea of whats occurring in the oral cavity then you can make your own conclusions about what the absence of carbs is going to do to that. I understand that people might see that as a cop out. So be it. I dont have anything to prove and Im not interested in exposing myself to death by a thousand cuts from complaints about minutia of rigour and validity of citations. Id rather sit here and enjoy my tea.,keto,cnwb0g4,3,t5_2rske

Some here will think keto is the one true god of weight loss others think calories incalories out is the only thing that matters and keto is just one method of managing that.   Personally I think that for some keto may seem to work more effectively if they find that issues with insulin resistance and blood sugar cause significant decreases in their energy levels resulting in a decrease in their effective calories out. For these types consistent ketosis will affect their weight loss. Does that make sense?,keto,cnxl4yk,3,t5_2rske

2912575,0,t3_2tgs1t,If Im going to a sitdown restaurant I always resort to steak or carnitasfajitas and tell them to hold the breadtortillaschips. I just tell the server that I dont eat sweets and bread. Ive found most people are aware of lowcarb diets now. I get the occasional server that still sends bread which is OK. But if they act funny about it I simply take note of that in my tip. Theyll know not to do that next time.Asking the server for the ingredients in a dish has been a pain. Ive just learned to really eye a dish to know if it might be over my carb count. I generally stay away from saucescreamsgraviessalad dressings encrusted dishes and things that say they have fruit in it. In place I ask for plain sour cream or butter. I dont care that an MFP entry says its lowcarb I avoid these things period. That being said If a dish comes with a sauceglazecreme I always ask for it on the side. Ive even done this at Asian restaurants with success though Ive found Princess Chicken is probably the most ketofriendly Chinese dish without any modifications. I find that this works better than simply saying no sauce please. But somehow put the sauce on the side please seems to register. If a dish has cheese I make sure its cheddar or mozzarella. Not sure why I do this but I dont generally trust cheeses Im not familiar with in fear of being served a lowfat cheese product.Also I find that if a dish requires too many modifications its best not to order it. Sure the wait staff should be accommodating. But to ask the staff to use a special cooking oil and to make sure theres absolutely no flour in the coconut crusted chicken fillet is a stretch. The best I got asking a cook at Western Sizzlin to cook my steak in butter I think they do that anyway but I wanted to make sure.Fast food? I buy hot wings sans sauce though the frying oil is questionable and get burgers without the bunketchup. If the place serves breakfast all day Ive struck gold keto breakfast is pretty easy to acquire. I just watch out for places that use liquid eggs instead of real ones...and those that use pancake batter in their omelets...,keto,cnz61ms,1,t5_2rske

2945515,0,t1_co2uox7,Yes I read that interpretation as well but assuming both actually eat to satiety and not past it the issue is that eating to satiety at lower body fat results in eating at maintenance especially if active. The deficit which can be created by actually eating to satiety is different for people with more body fat. the variation in satiety is much lower than the variation in body weight. Consider two people who eat to satiety they might both eat  calories for example. If person A is  lbs thats a huge deficit and results in weight loss if person B is  lb its a marginal deficit.

My point is just that as a source of carbohydrate potato has pretty damn good nutrient density this is WITHOUT getting into the whole starch as fuel for good gut bacteria deal.gtThere is no need to have carbohydrates unless youre taking intense exercise. Have them all you want but theyre unnecessary.The exercise doesnt even need to be that intense.  Id say most all? high school sports would require a decent ammount of carbs to refuel afterwards.  Yes you can be in ketosis and fuel some pure strength based activities and some endurance activities but anything outside that spectrum is going to need carbohydrate for good performance.Again plenty of very healthylong lived populations the Okinawans spring to mind consume large proportions of carbohydrate.  Is high carbohydrate intake good for everyone?  Obviously not.  Can it cause problems especially amid sedentary people obviously.

3038523,0,t3_2uygu5,The following is just a model to think about this but itll serve our purpose.The key to keto and low carb isnt the carbs but the insulin in our bloodstream.  Any food produces an insulin response but fat produces a minuscule amount protein produces a small amount and carbs produce a large amount.  And in some people generally those who have put on extra weight carbs produce a very very large amount.  see insulin resistanceNow for the sake of this model imagine insulin activates a switch that turns our fat cells to storage mode.  The more insulin the longer our fat cells go into storage mode.  In storage mode they are sucking calories out of our blood and packing them away regardless of whether they could be used anywhere else in our body.  So the body produces insulin in proportion to the carbs we eat which means that the fewer carbs you eat the smaller the amount of insulin released and the shorter the time fat is being stored.  If youre not in fat storage mode those fat cells are free to release calories out to the body as it needs them.Keto is a state where the carb intake is so low the body becomes more efficient at burning fat.  In our model its a situation where the fat cells never go into storage mode and are always releasing calories into the body.Of course to lose weight you have to make sure the calories you consume whatever the source are fewer than the calories you use AKA you need to be at a calorie deficit.  This forces your body to consume stored fat to make up the shortfall.And finally to address a probable followup question keto and low carb works for people bc with out an exaggerated insulin response from carbs the bodys normal mechanisms to control weight function properly.   If you eat only  calories of carbs or only  calories of fat a day youll lose weight.  But eating carbs your body is confused and stores calories it needs away as fat and leaves you tired and hungry.  Eating fat your body is able to recognize you have large reserves stored in your body so you have energy and minimal hunger.  Many people on a keto diet can simply eat as much as they want to and they lose weight.  Some people even on keto need to track calories to stay at deficit.Again this is as accurate as describing a gas as a bunch of little balls bouncing against each other.  Its a first order approximation.  But I think it gives you the answer you want which istldr the fewer the carbs the better keto level carbs is the best.Edit for clarity,keto,cocxws5,8,t5_2rske

3264645,0,t3_2xhqsr,Disclaimer this is all obviously anecdotal. And long. Ive struggled with restricting and then bulimia and hve always had a terrible relationship with foodmy bodyguilt. The behaviors are all recent starting my freshman year of college now a senior. I was mostly recovered read I wasnt really recovered when I started keto. After about a month something crazy happened... I started to love my body. Like really love it. I started being able to walk around my apartment naked and not have to avoid mirrors. I didnt automatically cover my stomach when my boyfriend looked at me Im bed and Id even ask him to touch my stomach !!!!. Im almost crying just thinking about this. Something about keto is so good for my depression... I cant even explain it. Obviously ymmv but it changed my life. And I only lost about  pounds so its not like my body was actually significantly changing my mind was. My ultimate goal is to be at a place where I dont think about what I eat at all but keto really provides such a psychological benefit for me that its worth it. And I dont obsess like I used to despite actively tracking my macros. Like the action of tracking is the same but its guilt free now. I dont hate myself if I mess up. Really I dont! So for me its truly not a manifestation of my ED. I went away from keto for multiple months and while I didnt have the same selflove as on keto I also wasnt suicidal about my food like I was preketo. I ate what I wanted and really didnt feel shame. Finally I dont really post on here so idk if the community is open. But if I see a post I will be supportive. It takes so much to realize that youre at your worst and its so smart to be wary of food tracking. I support you . TLDR its been great for my relationships with my body and food. It could be for you too but do be careful. If you start to associate that awful shame with tracking your macros or anything rethink it. If you start to become upset with yourself for messing up rethink. I think keto can be an awesome recovery and selflove tool but pay attention to yourself which youre obviously already doing!.Sorry this got so long Ive never talked about it before and like I said Ive never loved myself the way that I do on keto so its really important to me. ,keto,cp0ea0l,2,t5_2rske

3280847,0,t1_cp129uf,Well rather than just downvote you like others Ill tell you why it doesnt quite work that way. If you carb up youll probably get  lbs of water weight back really fast. Then youll go back on Keto and youll probably lose  lbs or so and then be back in the same situation you are in. What you are currently struggling with is your body replacing lost fat with water weight a lot of that is the same water weight you lost at the beginning of your diet and made the scale drop so dramatically so the scale is going to net zero to you but you are losing fat. Once that water weight gets maxed out the scale will start going down again. I saw from another comment that you are running at  calories lowering this should speed up the process but it can still take weeks or even months. It sucks man but that just how the cookie crumbles. You havent developed a tolerance for Keto though.,keto,cp28rp2,1,t5_2rske
3282789,0,t3_2xq3jd,I can sympathize.  Most sweeteners are just painfully sweet to me.  Even in small quantities they can be overwhelming.I will mention just in case you didnt know that some sweeteners can have a surprisingly high GI.  Google sweeteners and GI and youll be able to find a chart.  It is further complicated by the fact many granular sweeteners are a mix of different things.  Could you have used a bran with higher GI sweeteners?  If so experiment and essentially pick your poison.That all said if youre having difficulties with dairy try coconut cream and coconut oil.

It appears to be harmless but if not I would be interested in reading about it.

3536347,0,t3_30sfcg,I think it is sound advice just really difficult to  implement for most people. I think most people are not really in tune with what it feels like to have eaten enough. Most will stop when they feel stuffed but not earlier.The concept of fat to satiety is based around treating the  macronutrients of carbs protein and fat as the edges of a triangle. The length of the carbs edge is fixed to approx. g. The length of the protein edge is also fixed but with wider margins for error. So the only way to reduce or increase calories is by expanding the fat edge on the triangle.This is generally sound since caloric intake is closely related to fat gain or loss in most healthy people. And when on keto eating more fat than needed will lead to fat weight being gained. But this cico thinking can come unstuck too. Studies show that body builders on a high protein high calorie diet do not gain fat weight. Studies also show that too little food can result in a slight decrease in total energy expenditure.It is difficult to distill all these nuances for people you dont really know and who are new to both weight loss and niche dieting. The very best advice would be tailor made for the individual requesting it.If I could change the fat to satiety mantra it would be keep fat intake close to your daily goal. Simply because most ketoers are already tracking carbs and protein it cant be that hard to track fats too.,keto,cpvd74w,3,t5_2rske

You adjust garlic and onion and coriander to taste I like my sauce with green little flecks so thats why it has lots of coriander.Some corn oil just because it will cook your sauce nicely so your sauce will be fried not just boiled.Put all ingredients  already cutted in the microwave for  minutes with water or boil it in the stove with a cup of water transfer to blender boil again until it changes color and is more condensed add at this time the oil and cook it some more so it gets fried.Keto tip flax seed makes it slightly more dense like a tbspoon is enough the taste is not altered a lot and you get a fiber bonus.If you have time first fry  the garlic and onion in the oil until one side is golden then blend the onion this way will make your sauce taste sweeter. If you have some chicken stock you use that instead of water it makes it better tastier.See easy it takes ten minutes all fresh ingredients  you just clean one pot and the blender is really Mexican and without hidden carbs. ,keto,cq6bqh2,4,t5_2rske

Norman Borlaug was given a Nobel Prize for solving the impending doom of the planet due to overpopulation.So then there was actually a surplus of grains in producing countries The West TM. Agricultural policy changed around this time subsidies were given to farmers so that they would continue overproducing thus lowering the risk of famine at home and helping to alleviate famine abroad. Anywho by the s and s there was a massive overproduction of wheat  which in the US and the EU is very cheap. Hundreds of billions are spent subsidizing its production. This wheat has got to go somewhere there arent enough cows and pigs to eat it all. So it is turned into starchy sugary and fatty foods all cheap and fed to humans.In actuality better policies could have been implemented but werent   I am not at all suggesting that adopting LCHF would lead to starvation in the developing world times have changed and so has the fundamentals of food security. But now  as Venkman suggested  we have that problem that farmers big agriculture and big food do not want to see those subsidies removed as it would directly harm their ability to profit from the obesity epidemic.My point is back in the day the choice was to subsidize food or risk famine  this with the cold war as a backdrop for peoples thinking. Poor decisions were taken by politicians and by society collectively. But those decisions were not at least not initially cooked up by big food as a way to make profits.

After washingrinsing soap off on my skin still dripping wet skin I apply sweet almond oil got mine for  at GNC all over and let it air dry for a few minutes before patting with a towel. The brush helps to exfoliate off the dead skin and the oil moisturizes the new skin making it soft supple and helps with snap backs.

I dont think you are in water poisoning territory at that amount but drinking plain water in those amounts is going to deplete your body of electrolytes unless you are adding electrolyte supplements to the water you are drinking. Over consuming water causes problems for fit athletes too because of the electrolyte dilution.

The yoyo of a cheat every week or two rarely works longterm and usually results in a cheat every week or two being a cheat multiple times a week. Unlike other diets keto is a complete overhaul of your metabolic state so the common dieters approach of weekly cheat meals doesnt always work very well.  If you want to drink a beer occasionally then you could likely make that work and not necessarily consume that many carbs. If its fast food vs. a nonketo alternative fast food is likely the better choice.  I personally prefer to cook my food but if fast food keeps you on the wagon its fine.  You might consider making your meals ahead of time. ,keto,cqqv1yp,1,t5_2rske

3815193,0,t3_3445tq,Congratulations on deciding to make a change!  Keto may sound scary at first but its actually surprisingly simple.First you need to use the keto calculator in the sidebar.  When you have your calories and macros you need to try an online logger like MFP to see what that comes to.  Do a few sample menus and learn what a day of keto food looks like.Second buy a food scale!  Volume measurements are easy to fudge so a food scale makes it much more reliable and a lot simpler.Third modify your existing meals.  The best keto recipes are the recipes you already know and love.  Most Western style meals are modular and removing the carb is easy and you can add a fatty sauce or extra veg.Fourth research a few new recipes just for variety.  The links in the sidebar are great.  You dont have to be stuck eating boring food on keto.  Sauces and dressings can be very easy but tasty ways of adding flavor.  Learn to make different kinds of ethnic food for even more variety.  For inspiration check out mainstream recipe sties.  They can be easily adapted if need be.  In my experience the changes are generally minor.And of course no post on this sub would be complete without reminding you to get youre electrolytes ,keto,cqr5vh1,2,t5_2rske

3836096,0,t3_34boza,Dairy is insulinogenic meaning it produces an insulin response that is much larger than the sugars in the milk would justify. This study says milk is more insulinogenic than white bread. Combine that with the caloriedense nature of dairy and youve got weight gain or a stall waiting to happen! Some people are more affected by this than others. Id drop the dairy for  weeks and see if weight loss doesnt resume.I for one am sensitive to dairy in this way. A few months back I added daily servings of fullfat unsweetened yogurt to my diet  to  cup. After about a week and a half I had gained four pounds. I was not on keto at this point but theres more. I once lost  pounds simply by cutting dairy out of my diet. Again I was not on keto at that time but dairy is a notorious promoter of body fat and quitting for a while may be an easy way to break a stall.Also if you are female take your monthly cycle into account. Lots of extra water weight can come on and stay on for weeks. ,keto,cqtjr1l,0,t5_2rske

Im not sure how they calculate the minimum calories.  Id say to set the calculator at sedentary and set your deficit at your body fat percentage.

3970021,0,t3_35sy2a, I think i know what can help you out. Thats knowing that there is a keto substitute for almost everything. Breads sweets etc etc. Whenever you have a craving just find the keto sub for it. You can make your own ice cream and pastas etc.    You will ofc have to make most of it yourself but you will also be able to customize it better. You can make batches and freeze them.Im going to start a food youtube channel so Im currently obsessed with ketofying recipes. I think the easiest and best thing to do when starting keto is to make a giant list. Make sections for the types of food you like. Meat veggies etc. A section for food when out a section for food when in a hurry. Recipes and items you want to try. Just write it all down. This will help with the what do i eat feeling that leads to cheating.This will also get all the info swimming in your mind out so it wont overwhelm you. I suggest also subbing to ketorecipes and making a pinterest. This helped me get excited for keto.When you see all these recipes it makes you want to try them. Food is awesome. Im not saying that everything will be better than its carbier cousin but it might get you over that current craving. You might even like it better!If you do start it and fall off the bandwagon maybe doing something everyday that is healthy will change your mindset. You can drink an extra glass of water or put on a song and dance to it for exercise. Really anything that will make you healthier everyday small or not. I know that feeling of cheating and hopelessness. It sucks   It also helps to remember that the food you are craving will always be there. So for now you eat to lose weight. When you are done you can eat those things. Ofc in a better way like on the weekends and work out more but yea.Hope this helped you  If you need some support let me or us know!,keto,cr8tdc7,1,t5_2rske

3971034,0,t3_35xy9w,Oh sure for awhile at least. Did lazy keto my first month lost  pounds which was super amazing and Ive hovered between  since the end of April. If you have a lot of weight to lose lazy keto can be very effective. I do believe as you get closer to your goal watching portions on the more carby foods you eat nuts berries even heavy whipping cream is important and you may have to watch calories more explicitly as you get very close to your goal weight. I started with only  pounds or so to lose so Im not super upset the other  arent falling off fast but I do believe if you keep carbs under  weight loss should be fairly effortless. Ive been more in the  carb range and that seems to be more of a maintenance number for me. Everyone is affected differently by carbs and it changes as you get older. ,keto,cr8xizz,1,t5_2rske

4011227,0,t1_crd06c1,Australia does have a large grass fed cattle industry.  We have lots of space and generally its just good economic sense to grass feed the cattle.  The problem is that we are prone to drought which means the cattle have to be given feed.  Not always grain but certainly its common.  Cattle are also often finished on grain.  So be careful making the assumption that Aussie beef or lamb is grass fed.Heh heh right now our beef is crap.  Weve had a huge drought and many cattle owners have culled extensively.  What was left of their herds have been extensively fed on feed.  Then the best goes to export and were left with the lesser options.  You can really taste the difference.Actually I asked some questions of a butcher once and he said that they can claim it as grass fed even if it is grain finished or has been supplemented by feed to a certain percentage.

So if your body is already set up to use fat its a lot easier to tap into your stored fat and save your stored sugar for when you really need it.

4073706,0,t1_crkmfb4,As I mentioned its not the distance its the sprints. Keto is tough with anaerobic exercise  glycogen IS required for that if you want to be fast. From Lyle himselfgtAnaerobic ExercisegtWhile anaerobic exercise refers generally to any activity which lasts less than three minutes or so most individuals are interested in the effects of a CKD on weight training. However athletes involved in sports such as sprinting or any activity lasting less than three minutes will have the same considerations discussed in this section.gtWeight training refers to any activity involving the use of heavy resistance which lasts less than three minutes i.e. it is anaerobic. Weight training is slightly more complicated to discuss in terms of fuel use than aerobic exercise. For very short activities less than  seconds muscles use ATP adenosine triphosphate which is stored directly in the muscle. Activities lasting greater than  seconds will rely on the breakdown of glycogen carbohydrate stored in the muscle. During anaerobic exercise fat can not be used directly as a fuel .gtRelatively few studies have examined the effects of carbohydrate depletion on resistance training. In fact no studies have studies the effects of a ketogenic diet on weight training performance. However since weight training can only use glycogen for fuel we can logically conclude that carbohydrates are critical for weight training performance. In fact this is the primary reason to insert the carbloading phase of the CKD on the weekend to sustain high intensity exercise performance while still deriving the benefits of ketosis. Other issues pertaining to glycogen levels and depletion appear below.,keto,crkmnpi,1,t5_2rske

Your friend had a good Trig count to being with and its gone down even more. HDL Good cholesterol. Numbers greater than  are desired. You friend seems to be on track for this.LDL Bad cholesterol. Considered to be high if it is higher than  mgdL. Levels between  are considered high if You have diabetes and are between ages  and  You have diabetes and a high risk of heart disease You have a medium or high risk of heart disease. Without knowing more about your friend this seems like a completely normal result. VLDL Another Bad cholesterol. Normal range is  mgdL with lower being better.

Thats why people who cannot get their blood sugar down i.e. diabetics lose their limbs eye sight and kidneys.It is also well known that eating high carb elevates your blood sugar before your bodys insulin response kicks in to clean things back up. You eat carb youll experience a period of unhealthily high blood sugar. The more you do that the more time you spend in that state.So if you count  together it is not that hard to see why the Western diets shift to high carb slowly but steadily caused harm to so many peoples bodies. Why this is still not commonly accepted wisdom is hard to parse.,keto,crt15ho,2,t5_2rske

Call me a cynic but I think youre supposing that a few changes in a few dietician associations are having a significant impact such that giant companies like McDonalds are willing to go along.  The food McDonalds makes is from ingredients that are  highly subsidized and cheap  almond buns are not cheap to make and likely not cheap to store. ,keto,crtbayg,7,t5_2rske

Itll be tough at first but soon enough you wont even look at carb heavy foods.  Especially after the first time you cheat itll happen and its not really a bad thing as long as you dont make it a habit.

4158392,0,t1_cru4e30,Youre going to be fighting uphill on any discussions about cholesterol.  TC and LDLC are not very good predictors but weve heard about them for so long that pretty much everybody defaults to worrying about them and its pretty much a guarantee that people around you will freak out if your LDL isnt somehow perfect.  An invaluable resource is Attias series starting here   Get through the whole series and youll know more than your doctor.  But here are some bullet points. Fat cells store cholesterol with the fat.  As fat cells shrink i.e. weight loss the cholesterol gets liberated too.  That cholesterol has to pass through the blood to get cleared.  Hence blood cholesterol can increase during weight loss. Particle counts gtgtgt cholesterol levels as far as predicting cardiovascular disease.  Even a low LDLC can be bad if its comprised of a bunch of tiny particles.   if a particle count test isnt doable it would cost me  to get one done as my insurance doesnt cover it yet look at the TGHDL ratio.  High triglycerides can sometimes indicate a lot of tiny LDL particles which contain a higher  of TG than larger LDL particles. Speaking of TGs if your triglycerides come in under  your LDLC may be overestimated in the blood profile.  The formula for LDLC was calibrated using higher TG levels and the assumptions behind it lose validity as TG levels drop or go too high.  ,keto,cru9ngs,2,t5_2rske

It was good that the doctor didnt challenge the decision to drop insulin and he was excited to see the numbers and diet journal tracked scrupulously. So I can assume he is a doctor that gets it when its pushed in his face but wont advocate presumably for the reason you describe. As far as double blind trials weve been having this debate since the s when Atkins repopularized the Banting Diet from the s. Queue the line of other doctors whove written books touting their brand of low carb. And of course in  Gary Taubes published his NYT article What If Its All Been A Big Fat Lie as a precursor to the megatome Good Calories Bad Calories which destroyed the low fat demagoguery. In all of this time  years and counting the medicalresearch community couldve ponied up for several year trials. But they havent. Insult to injury the studies typically pointed to that purport to show low carb is unhealthy are flawed  too many carbs to be considered low carb. The studies that point to saturated fat being unhealthy rely on diets loaded with carbs. My guess is that in another  years the community will still be pointing to a lack of double blind trials as a reason that LCHF isnt accepted practice. Thin gruel.,keto,crxunbp,9,t5_2rske

When its done mix in the egg. After that mix in all the rest of the ingredients. Microwave for  seconds. When its done itll be the size and shape of a large muffin. Cut in half like a hamburger bun. If you want you can crisp it in a skillet with butter or coconut oil. Top with regular pizza toppings go easy on the pizza sauce or use Alfredo. Bake  min in  oven. Makes two bagel sized pizzas. I usually eat both lolOnce you take out the fiber in flaxseed you end up with a crust with only about  carbs. It is delicious and hearty. Reminds me of those little personal pan pizzas I used to get from the Pizza Hut book club.The best thing is the basic recipe oil egg flaxseed baking powder is a great base for all sorts of things. Craving something sweet? Add cinnamon and splenda or whatever sweetener of your choice to the base recipe. Mix a couple tablespoons of cream cheese with sweeter and vanilla extract for a frosting.  Enjoy a delicious warm and fluffy cinnamon roll. Make the base recipe by itself and use it to make breakfast  mcmuffins. Use the pizza crust recipe but make a grilled cheese with it. When Im especially lazy I just make the base recipe and smear some natural peanut butter on them and drizzle with sugar free maple syrup.

4243478,0,t3_39jg9d,Well to start I think keto is the most effective type of diet for fat loss but it can be double edged.  Do you own a scale?  If not it would really be in your interest to invest in one you can get a cheap food scale for  bucks at walmart or less maybe. A lot of keto foods are to no surprise calorie dense because theyre high in fats like the butter and heavy cream you mentioned or mayo almond butter olive oil etc.  Weighing out your food or at least measuring it with the appropriate utensils is probably a necessity.  No one can really eye out a serving of those kinds of foods correctly all of the time and the extra calories can add up quickly.How many calories youre going to want to eat depends on your age as well but if youre going to intense dance classes x a week you would definitely be losing weight quickly eating at  calories daily and maybe adjusting that as need be.   As a rule of thumb every  pounds of fat lost is when youll want to lower calories by about  but every person is different.  Also note that if you cut carbs youre going to lose a lot of water weight initially so dont be surprised if you weigh in  or so pounds lighter or maybe more after just one week.  It takes a week maybe two to calibrate to the diet and then the losses made after that would be mostly if not all fat.  Anyone who says that youre eating at too large of a deficit AKA too few calories says that out of caution that you would slip up on the diet not out of fear of a starvation mode or something of that nature.  ,keto,cs3y3yl,1,t5_2rske

If you were older you could drop down to  calories but you really do need the extra because you are growing  your body needs the energy to build more bonemuscletissue. How active are you? If you want to look and feel your best I highly recommend doing some form of resistance training  either lifting weights or doing body weight fitness.

If you have a good bit of weight on you then you will probably be able to eat what proteins and fats you like in the early stages of Keto. Just do it for a while with only keeping an eye on your carbs and as you see success you will feel more and more comfortable to make tweaks as necessary.

Keto is the complete opposite of what people believe since carbs does give people energy and it is easy to think fat turns to fat. Even I did research on fatcholesterol affecting heart disease before starting keto. Btw usually the only people who will listen are those who are desperate to lose weight.I suppose you could say back to these people that think keto will kill you by asking them why then do doctors recommend keto to epileptics and diabetics.,keto,cswgrgn,2,t5_2rske

4523588,0,t1_ct0tbje,Because usually they dont have the boxes or here plastic side salad trays as readily available.  You also get into a rhythm of laying down the paper laying out the buns and layering the patties and condiments in a certain way on top of the buns before putting it all together and wrapping it up.  With a burger in a tray you have to usually go somewhere else to get the tray put the burger and condiments in a different order for doubles since you cant just build on top of the buns put the cover on and usually put it in a different spot since the plastic tray will melt on the burger chute.  It takes you out of your rhythm.It also is more of a hassle for the person who puts the food in the bag the expediter because the salad trays usually dont fit in the normal bag so you have to get a special salad bag which you have to finagle it into rather than just plop it in like with a regular burger and then you have to add forks and knives.Honestly its not that much more of a hassle but when you have  something orders piled up and your manager is holding you to minute and twenty second drive thru times the extra seconds add up.Not that I dont still order bunless burgers the kids can deal with it but its still a hassle.,keto,ct0u65y,6,t5_2rske

4547917,0,t3_3dcaui,You have to eat a huge amount of protein .glbd well above where youd likely be kicked out of ketosis before you have to worry about toxicity.gt A suggested maximum protein intake based on bodily needs weight control evidence and avoiding protein toxicity would be approximately of  of energy requirements at approximately  to . g x kg x d corresponding to  g protein per day for an  kg individual on a kJd diet. This is well below the theoretical maximum safe intake range for an  kg person  to  gd.In your case you probably dont have to worry until you go over g of protein per day.That being said a high protein intake is probably not the optimal way to get energy and its not optimal for environmental reasons either so you might want to focus on trying to incorporate more fat in some way e.g fattier cuts of meat like youve said. Perhaps you can try and find some high volume food like vegetables if you want the physically full feeling without the high calorie count.You could also try aiming for nutritional ketosis less protein and more fat as some people report just not wanting to eat with higher ketone levels Andreas Eenfeldt Lose Weight by Achieving Optimal Ketosis  Jimmy Moore Jimmy Moores n Experiments Nutritional Ketosis Day ,keto,ct3w1fm,3,t5_2rske

4642061,0,t3_3ei067,You are right.  You are about the third person seeking to gain weight who has posted here over the last year or so.  The poster below was absolutely right  The issue needs to be about gaining muscle and lean body mass not about just gaining weight.  Do you really need anybody to tell you how to gain fat?. Read the rketogains FAQ.. Carbs at g protein at least .gLBM pound calories at maintenance level to around  calorie surplus per day..  Stop or cut back on the cardio and start or increase weightlifting.  Increase protein to .g.gLBM pound on heavy weight lifting days.  Dr. Layman recommends that every adult should be eating at least g of protein a day and since I doubt that you have even  pounds of lean body mass you will be one of the people with higher protein intake needs over .gLBM pound..  The normal recommendation is to stay with the Standard Ketogenic Diet for  months until you master your carb control and become familiar with the foods and macros etc.  Depending on a lot of factors you may be ready to move to the Targeted Ketogenic Diet TKD and a higher carb limit of more like gg right from the start.  If you are currently on a high carb diet you might be better off with just following the basic program and going down to g carbs because of carb cravings.  Then you should be able to slowly raise your carb intake by g each week beginning in week  until you hit perhaps the g level or higher.  If your carb cravings become unmanageable then you will need to lower your carbs a bit.Have you always been this way or have you dieted down to this condition?,keto,ctfp4zi,1,t5_2rske

4652114,0,t3_3eor1i,gt... a little over half of the amino acids in protein are converted to glucose in the body producing an antiketogenic effect. From Volek and Phinneys Art and Science of Low Carb... Performance bookProtein carbs and ketones all stimulate enough insulin to keep us from going into ketoacidosis so too much drives down ketones.Also protein stimulates insulin  independently of the glycemic response it seems see Holts paper  on the insulin index.From a Volek interview  gtSome of the amino acids in protein can be converted to glucose and some increase insulin.Because of this ideally you want moderate protein .. grams per lb of lean body mass via their second book or .. if going by their first book. A typical figure would be g of proteinday.Brad Pilons ideas on protein are interesting He reviews studies and finds that even for people trying to gain muscle through lifting weights for just about anyone gday is finegt grams per day seem to be enough to meet the muscle building needs of most adult men and women...gtSo the final answer to how much protein do I need to eat to build muscle is...  Eat between  grams of protein per day in one or multiple meals.,keto,ctgykbd,1,t5_2rske

Before that I can still be easily swayed into eating something carb filled as I am just starting my diet so it wont hurt to just restart. What I did in this case is I avoided going out to eat get togethers etc for over a month. I got my diet in check. Then when I started going back out to things I had no problem sticking to keto.

You can always check your blood ketones with a meter but if youre not hangry and sluggish assuming weve eliminated low sodium  as the cause of sluggishness then fluctuating within your carb threshold or occasionally going over somewhat is unlikely to be an issuethat is to say sure driving down ketones with increased insulin via excess glucose via excess carbsprotein will slow fat burning by increasingly blocking the release of fatty acids from fat for ketogenesis but thats primarily significant in the sense that youll lose that optimal fuel flow via blood ketones and get hungry and tired and can lead to excessive eating or carb binging.,keto,cu001m9,1,t5_2rske

Moreover it ignores the recommendation that people with metabolic issues eat  net grams a day which I have heard Phinney say in numerous interviews in fact going so far as to say that if youve had any history of insulin resistance you likely need to eat that few carbs for the indefinite future. Lastly given the insulin resistance the experience is that many just do not do well with  net grams a day both in terms of weight loss as well as hunger and cravings.

4814369,0,t3_3gtid1,The infographic has two main mistakes in my view. To lose weight in healthy individuals you need a calorie deficit.. The effect of glucagon on blood sugar is missingTo the first point most overweight people have insulin resistance so solving this first through keto opens the door to weight loss. To go through that door a calorie deficit is still required.To the second point insulin does not act in a vacuum it acts very differently in muscle and fat tissue in the liver and in the brain. The way it acts in the liver is modulated through glucagon  a peptide hormone which rises in response to protein consumption.The takeaways beingEat few carbs and relatively more protein to control insulin and combat hyperinsulinemia. Eat less fat to enter a calorie deficit. Sounds like keto.,keto,cu1e389,1,t5_2rske

Think of ketosis as a spectrum rather than an inout binary state with magical weight loss powers you want to stay somewhere in a range of carbs best for you that gives you enough fuel from ketones and fatty acids by keeping insulin low that you feel good each day.

Of course you can eat minute amounts of those foods and remain in ketosis but then are those foods keto?Perhaps we are coming from different places entirely.

4922666,0,t3_3iavjx,gt Is this a service youd use?Yep Id use it.  Of course it depends on a lot of factors but the premise is good.  Ive never used a mealplanning application so I dont know how the competition is doing.  gt What other features would you like to see in it?Im a college student and if you want to target college students theres a few things to consider.  We dont have a lot of cash and we dont like spending a ton on groceries.  If you could include a factor in your algorithm that takes ingredient prices into account Id definitely use it.  Keto isnt always cheap but it can be with a little extra work so Id love if an app did all that work for me.  Regional prices might be tough to incorporate into an app but itd be a huge advantage on your competition.Another thing is that I dont have a lot of fridge room.  My apartment is very small and only has a minifridge.  I have to be careful when buying food so I can fit everything in the freezer section.  If I feel like buying something that doesnt fit in the freezer I usually go to the store twice that week.    So that might be a good route to take have the user input when they plan to go to the store.gt Would you be willing to pay for something like this?Sure.  If the service is good.  As I said Ive got certain needs and if the app doesnt fit my requirements it wont be any good to me so I wouldnt bother buying it.  If it works for me Id buy it in a heartbeat.  Just please dont make me pay then hit me with ads.  Thats an instant refundblacklist in my book.gt What would you deem a fair price point?Someone mentioned a subscription which is really interesting.  Id be cool with paying a dollar or two every month to use it.  If youd prefer to charge a single price Id probably limit it to .  If it is a fullyfeatured website with graphs charts exceptional features etc Id even be willing to pay .  But I need to know that my investment will be worth my money.  If I find a free alternative online I definitely wont pay that much.  If theres an AndroidiOS app a tabletoptimized website and a normal fullfeatured website I could see myself paying .gt Is there something you dislike about this idea?I feel like limiting yourself to ketoonly is just splitting you from the rest of your potential market.  You could make a lot more money by just offering a keto option and a normal option.  I know that you want people to eat healthy but I think youre alienating a ton of people by sticking to ketoonly.  Maybe you could allow people to input their own macros and the algorithm would calculate recipes with those micros plusminus a few grams for variety.  These kinds of options could be the difference between making  and  or more D.gt Do you see this succeedingfailing? If failing why?  That is really hard to say. I have no idea what the market is for this idea.  Im sure one of you has a background in business so theres no need for detailed explanations.  But do some market research before investing a ton of time on this.  Reddit is a nice place to get feedback but rketo has only so many people.  If you havent yet seek out bodybuilding forums or nutrition forums and ask around there.  Maybe make questionaires to leave at a gym or at a grocery store.  I said earlier that limiting yourself to ketoers takes a lot of the market away so if you want to stick to ketoonly you might want to include some information on keto to the people youre marketing to.  A lot of people come up with ideas for dream applications but arent able to complete them.  I dont know how big your team is if you have any investors if youve got the skills required to develop these apps or if this was just some quick idea that a few buddies threw around one day.  If you manage to pull through on all of the features you mentioned I think this could really work.  Itll take a lot of work but I see myself using this app one day.  However you plan to do this I wish the best of luck to you!  Please update us on your progress so we can use it and build a userbase.,keto,cuf1god,1,t5_2rske

4958211,0,t3_3itcrx,Thats a lot of alcohol that you had! Keto can affect alcohol tolerance  it can actually be dangerous. Early keto can cause electrolyte imbalances  alcohol exacerbates that. You may have been close to alcohol poisoning. Eating may have slowed the alcohol absorption  or replaced some electrolytes or rehydrated you.Seriously consider this before drinking that much in the future.  Test your tolerance in a safe place not a bar and definitely dont drive until you know your limits.As for the tacos you  really need to look at your  motivation and dedication to eating keto and then try and adjust your attitude. An inadvertent slip up us a chance to learn and do better  not a trigger to throw in the towel. Slip ups happen.  In the early days you will likely feel significantly worse immediately afterwards inflammation may return  water weight may return  you may have intense cravings and prolong the adaptation phase.

5024618,0,t3_3jr3bh,Make sure you add some longer duration movements into your exercise regimen. Running is probably out of the question but you should try to walk longer distances  try walking at a pace thats just a little faster than comfortable and aim to go a little further every time. There are a ton of start to run regimens out there that work fine for walking at a moderate pace too.There are two reasons for this. Firstly because you are carrying around so much weight while moving around you burn relatively high amount of calories while doing this. But the trick is that you have to move around  an exercise bike or elliptical trainer is far less effective though still effective. And every kilocalorie burned is an eight of a gram weight lost.The second is that you can feel yourself improving. It gets a little easier you go a little faster you recover faster. It is immensely rewarding and motivating. Ive been doing running myself I started out walking too though and it feels great to improve. But the best part was that I was helping a friend move a few weeks ago and I was walking up and down stairs.... without getting winded and sweaty. What also helped me is to have a big but attainable goal. Theres a bunch of stairs near my house which are supposedly the tallest stairs in the Netherlands. I wanna run up those. Im not quite there yet but will be soon and it feels great getting closer and closer.I really hope you the best with your journey  keep calm keto on and loss will be your reward.edit Ive been told I talk a little too absolutely and it comes off as rude. I meant to use my own personal experiences as a piece of advice  Im not some exercise guru and didnt mean to come off as a do this or youll fail! guy.,keto,curnoxt,3,t5_2rske

5145971,0,t3_3lgmqp,I have this exact same issue but has been with me since before keto only started today.I had the paindull ache for approximately  months and couldnt work out what it was. I was also experiencing a very sharp pain underneath my right rib that lasted for about  or  seconds which was happening approximately once per fortnight out of the blue it rendered me unable to move for those few seconds.After visiting the doctor they took blood samples which showed a vitamin B deficiency and high inflammation levels. Liver function and kidney function all came back perfect they tested me for pretty much everything and took a lot of blood.So they suspected it was a gallstone that could be blocking the duct between the gallbladder and wherever that leads to I think the stomach. The sharp pain being the gallstone moving.I was given B injections and went for a private ultrasound.The ultrasound came back showing all organs at good and equal sizes and no signs of gallstones or anything wrong at all.With this information the doctor took more blood tests and they came back showing the inflammation had gone.I have now been prescribed pills that combat gastritis as a test from the doctor but I really dont think it is this.I have also had an issue with my right neckshoulder muscle and it being stiff and unable to turn my head fully to the right. This has been occurring for the same length of time as the gallbladder issue and I have since found out that it can be related.During this time I have gone from working quite hard and manually to setting up my own business so not as physical day to day. Ive noticed the pain a lot less and the neck seems to be okay apart from the odd day here and there. Not sure if its because Im getting used to it now or if its sorting itself out.Anyway I just thought Id share the experience.PS Im a  male that is quite slim but has a bit of fat around the stomach area due to a bad and inconsistent diet.,keto,cv6a6hs,1,t5_2rske

Im just going to pull out two examples from that article to show how the scientific community isnt even close to settled on this subject. The study that he cites when he makes the claim that despite the number of people getting sufficient amounts of activity obesity has risen actually contradicts his whole point.  Yes the number of people with sufficient levels of activity went up. But the overall amount of activity decreased. That seems like it woulda been important to include.. He claims that diet and exercise didnt make much of a different when put up against just diet.  Instead the study actually shows statistic significance across all categories that are measurable including Body weight body fat blood pressure waist size blood lipids etc.  Here is the actual concluding statement from that scientific studygt Moderatequality evidence from the present network metaanalysis suggests that D  E can be highly recommended for longterm obesity management. Furthermore the evidence suggests a moderate superiority of D over E with respect to anthropometric outcomes.To throw this article down and claim the scientific community has a consensus thinking in that exercise is not important to weight loss is just downright wrong.

For example you might have food weight in your body from that meal but theres no way any digestive process has fully accounted for the foods total effect in your body yet.Ive read on boards where people will see the number go up on the scale  or  days after a cheat meal or cheat day.  Even if you had very high carbs that would bring you out of ketosis it might take more time for your body to replenish the glycogen and its associated water that raises the scale number.Daily weighing is an illusion because our bodies dont operate on the strict schedule we imagine.,keto,cveufhq,1,t5_2rske

5233343,0,t3_3mmiv7,This is a big discussion on the website.  I personally do not count nor could I sustain any program that requires you to count.  I think Keto is easier to follow because of the satiating aspects of a high fat diet.  But if you are not losing and not counting counting for a while or forever maybe your solution.  What I have done is to try and find  go to meals or foods I like to eat no the macros of those items what a portion looks like and eat mostly those foods.  In a sense I have counted my  items but day to day there is no need for a MFP ect.There are many people on this website who have made KETO as simple as possible and have done something similar to what I have explained search and you will find.Others are adamant counters and it works for them and probably is the only way that would work for them.

I basically have meat or fish and vegetables for every meal including breakfast which includes eggs. Prior to starting Keto and I also do Alisa Vittis Flo Living protocol I was working my way toward veganism because ethically thats where my heart is. But when I gave up all sugars and artificial sweeteners dairy and grains I could finally hear my body clearly and it was screaming for meat. So I decided to listen as an experiment and do not regret it.The thing that is important for me is that I eat organic as much as I possibly can. With meat oftentimes I cant find organic so I buy as natural or as ethically as I can. It gives me peace about the fuel Im putting in my body and I know Im not building up a ton of toxins in my body that can contribute to hormonal imbalance and eff up my metabolism even more. How about just adding small amounts of fatty meat? Prosciutto smoked salmon fatty ground beef chicken with skin etc? I like to cook large amounts and then freeze part for future. I also save all my bones in a freezer bag to make bone broth every couple weeks. Also I am currently not eating dairy.,keto,cvkmgcd,1,t5_2rske

While the post is more about coritsols ability to cause insomnia cortisol will also increase hunger as will other stress hormones that you release due to training. However dont eat back calories you burn from working out is just shitty advice. Average adult male has to run MORE than a marathon to burn a pound of fats kcals. Exercise to improve overall health not to lose weight. Lose fat by eating less than you consume until you are at a bodyfat percent you are happy with and then figure out your maintenance kcals for a few weeks then if you want to increase strength and muscle mass start adding a small surplus.

5449687,0,t1_cw7d03i,I just listened to this podcast yesterday. I agree with anbeav I think it shouldnt be promoted so heavily by Jimmy he has a wide audience but I think its being far simplified that its safe to do without doctor supervision and I say this because I assume most going to their regular doc and saying theyre planning a  day fast generally wont go over so well it would be hard to find a doctor willing to supervise heck most doctors unfortunately dont support low carb. For some especially those who are overweight from binging behaviors long term fasting could equally cause triggers breaking the fast by binging andor could cause poor connotations with food in general even for people who havent had history of disordered eating. Its probably a tempting idea because its the thought we all know starvation leads to weight loss... however eating a calorie deficient can do the same thing without being so drastic. And to be fair Jimmy doesnt seem to want to count calories to lose weight he is somewhat hefty despite his past weight loss... but hes completely willing to do fasts for weeks to see results but wont manage calorie counting on a day to day to see results.

Its sort of an ongoing process especially if you exercise or exert yourself and sweat a lot.  Its one thing to just be peeing them out but add heavy sweating and you can feel the sodium and potassium virtually draining out of you.I just make sure to get plenty of both every day and I never have any issues.

5543971,0,t3_3qz1py,Think of it this wayif you continue eating only eggs and Quest bars thats NOT sustainable long term.  Take it from someone who lost  lbs and has been maintaining that loss for the past  years.  For the longtime obese maintaining is MORE challenging than losing.So you need to develop a way of eating that will be sustainable long term otherwise no matter how much weight you lost you will regain it.  The only way Ive maintained my loss is by remaining very low carbwith the VERY occasional indulgence. My body wants its fat back and I have to fight it to remain at a normal weight.  My doctors all tell me that this is what happens and the statistics on regains confirm this.  Unless you eat as you did when losing the weight returns more quickly than you lost.This might be a great opportunity for you to develop such an eating plan for yourself.  ,keto,cwka46k,1,t5_2rske

5545822,0,t3_3r1051,The picky eating is what made you fat in the first place. This lifestyle change wont work if you truly dont want to change. As other have said start with stuff you do like and go from there. I hated veggies growing up and I think mainly it was because it was prepared the same way boiled to death unseasoned and slathered with processed cheese or real cheese. I eat veggies everyday now but most of the time I roast grill or sautd. Butter olive oil or bacon grease is your friend here along with spices. Veggies do not have to be boring.

5603929,0,t1_cwrmvct,Your calorie intake is somewhat correlated to your macros cal per gram of protein or carbs  calories per gram of fat. At the end of the day you need to be at a caloric deficiency to lose weight.For example using my use case  calories is a lot just for a dessert. For my weight and height at a  deficiency I would need to eat at around  calories a day. Four hundred empty calories would account for a single meal if my basis was on the standard daily three meals per day. You want to meet your protein number while keeping your fats and carbs below theirs. People tend to use keto as an excuse to consume crappy food. Yes you will lose weight but you are still practicing poor habits which are fortunately better than your old ones. Why not do it right the first time? That is just my take on it but I understand everyone has their vices or some people work better taking baby steps.If you meet your protein minimum and sit below your rated caloric intake minus deficiency and supplementing your necessary nutrition salts vitamins et cetera then by all means eat the heavy cream and jello. But understand being on keto doesnt mean you can eat beyond your maintenance calories. Refer to law of conservation of energy excess calories dont just disappear.,keto,cwrpz90,3,t5_2rske

It takes the body around  weeks to start efficiently using fat as an energy source.As most of the second part of my post explains there are no studies showing that keto provides a metabolic advantage even Taubes acknowledges this. For the metabolic advantage claim to be accepted it need to be proven first and the studies done so far does not support that hypothesis.gt Honestly I dont know what I believe about calories in and calories out but low carb definitely curbs appetite for those who grow accustom to it. Many people dont consider it a diet you go on to lose a few pounds but as a way of life especially diabetics.Carb restriction has a lot of advantages but so far it doesnt look like a metabolic advantage leading to more fat loss is one of them.,keto,cwtf1ng,2,t5_2rske

My weight has remained relatively stable lbs while on this diet and in preketo I did have eggs on occasion and my LDLC was fine so thats why I think saturated fat is doing it to me. Hypercholesterolemia does complicate things... Ive heard of people in your situation using statins to lower LDLC. I think assuming that it takes years for plaque to form in the arteries with high LDLC and P again assuming worst case in your situation but it may not be necessary to try statins if you reach your weight loss goal within a year or two and your cholesterol levels stabilize. If I were in your situation with familial hypercholesterolemia I would consult with a ketofriendly doctor and possibly consider statins.

That brings you up to g of protein. g of carbs is not bad but it is recommended to drop down to g to give yourself more room in case of mistakes. Also you really dont want to go below  calories otherwise your deficit is getting way to big gt which can cause a stallother issues.   As for your stall  weeks really is not that long of a time frame for a stall. If you are eating at your deficit then you should be ok. Instead of looking at the weight look at other signs. Do your clothes fit a little bit better? You are more than likely still losing fat but your body is retaining water so the weight itself is not dropping.

5750583,0,t3_3tvnbz,Please stop immedeate. Metformin and Ketosis or Fasting is extremly dangerous. My wife was  times on the intensitive care until they found the problem around Metformin.Metformin works on the glucose synthesis capabilities of the liver and its lactose pathes.If you feel tired and have slight cramps in the legs or arms DO NOT LAY DOWN and sleep it could be the last sleep if you are alone.The blood acids can go havoc and thats it.Google biguanid death and fatal lactosis metformin. There is a long story behind. The people on the intensitive care told me they fairly often have the problem which is in a high percentage deadly if you are alone.To heal the diabetes you have to go different.First return to low carb  from low glycemic carbs and after a short period messure your CPeptide value. That is the marker of own produced insulin. If it is above the minimum i remember  mikroliter but check with your laboratory check for bloodsugar response to a morning meal. If it is below  skip the metformin and go for a combination of fasting and HIIT to break the insulin resistance.After  days the blood sugar should drop to  values. Be sure to have sugarhoney or such handy and someone supervising you. The regulation then over a few days goes into the range .. morning fasted again.No you did win. You can reintroduce Keto meals and AC in approx  month will be nondiabetic.Please check everything with your doctor and be careful with fasting  keto  zerocarb and Metformin.DRINK A LOT and do not forget sodiumYou might also refer to the UK site I had this and others as a starting point and that guy was even that nice that he helped us on some questions per mail!,keto,cx9wypj,14,t5_2rske

If were somehow just going over on calories well were going to have to figure out where were doing that and change it.I guess the frustrating thing is that even with just the shift in our diet  and yes its a dramatic shift but weve made it  were not seeing much success.

5826394,0,t3_3uzvay,First start taking vitamin D k iu per day and stabilize your sleep pattern. Get to bed and wake up at approximately the same time every day. These two things will have an enormous impact on your mood.Eating keto is actually fullretard level easy. Cooking eggs takes almost no effort. Hard boiling them in large batches makes the effort per meal even lower. Slow cookers are the champions of keto. Theres no recipes needed theres almost no effort involved and its impossible to burn the food. All it takes is a scant minutia of preplanning. Put a large chunk of meat in it beef pork or a chicken and leave it in there for  hours then throw some salt on it. You can put the whole bowl in the fridge when its done and pick at it all week. Food doesnt get any easier than this. Slow cookers can be shipped to your door for . The hardest part is remembering to eat fresh vegetables now and then.The catch is you have to stop making carbohydrates available. If theyre in your house youre going to eat them. If you dont bring good food to work youre going to end up at a fast food place. Make good food choices the lazy choice by making them available. Are you going to go shopping for sugar am or are you going to eat the meat sitting there in the fridge?Crawl out of your hole and make some positive decisions for yourself.,keto,cxjd6cz,2,t5_2rske

Frozen veggies are usually about a dollar a bag where I live and check out frozen meats too. Canned tuna with mayo eggs. You can freeze bacon so if you see it on sale get it.

For most people this point is around g of carbs but that of course varies by person and activity level. g is the recommended level because it gives you some leeway in case you make a mistake one day andor eat something that has hidden carbs.   As for winging the diet once you have an actual idea of what is food you can do it easy. For example the only thing I actually track is my calories. I know from experience from tracking what I eat in detail that my general meals will put me close enough to my macros.

If you mix up keto chow and then stick it in the fridge without mixing it again  minutes after the initial mixing then the fiber settles to the bottom and starts to clump together ultimately you can end up with a layer of hydrated fiber.

If you keep carbs at ltgday then you are in ketosis within  hours and will stay there as long as you keep the carbs low.  No verification required or desired.Yes your calories were set wrong as were your macros.  Follow what uGalivis already posted for corrected numbers.  Then you will watch as the weight begins to fall off.Now as a nb please read the following An important PSA PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR ELECTROLYTES NOW as in right now. This will save you problems before they happen.  grams of sodium salt and . grams of potassium. You may be getting sufficient sodium from your diet but track it and dont guess. If youre not you can drink bullion make bone broth eat pickles drink pickle brine or eat green olives.You also need to track potassium but it is more elusive as it does not have to appear on nutrition panels. Some manufacturers include it many dont even though the food might have a lot like bacon. Avocados broccoli all red meat fish and shellfish all have a lot. Many MFP entries are wrong or missing potassium content entirely use google or the USDA site to crosscheck.Then go buy some No Salt or other potassium based salt substitute. You can add it to food or mix  tsp at a time in cold water and drink it. Use Mio flavor drops if you hate the taste. Do that several times a day particularly during the first transition phase. Then you wont have to post questions about the ketoflu which is almost always due to people not being told that electrolytes are more important to your physical health and how you feel than any of the macros.Hope this helps.,keto,cy77kye,1,t5_2rske

I had some serious social engagements in septoct and both those months I ended up being a reluctant ketoer and november wasnt all that rad either. The coolest thing was I never gained weight just didnt lose much which surprised me quite a bit until I realized that I was always always eating a calorie deficitmaintenance subconsciously ! very sporadic tracking  and this certainly included carbs which I may or may not have accounted for. somehow found a new sense of determination once I realized I am eating lesser calories which meant I learnt something from this experience hoping back on the wagon was no brainer something clicked and the last couple of weeks have been amazing. I dont care for carbs at all husband eats regular diet but no cravings for me nada nothing. I eat what I want to eat and thats it. I havent lost much weight all the water weight went away a long time ago but the feeling of lightness and no bloating and zero cravings are little things I am enjoying the most now. I hope to see a whoosh this weekend havent weighed weighing scale batteries need to be replaced and I am just holding it off all of last week and its liberating. I wake up and eat right without having even a minor second thought. I see clothes fitting better skin glowing and no jitters or snack urges. Doing other things in life has taken precedence now  even eating and making keto foods is not all that big a deal. From the last few months I have a clear idea of what I like and what I dont. I am a poor cook so I dont try fancy things.I am not a big fan of cheesebaconpork but I love veggies. So I set myself up for around g carbs and give me all the veggies I wantset protein right. I failed earlier when I overloaded on things i was supposed to eat  and got tired of it pretty quick.

The higher the deficit the more muscle mass you will lose as your body eats itself. The issue with this is as you lose muscle aside from being unhealthy the amount of energy your body uses every day decreases and thus it becomes harder and harder to lose weight. When you have a lot of weight to lose going to a  deficit can be ok as your body will consume more fat than muscle.

6246848,0,t3_410gx5,I am really happy that keto is working so well for you!    Since you said no one has actually talked about becoming more depressed since stopping meds I thought I would add my story. Changing meds is different for everyone so my results may not reflect yours    I was on zoloft in  for GAD depression and some OCD tendencies. I felt great and my panic attacks had subsided. I had a falling out with the therapist and stopped getting my prescription refilled I was required to see a therapist for meds. I stopped taking anything and felt fine for a couple months.    After about two months my husband noticed I was acting different. I was easily aggravated and criticizing everything. I was barely leaving the house and I had stopped talking to all my friends and family. Ive also gained about lbs during this time.    Since stopping meds my life has fallen apart. I wasnt willing to admit that I couldnt fix my depression without meds. In July of  I started having panic attacks again. This was what finally convinced me that I need help again.  Since then Its been a combo of no health insurance and very long new patient appointments so I still havent started meds again.    I started keto and I do feel better. I do know that everyday is still a struggle and that this normal is still not where I want to be. Stopping my meds was the worst decision I have made in the last few years. Anyways sorry for the long winded post. I really do hope that your results continue and that you are able to continue to function without meds.,keto,cyzp69l,1,t5_2rske

6410239,0,t1_czi92cz,Our diet is all about putting our body in a ketogenic state and that is the basis of the keto. People do it to differing degrees of what you would call healthy. But at the end of the day it means more or less less than g net carbs a day. Ive seen you post a lot of studies about low carb diets. Low carb diets and keto are fundamentally different in their definition. Keto is about your body pulling energy from fat in the form of ketones which is not the case with most so called low carb diets. Which is why most people around here wont accept the articles you are posting. They are low carb not keto. Im doing keto to lose weight and reverse my insulin resistance. I know I have better options than a hot dog. But a hot dog that helps me stay in ketosis and is leaps and bounds healthier than the x a week I gorged myself on fast food before. Which I gaurentee has probably more carcinogens than my hot dog or my bacon. And because my body is now running on ketones and not glucose I am not spiking my blood sugar and insulin. Which means less insulin is needed which ultimately means I will reverse my insulin resistance. There will always be healthier ways to do basically any diet out there. But at least Im doing something instead of nothing so dont judge me for my hot dog or bacon. ,keto,czia2wj,1,t5_2rske

I track every single calorie because I am still trying to lose but my lifelong goal is to get to the point where I can just lift and maintain a healthy weight without having to think so much.

They were pretty accommodating of a friends parents who are both Vegetarian and Kosher. They just need to know ahead of time so they can stockprepare appropriately for Dinner.You can bring MCT oil and BCAAs to supplement your ketones in case youre ingesting more carbs.

6680624,0,t3_46t9k3,Continuing on this time in a little bit different vein you do need to get your situation fixed and it appears that your physician is to blame. Actually it is surprising that the medical profession has their heads in the clouds on this point but that rant I will save for another day.You are young but you need to know where your situation will take you. The estrogens tell the lining of the uterus to grow. This is exactly as it should be for the first part of the menstrual cycle. This is needed so that an egg can attach to the uterus. However Progesterone besides being glue it is also the dont grow signal. The two hormones work in opposition. Estrogen says grow Progesterone says dont grow.When you get too much estrogen or too little Progesterone the cells grow just as they are forced to by the hormones doing the job assigned to them. With more growth and very little of the dont grow signal you will end up with uterine hypertrophy. That is medical talk for a big uterus. Actually it has to happen as it is being told to grow most of the time from the estrogen. The problem is that when you do get uterine hypertrophy your doc will say that is pre cancerous you must have a hysterectromy For over  women a year in the US this is what happens to them.   You can also get cervical dysplasia which is basically growths on the cervix that the doc will freeze off. That one is not so bad comparatively speaking but who needs to endure that?Lastly while the estrogens do not CAUSE cancer having an imbalance of an estrogen driven cancer will certainly grow faster when there is insufficient Progesterone to offset the hormonal signal of the estrogensAgain you are young so there is not much risk of this happening this year or even in  years. But if you do not get a regular cycle going with NO PMS then the odds are good that by age  you will be facing a problem that could have easily been fixed at your age now.Again Best of luck.,keto,d0ac2zk,1,t5_2rske

6690709,0,t1_d0bczdc,. Ok. It makes no physiological sense but what do I know. A doctor confirming your cholesterol is too high honestly means nothing as most are following outdated guidelines. If those are the guidelines you want to follow to dictate your lifestyle choices go for it. You TGs and HDL are excellent. If you want to actually test this then get an NMR test. Blood tests that make no sense but whatever. Like ubidnow said better than I could keto will be here if you want to try it again but youre likely on your way out which is fine its not for everyone but seems pretty premature. Maybe it was all of the above but keto likely also contributed but you seem loathe to give ketosis any credit for any changes in the way you feel. If you have conceptualized keto as abnormal this will never work Its important to evaluate but everything you say is negative or a positive but hard to read it any other way and at least two people independently read it that way ,keto,d0bdmay,3,t5_2rske

6707383,0,t3_47faqy,Just curious when was the last time you tried an avocado?  I was like you before I started on keto.  Someone could pay me a hefty sum of money and I wouldnt touch an avocado much less eat it.  Ive found my palate has changed alot since starting keto though.  I can eat them with no problems now.  Maybe not right off the bat but at least keep an open mind about trying them.  They are one of the most healthy fats you can eat.  If you cant do it you just cant do it though.  When I first started eating them I found I had to mix them in something like a keto taco salad.  I love eating avocados with sour cream! I can understand having that one food you just cant eat though.  Cauliflower is that way for me.  Ive tried it several times over the years.  My aversion has only gotten worse.  I typically gag after eating it now. Tried it every single way imaginable too.  Steamed fried baked bbqed boiled and mashed.  I just cant eat it. As for your original question I highly recommend rketorecipes.  They have an awesome selection.  Some of it is as you said trying to be something that its not.  Alot of it though kind of hits the nail on the head.  If youre craving something you can usually find a recipe to scratch that itch there that is still healthy and wont knock you out of ketosis. My final piece of advice is just remember to watch your portion controls too.  Keto is a wonderful system for losing weight but at the end of the day you still have to watch your macros AND your calories.  It doesnt matter if youre eating keto food or not.  If youre eating k calories more a day than you need of keto food you wont lose weight.  It took awhile for that to sink in for me at least.,keto,d0d3n7m,1,t5_2rske

6848772,0,t3_49jkyw,I have CFSendometriosisother chronic inflammationautoimmune issues manifests in different ways  managed by diet not enough symptoms to diagnose at the moment. The pain I have is similar to fibro but I dont have the pressure points and my Dr doesnt think thats what it is. For almost a year I was pretty much bedridden in the process of trying to diagnose I made some changes started feeling better and as a result cut out all grainsprocessed sugar and most starches. I was strict keto for about a year and a half and lost about  lbs had some flare ups other issues this that and the other thing and ended up more primal grain free no refined sugar some tubers cultured dairy and kept low carb g a day. Strict keto is what I do when I want to lose a few lbs lbs above a healthy BMI right now but I can maintain my weight and my health at g a day without counting anything so long as theres no sugarhoney etc. or grains involved. Its been about  years since I started to feel human again but its not perfect  the endo diagnosis is new and Im still learning how to manage that. For me its all about managing stress and inflammation. Currently the only meds I take are for the endo when the pain is really bad but at different times Ive been on various NSAIDs and sometimes steroids. Cutting out grains got rid of the skin issues and creams to treat them musclejoint aches and IBSlike issues but it wasnt IBS because I can eat broccoli and other trigger foods with no issue... cutting out sugar peanuts and uncultured dairy helped with sleep issues and keeps my energy more level as well as helping with overall pain. One of the most important things for me to keep track of  more than grams of carbs  is protein. g a day minimum up to g a day if theres any sort of stress or if Im having any sort of flare up. The more tiredachy I am the more protein I try to get in. Protein is also important to keep my blood pressure and circulation going well I get pins and needles in my hands and feet and my nail beds and lips turn blue its not fun. For me gut health was important to manage too  probiotcs fermented foods and resistant starch are all important. I also supplement tumeric and ginger and have about  tbs of flax meal every day. I also take epsom salt baths to help with the pain and for extra magnesium. I know managing chronic illness  especially pain and fatigue  is really hard physically and mentally. Adding the stress of adjusting to keto isnt easy  in your case making the transition slowly cutting out grains for a couple weeks then sugar then lowering starches will probably help. Make sure you keep up your electrolytes and keep an eye on protein. Adding in vit d and omega s both can be found in fish is helpful too. At this point most of the time I dont eat out or eat processed foods. There are a few things I will eat occasionally that come in a box but generally its just not worth it. My diet is mostly vegetables broccoli cauliflower string beans greens zuchinni are all favourites eggs meat cheese and seeds. When Im having a flare up I do my best to stay in my routine  lots of slow walking proper food doing things that make me feel capable and productive. Managing the mental side is harder on me than dealing with the physical symptoms at this point. I feel like this was really disjointed and perhaps not very helpful  its a bit of my experiences and how I manage. Feel free to ask anything and Ill answer as much as I can or you can just message me and tell me how much it sucks to be exhausted and buzzing at the same time really is the worst feeling in the world. ,keto,d0sm5yn,2,t5_2rske

So if a label says  carbs  fiber then  of those carbs are nonfiber and  of them are fiber. So we count  net carbs. If you take a fiber supplement it is likely to say  carbs  fiber.

6967089,0,t1_d160f7z,Its keto mixed with intermittent fasting so Im eating all my daily calories within a  hour window I cycle between  hours of fasting. I wouldnt say Im strict keto as I will eat trail mix or a sandwich with bread if I didnt pack a lunch.I work in entertainment so Ive been nearly nonstop working maybe  days off since the beginning of the year getting three films ready for theatrical and festival release so I might get some exercise on the elliptical or free weights  times a week and hopefully I can get more into a routine as things calm down through spring. My secondary fitness goal is to improve flexibility so I try to get some stretching in everyday.The results are similar to  caloric deficit although Im eating comfortably at a  deficit. For my schedule and body type its been very effective and I havent seen any ill effects like fatigue or immune issues though my genetics are pretty robust to begin with no one in my family has skin or digestive issues no allergies etc.My goal is my original low weight of  by July then I want to gain at least lbs in muscle back for the remainder of the year. With beginner muscle gains I think I should be able to achieve that and still scale back to a more moderate longterm fitness plan.In summary its almost all diet for me.,keto,d162079,1,t5_2rske

Competition chili never use a thickener but they do sometimes use Goya Sazon a seasoning mix thats pretty common in any Latin foods section.You can do all this in a slow cooker I make mine in one and I cook it for  hours on low.,keto,d16cqjo,2,t5_2rske

7151299,0,t3_4dgf6g,I take mirtazapine offlabel so I cant really address mood issues. I did a ton of research before I went this route so hopefully this might help... The drowsiness wears off after a couple of months and tends to be more pronounced at lower doses lower than mg Mirtazapine is known to cause weight gain because it messes with appetite...google Remeron munchies!I lost most of my weight while taking mirtazapine. Im not aware of any mechanisms that would cause weight gain in themselves unlike AAPs but I personally suspect that the combination of increased sleepiness and increased appetite is a dangerous combination for some people. Plus depression itself can really mess with weight if thats why youre taking mirtazapine. And sleep problems can really mess with weight if thats why youre taking it. Antidepressants play the longterm game and its just as likely that you need to give everything a few more weeks to settle down.If I can comment on trazodone...where I live its almost exclusively prescribed as a sleep aid rather than an antidepressant.But theres no reason to not start exercisingits super beneficial for mood and stress no matter what medication youre taking or what else youre doing.Either way it sounds like it might be good to sit down and have a proper discussion with your prescribing doctorpsychiatrist. There are tons of antidepressants out there. Some are more sedating some are more activating some are more appropriate for symptoms A and B some are more appropriate for symptoms X and Y. Of course you cant predict how you will feel with a particular medication but if you can discuss what you cant tolerate i.e. drowsiness you can be a bit strategic in your medication trials. Going in and changing medications at random can be counterproductive and worsen symptoms. ,keto,d1r14ib,2,t5_2rske
7153515,0,t1_d1r819s,I have used both egg and butter in the past technique is the same for either. Put the liquid element in one bowl and the breading in another  we tend to use relatively low flat bowls. If you have a lot of breading because youre making a massive batch then split the breading up and only put a portion in the bowl to begin with as it will gradually clump up more and more. Then its just dunk the chicken in the liquid make sure its well covered and then into the bowl with the breading. Turn a few times press gently to make sure the breading has affixed itself well when we use pork rinds we blitz them up in a food processor with all the seasoning first so the breading should be pretty fine and will stick well. Then just place them onto a prepared baking tray we have these little sheets of reusable nonstick liner. Any left over breading I tend to sprinkle over the already breaded strips. I find it helps to try and use seperate hands one to dip in the egg and then pick out of the egg with the dry hand kind of shake it a little to get off excess ad then you place it in the breading. Either that or do it as a pair. My boyfriend always dips in the liquid throws into the breading and then I actually roll it in the breading   it just helps to stop to much excess liquid from getting in the breading and making it clump.This was the original recipe I started with  which weve slowly tweaked over time biggest thing was using less cheese and adding the pork rinds and more spice.,keto,d1ra7vs,2,t5_2rske

I would tell myself to limit how much of it I ate and end up always having some all the time my office is a particularly bad place for that theres always something sweet for everyone in the break room. In January I decided I needed to cut out sugar completely. Now Im not super strict about it I dont go as far as having no BBQ sauce or Ketchup though I already buy the lowcarb versions of this which usually are sweetened with stevia or erythritol instead of sugar. But I havent had dessert since January.All I can say is take it one day at a time. There will be days where the cravings are super intense. But after a while you get used to not having it. Im in my th month of no sugar and Im doing good. I miss it though. Im not done grieving it... when I see pictures of tastylooking dessert I look at them with longing wishing I could partake. But I know myself and I know that Im better off not having sugar. Subsequently this has also helped me curb my hunger in general and have an easier time with calorie counting and for the first time in several years Im actually losing weight instead of losing lbs and then hovering at the same weight for months on end until I give up and scarf down more sugary treats. As sad as it makes me to think about not having a delicious slice of cake or a nice chewy brownie or some really flavorful ice cream... my health is worth this sacrifice. The fact that Im losing weight and feeling good is incredibly encouraging. Im hoping to get to a place where one day I decide to indulge in a bit of sugar and I end up finding it too sweet to be enjoyable though my brain goes noooooo when I think that out loud heh. ,keto,d1u4vay,2,t5_2rske

7270033,0,t3_4eygv1,Thanks for sharing. I too have struggled with nuts. Specifically I have binged on cashews countless times. I remember reading posts on marksdailyapple about others who also struggled with moderation when it comes to cashews. I can have  walnuts close the bag and stroll away without a care. I simply cannot do that with cashews. Pork rinds also are one that I end up inhaling. When I returned to keto this time I swore to myself that in addition to the foods that keto doesnt allow I would remove dairy and any food I have a history of binging on. If I have ever binged on it it doesnt belong in my diet. Ive shown that I cant be moderate about nuts so they need to go. This revelation was expanded to the brazil nuts I bought today for selenium and inhaled like it was my first meal in weeks. ,keto,d24jx99,1,t5_2rske

The preliminary results are good  preferential loss of fat utilizes fat as an energy source improved cardiovascular lipid profiles improved glycemic profile even decreased appetite a greater sense of satiety and fullness and improved athletic performance.

Also I do like to cook a large piece of meat over a long period in stock and then tear it up thats a good way to prep for lunches.  As well as cooking our own burgers or making a meatloaf.  Maybe look into cheeses like halloumi or goats cheese that your body might process differently to other types of dairy.Edit I know youre eating more carbs that keto generally allows but if you want to eat more carbs it might be looking at a diet like paleo which is more friendly towards that but still has some similar elements and no dairy,keto,d2gyzds,1,t5_2rske

What IS a great predictor of risk is LDLP your LDL particle count which isnt given in a standard lipid panel. The only way youre going to get this is to have an NMR done which Peter Attia explains further on his eating academy blog.In simple terms arterial obstruction is caused when LDL particles slip in between the junctions of two arterial cells and get stuck. This causes an immune response to the spot of the intrusion where the immune system attempts to fix the problem. Ultimately this process leads to the formation of arterial plaques and narrowing of the artery. Peter Attia explains this is more detail here LDLC is only a measure of the amount of cholesterol in an LDL particle but in reality who cares because as an extreme example if you only had one LDL particle floating in your bloodstream that had a lot of cholesterol loaded in it do you think that this one particle would really increase your risk of a heart attack? No. The LDL particle count is important because the more particles you have circulating your bloodstream the greater chance there is of a particle getting lodged behind those arterial cells just like your chances of winning the lottery increase the more lottery tickets you purchase. Id have the NMR done and Im pretty sure it will show satisfactory results and at the very least youll be able to make an informed decision on how to proceed next.,keto,d2knjdc,2,t5_2rske

Before I discovered keto I would exercise all the time eat shit and the fat wasnt coming off obviously. As for foods at the moment Im just eating ground beef high fat cheese green leaf lettuce eggs and sausage. But thats about to change very soon because Im almost out of ground beef. I have learned that getting your fats in is so much easier than getting your protein. I would suggest getting leaner cuts of meat and getting your fat from avocado olive oils butter and cheese. These are fats you can easily cook with and they add up fast! Remember protein is your target. You dont have to eat all of your fats. Use the macro calculator to calculate how much you should be eating. Keep carbs at g or below. I know a lot of people dont like to keep track of these things but its good to know so you can be aware of how much food youre actually eating. When I started on keto I wasnt counting and had stalled for a month. I counted for one day and was so surprised that I was overeating!

7577563,0,t1_d32hljd,Sometimes  thatll depend on if youre actually hungry or just dehydrated.  What Tim Ferriss says about salt is that a lack of salt and water dehydration can actually cause carb cravings.  Glycogen holds water so when youre on a carbheavy diet you retain more water and dehydrate less easily.  Thats why you need to add salt at such a high level to a keto diet  because you dont have all the glycogen floating around in your system.,keto,d33j6ni,1,t5_2rske

Keto definitely works for weight loss and is to me the pass of least resistance to weight loss but the amount of fat amp animal based protein is crazy unhealthy especially for long term usage....Eating that much in animal products has been proven to higher levels of cancer amp the amount of fats you eat definitely are going to fuck with your arteries LONG TERM. I would recommend buying a couple different books on nutrition from different vantage points and coming to your own conclusion.

So I play racquetball and burn about  calories in an hour of competitive play. Ill eat  of that back. I think a marathon is a very admirable goal but if weight loss is the main goal you may find a strong lifts  routine to be quite the accelerator in weight loss. Running is aerobic and burns ketones and glucose. Lifting is anaerobic and preferentially burns fat. Also studies show a longer metabolic increase from intense lifting than with endurance activities. And the more lean muscle you have the higher you BMR is though its not a crazy increase. Strong lifts starts very light and easy and can be done in about  minutes. Beginner lifters make crazy strength gains for a solid  months. edit. You can marathon train and lift but never on the same day. Resting is crazy important when lifting so stronglifts is a  day a week commitment. Like I said though if weight loss is the true goal research weight lifting as your path. The evidence is not hard to find and very well researched. ,keto,d3pej1o,2,t5_2rske

There is also a mindset. Sugar will likely be your issue at your age. You simply cant have it. Done. No sodapop etc. This diet is great but like any diets you have to have a good mindset going into it and some self control. Its pretty easy to hit up fast food and have fries and a bun on your burger.

Its removed first because its a poison to the body. gtBut what happens if I slip and eat a cookie for instance. I know about the dopamine hit to the brain and all that but physiologically does that carb get burned first burned after fat is burned stored? How does that work. If anyone has a link that would be great.Since a cookie is a fast carb your blood sugar will spike and the body will burn that fast carb first because its higher energy than fat and a mild poison in high amounts.  The blood sugar spike will create cravings for more fast carbs and cause inflammation.

Most days even  months later Im not hitting that either through the week working a desk job and getting only about  cals. But weekends I eat about  to  and so I average out. I dont even think about my fat macro at all never! I aim for less than g carbs and I aim to get my g of protein I sometimes get a lot more and sometimes less I sit around g to g most days. Sometimes Ive been way over g and even g of protein and Ive never kicked myself out of ketosis with protein. Eating your g of protein will prevent muscle loss adding in weight lifting will further prevent that happening. You could increase more if youre lifting heavy but constantly adding more protein wont improve the no muscle loss scenario more than the recommended amounts and in my experience more also doesnt hinder.  deficit is high! I would reduce to  and as ive said mahy days Im below my calorie goal and over  deficit but then bring it back up  days a week which is ok in the case of calories they can be averaged out over the week. Ive gone from kg to kg as of today weight loss has slowed a lot in the last  weeks but thats due to me eating out a lot lately and eating too many calories I need will step it back up these next  weeks as Ill be in the Maldives in July and dont plan on counting calories then it will be lots of alcohol and lots of proper keto food.

In my opinion if I were you...I would have gone to the doctor just to be sure. Ive had high BP my entire life even as a kid. My latest issue with BP happened last week. Rather than it being low it was sky high even while taking my medication. I had the worst headache that I had had in ages and I started throwing up. After I recovered enough I called for a DRs appointment. Turn out my BP  or something to that effect. It never really occurred to take blood pressure because the medication had been working relatively well but with a lot of side effects I was too stupid to question because I had been met with hostility about it in the past with another DR. Just take the pills he told me.However this one took me seriously when I mentioned the headaches the throwing up the swollen legs hands face itchy throat etc. Ive been on something new the last few days still have a headache but my BP is down quite a bit I can breath clearly Im sleeping through the night for the first In bloody years and my body doesnt ache. She asked me when was the last time I felt good. I couldnt answer because I never did. I was always fuzzy headed tired mildly dizzy and yawning. God the confusion and mood swings that went with it...it was horrible for me and everyone else. Ive been able to pee healthy pees again. I was getting worried because the best way to get rid of excess water in the body is to drink more and I was drinking more in the hopes of getting rid of the fluid that would accumulate in my legs at the end of the day. I thought I was dehydrated from the pills and the keto. Turns out not. My kidneys werent handling the old medication at all and I just couldnt pee out what was going in. Pee would be clear one minute and dark dark yellow only a couple of hours later. So just be cautious and if at any time you start to feel not like yourself. Go to the dr. ,keto,d4fd08r,1,t5_2rske

Brushing a cut surface with lemon or with oil to keep out the air will prevent surface browning but I cant imagine that cutting it up and keeping it in a jar is going to make anything you want to look at.  Just boil your eggs and grab them whole for your lunch.  Peel them at work.  They keep better that way.  Take an avocado with you and eat half of it.

A keto diet can help to create a natural deficit in your eating as you are more satiated with fats then you are with carbs but that is not the case for everyone  especially many who have food issues  which many who are here are here for that exact reason.gtyour body does not have meters that count caloriesNo just no.  Your body does in fact have said meter.  When you consume more energy than your body needs it has a meter that says hey i dont need this energy right now but i might need it later so i will store it as fat.gtso IMO if you are just starting out dont worry about the calories. just concentrate on reducing carbs to a minimum getting protein and fat from whole foods as much as possible. then as fat loss stalls if it does then you might have to get technical with the calories and other aspects.No absolutely you should worry about your caloric intake.  In the beginning i would say no  until you get used to keto and reel yourself in from what is for most chronic over eating carb heavy foods to get over your carb cravings...but after that initial period which should be no longer than  weeks caloric intake counting is ESSENTIAL to weight loss.

It talk me several months of education and the manipulation in order to work out what makes my blood ketone sit at .  ..And the difference in feeling a mental state and energy was amazing.Im friends with the darth and we frequently disagree on this subject regarding protein amounts and that I should be chasing results not Ketone readings.After using my mind I dont like dr Dominic and testing myself when I feel good  vs not good I know I like a higher blood ketone reading.And like darth said in that self experiment listedAt any rate yes protein may hinder ketosis in some people but more so at excessive amounts which from talks with Menno Henselmans can be extrapolated toAnything over .g  lean pound can be counted at  toward your carb intake.Key part I recommend is after established your meal frequency test the loads of the fence and find your sweet spot.As your weight and body composition changes that number most likely will change the future as well.My last comment years everyone is talking about blood sugar and protein response and not thinking about the insulin response of the food and it is most likely a built in mechanism say the body can utilise protein for energy rather than burning fat.So the order for burning fuel in the body for available quick Burns is in order.

8273660,0,t1_d5aa9t2,hey sorry for the late reply. Been sorta busy. Theres a little more depth to your question than that can be covered in a reddit post. dietary studies are very complicated due to inability to really standardize diets too much. Macronutrent cycles calories feeding schedules good luck getting a bunch of people to eat the same thing for a prolonged period of time. How a specific diet affects a specific organ system much more the results of a specific lab test is mostly inferred. I ddnt really look so if im wrong please point me to a particular study. So what ill mention is about liver function tests in general. the liver is probably the most complex of our organs and does a bunch of stuff aids in digestion manufacture of certain products metabolism of toxins and medications etc. A shit ton of stuff basically and no single test is going to be able to keep track of all the stuff going on. Astalt are just enzymesstuff you see in loads of organs like the heart muscles the lung etc. Once upon a time we used Ast routinely to determine if someone was having a heart attack. If theres some inflammation in organs with astalt levels may go up but honestly theres  lot of different variables than can cause increases and dont point to anything in particular. Youd have to establish a persistent elevation allow for the possibility of a lab error and repeat the exams. Once you do that you take a bunch of other tests which might include stuff like an alkaline phosphatase bilirubin protime an ultrasound. Basically a whole lot of stuff for something that may nothing. Maybe after a persistently elevated astalt maybe a few months after the first in an assymptomatic patient then id do a bunch of other stuff.

8281119,0,t3_4swcn4,My personal experience is that yes I get gout attacks more often and more severe. I have a few thoughts on why which I list at the bottom.My occurrance of attacks continued at a higher rate than normal the whole time I kept to a keto diet. They culminated with a week long attack in my right foot AND left knee simultaneously. This was while taking both Allopurinol and Prednisone and is the reason I stopped keto after about  months at the end of last year. I have started keto again and gotten my first attack since that bad last one. It happened after  weeks on keto this past weekend.I am not trying to scare you off. Just be prepared. Ask your doc about using a higher dose of Allopurinol and see if the doc will give you Prednisone. Do you get preattack twinges or fantom pain in your legs before an attack? I do. If I elevate my legs above my head at night after the twinges and any time an attack starts I can prevent it from being nearly as bad if not entirely.Thoughts on why I get more attacks Several keto staples are higher in purines. Toxins are released as the fat stores deplete taxing your kidneys. Kidneys filter out uric acid and they are not functioning properly for us who get gout. The toxins cause their function to be further reduced which results in less filtering of uric acid in the blood so we get higher uric acid levels. This is just a theory tho no facts to back it up.,keto,d5cp66t,2,t5_2rske

8331689,0,t3_4toqzi,Hey there! Welcome to your journey! I wish you the very best!. Some people go for a calorie deficit on Keto and some do not. Personally I go for a calorie deficit which in my case is an extreme deficit. However my issue was never over eating as much as it was the quality of the foods that I was eating. Therefore I can easily ingest  calories and not be hungry.. Avoid sugars as those are not good for you either. Personally I have less than  grams of sugar each day. I also avoid diet foods sugar free foods and most processed foods. I do this as I have heard that these processed chemical filled foods can cause problems. Beyond weight loss stalls we all know that typically diet foods or sweeteners are not good for us. That being said I avoid most processed foods while doing Keto and avoid all sweeteners.. Its not bad per se if thats what works for you. I track everything and that works for me. Im working on a calorie deficit and I keep my protein fat and carbs at certain levels. Usually I keep my protein at  carbs at  and fat at  daily. My wife followed this model and lost about  pounds in  or  months. Shes kept it off with Keto and she is my support system..

8351971,0,t3_4tx40c,This has to be my favorite thread here ever.The only place I have really seen to count calories on keto is here and in the FAQ.My view is that it is lazy to count calories.  It works because you starve as much as via ketosis.  Its not lazy to build your list of preferred foods and to regulate your weight by understanding the effects of the food you ingest.  Counting calories does work but its no fun over the long run.  It is lazy to spam every thread with  weigh your food use the calculator read the FAQ than having to explain all the tricks we pick up to stay in ketosis lose weight and eat like a human instead of an accountant.  No offense meant to accountants!If counting calories has a  error you should put on  lbs over  years on a  kcal maintenance diet.  If counting to g of carbs has a  error its in the noise.Compliance on the diet for the rest of your life is also huge.  We all know were going to put the weight back on if we quit.  When I count calories it was thoroughly discouraging to see how artificially restricted my eating is.  Hit the calorie wall and still hungry means you cheat or get stuck eating celery or lettuce to avoid overeating by much.Im a carnivore not a rabbit.I lost all the weight I planned to and then some.

Both should be  net carbs.But I just try to make sure I have a good amount of greens each meal. If you dont mind eating the same thing everyday finding a formula that works and sticking with it is awesome. Right now I do eggs and sauteed kale for breakfast. Caesar salad with chicken or sardines for lunch. Green shake for dinner. Protein shake after workout. Depending on exact servings it comes out to  calories g fat g protein g carbs.

8574825,0,t1_d6cawum,gt frontSorry for the epic essay length! But I hope this helps  I think its absolutely key that people with as much weight as we have to lose do it slowly. Not just for the sake of loose skin but for the amount of time it takes to build a healthy relationship with food and our bodies. At first you think this is just about losing weight to get a bit healthier or look better but at least for me  this journey has been way way more than that. I didnt even realize how close to death I was and how little I was actually living at my previous size until I started feeling how good I feel now and loving myself the way I do now. I think if I had crashketoed I wouldnt necessarily have come to these realizations. I know its clich but whatever diet I hate this word you choose is a lifestyle and the time goes by much faster than you think  Loose skin has been less of a problem than I was expecting at the outset. This is probably due to the speed of weight loss and weight training but also Im sure a little bit of genetics and my age so take my experience with a grain of salt! Youre also young which is awesome  we have springy skin on our side!I have found that I have virtually no problems really with my limbs  while I do have a bit of loose skin in my upper arms and upper thighs its nothing out of the ordinary and will probably go back to normal as I slowly reach a maintenance weight. While my torso is nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be I can PM you pics if youre interested! chances are good I will get surgery on my tummybreasts once Ive reached where Im comfortable. TMI WARNING!!  Ive gone from a DDD to a C. Chances are good I will get even smaller losing another lbs and as a young woman Id like to have a nice full chest rather than a smaller not so full chest. They dont look bad or saggy AKA  Im not hesitantshy to take my top off at the gym but Id say they arent as full in the upper portion as other people my age. My stomach is hard to explain in writing but if youve ever seen a recentlypregnant stomach its kind of like that. At the moment I wear higherwaisted pants so that I dont have rolls where the waistband would cut into looser skin but I will probably have this flattened in a year or so once Ive maintained for awhile.  While I applaud everyone who embraces their loose tummy skin as a symbol of their journey and perhaps after a few years of maintenance this would maybe go back to normal to me its a symbol of how far I let myself get in the first place and I think having it flattened will be a bit cathartic  but ultimately well see once I get to where I want to be! As for macros My starting stats were  cals and a strict lt net grams of carbs and I tracked my intake almost obsessively on MFP. TBH I wasnt worried at all about muscle in the very beginning and I was pretty much sedentary until October when I started weightlifting. Like a lot of other people starting keto I lost a ton of weight in the first month and then this leveled out to lbs a week.   Whenever I went more than a few weeks without losing any weight I dropped  calories from my total. Once youre keto adapted this is actually really easy  no hunger makes total calories irrelevant. That said pretty much exactly  year in February of this year  weighing lbs I stopped tracking because I found myself unhealthfully overeating in the evening just to hit my calorie goal for the day.  I wasnt hungry I was only eating for the sake of hitting my macro goals.  This seemed counterproductive and like I was replacing one eating disorder with another.  So until about  weeks ago when I started seeing some performance deficits from training I would eat  relatively large meals a day  one around noon to break my fast and then dinner.  Id say my total net carbs were actually in the s as I stopped restricting most vegetables and Im not so strict about asking what is in sauces and things when Im eating out anymore.  Since I didnt weigh or measure anything Im not totally sure how many calories I was eating but Id say it was in the    range.  During this period I was weight training x a week and running or swimming x a week and maintaining a loss of lbs a week.The last few weeks are a bit different because Ive been doing . hours of pretty vigorous exercise every day. Even though I havent been hungrier I found I was sleeping way way more than usual. While I love sleep this meant that other priorities in my life were suffering so I decided I needed to get this energy from elsewhere.  I added what is equivalent to a few hundred calories by eating either an avocado or a few eggs in the morning and an evening snack. This has worked to increase my stamina during the day but Ive still been losing lbs per week the last few weeks.Hope that helps! I look forward to tracking your journey! Im so happy you found keto  ,keto,d6dfp7h,1,t5_2rske

8601592,0,t3_4xk3uq,a better question is  how likelypossible is it to over eat when eating a correctly and well formulated ketogenic diet?if you are doing it correctly your appetite should virtually disappear.most ketogenic foods cause sever distress if over indulged. macadamia nuts will blow you out. its pretty hard to over do it on pure oil some attack coconut oil thoughmeat? maybe but the difference between a normal reasonable portion and over doing it is pretty wide.avocados? try eating more than one large one in a sitting and see how you feel.green vegetables and cruciferous veggies? go ahead and try to over eat these its pretty impossible. no one has been kicked out of ketosis by spinach.the fact is truly ketogenic foods cause distress when over eaten. either a physically too full discomfort or bowl related effects.IMO where people over eat of a keto diet is in the grey area fake low carb breads sugar alcohol garbage halo top ice cream etc.,keto,d6gsjvq,2,t5_2rske

Perhaps try drinking single vodkas next time  you wont need as much to get a buzz as you used to!Here are some of my handy tips for drinkingMake sure you have had your daily amount of electrolytes BEFORE drinking.Try and drink the occasional soft drink or water during drinking.Prepare an electrolyte drink BEFORE you go out. Put it in the fridge. When you get home get it out and drink it. I use electrolyte drops. I put double the amount in ml of water in a bottle and leave it in the fridge. When Im done drinking I down the bottle. Then I refill and take that to bed with me. Sometimes if I have the brains to do it I swallow  salt tablets too at bedtime.When you wake in the morning MORE ELECTROLYTE WATER!Electrolytes solve everything. And Ive got to say the longer I am in ketosis the better my coping with drink. The first few months of hangovers were hellish. Now Im pretty good with hangovers because I do the electrolyte thang religiously. I also think my tolerance has improved over the time over  year.,keto,d6nx9b4,2,t5_2rske

You cant expect to lose the weight using a lifestyle then change back to the lifestyle that caused you to gain weight and expect to stay fit. It wont happen.Of course once you hit your goal weight you can always introduce more calories on the proper diet to maintain your weight. Dieting is naturally more difficult because it requires you to at least deprive yourself a little bit so that you have a deficit vs. having some keto munchies here and there if you feel like it and are at weight is no big deal. ,keto,d6ofl5u,3,t5_2rske

8668742,0,t3_4yo2kt,Well if you just want to feel good having a keto friendly cheat day should help. By that I mean stay under the carb limit but throw out the calorie limit. Eat a fathead pizza bake KetOreos or pancakes etc. and pig out. Both times when I got a huge motivation boost was because there was a girl I wanted to date. The problem is motivation is fleeting especially when its based on another person but if you can turn keto into a routinelifestyle instead of viewing it as a temporary solution then it will be much easier. Discipline is the key I cheated and did lazy keto for a long time then I snapped one day May this year after a cheat day so now no matter how shitty I feel I wont cheat on carbs because the  minutes of joy it takes me to eat a pizza and a packet of Oreos turns into a week of regret. Id rather feel nothing than to feel bad about myself for a whole week. I also actually want to reach my goal. I dont do it for others but if Id have to give a speech about weightloss Id thank the first girl in it because she gave me the initial push I needed to stop being a fat.Hold yourself accountable as well I have a calendar and I mark each day I adhered to the diet and each day I ate more than g of carbs and if I went to work out. Im not perfect  was my beginner year  was shit for me I got a slim gf and I wanted her to gain weight all I did was eat all the leftovers because she stopped like after  slices of pizza plus my old habits kicked back in and I got lazy. I probably had more high carb days then low carb ones in that year and Im not ashamed to admit it. I gained back  kg about  lbs cheating isnt worth it. It will make you feel good in the moment but it will stall you waste your time and will make you feel regret at which point youll most likely cheat again and also it wont allow you to defeat cravings which should go away after a few weeks thus making it super hard to say no to sugar.gtgtgreen  keto day  red  non keto day  yellow  ketoworkoutSome form of physical activity can always put me in a good as well YMMV but its worth a try plus it might break your plateau.Why do you think its hard to stay strict keto? i.e. counting calories.

If you are eating enough but still hungry try taking BCAAs with water.  It is a widely known and safe supplement used mostly by bodybuilders.  It will trick your brain making it think you are getting sugar.  Plus it helps you burn less muscle when losing weight.  Pills work better for me but some people get it in powder form to add taste to water.  Cheers,keto,d6um2xl,1,t5_2rske

8785294,0,t3_50g91r,First of all Id recommend to take a look at this article I hope that this review and of course the numerous success stories in this subreddit are sufficient to show that a ketogenic diet has its uses. Of course some of the most welldocumented benefits of keto arent primarily about weight loss e.g. epilepsy treatment antiinflammatory effects. That said in regard to a diet for weight loss the main drawback of keto seems to be that it can feel more restrictive than other forms of diet and the major benefit is that it alleviates blood sugar spikes.In consequence a ketonic diet for the purpose of weight loss works best for people who a struggle with ravenous hunger due to blood sugar fluctuation and b whose personal taste doesnt go contrary to ketofriendly food.For example if you have relatively stable blood sugar anyway and if abstinence from fruits is not merely bothersome but a dramatic burden for you youll probably have a much easier time with another form of diet for weight loss and even though it doesnt fit the ketogenic diet plan nobody in their right mind would argue that apples are unhealthy food.,keto,d73u1sl,2,t5_2rske

There are also large amounts of weight dropped by people with a lot to lose who stick with it. The less you have to lose the slower it will be and depending on former diet you might not have a ton of water weigt to loseEven though you enter ketosis withing a couple of days your body isnt keto adapted and that can take several weeks at best. In other words your body has to learn to efficiently use fat for fuelIt seems like youve heard some stuff but you need to do some reading so you understand whats going onFAQ especially the part about electrolytes to avoid keto flu.Keto in a NutshellYou can set macros using the keto calculator Set activity to sedentary carbs to g protein to .glb lean mass calculator will estimate  body fat so go with that fat to   deficit.Protein is a goal but fat and carbs are upper limits. You get into ketosis by eating very low carb moderate protein and high fat  some of which comes from your body if losing weight.Your activity is gauged by working out how much exercise you get in a  hour period so a hard workout for an hour a day is possibly sedentary. I cannot see you going over lightly activeYou need to get your carbs down consistently. Id suggest that g net is your max.

You are correct that the  is  but the IF is similar to adding in a form of exercisenot exact to increase the deficit. Am I in error?

8882580,0,t1_d7firrh,Fasting is actually incredibly healthy. It gives your digestive system a time out. Its good for your gut flora. It also increases your lifespan it makes you healthier in general and every time oyu hear your belly growl from hunger or feel hungry this is the time when your body releases certain transmitters which repair and grow your brain. And its natural there are tribes that only eat once a day and often even dont eat for the entire day or even  days. Our ancestors for the most time didnt eat all day or even every day. When you did you feasted as much as possible to store the energy and not lose them to other animals or foulness etc. meals is unnatural its arbitrary its static and we are not static but dynamic and ambivalent beings. The only constant in this world is change but  meals a day is normal? Thats ridicolous.Did you see this video?

Tonight my girlfriend and I had to run some errands so I had a late dinner and kept it simple. I ate four eggs five sausage links and two strips of bacon with a few generous dashes of Texas Pete. Tomorrow morning Ill put a large chicken breast in the crockpot and cover it with spices cheese ranch and crumbled bacon. It will cook all day on low and then when I get home Ill shred the chicken with a fork and stir it all together and probably eat it with some roasted cauliflower or Brussels sprouts.

9099171,0,t3_54w9ba,I have read about this as I had the same fear...the slower metabolism. And actually once you lose weight....your smaller body does not need the higher metabolism to maintain the energy consumption. So your metabolism slows. Not like slows to the point where you become obese from eating....It does make it a little easier to gain weight when eating fries and burgers and shakes and cake and CRAP with a slower metabolism. Which we wouldnt eat on Keto anyways And then harder to get it off again. I mainly read the information for yoyo dieting and how is simply doesnt work. But your body slows because it is more efficient. More efficient at burning fat...so why would the body want to continue working quick and fast when you are efficient?? Keto is for sure a lifestyle and not a diet. If you chose to live the Keto lifestyle you really will be okay. I also saw a few commenters saying these people on the biggest loser had lost the weight way too fast.....I totally agree that this is the reason for them gaining it back. That show is not healthy and I dont know why anyone would watch it. Im sure those peoples bodies are in shock from losing  pounds in a few months. If you eat Keto and workout to build a little muscle. You will be fine. I do cardio and body movements with little  pound dumb bells  days a week.

9103299,0,t3_54yit9,Dont worry about getting enough fat if your other macros are okay.  Your goal should be ltg net carbs and at least .g protein per pound of lean mass.  Fat is there to make up the remaining balance until you hit your calorie limit andor feel full.  If you feel satisfied and youve had enough protein no need to force yourself to down more fat.There is no need to eat carbs before workout unless you are doing something extremely intense.  The vast majority of people do not need it.  Definitely wait until youre fully adapted  weeks before you even consider experimenting with adding carbs before workout.Quest bars have sugar alcohols which also do not count towards net carbs although they do contain calories.  BTW if you like them you should try Kirkland Costco brand protein bars.  They are cheaper and even lower in net carbs.,keto,d862joe,1,t5_2rske

I mean Im not going to sit here and give up if I go out with some buddies and drink some beers and have some of the nachos the table ordered.  Move on maybe stay with Jack and Diets the rest of the night and keep that train going.  But part of it is that Im at a point now where Im lbs under my goal weight and at this point its become somewhat neurotic where I feel the need to get every ounce of fat off my body partially just because this diet has shown me that I can do it if I stay disciplined.  Really its just to push myself to see how far I can go with this. And really at this point its not hard to stay diciplined either because its so intertwined with my every day routine that its more of a habit and it would be hard to break it.  Even when I cheat other than a few instances its going up to like  carbs because I feel the incessant need to stay away from really heavy carb stuff.

Buy in bulk and on sale whenever you have the money.  Freeze what you arent using right away. Or cook enough for the week which is better when you are busy big bags of frozen mixed veg no cornbeans heads of lettuce cucumbers tomatoes within limits  a big bag of deli pepperoni for quick snacking bouillon  broth with veg and an egg or plain  plus the usual eggs hardboiled in salads scrambled over easy with broccoli scoops or used in hollandaise over...everything.   I used oilampvinegar salad dressing with a little lite salt and homemade mayo instead of store dressings.  If I hit the sales right than there was usually enough left for a block cheese pickles for the sodium and snack crunch and some cheap cuts of pork.

All studies that link it used people eating bacon with the standard American diet load of  carbs per day mostly from grain. We already know that saturated fat is bad with a high carb load but good in absence of the high carb load. Perhaps the nitrites are benign for us as well.

9181883,0,t3_562lna,I nearly gave up in the first  weeks when I saw no progress on the scale after the initial water weight dump.  Thankfully I stuck with it because thats about when things really took off for me.  Initial adaptation period is different for everyone and my personal outlook on things is that the first  weeks is all about reprogramming your lifestyle more than counting pounds and should be spent enjoying the food and focusing on expanding your recipe arsenal.Mileage will vary but I paid no attention at all to macros and I was likely overeating as I tried to drown my carb cravings with fat.  My appetite took care of itself eventually after that initial period and I soon found that I was naturally carrying a caloric deficit without much effort beyond ensuring I was eating enough fat day to day.  I noticed little things after a while such as only being able to eat  eggs before I felt satiated when previously it took . Or simply forgetting to eat lunch because I just wasnt physically hungry.  At dinner Id often have to work to make sure I consumed enough fat for the day because I simply didnt need food at lunch time. Its been over  years for me and Ive maintained my weight successfully   lbs.  I now use keto as a tool to reign things in if I see my weight climb upward toward the  mark but I bounce in and out of the lifestyle as needed.  Ive started working out and exercising more recently so Ill have to start thinking more about macro mix more.  I want to finish what Ive started  months ago and build muscle and be truly lean before I enter my s.  Im applying a lot more discipline in my approach now than ever before but up until now for me it was never needed. The most important factor for success is patience during initial adaptation  however long it takes  and a healthy dose of skepticism when reading labels and considering risky things like artificial sweeteners and low carb packaged foods.,keto,d8fvdj3,1,t5_2rske

Together with other major shifts that occurred in human nutrition this increase in NAS consumption coincides with the dramatic increase in the obesity and diabetes epidemics. Our findings suggest that NAS may have directly contributed to enhancing the exact epidemic that they themselves were intended to fight.Coming from a wellrespected peerreviewed scientific journal this is a claim which should give us all pause.,keto,d8ith6g,1,t5_2rske

And lately my parents have been eating way too carelessly these past couple of years. ie chinese takeout every week large costco pizza fried chicken.. etc. definitely living the american lifestyle. The good thing is that hes always active in his work and home. He also used to do a lot of weight lifting back in his younger years. So he still has some good muscle.

If you dedicate some effort in trying new recipes youre going to find one that you LOVE. Here is my go to recipe that I eat EVERY week because its sooooo good.in fact that whole ruled.me website is ALL keto. so have a blast. Dont forget the sidebar links they also have useful stuff.The hardest part of keto for me is the social aspect. Going to restaurants etc.Cooking all of your meals will be the best bet in staying compliant. You will also save money this way. In terms of eating out? You really have to know what restaurant you can eat from. McDonalds? Goodluck with that. But a nice burger joint? Maybe you can order a burger in a bowl. Thats what I do. Pretty much Fastfood is Over with. Some people find ways to order this crap in keto fashion but I dont recommend it.I still get drunk and party while on keto but I use vodka and sugar free chasers. This isnt fullproof as your body uses the alcohol when its in your system but it is the best way to do it.The perception you should have about food is thisVeggies are my friend because they are simply a vessel for the FATSo I take brussel sprouts cut them in half and sauteed them with a chopped up ENTIRE PACKAGE OF BACON!!! Or Ill make broccoli and dump a bunch of fats in it like olive oil or cheese.Another quick cheap and Keto thing I do is Pork Rind Chips dipped in Guacamole!!

You and others have been very helpful drawing the lines between the differences for soy products. My main worry was more for my wife who is a high risk for breast cancer and most soy byproducts contain isoflavones which in that realm are a red flag so I try to be careful.

After the addaptation period  weeks to several months they become unreliable for nutritional ketosis because your body uses ketones more efficiently and does not dump them into urine. They might be showing false negative.If you are doing keto for weight loss you need to set up macros see right column on this page. You need to track proteins because you need a certain minimum limit that you would not be losing muscle mass. ,keto,d9w74f8,1,t5_2rske

I love the dairy too but it seems like a lot of websites say that cutting dairy helps cut weight.I dont want to be too critical of what youre eating because first Im not an expert. But second I feel like the most critical thing when starting is to get accustomed to a new way to eating. My goals were really eat a meal with low carb foods until I was satisfied. Then eat another one when hungry up to xday. I didnt track carbs protein or fat. I was just mainly focused on breaking my addiction to sugar and starch products and learning how to eat new foods.Probably the best thing you can do is just be patient.Within  weeks Id say I noticed that my clothes were feeling differently and I just felt like I was losing weight.

9705777,0,t3_5e38po,Well shit. I worked in eyecare for gt years saw it happen many times that blood sugar in diabetic and pregnant patients changed visual acuity. I never put the diet thing together with that info. I worked as an ophthalmic biometrist so I measured eyeballs to calculate for lens implants. Its the curvature of the cornea and lens thickness that bend the light so that it converges right on the retina that gives clear vision. Steeper corneas thinner lenses and longer eyeballs are factors in myopia. I know from having my own eyes measured that my corneas are flatter than expected for a myopic person but my eyes are longer this was done preketo  maybe  years ago. I also know I was a junk food junkie as a kid. Damnit! I did this to myself with cheetos and captain crunch. Maybe. But in diabetic and pregnant individuals if the BS is  brought under control the vision usually returns to its previous state. The article relates carb consumption with lengthened eyeballs but that does not seem like a reasonable explanation for the more transient refractory changes in the adult diabetic pregnant person. Before I read the article I was assuming corneal swelling might explain it. Damn this seems so obvious to me now and probably anyone that has worked in eyecare that it seems really dumb this hasnt been better studied.,keto,da9g18i,4,t5_2rske

My family has wanted me to lose weight for so long.  I have been overweight at least I started to notice when I was .  I am currently .  I have been in decent shape Freshman year of high school because of football and Junior year because of diet.  All that has fallen through I stopped playing football and soccer in high school and my diet fell apart quickly.  Since my junior year of high school I would occasionally do a diet for  days and then get back to my old habits.  YOU WILL NOT LOSE WEIGHT UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT! I learned this lesson myself not with weight loss first but with cigarettes. I used to smoke half a pack of cigarettes until July  when I quit.  Finally August  comes around I felt like shit going to bed I would have stomach pain and bloating when I would go to sleep I would sometimes wake up puking in my mouth from over eating.  I would wake up tired and feel groggy all day especially when I would eat carbs...  My sister came back from her vacation over seas I had my last meals and I began my keto diet August th.  Since then I have lost  pounds and am now down to !  I wanted to lose the weight I want to lose more.  I want to be skinny I want to go to the beach and the pool without feeling the need to have to wear a shirt.  I have seen one of my good friends go from  pounds to  pounds before my eyes.  I have seen the results in person I have seen the results from people all over the internet and lastly I have seen the results in the mirror.  I have pictures of my weight loss every  weeks.  Next one coming Thanksgiving day! IT WORKS!!!  I am proof my friend is proof!  I hope that after I get down to  pounds I can help a family friend out since he will see the results before his eyes.

9711313,0,t3_5e6gnn,Initially starting Keto I lost  lbs in  days but it was my start goal to begin IF the week before Thanksgiving. I was stuck at that lbs lost for nearly  weeks. Turns out I had lost enough to readjust my macros. It also happened to almost be my fasting start date. I cut cals from appx  to  and adjusted my macros according to Keto calculator. This was on . I do  combined with strict Keto now. One week in and so far it has been amazing to say the least. With  IF Im eating my  deficit of  cal   T W F Sa S and I eat  calories on M and Th. Today is the start of week  and Im down . lbs since I started on the th for a total of . lost. On my fasting days I find it easiest to eat one meal so I break my fast around  or pm. Throughout the day I supplement mag and I drink black coffee and Powerade Zero spiked with nusalt. The best part of IF and Keto is that I dont feel much hunger at all.  My husband has lost lbs since January on  IF only. He consumes his  cals throughout the day and is hangry by pm and in bed early to resist late night temptation. I on the other hand dont even think about food and have tons of energy all day long. Im getting the same good results hes seen but Im so much happier every day of the week.

Chicken broth or almonds helped me recover whenever I felt weak and also I included Magnesium complements twice per day.

Ive never used a regular blender though and I dont boil. I just take a bag of frozen cauliflowera pound I think and put it in a sauce pan with half a stick of butter some garlic and spices I usually use basil salt and pepper but really whatever you like will work fine. Cover and cook on medlow ish heat till its soft enough to just mush it with a fork.I should add that I use nonstick pans cooking it this way without a nonstick pan would probably burn it to the pan. I dont own any pans that arent nonstick because I cant be trusted with them Ill fuse food to them permanently and have to throw them out then i throw in half a stick of cream cheese and stirmashsquish it around the pan with a spoon or use an immersion blender right in the pan. Sometimes I throw in some cheese cheddar mozzarella whatever I have but really the cream cheese butter and seasonings are enough. Ive also done it with a mix of broccoli cauliflower and spinachalso carrots but theyre a bit too carby when dieting or just cauliflower and spinach and its even better.

Your body releases insulin due to hormonal triggers not because you taste something sweet. You want to pick artificial sweeteners that are both carb and provoke no glycemic index reaction as some carb sweeteners have a higher GI than even normal sugar. Also it must be noted that every body is different. Some people have issues even on safe sweeteners while others dont. You just have to try and see. Check out this thread ,keto,dcgsa5b,2,t5_2rske

10354231,0,t3_5o953v, talk to yr dr. or nutritionist. About which foods will help sugar lows without over correcting. Maybe prep a correction meal of a small glass of oj two string cheese sticks and a handful of almonds. The oj to quickly address the sugar need almonds have some carb and the string cheese to buy you some time and fill up while not hurting macros. do all you can to be self aware when you are correcting a sugar low. Start with just a few ounces of oj or some raisins and give it  min. Then check and see where you are if you are insulin dependent diabetic keto diet likely will greatly reduce the need for insulin as carb is restricted so much. You may need to adjust medications down to stay in pace with the lower amount of dietary carb. Also insulin itself triggers hunger and the blood sugar low exacerbates the hunger response with insulin  so getting to the point where you can reduce your baseline doses as well as the mealtime doses should help. With some luck discipline and adjustment you will likely experience MUCH greater blood sugar control with keto. best of luck in making it work! I know how panicky you can feel when dealing with lows. Keeping your cool is of utmost importance. Again if in doubt call the dr,keto,dchpnwg,2,t5_2rske

What works is staying low carb eating adequate protien and eating fat to satiety.  Many start out eating higher fats as we adapt to getting energy from protien and fat rather than the constant demands of carbs we relied on before. If you insist on eating oatmeal cereal bread and starches  eating higher fats and protien will only add calories to be stored as fat.,keto,dckhb4w,2,t5_2rske

10470688,0,t1_dcuy0s7,If you understand what Leptin resistance is then youll know why they would have to eat more.  Leptin resistance manifests itself in  ways either constantly eating past satiation or constantly not eating enough caloric restriction.  When Leptin resistance hits it skews the signalling to the brain making it think were starving and it puts a death grip on the fat stores.  That means no fat loss.  Leptin stores need to be replenished and that only happens by increasing calories if its done via caloric restriction.  If its done via overeating which by comparison it rarely is compared to caloric restriction theyd benefit from a brief but large caloric restriction.  A lot of people neglect this when they engage in caloric restriction.  Do it for too long and there are major consequences.To put it into perspective xmas of  I was completely stalled eating  daily and this happened for months.  So during that time I increased my calories to between  daily and within  weeks I dropped lbs.People need to keep in mind there will be days they eat more and days they eat less.  Calorie expenditure isnt linear it changes daily and hourly given a host of factors which Im not going to list here.  At the end of the week perhaps TDEE averages out to be the same like  calories maintenance but that doesnt mean a persons TDEE is  calories every single day.  Some days higher some days lower.  Ignoring hunger signals over the long haul trying to abide by fictitious daily TDEE can cause Leptin Resistance.With that said I edited my original post to her that its likely not Leptin resistance but Cortisol causing her problem.  At her stats its likely her exercise frequency is causing Cortisol to elevate pulling up her blood sugar which is causing more insulin to be released blocking fat burning.,keto,dcuykjx,1,t5_2rske

10510262,0,t3_5q7ngx,I have a Dachshund as well and tried feeding him a homemade diet for a few months. Heres a few things I learned.Dog diets are very different from human diets. They require different ratiosnutrients than humans. Its very difficult to get all of those nutrients through normal cookable foods alone. You may have to supplement in various ways.Make sure you are doing regular bloodwork with your vet to make sure there are no problems with deficiencies.Portion sizes are very key when giving your dog their food. I found my dog would stop eating his food because the portions to meet his nutrition was too large to finish in one meal and you cant leave cooked food sitting in his bowl for the whole day.Make sure their eating bowls and area is cleaned regularly. You arent dealing with dry food anymore so the chance for bacteria to grow on their food if left out is much greater.Overall I decided the time money and effort to eliminate a small portion of starches from his diet wasnt really worth it in the end. Ive found a food he enjoys and I am comfortable giving him. I make sure to share some of my meals with him as well at least the proteinveggie portion.Hes very lean for a Dachshund and I havent had any issues keeping him that way. Limiting treats and getting plenty of exercise to me are of greater value than going all natural for food.,keto,dczg7e0,1,t5_2rske

Both consisted of roller coastering  lbs around a set number and when the plateau was over my weight started to come off regularly again. Us who weigh daily have to look at the larger data set we get VS the micro data we see every day in the morning or whenever you weigh yourself. when you look at the big picture you can easily see how your weight is trending and if it is negative or positive...in the end as long as you are still averaging out with a negative loss then you are good. and i myself have never done anything to try and end the stalls i just deal and keep doing what ive been doing. ,keto,ddadxpl,2,t5_2rske

I bought wool socks and long underwear for the first time in  years.  Im not sure if its the ketosis or just  lbs less insulation.  Probably a bit of both.  When you have excess glucose stored in your muscle tissue it holds a lot of water....that is the water weight you can loose at the start.

But after a month or so you will need to pull the reigns in if you want to get the full benefits. In the end nothing short of a lifestyle change is going to keep the weight off.You want to keep stuff like mug cake and low carb bread to an absolute minimum. I wouldnt even use it as a treat rewarding yourself with food isnt really good practice anyway. Use it if you get so carbcrazy that you will drive to the store and eat a bunch of junk on the spot substitutes are better than doing that at least. You are tricking your brain into thinking that eating chocolate and bread is ok naturally it is going to want more and could harm your weight loss efforts in the long run especially when you switch back to a balanced diet after losing weight.I really dont want to discourage you because youre definitely on the right path. I was where you are  months ago and the difference is stark. Im  years old morbidly obese all my adult life and I thought I had abysmal will power but it turned out to just be a carb addiction.

10696558,0,t3_5sz5si,During the first three days your body hasnt properly adapted to using fat or ketones so a heavy workout will probably deplete most of your spare glucoseglycogen you have around and make you feel like crap. You also lose a lot of water so make sure youre drinking an extra liter or two per day.Assuming theres no other underlying issue this should gradually pass as your body gets fully adapted during the coming weeks.If you want to get your ketone levels down you can just eat some carbs sugar might be the best option as the fructose will preferably get processed by the liver and thus likely inhibits ketone production a bit better short post on ketone production You can try  grams spread out over the day usually people see lower ketones gradually as they increase carb levels and around g people anecdotally usually start having trouble with staying in ketosis. But if youre active its probably closer to  grams before you get kicked out.gt The CNS and brain are the largest consumers of glucose on a daily basis requiring roughly  grams of glucose per day . ...gt As stated previously is appears the primary purpose of ketones in humans is to provide the brain with a nonglucose fatderived fuel for the brain ....gt From the third day of ketosis to three weeks of fasting the brain gradually increases its use of ketones for fuel ultimately deriving up to  of its total energy from ketones ....gt As described previously muscles will derive up to  of their energy requirements from ketones during the first few days of ketosis. However this drops rapidly and by the third week of ketosis muscles derive less only  of their energy from ketone bodies ....gt The primary adaptation is an overall shift in fuel utilization from glucose to FFA in most tissues as discussed in the previous section . This shift spares what little glucose is available to fuel the brain.The Ketogenic Diet by Lyle McDonald page .,keto,ddj9qq8,1,t5_2rske

You can be on keto and still have problems with IBS though these usually come in the form of eating high FODMAP veggies like broccoli avocado and garlic and certain types of dairy.

Also dont stop eating I know it sounds pretty basic but once again personally if you dont eat for a while youre more inclined to go for crappy food once you get hungry enough and it ends up being a downward spiral.

10758238,0,t3_5twgf8,These are two totally different things.  Ketoforce is snake oil brain octane is regular oil The basic outline of ketosis is that you break down both fats and carbs into vinegar.  If you break down fats without carbs you run low on a sort of vinegarwheelbarrow Coenzyme A and have to combine vinegars into ketones to free up some wheelbarrows.  Adding ketones ketoforce doesnt benefit you ketones are a side effect of restricting carbs and forcing your body to unpack stored fat.  Brain octane OTOH is a fat thats fastlaned into vinegar conversion so its useful for two things sparing protein during the first few weeks youre adjusting to ketosis and a relatively quick energy burst otherwise.,keto,ddpmrzf,1,t5_2rske

I also try to walk to work most days which is another  miles round trip so I try to be very cognizant of hydrating and electrolytes since I live in Las Vegas. Heres what I do I salt my food using a low sodium salt product I use Himalania reduced sodium salt which generally has a bunch of potassium in it. I dont love overly salty food but if you do this is a simple way to add more sodium amp potassium. I have a large hydroflask that I add  Tbsp lemon juice   tsp Himalania reduced sodium salt. I occasionally I add another  tsp Himalania or open a magnesium capsule and dump it in in which case I find its a little strong for me and will add  Splenda packet or whatever sweetener packet I recently swiped from Starbucks.  I take a magnesium supplement every day  mg and a few days a week pop an extra one. When I take two I take one in the morning and one in the afternoon or add the second to my water. I drink a cup of bone broth daily  that I make myself. My broth usually has long bones with marrow and some kind of joint to maximize the types of nutrients that Im getting. Ive straddled the paleoketo worlds for years and have yet to experience keto flu.

After all most of them were probably pretty in line with the government guidelines of high carb low fat. It takes a lot of work to sift through all of the misinformation out there. A former coworker of mine was seriously obese and he walked  miles every day. At the time I couldnt figure out how someone who walked  miles every day could have a weight problem especially one as bad as his. Granted he said it took him about an hour but so much of what you read says  minutes of activity a day for good health. If you take that at face value he was on target.The reality is that walking  miles at a slow pace burns about  calories or one bagel with cream cheese. The intent of my post was an anecdotal observation that we are overall a misinformed population buying our food at stores that gladly give us what we want and the result is a lot of overweight people.,keto,ddqgch4,1,t5_2rske

Youre almost certainly eating more than you think youre eating.  I found out when I started weighing everything that I was putting a lot more cream in my coffee than I thought and I was drinking a lot of coffee.  So Id fill my cup with coffee put it on the scale hit tare then weigh the amount of cream I added.  Bingo.  You wont have the exact same problem but whatever it is youll find it.  Weigh the meat the cheese the tomato sauce the toppings and put them into a recipe in your food tracker. Thatll give you the total amounts for the entire recipe.  Then make the serving size oz or g either one will work.  When you dish up a serving weigh that serving and if its g enter it as  servings.  It looks pretty silly but itll give you a really accurate count of the exact macronutrients in your meal.Its a real pain on the first day I know but after a few days it becomes part of your routine and it only takes a few extra seconds per meal.

Exercise as soon as you feel up to it. It could be a few days maybe a week or two. Everyones experience is different when getting your body used to using fat for fuel rather than glucose. Youll know it when your body has made the switch as youll get a sudden boost of energy. Exercise during the initial phase is not harmful but it may just be harder than normal.

I also walked a lot went to exercise classes etc. but I ate carbs and was never really thin.  Over the last  years I have gained approximately  pounds per year getting me to the point that I am now.  I stopped exercising about  years ago and my carb cravings just kept increasing.  I talked to my son a few days ago about how I cant believe how much weight I have gained since he was  years old.  When he pointed out to me that it was about  pounds a year I understood HOW I got to this point.  Gaining  pounds in a year is not that noticeable.  But it keeps adding up.  All because of carbs.  I have other health problems from it as well.  But I am reversing all of that.  My weight has actually dropped from what it is in my stats but I have decided I am going to just update it once a month and not weigh every day.  Congratulations on your success!!!!

11056014,0,t1_deko4d9,Ill jump in here.. first a question! How much do you need to eat daily? Thats going to help you figure out how much you need to be eating per meal regardless of which one.For example according to the keto calculator Im need to eat around  calsday to lose weight. I use that as sort of a blueprint to plan out my meals.  split across  meals is roughly  calories per meal assuming no snacking. Personally I aim for around  calories for breakfast and then eat about  or so at lunch and dinner. Breakfast is either bulletproof coffee T each coconut oil and unsalted grassfed butter and an egg or some nuts OR a full hot breakfast with eggs bacon avocado and maybe sauteed veggies of some sort.As a past Weight Watchers member I know I know.. I have always been very dependent on snacking to keep me from literally starving between meals. Keto is different. If youre truly hungry less than about ish hours after a meal youre simply not eating enough fat to keep you satiated. You may not be drinking enough water. Thirstdehydration can feel like hunger too. eggs is a great start! Maybe consider adding half an avocado or meat of some kind. Or a nice big omelet or scramble with some veggies and cheese. Or say screw breakfast food and eat leftovers from dinner! Sorry for the long reply.. I hope its at least somewhat helpful!Edit grammar,keto,del6ijp,1,t5_2rske

I know you are only drinking Friday and Saturday for now but as you said you are craving alcohol during the week as well and there is great risk of you becoming an everyday drinker. If you start binge drinking every day you will become physically dependent on alcohol and you dont want to get yourself into that situation. Its absolutely horrible to wake up sick every morning because you need a drink. Also alcohol withdrawal can have fatal side effects. I would reach out to someone you trust and talk to them about it. Having support can really make a huge difference. Good luck!,keto,desjx4d,2,t5_2rske

Did you do the calculator? Did it say that was a higher deficit? You could be eating  or  per day and be much happier and still lose weight.

11160964,0,t1_dewy712,Everything should be fine the following is a quote from the FAQResults vary but you will typically go through three phases Honeymoon Lots of weight comes off fast. This is water that was tied up with glycogen. Note if you dont experience rapid weight loss in this period do not despair. Not everyone is so lucky and men may be more likely to see rapid initial weight loss than women. Keto Adaptation Water and glycogen find a new balance and this causes a stall or even weight gain which lasts for a week or two. Relax this is both normal and temporary. Fully ketoadapted After  weeks the body is burning fat as its main fuel and the brain has switched to running on ketones. A bumpy downward trend in your weight will begin. The trend is bumpy because there will be days or weeks when your weight stalls or even goes up slightly. This happens to everyone on every kind of weightloss diet. Please dont post to rketo that you gained a pound or two or plateaued for a week. The trend will be especially bumpy if you are female. In particular shark week will play hell with your scale weight.If a plateau lasts more than a couple of weeks you may need to make adjustments to your lifestyle to break it. See the plateau section.So youre most likely in the adaptation phase. Additionally the last sentence is important The natural fluctuation of body weight is quite big so I would only worry if nothing happens after several weeks assuming your macros are in order which seems to be the case.Keep calm and keto on and good luck ,keto,dex30em,3,t5_2rske

I have to spend much more time than Id care to admit on the computer. Between running tournaments and school my weekends are pretty jam packed. I am a busy person these days so I try to fit in my little amounts of exercise when I can.

11263716,0,t3_60rfiy,I did a carb refeed because I lift everyday. I regret I did it because I have been struggling to get back on keto. If your will power is stronger than mine go for it. After the refeed i felt bloated and heavy depending on what type carb  but strong in the gym. It does take several days to get down to the weight you were at before the refeed. If you decide to do carb refeed make sure to eat lean protein and a lots of clean carbs otherwise it will be counterproductive. Listen to your body. st time when I did carbload i ate regular keto food through out the day and salmon fillet at night then I ate rice cakes and icecream. I felt like shit. I was literally on my kitchen floor and rubbing my belly. I made a mistake by eating too much fatty food and sugar. That is why I felt shitty. nd time.  I ate several times a day. Lean protein and clean LOw GI carbs. Oats rice rice cake and toast. I felt really good through out the day. The next day I woke looking bigger but better.

If you absolutely cannot do that I personally recommend you to overestimate your food intake overestimate carb and underestimate fat intake. That allows you to reduce caloric and carb intake and increase fat intake.

Those type of posts happen all the time with people posting in a panic because they think they have been kicked out of Ketosis and dont know why. On the flip side getting kicked out of Ketosis sometimes causes Ketones to flush out resulting in a positive test even though you are currently not in Ketosis. That is another common post where someone has a massive carb cheat then posts saying they are still in Ketosis so it is all good even though they are not. Ketostrips are useless for determining nutritional Ketosis simply because a positivenegative test does not mean you currently are innot in Ketosis.,keto,dfij2cx,2,t5_2rske

11368883,0,t1_dfk2o8d,Any amount of fasting is going to be beneficial. While you still generally need to meet your nutrition goals the more time spent fasting the better. The benefits dont so much come from consistency in when you do it each day or week but from how long you fast for in aggregate. I have found that longer fasting periods with shorter feeding windows generally leads to faster weight loss and feeling better overall personally. The reason its been effective on my goals is simply because I have sustained IF daily since midDecember.If you want to understand more about it here is a really great video you can watch.The purpose of changing based on how I feel is all about making it sustainable. If I feel like Im starving myself all the time with any diet or strategy Im not going to stick with it. Ive tried many times in the past and failed. I can make keto  IF work because Im not really denying myself all the time. I dont have to exercise great will power. If I feel like Im really hungry or craving something then I eat something and just try to make sure its a healthy choice. Not necessarily what Im craving but something that satisfies the craving.,keto,dfkn308,1,t5_2rske

11380011,0,t1_dflw6lk,gt But I just dont think we evolved to eat a lot of grains and starch and other modern agricultural phenomenonEating meat allowed hominids to evolve into early humans and develop frontal cortices but your argument is a naturalistic fallacy. There are hundreds if not thousands of regionallocal diets that evolved with specific populations many of which are primarily vegetarian. One of my biggest qualms with keto is a diet that is heavily reliant on animal agriculture especially for those like me who cant afford nonfactory farmed foods. With the amount of cancer and cardiovascular research on highly processed meats cheeses fats etc. you could make the same evolutionary argument about many modern diets.Im just leery of the echo chambers that develop in this subreddit about the evilness of carbs.

The most common bread consumed by Sardinian shepherds is a dry flat bread made of highprotein lowgluten Triticum durum wheat the main ingredient in Italian pasta. They eat wheat from Neolith. Also they use live lactobacilli rather than yeast to rise the dough. This process also converts sugars and gluten into lactic acid lowering the breads glycemic index and imparting a pleasant faintly sour taste. This type of bread is able to lower the glycemic load reducing aftermeal glucose and insulin blood levels by  percent. This helps protect the pancreas and may help prevent obesity and diabetes..They use goats and sheeps milk dairy and I sure they eat those goats and sheeps. Also fish and other seafood sardines for example. So Sardinian diet is rather low carbs diet.gt small percentage of the population experience intestinal problems from whole grains as a result of what scientists are now calling nonceliac wheat sensitivity isnt small percentage.

11499762,0,t1_dfypbs8,Firstly thanks and apologies for not spending enough time researching prior to posting. I guess when youre anxious kneejerk reaction is to get the fastest answer which generally is to ask someone. Although you have helped ease my concerns. I think my anxiety was coming from the fact that I didnt see any cases that were at the level of what I was at and whether or not they would proceed to reduce. As you mentioned that it could pull through from  months I guess just keep calm.ampnbspampnbspTo answer your questions Unfortunately I didnt take a baseline check and wishing I did prior to Keto. I fasted from pm day before til am which was when the test was Im unsure if thats long enough but I hadnt eaten that day and had an early dinner.ampnbsp Unsure as to what constiutes to active body fat loss are there certain levels? But to say the least it is active. On a week I may potentially lose up to grams.  Macros I do not entirely hit them everyday but in the case I dont case its more of under than over. My lifestyle to explain is typical of an desk jockey. Sitting majority of the day. Prior to keto I lifted  days a week with the occasional minute walk now I do  times a week on a x program to simplify the workout process.ampnbspWhat I eat is more or less simple. I dont try and create complex meals. Basically itsampnbsp Breakfast. eggs  bacon with mushrooms or spinach. LunchDinnerProteinranges from grams  vegetablesspinach  additional fat depending how I feel this is really either a choice of cheese or avocadoProtein sources include mincecut of pork beef chickenIf I feel lazy canned sardines or tuna with olive oil. cook with olive oil predominantly but started to include butter into the process.I drink one cup of coffee everyday.

Change in tastes improved sleep after little sleep when first starting sometimes a spontaneous desire to startincrease exercise.  Another one that is harder to gauge is that once you become ketoadapted your brainbody will attempt to resist switching back into glucose burning mode a bit more so if you do have some more carbs they will be preferentially shunted into glycogen stores with little carb craving effect.  Unfortunately too much or too soon and it just becomes a cheat meal with the usual side effects. days straight will not get you into ketoadaptation.  That time frame is set more to help you develop new habits and overcome carb cravings which you have not done.,keto,dfzv8f4,2,t5_2rske

Been through things that dont work make me feel like gunk et cetera et cetera but technically speaking all ways of eating still work by the CICO design. Its false when people say calories dont matter. They do. Even here they do.If you come to us a few months down the line and say you gained weight or havent lost any weight while in ketosis well tell you to adjust your macros accordingly to be at a higher caloric deficit.What you are saying now is literally not what you were saying before. Just get your macros count your calories and youll lose weight. Restrict the calories too to be in ketosis.There are plenty of other ways of eating that work for people and they can be perfectly healthy happy and not be in ketosis.

In skincare sugar alcohols are used as humectants to draw and bind water to your skins surface cells as one of  main mechanisms of moisturizing action. The other  main classes of moisturizing ingredients are emollients lubricating surface of skin and occlusives which protectform a barrier against moisture loss.Most Western moisturizers combine some of each type of moisturizing ingredient to create a robust and wellrounded skincare product.

There is a natural tendency to eat large amounts of food as soon as the fast is over. Interestingly most people dont actually describe overwhelming hunger but more of a psychological need to eat. Overeating right after fasting may lead to stomach discomfort. While not serious it can be quite uncomfortable.  This problem tends to be selfcorrecting.gtTry breaking your fast with a handful of nuts or a small salad to start. Then wait for  minutes. This will usually give time for any waves of hunger to pass and allow you to gradually adjust. Short duration fasts  hours or less generally require no special breaking of the fast but certainly for longer fasts it is a good idea to plan ahead.,keto,dghyaxm,1,t5_2rske

11707204,0,t3_67151t,Re as strict as possible for some people thats a nice way of saying Im super strict but nobody is infallible while for others it might mean they use salad dressing from the salad bar and estimate carbs because it would be impossible to the know the carbs for an unknown brand of dressing. Unless you were already thin  days in with both no weight loss sounds AND nothing on ketostix sounds very unusual to me. Im not saying to rely on ketostix but since both of these indicators are unchanged my opinion is it could mean you have carbs sneaking in in prepared food or the MFP inputs are wrong somehow.Any tips  I would try  days of being super strict with your carbs well under  and keep your protein low its just  days.  Its okay to up your fat intake if you are hungry.  See what happens with weight ketostix and more importantly how you feel.  Unless... Please do not follow my advice if you are not actually overweight.  Also if you are overweight and doing this will make you fall off the keto wagon dont do it.  But since youve already done  days I think you can do  more super strict days and it will be well worth seeing what happens.Finally lots of people post here who havent seen the FAQ and Keto in a Nutshell because it can be hard to find on mobile.

I have lost lbs so far this year on keto and it took me  years on a nonketo diet to lose lbs before that. I am still considered obese right now and I dont think my weight loss has been at an unhealthy pace but the more I lose the more feedback I get that keto is too extreme. So I find myself just agreeing that I need some carbs and when I do go off keto for a second I make sure everyone knows and I tell them I feel just fine about it so they will lay off me.

Cant say eating fruit with cheese has done a whole lot for me though even though its tasty and I do it daily. Glad that it is considered keto.I eat about x a day its ridiculous. I eat all the foods the primary Dr suggested I eat  meats vegetables fiber fruit nuts peanut butter etc  and what Ive noticed is there seems to be some kind of disconnect where my body doesnt realize Ive eaten. Because I can eat a nice big meal of chicken and vegetables skip the carbs and while Im sitting there physically feeling that my stomach has food in it I still feel shaky and I still have the burning hunger feeling in my throat and stomach. I dont mean burning like acid I mean burning like I am empty plz eat even though there is already food ingested. Its really weird. I dont remember the last time I ate and felt just nice and satisfied and not toofull and bloated or notfullenough and still hungry.

An egg has . carbs so I spend g on breakfast.For lunch I would have a sandwich on Josephs Flax Oat bran and whole wheat pita. g net carbs. Id use lunch meats egg salad or chicken salad I made myself. Depending on what I put in it Id spend about g of carbs. Ill tell you what this bread really helps me too. I use one piece and if I am using lunch meats I just use it as a flat bread. If it is egg or chicken salad I use it as a pita and stuff it.Dinner was usually a chicken breast or a pork chop cooked on a hot cast iron pan with a bit of Tony Chacheras Creole seasoning amazing on chops and some sliced summer squash sauteed and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese.Sometimes Id cook a bunch of pork chops and bring those to work for lunch. Id bring no more than a serving of wasabi or siracha almonds for a snack if I needed it or a baby bell cheese.Last weekend I smoked some baby back ribs and a boston butt. I brought in some of those leftovers a couple days in a row and drove people crazy with the smell. Ate them with collard greens cooked in bacon and some hot sauce. Another good snack is slice some jalepeno peppers lengh wise scrape out the seeds stuff with cream cheese and wrap with bacon pop it in a  degree oven until the bacon looks done. Philadelphia brand has a spreadable cream cheese with chives. I think that one works best. It is easy to blow your carbs on this snack though. You can also throw these on a grill.

11794096,0,t3_689xv4,You dont need to increase carbs. More ketones wont really make a difference harm you etc. Of course as you get used to being in ketosis monitoring your ketone levels would be useful to gauge your tolerance to carbohydrates. This means that you may be able to add carbs to your daily above the standard g if you wanted to. It would be purely a desirepreference thing. I dont measure blood ketones but I notice that I am quite sensitive to carbs and have to be careful about my protein intake. I can tell when Im not in ketosis and Ive noticed it doesnt take much above g to kick me out. If I could still be in ketosis at g Id eat the shit out of those extra carbs! That would mean more tomato sauce for my meatballs! Yay! But view ketosis as ketosis. If youre in ketosis at g if youre in ketosis at g its all the same. As far as Ive read it wont really make a difference if youre g or g as long as you are in ketosis.

11797186,0,t1_dgwjzvx,gtI avoided doctors mostly because of that all your problem are related to your weight mentality.I mean... I certainly hear you but as a medical student there are a LOT of problems that are extremely generic that do come from excess weight. The problem is that especially with females and especially in regards to reproductive organs the issues that arise are very generic.  Imagine it this way.  A patient comes in with symptoms of a STD.  You test for gonorrhea and its positive.  They get upset because they say Every doctor always blames my gonorrhea I think I have a different rare STD that is causing the same symptoms. And like... maybe that is true.  On the other hand we know that the patient has gonorrhea and we know that that causes the problems described and we know that that needs to be treated.   If the problems persist after we cure that we will look further. I think part of the issue comes from people not really understanding that a lot of doctors diagnosis and treatments are guesswork.  As a doctor you do your best but even lab tests arent nearly as accurate as lay people think.  As a doctor you are trying to cure patients problems and obesity is a HUGE problem for your body. Also to be fair the OP had PCOS poly cystic ovarian syndrome because of her obesity.  Her issue now is that one of the cysts apparently got twisted.  That  was a problem because she was obese.  gtgt I have been rightfully called out about my attitude towards doctors here and I apologise.
