40466,0,t1_ceic8tn,Glad to hear youve found a place you like. Again even in Red Bank Id suggest driving by the place a few times at different times of day before you agree to sign anything. Red Bank is especially known for places that look nice but are in terrible parts of the city.Something you should know in the event you find yourself in another situation where a landlord is refusing to maintain the property  leasing laws in Tennessee heavily favor the tenant. Moreover these same laws as well as the responsibilities of both parties which should be detailed in the lease can help you in the case that your landlord is ignoring critical maintenance. A fridge that constantly smells of feces could certainly fall under critical maintenance as well as properly sealed windows and structurallyunsound ceilings and floors.This code PDF should give you some idea of the rights and responsibilities of both parties. If youre planning to continue renting for some time Id familiarize yourself with it at a basic level  especially if youre renting from a landlord that only does a few properties as theyre less likely to be familiar with it as well and instead try to rely solely on their lease. Either way once again Im glad to hear youre not going to be renting near Willow St. You can never place enough value on a safe place to live.,Chattanooga,cej1dlj,1,t5_2qnd8

373737,0,t3_1ycu2u,I dont know why so many arent upset with this. It is not being done to promote road safety but to collect money at the expense of the unlucky group who pass by this device. There is a reason that traffic typically moves faster than the posted speed limits and it actually isnt impatience. Faster speed limits have shown not to lead to an increase in accidents however traffic light cameras have shown an increase in accidents. When people who realize they are about to come across these speed traps start to slow down as compared to the rate of traffic accidents will be more likely than in normal traffic. The accidents could of course be typically minor but would still cause higher insurance rates placing more monetary burden on the people involved. Overall I think that this will hurt Chattanoogans.,Chattanooga,cfji42u,23,t5_2qnd8
