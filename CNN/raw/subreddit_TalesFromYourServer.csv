You have no reason to feel guilty for not covering for the other person  you have your life too. I say that a company that has a policy that is so stringent that theyll fire people for calling in for one shift especially if they have no prior history of callouts  has management issues.It should be up to management to handle staffing and find replacements when employees cannot make scheduled shifts its the managers job  it should never be on an employee to have to call coworkers to find someone to cover their shift.

She kept stealing glances at us so Im pretty sure she knew she was being watched. Finally after what seemed like a bazillion years of her talking on the phone she got up.As she prepared to exit the dining room and enter the gift shop portion of the store my manager asked how her meal and service was. She said it was fine and made a beeline towards the restroom. I happened to look her way and she gave me like the nastiest glare ever. If looks could kill! After she went into the restroom my manager and I moved so we could see better when she came back out. She was in there for two or three minutes. My manager told me I should go check on her.No way! You go check on her.Shes been in there forever. Shes probably hanging herself in there by now.We both kind of giggled at that then as soon as the words left my managers mouth the lady came back out and made straight for the front door. My manager followed and said she needed to pay her bill and that she also needed to pay for the birdhouse which she got from the gift shop she had been carrying. The woman begrudgingly paid and said she was from out of town she never walked out didnt recognize anyone there so how did they know her blah blah blah.

But theres nothing wrong with it.Think about it this way when you come to my restaurant my business who do you talk to? Do you have a conversation with the General Manager who is in charge of the entire place or the Executive Chef who has painstakingly created the dish in front of you or do you talk to the owner who does very little in most cases? No you talk to me and me only. I am your first and last line to the goingons of this business.But lets take it to the more important level. What do you do when you go out to eat? You sit. Thats all you have to do at least at my tables. You just have to sit there and Ill take care of everything else. The only thing I cannot do for you is the physical act of eating and using the bathroom. That is worth  of your tab every time. And theres more to it.  I will engage with you if you want me to.  I will be seen but not heard if you want me to.  But I wont ask you which of these approaches you want Ill just figure it out and do it.All you have to do is sit there and eat.Look I have made a great life for myself and my family. We can afford to go out to eat often.  But we dont because Im usually at work at those times. We dont get out much so when we do it needs to be special.Thats my job.  When you come to my place no matter what you order youre gonna have a good time.  Im gonna fucking dote on you. Im gonna do it because I want you to come back. Im gonna do it because I want you to tell your friends how great a time you had at my place. Im gonna do it because I want you to have a nice time out because chances are you dont really get out that much.

2747407,0,t1_cngd3ql,Not exactly. Im saying you should tip proportionate to your food because of the space and supplies the server uses as well as other duties the server performs for you and others to have that experience. If you dont want to support a dining facility or the workers there in other words contributing to the average produced by other customers hire a private chef or eat at home. Im speaking specifically to the example of a  hamburger and a  steak being served in the same restaurant. In that case dont eat the expensive options at places that serve much cheaper entree options. The range of food prices should give you an idea of how much more or less of the bills youre paying for that restaurant to operate. It would be ridiculous to measure the amount of water your party consumed how much light lit your table for the duration of your stay the number of sheets of toilet paper you used etc. to bill you for exactly what you used. Its a public facility. Like it or not you contribute to restaurant costs along with other guests and food prices are reflective of upcharges to maintain the facility for everyone.I was explaining why tipouts are based on sales because the server still has to pay it whether or not you pay them. If you order a  steak and under tip them they are still responsible for paying a percentage of sales to other employees because the system dictates that costs are covered by food price. Shit system.,TalesFromYourServer,cngda8f,1,t5_2v480

In Pennsylvania when I served it was about .hour.   My ENTIRE paycheck went to taxed on my reported tipped earnings. If I saw a paycheck it was less than  total. So servers literally only bring home their tips in most cases.IF a server makes LESS than your states minimum wage in PA this was .hour then your employer has to pay you whatever difference there is.

3556975,0,t3_30zwcd,From my experience servingbartending in PA.I found out why I owe taxes every year. Could be the same way people are owing taxes. From your paycheck taxes are deducted on a priority basis. I forget the order but youll get the idea FederalMedicalSocial SecurityState. Now each one takes a percent based on your total wage includes your hourly and claim tips. Now lets make it simple.Lets say you made  in tips claimed and you get  on your paycheck for your hourly wages before taxes are taken out.These percentages are not real they are to make the math simpler.Lets say Federal takes out  thats . You are left with . MedicalSocial combined takes out . thats .. You are left with .. State wants to take  but you only have . left. They take out the . and you are left with  on the paycheck. But you still owe state that . which will show up in your taxes.So it prioritizes which taxes will be deducted first.

Some people are just like that and want to be unsatisfied no matter what you do. They also dont plan on tipping you. Studies show that the tip you get is usually decided before the meal even begins because people tip the same all the time and the service barely even counts. That doesnt mean that you cannot effect if a few dollars either way Im just saying this person likely was planning on not tipping well when they sat down. You exceeded expectations with a super fast turnover time and they tipped you poorly anyway because thats what they were planning to do in the first place. If anything I would take the fact that she said the service was bad as a compliment. If the service was actually bad she wouldnt have had to point it out you would have known.

3629902,0,t1_cq60h6j,Its farfetched for several reasons.  Even if the boss got the credit card details in real time he had no way of knowing what the charges were for level III line item detail reporting is almost unheard of at restaurants.  Even if he did companies cannot ban employees from drinking off the job so all they had to do was pay for their own alcohol.  When an employee is fired there is a process to go through meet them hear their side of the story etc. and it cant be done over the phone when the employee is out of town.  Finally OPs final claim about them being forced to pay for their own hotel and their own way back home is also absurd and would provide the basis of a nice lawsuit against the company if it actually happened.

A tube of Artists Bright red oil paint. It must be oil based paint so it is permanent and not water based. So you can catch her red handed. Now use the video camera on your phone to show the serial number on the bill and that you are marking it with the red paint.Take a generous dab and put it on the face of the bill. Fold the bill in half and carefully smear it around so you have a nice thick coat of it on most of the bill. But stay away from the edges so it isnt visible. Keep the bill folded in half the paint will keep it stuck and folded. Set it where she will fall for the bait. When you see her running to wash her hands film her. Youve got her red handed. She will most likely try to toss the bill away. Grab the bill it has her bright red fingerprints on it. Now show it to your manager with the videos.

4041249,0,t3_36do8y,I had a guy come in with  of his friends and when I greeted the table with How are you today? He said worst day of my life. with a smile on his face. I chuckled because since he was smiling I thought it was a joke and he then replied Im serious. I apologized  politely although a little skeptical since everyone seemed to be smiling and then said it sounds like you need a drink! I took the tables drink orders and when I get to him he says I know you think I am a really manly and handsome guy and cant keep your eyes off of me... Mind you I am a  year old female and manage to keep a polite smile on though I wanted to do nothing more than laugh or roll my eyes. He finished with I want a chocolate martini. I get it was supposed to be a self deprecating joke but he could have done it in a less creepy way. Anyway I give my obligatory chuckle and go to get his cocktail. It takes a bit and our bartender put on a bit of a show for him to make the drink to help cheer the guy up and he seemed to be happy. He got another cocktail and everyone orders food while things go smoothly.Meanwhile when I go to check in on the table after they got their food the guy says I have all this cash and I dont know what to do with it! while he waves his money in my face. I said something along the lines like maybe deposit it in a bank. Thats what I do. I could tell he just wanted to show off in front of his friends and maybe me too.Also at the beginning of the meal the table told me to split the checks which of course is not a problem. So when I bring the bill over the guy insists with his friends that he has to pay the bill because of all his cash he has. The friends ask if he is really sure clearly fine with paying their own bill and I have already separated the checks. He insists so I go back and the check comes to around .They leave. Thank the bartender for the drinks and seem fine. When I pick up my check he left me  and stayed through the large part of dinner rush.

However whenever you serve in the cocktail the hostesses do not seat guests and the bussers do not bus your tables. I also need to note that our tipout was automatically added to our check outs on the POS.Once I was senior enough to take cocktail I realized that I still had to tip out the hostesses and bussers. Their reasoning? Oh we uh havent figured out how to change that on the POS. I had worked with that POS for years and years at a previous restaurantand I knew damn well how to change it and I knew they did too. It was a shitty reason.

They loved the money they made but they were happy to just make a cool  in the back section and not see their life flash before their eyes.Drinks were around  apps around  and mains around . Not super high end but certainly not cheap.But what made this section incomparable to others was that it was the heart of the restaurant. It was the section that filled up at pm and where you needed to kick people out at ham min after last call wed cut the front waiter around h am and let the  bartenders take over after that. We would only sit s or s or maybe the occasional  while other sections in the restaurant would receive groups.A group of  will never order nearly as much as the same amount of people spread in twos and fours.It was a seat section.

If you want an example keep reading else skip to the next paragraph. One particularly busy Friday I was two sinks full and almost out of silverware. Right as it came out someone on register came and notified me I pulled it out passed the drying towel and said all yours and returned to my two sinks full of dishes... to a snark Thats yo job!

Or when you tell them it will take longer to ensure there is no crosscontamination they say Oh Im not actually allergic I just dont like it.Although I personally treat all allergy requests the same I can understand the frustration. So many people say they are allergic to something that they actually just dont like and they dont understands how much extra time goes into an allergy dish. Also I do take a great amount of satisfaction when someone needs glutenfree due to celiac and I tell them we have GF onion rings fish and chips and a GF fryer for limited crosscontamination.

6295033,0,t1_cz4zvwo,I served for many years and still work in the industry both FOH and BOH. When I go out to dinner which isnt very frequently due to income I almost always tip . Now thats just me but Ive been in enough situations that I had zero control over while serving that I know when my server is doing hisher best to give good service. I realize that sometimes its nearly impossible to give good service. Like when management thought thanksgiving would be dead because the previous year was dead and only scheduled one server and one chef. When the all  tables filled up within  minutes and everyone orders at once...guests are going to have a bad time because one person cant handle all of that. My point is you never really know what the situation is behind the scenes. Maybe your server was put on a triple and hasnt had a chance to eat today maybe a chef called in due to hangover or maybe the schedule was made hastily and conservatively in order to save the restaurant money on labor efficiency. None of this means you should treat someone like a slave your server is not in control of everything that goes on in the restaurant. When you go out to eat you should expect to pay full price. You might have to wait a little longer for your food than you expected.If you modified something on the menu it may not taste as great as the chef intended with the ingredients youve added or subtracted to it.  Treat your server like you would treat any other person like you would want to be treated. They are after all human.EDIT I hope your triple shift went well cheers.,TalesFromYourServer,cz569tp,2,t5_2v480

A Chef that flips out over a mod without his prior approval but wont give a server his attention when they try to approach him about his approval on something is the one creating the breakdown in protocol.

First I watched as he walked directly into the ice machine and fell over and I had to light the ranges for him because he didnt feel steady enough yet. What the absolute fuck. I know that stuff like this happens in restaurants but this one has in general been a pretty standup professionally run outfit.  This shit was not professional. Halfway through service he staggers into the server station and informs me that the GM says I shouldnt seat anyone else.  This sounds kind of weird because were actually pretty busy. I say Id like to check with the GM and he threatens to hit me.  Later of course he also choked me with a scarf and told me he loved me so things were kind of crazy all around. Yeah.

We could discuss whether minimum wage is an appropriate thing but its a different discussion entirely.  Most folks working in minimum wage jobs are not there as a career but as a stepping stone to other things or as a keeping busy job for retirees.Dont get me wrong I pay my employees hr to start myself for wok that in this area is usually paid at hr or so minimum wage in Seattle is moving to hr over the next couple years.  I also give regular CoL increases as well which I keep completely separate from any wage hikes for performance.  Thats what I do but there is absolutely a place for minimum wage as well.More importantly what you are arguing for is very much an uphill battle against extremely entrenched interests.  Enforcement of existing law on the other hand is a different animal altogether. That we could begin immediately rather than fighting a protracted battle.  But we can only do so if folks would wake up to the reality that fighting the larger battle while leaving the easily handled things undone only undermines our position.Think of it this way in a combat situation do you ignore the  or  infantrymen who are slowly working their way towards a tank just because the enemy also has a tank?

7154446,0,t1_d1qju1y,The supposed to part has been studied for a while now. The McDonalization of Society is a specific piece written on this issue. Fast food and other related jobs have boiled their work tasks in to four key areas. Those areas are efficiency calculability predictability and control. You can look at these concepts from two perspectives. One on the one hand you have the customers perspective and other the workers. I will only address the workers relationship.The fast food industry and other related jobs have reworked their laborers tasks in every way to minimize the amount of time it takes to do them. Workers are also rated in many instances based on how fast they can complete a given task. In this way the more a server does the more bang for the buck both the management and customer get. These tasks however are highly repetitive based on a routine and extremely predictable. This is also where personal fulfillment is lost. Not saying that there isnt any to be had but it is very low. Lastly everyone is the same in every way. Its very standardized.You do get expose to a skill though. This is true. You get first hand experience to customer service technologies that shadow other related fields the communication skills between management and other employees and the experience to follow a task through completion. I agree that most of this is learned in the first couple of weeks with mastery to various degrees within the next few months. This is where you can take that knowledge and apply for a new job!Yes I would be happy to have everyone who is serving me and makes min wage or tipped to be in high school or upwards of  for the rest of my life. I have no issues with providing these folks the skills they need to succeed to get a better more fulfilling job.Lastly people take these jobs for a variety of reasons. You sacrifice fulfillment because you need money. We all do that on some level and the price they are offering at the time is legit. Plus in many cases having a job increases your chances of getting a better job. You have to climb the ladder.Everyone is a manager already. They just choose not to be. You are in control of you own life at every turn on every path and every decision. Just take the reins. It is frightening at first but worth it. Be a closer.,TalesFromYourServer,d1re1hh,-1,t5_2v480

I dont know what things are like in the USA but here Australia I used to work in a place that had sandwiches made fresh every day. If there were left over sandwiches we would try and donate them but were forbidden because a Management was worried that it would provide an incentive for staff to produce more than was needed so that their friends couldcome and pick them up b At what point is the line drawn? That bottle of wine has been open for a week now can we give it away as well? c If someone got food poisoning from the donated food then the business is legally liable. d  It detracts from the perceived value a customer gets from a product i.e. I paid good money for this but its not good enough for them to sell later so why have I paid so much for it?e You throw things out at the end of a Saturday night. What sort of people are you going to attract at the end of a Saturday night when you are trying to closeup so you can go home? There were just the issues that I had to address with the company that I used to work for when I tried donating food to the needy. Lets say that you get this app up and running and a restaurant uses this app to attract some new customers.  people come in eat the free food and like you say  in  buys a coffee. Are those two coffees going to provide enough revenue for the business to cover the costs of keeping the staff on or the lights on? Probably not. Its a great way to piss off your staff however they no longer potentially get free food and now they have to stay back at the end of the shift for an amount of money that probably will not be worth their while.,TalesFromYourServer,d28lwlu,2,t5_2v480

I just put up with it. I do these things because I make bank at this job. However when the restaurant ran an incredibly sexist ad I confronted the owner about it. We had a great conversation he took the ad down and weve had no further issues. If hed left the ad up? I would have quit. For me my arm hair and the need to defend myself arent a big deal. The implication that our owner is selling us to the public was a big deal. If you cant live with whats happening leave. If you can take steps to protect yourself that you feel are reasonable.

I LOVE globe artichokes and couldnt wait. Unfortunately it was full of Jerusalem artichoke which I hate. So I picked those bits out amp ate the rest. I see this as entirely my fault for assuming it was one type of artichoke not another so I wasnt complaining or asking for a different dish but afterwards I quietly mentioned it might help to specify Jerusalem artichoke on the menu just so people are aware.

It will stay there for you to collect at the end of the meal as your tip. If you provide excellent service I will add to that amount. If your service is subpar I will remove money from the pile. How much you get tipped is up to you. How does that sound?   The waiter was amused and played along. He did take over  minutes to come back with a refill on water and lost .

Called her aside at the end to thank her up and down for dealing with the madness that was my table. Got a hug and even a few tears from her and her manager since they mentioned the table she had before us were pretty much total dicks to her.

Some tip for a typical togo order or may leave a dollar or  and a bunch of trash and yes some ask for water and you have to do work after they leave and they can cost you money from tipping customers.What you have to remember is as long as you work in a restaurant you will always have bad tippers or non tippers but therere are the good to beyond great tippers who make up for these people.A customer is a customer whether we like them or not. Most companies or managers main concern is not about us making our tips but for the sales and expense costs.They pay us an hourly even though we rely on our tips we still have to help and serve people who never or barely tip. It sucks but thats the business.If it was busy and you needed the table for a  top that person should be asked to move to a smaller table but there is no law that says theyre doing anything illegal.Are you an asshole?

I usually treat things that multiple customers use as contaminated in general though cause customers can be soooo gross sometimes.,TalesFromYourServer,dfw6stl,2,t5_2v480

Same with spaghetti everyone does it a little different.

11575082,0,t3_6577ua,One of the few bright spots about bartending at a country club some years back was one particular guest.  To give some background I was located in a midsized city with a big college basketball following.  He would occasionally show up to eat dinner dressed to the nines and would treat every staff member that he came across like his own grandchildren. On one particular night he and his wife came in about  minutes before close as Im starting to clean up.  Recognizing him immediately I wanted to make sure he had a great time and didnt feel bad for being the last ones in the place.  He is famous for shaking hands with whichever serverbartender took care of him and EVERY SINGLE TIME there was at least a  bill and often times more in that handshake and what I loved most about this was that he never made a show of it to the rest of the patrons  he was quiet and sneaky with his tips. He was the president of a local bank and it got so ridiculous that we all joked he must have someone on payroll whose sole job it was to fold up big bills for him to hand out anytime he went out to dinner. I was more than happy to have he and his wife I didnt care what time it was.  And the stars aligned for me that night because the local college bball team was in a deep NCAA tournament run and the game went to overtime.  I sure as Hell wasnt going to kick them out and despite his protests I reassured him that it was completely fine that they camped after hours to watch the game.  After all I wasnt leaving until it was over anyway!  I made that loud and clear and kept refusing his handshake bonuses but he persisted.I left that night having watched my local team advance to the next round with over  in cash from him alone for doing nothing more than serving a couple dishes and drinks and watching the game right beside him when he told me to come sit and join them.I dont know if hes still in that area but if I ever hear the sad news of this older gentlemans passing I will do everything I can to go to the funeral.  Ive never met such a gracious and humble patron who very easily could have been the complete opposite and I doubt I ever will. ,TalesFromYourServer,dg81ibs,15,t5_2v480

11747686,0,t3_67hd5l,When I switched careers and started serving it was an interesting change. However there were usually goalscontests the managers ran so it was easy to know how I was doing. Once I was hitting the goals set I pulled a manager aside and expressed interest in more responsibilities and better sections and just asked if there are additional things I can do to get to that point. In just a few shifts I was given one of the best sections in the entire restaurant as a test and I did very well. I moved up quickly due to my performance as well as the high turnover. Within my first six months of serving I moved up to the top five servers out of . I ended up staying there nearly three years before moving on to a local resort. Short version  stay positive know what the managers are looking for and do it and exceed when possible dont be pushy be a team player. I dont think I would start questioning the managers about their sections being so new. That might put you in the dog house. Instead of saying things about what they might be doing wrong always try to talk about your performance and how you can earn those prized sections. The servers in those sections likely started in a similar manner. We all started on the bottom at some point. For what its worth I live on Maui and the bad sections dont have any waterfront tables or booths they are those shitty tables in the middle that NO ONE wants to sit at. Hosts sometimes had to try over ten times in a row before someone finally didnt try to move and that was when I was lucky enough to have hosts that actually followed the rotation and kept trying to sit me until someone stayed. Most hosts wouldnt even try to sit that table more than once before moving on and giving up. ,TalesFromYourServer,dgrmodh,3,t5_2v480
