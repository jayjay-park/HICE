4295797,0,t3_3a2nft,on first glance i would say you have way too many diners and water treatment plants. I like keeping the middle indicator of resources around the middle  first third of the bar. Also consider upgrading a room instead of just making more rooms. It may be cheaper and use less electricity if thats an issue.I would also staff each room to its max before considering making more rooms. The more people in a room the faster youll get your resourcestldr I would probably start over and not expand as much as you have. Focus on a few key rooms staff them full and upgrade to save on electricity,foshelter,cs9uxiy,1,t5_38ooo

4306200,0,t3_3a0p7v,One way to manage the random fires and radroaches i.e. the ones not caused by rushing is to make sure typically unpopulated rooms storage rooms barracks have populated rooms vertically and horizontally. From what Ive experienced as long as there is a dweller in the room when an incident occurs it wont spread to adjacent rooms unless the dweller is pregnant then it will spread as the dweller flees the room. This way when an incident occurs in an unpopulated room it will only spread into the adjacent populated rooms but no further. This prevents it spreading multiple times through unpopulated rooms and allows for ample time to assign dwellers to deal with the situation.,foshelter,csb18nk,3,t5_38ooo

Conversely if a fire breaks out  people can extinguish it rather easily without taking much damage. The incident rate usually caps out around something percent.

I dont have any problems with raiders and deathclaws might kill a couple of my dwellers if Im not vigilant with stimpacks. How well optimised is your base layout? I dont have to micromanage that much because I put most of my powerful guys in the first two rooms. Usually deathclaws wont get much further than that. Speaking of deathclaws I think the lore reason for them attacking your vault is due to the radii broadcasts and opening and closing of your vault doors. They might be able to detecthear these things and sense a lot of juicy food in a giant fridge basically.A lot of these problems sound like you want them to make a game that is just a resource collector. Whats the point in sending out explorers and upgrading your special stats to find better items if there isnt anything to compete with you?

I have  such labs thats  stimpacks.But it gets better. If your  int luck dweller wears clothing that boosts int or luck or a combo of the  you will get  knocked off the  chance you would have to fail on the second rush.  Dweller in  int robes or lucky suit  lck would get first rush at  fail rate second is Wearing the advanced lab coat  int or the proffessor robes or librarian outfit  int  lck both the FIRST AND SECOND RUSH WILL BE  CHANCE TO FAILso with just  piece of relatively common gear you can get  stimpacks from each med bay with  risk med bays? Thats NINETY SIX STIMPACKS WITHIN A COUPLE MINUTES FROM ONE DWELLER!And if you get the  int lab coat or lucky suit the third rush will only have a  fail rate. I dont know how many stimpacks you could possibly want but that should do a hell of a lot to fill up your storage.And the best bit is you dont even need to keep him or worse a whole group in there.

No other company has put much effort into rereleasing a previous title. When they bought the Fallout franchise Bethesda also acquired Fallout   s code. No I have no idea how theyd monetize it but Im certain current fans would love to see where it all came from. Modern handheld devices have significantly more power than what those games needed and the turnbased foundation would work perfectly.

Mainly two reasons i Other source of damage depleting HP quicker and ii they dont take radaway until accumulated rads have reached a certain point until which time your max HP is lesser than it would be otherwise and that indirectly means using stimpacks quicker because you only heal up to the rad induced HP cap.That said anything with at least E will do as long as exploreres have E.

For wasteland exploration though having max SPECIAL dwellers is incredibly useful. Every SPECIAL stat does something in the wastes and having them all at  majorly increases an explorers effectiveness. In terms of which stats are the best for the wasteland endurance is a must as it gives dwellers more health when they level up and it gives radiation resistance in the wasteland wasteland radiation immunity occurs at  endurance. Luck is also very important for more caps and I think it increases your odds at better loot though I honestly dont know as Ive seen conflicting reports and no hard evidence.

6668230,0,t3_46w6o8,As already mentioned check your power production versus power consumption in your stats page. Assuming you have more production than consumption you either dont have enough excess to allow for raidersroaches or you dont have enough storage. Also the production listed is only if you click on your power rooms the second they finish so actual production is lower. As a general rule you want the vertical bar on each of your resource bars in the middle or further left. This means your storage is at least twice your consumption. Buildupgrade more of the relevant production room to increase storage even if you dont put any dwellers in the room. You can then increase production by putting dwellers in those new rooms. The excess storage allows for the fact your consumption is constant while your production is only sporadic when a room finishes. The excess also gives you a buffer against raiderroach loss. ,foshelter,d091wka,2,t5_38ooo

7214083,0,t1_d1y5e3a,There are several different layouts you can go with mostly depending on how much health your dwellers have. Besides the actual layout of the rooms some folks will recommend you avoid deep rooms like the Nuclear Reactor or the Water Purification where dwellers can run behind stuff or far back in the room. Shallow rooms like the Nukacola Plant are popular production rooms which double as guard rooms.If your dwellers have very good health and good weapons you can create a deadend on the first floor by going door | Elevator | wide | wide. The deathclaws would have to backtrack through the wide a second time to reach the single elevator down. Only recommended if your dwellers can handle  passes from deathclaws without needing healing to live.At the other end of spectrum if your dwellers would have trouble surviving just one pass you can split the first floor into a bunch of wide rooms with an elevator on the far right. The wides will make tapping the dwellers to select and heal them easier.In the middle you can do a layout similar to the first mentioned but with an elevator on the far right so the deathclaws dont have to backtrack to go down. Your dwellers on the first and second floor are tough enough to handle a single pass without needing healing giving you time to heal them after the incident is over.,foshelter,d1y6old,2,t5_38ooo

8065673,0,t1_d4mi11k,You can have the same benefit by leaving the first elevator there.  Theres enough room for the vault entrance one elevator five room blocks and then one more elevator at the far right side.  You dont gain enough room for anything but another elevator by removing the first one so theres really no benefit to it.If your goal is to funnel intruders through to the right side then you can either a Not connect the elevator near the entrance to the second floor or b Notice that all intruders will follow the same rules for pathing through the vault which will send them across the first floor and then down any elevator they find at the right side even if that means ignoring the first elevator they see.My usual pattern includes two elevator shafts one right next to the entrance and one at the far right.  By breaking them up and being careful about how the two sides connect I force all raiders and deathclaws to run through the whole first floor down to the second floor on the right side where they hit a dead end and go back up to the first floor to run through the two most heavily guarded rooms in the vault a second time.Almost nothing ever makes it back to the first elevator.,foshelter,d4mnp41,2,t5_38ooo

8255543,0,t1_d59e5l4,Unfortunately that is not how internal incidents fire molerats radroaches work. The difficultly will alter based on size and level of each room. As an example you can easily see this when a bunch of level  dwellers in a Level  training room easily deal with an incident which spread from an adjacent Level  Medbay. In such cases where an empty upgraded room is touching occupied Level  rooms dont rush low level dwellers into the upgraded room to fight the incident or they will die. Instead let it spread to the adjacent Level  rooms where it will be easily dealth with.It is external incidents raiders and deathclaws which will stay the same difficulty regardless of which room they move to. This is because the difficulty for external incidents is based on average dweller level not counting explorers.,foshelter,d59hzod,2,t5_38ooo

Radscorpions and ghouls cause radiation damage even to E dwellers even got radiation damage albeit very little on dwellers wearing Sheriffs Duster which has E P. All in all though LA is probably the way to go. Or strictly A or L for that matter A will give you a higher fire rate which means more crits L is just more crits so perhaps A is better?.Edit So running a quest right now and my Dwellers are as follows.Todd  S P E C I A L Drag Racer Outfit  to S E A L and a Plasma Rifle Russell   to all stats  Drag Racer Outfit  to S E A L and a Plasma Rifle Lori   to all stats  Soda Fountain Dress  to P E I L and a plasma Rifle No combat affecting petsThey enter a room with  raiders in a same room they usually share the same HP values unless one is a boss or has a skull under its healthbar.

This could be exceptionally bizarrely bad RNG but even assuming that in the unlikely case that the next  births each produce twins I would still be looking at a statistic closer to  chance of twins rather than . Obviously the more births I do the more data Ill have but so far its not lookin good.In an above comment and the edited post I cite my reasons for equipping the pet during conception.Edit I have also delivered several more than  babies with the pet equipped during birth and it yielded  twins. I didnt report this info in the original post because a I believed that equipping the pet during birth was incorrect and therefore not useful to the numbers and b the sample size was too small to really be statistically significant in any way. I can easily swallow the likelihood of four or so things in a row happening to fall on the  chance side of things.

You are better off evicting most of your population and tearing everything down that actually starting a new vault in a different slot. Dont do it. Burn everything down before you do that.One other thing to keep in mind it is almost unavoidable that you will have to train up a few different generations.

10206877,0,t3_5lxrld,I trained  dwellers to Max Stats at Level  and leveled each one with E outfit. While they were leveling in the Wasteland they found plenty of recipes and legendary junk. Eventually I got the E outfit recipe. Also E leveled dwellers are good for all quests which means more recipes and more legendary junk.I dont think its a good idea to focus on getting the E outfit right away. There are  main problems with this idea.. To mass produce E outfits you need legendary junk which is hard to get without good wasteland dwellers Max Stats. Crafting many E outfits takes a lot of time even with  E dwellers   E outfitsTherefore I think its a good idea to have lots of Max Stat dwellers before starting to produce perfect max health dwellers. Max Stat dwellers can be used for everything.. They boost resource production and crafting dramatically. . They find lots of caps in the wasteland and all quests can be done with them.. They can be used to breed rare and legendary dwellers which reduces training times.I produced  Max Stat dwellers to fill all  training rooms. When they were all finished I could already evict all Non Max Stat dwellers because of the production boost. Now I have  perfect dwellers in the pipeline and Im slowly producing E outfits. To get a new vault to  perfect dwellers its probably going to take  months depending largely on how much you play each day.Be sure to name your dwellers to remember who it perfect and who is not.

Once youve done that rewind time on your device to back around Christmas and see if they show up.

Sure itll protect you from the first radscorpion attack but itll take you a long time to earn that power reserve back. I dont exit to the menu or whatever else even on my survival vault because I make sure to have enough production to earn back my losses before theyre likely to occur again. If you mess that up you better have enough production to get back up and running quickly.My maxed vault runs on six fully staffed nuke plants all at max level all dwellers at S or greater. My survival vault is significantly smaller half the dwellers and a third of the rooms but still runs on four fully staffed lowest level nuke plants still S or more.
