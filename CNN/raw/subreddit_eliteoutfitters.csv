4398484,0,t1_cslft76,Depends completely on the type of ship youre flying but vs an equal ship or bigger it works fine. Struggles vs cobras and vipers because of their small size,eliteoutfitters,cslfzi7,1,t5_37am0
4399950,0,t3_3b89cp,Heres my build. Having a lot of fun in RES areas. Also has a nice jump range of about .ly unladen.edit range,eliteoutfitters,csllxge,1,t5_37am0
4659525,0,t3_3eqwbj,HowdyCheck this guy out. This is sub  million according to Coriolis. Gets you two SCB that you can run in tandem a bunch of cargo space that you can swap out for two more SCBs to run in tandem and Rating A Thrusters for the best manoeuvrability.,eliteoutfitters,cthw237,2,t5_37am0
6381389,0,t3_42z4wg,Go shieldless or go home boy!You want to run from everything and avoid scans so keep that temperature deploy hardpoints only as a last resort to maybe stop a scan but dont fight. Run away and boost through that mail slot shieldless like the real pilot you are. If you prefer ditch some cargo slots for more hull reinforcement but none one is ever going to catch you.,eliteoutfitters,czezuk2,2,t5_37am0
6425333,0,t1_czj130i,Check out the ship I posted It has the same jump range but better cargo and better top speed for escaping scans and is only  mill if you get the discount.,eliteoutfitters,czjx050,1,t5_37am0
6580627,0,t3_45qc1u,This is the DBS that I bounty hunted and undermined with for a while. I would put an A FSD in when changing systems but put in a D while hunting to keep weight down. Weapons you can be pretty flexible with since the ship is so maneuverable. ,eliteoutfitters,czzzo5h,2,t5_37am0
6594159,0,t1_d01czif,Thanks for the detailed reply!  Ill have to log in later tonight and test these puppies out but the courier build looks almost perfect with your recommendations.The A fuel scoop for the Asp looks a little expensive at the moment but nothing a few more Robigo runs wont fix.,eliteoutfitters,d01e22z,1,t5_37am0
7065454,0,t3_4cdl1t,Cannon is not bad its just PA is that good ,eliteoutfitters,d1h8c6w,1,t5_37am0
7134209,0,t3_4d9oiw,It will be a PITA to hit small ships like eagles and couriers with plasmas so you will want something gimballed for dealing with them.  multicannons can be fun  I have that setup on my FDL.,eliteoutfitters,d1p2x2s,1,t5_37am0
7893426,0,t3_4lwauz,If you are flying a large ship you need turrets. Even a Corvette with its relatively good pitch rate needs some turrets in the small and medium hardpoints to help with killing smaller ships.,eliteoutfitters,d43ami8,1,t5_37am0
8326233,0,t1_d5i2rbn,Only Jameson and that other station whose name escapes me at the moment with the  markup.,eliteoutfitters,d5ic189,1,t5_37am0
10356579,0,t1_dchyci2,Ive heard the a Biweave is good on a vulture. In general you dont want a vultures shields to drop so a biweave would let them drop more often but me much faster to recharge and then rejoin the fight.Im not sure about module reinforcement. It just got added so Ive never used it but it seems that it would help if you lose shields and are trying to escape. It would lower the maneuverability though by increasing mass.,eliteoutfitters,dchz8l6,2,t5_37am0
10894882,0,t3_5vnjsq,Never really tried messing with a vulture but if I were Id try something like this If you dont want to go the reactive armor w thermal resist HRP package as a whole you need to go with military or lightweight  heavy duty mods otherwise your resistances will be wonky. I chose cannons because of powerPD requirements being low. If you want that extra military slot to be a shield cell bank youll need to figure out something powerwise. Whether it being overcharge g for the pp or sacrificing power elsewhere such as  less booster an OC G probably isnt enough. If you dont run an SCB in that slot you probably could swap out the heatsink for another chaff.,eliteoutfitters,de3qa4m,1,t5_37am0
10959327,0,t1_de8xqgu,For PvE this would certainly work but for PvP you generally need to use fixed weapons to be able to square off against your regular pvpers. Smaller ships will have endless chaffs or even silent running and the big  in combat will usually be staying steady on you with fixed weapons of their own or something like my PvP vette that can reduce the effectiveness of SCBs and do powerful strafing runs with frag cannons and rip through shields and hull with the PAs. If youre looking to stay a PvE build it looks mostly alright except to add some A SCBs and another set of heat sinks. You wont need armor for PvE as with biweaves youll just low wake out whenever you run out of SCBs. With regards to weapons big ships will take reduced damage from small and medium kinetic weapons but many are known to use huge beam lasers not burst with efficient mod. But dont get phasing sequence youll notice that significantly reduces your damage output and the mod in general is pointless since the point of lasers is to rip through shields. Let the huge beams wreck enemy shields then tear through their hull with the MCsFor PvP theres so many different possibilities you could go. You could still use gimballed weapons in the rare case your opponent doesnt have chaffs or if youre looking to grief traders and whatnot no judgement here. But if youre looking to square off against other pvpers youd be better suited doing something else with fixed weapons. But theres so many options with PvP I couldnt begin to explain the meta choices. Frag cannons are pretty nice though.,eliteoutfitters,deadks3,1,t5_37am0
11748762,0,t3_5jrenf,Okay this is the current build that youve posted. Not bad for a start lets see if I can tweak it for better performance and perhaps save you a few creds ......And here we go.Right Ive lowered your mass somewhat by changing all small components to D rated and stripped the cargo space out Explorers dont really need Cargo space TBH your main commodity is data. Ive added a second AFU reason for this is that if your ship gets damaged you can use them to repair each other plus all your damaged components youll last a lot longer out there just keep one switched off to save power until you need it set down on a landable moon and repair away use the SRV to scout for ammo. Ive also added a pair of Heat Sink Launchers in case you overheat while fuel scooping. Use them sparingly.The result is a cheaper over M build with better FSD range thats a little more repairable.If you fancy something a little more flashier then get to Engineers and try thisA bit of time and grease work can improve your build with little cost.Also use the Coriolis Build Planner to plan and display your builds its a lot easier than sitting there typing it out. Although saying that your presentation was awesome.  ,eliteoutfitters,dgrr2bq,1,t5_37am0
11754491,0,t3_67mwpm,With such a small ship you really benefit from a few extra tons in the hold.    I would consider dumping the shield generator. It would mean you could     lower your power requirements   possibly size down your power plant power distrib   which would lower weight enable faster boosting   and also reduce heat emmissions   increasing stealthiness   and contribute a large  increase in your cargo carrying capacity    You ought to try a few runs as though you had no shields first. This would give you some practice. In particular you need to be more awake when you are leaving the station as you may bump into something if not concentrating.    Have fun with your ship Commander!,eliteoutfitters,dgsegdf,2,t5_37am0
