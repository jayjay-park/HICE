11594239,0,t1_dga7gf1,For m professor hes an Asian American man who actually married an Asian woman and loves hot dogs as much as anyone else. You probably dont live in a densely populated area full of Asians I presume! I already said that my point was I am not breeding my genes because you all seem to think spreading my degenerate mess isnt helping the Asian population is my point. And yes I hold both Asian and white men accountable since they had been the main figures in my life. Accountability bro. Cant stand up for our Asian sisters who deal with misogyny from white racism youre indeed part of the problem and is why the Asian American community is divided. The mail order brides that first came to the us didnt come by choice. Yes Asian women have choice now but to deny that their experiences of white racism is all their fault solely is just pathetic. Yes I blame them for choosing those men but heres my solution people like me withdraw from the dating game all together.,LuWatch,dga7rgb,2,t5_3k003
