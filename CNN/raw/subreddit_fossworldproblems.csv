178355,0,t1_ceyqgpb,And thats exactly the viewpoint that scares me away from both Vim and Emacs the one that demands hard work from the user to dominate the tool instead of the tool accommodating to the users paradigm or at least guiding said user to a different paradigm without so much hassle. Heck having to memorize new key bindings for every single command including such things as moving the cursor isnt exactly my idea of friendly no matter how ergonomic or mnemonic said bindings are. I might try it if there was at least an onscreen guide of which commands are available on context something like Press Mx to display extra mode or Press  to display the menu with at least something akin to autocompletion on each. Nano has it for example and despite of being far more limited for such things as copypasting its still my editor of choice while in the CLI because it does show help instead of requesting the user to pass a course before even starting to type.,fossworldproblems,ceyqzi6,-7,t5_2swb1

Submitting CVs to HR staff who have no clue what theyre reading except for the certifications they know are applicable to the job will not work unless you either get an amazing HR person or the company is small enough to have the IT staff doing the recruiting directly.The other interviews I got which generally went pretty well just wasnt a good fit for me or them for one reason or another were through friends of friends acquaintances from various hobbies and a rare few companies that are so ITfocused that their HR team actually knows what it is theyre reading and thus are worth applying at.,fossworldproblems,clpuqbw,1,t5_2swb1

5374870,0,t1_cvynz2d,There is though what exactly depends on what you mean by that. If you want the difference between yaourt and cower well the latter is written in C and doesnt actually do the building part. If you want the difference between yaourt and whatever my crappy thing is... well mines a fish function and yaourt is famous for being the maximalist AUR helper  it does everything including wrapping pacman proper.I used to use cower but with the gitbased aur downloading and updating can be done via git clone and git pull which also gives you the benefits of git including a log of what has changed in the package and a way of storing local changes so the only thing I needed was searching since I didnt want to open up a browser all the time. After I got searching working I thought maybe I could also make it print the link I need to give to git clone so I did that. Then I thought maybe I could just let it do the clone. So I did that. Then I let it also clone the AUR dependencies. And then I noticed it did a fair bit of what cower does so I posted this.,fossworldproblems,cvyp89l,4,t5_2swb1

Ive been a Linux user since  but I also have to use and administer a bunch of other operating systems including Windows servers. There is an event log and it is fairly well curated. As of Windows Vista there are even some decent providerspecific event logs for specific subsystems. On top of that there are ways of enabling more verbose logging for quite a lot of software and services you might run. Third party applications are a crap shoot but thats the case with any OS.So while Windows might have lots of things that suck there have been easily accessible centralized event logs on both desktop and server versions of Windows since ServerWindows  and support for it has improved significantly since then. ,fossworldproblems,d5jwvk3,3,t5_2swb1
