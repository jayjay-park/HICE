404676,0,t1_cfmb3a0,Read your whole thread and thought Id chime in on your transport issue. If you can catch a ride to Ashley Phosphate and take the Carta bus from there the bus has a bike rack and could end up saving you some time and risk. Most people from Summerville head that way to work so even if your buddy isnt going that way maybe a neighbor or someone on the block wouldnt mind giving you a lift. I know they sell bus passes so maybe you can save a little change in the long run. Either way biking that far isnt really feasible. Its illegal on the highway and the alternate routes are going to lead you through some shady neighborhoods. ,Charleston,cfmplqu,2,t5_2qi6h

1038636,0,t3_25zejc,While Im VERY glad someone has put a stop to the Infilaw purchase the Commission on Higher Ed deserves no kudos for anything about the way theyve backed CSoL into a corner. As a condition of their state licensure they cannot even discuss being bought by public entities or they risk losing both state license and accreditation. This severely limits any avenues they can pursue as almost all of the private colleges in the state are too far away to provide any material support. An attempt to overturn this in order for them to pursue other options was tabled earlier this year. If you start digging you realize that CSoL has had the deck stacked against them from the begging due to a bunch of political influence by important UofSC alumni. All this handwringing is just a cover for these smarmy corrupt bureaucrats waiting for the only other law school in the state to fail. ,Charleston,chmcixj,5,t5_2qi6h

Richmond does have some more northern characteristics mainly being that the city just isnt as friendly.  You dont notice it as much living there but when you move away and go back people definitely lack that southern charm and that welcoming feeling.  You notice it just in every day interactions with people.

You can take a guided one  Charleston Sole Charleston Footprints  or grab a tourbook and guide yourself around.  A guided one is a great way to start and get your bearings and then you can note the places you want to come back and explore more by yourself.  Charleston has a LOT to offer we cater to tourists remember? so if you tell us a little more about what youre into we can give better ideas.  Are you more into the lowcountry environment and want to go kayaking in the salt marshes and see dolphins and alligators?  Or are you into the history and architecture and want to go tour historic homes and cobblestone streets?  A military buff who wants to tour the Yorktown and the Citadel and Fort Moultrie?

8650299,0,t1_d6mt6hk,Well you can only measure what you can measure. There was a study conducted that measured the bike lanes impact on drivers commute times during rush hour and the result of that study concluded that the impact was miniscule.You can only speculate on how many people will use it but if the Ravanel is any precedent Id say it will be used quite frequently for both commuting and recreation.However questions like how many people will use the bike lane for biking completely misses the big picture with this issue. The bike lane is not about creating a lane for cyclists its about creating a connection between two important parts of the city that doesnt exist its about controlling traffic by reducing peoples dependence on cars with an increasing population and its about making West Ashley a more attractive place to live work and play.In fact saying that a bike lane wont work is more speculative than saying it will. The facts are West Ashley is the most populated area of Charleston the engineering study proved the lane would not impede drivers commute times walkable urban neighborhoods the lane would improve walkability and Charleston is becoming more urban have much higher property value than those that are car dependent and Charlestons population is growing a such a clip that without any alternative way of getting around means a huge increase in cars on the road in a short amount of time.These are quantifiable facts. What facts does those that oppose the lane present?I mean think about it if youre concerned about people not using it its not like were building a bike lane to nowhere. Were building a bike lane that connects to a huge Greenaway in the most populated part of the city.Yeah maybe this relatively small public expense wont attract the multiplied influx of private investment I hope that it will but neither will doing nothing which is exactly what will happen if this gets killed.,Charleston,d6mwf28,2,t5_2qi6h

That doing drugs makes you someone who has less regard for all laws and in this case the implication would be that he has a lack of regard for the law of not raping people. I dont buy the idea of doing cocaine making you a rapist any more than I do that marijuana makes you a murder. . She is reporting this as a rape because of him being a jerk. Being a jerk and being a rapist are two very different things. If he is just a jerk I hope he isnt labeled as a rapist. If he is a rapist I hope he is punished to the full extent of the law.

Waiters should make a living wage without tips absolutely and living on a servers wage can be hard but for the most part being a server is a job most patient able bodied people can do.  It is not dangerous particularly stressful and minor mistakes usually lead to a best a crap tip and at worst a reprimand from a manager not loss of life serious injury allergies aside or significant financial loss.,Charleston,df49i44,1,t5_2qi6h

No need to be a dick. If you want to say maybe they have changed and are better thats great. But dont say Im a dick because I have had bad experiences there. ,Charleston,dfs97o7,6,t5_2qi6h

Thats kind of what I was expecting from the judge some avvo suggestions for a similar situation were saying to speak with the officer when I got there I didnt think the officer could do much other than drop his ticket against me but I dont see that happening.,Charleston,dfwr03u,1,t5_2qi6h

11502853,0,t1_dfzeihj,I grew up in Savannah and Im back here visiting my parents this weekend. Im shocked to hear you say the cuisine is similar. Ive yet to find any Savannah restaurants even moderately comparable to Charleston. Most of the nice restaurants here are overdressed mallfoodcourtquality mediocre fare. I do agree with everything else youve said though. And theres a complete lack of culture and events in Savannah that makes it incredibly boring after youve done a day of tours.,Charleston,dfzuk4i,11,t5_2qi6h

11544705,0,t1_dg4knpn,I currently live in that neighborhood and your description of it is pure fantasy. I walk home from Warehouse Minibar Fuel and Xiao Bao multiple nights per week. I have other friends who live twothree blocks north of Calhoun bw East Bay and Meeting on streets like John and Ann. I walk from their homes to mine frequently on the weekends and quite late too. Its a wonder I keep doing it though seeing as how I get raped and robbed every time I step out my front door.These are some of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city and the property values reflect that. Maybe urban living just isnt for you.,Charleston,dg4legt,0,t5_2qi6h

11610398,0,t3_65nn7z,It all depends on what you define as value. MP is nicest because its relatively new and there is a lot of places to spend your money. But in terms of a livable community only small sections are walkable and affording those places is possible but youll pay a pretty penny regardless. Also youll be traveling closer to  min to the airport because traffic is always there and you have to cross one of two bridges. I prefer West Ashley as there is the avondale community which definitely is smaller lots of young families in that area nice Greenway and havent met anyone who looks down their nose at you. Variety of local shops and a more down to earth vibe. MP is more superficial I think. My realtor encouraged us to look at Park circle its an up and coming spot in terms of real estate value. People are a little concerned about crime but hey if youve got any sense youll be fine. There are way worse places. Like I said it all depends on what you want. Pros and cons to every community. ,Charleston,dgc1rn3,2,t5_2qi6h

11710069,0,t3_6721o6,Not to devalue your post because I agree with most of it. Im born and bred from James Island. My hometown that I once wanted to live on forever is now impossible to live on. Apartment and home prices are insane and you add to that commute to anywhere and its not really viable. At least you and your wife are able to even look at houses. Im at a point now where I can barely afford the ever increasing cost of apartments but affording a home is impossible. I also dont want my son to go to a terrible school so what am I supposed to do? Leave my home and try to make it somewhere else?,Charleston,dgnd6pl,5,t5_2qi6h
11735823,0,t1_dgq9z4g,Honest question does the NAACP serve a real need or purpose anymore? Every time I see something about the local chapter it feels really dated and pointless. Stuff like boycotting car dealerships because of police brutality or the one the other week where a black man was accosted by some middle eastern shop owners and the NAACP spokesman said they need to go back to their own country. Is it just our local chapter that seems inept?,Charleston,dgqaa0e,5,t5_2qi6h
