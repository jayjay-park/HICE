834517,0,t3_23osgy,The weird thing is I dont fucking know. Ive been wondering that. I remember watching a couple of episodes when I was younger but  years ago I randomly started watching it. I prefer the stories of villains and antiheroes and Invader Zim seemed like it was made just for me.,invaderzim,cgz4xsa,3,t5_2smqo
2018997,0,t1_ckwa82k,Agreed. So whomever takes the initiative to do such know that I would be happy to include it on our sidebar. Id make it myself but Im already bogged down with other responsibilities.,invaderzim,ckwhho8,1,t5_2smqo
2059238,0,t1_cl0wdxa,Zims animation style makes it impossible to alter to newer formats such as HD. Believe me Ive asked animator friends and a Zim crew member.Also theres  episodes read  min programs where some consist of two  minute stories or a two part  min story. These do not include the original pilot Not to be confused with Nightmare Begins nor the unfinished season  episodes.,invaderzim,cl1kok6,2,t5_2smqo
3160743,0,t3_2w8kk9,I really dont think noticing common comparable tropes is enough to start a Rick and Morty thread.  Youre welcome to start a tropes topic about Zim though.,invaderzim,coplxxq,1,t5_2smqo
3188940,0,t3_2wlwjd,I was actually really excited because I thought hed be doing it himself freeing up room for the darker humor nickelodeon wouldnt allow. Still quite excited though.,invaderzim,cosj7u9,2,t5_2smqo

6427301,0,t3_43lio3,I wont say what it should be like but Ill tell you what Id actually spend money on.   Do you remember the old Activity Center computer games from the s that youd find if you went to a computer store and went to the kids games?  Batman The Animated Series Aladdin Land Before fuckin Time etc.What if Jhonen was allowed to insert his absurd humor into one and maybe even parody it?  ,invaderzim,czk4cqp,1,t5_2smqo
7055852,0,t1_d1g3x3d,If Zim is in Dib and Gir are pretty much in.,invaderzim,d1g51vb,1,t5_2smqo
8427834,0,t1_d5uz46h,But also actually reading through it Im finding out ALL sorts of interesting things such as ZIMs race originally being called the NOYNGS instead of the Irkens and learning things such as Ms. Bitters actually only being  but seen as much older through KidOVision.. Theres some pretty interesting things such as that all throughout this!,invaderzim,d5v0qyj,6,t5_2smqo

11621224,0,t3_65acii,I say they go totally dark.  Zim does another dumb plan except this time Dib screws up it works because humans are dumb as hell and the Earth is absolutely conquered and Zim is hailed a hero of the invaders.Itd be the perfect ending to the show really.ED  If they wanted to lighten it up Earth might actually be better off invaded in a kind of irony.  Also not out of line with the show.,invaderzim,dgd9yvb,1,t5_2smqo
