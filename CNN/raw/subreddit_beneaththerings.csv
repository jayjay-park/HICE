Far worse.Not only were there little squares in the precursors of the red blood cells other cells were infected too. The plateletprecursors the white blood cells the fat cells and even the small osteoblasts in the small amount of bone he could see  each and every one had small dark squares. They appeared benign enough as the cells appeared to be functioning normally. The precursors cells were dividing the osteoblasts appeared burrowed dormant in the bone as they normally would and the fat cells remained engorged with adipose. But it was unmistakable they were affected.Death was no stranger to Dr. Banks. It was a part of his life. He had spent many nights alone in the morgue dissected patients who had succumbed to a variety of illnesses. Typically they were elderly and suffered from multiorgan failure. Nobody had been surprised by their demise and the autopsy was a result of nextofkin insistence rather than one of necessity. Occasionally he had dissected young men and women for which their death was tragic and unexpected  some from trauma some from homicide or suicide and some of undiagnosed fatal conditions. Of the later he was able to help provide closure for both legal proceedings as well as for the families themselves. In his time training and his moonlighting in the Emergency Department he had seen previously healthy people deteriorate and die over a matter of hours. Separating emotion from his work was a part of his job but occasionally he found himself short of words and defeated when speaking with the family members of his patients. For those family members Dr. Banks was a beacon of hope that would rather than deliver news of recovery instead bring the devastating news of the loss of a loved one. Sometimes the delivery of bad news was harder than others. He had never imagined that he would be the bearer of his own bad news.He had contemplated his own mortality in the past as every doctor had. He had mused about the most probably way for him to die from time to time. Infectious disease was a possibility for he was exposed almost constantly. A few times he had gotten sick from patient exposures but these episodes were generally mild and shortlived. He didnt smoke and rarely drank so lung or liver disease seemed unlikely. He always figured he would develop heart disease from poor hospital cafeteria food and a high stress lifestyle and eventually exit stage left from a massive heart attack or arrythmia. Not surprisingly he hadnt entertained the prospect of dying alone on a distant icy moon from an unknown pathogen away from friends family and medical support.One fact made him feel uneasy he felt perfectly fine. He hadnt had a fever or required medications since immediately after the suit breach yesterday. He had continued taking antivirals because he didnt know what else to do. Obviously they werent doing much given the rapid spread of the pathogen from just his reticulocytes to other cell lineages. To hell with it. He decided that they wouldnt be much use of him and would no longer take them. Antimalarial medications seemed appropriate given the similarities but the small medical wing contained no such drugs. Alone in the medical wing Dr. Banks decided to forego medical treatment and let this unknown pathogen that now threatened his life take its natural or unnatural course. He briefly considered sending a distress call back to NASA for their advice but he knew nobody back at home had the background and qualifications that he possessed. Their guidance would be of little help and he risked turning the crew against him and further compromising the mission by confessing his condition. Perhaps his own immune system would fight it but the chances seemed dreadfully slim given that it had done nothing to contain the infection thus far. His body wasnt even mounting a fever anymore indicating that it no longer even detected the now ubiquitous foreign material. He could be dead within hours or persist for weeks. He was sown with seeds of unknown danger and now awaited the harvest.,beneaththerings,cqhh133,3,t5_37nu2
