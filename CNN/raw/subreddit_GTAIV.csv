9885000,0,t3_5g8ia3,Yeah I just installed it fresh and its the same thing here.  While the aggregate framerate might be a bit higher I personally consider to be even worse and lessplayable than it was on the threeyearold laptop I just replaced.  That stuttering was downright headacheinducing not to mention screwing with my timing while driving.Edit Ironically by pushing up the settings to insane levels where its no longer trying to do a  FPS framerate it somehow smoothed out the stuttering. facepalm,GTAIV,daw1eyq,1,t5_2somy
