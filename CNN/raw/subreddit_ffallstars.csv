1762523,0,t1_ck1ba8b,Haha that seems to be what the consensus thinks. Im still pretty confident in my team. Would have liked Stacy to drop to me in the third but I can manage with Rashad and Reggie. I think TY will have a big year for Indy and Cruz.. Im a bit more skeptical about but I felt it was a safe enough pick considering where I got him. ,ffallstars,ck1bmkk,2,t5_32xw5
