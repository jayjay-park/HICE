37495,0,t3_1ujgq1,I derive a lot of my ethics from two ideas humans are in general a social species as physical beings humans are intimately and wholly connected to the rest of the physical universeWhile theres more thinking to be done about how these can be used to work out everyday ethical problems they are my two base premises. The first bullet informs how I think I should treat other humans socially and the second informs how I think about my impact on the world. In fact the second bullet could subsume the first but I like the emphasis the first puts on social interaction and culture at least for me..,Ethics,ceip7q8,3,t5_2qp8u

The term gamergate is used to refer to the controversy as a whole the dialogue on twitter and various people angry about various things. The fiasco covers issues like ethics in journalism sexism in the video game industry sexism among gamers the causes and effects of online harassment and how they relate to those problems etc. You could write a book about it. What do you think about gamergate? is too broad of a question to reasonably tackle here in an indepth fashion. OP needs to pose a specific ethical question. ,Ethics,cpc9x2j,1,t5_2qp8u

If we are to build robust models of human interaction and engagement we must transform our acquiescence to the socially acceptable use of lying.  We must see willful exploitation of the ignorance of others as a part of lying and actively build transparency and integrity into the core of all our actions and interactions.   ltquotegtAlthough why you need a tldr for something so short is beyond me.

7628790,0,t1_d3952vs,Just because killing a given being is considered homicide in one case doesnt make it homicide in all cases. Capital punishment isnt homicide legal human euthanasia isnt homicide killing your opponent in a boxing match isnt homicide puling the plug on a family member in a coma isnt homicide. Its the same as the fact that someone else killing your dog is animal cruelty but euthanizing your dog properly is completely legal. Taking a life isnt black and white or necessarily illegal. A fetus rights are irrelevant I do not know why you think the legal system is designed to be concerned with the rights of a fetus. If to understand you need to see the rights of the situation rationalized the fetus doesnt have the right for legal abortion to be considered homicide just like a person in a coma who has life support taken away doesnt have the right for this to be considered homicide.A fetus is clearly living but its clearly different from a born human. It has its own set of laws like any special case. The legal system isnt how we discern what is moral or immoral what is to be considered a being with rights or a life. Nor must it follow a specific hairsplitting interpretation of such things. Quite simply to reiterate killing a human isnt necessarily homicide immoral or a violation of that humans rights.Also telling me Im missing the forest for the trees is an even more vague and pointless analogy than the comments by that other guy who thought going on about mandatory organ donation would help you.,Ethics,d39cp46,1,t5_2qp8u

9639690,0,t1_da19koz,No in each case you describe wisdom. Compassion is not only for the wise antivaxxers and criminals are capable of feeling for others even if their reasoning around that feeling is wrong. Moral reasoning is ethics and these people respond to their sense of compassion with unethical behaviour in the first place or bad or misinformed moral reasoning in the second. Im afraid I still see circularity. Youre now saying compassion is ethics and  only exists when it is proven correct by hindsight. Can a mercy killing then be compassionate under your construction if we can never know what might have happened had death not occurred?Im not sure how much longer we can proceed here.

10491833,0,t3_5q89em, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are privateExactly this is one part which I see very critically. Facebook and Twitter might be private corporations but the space they offer is an extension of the common sphere.If they ban someone they ban them from a part of their social interactions thats at least true for facebook. So it is to be taken seriously.The problem many people have is not that facebook and twitter try to inforce some rules of common decency but that political interest groups are pushing into their power structures to bludgeon people with differing opinions.And unlike the examples of court rulings the bans on Facebook and Twitter are often intransparent and undisputable to the person being banned. It is a structure which is very abusable since any checks and balances are missing  because it is seen as a private company which can do whatever it wants.,Ethics,dcxcy9h,2,t5_2qp8u

To be honest Id go with reading the Wikipedia articles on consequentialismutilitarianism Kantian ethics and virtue ethics then read the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy articles on the same. Then go for some anthology or other of applied ethics. Look up the editors of anthologies if theyre an academic at a reputable university the books probably fine.

10971355,0,t3_5wm1y9,In some jurisdictions there are legal requirements for disclosure.  For example in pretty much all Canadian provinces youd have to offer disclosure statementsestoppel certificates outlining the issues in some detail.  You should find out what the minimum standard for disclosure is in your jurisdiction and plan to at least meet and ideally exceed that standard.Bear in mind that sales contracts are still contracts and require a meeting of the minds to be valid.  If a buyer later believes you failed to disclose relevant information that prevented a proper meeting of the minds from occurring a legal dispute is likely and there is a good chance youd lose if you withheld relevant information.,Ethics,debm8t9,2,t5_2qp8u
