642021,0,t1_cgauxzx,Hello me again... This is my speculationThe Spanish government will should require them to follow the contract. If they violate the contract you probably have a legal right to prosecute them. To what extent I dont know. Generally youd probably have the same rights as a foreigner working in Spain who had their employment contract violatedIn my comment I gave you before I told you to seek out an attorney in the potential host country the language barrier and the difference in laws being precisely why. However today umegshoe informed me see above comment that aupairworld does have free copies of contracts for APs in multiple languages including Spanish. Its up to you if you trust this or still want to seek out an attorney yourself.   Link,Aupairs,cgd8y8c,1,t5_2sp0r

4271934,0,t3_39w7m9,Hello! I am currently an aupair in Germany. Im an American from Canada and Ive been overseas for a little over four months now.First things first. You should NOT become an aupair if you just want to travel. This is a huge nono. If childcare is not a priority you will find your year very long. Also if childcare is not something you like the family and the children will notice it quickly and they may not like that very much. As opposed to what you may think you do not have that much time nor resources to travel. So unless you bring tons of cash with you chances are you are not going to be leaving your country as often as you please. If traveling is all you want then I recommend trying other things like backpacking couch surfing which is not really a great idea when youre a girl traveling alone or a student exchange trip.That aside. Personally I did not choose an agency since I did not have the mean to pay for one. I used Aupair World and I believe its just as good. You create your profile for free and when youre ready you can start looking for families. You can choose to have families that matches your profile to show or you can search through all families. Some criteria they will ask you to fill are location city size or village time period date number of children single parent or not etc. While looking for families there will be people with tons of pictures and informations on their profiles some with very few. However not everyone without a picture or not much information is being fraudulent. Sometimes parents are just not comfortable putting pictures of their children online and thats okay. Once you find a family you are interested in or a family has contacted you start asking preliminary questions. Heres a list of possible things you may ask during that first contact.Getting to know each other from Aupair WorldWhich questions should I ask my host family? from Aupair WorldInterviewing What questions should Au Pairs ask Families? from Aupair Mom Questions an Au Pair should ask YOU to make a good match. from Aupair MomAU PAIR QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR FUTURE HOST FAMILY from Speaking DenglishThen if youre still interested schedule a Skype interview or a phone call. Obviously a Skype interview is more reliable since you see the people. During that Skype interview you can go through more specific questions some you can find in the links provided. If you do not feel safe you can always request a background check. I think many people will give you one since they understand that moving to a foreign country is a huge risk. If you are coming to Europe chances are you will have to take language courses and normally the host family will have to pay for it or a portion of it. And again yo said you wanted to work in Europe. Well being an aupair is a job! Its not something you do on the side. You have to dedicate yourself to it. So it will be your job! However some aupairs take jobs on the side but then if you truly want to travel as well not sure youll have time for that. Also some countries may not allow you to take a parttime job. It depends on the type of visa the country requires for Aupairs. For instance Germany has an aupair visa and you are not allowed to do any other work with that visa.All in all reconsider the reasons why you want to be an aupair. It is extremely fun but childcare is the most important aspect of it. You will be working for a family and not just left to do whatever whenever. Also your pay will be quite low. Of course everything is paid for but you might want to think about budgeting and not blowing your money on traveling all the time. Lastly fix your schedule after youve find a match. Nothing says you will have the time required to accomplish everything you want. Being an aupair is probably  traveling  staying local and  childcare. ,Aupairs,cs75x6b,3,t5_2sp0r
5624082,0,t3_3pa25c,As a host dad I think that is a completely loaded question and it angers me.  If you work for minimum wage you simply cannot afford a house in a nice neighborhoodcarfoodcell phone etc on your own in fact most people with middle class incomes live in debt or scrape by paycheck to paycheck. I think many people with jobs dont have much money left at the end of paying their bills.Making week as an Au Pair is far more like a student or a child who receives a week allowance. When all your other expenses are paid for week is actually not an insignificant amount of money because the only thing you have to purchase with it is clothing and occasionally maybe gas money for travel.When our au pairs show up they get a laptop a car a cell phone a gym membership and a gift certificate to go shopping. We pay them only the  USDweek but I dont feel like I am exploiting them for a second. After you factor in costs of living the visa their hourly wages food tuition matching etc. being an Au Pair pays far far better than working for minimum wage.Even for vacations it costs nothing to vacation with the family and when you travel around the country you can usually stay with other au pairs and families for free so there are no hotel costs really.I think our au pairs are doing better than most the people I know with regular jobs. ,Aupairs,cwu7yq0,1,t5_2sp0r
7920379,0,t1_d467m5m,I was an au pair from  and theres a two year Visa restriction so Im not allowed back until the end of Julybeginning of August next year haha. ,Aupairs,d46bpzk,1,t5_2sp0r
9306897,0,t3_52m2mz,I lived with a family in Germany and the host dad sounds just like your host mom. I was expected to be in the kitchen by  with their breakfasts prepared before they even came downstairs around . I was working from    or later though the kids spent large parts of most weekdays in the kindergarten. I was constantly intentionally mistreated by the older boy  which the father ignored and the younger boy  would do things similar to what you described and was usually babied by the parents. To be honest just be glad you are getting out so early. There is no way that situation would be good for you. Good luck finding someone new. I know how scary and shitty that situation is  ,Aupairs,d8vpss1,1,t5_2sp0r
10446782,0,t1_dcs7uqq,But it still is not a regular working visa if her time with the family ends she will still need to make money somehow unless shes loaded.Good luck!,Aupairs,dcs8b7g,1,t5_2sp0r
10773386,0,t1_ddr6gol,Thank you. I just found out through a friend that she is looking for a new au pair. He wanted me to help him make a new ad but I refused. I dont feel right letting someone else get into this situation.,Aupairs,ddr7359,2,t5_2sp0r
