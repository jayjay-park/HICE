2001918,0,t3_2hc2fq,Mott Haven is a shithole. I lived there . Bulletproof chinese food and liquor stores. No or few restaurants. No retail other than Kennedy Fried Chicken. Supermarket was full of expired and rancid food only one credit card machine for the entire store. Helicopters hovering above and gunshots heard outside my window. What a terrible place. The New York Times attempted to rebrand Mott Haven in the mid s as SoBro. That didnt work. Such a shithole. Good riddance.  ,bronx,ckufi0w,0,t5_2ruo6
