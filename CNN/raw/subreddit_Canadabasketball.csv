1585352,0,t3_2bntcs,DraftExpress my personal go to for reliable draft info does not have any Canadian players in their  mock draft. Id watch the guys uAndrewGaines mentioned. A few of them could see their draft stock rise enough to get drafted if they have stellar seasons in . You should keep an eye on Trey Lyles  there has been enough hype surrounding him for him to go oneanddone if he has a great freshman campaign.,Canadabasketball,cjf07x5,1,t5_2xw7y
