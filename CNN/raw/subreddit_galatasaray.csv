201324,0,t1_cf19yny,It sounds more like something told to the media to shut everyone up about how Gaziantep are going out of their way to help Galatasaray and that they are under our command or something. Im also pretty sure that even if there was a buyout option it wont actually be carried out. The most important reason for which is that this isnt salve trade they cant force Bruma to join them permanently and I can assure you that Bruma will not want to play for Gaziantep when he already has a spot in our squad.,galatasaray,cf1dgdf,2,t5_2re7h

In april we will be playing Fenerbahce and Kasimpasa at home I believe. You wont be able to get tickets for Fenerbahce they sell out before they are released to the general public. Kasimpasa tickets are doable though. The subway goes to Aslantepe. So if youre staying near Taksim or Sultan Ahmet the classic tourist locations youll get there fine.

He seems to have blocks for feet when it comes to passingoneonone but his positioning was amazing over the past  years which fits his playstyle.

Keita is a good example of the Fener media shaping public opinion on our players and manipulating the views of our own supporters. Who cares about Keitas antics against Kaka in the World Cup ? We have to stand strong and support our players unless they betray the team like Servet. I am glad that  our supporters are not making the same mistake with Melo like they did with Keita.

658247,0,t1_cgf37kc,I think this is as good a chance as he can get to play him as we desperately need a defender and were dropping points anyway we tried Hakan in a lot of matches and hes just not good as a CB. His only redeeming quality is that he can pass and he didnt even do that in the last two games.Other than that Mancini bought Salih Hajrovic Ontivero Burdisso Umut and a few others but only Telles plays. Thats either bad transfer management or bad choice of starting elevens. And finally I dont get the Semih is a bad example thing.

11488529,0,t3_63zhmd,Very interesting read although I have to say that we didnt see much from Tudor just yet. I think its too early to start chanting his name. That will change however when we play like we did last game against some bigger teams. Dont get me wrong I fully support the guy but we also had incredible games and good football under various other coaches Its consistency that they all couldnt bring to the table. If Tudor can stick to his guns and actually show a consistent playstyle  hes our man. I do agree on his non worldclassplayer mentality. We shouldve done these replacements a very long time ago. With that said I also dont want Terim in our club. He gets paid a fortune and is really unreliable. Another thing is that he doesnt let anyone near his ideas if he has a plan he goes for it no matter the criticism. All because of his huge ego. We should play  next game too just to confirm or not if the formation REALLY suits us better or if the performance had some other reason such as motivation opponent first XI atmosphere yeah lol etc.,galatasaray,dfy8223,3,t5_2re7h
