8473099,0,t1_d60msul,They have been coming to my porch for the last few days. One was watching me eat through the window haha.  I gave them some oats. Now one or two of them come back every day. Im getting closer to them every day.  He stopped squawking and started making noises like rd almost. I think he was mimicking my camera,wildlifephotography,d60ofvh,2,t5_2xscr

8869985,0,t3_51opbq,I checked out the rest of your photos Very nice!Interesting to see the Equipment used as well. I got a Nikon D and I plan on buying a nikkor mm as well.How do you like the lense so far?,wildlifephotography,d7e1pn8,2,t5_2xscr
8875639,0,t1_d7e6kzw,I have the sigma  and I find it ok it isnt as sharp as those K lenses out there but I find that it gives me fine images even at mm.  My only complaint is that it does really start to lose sharpness when cropping those photos shot at mm.  As long as I dont have to crop much then the pictures I get out of it are just plenty good.  I do like the VR in it EXAMPLE this was slow and handheld at mm.  I also have the new nikon  f which admittedly has reduced my use of my sigma because of weight.  I shoot a lot of sports outside and that  is nice for that  but the  is so much lighter i find that i really enjoy carrying it all day much more than the heavier glass.,wildlifephotography,d7eq67b,2,t5_2xscr

9989278,0,t1_db6qxz9,Let me found out about local guides. Oz is just like the States where you can camp and selfguide especially is you are a local. I think the aboriginal people  Indigenous Australians are the best guides. The lodges will be super expensive and possibly no fun at all. Camping amp WD is the best if you are OK with sharing habitat with snakes and spiders. Outback farmers are super friendly and will help anyone in trouble. You just need to register with the police before venturing deep in the outbackdesert so that a search party can be deployed if you go AWOL. Since some of the most untouched outback areas belong to aboriginal people you may not be allowed there without permission. Yes I am looking forward to seeing the Tasmanian Tiger in my lifetime. At least the Tasmanian Devil is still around despite the facial tumor cancer which almost wiped out the entire population. Cheers mate.,wildlifephotography,db9mpg1,1,t5_2xscr
