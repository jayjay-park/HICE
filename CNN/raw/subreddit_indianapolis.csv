Swingers  person relationships whatever you want BUT I dont think we should ever allow polygamist marriage. Obvious legal reasons aside I dont believe polygamist relationships are good for the children. If I was presented with research that said otherwise Id change my mind but everything Ive ever seen or read about relationships with children in general is that the  parent opposite or same sex is best for child rearing. I think people in general though should be free to do as the please so while I oppose polygamy personally I dont think it should be outlawed. ,indianapolis,cey8r5c,0,t5_2rtt2

Given that so many students in the district qualify for the federal program it makes sense.  The district will still have all parents fill out the federal nutrition program forms.

1142900,0,t1_chxu8vq,Its not all tax incentives. We are also really lacking in facilities and resources. The closest camera rental house is in Chicago Cincinnati or I think Louisville. We have one major grip amp lighting equipment rental house. No stages etc. Its a chickenoregg situation since you cant get one thing without the other. You could try but itd be risky to set up shop without the incentive there to cover costs and ensure a steady stream of business. Hammer in Indianapolis does pretty well since theyre the only game in town.States like Louisiana Illinois and Pennsylvania and even Michigan for a time until I believe they didnt decide to continue them have seen a huge boom in their film industries thanks to the incentivesbut also for being wellequipped. There is a push right now to get laws passed to bring film productions here but Im not sure how effective it will be. Seems shortsighted. I dont think you can open the doors and say were open! and just expect everyone to flood in. Theres more to it than that. Our pool of readytowork crew members is small and not very privy to letting people in. So you might have enough locals to crew one mediumbudget movie. But everyone else has left the state where the money is. EDIT Not to mention many of the most important trades are unionbased grips electricians camera ADs etc. and didnt we pass the righttowork recently?AND even if incentives are passed and filmsTV shows come here... theres no guarantee the crews will be  locals. Im sure language in the legislature will define how many people are needed to fulfill the tax incentive requirements but a big problem in other states is productions not hiring locals and bringing people in from outofstate to fill even small positions.As an aside it has been amusing reading the reaction by Hoosiers to it not being shot here. Cities double for other cities all the time. I cant imagine other cities get upset when they are depicted by another. Or maybe they do who knows?,indianapolis,chy6rmf,6,t5_2rtt2

3755212,1,t3_33f5o4,First of all welcome to Indianapolis  Hope you love living in the nations most affordable city.As mentioned are you from New York City or elsewhere in the state? If you are from the city and want to remain in a vibrant area full of people Downtown is the best choice by far. Dont expect New York City amenities though as no other city in the country is New York. Finally the water here is fine as long as you dont swim in the white river or fall creek after a major rainstorm. Over  inches of rain in a day or so and raw sewage will flow into them. This is being fixed with the deep tunnel project which should come online within the next year. Downtown has some nice green river trails though.

Weather is more or less the same as youre used to my friends back east actually got much more snow than we did this year but it varies. People in Indianapolis are friendly and much more patient than New Yorkers. You can stall at a green light and no one will even honk at you! That blew my mind when I first came to live here. The lack of decent public transportation is jarring but you can cover all of downtown Indy on foot faster than you can walk from one end of Central Park to the other so... Ive enjoyed the lower stress and more affordable living but damn do I miss the pizza. ETA We are along a river but I HATE being landlocked. Its a . hour drive up to the Lake Michigan shore.

4435856,0,t3_3bvasm,I have had Brighthouse for cable and internet for over  years. I only have had one outage which lasted for an evening. Ive probably had to restart my cable box  times over those  years due to it acting weird. I pay about   month including fees taxes and modem rental for regular cable not basic regular so ESPN History Discovery etc but no HBO or any of the premium channels and Mb internet one cable box and no DVR. I use my own wireless router. This isnt a promotion price. It used to be  when I started. I need to call and do the I want to cancel dance to lower it. No contract is a plus. I used to torrent a bit but have since stopped. I never got a letter or noticed any throttling. Their customer service has been good. I use auto pay so I have had no billing issues. I had a remote start acting funny. I called them up and they mailed me a new one no questions asked. I also called to order the Mayweather Pacquiao fight a few hours before it started and it was simple and easy. In fact it was all automated took one minute.Only issues is the cable box takes a few minutes to boot up when the power goes out but I am sure this is for all cable boxes. Plus I have used the same cable box the whole time so maybe mine is old. Also when scrolling through the channels list quickly when you stop the show description is like one channel behind the one currently highlighted. It doesnt bother me but some may find it annoying. Hope this helps.EDIT Oh! I forgot one thing that Brighthouse did that pissed me off. A few years ago I am watching the Pacers vs Lakers... I think it was two years ago. West coast game so it was late almost midnight. th Quarter Pacers down one G Hill scores a layup with  second left to put the Pacers up . I am freaking out excited.

The fix addressed some of those concerns and Pence and legislative leaders have mentioned several times since that theyre going to approach some more all encompassing legislation next year.

Maybe it changed I dont know.These arent my morals and this is evolution because that is how evolution works.  Human intelligence has blocked basic biological evolution in some areas but in some areas it hasnt.  I dont care what people do so long as they dont demand I be held in some way responsible for whatever consequences they bring upon themselves.  I didnt see anything in the OP where it said these were all dumb teenagers.  I can assure you that if high school is failing sex ed anyone who goes to college gets plenty of sex facts  so after about age  or  STD transmission rates should drop.

6815642,0,t3_493wns,First question Do you have a car?  As someone that also moved from Chicago to Indy I can tell you that it is a necessity here.  Compared to Chicago public transport basically doesnt exist.As for renting fountain square and irvington are both good options.  Yes they are higher crime areas but they arent too high.  Lock your doors and windows and invest in an alarm system and youll be  fine.  I would give you that advice regardless of where you wanted to live.  My girlfriend used to live in Fountain Square and we never felt unsafe and we walked around quite a bit.  You can definitely rent a place in Fountain Square for around  or less.  Im less familiar with Irvington.I currently live on the south side of Indy right north of Greenwood.  If youre willing to spend a hundred or so more my rent is  a month you can rent a very nice place and the area is very safe.  When I was looking to rent around this area most prices were between .  Its about a  minute drive downtown for me so its not too far if you want to go into the city.  Id recommend looking around here and Beech Grove for houses to rent.Edit  Broad Ripple is also a good option but the nightlife around there is quite active so prices are higher because of demand.,indianapolis,d0oumq2,20,t5_2rtt2

People generally dont get ticketed unless there was blatant negligence that the cop could prove.The situation you describe is kind of an automatic at fault situation for the other driver being that traffic on the roadway always has the right of way and the person entering the roadway from private property always has to yield. Theres no need for tickets or witnesses or anything.As long as there werent any serious injuries or fatalities the responding officer isnt going to conduct an elaborate crash investigation to determine liability. If it was a traffic signal for instance and you both claimed to have the green light then youd run into issues.

I think it took  minutes to cut around my ears.  I went back to him  months later guessing that he did a LOT of haircuts in between and I think it took him about  minutes.  Just slow and timid with the tools.  The place is always busy and the  minute drive sucks when they are too busy to take you.

11542700,0,t3_64r02g,Only about  of every  apartments currently sit vacant in Indy. So... no. Occupancy rates are through the roof and the chances of being able to negotiate are slim to none. Were about to hit the summer months where occupancy rates spike so the number of apartments on the market is likely to decline in the near future. The bright side is that the market appears to finally be stabilizing a bit. So the  growth in rent since  should be stagnating soon if not coming down in the next few years. ,indianapolis,dg4d7oz,14,t5_2rtt2

11651664,0,t1_dggdhn2,I think the main difference is when you limit the ability for poor people to even exist in a neighborhood. Poor people wont exist in Carmel. There is nothing for them there because shops are boutique cops will pull junky or suspicious cars over and there are no houses that they can afford. But the houses on Meridian are within a few blocks from lower income housing. You can build a fence but youre sharing the same roads sidewalks gas stations as lower income class. Thats the whole point of suburbs. Creating a whole area where a class of people cant reach you. Thats why some people hate bus lines going through their suburb because it gives access to the poor to your area. ,indianapolis,dggqaz4,7,t5_2rtt2

Secondly the reason I specified before was what was stated direcly by the deputy mayor about  or  months ago after having meeting with the engineers architects and Salesforce.  She was saying that the transition of Chase Tower to Salesforce Tower was all but complete as the name on top still needed changed.  She then said that the Salesforce logo is rather large and the roof of the tower is rather small believe it or not.

11809661,0,t1_dgyisbd,Then perhaps you ought to be less content about those blinders youre wearing. You are being stubbornly ignorant in the face of facts that the playing field is level and that choices made lifestyles lived or in a completely loaded dog whistle way survival of the most fortunate reproductive habits are the factors at play. Actual money in large amounts was given to generations of white Americans be it for services earned like the GI Bill or just for taking advantage of an opportunity. But that same money was denied to black Americans whether they met the same qualifications or not. Good for you if you and your ancestors put poverty behind you. Many hardworking responsible black Americans would still love the same opportunities. From slavery to the present day the opportunities afforded to black Americans have been fewer and lesser. Its great to see anyone lift themselves up and succeed but ignorance and ugliness are the only reasons to uphold keeping people down and blaming them for failing. tldr You wouldnt have the opportunities you did unless previous generations of your family had the opportunities they did. ,indianapolis,dgynzmf,3,t5_2rtt2
