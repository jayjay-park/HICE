3297354,0,t1_corvnnx,i agree somewhat here.  I use my scrub more and more which really surprised me.  I made an initial rough chamfer along the edge of a long large table in no time with my scrub.  The fore is good but the idea with a scrub is that the thinner sole means easier pushing.  btw thx for hanging here.  you make great comments.,handtools,cp44i6p,1,t5_352si
3344971,0,t3_2yg9tu,A lot of who makes The Best is very subjective.  For example I cannot stand Veritas bevel up plane handles.  They literally cause my handwrist pain to the point that I cannot plane for the rest of the day.  My Low Angle Jack stayed in the drawer until I swapped the handle.  Others swear by them.Chisels are a similar issue.  So much about what makes a good chisel is edge retentionease of sharpening and then comfortbalance.Ashley Ilses makes nice tang chisels from simple O steel.  They are probably my favorite in the  per chisel range.LieNielsens Socket chisels are pretty nice available in both A and O.  I have gotten away from using socket chiselsthey just dont balance right to me.  But they work well.  I had a  set and they did every thing I need them to.I currently love the Veritas PMv chisels.  Lovely balance and I dig the super steel.  That said I consider them quite luxurythey are SPENDY.For saws its all over the place.  Veritas LieNielsen BadAxe and about  other people and small shops make fine saws.The bigger thing here is that there isnt really a list split by Okay Good Best.  Its a binary check  Will this tool work well out of the box with minimal to no effort and do fine work?,handtools,cp9jv4i,3,t5_352si
3558612,0,t3_30ztkg,I dont think you should spend money on a Jack or Fore plane from LieNielsen or Lee Valley unless they serve a specific function in your shop.  ie you work on sufficiently small projects that a  or  would be your jointer plane.For jack or fore tasks hogging wood go vintage.  A woodie or a Stanley  or  can be had cheaply.  If its a little beat up thats fine.  If the sole isnt entirely flat thats probably fine too.  A Fore is not a precision instrument.  At least not on the scale as a jointer plane is.I am however of the opinion that the Low Angle Jack LN  and similar are jackofalltrade Jacks.  I have the Veritas version and it is a true utility plane.Because of how quickly I can pull out the blade and resharpen it I use it for gross tasks like planing the edge of a plywood panel.  Less fiddling with the chip breaker.  Its also my dedicated shooting plane.I dont like BU planes as roughing planes or true jacks.  Due to the bedding angle you need a more severe camber to get the same functional camber in a BD down plane.I dont like BU as smoothers.  A BD plane has a chip breaker.  I can plane against the grain with a chip breaker.  To hell with tight mouths!  The one advantage here is a BU plane with a  degree blade.  You now have turned your plane in a scraping plane.  Scraping tends to not give you as good a surface as a planed surface but now and then you have no choice.My personal preference but I dont like BU planes as jointers either.  I like the tippy feeling of a BD plane.  It helps me feel out of plumb better.  Others find more feed back from BUs.  This is very much a preference thing.Before just buying a new plane what planes do you currently have?  The right one for you might be one you havent considered!,handtools,cpxwna6,3,t5_352si

5424519,0,t3_3pb221,I wouldnt go straight to the workbench but maybe start with a pair of saw benches first. The saw benches will provide you with a surface to prepare and assemble the workbench top then youll use the workbench top on the saw benches to prepare and joint the workbench legs.I have recently built a floor tool chest without using any workbench using a pair of saw horses and the panels themselves as a work surface. It was less of a hassle than I expected. Toolwise youll need the following minimal kit for both projects a square a bevel gauge a straight edge winding sticks a pair of aluminum corner profiles is cheap and effective marking gauge a crosscut saw a rip saw a back saw for the joinery planes to prepare the stock. The minimum would be a jack with  irons... a curved one to thickness a straight one to flatten.  chisels  and  or  as many clamps as you can affordLater on I would add the following items to the list rabbet plane  moving fillister plane  chisel more bench planes more clamps,handtools,cw51ed4,10,t5_352si
5777241,0,t1_cxd73m7,So I dont have a ton of historical sourcesthe only accurate one is really The Joiner and Cabinetmaker that was reprinted by Lost Art Pressbut I disagree that apprentices were the dimensioners.Sure we have Moxon and Roubo but as far as I know there isnt any other text that really talks about the daytoday of a cabinet shop thus why Im using The Joiner and Cabinetmaker.  Okay long winded setup over.I dont think apprentices planed stock simply because the risks were too high.  Wood is expensive.  If your apprentice screws up a board youre a little boned.  Yes he would eventually plane stock but more likely only on their work and projects.,handtools,cxd7z2w,1,t5_352si

9475730,0,t3_5ajetf,Just curious  what parts of the article did you disagree with?  I tend to ignore statements of impossible to verify historical facts that are included as introductions to more easily verified descriptions of techniques.  In other words while there is reason to trust the how the why is often speculation that has become a meme attaching itself to the description of how. The internet is a funny place...So I discounted the explanation having to do with the scarcity of clamps.  Its true that screw clamps particularly ones that used metal screws were expensive and sometimes hard to come by.  Even at times during the th Century in places other than the USA. But people used wedges for things like this a lot and its pretty trivially easy to make as many clamps as you like using wedges. Mr. Sellers does mention wedges.So if people used these joints a lot it was because they were intrinsically good not because they didnt have clamps.  Or at least because they were good enough.  Ive never used a sprung joint.  But my jointing technique is as follows  I clamp the two boards or sections of panels together in a bookmatch.  I then start in the middle of the edge and take a few swipes with my  or  if its a shorter panel.  I then start taking successively longer strokes symmetrically with respect to the center.  By the time the plane takes a continuous shaving from end to end the edges of both boards are as flat end to end  as that plane can make it.This is probably common knowledge but jointing the edges of both boards simultaneously in this way means that any deviations from square with respect to the faces cancel out  once you flip the boards back up their faces will automatically be at a degree angle when the boards are put together.If you like a little spring take a couple of strokes closer to each end.  It shouldnt be a lot just a tiny bit.,handtools,d9h36j0,2,t5_352si
9484766,0,t1_d9h9pkt,Ive never believed that reasoning.  If you expose the ends to liquid water yes and maybe if the piece if unfinished  but when dealing with the kind of relative humidity found inside a conditioned house on a finished table top... I just dont see the endgrain being any different.  Especially when you consider that its often sanded a bit more to create that burnish needed for proper finishing anyways.,handtools,d9i78zx,1,t5_352si
9857713,0,t1_dasgmwl,No you only need one straight edge. The other side is irrelevant.. Use your square to draw a line perpendicular to the straight edge. . Flip your square along its edge. Draw a new line perpendicular to the same straight edge as before and overlapping your first line. The stock is aligned to the same straight edge as before.. Make sure that the  lines are overlapping or parallel. ,handtools,dasheiv,3,t5_352si
