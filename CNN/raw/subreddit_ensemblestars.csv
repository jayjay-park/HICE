8572848,0,t1_d6d3azq,. luck increases the rate you fill a charas trust little bar under the mini chibi charas during produce lessons and the trust affects the amount of experience your cards gain after you finish the lesson!! according to the wiki it apparently also increases how often you trigger mini events but tbh i havent noticed a real difference so take that as you will. luck actually doesnt affect jewel drop rate!! it only affects trust gain. its random if youre looking to trigger a specific mini event the only thing id recommed is just following the chibi chara and keep tapping on the rooms hes in. ive never seen a sale like this happen before so if youre going to end up buying dias eventually anyway id just buy them now. aah did you mean the AP requirement was halved right now? it always happens in the period between regular events afaik theyve never outright specified a reason but as you said its probably to help gain more EXP,ensemblestars,d6d6s64,1,t5_38162

9413027,0,t3_59dwon,the subakoga bloomed animations are cute ...anyway Judgment is now in revival and the number is really high for ranking . I wasnt really expecting it to be that high probably more like m something ... because on paper it looks crazy though back then it was that crazy. also the math adds up so the m isnt a completely arbitrary number.Ive been brushed off by some newer players when I say knightsP are intense mostly because I guess all of their events now have been more or less average but they had that reputation for a reason. This is that reason.Im just really curious how theyre going to scale future events since m is pretty much average for ranking whereas it was just m for the revivals weve had so far. And well the Shinobu event went very high though Id still say Judgment was worse due to the fact that teams were a lot weaker back then no encore and no midway challenger at k iirc.,ensemblestars,d9960sy,1,t5_38162

10103956,0,t3_5kacye,I dont think theres any chance the game is so textbased that it would take ages to translate all existing content and new content would appear in the meantime. Event stories are longer and more complicated than stories in say SIF in which girls just hang out wherever and have simple cute chats. Plus as its been mentioned the characters have pretty complex speech patterns from Kuros rough but polite to Reis grandpa speech a question how do grandpas speak like in English? is there such a distinction? to Kanatas ????? the only way I can imagine of translating his speech would be      Not to mention okama...
