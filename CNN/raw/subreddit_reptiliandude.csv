10336424,0,t1_dcfnjth,To rephrase you in plain speak hydrogen particles WILL communicate instantaneously providing an answer to the beacon. The first human group to solve this scientific endeavor will answer it and represent us to the Assembly who initiated the beacon as the voice for humanity. Mob bosses seeking power are giddy over this opportunity. Legitimate governments who want to remain relevant should take the opportunity to beat them to it. They have the resources. Do they have the will?Right now Ael Kayeen aliens on this planet are doing everything they can to sabotage this effort. Aliens arent proven! they shout while donning humans as outter wear pretending to be us.  Forget micro it doesnt work with relativity! they proclaim.  Pay no attention to the WOW signal its just space noise! they lie. There is no God! they blaspheme to all who will listen.Will we let them manipulate us and retain their strangle hold on this world keeping us blind and subservient to their life extension business cheating us out of health and wealth and participation in the greater universe?Or will we be brave and work together to answer the beacon and step forward into the future as independent beings with a voice worthy of hearing? I think of those rotating micro hydrogen particles as the Instagram of the universe. We have pursued technological advancement for my entire lifetime. I watched men first walk on the moon. Now Im ready to meet the noble beings who live out there on other worlds who have visited and impacted humanity all along and finally shake their hands. ,reptiliandude,dcfowu5,1,t5_3fgdj
