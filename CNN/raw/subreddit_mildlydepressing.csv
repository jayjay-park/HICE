2717510,0,t3_2qf0tf,my god you are pathetic ... I am sorry but all you do is whine like a spoiled shit and want sympathy from us. Get over yourself. If you think your life is bad or that day was bad compared to others  you really should know about the real world mate. I am  too and my god all you are trying to do is trying to get others to sympathize for you eventhough nothing bad happened. YOUR FAMILY WAS SICK. So fucking what ? you are gonna blame them now cause you couldnt get drunk ? my god. ,mildlydepressing,cncyx4s,0,t5_2uvxv

9435293,0,t3_51gqo1,Its about the beauty of life not knowing all the information in the world. Yeah you can go find life hacks and delve into interesting topics but life is made fundamentally off of socializing. Trust me the more you surround yourself with people the sooner youll see the point of what Im saying. Youll never get there if you never try. You dont form a true BOND with people over the internet. And about those meaningless convos those are not real friends trust me. Real ones you can talk to for hours on end without being bored. Its called being compatible something that too many people dont find soon enough,mildlydepressing,d9bzmc6,1,t5_2uvxv
