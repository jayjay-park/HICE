6525650,0,t1_czu96gq,Yeah Ive got them and theyre both great but doing it on a GBV album doesnt seem right. I get that GBV is something thats changed a lot over time but its always been a fullband thing. Im wondering if hes doing it just to tour the GBV songs again. Its a good enough reason for me but I guess I just want to hear Bobby Bare Jr in the studio with them. Hes an intriguing musician.,GBV,czuayot,5,t5_2rzal
