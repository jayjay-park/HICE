276831,0,t1_cf922kw,Sorry my young friend but you are mistaken again. Go back and re read. I said  You seem to suggest that the ONLY value a cow or carrots may have is their ability to nourish you or other humans. I can think of nothing more backward sociopathic or narcissistic than this.I am clearly referencing the IDEA not the individual espousing the idea. If you want to have rational discussion you will have to learn to distinguish the two. Ive re read my comments and see no hostility toward you merely the ideas you are spouting which are of course ferociously backward. Again Im not saying YOU are ferociously backward I am saying those IDEAS are ferociously backward. If you like I can insult you directly simply to make my point but Id rather not do that.,Vegetarianism,cf9gfnq,1,t5_2qhzr

3168397,0,t1_coqabkg,No Im sorry. I should have clarified that I am trying to move away from eggs and dairy. Or at least buy less of those things. Ive never eaten breakfast meats. Ive only ever liked beef chicken venison buffalo and occasionally mahi mahi or crab. I stopped all but chicken eggs and dairy about  months ago. I have had chicken  or  times this year but am trying to cut that out entirely. Now I want to gradually  cut out dairy and eggs.,Vegetarianism,coqeilj,5,t5_2qhzr

4446196,0,t1_csqt5xj,You are consuming meat and increasing the demand for meat.You are acting in a way that is inconsistent.People who know that you are a vegetarian will additionally conclude that vegetarians eat meat.

5343799,0,t3_3o7e0z,Ive been vegetarian for years and I dont remember a change at that time but I was on the pill too. However I recently went vegan end of June and I have noticed some differences. In the past year my period has been on a really regular  day cycle with each period lasting  days stronger in the first  days and weaker in the last . Since going vegan  out of  periods Ive had have been late and started off with just spotting for  days. So yeah there have been some changes. I was totally freaking out the first time it was late because it NEVER is and it had been  months since I had sex so I was freaking out that I was having one of those crazy hidden pregnancies that you dont have any kind of symptoms of until youre about to give birth. I was also experiencing a really increased appetite which just contributed to that fear. But at the same time I was also going through a lot of transitions moving starting grad school etc. which could have contributed so the diet probably isnt the only factor.,Vegetarianism,cvuqaad,3,t5_2qhzr

5783347,0,t1_cxdxixi,Also most people paying for those better deaths arent getting what you pictured even if thats what they imagined.  Its simply too inefficient to do large scale. Did you read about the humane turkey meat from Whole Foods? They literally had multiple farms and hid most of the poor animals at a more typical farm while misleading people using the nicer one for show. ,Vegetarianism,cxdz9l2,1,t5_2qhzr
5985253,0,t1_cy3wape,gt You sound a bit angry about this I cant imagine why. You have your experience with it and I have mine. I was born to vegetarians and raised as one. Lived  yrs of my life as a vegetarian very little dairy mostly whole foods  grains lentils veggiesfruit and very low fat and a couple more as a vegan. Growing up I was skinny and weak. As a young adult I became fat and insulinresistant. It wasnt until I introduced animal protein in my diet and reduced carbs that I was able to control the blood sugar issue.Animal protein is not something I prefer given my upbringing and also love of animals and Im trying to eat more lowcarb vegetarian foods but its not easy  most veg protein sources have more carbs in them than protein with the exception of tofuseitan and protein powders.Anyway congrats and good luck to you!,Vegetarianism,cy4755x,1,t5_2qhzr

8525578,0,t3_4vqvbv,Thats some red pill rage for you right there. Every new vegan goes through this. Just keep your mouth shut. The fact is that peoples opinions are extremely hard to change once their minds are made up. The best way to get people to transition if that is what you are looking to do is to become extremely good at cooking and always have good and healthy food around you. Then if their health starts to drop or they become interested you can explain the benefits. But you should only do that if people ask you let them come to you dont go to them. And trust me people will ask.,Vegetarianism,d679dbq,3,t5_2qhzr
