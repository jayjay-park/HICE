His guitar teacher always saw him getting along well with his younger sister he thought they were great friends.Its scary to think that someone who always seemed pretty normal could be secretly planning to murder a slew of people including a family that had never wronged him.But also think about the kid. He obviously has some sort of mental illness psychopathy probably? Im not a pdoc.

1405679,0,t3_22yomk,I WEAR camo so I can feel safe says Sean a member of the navy reserve. He cannot quite fathom why his combat uniform is different from that of other American servicemen in the field depending on whether they are members of the army the air force or the marines. And soon it may be different no longer for after years of ludicrously expensive design rivalry the defence appropriation for  prohibits the services from designing new uniforms unless they will be used by all members of the armed forces.Remarkably the Department of Defence has no single department dedicated to researching developing and procuring the best uniforms for all troops. This caused no problems before  when nearly every serviceman had a choice between a greenish camouflage uniform or a coffee stain desert pattern. But over the past  years the services have each created their own style of camouflage. The effect has been both costly and occasionally embarrassing.The marines led the way in  with a versatile and effective new combat uniform which also served to boost corps morale because the marine insignia was embedded in the design. This inspired a cascade of oneupsmanship among the other services. The air force for instance spent several years and more than m designing a new tigerstripe uniform that proved unsuitable for combatthe camouflage was ineffective the trousers were uncomfortable and the fabric was too heavy leading to heat buildup. The navy spent a lot less money developing the aquaflage uniform but that is a silly blue ensemble that works best where sailors may least wish to blend in the water.The worst offender has been the army. The service spent years and about .m developing its own universal camouflage. This pattern was designed to work anywhere but proved useless nearly everywhere. Soon after it was introduced in  soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan began complaining that the pattern turned them into targets. Troops from Syria and China were clearly better equipped. Reports suggest that a highranking military official had chosen the pattern without consulting the data from years of studies. The army is said to have spent at least  billion on uniforms and equipment printed in this camouflage which is still in use. In an emergency measure the army kitted out soldiers in Afghanistan in a new pattern starting in  spending more than .m on replacement gear in fiscal  and .Part of the problem explains Timothy ONeill a retired lieutenantcolonel and camouflage expert is that officers can be a bit too preoccupied with a uniforms CDI chicks dig it factor. This vanity together with bungled trials missteps and a lack of cooperation put the cost of developing these uniforms at more than m according to a report from the Government Accountability Office GAO in . This does not include the extra costswhich the GAO estimates in the tens of millions of dollarsof managing the stock and supply of so many different combat uniforms. Nor does it include the high costs of replacing ineffective camouflage in the field. The armed forces spent around m on camouflage uniforms in  alone.Stunned by these price tags Congress in  directed the Department of Defence to raise standards and cut costs. But little has been done. Many soldiers see the wisdom of returning to a shared uniform. But not the marines who will stick to their pattern like a hobo on a ham sandwich in the words of General James Amos commandant of the marine corps.It is unclear what all this means for the army which has been spending millions of dollars testing different patterns for a new camouflage since . It recently started tests for possible new uniforms which will continue until the end of September. Replacing the services flawed camouflage and equipment could cost another  billion over five years according to the GAO. Research and development in government is always a long and painstaking process says Mr ONeill. But if it were easy then the government would waste even more money and faster.From the print edition United States ,usanews,cishctx,1,t5_2rf3d

2507244,0,t1_cmlmubk,I couldnt agree with you more. One problem is people who should be having kids cant afford to and the ones who shouldnt kids are having too many. They end up mooching off the govt and dont get jobs because if they make too much money then their benefits are cut off. This results in them having too many kids because they get  benefits per child. The system is not helping the right people and needs some serious reform. You are  right about your European immigrant comment and let me tell you why. I am a Christian of the Middle East Assyrian and we left in the early s because of the muslim uprisings of the late s. We thankfully ended up in the states parents got educations learned english and now everyone one my aunts uncles and cousins owns a business and homes including myself essentially living the American dream. we adapted to this country we respect the rule of law we came to America and adapted to the culture as everyone should. The problem Europe is seeing Ill probably get down voted for this but its the truth is that they are getting a heavy flood of non educated muslim immigrants who are not willing to adapt or respect the rule of law they expect Europeans to abide by their muslim beliefs and are not willing to change not all of them of course. The Transatlantic trip to the US is too expensive so they end up in Europe and I think Europeans are now starting to see the affects of this. Essentially what can happen is that these minorities can grow and take over the majority of the population. What can possibly happen next is scary. Lets say that a country like Belgium grows its muslim population to  of its residents they in turn can vote in their elected leaders these leaders who now control majority of the govt and can essentially start changing laws based on their religious beliefs. Countries that this happens to all end up going to shit examples Iran and Lebanon.I have many westernized muslim friends who I respect because they dont force their values on me they adapt to American culture and respect the rule of law. Europeans arent so lucky they are dealing with uneducated people who are not willing to change to a western life and more importantly try to force their values on the country that took them in. America is fortunate to have a latino community they are some of the hardest working people I have ever met and never force anything on anyone.My guess is that the European countries who wise up to this will start doing things like banning the burka as they should. This will force those extremists to avoid coming and living in their country. If you dont want to adapt to a western life then stay in your bullshit repressive country simple as that. ,usanews,cmlu2uj,2,t5_2rf3d
