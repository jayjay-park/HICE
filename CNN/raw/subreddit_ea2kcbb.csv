3358577,0,t3_2yn3x8,Ok so I coached the first game. I used the automatic  minute halves which was far too short. The score was  at half with the teams shooting decent. I then went to halftime and started the second half but it didnt put my starters back in so I made a substitution. With  to go in the game they still hadnt gone in so I decided to sim the rest so the scoring might even out. Instead it moved from  to  as the final score. How can I make this version fun?,ea2kcbb,cpb3pid,1,t5_36w37
11484394,0,t3_63wvbq,God I would probably pay  for a good College Hooks K. I would basically make a version of NBA K minus all the glitches with the legacy mode of College hoops K. I loved the way K did recruiting and I loved starting at Western Illinois and working my way up to a major and winning a championship. Additionally maybe a MyPlayer type mode where you can start as a high school senior and get recruited by different schools based on how well you do in high school. ,ea2kcbb,dfxr5vp,4,t5_36w37
