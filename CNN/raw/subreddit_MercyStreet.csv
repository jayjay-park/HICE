6271366,0,t3_41h0xd,First episode did a lot of groundwork with the characters but it remains to be seen if the show can weave a story that keeps viewers coming back. I would love to see more outside shots that establish the broader historical era but Im afraid we will be stuffed into the hotel and house for the majority of the show. ,MercyStreet,cz2hfqv,3,t5_3ayvw
