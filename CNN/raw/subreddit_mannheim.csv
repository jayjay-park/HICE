3504775,0,t3_30c7fz,From my experience there you will meet a lot of international students. Unless you get paired up with Germans in class it was almost impossible to make German friends. The school throws a lot of parties which I recommend you go to. Visum also had a lot of cool trips which were pretty affordable. Visit City Doner for the best dners. The wassertum is gorgeous so make sure to check it out while the weather is nice. Mannheim was pretty cool but ugly compared to the neighboring city of Heidelberg. All and all I had a great time in Mannheim. Wasnt too small or too big. There is a chocolate factory in the city and sometimes the smell of Cacau would want to make me kill myself. Also make sure not to get stuck in Ulmenweg if you get student housing. ,mannheim,cprrp76,0,t5_2sqdl
