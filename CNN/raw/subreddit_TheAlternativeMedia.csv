9839000,0,t3_5g41vv,Promises by Presidentelect Donald Trump to deport millions of immigrants have drawn new attention to whether they can be detained indefinitely as they fight their cases. Currently immigrants have no right to a bond hearing. This is different from U.S. citizens who face trial in criminal court and can have a judge examine their case and determine if they should remain in jail until it is resolved. On Wednesday the Supreme Court held a hearing on this issue in a case that could give immigrants the same right. We speak with Alina Das a professor at the NYU School of Law where she codirects the Immigrant Rights Clinic and with Hilarion Joseph who was held for three years and two months in immigrant detention without a bond hearing when he faced deportation after his conviction for transporting weapons. He won his case and was released and this year he became a U.S. citizen.,TheAlternativeMedia,daq1maj,1,t5_3gsbr
