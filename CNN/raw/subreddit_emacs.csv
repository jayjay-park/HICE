303797,0,t1_cfc76rq,If you havent already tried it for a while I would encourage you to give it a fair shot but if ido scratches your itch that is absolutely what you should use.Im not sure what you mean by TAB to cycle through the match list you can bind any key to anything. I think I agree with you if youre referring to the default helm bindings. I found the defaults to be a little odd so I ended up swapping TAB with MTAB and Cz with TAB    definekey helmmap kbd Ci helmexecutepersistentaction    definekey helmmap kbd CMi helmselectactionThis lets me press TAB to select something rather than Cz which I find fairly uncomfortable and jarring. After switching these keys around selecting completions feels very much like using the completions in zsh letting me use the muscle memory Ive built up around it.Actions are as useful as you make them. They will make a little more sense after using helm for a day or two.Heavyweight? Perhaps although helms core is about the same number of lines as idos. The author is working on splitting up the monolithic helm package into pieces. Intrusive? Yes I can understand how you would see it that way. But it will save your window configuration correctly in every case that Ive seen so its more like a popup. I can see how that would be distracting and disconcerting.As for ido on its own and as for its aesthetic it is definitely more minimalistic. But as for speed from my experience so far I would argue that helm is much faster for larger completion lists. Once you set    setq helmquickupdate t          helmidledelay .          helminputidledelay .helm gets pretty damn snappy. As for practicality Im not willing to argue on that point as I feel that its in the eye of the beholder. What eventually sold me on helm was realizing that I had a whole stack of things ido idovertical flxido eproject magit hacked together to complete various things but helm did them all already and better with the possible exception of flxido in certain completion corner cases. One example of something helm does objectively better is buffer switching. In helm with certain prefixes to match parameters I can match against buffer names with no prefix buffer modes with a  prefix and buffer contents with a  prefix to switch quickly between buffers. This is all done with one dwim command vs the combination of multioccur rgrep and switchtobuffer that I was using before.Again I would encourage you to give it a fair shot if only to spark ideas about more ways you can use ido but you should use what you feel is most efficient for you.,emacs,cfc976n,1,t5_2qhwu
428898,0,t3_1yzk6n,Thanks for the question Im also very curious about other peoples work flow using Emacs. Considering Emacss serverclient is something like Tmuxs session and its able to keep longrunning process in Emacs shell I had tried to use Emacs for most shelling. But finally I gave up Sometimes Emacs hangs and has to be killed then all buffersshell process in Emacs gone.  Sometimes I need to restart Emacs server. So currently I think Emacs shell is not suit for longrunning shell progress. Im so frustrated about this. My current work flow is using Tmux for shelling and using Emacs for any editing. This article inspired me a lot I have following settings in .tmux.conf        bindkey y   newwindow a n emacs  em    bindkey Cy splitwindow emem is a wrapper for emacsclient     emacsclient a  t My tmux prefix key is C .

779261,0,t3_2328s3,Yes the package list uses tabulatedlistmode this displays the header line using the magic headerlineformat variable which is like a topofthewindow version of modelineformat. The exact same variable is used by packages providing tab interfaces.Youre not going to like this answer but my suggestion would be to learn to live without tabs. You shouldnt be clicking between tabs anyway and emacs buffers are logically stacked in such a way that you can flip between them easily with the builtin commands. Turn on idomode and idoeverywhere and use that to switch between your working buffers. And if you like to see groups of related buffers pop into ibuffer perhaps combined with something like my ibuffervc addon which groups buffers by version control project.,emacs,cgsutps,2,t5_2qhwu

The Orgrelated packages on MELPA are rd party packages.gt For anyone who contributes to Emacs core it would be great if package authors could tell package.el that certain files are optional and can be skipped if they fail to compile.Byte compilation is already optional by design.

1358174,0,t1_cim2ryh,I think that you are confusing the magic autoload cookies and autoloads.An autoload is created with the autoload function.  An autoload for game would look like this    autoload game  The docstring t nilIf this expression is evaluated it tells Emacs to automatically load .el when the function game is called with no definition of that function yet available.  You can add such autoloads to your init.el yourself to autoload rd party libraries.  In the old days before package.el this was very common.Note that this expression really needs to be evaluated that is Emacs must load a file which contains this expression.  Obviously it doesnt make any sense to put autoloads into the very file that contains the definition  By the time Emacs sees the autoload it already sees the definition as well and the entire rest of the file leading the purpose of autoloads ad absurdum.Hence for autoloads to make sense they must be in a separate file that only contains autoloads and little else so that it loads fast.  However maintaining a separate file of autoloads and keeping it in sync with the real definition is tiresome and errorprone.Hence Emacs provides updatedirectoryautoloads and updatefileautoloads to automatically generate these autoload files by inspecting special comments i.e. the autoload cookies autoload.  But these commands only generate the autoload files they do not load them.  Hence after calling updatedirectoryautoloads you end up with an autoloads file in the current directory but no autoloads are actually added.  You need to explicitly load this file to make the autoloads available.Maintaining autoloads manually this way is still errorprone hence package.el automates this by automatically generating autoload files upon installing packages and automatically loading the autoload files of installed packages.You can see this in action yourself  Just take a look at the package directories in .emacs.delpa.  Every package has an autoload file inside e.g. .emacs.delpaadaptivewrap.adaptivewrapautoloads.el.  In packageinitialize Emacs goes through all of these files and loads them to establish autoloads.  If you remove any such file the corresponding package wont be autoloaded anymore.I hope this clarifies the way autoloads works and unveils the mysteries around them.,emacs,cimjcr3,2,t5_2qhwu

1502337,0,t1_cj41ksk,I am currently writing an Org tutorial for beginners free under the GNU FDL in which I will cover this variable in details so I will paste what I have written so far about this.First you have to understand the structure of this powerful variable    key  description  type amp match  settings  filesA basic example    setq orgagendacustomcommands            w My WAITING tasks todo WAITINGSo w is the key My WAITING tasks is the description todo is the type of filtering you want WAITING is the matchSo by pressing w you will produce a single todo view listing all your WAITING tasks. Fine. You can also add settings like I said above as a list of lists just after the match like this    setq orgagendacustomcommands          w My WAITING tasks todo WAITING         orgagendaoverridingheader Tasks waiting for somethingIn this list of lists every list will be like a let form assigning a value to a variable. Here the value Tasks waiting for something is assigned to the orgagendaoverridingheader variable.  So the title of your view will be changed to that string. Try it!Now since the structure of the orgagendacustomcommands variable is a list of lists you can add multiple views like this        setq orgagendacustomcommands          w My WAITING tasks todo WAITING             orgagendaoverridingheader Tasks waiting for something            x My agenda view agenda              orgagendaspan dayHere pressing w will produce the previous view but x will produce another view an agenda view. This agenda view will span a single day since the settings part assign the variable orgagendaspan to the value day. Keep adding lists to this list of lists to produce other views.But you can also with a single key produce multiple views called blocks. In the code this will be reflected by including a list of lists inside one of your views like this    setq orgagendacustomcommands          y A view with multiple blocks             todo WAITING            orgagendaoverridingheader Tasks waiting for something          agenda               orgagendaspan dayHere by adding a list of lists you combined the two previous views in one single view but with two blocks. So here we have y as your key A view with multiple blocks as your description a list of lists for customizing blocks every list inside this list of lists will have the form type  match  settings  files as soon as we quit this list of lists we go back into the parent key  description  type  match  settings  files structure and so we can add other settings that will be applied to every single block.Let me give an example lets say we only want to see entries with the home tag in the previous view. We dont have to specify it in the individual blocks we can add it in the settings part of the view as a list of lists this doesnt change! like this    setq orgagendacustomcommands          y A view with multiple blocks          todo WAITING             orgagendaoverridingheader Tasks waiting for something           agenda                orgagendaspan day          orgagendatagfilterpreset homeThis single view is composed of two blocks one displaying a todo list of WAITING tasks with a custom title and the other displaying an agenda view spanning a single day. All these blocks will filter any entries that dont have a home tag.Now the most difficult part  Lets say we want to add a block which will list all upcoming deadlines. We have to set the variable orgagendaskipfunction to a function that will ignore all entries that are not deadline. We will call this function btxorgagendaskipnotdeadline. The code in orgagendacustomcommands will look like this    setq orgagendacustomcommands          y A view with multiple blocks         todo WAITING            orgagendaoverridingheader Tasks waiting for something          agenda               orgagendaspan day          todo             orgagendaskipfunction btxorgagendaskipnotdeadline             orgagendaoverridingheader Upcoming deadlines             orgagendatagfilterpreset home Now we need to define the btxorgagendaskipnotdeadline function so it will ignore every entry that is not a deadline. This could look like this    defun btxorgagendaskipnotdeadline       Skip items that are not deadlines.      let dl orgentryget nil DEADLINE        if or not dl            equal dl         progn outlinenextheading pointIf the DEADLINE property doesnt exist or is the empty string skip the subtree and go to the next heading.So this view will produce a new block called Upcoming deadlines that will list all entries that are upcoming deadlines with the tag home.,emacs,cj4lb35,3,t5_2qhwu

2359465,0,t1_cm38chv,If your day session includes using every library that you make any use of then this is fine and theres no waste...and further with  days of uptime anything you dont use will likely be swapped out anyway.  So your own use of require may work just fine for you.But in my own workflow I usually start a fresh session daily...for a variety of reasons that mostly boil down to a history of wellearned paranoia about memory leaks andor the reliability of various external services sometimes on other hosts...and there are many packages that I do not use on a daily basis but do make use of on occasion.  And though the hit of loading these is as you point out quite comparatively small it still represents taking more resources than you need or actually require heh. And as I also have occasion to run emacs with the same or similar configuration on shared hosts i.e. not my own personal desktop where wasting resources may impact other peoples processes using autoload can also be seen as a measure of politeness and not just one of frugality or tidiness.Anyway my point here is just that while using require for everything may work just fine for you and your workflow there are some good reasons for other folks to utilize autoload.  Perhaps your own workflow wouldnt see any advantages from it but there are definitely real situations which would.  Not to mention older hardware embedded systems or other resourceconstrained environments.And regardless autoload is good to know about in case you ever find yourself in a situation where you need it.,emacs,cm3c9p5,4,t5_2qhwu

2491971,0,t3_2o4x49,Ive been using emacs for java recently so here are some thoughts Standard autocomplete works suprisingly well. Obviously it wont give you a list of applicable functions to choose like an IDE from but it will save you a lot of typing and its much faster than eclim. Yasnippet is as handy as ever Grep searchreplace and ctags combined with projectile are almost as good as the findsymbolreferences findsymboldeclaration and renamesymbol features that you get with an IDE. However ctags in particular falls over when faced with functions of the same name in different places. Since almost all Java classes are in files with the same name projectilefindfile combined with ido is very nice for finding a given class. ant or probably maven etc if you prefer combined with compile works pretty well for compilation and testing.The annoyance that I have at the moment is import statements. I believe eclipse can automatically keep import statements uptodate but I havent found a way to do this in emacs yet.,emacs,cmju719,6,t5_2qhwu

2811224,0,t3_2s9wxw,Why should it?  Neither of these features is a particularly good fit for Emacs Lisp.  Basically Emacs Lisp lacks the entire infrastructure to support these features  Its dynamically typed dynamically bound and impure whereas TCO and lazy evaluation in particular play best with languages that are statically typed statically bound and pure.Lazy evaluation specifically does not work well with impure languages particularly languages with global dynamic bindings such as Emacs Lisp.  In such languages you cannot accurately predict side effects and global state of a program under lazy evaluation since you dont know when a thunk will eventually be evaluated and how the global state would look like by then with obvious implications for understanding and debugging a program.For instance what if a lazy thunk would accidentally escape a let binding for a dynamic variable used in the body of the thunk?  Youd have a very hard time to figure out why the code suddenly uses the wrong value of the variable.Besides lazy evaluation has its own problems  Its easy to mess up memory use with lazy evaluation and debugging space leaks takes time and requires good tool support.  Since most Emacs Lisp is written by developers which dont use Emacs Lisp as their primiary language its probably not a good idea to introduce this complexity into the language.Tail call optimization would be easier but it is probably not worth the effort.  Emacs cant completely ellide function calls anyway since function definitions are bound dynamically and can thus change in between two calls.  IOW it cannot turn tail recursion into a loop and only do a limited form of TCO which just throws away older stack frames.Hence the overhead of function calls would stay.  Youd only save some stack frames which allows for larger recursion but doesnt make code run faster.  But if you are at a risk of running into the recursion limit you could always just write the loop yourself right away.  And in fact most Emacs Lisp code is written in this way anyway so tail call optimization wouldnt solve any important problem.In the end Emacs Lisp is simply an imperative language.  It prefers loops over recursion and relies on strict evaluation.  Its not a functional language and it never will be for good or for bad.,emacs,cnnmls7,8,t5_2qhwu

I think editing is really just back and forth between insert and normal modes. So Im curious what usecase youre talking about.To answer you question though I have no problem jumping between vim and emacs commands regardless of mode. Navigation and editing e.g. movement and operator combos can be handled with vimevil. Then switch to emacs for more complex things like setting up orgtimers or evaluating the buffer. Anything in between like saving a file is up in the air. You can use either w or Cx Cs. Both work and there is no compatibility with evilmode right out of the box.

Video demonstration here  It provides the plumbing to handle multiple views of one buffer with an automatic translation between them the main example is literate programming where one view is the org file with source blocks and the other is the tangled source with the org text in comments.  I bet you could tweak that accordingly for Fountain without too much effort.,emacs,crsttzf,2,t5_2qhwu
4171716,0,t1_crvfmrr,gt TBH I havent really liked much of the Emacs docs I personally preferred the VIm ones I know its not official VIm documentation but Im yet to find something for Emacs thats anywhere near Steve Loshes Learn Vim Script the Hard Way.For learning Emacs  seems pretty good. Personally I used the builtin Emacs tutorial. I also cant emphasize enough that Emacs has by far the best online help system of any program I know of. What do I mean by online? I dont mean on the Internet I mean that within Emacs in any buffer in any mode you can get help for anything you need without leaving the editor. Ch Ck will prompt for a keystroke and tell you what command if any is bound to it show documentation for that command and offer links to its definition. Ch v will prompt for a variable name often prefilled with the variable youre interested in like magic and show the documentation for it along with links to the definition. The same goes for Ch f functioncommand documentation Ch m modes active in the current buffer and a whole bunch others all listed under Ch Ch.That feature is singularly responsible for bringing me back from the allure of vim and modal editing time and time again by comparison vims h help system and remembering what you have to quote and what not and what prefixes you have to shove before things is a joke.As for learning Emacs Lisp which would be equivalent to learning Vimscript I agree there isnt a very good getting started guide to learning the language and the included packages. But if you already know Scheme or Common Lisp or Clojure much of it will be familiar to you.,emacs,crvs76n,3,t5_2qhwu

Random hangs with CPU spiking to  when using loads of remote buffers. I just didnt have enough time to figure out why. . Evil mode.  It is superb. It has tons of features I used a lot multiedit of search occurrences and many more. In addition modal editing did feel much superior the navigation and text manipulation was fluid and easily memorized. Having said that evil doesnt work for all buffers that well. Sometimes in dired magit youd have to use emacs keybindings for navigation and it breaks consistency.I will be back to spacemacs when its a bit more polished.

When you press the special Action Key on an identifier Hyperbole searches up the directory tree of the current file finds the first matching TAGS file and uses it to jump to the definition of the identifier.  If xref.el is in use it uses that as well all transparently.  It also does this with Java documentation crossrefs and many other similar implicit links.,emacs,d6lthyo,1,t5_2qhwu

10065998,0,t3_5jkgz2,Let me plug my rjsx mode here. Its an extension to jsjsx so you can use the parser and relating tooling but you get nice highlighting.That said the indentation in jsmode and jsmode is the same. Your issues with the sgml offset might be because youre using setqdefault in a modehook where youd just want to use setq.There are a couple more issues to watch out for. Indentation code uses heurestics to guess whether to use sgml or js usually this just means you have to wrap multiline JSX in parens if theyre not already. Also there is a known bug when indenting JSX code that includes fat arrow gt functions in attributes.,emacs,dbjmfei,2,t5_2qhwu

My opinion is that ripgrep does not do the reasonable thing but thats me.  I guess you will need to use positionbytes or maybe stringbytes in some place to convert character positions to byte positions.  This will generally work if ripgrep outputs UTF encoding if it uses some other encoding the plot thickens and you will have to call length on the text after encoding it.,emacs,dc0xkb3,2,t5_2qhwu

10256505,0,t3_5mu9n3,i highly recommend Gergely Nagys stuff. Check out his latest blog though i think few things am not sure its utmost optimal for everybody.for example the tab dance keys. one might call it multichar key instead. When you press key once it insert one char say the left paren press it twice it inserts another say the left square bracket press it  times it insert left curly bracket braces. As far as i know he has  tab dance keys for inserting the left and right of the  types of brackets  for me i think thats not optimal. I think the most efficient way to insert brackets pair say the parenthesis is to press a key and both opening and closing are inserted with cursor moved to the middle.this brings us to another issue is that i find not all operations can be optimally done on keyboard firmware. The inserting brackets by pair is a example. For example suppose there is a text selection then you press the insert bracket pairs key. Here i think best behavior is for brackets to be placed around the selected text. So this cannot be done with keyboard firmware itself. This goal must be done in conjunction with an editorOS. or perhaps in the coming future the keyboard hardware can actually communicate with OS in both directions more than just transmitting keys.The above is one example.I recently chatted with him and we havent discussed this idea yet.there are more details about the brackets insertion. For example keyboards dont have the luxury of having  or  physical keys dedicated to just the  types of brackets. on traditional PC keyboard  physical keys are dedicated for brackets with help of Shift to type the  ascii bracket chars. On fancy ergonomics keyboard usually they are matrix layout and sacrifice the sundry extra pinky keys on the far right of keyboard so even fewer keys. So when we consider keyspots we may not have the luxury to have  or  or more dedicated keys for brackets. We must resort to other means such as tab dance with shift or with leader key or layer. Which way is most optimal. Then if we have nice system to insert brackets one starts to also want the same way to insert curly quotes and single curly french single and other unicode brackets chinesejapanese  math floor  math ceiling . This is a reason am not a big fan for tab dance key for brackets.edited extended,emacs,dc6mq5q,3,t5_2qhwu

I myself use usepackage but I also to orgmode for my init files and I havent figured out how to use both effectively.  Meaning Ill use usepackage to install the package but I cant really put configuring stuff in usepackage configure  section.Also the only other editor that is faster than emacs at startup is probably vim.

10683839,0,t1_ddhvypr,Ok to clarify what I mean by filter compare helmag to egrep.egrep in emacs would open a separate window for the results. You can do Isearch to highlight more search terms like for example files that has projx name in them. then you could still click on these search results where the Isearch hit to go to that file.In helmag I would like to further filter the results which were based on pattern but independently. Not sure if that is clear enough.Basically I would like to have helmag act exactly like a egrep results window but then you might ask well just use egrep then. I still like helmag interactive results showing as soon as I start typing...etc,emacs,ddhygu0,1,t5_2qhwu

10724818,0,t1_ddm3543,should be pretty easy to create a new layout.just copy this xahdvoraktoqwertykmap and create a xahdvoraktocolmakkmap for example. Its just a map of letters.then copy the xahdvoraktoqwerty and modifie it to xahdvoraktocolmak. Basically just change  line to use xahdvoraktocolmakkmap.then add a line to xahflykeychar so it knows what to do when xahflykeycurrentlayout is equal to colmak.that should be it. Then in the init    xahflykeyssetlayout colemakThe bulk of change is the essential map of letters of the new layout. Though right now one still need to modify a few functions as described above. The code could use improvement so its more general and systimatic. If you do it and pull request id add it in.Id add in colmak but right now am thinking i dont want it to become big supporting lots layouts. Just qwerty dvorak colmak. I think its simpler for people to mod their own copy and create French German programers dovrak etc layouts.,emacs,ddm6ofz,1,t5_2qhwu

I dont like to let Emacs write in my init file so that was not the reason but I will do change customfile. In my mind the original init.el file was just a preliminary step before loading the real config and somehow I wanted Emacs to be as blind as possible to it.

11496117,0,t1_dfz1xx2,I dont think the burden on MELPA maintainers would be much more once the code is written.  It could be nearly automated for new packages something like putting the key IDfingerprint in the recipe file.  Updates to recipes happen from time to time already.gt Deciding for the users which keys should be trusted is a responsibility I wouldnt like to have. Theyre already deciding for the users which packages and package authors should be trusted.  Once a packages recipe is added any author can push any malicious version and it will automatically be built and distributed to users.  Nothing changes in this respect except that signed tags protect against MITM attacks between MELPA and the git repos it pulls from.Yeah a lot of package authors are lazyfrom looking at the code submitted in new packages I would estimate the vast majority are.  But I dont think we should let that stop us.  As a user I want to be able to only install signed authenticated packages by default and manually approve unsigned packages and upgrades when I absolutely need a package that isnt signed.How does Borg guarantee anything?  If Borg pulls a package from GitHub over TLS how is that any different from MELPA pulling the package from GitHub over TLS and then sending you the package over TLS?  All youre doing is cutting out MELPA as a middleman which protects against MELPA itself being compromised but in no way guarantees the authenticity of the packages.,emacs,dfz31gf,1,t5_2qhwu

11516420,0,t1_dg0etb0,The biggest flaw is the thumb keys. I find them to be pretty useless apart from the closest one. I tried putting Alt on the second thumb key for a while and it was impossible to use comfortably because it is just too much of a stretch. I have  and Del on the second thumb keys now and still struggle with them but I ran out of good spots for these keys. The remaining thumb keys the smaller ones are beyond useless. I have larger than average hands.My other issues are due to the firmware more than the keyboard itself. Dualfunction keys are not very useful due to the lag issue I mentioned  maybe some wouldnt mind the latency but it is highly noticeable for me imagine a delay every single time you press enter for example.Other issues are things like the keyboard freezing if you hold too many modifiers at once can be fixed by plugging out and back in but annoying the backslash key occasionally either not working or sending two signals awful for typing in something like Latex I imagine and a terrible online configurator super slow took me all day to make my triplelayer setup the first time around and making minor changes is still a chore. Doesnt help that its buggy and tends to freeze and saving takes a long time.I mean the keyboard is definitely usable but it took about a month for me to get to that level with it. I am able to avoid all of its shortcomings now apart from the backslash thing... I am definitely sold on the merits of mechanical ergonomic keyboards but wish Id chosen something else. Strange that this keyboard got such rave reviews.,emacs,dg1dyvk,2,t5_2qhwu
