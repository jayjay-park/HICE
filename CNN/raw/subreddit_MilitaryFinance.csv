1720985,0,t3_2dhens,Prior to the crash I flipped two houses.  The  crash happened while I was still fixing the third up so I ended up turning it into a rental.  I still have it as a rental but I honestly couldnt tell you if I ever made it into the black or not after the wash I took fixing countless repairs. Personally I trust paper assets more but YMMV.  Whats important is that you dont put all your eggs in any one basket.,MilitaryFinance,cjw3dt3,1,t5_2uhjq

Been doing this for over  years. They have always gotten me my stuff. License is not FL so cant help you there. ,MilitaryFinance,d0y2tb7,1,t5_2uhjq

8003781,0,t3_4ousos,Obviously start contributing to the TSP if you havent already.  I would open an online brokerage account.  But please for your sake research and read as much as you can about investing before putting any money into something.  I highly recommend reading The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.  It teaches many valuable lessons.  ,MilitaryFinance,d4fp8i7,5,t5_2uhjq

9221600,0,t3_4w1g7d,This is a very good question.From my understanding no. I helped a buddy of mine to file taxes. His home city charged local taxes. Since he technically didnt reside in the city he didnt have to. So I changed up his address. He still paid state taxes but not city taxes.Thats like New York City charging you city tax but you didnt reside nor work there. Now could the city enforce it? Of course. But from my understanding only the state income tax can be enforced amp will be enforced by DFAS.,MilitaryFinance,d8kwlzb,1,t5_2uhjq

9270421,0,t3_4uiwh7,Jasper  Great excel worksheet!  I was looking to make one but the task of getting all the military pay charts in there was not something I was looking forward to.  I took yours and edited it a bit and Im trying to find a way to post it here like you did to share it back.  One note so you know in your formula to calculate how much the GOV contributes if the Soldier contributes  you have an error in your formula that has the GOV match at  instead of   You missed a zero.  Check it out and youll see what I mean.  Anyways great work and if I can figure out how to post I will share what Ive got.  ,MilitaryFinance,d8r3cm6,1,t5_2uhjq

10663593,0,t3_5sh7q1,First congrats on having such a high savings rate.  is impressive. If I were in your shoes I would lower my contributions to TSP for the time being and start throwing money at my student loan debt.  Since you had the debt before you got in you might be able to reduce the interest rate with the SCRA.  Your debt is an absolute emergency because any returns you are seeing on your TSP are being negated by the interest rates of your loan.  I wouldnt open a Vanguard account until you have maxed your TSP contributions for  .  Which at  shouldnt be hard to do. Once again AFTER you have paid off your student loans. Once debt is paid off and you have maxed your TSP contributions for the year then open a Vanguard IRA and max that . Then if you have any left over open a taxable account and basically use it as a savings account.  Dont forget to have an emergency fund to cover immediate unforeseen expenses.  That amount can be whatever you want it to be but for a single E with no kids it shouldnt be much. For comparison Im a married E no kids  paidoff cars and I dont keep more than  in my emergency fund. And thats only because Im overseas and might need to book an emergency flight home one day for myself and my wife.  Even then I would use my credit card to purchase the tickets then immediately pay it off with my emergency fund.So to recap...Build a small emergency fund maybe only k for you.Stop contributing so much to TSP right now and use that money to pay down your debt as fast as possible.  I suggest reading Military Money Manual and how he paid off over k in student loans.Once loans are paid off.. Go back to contributing to TSP until it is maxed.Once TSP is maxed open a Vanguard IRA and contribute the max to that. Once IRA is maxed open a Vanguard taxable account and contribute as much as you can.Once youve done all that then maybe you can gamble in Bitcoin or whatever the other guy suggested.Good luck. ,MilitaryFinance,ddfv9n0,3,t5_2uhjq

10857296,0,t3_5so4sd,If you have not joined yet and have decent credit I suggest you run over to the Chase website and apply for the Chase Reserve Card it is a tremendous credit card with great benefits but costs  dollars a year to have the trick is that they waive the fee for people who hold the card BEFORE they join. So if you are joining this month you could potentially get the card join and have the fee waived for however many years as you are in the military. Talking about  dollars on travel fees free each year free access to lounges great point earning and mile redemption etc. ,MilitaryFinance,ddzuqi2,1,t5_2uhjq
10976913,0,t3_5wlzvp,gtI am wondering what will happen to my SGLI state Tax. If it becomes ve balance do i need to pay out of my pocket?It wont become a negative balance. If there arent enough funds to contribute  of your pay to the TSP after all your deductions have been made no pay will be contributed to the TSP and you will receive an error on your LES explaining this. All of the money will instead go to the bank you have setup for direct deposits.To make sure that income tax isnt an issue for this you can up your withholding in MyPay and just lower them from your civilian work to even it out or pay quarterly estimated tax payments.Because the percentage calculates based on your beforetax base pay in order to contribute  to your Roth TSP you cannot have any deductions and your withholdings have to be high enough so no Federal or State tax are taken out of your pay otherwise you wont have  of your base pay left and youll receive an error.Heres a post I made back in January when I was setting up my Roth TSP and I ran into this issue.,MilitaryFinance,dec7uk7,1,t5_2uhjq

11084672,0,t3_5ya8yc,You will not have to pay PA tax for your civilian pay from AugustDecember.State tax is owed to the state in which it is earned.  In this case you have to pay New Jersey for the income earned in that state.  PA does not have any claim on it.  This come up often in people that live in one state and work in another the have to pay in the state in which they work.As to your AD pay I dont know.  ,MilitaryFinance,deofrsq,3,t5_2uhjq
11304618,0,t3_61bfmd,In terms of investing you cant go wrong with TSP especially with the BRS match of  base staring in . I am going for it because I am not sure about making  years! This is the only investment vehicle cheaper than vanguard and schwab at  cents per  where USAA charges more. If you want to invest put in  of your base every month and boom  return with BRS!,MilitaryFinance,dfdd0xi,2,t5_2uhjq
