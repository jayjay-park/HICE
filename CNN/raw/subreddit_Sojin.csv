2606560,0,t1_cmyqcph,My point is that to call culturally significant dresswear always unflattering is pretty damn offensive and stupid. Also I never said that everyone has to like it so I dont know why you are even responding with that.Plus wearing a hanbok isnt meant to be flattering. It is to show that they are still in touch with their countrys history and traditions not to turn other people on.,Sojin,cmytcg8,4,t5_2xkeb
