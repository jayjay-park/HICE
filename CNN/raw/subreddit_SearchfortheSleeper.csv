5260811,0,t3_3n1w6g,Im working off what Ive read here already so apologies anybody if Ive misunderstood or missed something  CHLM likely refers to Charlemagne the warmind on Mars that never made the final cut of the game. The reference showed up again somewhere in TTK so its got everybody digging for clues on it. It implies the Warminds are linked so if something happens to one the other retaliates or prepares to defend itself etc in my opinion at least.I like the idea of trying to make Rasputin think youre a threat in order to get it to reveal the weapon. Not sure what adds it COULD spawn though surely it has no control over Fallen Hive or Vex? Unless its somehow harnessed the power of the Vex seeing as its more intelligent. As you say it could be that the starting point of this or at least somewhere near the start will be having to make Rasputin believe the threat criteria has been met which will in turn open up a new area or trigger the next set of steps. ,SearchfortheSleeper,cvk4kwq,2,t5_3a0kh

5321505,0,t3_3nwaih,Im with you. Ive been supporting this game since the first day I have played. Now Bungie is making decisions that really frustrate me. Putting some weapons behind a timegate.. thats understandable but the Sleeper? Couldnt they have just said in time the weapon will show itself? Ive been sitting here daily looking into this puzzle like a detective thanks a lot Bungie. I wasnt even worried about the weapon I just wanted to be around when the discovery was made.Now to top things off Bungie has announced microtransactions. While they may be just cosmetic its a bad route to begin taking and seriously couldnt have been given as news at such a bad time. ,SearchfortheSleeper,cvrvuqc,3,t5_3a0kh

What they did was let people camp in a forest searching for the prey only to release the prey in the wild after a month by sending up a huge flare showing where its position is.
