2310664,0,t3_2lpo36,Really liking the fact that the backstory to the world is not for a while into the book. Its like a realization of epic magnitude. Like a kid realizing the meaning of life when they become an adult. Great job on that fringly,fringly,clxbb71,2,t5_33k3a

3018262,0,t3_2uoaz9,Im starting to wish the first person narration was from Mais perspective. Ever since Alex and Mai split up in the beginning of the story shes been the more interesting character. ,fringly,coau9mf,3,t5_33k3a

6558266,0,t1_czxjeq2,Thatd be a good name for the story now but if this ever became a book I think it would be better not to give that away in the title as it was a twist that didnt appear until the secondthird part. Maybe something like The Justice Crew or simply The Crew. Alternatively we could vaguely allude to the MCs monsterism and call it Monster or something along those lines,fringly,czxog7u,4,t5_33k3a

6797237,0,t1_d0mqwyf,I sometimes get a little caught up in his emotional state and I have to take a few mins to remind myself that its not me thats all messed up. Although that is what they would want me to think... looks around panickily  ,fringly,d0mrb7w,13,t5_33k3a

7486475,0,t3_4hx9v7,If theres not going to be much of a future anyways. I wonder why Galactico would continue to fight against Steve and Co. Could the advisors have a deal in place to take a select few..ie Steves  dad Galactico from Earth when it all ends.,fringly,d2t66s6,3,t5_33k3a

7709338,0,t3_4kwkmo,I guess Galactigo really wants to be the one to kill Steve. It sucks that Steve was so easily manipulated. Silly Steve. These advisors can stuff it. Also why go for Steve unless he has the ability to rip them out somehow and put them back into hell where they belong.,fringly,d3ii0mk,3,t5_33k3a
