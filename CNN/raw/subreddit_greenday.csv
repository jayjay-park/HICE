81223,0,t3_1uzwks,The videos have very simillar themes but I feel like Walking Contradictions is more about not noticing or not caring about the things that happen around you while Warnings is more about not following the very basic safety warnings. Thats why each video suits each song better. Walking Contradiction is about not caring about the standarts around you while Warning is about the stupidity of constant safety warnings... Basically the video is showing that its obvious nobody does what that guy does we know its dangerous so we dont need constant warnings about it.Thats at least how I feel about it,greenday,cenocq2,6,t5_2snhx

We found a small electric at a yard sale one day and he loved it then for christmas last year his grandparents bought him an actual acoustic guitar and we started lessons.  He started in December taking an hour long lesson a week. His instructor says he has an ear for it. He will listen process it and then play it back. He sits and watches youtube videos and can easily mimic what they do. He is learning to read music. I myself have no music abilities whatsoever. So I honestly dont know what tabs are! Im sure he does! His uncle who lives  hours from us saw his video went out and bought him a new electric. The place he takes lessons actually wants him to start on other instruments also.

3287286,0,t3_2xse29,I didnt become a fan till bout a year and a half ago and I hated the band when American idiot came out was  and stupid and into country at the time so perhaps I can offer a different perspective. To preface it again Im . Became a fan of the band Septemberish of . Since then Ive bought all the albums and listened to them and all that jazz. Imo it all boils down to when you became a fan of the band. Same applies to another band I love KISS. If you grew up with Dookie era green day odds are THATS your favorite era. If you grew up on American idiot era green day odds are thats your favorite era. Me personally if I had to pick id go with s green day. American idiot is my all time favorite album from any band. From what Ive gathered green day ha always had amazing vocals but I feel AI really drove home the beautiful harmonies and background vocals. As did st. Being in choir all through high school that hits close to home for me. I was too young to understand all that was going in when AI came out so the political meanings dont hit as close to home but I understand and agree with a lot of it. And if I had to rank the albums and this order changes from time to time but as of this moment itd be AIgt nimrodgt stgt dookiegt warninggt unogt insomniacgt tregt dos gt kerplunkpre dookie songs. And the honest reason for pre dookie being that low is because of the recording quality. The songs themselves I do like but the low quality recordings Im not a fan of.

Theres no knowing what happens to JOS or how he lives without her. And I do not think Homecoming is a good last song either. Its just a climax. We know what happens to JOS and how he kills Jimmy and goes back home but its just not finished. Whatsername is the perfect ending. We learn how mature JOS has gotten and I think thats the point of the album. The whole album JOS wants to find himself and he thinks hes misunderstood but he finally goes up and we see that the whole story is just one long retelling of this wonderful story. The moment he remembers Whatsername is the second he grows up. Thats the beauty of it and I dont think there is a better song to end the album. ,greenday,cr3svx8,1,t5_2snhx

Its got a great build up the main part rocks. then it switches to this new movement. I dont know what its called but its got a kinda swinging rhythm to it like Longviews chorus you know? Like a du dudu dudu dudu. I dont know how to describe it...Not to mention that fast little guitar riff is one of Billies best riffs! And then next parts bridge? are afuckingmazing! The melody keeps changing its got some heys! in there and then it crashes into this slow smooth bendy solo. Then next part is this somber low kind of eulogy feeling verse. It feels like end of days. And the way it end kind of feels like the music circles down the drain into nothing and all you hear at the very end is BJs vocals. Fucking amazing. It gives me chills  of the time every time.

4253393,0,t3_39ngc7,Pros of really old Green Day Very creative but in a less artsy way and a more this is punk we can do whatever we want way.  Cons Bad mixing John Kiffmeyer is not a very consistent drummer.  Seriously the end of At The Library is like twice as fast as the beginning.Pros of kind of old Green Day Kerplunk Dookie Insomniac Amazing songs very tight production lots of energy relatable lyrics.  Cons Some of the songs get a little samey especially when they would just play an instrumental verse instead of a separate bridge on Insomniac.Pros of midrange Green Day Nimrod to CB More experimental very good production more mature lyrical topics.  Cons Sometimes the experimentation doesnt work and sometimes Billie Joes attempts to cover certain lyrical topics dont quite come off as smoothly as they should.Pros of the Trilogy I might get some hate for this but I seriously think the Trilogy was just a complete step backwards for Green Day and in the wrong way.  They tried to simplify and regain energy and it made everything just seem immature boring and desperate.  Also the production is terrible.  All the guitars and vocals sound like crap.  The only pro I can think of is that they at least tried to recapture their old sound but they made so many mistakes in the execution that I cant give them any points on the merit of their songwriting lyrics or mixingmastering.,greenday,cs52o1h,7,t5_2snhx

I will say that if you can draw get your idea out on paper set it up how you want it and then go to your tattoo artist. You can either tell him or her Thats how I want it I just need you to touch it up make it look neat. or This is an idea of what I want feel free to play with it but just keep the general idea. Tattoo artists love when you talk to them about the idea it gives them an idea of what youre working with especially when you grant them a little bit of freedom to work with their talents and make a better overall tattoo.,greenday,ct7tx4f,2,t5_2snhx

By the way Warning is one of if not my favorite album of theirs at times. I kind of see it musically as their White Album I do have a question for you.

9041661,0,t3_540d66,GD fan for nearly  years have listened to almost everything every album s of live shows bootlegs and videos.The Poppyness in their music has me half and half sometimes I do stress sometimes but something about this song strikes a different chord for me.My reaction to this was a complete mess for me. I was caught completely offguard in the middle of filling out applications for jobs that I had to walk to get. I had logged on FB to ask for a few refs from my parents and it was uploaded on GDs FB  minutes earlier. I dropped everything I was doing literally dropped a stack of papers and books and played the video. The initial visuals had me so confused yet engaged. I didnt know if this would be a good song until I heard Im still alive.Everything just moved with the song at that point I found myself filled with joy then the chorus hit me. The power in Billys vocals and the melody was something so incredible the first time. It was something beyond happy.It really started to bring out emotions with the second set of lyrics in the verse. I could recall a lot of my old friends doing drugs when I was young and the three times I did as well and a few disappearing with divorces. And throughout the last  years I lost  family members moved  times both sides of my family go estranged and my relationship going through the homophobia which we continue to deal with. So many things going wrong with  feeling like the bottom of the pit.The bridge really hit it for me. Are you scared to death to live? Ive never really thought about this kind of question before. After moving so many times hearing Just to find a home thats for the restlessand the truth thats in the message. hit me harder with the quiet guitar following after.The last chorus brought me to a few tears. I know these past few years and especially this one has been some of the most painful ones. Not for me but for a lot of people everywhere. With the election homophobia racism shootings bombings religion and war I see it every day now be it from the news sites on paper or even my friends going on about it all day. Its something that sucks the life out of many every day and now the last chorus has something else to it this time.Cause Im still breathingCause Im still breathing on my ownMy heads above the rain and rosesMaking my way awayMy way to youI felt like Billy was talking about not only himself but everyone listening too. Were all still breathing. Throughout all the BS weve been through were still here. Making our way throughout it all. Be it for something somewhere or for someone.I love this song so much now and have listened to it nonstop since it dropped.Pardon me now as I pick up everything I dropped.,greenday,d7ynw1o,9,t5_2snhx

Still dont have a ticket but what I have gathered is thisThe way it works is there arent really physical tickets. When you buy your ticket they use your credit card. So when you go to the venue they scan your actual card and check your ID so you have to have thoseFrom third party sites you can buy your ticket but theyll send you one of those pre paid Visa cards in the mail. Your supposed to use this card as your way in.From looking around it says that people with this pre paid card have been getting turned down at the venue the day of the show. Some people have missed the show. But they say that if enough people complain theyll let the pre paid card people in. I think it gets easier and easier. Anyway thats all I got.I wanna get one of those pre paid card things but my obstacle is that they only sell tickets in pairs now and I only need one,greenday,d87tzmf,2,t5_2snhx

9764424,0,t3_5f1amv,I think the reason Nimrod is one of Green Days best albums in my opinion is the fact they experimented. Nimrod was a bunch of different genres packed into one album. It shouldnt work but it does. The album has some of Green Days best songs like Scattered Hitchin A Ride and Good Riddance. The trilogy was some of Green Days worst especially TR! because it was the same thing for three albums. For a majority of it is the same formula for three albums verse chorus verse chorus solo chorus. At some point the songs blend together and when theres a lot of subpar songs with mediocre lyrics it bogs down the albums. Theyre are some great songs like Nuclear Family Amy and XKid but then there are songs like Troublemaker th Ave Serenade and Drama Queen. The albums reflect Billie Joes state of mind at the time and I think DOS! Is the best from the trilogy because of how well it reflects the drugged state of mind. At the same time I dont think they shouldve condensed it into one album because then you lose songs someone will enjoy. But the uneventful songwriting is its downfall and the reason Nimrods eventful song writing worked. ,greenday,dagoks6,12,t5_2snhx

They stop being strict as to what songs are good enough to make the cut so instead of getting  songs that are at the very least pretty good you get those  songs plus  that wouldnt have even made the pretty good cut had it not been a set of  albums. In the case of a double album its not like getting  albums for the price of one its getting a good album plus a second full of songs that wouldnt have been good enough to make the cut.

9844722,0,t1_daqrn5m,Gotcha. Yeah Pas is in standard tuning which can still be played in E Flat tuning using the same chord positions itll just be a step down. But as for your question yup theyll change tunings between songs and definitely be edited out if its dead time. These days hell just switch guitars. To reiterate even if they are tuned even a whole step down you can still watch what chords they are playing and apply it to any tuning. The key will be different but the progression and melody will be the same.Edit I didnt listen to the video version but others are saying its in Eb. ,greenday,daqsgm0,2,t5_2snhx

11003397,0,t3_5x0nx7,Its probably cliche to say this but some not all of the lyrics in Whatsername remind me of a girl I met in college that I became good friends with. We took the same major so we wound up in several courses together even before we got to know each other. She had just come off of a bad breakup with another guy so when I asked her one day if she wanted to have dinner with me she got a little uncomfortable she thought I was asking her out on a date when she wasnt ready. Really I was just trying to be friendly.  We would often confide in each other venting to each other about something that was frustrating us. She would always wait on me to leave the classroom at the end of the course or vice versa if I was out before her and we would walk together usually to her dorm or to grab a bite to eat. She would give me a parting hug until the next day we convened. As fate would have it both of us had our very last final in the same exact course so after it was all said and done we went downtown and had a drink to celebrate.  We graduated together and talked one final time in person. I thanked her for the memories and we went our separate ways. I never saw her again but we stay in touch over Facebook. I live in western Pennsylvania and she lives in New Jersey so we cant exactly drive over and meet up.  I often find myself thinking about her to this day. Maybe we couldve had something and Ive had dreams about her but I respect her decision if shes not ready to date. After all longdistance relationships couldnt work could they? I think we were a good match we had similar interests and we dealt with the same things.,greenday,def7c2s,1,t5_2snhx

Just go to class do the bare minimum of homework and study for an hour before the test and youll get a B. College is just go to class write everything the teacher says do the outside of class readings about ish hours of work per class outside of school on an easy week and study your heart out and you might pass. Its just weird going from senior year which is  social to  work to college which is just  work. I dont know how to explain it haha.,greenday,degyo77,2,t5_2snhx

11066091,0,t3_5y00ou,From personal experience you likely wont need them for these bigger arena tours. Went to the Houston show and I had a pair of eargasm ear plugs that I really liked but didnt use. I was right up by the barricade. Almost put them in for Against Me since they were a bit louder. Didnt need them for Green Day though. However my right ear did have some slight ringing the day after but that was from the little group of bitches call them that because they wouldnt fucking stop shoving and trying to push past me that wouldnt stop screaming wailing like banshees right in my ear. Now I will be going to see another concert Saturday that Im going to  use the ear plugs for. Its a small venue thats going to be very cramped. Its those kind of concerts that you for sure need them. Still doesnt hurt to bring a pair to Green Days show just incase though. Better safe than sorry. ,greenday,dembx9u,10,t5_2snhx
