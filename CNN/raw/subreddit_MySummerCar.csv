9434131,0,t3_59p6o7,Its a game of trial and error so far for MSC. If youre unfamiliar with how an engine is put together youll have to go through your toolbox and religiously inspect the part with each size wrench to make sure youre not missing anything. Its not a perfect system and it is quite easy to miss one unless youre very meticulous. Id advise you to build your first engine while using some form of guide to help you along your way. Its the definition of masochism if you dont IMO. Familiarize yourself with the parts and then try a blind build using what youve learned after. c,MySummerCar,d9bub90,0,t5_37vdy
9438246,0,t3_59m8qm,It is like driving a Semi they have LOW and HIGH range gears.  Low is for starting out under load while high is for higher speeds.  You should go through the low range switch to high range and go back to what would be st gear in Low Range and it would be the next gear up..  The Buzzing is the Low Warning Buzzard of the Air Brake System.  It happens when you put on or off the parking brake and have not got enough air in the system.. My advice is to floor it in N for a second to get the buzzard to go away. ,MySummerCar,d9cd4ej,1,t5_37vdy

9468252,0,t1_d9g5vlt,Hahaha I can just imagine the little satto spitting and coughing round the back of the house! I remember on my first working car I neglected to install the exhaust system because Muh Loud .. Yeah.. She backfired and spluttered and generally did not like that. Too true though about being so cautious with your vehicle. I have a mini heart attack whenever I hear the TechnoViking hammering down the highway! That guy is reckless as all hell!

9496552,0,t3_5auhu7,Nice video although I would added few words about the other knobs on the panel  what they do and when to use them. The diff. lock for example might be a bit of mystery for some people. ,MySummerCar,d9jnhoz,1,t5_37vdy

10222025,0,t3_5mdllb,One time I got my car from the mechanic and there was no belt on it anymore. Maybe check thatAlso save and restart your game. That could also be itIf it is a power problem... like nothing happens when your turn the key it can only be so many things. Alternator starter batteryIf it is turning over but not starting then it is fuel. Carburetor fuel filter spark plugs etcIm betting on the missing belt,MySummerCar,dc2q23w,3,t5_37vdy

10653810,0,t1_ddet6vx,If the engine was a tad over the running temp installing the racing radiator would be the way to fix that.Otherwise if the temp was fine Id recommend lowering the mixture slightly so its around .. You can easily do that yourself using the screwdriver.,MySummerCar,ddeux28,1,t5_37vdy
10680743,0,t1_ddhhddm,Tried that and unless theres something I missed because I couldnt push the car over the pit to properly install the handbrake then that didnt fix it.Its currently more effective to just walk into the car and move it at .mph than to push it,MySummerCar,ddhmyvz,1,t5_37vdy

11443286,0,t3_638rql,I think your CPU might be the culprit. I have an Athlon k the chip isnt that good it sucks at running some specific games especially games with engines that dont have great multithreaded utilisation.
