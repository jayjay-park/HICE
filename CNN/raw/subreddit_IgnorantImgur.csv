To me it just seems like a total waste of time and rather petty. Id understand them addressing their frustration but they do everything besides that and I think some of them might just believe that the OP is trying to make an attempt at frontpage which OP obviously wasnt so theyll trash OP.

5799855,0,t1_cxg0qry,Thats exactly what doesnt have anything to do with it. First of all if Jesus lived he wasnt born anywhere near Christmas  that much is known. Secondly the winter solstice and pretty much all traditions surrounding it were celebrated in many places long before Christianity took over. As I said Christians just slapped their name on it in an effort to remove nonChristian rituals and festivities. Easter is the same thing it was a festivity for the Saxon goddess Eostre hence the name in English and before that simply for the spring.Jesus has absolutely nothing to do with it. You might argue that it has become a Christian thing today. I would disagree with that but it doesnt change the point here because even so it would not preclude a nonChristian culture from celebrating it without the Christian touch.,IgnorantImgur,cxg0zju,6,t5_2z3r8
5815955,0,t1_cxi0bby,My feelings on it arent entirely summed up by my on principle statement perhaps I misspoke. I think its rude and closedminded to ban leftandright especially in a sub like that.Now if the community had started out that way then it wouldnt be such a big deal to me. It would be more of a situation where Id say well thats annoying. I wish I could participate in that sub but whatever. Instead IRL started out fairly accepting IIRC and over about a year took on draconian measures for what purpose? To keep a community based on a silly joke on track or respectful? Maybe if it had seen improvement then sure itd be fine. Take rpolandball for example. Even though the comments arent anything special the submission quality is kept fairly high due to their almost Naziesque moderation. But IRL went from selfies of the soul to images I find funny agree with or make people think Im cool IMO. It seemed in all its absurdity to have a semigenuine message at first and to have a bit of meaning. Now its just another dank meme landfill. And one must be afraid of what they say or theyll be banned. I dont think thats fair nor is it honest.I dont feel that Im really saying anyone has a right to browse the sub without being banned. But I also dont think that several people in power have the right to decide whats best for a community with zero input.Sorry if Im unclear. I always comment on mobile which makes it a little more difficult to be concise IMO.Edit Do you blame me for taking issue with this?,IgnorantImgur,cxi0uxn,4,t5_2z3r8

6323790,0,t1_cz2rzpb,Imgurs image feed shows stuff posted from Reddit and stuff posted from Imgur. Usersub is user submitted aka stuff posted from Imgur.Imgur doesnt have any sort of subimgurs so its like if you combined all of the SFW subreddits into one. So the quality of content is pretty bad. By browsing Imgur by the most upvoted twothirds the content is stuff thats risen because its actually good and the other third all just shitposts that survived. But when you browse usersub by newest first all of the content is just shit because theres no one filtering the content via downvoting the bad and upvoting the good.So the point of the insanity wolf above is that he browses through lots of shitposts with very occasional good ones. So that makes him insanely brave or something. He gets circlejerked to  points by others who browse usersub newest first.

9617246,0,t3_5coxyb,I sort of delved into this after seeing this post and the whole thing is very strange... Basically all of imgur is so butthurt that this chick didnt hula hoop naked for them. Her video is actually pretty funny. Before to hype it up she said she was putting together a team for lighting and sound effects and the video is littered with cheesy imovie sparkle effects added in over a cheeky synth song and then she isnt really hula hooping at one point she is just holding the hoop stationary and spinning herself in circles. Just trolling imgur who were collectively drooling at the thought of seeing some tits. Theyre so mad about it too. All of her comments are being downvoted to  oxymoron?. I mean just go to this permalink  and this one It gets even funnier that she set up a gofund me page afterwards just to fuck with everyone and theyre eating it up apparently unaware that they do not have to actually donate if they do not want to. ,IgnorantImgur,d9yiujr,119,t5_2z3r8
