3161034,0,t1_copmi8t,From what Ive seen I still do not see any evidence that the Prime Minister actively lied to this House. His first statement was unclear and could be interpreted incorrectly. He then clarified this in his second statement. As for this piece brought by the member of DufferinCaledon I still do not see evidence of lying.What I see is happening is the member of DufferinCaledon contacted the moderators to ask if some members who do not meet a falsely perceived requirement can join the parliament. Taking this as a moderator the Prime Minister discussed this with other moderators and arrived with the statement presented. It is entirely possible that the Prime Minister believed that he was not the first point of contact. We do not know what the Speaker told the Prime Minister during the moderator conversation and it is therefore possible that this confusion occurs. The Prime Minister then replied to the member of DufferinCaledon that the constitution is not clear and needs some changes and informs him that the member may proceed at his own judgment and may contact the Speaker for more information on how to get the prospective members involved.From what I can see that is what happened. This may not be what actually happened but from the pieces provided by the member of DufferinCaledon and the statements made by both him and the Prime Minsiter I see no evidence that the Prime Minister lied.,cmhoc,copn144,1,t5_356s4

9176170,0,t3_55y6hd,Mr. SpeakerUnregulated prostitution and escort services cause young women to fear for their lives on the street. It perpetuates gang violence perpetuates the pimp mentality and places womens lives in great danger when they are simply trying to make a living for themselves. Simply going after the customers of escorts and prostitutes will not solve the underlying problem which is that there are communities in Canadaoften minority communitiesthat have been neglected starved of resources and abandoned. These women make the choice to engage in these oftentimes dangerous activities because they feel there is no other choice.It is ultimately the individuals choice how and under what circumstances they use their body and any harm they put themselves in is selfinduced. However we should work wherever possible to reduce the possible harm and I support this act for that reason. We are helping to keep women away from street prostitution away from Johns and pimps away from gang activity and street drugs. They have the opportunity to begin their own legitimate businesses far away from these dangers and to make a life for themselves unfettered by social stigma by law enforcement and by the adrenaline of being involved in more violent crime.Prostitution when it is the womans own choice and when she is treated with dignity when she does not face rape by a person she trusted to be a customer when she does not face the constant threat of being arrested for performing a service performed for thousands of years when she has the right and privilege to call the police after being raped without facing particular scrutiny for her choice of career then Mr. Speaker it is a victimless crime. ,cmhoc,d8f5ar2,3,t5_356s4

9296463,0,t1_d8tnt8g,Mr. SpeakerI feel that the member is completely misunderstanding my previous statement which perhaps didnt add the detail necessary to convey my idea. Mental health issues are often the underlying cause of violent behaviour something that health journals have proven time and time again. It does not mean that criminals are mentally ill but it does mean that violence stems from psychological conditioning that can be alleviated through mental health programs. I am not presuming that we assume that all inmates who are violent are mentally illfar from it. What I am presuming Mr. Speaker is that individuals who spend time in solitary confinement are being placed in the wrong environment for too long a period of time. They should have a chance to interact with others which is why I suggest that they be placed in their own holding area. At least this way the individual can interact with others that they know and perhaps calm down. I would caution that this would be the case only for the most highsecurity facitilies the members response assumes that all prisons are the samehighsecurity large border walls security cameras all over the placewhen there are many low and mediumsecurity prisons that allow individuals to share a room with other inmates. That was my rational for allowing prisoners to go back to their own cells rather than to solitary confinement.What I am proposing is fair for one reason and one reason alone and the member said it themselves our prison system is more than a century old. Our punative penitentiary system costs Canada billions of dollars a year to maintain and puts a severe strain both on the justice system and on community police. When a prisoner leaves the prison system do they feel that their time has been well spent? Have they had a chance to become better citizens? Are we giving them the skills they need to be successful? I would say no Mr. Speaker. I feel that we need to have a much better classification system for different crimes a system which places offenders in the right environment as I stated before so that they can benefit from the experience of incarceration. Our current classification system is simply indictable offense summary offense or hybrid which doesnt adequately convey the offense. Canadas penal system costs us . billion a year. We house  prisoners in federal custody and  in community programs many of which are disproportionately members of the First Nations and minority communities. Our outdated prison system is targeting minorities at the expense of our communities creating a revolving door for individuals where they commit a crime go to prison and return because they have difficulty adapting back into society. We need to smooth the transition between prison and the community and this is why I would ask for more offenders entering community programs and watch programs rather than prison.This is the preventative approach I mentioned. We should place individuals who have addictions in addiction treatment facilities we should place nonviolent offenders either in community programs or in a lowsecurity facility we should place violent offenders in more secure facilities and yes Mr. Speaker we should recommend longterm community treatment for individuals with mental illnesses. ,cmhoc,d8ue61z,1,t5_356s4
9326333,0,t3_5834vb,Mr. SpeakerThe goals of this bill are laudable but there are better ways to encourage recycling than the bureaucratic nightmare of registering  million Canadians as this bill would do.

Good for you using mainstream ad homeniem attacks. gti did recycle during my tough times because you get paid if you bring recycling to these places.As there is an incentive to do so in your case while recycling in your bill does not. It incurs a hefty fine.  gt  yes my family didnt live environmentally friendly we had to make ends meet. Thats the answer i sought for. Thank you for admitting that making ends meet is more important over being environmentally friendly. The Canadian people now know that youre being ironically hypocritical now that you have a better livelihood. gt however we werent lazy enough to not bring our damn soda cans to a center occasionally especially when i can make some money from it.Due to the fact there is an incentive and not a regulation that youll be fined for! gt Plus its only  dollars if you dont recycle in  MONTHSThats a lot of money if youre financially strapped each month. gt and as specified in the act there is many ways to simply be exempt from the fine.As I see it Section C of your bill has no clause exempting lower income families from paying the fine if they cannot afford it. There is only medical and location exemptions. You put a ton of points into the midst through your argument. However the points included dont add up Pollution isnt directly from nonrecycling. Its actually from the globalization and overseas cheap labor made possible by governments like yours. Charging citizens for your own problems isnt a solution.  Your Clean Canada Act isnt for a cleaner Canada per say. There isnt regulations to force Canadian corporations to manufacture locally but charge the citizens who already have a burden to bear. If its truly for Clean Canada there should be a merger of previous legislation to be comprehensively that name.  The Clean Canada Act does not also cover low income and affordability clauses.

11129577,0,t3_5ywolt,Mr. SpeakerCanada is open for all people and religions regardless of beliefs. As long as you believe in our values you will be accepted in this country and are invited to become part of our cultural mosaic. I attribute this to the great Pierre Trudeau. He enshrined multiculturalism in our constitution in a period of instability in Canada when fear and bigotry threatened to take Canada hostage and I forever thank him for this. I love how multicultural Canada has become with rd of all Canadian childrens parents being immigrants. However there is always the downside of attacks from bigoted individuals that cannot see the beauty in a cultural mosaic and want us to become more like our hateful neighbors to the south. Right wing extremeism has reared its ugly head in Quebec with the murder of  Muslims simply praying. They all had children and were all born in Canada. The only crime they committed  was praying to their god and travelling to Canada to make a better life for themselves. They were Canadian regardless of what some Islamophobic individuals say. All religions shall be protected in our Charter. So I ask this government with the safety of religious Canadians on the line How will the Honourable Minister for Public Safety insure the safety of Christians in Canada with this disturbing increase of Islamic extremism across the west?,cmhoc,detj0fa,2,t5_356s4

Ignoring the massive waste of government resources it is a clear violation of the freedom of Canadians and I am utterly against it. It is also odd Mr Speaker for Canada to be part of a treaty that it rightly violates. So exiting this treaty is the right course of action. I thank the Minister for bringing forward this Legislation. ,cmhoc,dgj2rj6,1,t5_356s4
