11354517,0,t1_dfj0eap,Yep trust would hurt more than help. Even saying that Im covering you could be construed as suspicious. But I think the true innocents need to focus on the DGs amongst them and not risk losing an innocent most likely TNTM to kill a DG here. Ive chosen to silence you so if you really are a DG and my silencing still works you arent a threat this phase. ,TheUpsideDown,dfj0hvn,2,t5_3fjw6
11367362,0,t1_dfkfnap,I guess I was saying that we should tell them that awesome had parents  we werent sure if special kids were in family units. But at this point I dont know if that info is super helpful. So message alligator silenced will target basketball next. Concise hopefully wont get too garbled? ,TheUpsideDown,dfkgvlw,3,t5_3fjw6
