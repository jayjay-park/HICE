763088,0,t1_cgr0bo5,It wouldnt hurt to try. I wish I would have done it when I had the chance. I now have so much shit going on. Regardless there really no over head except for marketing. But if everything goes right which if you live in a fairly large city the chances are that it will. Im assuming there are a lot of people who would pay extra for the convenience of having something delivered and not having to get up and go out in the middle of the nightbig eventheavy drinking. Plus if you made a app it would make it so much more easier to use because people hate calling people. lol But then again Im delusional. ,bikemessengers,cgr0p42,1,t5_30elq

1686279,0,t3_2dhtfr,New Brunswick NJThe first JJ store in NJ. We have  bikers on the roster. We have  for the lunch rush. Since its a college towncity its usually dead in summer and winter breaks. Fall and Spring are busy. We may have  or  bikers for lunch rush when school starts. A new JJ in Hoboken opened up and they do bike deliveries as well. No clue on their roster. We would hit  deliveries for a day near the end of a week.  I cant imagine how some stores would have  to  bikers for lunch shifts and god forbid  of them call out for their day.,bikemessengers,cjrpxdn,1,t5_30elq

6312842,0,t3_421duq,The only thing thats dumb is using the wrong tool for the job. For example dudesdudettes who work in PhillyNYC where packages are paper zones are smalldense dead flat snows regularly? Trackfixed makes sense there.Here in EUG and from what I know about TCB in SF zones are biggerhillier packages are liquid and rain is a bigger deal than snow? A range of ratios and handbrakes help much and hinder little. Personally I work four days at a shop and one on the bike so I have a lot of time and resources to make my bike run right. My day on the bike is an hour shift three of which Im on my own in a square mile zone. So I make it easy on myself with a x drivetrain hydraulic disc brakes fat tires full fenders and dynamo lights. ,bikemessengers,cz777gl,4,t5_30elq
