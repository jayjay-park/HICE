7273502,0,t3_4f0kgu,Seiera had been walking through the forest for what seemed like days maybe weeks maybe months she couldnt tell. But eventually she made her way through the forest through the scrub and into the pastures where she found a river much like the one back home.Strolling along the bank of the river she soon began to realise that this was her home albeit slightly changed. The changes were unsettling but welcoming she knew not of why they had changed perhaps falling in the river had messed with her memories perhaps this was how it had been all along.In the distance she could spot her families house she could spot the designated free farming land that the local chief had given those further away from the lake as a method of free farmland. Small trenches dug in the ground siphoned water to the crops and wheat grew along the river banks mostly owned by the chief and those deemed elders within the village.Sweet soft music from the village centre far away from the designated agrarian lands to the west filled her with joy. Mother often took her to the village centre to sell the special fruits they grew.Remnants from the equinox festival remained in the village Seiera crouched down near an effigy and observed it the ashes were cold and little remained of the burned hay how long had she been out.In front of her the towering conical building formed from wood bamboo and thatch stood. She walked through one of the vertical openings of the building into the centre of it which was marked with a dry dirt floor. Above her men and women stood and sat on the suspended levels of the building which one could get to via the ladders scattered around the place. This was the town hall she had visited nearly every week of her life.In the corner a large piece of pelt was dangling suspended by makeshift rope. They had called it the counter and it was their only way of recording and predicting the days ahead. From the marks and runes drawn onto it in a thick cherry red substance she could gather that it was only a week until the next festival the festival of the suns embodiment a once in a life time experience.,FromTheGroundUp,d24y5ox,1,t5_35s4q

Honi pause for a moment before continuing. I personally have come to oversee a grand experiment that will benefit all people. Honi proceed to explain his experiment After rambling on for a time Honi stops midsentence to look over Phlegeths shoulder before pointing out the young man approaching them I assume that young man is not one of yours.M to find the experiment look under the Measurement of the Earth part of the wiki page. also I am considering this my replay to ujonassn,FromTheGroundUp,d2abzjh,1,t5_35s4q

7382483,0,t3_4gg6di,Barring extraneous circumstances you are to control your civilizations populace.You can in theory claim an entire region with a meager number of persons. However do not expect to be able to harvest those resources at a meaningful rate. Nor should you expect a favorable outcome in the event that another civilization attempts to claim that land for themselves.In the rare event that you encounter an NPC civilization you will be informed of such.The point at which the mods control playerowned populace actions is a gray area. The best way to describe my approach is this. You personally will always be informed of the events of an exploration provided that your exploration team is able to return to an allied settlement.. The further away an action is taken from your allied settlements the longer you must wait to be notified of results.. If a team of yours dies or disappears or is somehow prevented from returning then you will be informed that they do not return from their mission.. If you are told that they do not return then you may send either more explorers or a military force to investigate the missing group. This will reveal evidence to you of what may have happened. The only exception to this is in the event that some action was taken by a third party to interfere with such an investigation.. In the event that a exploration party encounters another players civilization that group will not return until their personal interaction is completed. Basically until you post a comment in such a thread indicating that your team is returning to report their findings I will need to assume that they have not yet left.Long distance means of communication are a significant technological achievement and are difficult to achieve at this point in time.If anyone has any questions about this please ask here.,FromTheGroundUp,d2hc6sk,2,t5_35s4q
