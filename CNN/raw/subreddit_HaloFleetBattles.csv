7810993,0,t1_d3t4jmd,Both. You know its interesting because I never thought most here would be solely focused on the gameplay. Being a fan of the story AND the game Im looking at the ships from a weird angle. On one hand I want a worthwhile new ship on the other Id like a ship that has a cool place in the story. While Im sure a more efficient player would never put a massive in their fleet I went ahead and bought the CASClass Assault Carrier. Too hard to not pass up from myself loving the ship itself and it providing a gameplay change up in the form of an element that operates differently.So I guess my question now changes to what should I get on the UNSC side to counter my purchase of the Assault Carrier OTHER than the Punic. ,HaloFleetBattles,d3u0qj7,2,t5_398fh
