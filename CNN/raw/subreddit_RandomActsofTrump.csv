8876184,0,t1_d7es1sb,I just replied above.  I created the sub.  I mod another Trump sub.  You may know me as Pete that prank called CSPAN with the tendie meme during the DNC.   If you want to know something just ask.  I understand your caution but this isnt some scam.,RandomActsofTrump,d7esj1f,27,t5_3g71g
8881579,0,t1_d7f8159,IMHO the best way to demonstrate the voter ID debate is by tying it to gun control. If people claim that we need to make sure the mentally ill arent buying guns then surely theyll agree we should make sure the mentally ill arent voting for the people who make gun control laws.,RandomActsofTrump,d7ffv3r,3,t5_3g71g

8889617,0,t1_d7gdes4,ABSOLUTELY.Full Metal Jacket ammo fmj is for practice fun and putting holes in paper. Hollowpoints are a must for defense they are for putting holes in people. Handguns simply arent powerful enough otherwise. Personally I will always recommend a ga shotgun with reduced recoil  buckshot. very very important to PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE should you go that route. Much more difficult to run a shotgun in stressful situations than handgun. The old addage is your handgun is for fighting back to your long gun that you shouldnt have dropped in the first place,RandomActsofTrump,d7gemmm,2,t5_3g71g
8889657,0,t1_d7gazp0,Whatever you can shoot the best and are most confident with should be your choice. I will say revolvers are fool proof in that you do not need to worry about a slide. The Ruger gp is built like a tank and very popular for a reason. Personally I would choose . splp over full house . for defending home less recoil blast and flash easier followup shots. Stay away from heavy gr hunting ammo for defense and dont bother with . spl. My  cents,RandomActsofTrump,d7gesue,2,t5_3g71g
