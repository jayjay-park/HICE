5332505,0,t1_cvsqbis,Oh god yes this game is hard.  I love it to death but the original Megacity was like a Zen thing so I totally didnt expect having to build decks and choose skills properly playing this.I love the music to death though.  It reminds me of another game I cant seem to put my finger on it.,YouShouldPlay,cvtaclw,1,t5_2vy5p
5352839,0,t3_3n573q,Do you mind older games? Seriously check out Arx Fatalis. Old school game its partially open world think Dark Souls with multiple branches but not truly open like Skyrim. It has a magic system relying on Runes that you have to find throughout the world. You combine them by drawing them on the screen to cast an insane number of combination spells. Seriously I wrote out a cheat sheet I had beside me at all times. You can precast and save  spells because it can be difficult to do in battle. Really fun game.,YouShouldPlay,cvvvw33,1,t5_2vy5p

8455055,0,t1_d5y62nx,you can buy in for instant access if youre a past hardcore tribes fan that hasnt heard of this game yet. ya im canvassing in a way. ya this is in a indie game supported by no volunteers with a very small marketing budget. no i dont work them at all. i didnt know this forum prevented the hardcore prealpha tester community from contributing!i guess ill come back when the games instant access is better priced and free play as its designed to be? this is an early access game for a reason ,YouShouldPlay,d5yf0ty,1,t5_2vy5p
