4142239,0,t1_crrvw3q,Port forwarding makes it so people can connect properly with you directly without security hassle. Im willing to carry you and other lvl ers I could actually use it Ive never actually played through the story in multiplayer just random lvls bc they were already so far. I find it annoying and I wish theyd communicate better now there are players who care but theyre sparse and not always online. ,HeroSiege,crsfl1f,1,t5_30d4e
