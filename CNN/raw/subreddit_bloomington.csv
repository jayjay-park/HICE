845388,0,t3_23rqdi,I work for the county so although Im not an attorney I can give you some general advice. Has the landlord already filed the eviction with the courts? Just as an FYI if the landlord is nasty and claiming intimidation like you said theyre probably going to file an emergency eviction. You would think youd have to supply a lot of proof to get it but all they have to say they were threatened with bodily harm and bam your friends suddenly dont get the hearing in  weeks like they normally would and instead have as little as  days to get their stuff ready and come to court and if the judge is in court which happens a lot the court reporter is the one that actually makes that decision. Further the time to leave the premises is then drastically reduced too.  Point being they probably have extremely little time to be getting these quotes and pictures together. If you can show a history of violations by the landlord no notice showing up and letting themselves in not fixing the property etc. AND show a history of them doing this with other tenants then they may have a shot depending which judge they get.  There are subpoena forms they can get in the clerks office for both people an documents so once theyre served with the eviction notice they can come and in get them and have any witnesses come to court with them for the hearing although warning dont bring too many or youll tick off the judge. Good luck and dont have them wait because they probably wont have much time soon. The judges arent stupidthey know which companies have a bad rep. Its actually funny at times because theyll come in and file find out what court they were assigned to and freak because that judge has it in for me and just doesnt get it.,bloomington,ch0dhsh,2,t5_2r8ly

Organic shouldnt mean higher prices organic should mean no to low pesticide. Have you actually looked at the markup for some of these items?  at times and people justify it to themselves because its organic and apparently organic is synonymous with expensive.

4925820,1,t1_cufcu4o,I mean its a lot better than most small towns but really a far cry from good.High turnout is probably because relative to most Midwestern small towns Ive heard Bloomington is pretty great.If youre going to compare to Newport Beach Beverly Hills the SGV suburbs South Bay suburbs Hells Kitchen Williamsburg etc. Bloomington doesnt really stack up even to these small towns in either both value or quality. Yes you get more for what you pay for in overpriced Beverly Hills than you do in Bloomington.Even the tiny town half the size of Bloomington that I lived when I was living in Germany had a two star restaurant until Dieter Kaufmann retired last year.In America Ive only lived on the coasts before coming here but Bloomington is by far bar none the worst place for food Ive ever lived. Everything is relative. For a small town in Indiana I dont doubt that Bloomington is pretty good. Ive been to Martinsville twice and a few Indianapolis suburbs a couple times and Bloomington was better than that. Thus I did add the qualifier if youre from a cityAlso theyre not all owned by the Dalai lamas brother but Tibetan food is nowhere near as rare as you think. I hope I dont have to explain to you how bad and overpriced the East Asian food is around here though Southeast Asian food is fairly good and decently priced until you get to South Asia which would be somewhere in between.Bloomington is good for its size but we dont live in a world where every town is tiny and there are many other small towns with much much incomparably better food.,bloomington,cuffshh,2,t5_2r8ly

I would say much the same thing if I lived in I dunno Cleveland I sort of hated Cleveland except for the out of place food scene.  I want to stress that its not about whether the coast is better than Bloomington or Bloomington is better than the coasts.I once read another aphorism this one from a strangely lyrical web comic that Home is a time not a place.  Its resonated more strongly with me as Ive gotten older moved away moved back sold off the house I grew up in otherwise severed the anchor line between where Ive been and where I am.For me Bloomington is mostly home not because its the only place in Indiana where you can get a halfway decent pho but because of the phenomenal people I knew here during what was probably the most exhilarating part of my life.  The vividness and immediacy of that memory more than incidentals like international cuisine is most of what makes Bloomington feel like home to me.  And now those people are scattered across the world but because of that time I am connected to this place.You can build those bonds anywhere you happen to be from Petit Trois to a Russian Gulag.

Find a personal way in whether its walking in and introducing yourself or volunteering somewhere with a woman who knows a guy.

My point is that you are saying that you want to have a conversation with someone and if they feel unsafe during that conversation thats their problem not yours. That suggestion shows a lack of regard for the other person in that conversation. So why are you having a conversation with them? Doesnt sound like its because you really care about that other person. Sounds like its because its something you want to do whether they do or not.Edit And you may be getting defensive because you think this does not apply to you that you are a nice guy who is trying to start conversation and this is not how you think about the people youre trying to talk to and if someone feels uncomfortable youll notice and leave. But the other person doesnt know if youre the kind of person thats gonna notice and leave or if youre the kind of person thats not going to care and follow them.,bloomington,d7xuo5r,0,t5_2r8ly

My parents make enough to be solidly in the middle of the middle class meaning no FAFSA or st century scholars. And unfortunately Im white so no huge minority scholarships for me. So I work  hours a week delivering food on top of my class work. A lot of people on campus are in the same situation so acting like one group has it worse is ridiculous.,bloomington,ddhp42j,0,t5_2r8ly

10832760,0,t1_ddwnv2a,Im not the OP of the comment youre responding to but I could probably explain.When warnings are circulated under the color of legal authority police or military that portray protest movements as violent or radical then it does sow fear when those warnings are not based on accurate information or a legitimate aim to help people avoid danger.  Saying with the apparent weight of the authorities that there will be some public danger when it isnt true does seem to be sowing fear.I didnt downvote you for the record.  But I would suggest that you examine the definition of irony.,bloomington,ddxbmwv,4,t5_2r8ly

11022099,0,t3_5xdh6r,I got acrylics a couple times at Nikki Nails on the west side and really liked the end result. I remember the cost being in line with what I expected. The conversation was good too not too much but good content. Both times left the areas around my nails feeling pretty beat up and sore for a couple days  but unfortunately this has always been my experience with getting acrylics done as someone who has pretty much zero natural nail from bitingtearing and as someone who never gets manicures so my fingers are not used to being worked over.I know tons of people who go religiously to Maitsunami sp? in the strip mall at rd and Dunn so they must be good. Most of them go for manicures and gel color though so Im not sure if their acrylic game is as strong.,bloomington,dehbp7f,3,t5_2r8ly

11087428,0,t3_5y8k0v,My two cents This is really bad. I do welcome the improvements to the community. But not at the cost of screwing the county which is what will happen. I think the city is making a huge mistake and is acting out in greed to the detriment of the entire county. Heres why The areas proposed for annexation are the most densely populated areas of Monroe County that do not fall under the citys taxable area. These areas are close enough to the city to support a large population while being able to funnel a large amount of tax income to the county. These taxes include property tax income tax motor vehicle tax and associated taxesfees gambling taxes excise tax and other smaller ones that arent that important. Because of this the rural parts of our county are able to benefit. Its a symbiotic relationship that is complex in nature.  When the annexation completes the newly incorporated areas will then pay all tax to the city not to the county. These taxes will become completely redistributed to the city and the county will completely lose them as revenue. This will severely negatively affect the following services a Fireb Police County Sheriff c Township library servicesd School services notably busing servicee County road improvementCounty firefighters have already been clamoring in County Council meetings showing their projected budget loses and what that will do to their services. City sanitation workers have already said theyll be hard pressed to services the new areas of the city. County schools know they will be hit hard they are collecting tax data currently to show the County Council exactly how hard. You may rebut and say Oh but the city fire services will be able to service the annexed areas now. Correct but there are a lot of areas in Monroe Co. that will not be annexed and with a severely slashed budget they will be nearly ineffectual. The reason why Monroe Co. is nice and has such nice service is because of the aforementioned symbiotic relationship the city is damaging.  The Public Safety Tax recently levied in Monroe Co. which was projected to assist emergency services throughout the county will no longer be of relief after the annexation. Contrary to what the City Commissioner has said income tax does not follow the population. The city will be collecting the majority of that tax and knew that before announcing annexation plans. Hence the mentioning of the word greed.  I live in a proposed annexation area. The majority if not all of the proposed areas are already developed and already have significant access to services that they already pay taxes on! There is literally no need for the city to annex these areas under the guise of development and providing better services. Essentially its a tax grab. The city wants the property and income tax of these areas. This will negatively affect me and my neighbors! Bloomington is clearly trying to correct its terrible economic practices. In doing so this land grab will neuter the County endanger county residents outside the city and annexation areas and cause a needless tax burden. Please go to City Council Chambers the week of March th at p on Monday Tuesday and Friday and a on Wednesday Thursday and Saturday to let the City Council know the symbiotic relationship between the County and City is important and its far too soon for the City to grow at the expense of rural areas and at the expense of tax payers.,bloomington,deor0n1,10,t5_2r8ly
