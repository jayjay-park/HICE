2236627,0,t1_clnz29o,Kinda in my head its more about how it plays. I have a design doc thats  pages long and thats just the ideas I put to paper. Simply put the main draw of the game is how expansive it is. I dream of a game where not every person has to pick up a gun and shoot people on the ground. There would be dedicated support and command roles. Flying a black hawk should be a viable role and not just something you take to the fight and throw away. I also imagine a detailed command structure with the ability to hire AI to fill out the roles people dont want to play such as being the ammo loader on a  man tank crew. On a larger scale I would like to see a commander be able to take control of an entire AI platoon and play the game as an RTS. Options options options. There is also an ever present economy. Every shot fired is money out of your pocket and every time you die you lose your gear. For example if you rock some plate armor and m  mags and some other basic gear your load out might costs  a spawn. If you get lets say k a kill you need a . KDR to break even. However if you deck your self out in all sorts of crazy crap and bring a anti air missle with you it will cost k and you need a . KDR to break even. It also incentives not dumping ammo or vehicles. You are going to think twice about dropping that jdam that you dropped k on or bailing on your  million dollar plane.

2769887,0,t3_2rqtoi,Since you guys talked about gamers being fat and diets I wanted to pass by and share my current story. I have been a gamer and anime fan pretty much all my life thanks to my older brother and I am fat a walking stereotype one would say. A little bit more than a year ago I started to diet and exercise and lost a lot of weight I was happy about this changes and being honest I felt the same but looked way better. At some time in  I got really depressed because of.. reasons... and pretty much said fuck it to my diet and exercise routines now on  I am back to my old weight. After a medical checkup I can say that I am a healthy man but fat that may be attributed to my age  or Its just a ticking bomb waiting to blow up. Now I do think that me being fat and me liking anime and video games has absolutely nothing to do with each other I am fat because I have terrible eating habits and being a gamer has nothing to do with it.  I believe that people should not care about stereotypes therefore should not take any actions on the gamers are fat stereotype whatsoever who gives a fuck what people think?. That said I do wish to have a healthy life and all of us who feed the fire of the bad stereotypes should take more care about our ourselves not for the gaming community but for our own good. Now to say that I believe on my own words I cant say that I am over my depression but my brain is over making excuses to not return to my diet and exercise routines so  will be the year of getting back in shape. My only say on how to get back in shape is that there is no magical recipe the diet  exercise formula will never change but you have to find what kind of diet and exercise works for you I am fortunate to have found mine so Im worst for not taking advantage of it xD. This comment may disappear on the endless stream of reddit still I would like to say that you guys are inspirational in a lot of ways. I may not have been inspired by you guys to get back in shape but you do make me feel like I am not alone for some reason. If any of you may remember my username I shall post a second part to this story in about  months and I hope that not only the IG guys but the community itself can get either a smile on their faces or support on the journey to a healthy life. ,InsideGaming,cnixcaw,4,t5_2xyqu

2835140,0,t3_2sikn8,Just to give Spoole perspective on console gaming. Personally its got nothing to do with graphics or more performance on PC. Personally I love Steam buying a game once and being able to play it on any computer I buy in the future is a nice little bonus. Playing multiplayer FPS is so much more engaging on a mouse and keyboard. There are tons of reasons to love PCs.But why I prefer gaming on a console is because of the setup. Even if you drop a massive amount on money on your PC buy the very best monitors best headphones itll still probably not be as good as a pretty decent TV  range. The best gaming monitors colorwise arent as nice as a really good TV unless you go for a monitor designed for color work which is  alone. Resolution matters little from your couch and if you can actually tell the difference your likely sitting too close to your tv anyway. I have a pair of Shure SE headphones and games sound incredible on my PC but even a simple soundbar on my home theater whilst not as good is just as engaging when playing Assassins Creed or Wolfenstein.Again for some games Battlefield MMOs Total War PC is so much nicer but if you have a halfway decent home theater and most people do nowadays since its not crazy priced anymore sitting on your comfortable couch playing games on the biggest screen in your house is just more fun. Especially when you consider that even though consoles are never as powerful the fact that a GTX  costs more then a console and you still need to drop another few thousand to build the rest of the system using the setup in your home is just a more comfortable way to game.Also though not as prevalent today multiplayer games like Smash Bros Fifa Madden etc. are more fun with a large screen and friends on the same couch.,InsideGaming,cnqcnvh,1,t5_2xyqu
2836729,0,t1_cnqhezb,gt What exactly do you mean by passing on political views?    This could be a huge range of things that could either be the focus of a game or just a passing comment. There could be a COD game where either Hamas or Israel are shown as the definite baddies or a game where USA gun laws or a change to them areis criticized. These sorts of things though would have to be knowingly outside of the game be linked to a specific party or the linkage be implied in the game. Perhaps the Government in the game could just happen to be DemocraticRepublican. ConservativeLiberal views maybe be offhandedly criticizedpraised by characters.   While I agree that a lot of this that exists at the moment is simply developers personal beliefs and I feel thats ok. They shouldnt go out of the to reduce this for the sake of not trying to offend anyone.     gtDo I think a presidential candidate might some day put ads in a game?    I would doubt the party itself would directly be influencing video games or related content.  But when the parties are receiving millions of dollars in donations I personally dont seem it too far fetched for a third party to make such an influence on the gaming scene to benefit their favoured party.,InsideGaming,cnqj6lo,1,t5_2xyqu

Now HZ is a little different because they are charging  for early access to a free to play game. However they did the same thing with PS and that turned out all right. However personal opinion I dont think HZ is going to be any good. After following the gaming industry you can get a pretty good feeling for how a game is going to turn out by looking at the first bits of public media and listening to what the devs have to say. I feel like the devs over reached and in the wrong areas while also choosing to follow a half assed art style. It must be impossible to a game like DayZ that isnt fucked up. ,InsideGaming,cnvk9f3,2,t5_2xyqu

2882291,0,t3_2t3xqj,This is a comment from CozmicSaber in the YT comments figured Id post it here so you all can see it since its pretty accurate despite being awkwardly wordedgt I Really use to like this fucking show but now that I have previous Knowledge  on a topic HZ. I know how much of the whole story the actually told. The percentage of the story they gave was not even . Heres how the story goes over the course of  months. They told us about air drops and  the community thought it was a good idea over the course of several streams we got more info being that air drops can contain rare itemsloot. This was a player driven event and idea. The thought process of SOE is that since the community was okay with its Air drop that there were going to be no problems with it at launch. But as was stated that Air drops do Contain rare items which is the reason youve seen Guns in them.The community didnt think that was included. Now the part that Inside Gaming Daily didnt explain. The Dev team and the CEO of SOE have been transparent since day  one if one ask them a question you would get a answer. If you want proof Just ask me and I will show you. At launch of HZ Air Drops were bugged and so were zombies for unknown reasons. The Air Drop was supposed to be dropped in a m radius but instead it was dropped straight on your head which is why people said that with was Pay to Win. Like I said it was a bug. Within a  Hour period a patch came out and fixed m radius to what is now m with a minim of  player on a server to activate it. At first the game seemed almost or was Pay to Win but now its fixed and it very hard to get you own order Air Drop with the addition of a  chance of getting crap and only a  chance of getting a gun. Just look around YouTube a twitch and watch the currently patched air drops. I think Inside Gaming Daily really owes the Devs a apology for trying to ruin their and HZs as a game Credit.Since the commenter said he has proof of transparency but didnt provide any I will. John Smedley agreed that Airdrops were PW on day . They were then fixed the next day  Adam Clegg a designer on HZ apologizing for what the community saw as him lying about the content of Airdrops he also explicitly details the ways that they were fixed Ill probably update this with more examples if I can find any.,InsideGaming,cnvpwh8,0,t5_2xyqu

2900754,0,t1_cnxqeo1,I think its one of those things that all the previous attempts were before their time and we are finally moving into an era where this technology is more practical. However it will take awhile for people to warm up to the idea that its a legitimate product. We are seeing the emergence of the new age of how we integrate with technology. Oculus Rift Gear VR Razers OSVR Microsofts Hololense Glassesless D Google Glass smart watches screens that bend and fold away. I think the next ten years is going to be pretty fucking crazy. ,InsideGaming,cnxtkt5,1,t5_2xyqu
2900861,0,t1_cnxtkt5,I agree. I think Google Glass was too ahead of its time and didnt really do much to enhance your experience. Oculus seems very cool but AR seems like itll be more appealing to VR at least to most people. Still Microsoft products are never given a pass like other companys products are so if its getting this much praise Im way more excited about this compared to how I was with Kinect where I thought lol Im not going to stand in front of my TV. ,InsideGaming,cnxu0mm,2,t5_2xyqu

2928444,0,t1_co0s5x7,Its not very constructive to  proclaim a sweeping statement to try and discredit everything Ive said. As I stated its an extremely pervasive ideology and one that has manifested in all facets of our culture from our medias portrayal of exercise to the explosion in lowcalorie snacks. If you want to assume you know best without actually applying any sort of effort and investigate what the grand majority of modern research has indicated be my guest. But if you talk to anyone remotely involved in nutritional science what I am saying is old news and not even a little bit controversial. Uprooting these deeply set assumptions regarding health requires effort on your side do a simple google search of is a calorie a calorie. Click the hyperlink. Do something other than firmly planting your feet because what you think you knew is being challenged. Because there are people out there dedicating their lives towards finding these answers and what you think you know is the stuff they were guessing at  years ago. Remember nutrition is a science that is still in infantile years. If you accept early theories as gospel you are doing nothing but perpetuating archaic theories. ,InsideGaming,co0z3j8,-1,t5_2xyqu
