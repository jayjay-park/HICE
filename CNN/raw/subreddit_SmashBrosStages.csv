2557032,0,t3_2p11d0,This one didnt turn out as well as I had wanted but here are my rules Items Pokeballs only Players Each player is assigned a podium. The only two actions you may make are jumping into the stadium to grab a Pokeball and jumping back up to your podium to use it.It gets crazy fun when youre trying to dodge multiple Pokemon to get a pokeball and return to your podium.,SmashBrosStages,cmscb8e,3,t5_34ten

2922115,0,t3_2tjnkh,Not to be an asshole but this subreddit is for cool stages that have some effort put into them. Literally anybody could make this stage in less than a minute.If youre on this subreddit then you can do better. Otherwise dont bother with this.,SmashBrosStages,co094rx,0,t5_34ten

3701830,0,t1_cqe7pun,Would be awesome!  My hope is well start seeing a lot more cool stuff from Miiverse in the next couple of days.  Right now  I feel like Ive seen everything thats been posted and the stages sub has sort of dominated the quality North American posts.  Go us     .. Except maybe not in the SmashArt depot.  I feel like were going to be seeing a lot of unfamiliar faces showing promise with the editor.  ,SmashBrosStages,cqe8enk,2,t5_34ten

3930853,0,t1_cr47ros,No worries.     The nature of smash mechanics makes it a very restrictive game to design for. Especially with such a limited tool kit.  Makes what youve done all the more  impressive.  None of my criticisms were meant to take away from that.   ,SmashBrosStages,cr4cpps,2,t5_34ten
