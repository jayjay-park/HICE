2327437,0,t3_2l3z6g,Will Rement Stick to Your ContainersPART  This is turning out to be more complex and longer than I thought.  Im in Arizona where it is dry and I have the air conditioning on for  months a year so my sticking experience is minimal.  Im reading absorbing and trying to come up with some of the more common issues and environments for sticking but it is taking longer than I anticipated.  But Part  will have some of my own experience that seems to be fairly universal and hopefully helpful.I also want to add that to many people myself included Rement are more than toys or even a hobby its a very positive force that brings pleasure joy and stress relief.  Some may be surprised to learn that there are some hidden aspects to collecting miniatures.  Since a large portion of people discover Rement etc meaning all Asian boxed minis online andor do much of their research and buying online taking and sharing photos is an early activity for many.  But did you realize that organizing storing and all things related is also a very important part of Rement etc for many people?  Not just because you dont want to have tons of mini things floating all over your house but its an integral part of the whole experience to many.  The debates on if you should organize by collection or by type all pans together all drinks together all deserts together you get the idea or other ways are fun to read.  Some people will go back and forth from one system to the other and back again!  Theyre either masochists or really enjoy organizing.    Renatta started her Checklist so that she could go from one organization style to the other if she ever chose too.  She makes a photo of every single set with every single piece visible as an inventory in case she ever decides to organize differently or has mixed up some for what ever reason.  There is actually a group on Flickr that is all about storage and organization of your minis dolls and similar items.  Depending on your own life you may embrace the organization side or think everyone is crazy.  D   What to Store Your Stuff InThere are many many options and they fit many many budgets.  In my opinion a mixture of ziplock bags and hard plastic containers is a very good way to go.  Its the plastic to plastic reaction that often makes your minis melt and stick to things and each other.  But ziplock bags and super hard clear acrylic seem to have fewer reactions than many other plastics or other storage options.  You may still get some sticking and a random melt but it is less likely.   Many people will use small snack or sandwich size ziplock bags for each individual set in a collection and then place all of those smaller bags into a larger say a gallon size ziplock bag and include either a box or a printed paper of that collection.  Simple easy cheap.  One of the great parts of doing this is the low price point so if you ever decide to upgrade your storage in the future you wont feel bad about having already bought a million ziplocks.  I highly recommended finding super tiny ittybitty ziplocks for super organizing.  Ebay has tons of them in many many different sizes and they are very affordable.  I probably have at least  different sizes ranging from  inch x  inch to the large gallon sizes.  But the vast majority are  x  and smaller.  Even though I put a large portion of my collection into hard acrylic containers some pieces are also inside smaller acrylic boxes andor tiny ziplock bags.  Not only will these help reduce sticking its also an extra layer of protection for some of the more delicate pieces.  You may also be less likely to loose those really teeny tiny pieces.  I place super small items into an appropriate size ziplock then place that ziplock inside a larger ziplock think of a tiny item in a  x  bag then in a   x   bag.  Its much harder to loose things that way.  It can also keep multiple parts for a single piece together think keeping all the gumballs from American Kitchen gumball machine together.   Throughout my years of collecting Ive changed basic storage techniques so if you look through my containers you will find a few where almost every single piece is in its own bag inside my acrylic organizer.  Other collections may only have a handful of the soft plastic pieces see Part  in tiny ziplocks and more items especially super hard pieces with little paint are kept loose.   Super hard clear acrylic.  Ah my precious clear acrylic.  Acrylic seems to have very few reactions to Rement etc and while there doesnt seem to be any perfect options for those handful of super sticky items acrylic is one of your better options for your whole collection.  There may still be a very small amount of sticking from a small handful of items but usually everything seems to be ok with little to no permanent damage.I LOVE these kinds of organizers!  I have tons of them and I want more.  But often the really good acrylic organizers are incredibly expensive.  Some of the most badass makeup organizers with several drawers and dividers are easily over  each!  They are on my after I win the lottery list.  You wont have to pay that much for most organizers although you could if you wanted too but most acrylic is still kind of pricy.  Those shown by MsTambo and in my own separate post of my own collection are generally about  each at The Container Store.  I can often get two or three collections in each container with  compartments.  I personally buy one or two a month even if I really dont need one at the moment because its always good to have some on hand when you luck out and win that awesome vintage Rement collection.  If you think about it  of storage cost for each collection really isnt that much and that is for two collections per container.  If you can manage to fit three collections per container which is much easier now with an average of  sets per collection vs the old  sets each its only  per collection.  You do NOT need to spend that much although I personally think protecting the huge investment that is Rement etc is worth it there are other organizers around for less that are still the good hard acrylic.  In my separate post I show my second favorite acrylic organizers the BoxBox often around  each great for organizing lots of small items but they are very short only  high.  If you are lucky you can find others cheaper still.  Walmart used to have some small acrylic organizers in their crafting section they were kind of small and a lot of items had to be stored in larger organizers but for about ish they were great.  For my own collecting they were just a little too small and only had  compartments each I found myself frustrated when using them compared to my precious Container Store organizers plus Im not sure the quality of the acrylic was up to the standards of my other organizers.  If you want to use tissue or tissue paper to wrap your items in make sure you test test test!  It may work for some but personally it was bad for me.  I wrapped some of my precious square watermelons from Mimo in tissue to protect them from sticking to each other and my acrylic container def one of those sticky soft plastic types even with my AC going strong.  It backfired.  I had little bits of tissue stuck all over my melons!  Fortunately when I gently washed them the paper came off but it made me hesitant to try again.  I wonder if wax paper would be better or also sticky?  Or possibly acidfree archive type tissue paper?  The possibilities are endless.  In my experience and in my some of my reading a combination of ziplock bags and quality clear acrylic organizers will help with most stickiness you may encounter.  There are absolutely other options and I hope everyone will share their experience because Im always up for some good storage discussions!  Some people have basic containers with adjustable dividers to make different sized sections and have little to no issue with sticking.  Others do what I mentioned near the top they throw everything in one set or even the whole collection into a single large ziplock bag and have minimal sticking although they may have more breakage andor a higher loss of pieces.  As I said before its a complex issue and your mileage may vary.  And despite what my ego thinks I am not an expert on every aspect of Rement.  So test things when trying new methods of storage.  Then share your experience here with us.One key thing to remember its not like every single piece sticks to everything it comes near especially outside of warm and humid areas.  It is generally considered more prevalent in the older collections than those of the last couple years but you still have to be vigilant with newer collections!  That soft plastic is the primary thing to keep an eye out for.  And as I said elsewhere a couple of the very recent Hello Kitty collections had several of the soft plastic items see Part  and probably other collections as well.  Use common sense and good judgment when deciding how to store your items.  TEST!  If you are unsure if an item is soft use a tiny ziplock and ask questions here.  Better to err on the side of caution than cry over melted Rement. ,rement,clzducc,2,t5_2w8i8
