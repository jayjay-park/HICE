Iriduim though is really expensive and SPOT is only moderately expensive compared to taking advantage of the APRS network requires HAM license or line of sight communications.If you can survive on line of sight communications not going high not a lot of wind and decent confidence in prediction software recommended that opens up a whole new cheaper world of possibilities on the  MHz band which also does not require a license to operate on and has plenty of COTS products that can be taken advantage of. Though if you dont already any radio hardware I dont see this coming in under  either.,hab,d6rgckk,3,t5_2tfh4
