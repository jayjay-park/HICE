575072,0,t1_cg5kasr,Take the battery off and shove as much of a napkin in the battery connector as you can. Take it out. Shove another piece of napkin into the clearomizer connecter and then blow through the mouth piece until you stop hearing the juice. Reattach the battery and clearomizer and take the mouth piece off. Wash off the mouth piece and use a QTip to clean the inside of the mouth piece and where it connects on the inside of the clearomizer. Reattach and vape on.Its annoying but thats the only way Ive found to stop the gurgling.  Ive also found that it helps if you dont turn the vape upside down and not take long draws.

1055397,0,t3_266s7k,If that is what I think it is then the coil inside of that tank is going to go out in a few days.  Get something like a pro tank  mini or a Kanger T as a replacement instead of just getting another one of those disposables.  Get some spare coils for it so you dont find yourself stranded at am with no nicotine.  T coils are  if you order online.  They last me longer than the tank that you have lasted me.A simple rinse and dry works for me.  I use a paper towels to dry the wicks.,E_Cigarette,cho94rv,2,t5_2u9gi

1522418,0,t1_cj73ci6,Ah. Makes sense. I was wondering what happened because i had been vaping for a good while at .. One more question if you have any knowledge at all about it. I was looking into getting a better tank that goes well with the mvp. Im interested in getting really good flavor with a good amount of vapor behind it. From what Ive been told at the vape shop a kayfun gives real good flavor because its a rebuildable. But looking up different kinds of tanks like that aqua and kayfun and fogger Im not sure which one will fit my purpose better. You have any suggestions?,E_Cigarette,cj741yt,2,t5_2u9gi
1639543,0,t3_2cvcop,I would decide on what setup you want first then shop for it. If you want a ego style the Kanger Evod kit is a great deal. Can be found for under .

1790512,0,t1_ck4sytg,I think after reading what you had to say about these  items together and what Ive read in reviews on both I think I have found a setup that will work for me and my budget. I love vaping. Ive havent had a cigarette in over a year and half and no nicotine for over a year. I started vaping with nic and the slowly dropped the level on it until it was none. Ive had crazy cravings for a cigarette for the past month and this is way its important to find a new setup. So thank you for your time and suggestions!,E_Cigarette,ck4ufsp,1,t5_2u9gi

1922711,0,t3_2gnp21,NicQuid has a few peach flavors that are really good too if youre on a budget or want to get a smaller bottle to sample before buying a whole ml. Theyve got one that is just peach and another that is called southern freeze which is peaches strawberries and a mild menthol exhale. I think theres one more but I cant remember for sure. Southern freeze is awesome though the strawberry is actually very mild its mostly the peach that you can taste. Worth trying at least once in my opinion.,E_Cigarette,ckkvfvu,1,t5_2u9gi
