4550228,0,t1_cszq5yn,I do have support. I had to uproot my home and move back with my family but its very nice having them to lean on. He tells me hes seen three therapists and hopefully he will continue to see one but he is certainly a more bitter person than before and it doesnt seem like that will change soon. Thank you for your message. I dont want to be a victim and Im trying hard not to feel like one. ,emotionalabuse,ct46hbz,1,t5_2w5ga
6558367,0,t1_czwra91,Thank you so much! This post is super helpful in understanding myself! Ive actually been adopting traits I want to see in myself. One is being more social and outgoing. Im trying to make more friends at school and be more involved on campus. Im very involved on campus now and starting to become more social. I find I can get kind of exhausted when I think about hanging out with people but once I actually hang out I feel happy. Youre right I need to forget about the things my ex said to me. Also I left my relationship and I knew what he was doing wasnt right. So I can trust myself. Also I need to realize my feelings are valid. I will remember the  month mark! I think this makes a lot of sense. I become friends with this girl over the summer and when I first met her I had this feeling that she was the type of girl to put her romantic relationship first but because I liked her so much I kind of gave her the benefit of the doubt. When she got in a new relationship she stopped spending time with me. Blaming my behaviour as the reason our friendship has fallen apart. Now looking back I can see people show who you are in small ways and certain behaviours. I still love my friend but I wish I remembered my first thoughts when this friendship fell apart. Thanks again! Youve been super helpful. Its nice to talk to someone whos been through something similar. ,emotionalabuse,czxotsd,2,t5_2w5ga

8431232,0,t1_d5vfnlu,Im sorry.  i didnt mean to imply that it was your fault.  Do you trust your family?  If so you can rely on them for emotional support.  You can tell them what happened.Unexplained weight loss is a sign of HIV.  I strongly recommend that you make an emergency appointment to see a doctor.  ,emotionalabuse,d5vg0wz,1,t5_2w5ga
9172135,0,t3_55xlwp,gtTomorrow Im going to my therapist who Ive been with for years and I just dont know how to bring this up or if I even want to.Do it.  This is someone who knows you fairly well or so I assume.  As to how you should do it start right in the beginning of your session by saying that somethings been bothering you.  This is more important than whatever else youve been working on.  In fact I assume youve been seeing her for feelings of anxiety guilt and depression which are causes in no small part by the abuse you have suffered.  In other words theres a chance that this is the problem shes been trying to help you with without realizing it.  gtI think what it really comes down to is that I dont want to think this is true. I dont want to end this relationship. Im not ready to walk away and be done.Your therapist wont pressure you but I will.  It is almost never a good idea to stay in an abusive relationship.  ,emotionalabuse,d8emws3,3,t5_2w5ga
9177588,0,t3_55sld0,Go to your college for help  the counseling center should have good relationships with other resource offices on campus and would know how to help you  and look at the welfare website for your area. Its time for you to get on the waiting list for section  housing maybe. The police should also have resources to help. Good on you for making good grades and dont worry about your coherence. Its very very understandable. You reached out for help on how to reach out for help. Youre obviously bright and strong. You can do this!,emotionalabuse,d8fbrcn,2,t5_2w5ga
9660293,0,t1_da3tbgc,Thanks for your response. Im so happy you found a loving relationship! Although I am content alone Ive always been a hopeless romantic and almost fear that Im going to get too comfortable. I also worry that in my late s all the good men are off the market already.Can you tell me what it feels like to be with a stable man? Im worried I wont recognized it when I see it and will pass it up. I also worry that theres something Im doing thats turning those men away.,emotionalabuse,da3u0gl,1,t5_2w5ga
10104212,0,t1_dbo7e7p,She takes care of him in every other wayat least on this trip I cant say for home She makes sure he is fed and dressed nicely and always clean. The only other thing that bothers me is that she is in a certain business that requires her to leave her child with a sitter from PMAM. Because of her profession shes always has different men in the house around J I sometimes hope she gets arrested because everyone she knows has our number and that little boy would end up here!,emotionalabuse,dbol9zv,1,t5_2w5ga
10262940,0,t1_dc0ptzz,Thanks for your reply. I am trying to build up resilience but its so difficult at times. I had a few okay days whereas today feels like a setback. When I get like this I feel paralysed the feeling is so heavy. ,emotionalabuse,dc7cz2d,2,t5_2w5ga
10669671,0,t3_5sjm3r,That definitely sounds like a toxic relationship and you didnt deserve to be treated that way,emotionalabuse,ddghuux,3,t5_2w5ga
11731835,0,t3_5t4wqg,If he ever makes you feel not good enough belittled weak unloveable stupid anything less than a human being shouldfeel. Leave. Its not love. Its control. ,emotionalabuse,dgpu12z,1,t5_2w5ga
11758710,0,t3_67r62p,Sweetie you know this isnt healthy behaviour. Hes using the trust issues to control you. You have never given him a legit reason to not trust you so why should you be treated as such? Him saying other people think its weird for you to hang out with guy friends is just a tactic abusers use to try to make you feel bad. Edit to add the term I was looking for was gaslighting. ,emotionalabuse,dgsvoaw,2,t5_2w5ga
