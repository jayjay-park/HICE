2525997,0,t1_cmo5x2h,Must be nice everything is a bit frozen here. Though on the other hand I dont think I could handle the heat well in the Texas summer The tincture seems relatively simple see if I have this right. I dry the conks and grind them into powder  for this I have a hand mill for grinding grains do you think that would work? Then I pour  proof alcohol over it and leave it for two weeks. Then I strain it into a bottle and put the powder mass in water and I cook for an hour just below boiling strain and add new water simmer for another hour and then strain and simmer the water until you have as much water as you do alcohol. Then you mix the two and you should have everything of value from the conk and the  alcohol in the tincture keeps it from going bad.That is all from reading everything I can find on the subject. How close am I?,sporetraders,cmoa9af,1,t5_2wuum

3316826,0,t1_cp6c74p,gt Arent we being overly paranoid to think that the police would spend their time trying to entrap people on the internet? I wrapped my house and router in tin foil to keep them out of my EMF waves. gtSeems like such a waste of time and a piss poor tactic at achieving any results.I work for the government as a contractor wasting time and especially money is about the only thing that I would say they are good at. gtIts the same as thinking that the police would entrap someone on craigslist in a drug deal. Im sure if some idiot posts an ad on the internet to sell a drug and the police monitor that site Im sure they would try and bustLike they dont use Instagram and other social media to bust folks right?gtI dont think that there any localcity police operations dedicated to the mushroom grower. This mentality has lead to many arrests surely.gtMaybe the DEA has a team that monitors Reddit or the shroomery and traces our IP back from comments posted all to stop the insidious mushroom grower.  Id wager a large sum of money to say that there is at least some form of harvesting going on in these communities online and should a need ever arise or any other evidence come into question these would surely be investigated. gtI also think that its the last thing on that list to be worried about from just about everyones perspective. Mushrooms arent connected to violence like other drugs like cocaine heroin pretty much all of them actually even weed.See my last statement about folks getting caught.gtBut shit Im more worried about having my Amazon shopping history leaked or sold to authorities than anything else. Id have some serious explaining to do. These are legitimate purchases as someone who grows gourmet mushrooms there is nothing illegal about that OPSEC should be taken seriously. Act like they are watching and you wont make mistakes that could lead to catastrophic failures.OPSEC is something I think many of the folks in this community take for granted but I am happily posting from the comfort of wherever the fuck I wish because of what some might call paranoia. I think a healthy dose of paranoia is good for anyone involved in anything which could be perceived as illegal otherwise thats just plain arrogance in my opinion. rant,sporetraders,cp6cgxd,1,t5_2wuum

6226440,0,t3_40uyw2,David Bowie was my favourite artist. Still is. When I found out he was dead I cried so much that my cat was worried about me and gave me cuddles to comfort me. Last year in September I went to a David Bowie exhibition. It had all his costumes that he wore and some of his music videos playing. It had handwritten song lyrics. It had some of his personal items and it even had his cocaine spoon. It was the most wonderful exhibition I ever went to. Until then I had never seen the music video of Life on Mars? though I had listened to the song many many times. I just stood there mesmerised by it. It felt like he was personally singing it to me. My favourite video game is Omikron the nomad soul David Bowie was in that game as  different characters and he wrote the album Hours... for that game. After I ran out of tears from his death I decided to celebrate his life rather than be sad about his death and since then have been listening to near nonstop David Bowie music. ,sporetraders,cyxdmyn,2,t5_2wuum

7433805,0,t3_4gy55b,Id say my favorite is the Bullet Ant because it has the most powerful bite. A bite from the Bullet Ant has been compared to a gunshot and is the most painful insect bite known to man. Its a very interesting insect with history of cultural use.The SaterMaw people of Brazil use intentional bullet ant stings as part of their initiation rites to become a warrior. The ants are first rendered unconscious by submerging them in a natural sedative and then hundreds of them are woven into a glove made of leaves which resembles a large oven mitt stingers facing inward. When the ants regain consciousness a boy slips the glove onto his hand. The goal of this initiation rite is to keep the glove on for a full  minutes. When finished the boys hand and part of his arm are temporarily paralyzed because of the ant venom and he may shake uncontrollably for days. The only protection provided is a coating of charcoal on the hands supposedly to confuse the ants and inhibit their stinging. To fully complete the initiation however the boys must go through the ordeal a total of  times over the course of several months or even years. ,sporetraders,d2n6cy8,1,t5_2wuum
