I ended up selling mine to a place called PCNet If you have the box driver discs manual etc. be sure to bring them as they increase the value.  One thing to be aware of is that if the installation language of the OS andor the keyboard layout arent Japanese that can be a cause for significant loss in value.

Its more important that you book at least a month in advance but not so far in advance that the hotels havent posted their inventory. For hostels I gather its different  months in advance.Having been stuck in a smoking room in Las Vegas once Id do a lot to avoid having to stay two weeks in a smelly hotel room. Maybe the Japanese hotel wouldnt be as bad but I personally wouldnt want to take that risk.Ks House Tokyo Oasis looks to be a  minute walk from three different stations or you can take the Tsukuba Express at the station  minutes away but youll have to transfer if youre going anywhere other than Ueno or Akihabara.

Historically the Japanese tea ceremony has revolved around the preparation of this tea. These days matcha is used in a number of ways  from cooking applications in ice cream and mochi to drinking applications to classic Japanese tea ceremonies.True Japanese matcha  or tencha as it is called more specifically  is made from the delicate shadegrown tea leaves used to make Gyokuro tea. The tea trees are covered in cloth to protect the leaves from light during the several week period before harvest. This process forces the plant to produce more chlorophyll increases the production of amino acids and gives the leaves a very dark rich shade of green. The leaves are then delicately handpicked and laid flat to dry if they were rolled they would become Gyokuru tea. At this point the leaves are deveined destemmed and finely ground into a powder which is then called tencha. This highgrade tencha has an intense sweetness and round richness that is unparalleled. Tencha is the only tea that qualifies as true matcha in Japan despite the fact that most matcha sold in the United States is not tencha.So then what have you been buying all this time? Because of the extremely high cost of producing tencha many tea suppliers and retailers have been marketing ground sencha as matcha. Sencha is a beautiful Japanese green tea that is bright vegetal and grassy. The buds and broken leaves of the sencha tea are ground into a powder to make a lessexpensive matchalike tea. Technically this type of tea is known as konacha literally powdered tea. Powdered sencha is quite a bit more intense in flavor than tencha and can have a rather tannic and astringent finish.From Hope that helps! Not that matcha tencha isnt delicious and amazing but it isnt the same as what you at the sushi places though that is also delicious of course!,Tokyo,d47er48,2,t5_2r812

If I live near Shinjuku I pay more for space and company pay less in commuting fee. What Im doing really is just shifting expenditure to the company to pay more for commuting fee.Japan doesnt like work from home so big companies should instead rent small offices through out the city kinda like how franchise shops have shops every where.
