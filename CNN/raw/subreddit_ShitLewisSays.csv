4567555,0,t3_3djdqd,As I read the comments I feel the need to explain why Ive posted this.If we look at all the Shit Lewis says he is rarely COMPLETELY wrong. Almost all of the time he is partially correct in his knowledge but many times one part of the sentence is completely BS. In this case it was the Neuter part which he called Durr  ,ShitLewisSays,ct6cqea,0,t5_30zzo

9771344,0,t1_dahisg0,It is pretty much just him stuttering yeah but the way he said it came off as quite strange and shit at least to me and I thought it was pretty funny.I dont see your point about how Are there locked chests? No chests are locked to you Sjin isnt a strange thing to say matters at all to the discussion because thats not what he said. Working on that logic How big can you eat stuff? is not appropriate for the sub because what he meant to say I want you to eat something really big. isnt strange at all. Given that that post has  points is in the top posts of all time and has become one of the most frequently referenced posts on the sub I think most people would say that it is a Shit Lewis Says moment.Lots of other popular posts on this sub are also just incomplete grammatically incorrect and stuttered sentences For instance these posts have  points  points  points  points  points and  points and in the top posts of all time at the moment I post this. Ive never really seen any complaint made about these posts either. So it seems to me that the community enjoys them. The mods also dont seem to have ever made a rule against or discouraged posts like this. As far as Im concerned thats enough of a reason to let it stand.,ShitLewisSays,dahj91p,3,t5_30zzo
