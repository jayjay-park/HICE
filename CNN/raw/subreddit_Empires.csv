10697349,0,t1_ddiz4fr,I agree however there is a problem with that.Since people are volunteers it cant be dictated what people work on. Then we also get people who start their own projects and never finish it and let people know how far they got so they can pick it up later. Its a mess. I want more structure and organization but you cant force a volunteer to do something they dont want to. ,Empires,ddjcoir,1,t5_2ryzr
