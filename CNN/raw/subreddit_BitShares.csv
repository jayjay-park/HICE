647895,0,t3_21cui5,i feel like this is the biggest threat to bitcoin yet. If this is successful it will basically put all cryptos on equal playing field... it presents the same sort of threat that bing videos presented to youtube. And while that is a good thing for the ecosystem i still hope being a btc holder and all that btcs first mover advantage and network effect make it as resilient as youtube was.,BitShares,cgdwzeu,1,t5_2ykpf

1554023,0,t3_2c0qvm,For the lazy  gtQuote from toast on Today at  AM  There are a million other things to do  So youre saying you dont have the resources to do this? This is the exact opposite sentiment to what I was reading in the multiple discussion threads started by I above.  gtQuote from toast on Today at  AM  we need a POW difficulty update for PTS in either case  The POW difficulty update is not the only issue. What about the low hash rate and the fact that many of the miners are only mining for altruistic reasons. The current situation is insecure and inefficient and the matter was discussed in painstaking detail with the community and resolved. The idea that I would make a backdoor decision after all this is just astonishing to me.  gtQuote from toast on Today at  AM  we dont want to put all our eggs into one basket while DPOS so young.  Im sorry but this statement is utterly illogical. BTSX currently has  times the market cap of Bitshares PTS. Are you claiming that it is Is strategy to diversify across multiple consensus algorithms just in case DPOS fails? Why not tell our DAC developers to do the same  one can create X Scrypt SHA Nxt etc. The fact is that everyone in this ecosystem has knowingly put their eggs into this one basket DPOS. The entire point of buying PTS or AGS is to be solely in this one basket of DPOS.  gtQuote from toast on Today at  AM  What makes you so concerned about it?  backroom decision making OPPOSITE to the community consensus  scatterbrained and illogical answers when consulted  The fact that some PTS whales dumped and crashed the price almost immediately after this backroom decision was made.  Is that enough for you?,BitShares,cjb2jho,1,t5_2ykpf

1993929,0,t1_ckswd1z,gt The market peg stays stable by people betting for arbitragespeculationhedging on both sides of the real USD price.So basically its a gambling game? And only as long as people enjoy the gambling itll work?   How is the share of winners vs. losers? Does it equal out? gt Even with a small volume thus far in beta testing the peg has held very well.Are you sure? Ive read the price was slipping on the exchanges at first. And then basically the programmer went in stopped the markets  to add artificial buy walls and price feeds.   So if it is working then not just because of the gambling.gt The combination of a cryptocurrency that can rise exponentially BTSX with a marketpegged currency given its value by the free market BitUSD and other assets is extremely powerful.Im still trying to learn... but for all I see Its powerful but extremely risky.

2025345,0,t1_ckwa5um,The Bitcoin community is mostly filled with people who blindly believe in ProofofWork and believe that other consensus technologies are insecure or undesirable for other reasons. If you create a DAC secured by DPOS and give  to BTC holders there is a good chance that the vast majority will dump it to extract whatever profits they can from it. This will have an effect opposite to the one you were hoping for the inappropriate sharedrop would reduce the likelihood of success for the DAC rather than increase it because the dump will hurt the initial market cap of the DAC and thus the purchasing power of the founders who lets say held the other  and their ability to fund initial development.It makes more sense to use that  for an IPO to raise the initial capital needed to fund the development and marketing of the DAC. The IPO will selfselect the people that believe in the vision of the project. With this approach you both get a good sum of money to pay for initial development and you allocate initial shares to strong hands.,BitShares,ckx9j30,1,t5_2ykpf
2063471,0,t1_cl23gjf,Thanks.  Id like to see every bitshares investor to be someone who has investigated and intelligently analyzed the system and decided to invest in BTSX because of its worthiness.  Not head in the sand religious zealots. Either Bitshares is a workable solution to how to create an entire financial ecosystem within crypto not just a currency but also banking stocks bonds financial derivatives etc and we should invest in it.  Or its not and we should avoid it.  It is up to each potential investor to determine if it could work and make a rational investment choice.,BitShares,cl24224,4,t5_2ykpf
2610322,0,t3_2pefaa,An important take away from all this is that while many complained about the marketing effort for many many months MethodX stepped up and actually did something about it. This has inspired a lot of good people to rally behind him and start to produce as well.

Full delegates receive the max  and are either using the funds to help build up bitshares through marketing for instance or are taking it as a salary to work on development.,BitShares,cphziuu,2,t5_2ykpf
5048893,0,t3_3jxtox, bytemaster I will try to say this cleanly. Vitalik saying they could theoretically do  TPS is a theoretical assumption based upon implementing complex algorithms for dividing up the transaction workload among multiple nodes so that not all nodes have to process all transactions. All of his whitepapers on the subject involve dividing up the work among multiple nodes. What we have done with our numbers are the amount that can be processed by a single node and not theoretically the numbers we published are actual benchmark results based on average computers today. not only that the published number of  transactions per second is scaled down from our actual benchmark result of  transactions per second which itself was based upon average hardware and not high end hardware. So with high end hardware we could easily do over  TPS and thats before we have done any optimizations whatsoever to the performance. Most optimizations can easily double or triple the throughput once we eliminate the bottlenecks we have left by better memory management and allocation strategies. There are a lots of little things we could do to improve performance above and beyond that. So I would say that if youre going to compare apples to apples you would have to compare theoretically how much can each of our systems do in a single thread. bytemaster So in a single thread I believe we can get to  transactions per second maybe  million transactions per second once we have all of the optimizations in place leaving network bandwidth to be the primary motivator for not scaling that high. Thats on a single thread.,BitShares,cuukzo1,2,t5_2ykpf

The system has gone successfully through the great stresstest which renders BitShares blockchain platform more like VISA and MasterCard combined or even greater. OpenLedger is hiring country ambassadors in different parts of the world. Some of them have already joined. Russians are making wide adoption for the platform in their area with fiat gateway to bitRUB.According to BitShares weekly State of the Network reports bloggersclub on Steemit is Ronny Boesing the CEO of OpenLedger which is enough to be official isnt it? Also the official OpenLedger blog was provided as a source same for the official Telegram channel ushumbalar please join and stay tuned you may be interested as an early adopter and you may use it as an opportunity of an early peek if you believe in the project.,BitShares,dgy80xm,1,t5_2ykpf
