3507884,0,t1_cps02u6,I have a T or something. A  machine from China.Im using the stock board and just have an Arduino Uno running GRBL plugged into the parallel port. No worrying about jitter this way.I plan on making some lithographic plates out of white acrylic sheets to make a lampshade out of. I suppose Ill use BlenderD for that. For the PCBs I have played with Kicad and pcbgcode but I havent had much success with the latter.Id also like to replace my cracked Prusa i body plate but thatll take some time measuring and laying out to replicate. Also my  is called a  because the deck has cm by cm of working space which isnt large enough for an i body so Ill have to make it in two halves and i dunno screw them together somehow.Ill also be using it in conjunction with my i to make a new instrument cluster enclosure for one of my motorcycles. Itll house a banana pi or similar an arduino a rats nest of jumper wires probably and a  LCD. With any luck itll look good work well and pass inspection. Who knows?,hobbycnc,cps4gu3,1,t5_37edg

4685714,0,t1_ctl2sx8,I totally get that.  Wanting to save the money.  ampnbsp   On the gantry Im learning to use it for cutting decorative designs into wood and engraving.  Plaques wooden models etc.  Learning the CNC aspect of it has been pretty cool and I would definitely recommend that.  ampnbsp  The X clone though its mostly just for fun.  Picked it up when harbor freight had a  off sale over the th of july for .  I dont have any hands on experience with the G but I can definitely say that the X probably wont do what you want it to without some serious modifications.    ampnbsp  On mine the stock rotating column on has a good  thou play in it.  The lead screw nuts are poorly threaded and the way they attach to the table is comical at best.  Without loctite the thing will shake itself to pieces pretty quickly.  The motor is connected to the spindle by plastic gears that apparently break very easily.  And of course the motor itself isnt particularly powerful either.  And as far as I can tell mine seems to be in better shape than quite a few that people have received.  ampnbsp  Having said all that Ive actually had a lot of fun pulling the thing apart and am in the process of tweaking and fixing it up to the point where its a proper mill.  I just wouldnt recommend one if you want to get down to business.  Hopefully that BF is a lot better just you know do your best to learn why or why not for yourself.  Spending some time with a cheapo starter machine can help a lot when it comes time to buy a machine that needs to do a particular job.,hobbycnc,ctl6h0b,1,t5_37edg

5469180,0,t1_cwapw89,I think the the glowforge software is dumbed down to make it easy for the masses.  Cloud based which I dont like. Epilog has a driver plugin for adobe illustratorcoral draw.  Just import drawing modify and hit print to laser.  Pretty easy to use in my opinion.  Full spectrum also includes a illustratorcoreldraw plug in too. I guess one can download the plugin and see if it is easy to use. Im more familiar with gcode and have a few CNC machines already. I will just use the same software I use to generate gcode for my modified Kramps laser.  ,hobbycnc,cwaqmsf,1,t5_37edg

6508587,0,t3_44s6oz,. What sort of projects do you intend to use it for? Cutting plastic wood aluminum titanium? Making something the size you want to cut wood and plastics can be done. You actually have many options here.. You will likely have to engineer your own enclosure and this is where it would get interesting. CNC routers tend to be very loud machines. You can have a quieter watercooled spindle but it will still be very very loud when cutting. People have come up with interesting enclosures that you can find by googling around. Still I dont think I would be comfortable using one in an apartment Brooklyn here. I dont have a sound deadening enclosure but I cant stand being in the basement when it is running for a prolonged period of time wearing ear plugs and cans.,hobbycnc,czsjd3g,1,t5_37edg

7219099,0,t1_d1yqgne,At rpm you will get ipm with  reduction and tpi. Ive changed out bad encoders before.  I like to use USdigital ones for about . Dont let a bad encoder worry you to much.  Do test the motor with a volt power supply.  Make sure in spins smoothly both ways with no crunching ball bearing sound. Regarding the Mesa stuff you really need to call them since they carry a shit ton of interface cards.  They will tell you what you need.  With  reduction you will get x more motor continuous torque or approximately ozin continuous.  I dont know if that is enough to move such a heavy table on a Bridgeport. Please check on that before you begin.  Do not use peak torque ratings to figure this out.  Peak ratings are only good for a few seconds. Anymore and you will overheatburn out the motor. ,hobbycnc,d1yr8av,1,t5_37edg

8684567,0,t1_d6q45ly,I reinstalled mach with the parallel drivers which appears to have resolved it for some reason Im not sure why one cnc would work and the other wouldnt but here we are.New issue!I tuned the servos as best I could by ear and am moving all axiss I ran a quick test part  hss cutter rpm ipm . docAfter discovering this I tried cutting some air when I increased the feed rate the x and Y axis motors will jump ahead around  times per second and this extra movement appears to be unaccounted for by the driver so the job wanders off.  This only happened when I increased speed when cutting air so Im wondering if my previous screwing around with pulses up to u now may be not the best idea now that I got the thing working.I didnt hear the belt slipping when the above job was running and they are very snug so Id very likely hear it so I assume this is what is happening since servos cant? lose steps.  the cutter might be a little dull but It didnt sound that aggressive and chips look good.Any thought here pubs?  Im not sure where to make the adjustments the holding torque on the servos is still really good more than I could do by hand and I could cut this aggressively by hand and the axis not being driven appears to be rock solid during the cuts,hobbycnc,d6r73fr,1,t5_37edg
8939763,0,t1_d7k4prh,In my ideal world we would move away from sculptures renders and standalone printscuts. Instead you would have an index of projects searchable by what tools you have and the capabilities of your tools. Only things that have actually been created would be in the list no renders or hypothetical creations. And things like the a d printer or laser cutter or cnc router would just be one tool that could be used to make some of the pieces.For example the book scanners I make use Tslot construction lasercut metal plates CNC routed plastic plates waterjet GFR plates D printed end caps CNCground glass panes acrylic painted mirrors etc. This is a pretty complicated kind of project with a lot of different tools or subcontracting to people who have the tools required. But almost every interesting project more complicated than a sign or a sculpture requires multiple tools and different parts that you assemble together.Id love to have a site where I could say I have a d printer that can make  x  x  and a drill press and a mitre saw and find out what I can make with those tools. And if Im considering getting a CNC that cuts up to  x  what else could I make with it?,hobbycnc,d7mfehn,1,t5_37edg

9100435,0,t1_d85iho3,Roughed with a  flat end mill. Finished with a  ball nose. Roughing step over was .mm and I left a half mm I think for the finishing op. I cant remember my finishing step over right offhand but I will check the header of the g code when I get home. .mm sticks out in my head. I was also going to finish from the perpendicular direction as well but decided it wasnt necessary so I stopped it when it started that portion of it. Finishing was done at either  or mmm again I cant remember which. ,hobbycnc,d85q572,2,t5_37edg
