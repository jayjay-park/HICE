3227986,0,t3_2wjcx1,A  Rhm and Himmler were two incredibly different individual Rhm was as tough as a coffin nail. Rhm was severely wounded during WW and carried the scars until his death.  Rhm contracted Spanish Flu during the postWW outbreak this outbreak BTW killed . to . billion people! and survived.  Subsequent to WW Rhm was an officer in the German Army which was reduced to . million men  which meant that only the absolute BEST officers served.  He worked with Hitlers NSAP until  then between  to  he fought in Bolivia as a Mercenary.  His dream was to integrate the SA and the Army and become overall commander of Germanys armed forces.  He was in this writers NSHO probably wholly loyal to Hitler.  He was incredibly tough and an excellent fighter with fist or blade or gun.  He was also utterly unsubtle.  He was gay but uncloseted at a time when to be openly homosexual was incredibly dangerous.  Rhm to put it crudely didnt give a fuck.  I imagine if you tried to call this guy queer youd be picking up your teeth with broken fingers if you were lucky.  Himmler?  Well Himmler... before he joined the NSDAP and Hitler this man was socially awkward a martyr to stomachache and a weak and unimpressive individual.  His brother was a decorated soldier Himmler spent the postwar period trying to farm chickens.  He had no fighting experience and was physically wholly unimpressive.  He always wanted to be a soldier and in  achieved that ambition.Rhms approach to the army was crude and may be likened to a drunk coarse soldier trying to hire a women as a prostitute.  Himmlers approach was delicate and genteel.Himmler was ultimately to succeed where Rhm failed.  Incidentally he was always to display his weakness of stomach.  While watching an SS Einsaztgruppen murder he vomited and then determined that gassing the undesirables was more seemly.  Not all evil insane monsters are textbook thugs.,SchutzStaffelSS,cowl30a,1,t5_36z7x
