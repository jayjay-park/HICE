461956,0,t3_1z6iwf,I studied abroad in India this past summer BangaloreChrist University and I will say that as somebody who is similar to you whitefemale It is an experience youll loveeven if you hate it while youre there. I spent most of the time there enjoying the different cultural aspects while also absolutely hating that things were slow going and backwards most of the time to me but thats all part of the experience. Keep in mind that most universities there at least the programs I looked and and the one I ultimately went on require that girls wear salwar kameez that youll buy while there. But when not at school youll need to wear either school attire or jeans and a longer shirt. I felt really out of place when I was wearing jeans and tshirts to be honest. Id be happy to answer any other questions you had especially if you end up studying in southern India,IncredibleIndia,cfsrwrr,2,t5_2vlfx
