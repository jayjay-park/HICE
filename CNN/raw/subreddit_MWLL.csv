9559982,0,t1_d9q8tu8,Vlaad did most of the anims sets for the later half of mechs and is the one to ask. But while there is always the need to make a balance to mech bounce as they walkruns and how the fpv camera sits in the cockpit because MWLL doesnt separate fpv from external animation of the mech like MWO does for example if you add move bounce to the mech and it walks would look cool from the outside but in the cockpit your view outside would be like being on a bouncy castle. You can add the camera bone and animate to minmise the bounce of the mech. But it can ony go so far in that respect. However the animations could be run though motion builder and tweeked to add more stompyness and try to capture the weight of mechs. But I dont have the old dev build so cant even make any tests or PoCs to see if I could improve them any more. ,MWLL,d9rgpty,2,t5_2t0pe

10748061,0,t3_5pu4oo,After playing MWLL for a week I feel this is a good suggestion and Im putting off playing  this until the BA issue has been fixed mended stapled or removed.Its bullshit that a BA even though its  BAs can melt through a mech. Youre supposed to be put at a disadvantage as a BA FFS not given an advantage.,MWLL,ddokwmx,2,t5_2t0pe
