3804710,0,t1_cqpykwq,Thats NFCs state in the US. In India Ive yet to see any place with NFC pay support. everyone uses credit cards where they can rest of the time they pay using cash. Lack of NFC doesnt really matter in developing countries. But anyway NFC is usually integrated with the BTWiFi and requires a few extra components so it has almost negligible cost. However Motorola seems to have taken negligible costs into account they didnt include a camera flash!,MotoE,cqpyuak,2,t5_31g3f

5484716,0,t3_3q6yc0,Its cheap I got it for about . The OS is fairly free of bloat but Motorola decided that the phone doesnt get software updates. Its great as a phone to use while you main phone is being repaired but I would go for at least a Moto G if I were to use it as a daily driver.,MotoE,cwcq21x,5,t5_31g3f
5821459,0,t1_cxi78b9,Ive heard that if you boot with the Verizon SIM in it locks it to Verizon. So if you did do that then you may be screwed.,MotoE,cxipvag,1,t5_31g3f

7327617,0,t1_d2avvmf,I think its just these storage permission disabled things now. Other than that its working fine.Quite impressed by the performance. My bluetooth earbuds would crackle if I used other applications when listening to music now theres no dropout. Turning the screen when a video is playing doesnt dropout the sound either.,MotoE,d2b3m5s,1,t5_31g3f

8011626,0,t1_d4ggke5,Factory reset wont work for me. I can get to the screen with the little broken android laying down I press the Power and Volume Up button to get to the next screen and then when I go to select factory reset or any other option for that matter it just goes back into its boot loop,MotoE,d4gkxsf,1,t5_31g3f
8244778,0,t1_d58535v,gt it works well because the rest of the phone is so fastThis but it depends what you expect everybody uses their phone differently.And going from . to . was an obvious boost. I cant really complain about anything right now. Its very smooth for its price.,MotoE,d585if1,1,t5_31g3f

10160298,0,t1_dbvoz1z,I left it on a charger for a while but I think it will be stuck at  forever because when i check its still there. And when I do check then it restarts the bootloop.,MotoE,dbvq5m8,1,t5_31g3f

10457509,0,t3_5pqoc3,Yes you can I have done it myself on an XT. You root just like any other Android phone. First you must unlock the bootloader with an unlock code obtained  here WARNING this will void the warranty. Flash TWRP with fastboot I recommend Squid TWRP instead of the official one. Boot into TWRP and flash the SuperSU zip. It is really hard to brick the device and factory images can be found all over the internet if you need a fresh start. Good luck.,MotoE,dctgp0w,3,t5_31g3f
