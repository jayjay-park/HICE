610919,0,t3_2131mt,Gotta say this author doesnt know jack shit about Ferrari stories. Hes just copied a bunch of popular articles from the last  years. What about the story of where the Ferrari badge comes from? What about Ferraris first world championship?  What about the story of Ferraris CanAm racecar the ? How about some Villeneuve stories?

1563618,0,t1_cjc9de6,Born and raised Calgarian. Its the first  Spider convertible in Western Canada been hoping to run into it for a few months now when it first was delivered to Ferrari of Alberta dealer in town and then was sold. The driver looks like one of the managers at the dealer as well.I have raced many cars in town in my R including the two enzos Ive seen around yellow and red the red is owned by the same man that owns this  Spider and the yellow is of a rich CEO both are very good drivers. I watched them go through and under the train line in bowness at over mph and in my bike I was only comfortable going mph. I know of a F and Diablo thats both wrapped different every summer seemingly. The owner of the shop that wrapped them owns a FXX thats been made street legal and I saw it last year but he didnt want to race me haha. The shop is ZR Auto if you wanna check it out.,Ferrari,cjc9ta7,1,t5_2qhjk

6067015,0,t1_cyej53w,I was thinking the same  Maybe it would look tacky a bit hip. Im keeping the FF at the moment as a practical car to drive around the estate etc... and a tesla roadster for fun.
