6731897,0,t1_d0f3m4y,I find it quite comforting that people tend to forget so quickly. Its better than to get hung up in their heads about the fact that the person theyre talking to has a certain limitation.,MonoHearing,d0fmy5g,2,t5_3ct5z

6739499,0,t3_47zhpf,Lost my left ear hearing at .  I actually hardly even noticed for several years because it just turned normal to me.. Never sat up front in class. Never had problems hearing the teacher.  Even now at  I have no problems hearing from anywhere in a quiet room. I preferred sitting in noisier places to have people on my good side but in school when the teachers did there thing everyone stayed quiet enough to hear from anywhere. I had many hearing tests and my right ear has always been pretty normal. No super hearing or anything. Id doubt the kids problems have anything to do with his hearing unless he has below average hearing in his working ear. ,MonoHearing,d0gf7jw,3,t5_3ct5z

6842914,0,t3_48z7bd,Normally I have a pretty good sense of balance however sometimes I get dizzy and my head spins around for a few seconds. Usually its just a minor annoyance but about a month ago it was so bad that I fell on the floor and got a mean cut on my jaw,MonoHearing,d0ry77r,1,t5_3ct5z
8140790,0,t1_d4utr1n,Yeah my BAHA can come loose on occasion if Im running around too hard or something knocks it off. My doctor recommended I take it off for races when I used to run races so probably not sturdy at all enough for a firefighter,MonoHearing,d4v5764,1,t5_3ct5z
