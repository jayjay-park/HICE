10286481,0,t3_5n88lc,Jeremy on this subject last year I dont want violence I dont want killing I dont want all the horrors that go with itYes I did make myself very unpopular with some people by a preparedness to reach out to the Republican tradition in Ireland to say ultimately this war is unwinnable by either side there is never going to be a military answer  therefore there has to be a political dialogue.At the same time secretly the British government was also engaged in that and then eventually in  we got the first ceasefire.Good intentions ,Labour,dca121o,4,t5_2qjin
10354673,0,t1_dchhsxv,Lisa Nandy Virtually unknown had to google her. She was cochair of Owen Smiths campaign team which will put alot of people of from the start. What does she stand for? Her parliamentary record makes her look like a fairly bland New Labour bot. She voted for the no fly zone in Libya that allowed the west to destroy Gaddafis defenses and let the terrorists take over.Kier Starmer as we have already discussed was one of those most responsible for Labours failure to oppose the snoopers charter as he was leading the negotiations. He also campaigned for Owen Smith while his own CLP was for Corbyn. He is also a virtual unknown but is off to a bad start.So that leaves Clive Lewis the third virtual unknown. Hes the best option so far in my opinion but he still has a long way to go to prove himself.,Labour,dchrgtp,2,t5_2qjin

We dont need to remind people about taxes we need new forms of ownership or we will we be right back to where we started when the economy collapses next time.
