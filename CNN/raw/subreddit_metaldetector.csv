9907595,0,t3_5hbbcp,Well I just answered my own question! I stumbled across usadetectors.com and they were awesome! I chatted with the owner for a while at pm! and got his opinion. He also gave me his cell number and his personal email so my dad could contact him if he has any questions! Honestly the best customer service I have ever had. I ended up getting the Garrett ace  WAAAY cheaper than anywhere else had the  and also cheaper than I planned on spending on the . I can not recommend them highly enough!,metaldetector,dayzek0,1,t5_2sz1q
