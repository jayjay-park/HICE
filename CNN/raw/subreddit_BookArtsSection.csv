1331224,0,t1_cij864m,I think it would be possible to bind the spine of one of the smaller books to the middle of the shared cover although youd probably want to do that binding first since it would be rather awkward to sew. Youd probably have to alter a coptic stitch a bit to make it work since you wouldnt be able to go around the end of a board but thats fine. I didnt have a chance to make a model yesterday but Im still thinking about it! I would love to see your sketches.,BookArtsSection,cijdocq,1,t5_2x40k
