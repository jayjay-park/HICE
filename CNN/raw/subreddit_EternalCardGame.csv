8829928,0,t1_d78vyhm,Havent seen a list for the nightmare control either but Ive seen them a few times on ladder. I just put some cards together to see how I would try to run it at first and ended up with    x dark return.     x levitate.      x rapid shot.     x suffocate.     x annihilate.      x backlash.     x haunted scream.      x lightning storm.     x lightning strike.     x push onward.     x recurring nightmare.    x wisdom of the elders.     x deathstrike.    x feeding time.      x rain of frogs.      x primal sigil.      x shadow sigil.      x seat of cunning.     I just made this based on my judgements and what Ive seen other people play though. The deck also isnt high tier competative either so careful there.       Also if your just interested in control look into camelless  tempest control. Its probably as good as control gets right now but it has a hard time with party hour so its hard in the meta,EternalCardGame,d798fl7,1,t5_3byur
8832462,0,t3_514awe,Your main goal is just to put them under enough pressure that cards like scouting party arent anything more than chump blockers on  and they cant ever get a foothold. With their removal your aegis units are your biggest boon and with the way most hour lists are built Sword of Icaria is a powerhouse since they dont deal with relic weapons well. If they play a stranger early dont waste a sword on it unless you have another because its likely to get in more damage.

We will grant a credit of some form to everyone whos played based on a percentage of the initial value of your collection accrued at that time most likely  of chests gold and packs earned. Not sure what that percentage will be yet probably wont be huge  but you dont have to worry about converting cards to shiftstones.Dont bother saving stuff. Everything will go.

9098428,0,t3_54waqm,Its hard to say how well you drafted because we cant see what your picks were up against or what you cut but IMO the result is a belowaverage stonescar deck. No torches no oni ronins no obsidian golems very little of the at any cost synergy you see with burn out combust ravenous thornbeast stonescar magus recogulator dark wisp etc. Youve taken some aggressive cards but your curve is a little high for the faction pairing and probably needs  power especially since its  cards which is basically never warranted and certainly isnt in this case. Your  slot is mostly strangers which isnt great since you shouldnt need that much fixing.

9310684,0,t1_d8w4vtp,Im not sure theres a satisfactory answer here because the combo isnt automatic. Id have to manually execute each spell  excavate  x dragons eye loop. Its quite feasible that if all the mechanics worked correctly if you draw above a th card youd have to choose and discard then every iteration of the echovate loop which would take an increasingly long time as youd scroll through more and more cards in the void etc. that the combo could take on the order of  minutes to actually execute.Like maybe the game could be streamlined such that if you knew the card you wanted to excavate you could have a search box for your void start typing exca and itll sort all your excavates from cheapest to most expensive but it doesnt change the fact that its an infinite in which each iteration is composed of several steps.Some people might hate to be on the receiving end of that but I myself would be pretty intrigued.Oh and if you include a static bolt and get it to zero in an echovate loop it kind of works as a wannabe storm card P,EternalCardGame,d8w74fj,1,t5_3byur
9330741,0,t1_d8yq82l,So the stack is TorchProtectStrike after all the spells have been cast. At this point they resolve from left to right. Torch resolves dealing  damage killing sword and dealing  they are at . Now protect resolves since it is next meaning they have Aegis. Now strike attempts to resolve but cant since there is nothing attacking. Casting spells with conditional targets check both on cast and resolution in order to happen same way vanquishing a false prince leaves the OPP with a live frog. Since strike cant resolve it fizzles so it cant crack Aegis. This leaves them with no sword  life and uncracked aegis. Make sense?,EternalCardGame,d8yqmw2,4,t5_3byur

If you dont have a sky plan make sure to include some answers in your deck to take care of air units. In Combrei Predators Instinct is great.

Cabal Countess is often used to knock off a weapon since you can Ambush it in at the end of their turn then whack em without a blocker of course on your turn pseudocharge.Any creature with Charge has the potential to remove a relic weapon.  With all the weapons running around I believe charge units have more value than many give them.  My Battleblur Centaurs have taken down many weapons off unsuspecting opponents.Cards that give Overwhelm like Rampage can kill a blocker and spill damage over to take care of a weapon as well.I really like cards like Execute which kills a unit and does  damage to a player.  These types of cards can be great for pulling a  for  with a unit and weapon kill with  removal card.  Rapid Shot Finest Hour and other buff Fast Spells also combine with your targeted unit to knock off weapons prematurely.,EternalCardGame,dbosvro,2,t5_3byur

Sometimes you get three games in a row where your opponents curve out like its constructed and sometimes you get  games facing only Btier commons and uncommons.That being said in theory it should be getting harder as you do well and your mmr rises because that will queue you against better drafters. However the player population is still pretty small and bronze players will occasionally find themselves up against master players. Anyway keep practicing and trying to get better.

10276468,0,t1_dc8uaoh,Youre comparing apples to oranges which doesnt make for a good argument. In the state of the game right now Titan doesnt feel oppressive. There are lots of ways to deal with it and Im not going to get into this argument with you again. The more I think about it even at  mana Jekk is not as bad as I thought. In fact Id argue that hes really good but doesnt have a home in any existing deck at the moment. Silencing and stunning a unit which gets rid of it for two turns is almost just as good as outright killing it. It even gets through endurance in addition to having quick draw and a statline that allows it to trade into almost everything in the game. Furthermore Id like to point out that you already mentioned several times on this reddit as well as other places about how you want Titan to be nerfed yet now youre asking to make an already strong card even stronger while simultaneously making it the most broken card in the game. By your own philosophy if Titan is broken then Jekk would be absurd at  mana. The mere fact that you predictably mentioned Titan already dismissed any argument you had about Jekk. So Ilyak I ask you which is it? Your ideas dont line up with each other at all and really only show that while you may be good at playing the game you dont really have a inkling of what card balance means. It really just makes a lot of your arguments sound like whining more than anything.    ,EternalCardGame,dc8w5wu,2,t5_3byur

10332417,0,t3_5nov3t,I agree completely. I love draft but Im not particularly interested in constructed. But I am not nearly good enough to go infinite. Which means if I want to play the game mode I enjoy I have to spend  on gems which gets me two runs which lasts for a couple of hours on average.I really love draft mode so if it was up to me Id gladly play this game for a few hours every day right now while I have the time and Im still into it. But that means I have to pay about  every day! Of course the developers deserve money for what they have made but do they really deserve  for every  hours I play? Again remembering that I just do not find constructed enjoyable That means if I want to play this game for example  days a week and play for a few hours each time I have to spend about  every week? Why should I do that when I can play almost any singleplayer game that gives me countless hours for just a onetime purchase?The answer is... because sadly I really love draft modes in card games. Its practically my favourite genre of game I am totally addicted to drafts. But its just not feasible which makes me really sad. This game mode that I love is right in front of me I want to play it so badly but its such a huge money sink that I cant.

Id pay a monthly fee like  a month standard for online games to be able to play draft mode as much as Id like. Even  Id be fine with for a month. I think that would be more than fair.

It is way more consistent and the deck size is a major reason for this.When you draw a card from a  card deck you are drawing a card from a  card deck.

Intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of  avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or  making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders.Unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance.

10466522,1,t1_dcug21h, If your deck can run on  power that should not be something thats punished because oops RNG says you cant play. If we need better answers for a deck that has consistent games on  power thats a different story than one that says this deck is only balanced because it will lose to itself more than any opponent. A fair point but I would much sooner have repetitive highquality games than varied nongames. EG when we played Rakano vs. Felnscar yesterday night or early this morning? that first game was a GOOD FREAKING GAME because both of our decks got to do what it is they were designed to do. How good is a game in which youre able to stick a hammered champ of glory all the way home because your opponent drew  permafrosts a torch and an annihilate? Both players playing their best cards are much better games than only one having that opportunity. This is a good thing. It would disincentivize people from creating allin easilyhated decksdecks that can run on poor power bases. A set should be balanced by the quality of answers available.

Then in TESL subreddit some people were talking about Direwolf Digitals other game which was a lot more like Magic The Gathering.

The Hearthstone design philosophy is to keep everything as dumb and simple as possible because theyre marketing towards a borderline learning disabled audience. source being reluctant to add more than add nine deck slots because they thought it would confuse playersAlso keep in mind that the Hearthstone pro scene is artificially created by Blizzard and because its invitation only its not possible for new players to compete in.Also the client is bad. Even Eternal which hasnt even technically been released yet has a client that is light years ahead of Hearthstone.Hearthstone will stick around because it panders to the lowest common denominator and Blizzard reinvests a portion of its profits into artificially propping up a pro scene.

10746693,0,t1_ddoed4y,Netdecking is a great starting point for new players to learn deckbuilding in a new game IMO.It gives you a feel for how the meta decks work. You can learn the inandouts of each color combination and you can start to tweak it to suit your wantsneeds. Once you get a feel for everything then you start to build semidecent homebrews. Not only does it increase your deckbuilding skills in the longrun but it increases your game knowledge along the way as well.My strategy in any new card game is always netdeck while learning homebrew once Im comfortable. Speeds up the learning process tenfold you know the deck is good so you know that youre losing because of YOUR mistakes not because the deck is bad.

Any damage they can do is beneficial but mostly accidental. If there was efficient enough removal for units I would remove Drones and possibly Scouts for them. If one wants to swing with creatures  they better play actual dual colored decks that specialize in hitting face with creatures.

Theres a huuuuuuge difference between losing to bad card draws based on previous deck building decisions and losing because you just cant play the game anymore.The play chess instead argument is so tired after decades of hearing it. Eternal is an electronic game that doesnt suffer from the same physical limitations that MTG does. As someone else in the thread said they already realize that power is an issue because they force a  power draw on the second mulligan  something MTG couldnt do. They could also easily come up with a better shuffle algorithm that makes it less likely to die from drawing  power in a row without sacrificing the odds and probabilities of a random card game.Good deckbuilding is about mitigating risk and bad luck and having the right answers at the right time.

If you could play a  card deck you would have the same starting hand every game but would lose nd turn every game.The problem is that allowing small decks like that is a huge limiter on design space as the most consistent deck will be narrowed to a small number of cards and then everyone starts to play that deck and it becomes stale.

11517378,1,t1_dg1eut6,I dont play in tournaments so I cant really comment on that.  Its up to DWD as to whether or not they want to balance for draft  constructed ladder  fanmade tournament scene.  If I was them I would not do that.  Trying to balance for  different formats seems extremely difficult.  Heck I wouldve made draft disconnected from constructed so that you can balance  design cards specifically for draft sort of like how Magic the Gathering has cube and Modern Masters. Yes Ive been complaining about burn a long time.  And if Throne Warden was around back then I would complain about that too.  When Throne Warden is bad hes not interesting to play against.  When Throne Warden is good the Armory opponent cant have a board and its horribly uninteresting to play against.  I dont see how Throne Warden is healthy for constructed play.The point is that there are some mechanics that are fun and some mechanics that are not fun.I think its bad game design  balance to push the power level of less interesting mechanics.  For example the power level of Azindels Gift is reasonable.  Gift only sees of play in some decks.  That power level is reasonable though one can make the argument that Gift should be nerfed even more and replaced with The Last Word.  I would like to see burn and armorgain cards get nerfed to Tier   .Its discouraging to me to see DWD nerf interesting mechanics faction control  original Secret Pages push the power level on nonsense Throne Warden and not nerf less interesting mechanics. From my limited perspective as somebody who has never played in tournaments the tournament scene looks healthy to me.

Rall burn out and outlaw seem very weak. Oni striker seems really weak as well in the meta. I would cut down to  rally and one outlaw and add some vaults as well as full out the assembly lines. Rally is getting cut because youre playing a few more one of tech choices that may be great  outlaw works really well one steel fang two katana. Striker needs to be something else honestly.  runs into everything and just becomes  mana kill their weakest minion at best. I could get behind rakano outlaw here as war cry is petty good in this kind of deck and Quickdraw win buffs isnt something to look over. Maresins disciple And displacer seems like they need to be in the  somewhere. Eternal tends to be closer to midrange than mtg and youll get onto board stalls a decent amount.

I wish I was kidding but its true. Since so many players copy the same decks over and over I actually get more new ideas from playing the AI...Of course the same happened in Magic Duels. Mono Time works great in gauntlet IF and I mean IF you have a very good selection and at this point the OP shouldnt have the stuff for it. I recall feeling time was slighted until I got some of its power cards. After that you can develop Combrei and the more expensive in shiftstone cost decks. Mono Shadow also works well in Gauntlet once you have  Umbren Reapers  Impending Doom and  Steward of the Past. These are rares OP not Legends. Shadows Legends are situational except for Vara for the most part. Youll probably wait til last to collect them. Its got just enough draw and LOTs of reliable removal. Also with Impending Doom Lethrai Falchion works great in Gauntlet. It negates Dooms  hp loss and of course gives a lot of lifesteal.

You can interact with Obelisk because they have to play units and the games are interesting. I feel like allin voltron decks are semiinteractive as long as the voltron unit isnt silverwing familiar.  If the unit doesnt have evasion you can chump block to some degree and hopefully race them back unless the equipment is deepforged plate. Shimmerpack is comboesque.

Thats enough to get a playset of KnightChancellor Siraf and Sandstorm Titan.  A lot of people say that Sandstorm Titan is frustrating for new players to face but has anyone considered the possibility that new players can also craft a playset after a couple weeks of play?  Its not like Sandstorm Titan can only be acquired by cash.I reached Diamond this season with the only  legendary cards Ive crafted being Bandit Queen.  Again there are a lot of bad legendary cards you dont need at all so dont worry if you only have .TLDR  The fact that you cant collect all the legendary cards in the game isnt a big deal.  You just should expect as a new player to only be able to play  competitive decks after a few weeks which is fair for a FP game.  If you want to be able to create any deck and own a playset of all the legendary cards expect to pay money.
