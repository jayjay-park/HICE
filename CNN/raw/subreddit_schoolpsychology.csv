4380116,0,t1_csjae6o,Not difficult at all. School psychologists have a unique skill set. However I was hired nearly  years ago and Im not sure of the availability in your state. To get an idea try heading to nasponline.org and search for job postings there are usually a fair amount of jobs listed starting in March. The catch may be you may have to work in a location that is not one of your primary choices. In my state jobs in wellpaying suburbs fill up but there seem to always be postings in rural or lower socioeconomic districts. The key will be to look for a position that will meet some of your criteria. For example if you dont want to travel or if you only want to work in middle school etc. You will get a better understanding of what you will like while on your internship. The internship should provide a broad experience that will allow you to work with students K   or in some cases the age of . Keep the questions coming.,schoolpsychology,csjdhhn,1,t5_2tqny

I hope you find what youre looking for but I have doubts it can actually happen that way.The closest thing we have here is NASP national association of school psychologists for training programs. But even then only about rds of US states recognize it and most dont give any incentive you for doing it above the normal state requirements. Its a very localized field overall.,schoolpsychology,cy4kxs7,1,t5_2tqny
9441096,0,t3_59ym8b,I worked in a few counties in Georgia. We often worked more days during the year but not always and I almost always worked longer days I had tons of meetings in the afternoons. I did a lot on the weekends and over breaks too but I think a lot of teachers do that so thats probably similar. Edit sorry didnt see all of your question. Your schedule as a school psych is going to depend on the county where you work. I had about  weeks off during the summer and several breaks scattered throughout the year for the last county I worked in. As for job prospects in the south my understanding is that theres more job security and higher starting pay in school psych at least in most cases. This is based on my own experience getting a job the day my degree was conferred compared to what my clinical psych professors described regarding their working experience and multiple jobs and scrounging for grant money etc. Good luck!,schoolpsychology,d9cq4sm,2,t5_2tqny
