11513918,0,t1_dg13det,gt I know where theyve moved the local oneWe might try to track down our local one this afternoon. It is about an hours drive from here......Whoa! I thought there was a local one but it appears there may be two! Ive seen one of them as recently as  years ago. Only saw it from the distance it was cold and muddy that day so we didnt trek down. It was rough but didnt appear too far gone as to be unrestorable. Hope we can get a better look today.When I was a kid there was one on the grounds of the State Fair As best I can recall the first year or so that it was there it was a company trying to sell Futuros. I am certain it was used after that by a company selling something else. It has been gone for many years and I wonder if it is one of these two.,bizarrebuildings,dg13rjd,2,t5_3d67k
