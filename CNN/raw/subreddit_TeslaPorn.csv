9380286,0,t3_58w1ag,So I was bored and sitting on the toilet and found this from the EPA website. EPA CO average for a  passenger car For cows it was a bit more work and I didnt bother to look except that if you calculate all the other factors in to raise a cow cows do more damage environmentally combined than a single cow. But Im hoping someone who has more time on their hands than I do figure this out. ,TeslaPorn,d950nqn,2,t5_315f7
