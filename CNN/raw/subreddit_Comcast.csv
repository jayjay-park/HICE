554099,0,t3_20gogn,looks like you ran the speed test from a mobile device so no way to hardwire. My question is did you run the test one time or multiple times? Nothing against you but people will run one speed test and believe its how their speeds are constantly. There are way too many variables that play into wireless speeds ieNetwork trafficDistance from APinterference from other networks radio wavesSo do run speed test multiple times wireless and hardwired. If wireless is constantly low speeds then change the channel of the networking device. If hardwire is low then a bigger issue is occurring. As stated in other post if you have the Arris tgg then rest the device to allow the firmware to upgrade hold the reset button in back of the WG for  seconds and release.

868875,0,t3_2420pf,Upstream power is high and downstream power is low.  SNR is low to marginal across the channels.  The net result of this all isDownstream power fluctuates some and the signal is too weak reaching your modem so the connection drops.The upstream power is how hard the modem is trying to get the signal back up the line.  Yours is having having to shout as loud as possible and that will cause drops when it cant put out enough power to be heard. that  is capped by specificationsThe SNR being low means the data is getting lost in background noise on the line.  This will manifest itself as packet loss or dropped connection if low enough and a slow connection.Fortunately the issues are pretty clear cut you HAVE problems with your signal.  As others suggested try to bypass any useless splitters.  Also verify that all of the connectors are tight especially the outside one where the cable comes in.  If that all checks out then this would certainly be something to be addressed by a tech.,Comcast,ch31nnv,2,t5_2rnei

1403936,0,t1_ciojq78,Hey just saw this post as in my house were currently dealing with a huge number of issues related to Comcasts data caps. They believe we somehow managed to use almost a terabyte of data in  days and are charging us for it. The beta sites that these guys are talking about seem to coincide with Google Fiber hotspots and it seems Comcast is trying to make customers upgrade to a business class account in order to remove data caps. The catch is theyre asking business class customers to sign a  year contract. Meaning that when Google fiber possibly comes to Atlanta next year youd be tied to that contract you signed just to try and get away from the data cap not allowing you to switch over to Google Fiber. Instead of trying to compete with Google theyre trying to make your life hell in order to bully you into a contract to keep you from leaving them.Comcast is skeevy as fuck man.,Comcast,cis9hzs,3,t5_2rnei

3637839,0,t1_cq6iiio,. Blast doubles Performance Internets speed for an additional . You do get access to all HBO channels within the family. I just checked my channel lineup and its exactly  channels with some of the same content repeating on the others. I believe this is the case because some of them are high definition.. HBO content through the settop box is just like on any other channelthey stream it and you wait for whatever you want to watch to start. Its not like On Demand unless you are using a computer or a tablet. Correction The content is available through the On Demand button under Streampix submenu. Their TV channels content isnt updated as frequently as most people would wish and since its a large and varied audience and the movie genres vary drastically as well you might get the impression that theres not much to watch after a week.. With HBO Go we have access to thousands of movies and lots of series. Both the XFinity TV Go and HBO Go make the same content available but when browsing HBOs stuff I prefer to use their own application because their user interface is objectively superior. hbogo.com works on any computer that has flash installed on it. I invariably get p quality using both the android apps and the website. There are restrictions on the devices on which you can use their apps because of licensing issues which means that you might be able to use HBO Go with Comcast authentication on a Roku but not so on a PlayStation or an Amazon Fire TV settop box.I signed up for the Sling TV deal where you get a free device or a discount towards buying a higherend device to stream their content only to find out that Xfinity TV Go nor HBO Go through Comcast work on the Amazon Fire TV Stick. Its not a big deal for me since Ive got an HTPC but those who dont know about this might be disappointed or irate as fuck.FYI HBO very recently released their standalone online streaming service called HBO Now which most likely will work on any device since theres not gonna be an intermediary.tldr Internet Plus  basic TV programming Performance Internet  HBO channels HBO GoXfinity Go access through your computer and certain devices such as tabletssmartphones.

That example uses one person what else ya got? How about my android phone which is linked to dropbox. Every time I snap a picture it auto uploads to dropbox at mbps with about a mb picture theres some lag spikes from maxing out my upload connection with a single user. Upload is just as important because if your modem has packets backing up due to low upload speed then you start dropping packets and lagging in a game. The www.NetDuma.com router I have stops this because you can set a cap to your connection so nobody can utilize your full speeds and cause you to lag. For example while gaming youd set your upload and download speeds to  of their potential speed and you allow  overhead for your modem to breath,Comcast,ct2qxo0,1,t5_2rnei

4676687,0,t1_ctjq7gi,Heres something you can try but it involves maths and while it may eventually hurt Comcast it probably wont fix your problem.  Still this is your only option for ever potentially making a difference.Read this carefullyInternet speeds are typically marketed in megaBITSpersecond.  A megaBYTE is  megaBITS.  Data is usually measured in operating systems by BYTE values and not BIT values.So try doing this.  Determine your advertised download speed in megabytes per second by dividing the megabits per second by .  Well continue to use  mbps as an example  this gives us  megabytes per second..  A gigabyte is  megabytes.  Multiply your datacap in gigabytes by  to get your datacap in megabytes.  If your cap is  gigabytes like it is in many areas that is  megabytes..  If you divide your data cap in megabytes  by your download speed in megabytes per second  the number you get is how many seconds of maxcapacity internet usage you have before you hit your datacap.  In our example this would be  seconds..  Divide that number by  to get the number of minutes before hitting cap   minutes in our example of mbps with a gb cap..  Divide your minutes by  again to get the number of hours of maxbandwidth usage your data cap allows.  In our example  again  megabits per second with a  gigabyte data cap  this results in . hours of internet usage at maximum advertised bandwidth..  Final step.  Your internet is sold as a monthly service and advertised as X speed for Y dollars every  days.  However the data cap means you only get Z hours of actual advertised service before additional fees are levied where Z is the number we get after doing all of this simple division and multiplication.So go to this websiteAnd explain how Comcast doesnt actually offer the service they advertise  a month of internet for  sounds a lot better than  and a half hours of internet then  more for every  hours of use after that.   hours here obviously is what you get if your internet is a measly  mbps.  If your connection is faster than that this number will be even lower.If you are willing to go through this modicum of effort you will put another thorn in Comcasts side and potentially move the government toward curtailing these absurd business practices by ISPs through regulation.,Comcast,ctk1njr,3,t5_2rnei

4991267,0,t1_cungdef,Lets do the math for what youre claimingNetflix states that their Ultra HD setting uses approximately  GB hour A quick calculation shows that  GB  hour comes out to approximately . mb  second of data consumption. According to what you claim you will need to run  Ultra HD Netflix streams concurrently to even approach full usage. You will burn through your plan in  hours like that not even accounting for any other online time you might spend. This is a completely extreme and almost unfathomable thing to do in real life. Instead lets say your wife stays at home and watches  tv episodes on Netflix throughout the day  hours and when you get home you watch  more hours of Netflix together could be a daily movie binging on The Office etc. You have an ok TV so you watch it in HD not Ultra HD. This added to normal web browsing should only come out to be  GB of consumption daily not accounting for weekends when people are bound to watch and browse more. Someone will definitely go over the  GB like that without getting anywhere what you point out as extreme uses of Comcasts service.The users affected by this arent running Googles data centers in their houses theyre just people embracing new methods of media consumption such as buying MLB pass instead of paying for ESPN or ditching cable for streaming services and theyre getting the short end of the stick because Comcast thinks its ok to begin charging for a service that they didnt foresee becoming a problem.,Comcast,cunmthd,5,t5_2rnei

6170295,0,t1_cyqy6g6,gt Do you think any government sanctioned thing is ethical or good?Of course not. But thats a question of criminal law anyway. Your municipality signed a contract. Thats a matter of civil law. Contracts should be honored under their terms thats the core basis of civil trade. That said your existing contract should be ended either by not renewing it or by using whatever exit mechanisms are permitted in its wording.gt Not really. Yet anyway. The only actual competition out of everything you mentioned is fiber as demonstrated by comcasts fear of it....gt I saw and was underwhelmed especially in the context of this conversation.Youreagaindemonstrating your lack of experience outside highly developed areas. You live damn near the upper limit of luxury within the United States and your limited perspective leads you to treat one of the most luxurious cities in the continental United States as directly analogous to other places.Comcast wont even go some places because G penetration is already sufficient there that the local populace likes it is accustomed to it and arent likely to pay the prices Comcast would need to charge to turn even a penny of profit. My parents live in such a place.So yeah competitions doing a bang up job if its resulting in technologies and services delivered to consumers cheaply enough that Comcast cant afford to go there. Thats what a free market accomplishes. Thats also why I brought up Gs impact historically on Comcast speeds. You find it unpersuasive because you dont understand what a significant leap it was and what it continues to do as it spreads to more places.gt Press releases about Google fiber rollouts were actually what moved the needle. Comcast had stagnated in performance if not in price for a decade before that. Google kept saying Hey were going to do this. Hey were going to do this. But we want your municipality to bend over backwards granting us all the rights of way well need. So municipalities were asked for special favors as an incentive for a company to bring a service to town.Sound familiar? It should.Meanwhile every city in the country started demanding degrees of service that even google wouldnt be able to provide if they came to town remember Google was pushing for cities to do all the legwork and happen to have a particularly convenient geography.Meanwhile Comcast is rolling out fiber to the premisis in my market and it doesnt appear to be the bullshit GPON service either. Google never looked in our direction. And theres already two other fiber ISPs.Im sorry your situation sucks but your municipality is the one doing the sucking.gt After your defense of your underperforming ISP in the late s thoughCute. After I explained to you that all of the limitations on client connection speed were out of our hands you still think it was our problem. Which means you still dont understand how the presence of legacy copper and other things such as wet copper impacts service despite my explicitly pointing out several times how different homes had differentquality copper. Your k connection was impressive. It tells me you lived in relatively new construction. Most of our clients ran on copper that was  years old.You accused me of having no empathy. Empathy requires having the ability to see things from other peoples perspective. Your perspective appears to end at your front door. Ive tried several times now to offer how several different points of view play in and you refuse to acknowledge any of it.gt You either understood what was being said there and were trying to do a gotcha type of thing or youre an idiot. The use of hyperbole in no way detracted from the message. Hyperbole is what you use against someone when you want to incense someone. When you want to shut them down. When you want to make it hard for them to think. Its also what you use when you want to score emotional points in support from an audience.It fails to detract from a message if and only if that message is either an emotional one or not actually intended to be comprehended. When trying to persuade someone rationally its best not to make them angry making them angry only shuts down higher levels of thought.gt You speak like someone who feels that companies are entitled to take as much money as they can from consumers even though theyre using technologies other people developed and are granted access to those consumers in a monopolistic way from the government. Such entitlement its really pretty gross. Ive presented rational argument after rational argument. Youve returned with insult after insult. Its pretty clear youve nothing further rational to say.gt Its intellectually dishonest to pretend that anything outside fiber is competing with cable at this point. Even Comcast realizes that. When are you going to catch on?Your urban and suburbancentric perspective is limiting you. Go reread anything Ive said about more rural areas such as where my parents live. You live in a land of luxury and Comcast charges accordingly because nobodys charging less.You want to talk about intellectually dishonest? Its intellectually dishonest to expect fiber to compete with established infrastructure when theres only a few dozen people per square mile. Its intellectually dishonest to assume that all of the technological comparisons that hold true in one of the richest cities in the Western Hemisphere even generally hold true for the majority of the markets in the United States. Its intellectually dishonest to assume that the technological disruptions you experienced five or ten years ago in one of the richest areas of the country have been completed in the exurbs and rural areas in the rest of the country.gt Consumers do when its available after Comcast fails in its efforts to keep actual competition at bay.

They are collected by Comcast but the money does not go to Comcast.  So why are you complaining about theft for a fee that Comcast isnt even getting any money for?  Go complain to your local citycounty elected officials andor state officials who instituted those charges and require that each cable tv subscriber pay them. .  How did you purchase the service?

10741103,0,t3_5tggdb,Hey OP I had the same thing happen to me. Im currently uploading my stuff to the cloud about TB so I decided to use one of the two overages were allowed.You need to call Comcast Security at .When I spoke to them they tried to tell me I was getting these popups because my modem was old I have an SB. After I educated the support person helping me he did fixed it and I am no longer getting popups.I am currently at TB now and no more popups however when I log into my account it says Im going to be charged  dollars for going over TB hopefully it will be fixed when my actual bill comes.,Comcast,ddnv3nh,1,t5_2rnei
10804248,1,t1_ddud6c2,No. In reality comcast was embarrassed into making the cancellation process slightly easier but still annoyingly tedious after a recording was released of one of their desperate customer service reps harassing a customer for quite a while. I actually have my own business and am not that desperate for business that Id make it difficult for customers to leave. Are you a comcast employee?edit Youtube video of the customer trying to cancel.,Comcast,ddudrnh,0,t5_2rnei

10848710,0,t1_ddyy4c2,I can join public servers that are vanilla. Usually I play invade and annex. I was even in a unit and had no issues joining their personal server. Youre correct about not needing to port forward. But mine werent seeding still dont and I tried port forwarding to see if it would work.,Comcast,ddyyuwm,1,t5_2rnei

11045859,0,t1_dek0iy7,Seriously. So wasteful. I walk from my mailbox right over to my recycling bin. I think I get at least two every month but I have two accounts with Comcast.Worst part is that Ive long since opted out of promotional calls and physical mail years ago and they still call me and send me mail. There doesnt seem to be any way to get them to stop.,Comcast,dek11xw,1,t5_2rnei

11081123,0,t3_5y8t8y, The webpage titled Approved equipment for Xfinity INTERNET and Xfinity Voice directs me to My Device info  Unfortunately this link never works.

11128851,0,t1_desw4bm,gt theres simply no real reason to do soWrong. Just as an example Comcast can use the call recordings for their own defense. If the customer lies about what they or the rep said or promised the recording is something they can use in court or to fire a bad employee. ,Comcast,detg1v5,2,t5_2rnei

11359552,0,t1_dfjfxhm,No one imposed anything.  They made an offer with a guaranteed term and you chose to accept the offer key word being chose not forced.  Im no fan of Comcast but the idea that you can choose to enter into a contract and as a result get a cheaper monthly rate and then all of a sudden decide you want to break it without any type of financial penalty is laughable.  Why the hell would they offer you a contractreduced rate if youre just allowed to break it at any time for any reason without any penalty? ,Comcast,dfjl1rr,1,t5_2rnei

11789780,0,t3_67zwme,Ive worked with thousands of current and former customers and never once have actually seen the data cap exceeded so yeah Im sticking with .. Plus even if you do by some fluke do it once or twice we dont charge. Its if you consistently do it every month.Youre wrong about the market dynamic. If CenturyLink could really drop its data caps at no extra cost to them and suddenly be such a more attractive option than Comcast they would have done it years ago.Its actually very relevant. Things arent red herrings just because you say so.,Comcast,dgwetc5,0,t5_2rnei
