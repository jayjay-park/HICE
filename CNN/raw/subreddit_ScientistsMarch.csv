10478734,0,t1_dcvuplr,gt even if I am a straight white male working in science with less valid input on this topic.I wish to take issue with this and state that this is part of the problem.  You shouldnt be having to justify your position based on what you are only what you think.  Your views are defensible or not defensible based on the evidence.Your input is entirely valid.  It might be wrong but I will always challenge it on those grounds alone.The reason I stated that I gave you permission was that it almost requires that in order to get it through the barrier that now exists around stating opinions on the lived experiences of minorities.  What we used to call anecdote we now charge with an immense amount of power and unfortunately the people who are liable to use that power are no nicer than the people who abuse any other kind of power.So please take it from me.  I am giving up my minority position and my minority power in favour of the cause.  Minority scientists will be welcome here but not because of a steering committee but because we care about science.  I do not care about nor do I want to attract the kind of people who infest university diversity committees.  I do not want them to be the centre of this nor do I want them to destroy this as they did the Occupy movement.  This is far too important to me.Otherwise you are going to drown in social inactivists who want to make a point and feel good about themselves rather than defend the intellectual future of our species.,ScientistsMarch,dcvvfma,15,t5_3iqem

10482510,0,t1_dcw2pwl,I understand what youre saying and youre right but I think we should do more than just transitioning from one form of non renewable source to another. While it wont be overnight I think we still need to push back against further developing gas and coal industry sources. So keep existing pipelines and such. Just stop building new ones and instead transition to building new renewable sources of power ,ScientistsMarch,dcwau60,3,t5_3iqem
