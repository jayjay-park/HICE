Youll be able to get the calories you need however you may struggle to eat clean and get the protein you need. That being said once you get past all your training you should have the time and facilities to prepare your own meals. In my personal experience the military gyms are a lot better that any civilian gyms Ive been too. Especially when it comes to free weights.

Youll have to live in the UK and shouldnt leave the country for over  months at a time so thats something to bear in mind depending on the length of your university studies. Youll be best to ring the Army recruitment number which you can get online and ask for the overseas recruitment desk or you can speak to them via the online chat and for the Royal Marines I believe the Royal Navy have a special overseas applications phone number so you may be better off ringing them. ,britishmilitary,cw91m8v,1,t5_2v6tp
5486192,0,t3_3ppy65,Theres two types of tank crewman reconnaissance recce crewman who drive light tanks and Jackal armoured trucks scouting enemy units. This role is sort of half way between infantry soldier and tank crewman. The majority of your job will be driving using the vehicle weapons systems and communicating with other units. At time you can expect to dismount and engage with the enemy on foot using your rifle. Later on you may receive specialist training such as sniper medic forward air controller anti tank operator etc. Elements of recce tank units also made up Brigade Force Recce in Iraq amp Afghanistan providing intelligence for the entire Brigade. From what I heard it was a pretty badass job but they were only formed temporarily for each deployment and with Iraq over and Afghanistan winding down there wont be any opportunities for a while although the concept was very successful so will no doubt be used in future operations. The second role is Main Battle Tank crewman Challenger . Your main role would be to attack and destroy enemy armoured and infantry units. There is little to non dismounted fighting in this role  of your time will be driving loading or shooting the tank. With a few years experience you could command the tank which is mostly directing the tank and communicating with other units occasionally blowing people apart with the commanders machine gun. Day to day is like any other job really. Wake up go into work do morning fitnesspt sessions do a bit of trainingclassroom lessons get marched around with a bit finish and go to the pub. Courses and training exercises are pretty much like school trips. Accommodation food etc is pretty much like been a student. As a junior officer youd be expected to command several tanks at once. As you move up the ranks you could command more however like all officer roles at some point your expected to go work behind a desk. Also officers do a lot of talking answering questions observing things as opposed to shooting driving etc.Tank crewman is a fairly varied role. Lots of different skills to learn such as infantry skills for recce various driving licenses mechanic communications sniper forward air controller medic etc.,britishmilitary,cwcwu5d,2,t5_2v6tp

Its worth searching Student Room for all its faults its more active than Reddit on these sorts of things. From a quick glance the requirements for a RAF pilot arent onerous  GCSEs including maths  Alevels  UCAS points. That said my hunch is that considering the number of aircraft is in the hundreds and the number of personnel in the tens of thousands its fair to say most dont go on to be pilots. Its most likely very competitive as the cost of training a single pilot can run in the millions. My advice go talk to a RAF careers adviser. Ask them straight what it takes to become a pilot and its likelihood but if a career in the RAF is your goal then theres obviously many other roles you might like. UAVs are likely to become considerably more prominent in air offences and Id expect require less training than manned vehicles. Might be an option. ,britishmilitary,d6i2lok,2,t5_2v6tp
