2201432,0,t3_2k7nfe,Hey still working on it!  As Belly said its a lot of engine stuff at the moment so theres not really anything to show.  If I released it in smaller versions it would most likely break save games each time so I tried to get the biggest changes all done in one go Also to move towards Steam release asap!  It shouldnt be too much longer and after that I can release smaller patches again for items and recipes etc.  Heres a small sprite preview of whats being added! link,forsakenisle,cljnmmq,7,t5_32rws
