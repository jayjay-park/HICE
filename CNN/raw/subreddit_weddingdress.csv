5266946,0,t3_3n54xk,Didnt order from that site but a few of my friends ordered from similar ebay sellers. One word of advice. Try on dresses before you order anything. You may be surprised what looks best on your body and how certain styles you love may not look as good as you imagine. You dont have to buy in person but its worth it to at least get things on your shape. ,weddingdress,cvkwt5u,3,t5_2syju

Edit It looks like Kleinfelds carries it or a similar version. Their site has it in white but you could call them about the blush and ask if they or anyone else carries it.,weddingdress,d73xwju,5,t5_2syju

9796672,0,t1_dakk63x,Funny you say that....  I ordered from them and the next day it said the dress was shipped. It then sat for  days. I am not getting married until next year so I wasnt too worried but the part that really irked me is that they were nonresponsive to me. I asked when it would actually ship and heard NOTHING! I started a PayPal dispute and lo and behold the order was here in the next two days. I would say be careful with them and leave PLENTY of lead time but I actually really like the dress and it appears to be the brand they claimed. So I dont know if I would order from them again but this all turned out ok. And you cant beat  for a ballgown,weddingdress,dakngj0,2,t5_2syju
10051232,0,t3_5jir26,So Ive ordered dresses from China before not wedding but formal and they came in horribly wrong. Im very skeptical even of pictures but you say you can see actual customers pictures? That might help but any other suggestions so help me be less skeptical? ,weddingdress,dbhp8rp,1,t5_2syju
