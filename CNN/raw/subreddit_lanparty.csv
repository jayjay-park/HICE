4208077,0,t3_392t86,I made a .net application using a spotify c wrapper combined with XAMPP local server software where I hade a plain webpage with a textfield. The user could copy the song url and paste it into the field and submit. This could be done from any device with a webbrowser.The host runs my application and the app constanly checks for any differences in the text file where all songs are submitted. If it detects any change it adds the url to a custom queue system I couldnt find any support for just queueing into spotify. I used this app in my classrom third year in highschool and it worked like a charm. Not the best solution but definately a working one.If youre interested I can explain some more and hit you up with the files.,lanparty,crzwqdz,6,t5_2rggr

Granted its not a big connection but smaller ones bonded together.  I do this for  events per year of  people.   Sometimes you can even pull your own coax drop to get it where you need then you will need an amplified signal splitter to get signal to all the modems. Otherwise you will have to see if you can get a local ISP to help out. Not everyone is as lucky as Big Spence is and has Fiber on hand.  P,lanparty,d7t62m4,1,t5_2rggr

10581213,0,t3_5rhfnp,Raid  and SSDs are not a good combo... Personal experience.Ive found steam hits a ceiling around the megabit mark. A single client. Which makes sense it has a limit albeit an absurd one assuming an internet connection.Try a second box in parallel and see if the throughout from your cache exceeds that  figure. When I was testing mine I found it topped out between  and  megabits. MBs is about  megabits.... Ish.Steam content is chunked not the whole package so itll start stop and repeat and individual client throughput can be misleading. Try multiple clients and look server side at your speeds across the wire. ,lanparty,dd7dcff,1,t5_2rggr

11377649,0,t1_dflmkj1,OK. Lets do this.You only need an  port switch for up to lets say  people. Attach a router on one port to connect everyone to the internet and provide stuff like DHCP to let it assign an IP to everyone. Not the most exciting setup but its rock solid and everyone who is convenient with configuring a home router can administrate the network.Above that it gets a bit more complicated. When you connect switches then it is best practice to do it like a star. If there are even more it is design like a tree. When you now build in a loop e. g. two cables from one switch to another to increase the bandwidth then the whole network crashes. Maybe even produce blue screens on the machines as well.What you need to do is to assign a backbone switch. This backbones needs to be a bit manageable doesnt need to be full layer  but it doesnt hurt to be as well. What you need is trunking andor STP support. What you do now is to assign  or  Ports per switch and assign it to one trunkbondwhatever your manufacturer calls it. On the other ports youll attach your router and gameservice servers. The other Switches are being attached with  cables to the backbone and you are done. You can do this with as many switchuplink ports you like or your backbone switch gives you. If you just want to distribute internet and make LAN play possible then you only need one cable and no STPtrunk config. But be advised that then all participants on one switch are only connected to all other switches by that port. The more ports you assign the more bandwidth the users have with each other. Edit My suggestion for  players  Backbone    Port Web Manageable Gigabit Switch  Server Switch    Port Switch  Group Switches  Port Switches   Build a trunk for    ports   Attach a router to one port of the backbone  Attach another Gigabit  Switch for your and the guests servers as needed  Connect each of the group switch by   SFTP Cable with the backbone to their assigned portsAnd thats it  you have now space for  players       plus their servers. The more visitors youll get the more switches you need the bigger the backbone needs to be the more ports you need to assign for your server switch. Welcome to the world of scaling your network Edit  My suggestion for  playersSame as above with just  group switches. That way you can easily assign the third switch without building the whole network from scratch because need to plug everything from the big  port switch over to the backbone concept. ,lanparty,dflmyoj,8,t5_2rggr
