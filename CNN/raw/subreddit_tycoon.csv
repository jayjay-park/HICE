2028467,0,t1_ckxmzpq,I just started using Twitter this year and I find it pretty great for keeping up with other indie games.I think in the eyes of a consumer they could all be considered IT company management games i.e. theyre not that far apart thematically. I agree competition is great it drives us to make better games which benefits everybody. Ive gotten a lot of inspiration from reading your blog posts just now I hope you can get something out of mine too.That is my exact goal with Software Inc. as well. Currently my game can simulate different types of companies game companies tools developers operating system companies etc. andor run a prescripted series of events and Ive implemented a simple stockmarket so that the companies will buy each other and their franchises or just invest. Each month all of the products in the game will be evaluated for profits and company reputation gain based on its merits and competing products. The company AI is pretty simplistic though their strategy is based on income and an averageproductquality variable.,tycoon,ckxnufg,1,t5_2t8iw

3747867,0,t3_32licx,I bought it on release and while I enjoyed it it didnt hold my interest for long. However I started playing it again a few weeks ago and the updates and improvements have improved the game significantly. Different teams made TS and Sim City but I definitely get the impression that there was a corporate goal at Maxis of reduce outward scope but increase inward scope. So typical improvements you would expect like bigger cities or interactive neighbourhoods are absent but theyve spent a huge amount of time making the actual sims emotions more interesting and accessible with unique animations for conversation interactions etc. I quite like the direction both TS and Sim City have taken but interactive neighbourhoods are sorely missed.  ,tycoon,cqjhcyr,1,t5_2t8iw

Whats the game stance on the ecological model? Does it use the normal paradigm of considering the environment as an input and outflow flow loosely independent from it or does it include it in the simulation considering resource flows but also resource funds externalities pollution etc? ,tycoon,ctoqvjx,2,t5_2t8iw
4893781,0,t3_3hv2ul,I keep seeing this game posted here but its not really a tycoon game in my opinion i played a build of it about a year ago it might have changed a lot. It has some elements of tycoon games but it felt more like a puzzle game,tycoon,cubef6t,3,t5_2t8iw
4961126,0,t3_3hga8g,Heres my take.INFRASTRUCTUREAirports are a very complex business. Early on in the game you should probably start out with an airport with prebuilt run and taxiways to ease the user into the game. Later on this becomes a task of yours as well. Terminal design is hugely important. Depending on where in the world you are you may have several different zones. Personally I live in the Schengen area which means that a lot of flights are very easily handledI work at an airport and do this for a living. However some flights leave the Schengen Area and therefore our local authorities require a passport control. This is done by the police in some places and elsewhere by third parties. The design of the terminal must of course be efficient and easy to navigate while a the same time saving as much space as possible. Seperate checkin areas for priority customers High status frequent flyers firstbusiness class customers etc should be in placemore on this later.BUSINESSHey we gotta earn some money right? Generally airports are very very different from each other in how they run their business. I work at a fairly small airport where we actually do most of the work ourselves. The airport employs all checkin staff all the security staff all the gate staff all the ramp staff and we run all the shops. However if you dont want that hazzle subsidize it  although you wont make as much money since the third party will have to take their share as well. Also this opens op a possibility for different philosophies. Do you want to save money on staff and potentially have unhappy customers due to long waiting times or do you want to provide a better service? Where I work the philosophy is to have plenty of staff in the checkin area because that means the passengers quickly go into the shops where they spend money. The idea being that we actually earn money by having more staff at hand.AIRLINESThis part is critical. Like.. This is what makes or breaks the game. Airlines are also very very different. Some airlines rarely get in touch with us as long as we dont damage their aircraft or severely delay them. Some are in touch each and every day to check up on the smallest of issues. Their demands are very different as well. Say you have a small airline coming to open a route from your airport. They dont demand a whole lot  checkin counter to be opened  hours before departure and a single gate agent. Two staff at the ramp should be plenty. But if you want to land one of the big airlines think LufthansaEmiratesQatarKLMDeltaAir FranceBritish Airways they will require a fair bit more. Dedicated checkin counters for priority customers. Lounges for said customers. Dedicated arrival service staff. Dedicated boarding. Very low delay tolerance. The upside? A bit more money from the airline for a well handled flight. Now there will be some at the other end of the spectrum as well. In the real world we know them as ULLCs Ultra Low Cost Carriers. They are the companies like Ryanair that will pay very little for the handling however they typically go in big and bring a lot of customers. So your airport will get a massive volume boost but you wont really get much on the bottom line  if anything at all. These are also extremely focused on on time performance typically with reduced handling fees if you delay a flight.So how do airlines and airports get in contact? Well airlines are the king here. Airports are the beggars. In the real world an airport often approaches the airlineTheres an inverted pun here with a business case stating how many passengers can be expected for a given route etc. The airline will then state a series of demands that must be met and if all is good and well a contract is signed.God I wish someone would actually make a game like this.,tycoon,cujw0jq,2,t5_2t8iw

6651689,0,t1_d0787t8,I started by looking up tactics that worked for other people. They often have very detailed explanations aout why they work. For example I liked to use wingers but they never performed. So i looked up tactics and I learned that by giving the strikers a more defensive role they would hold up de ball allowing the wingers to rush up the flanks. The tactic even had a real life example. ,tycoon,d07cbs8,3,t5_2t8iw
6671391,0,t3_46qvwg,My problem is I do like the sport... but I find the actual match day interactions completely lacking and leaving me wanting more.  I find that in this game and many other sport managers I just set it and forget it... I almost never make any decisions during the matches as they dont feel like they have a large impact.  So I just simulate through so many matchesweeks doing absolutely nothing... than make a tweak here and there and rinse and repeat.  I like the sports managers where I get a good level of interaction during the actual matches.  And for that heres my top ... Motorsport Manager iOSAndroid.  Yeah... thats right... my favorite and the best F racing manager ever created is on smart phones.  Lots of great interaction and decisions to be made during the realtime qualifyingraces to keep it interesting from start to finish.  This one man team did so good they got recognized by SEGA Football Manager publishers and is now working with them on a bigger project.  Really hope its a more indepth PC manager it would be really amazing! Football Tactics  Love child of Football Manager and Civilization franchise  Love this little game.  While the off field management isnt as deep as FM theres still lots to love.  But the gameday simulation plays out like a little tactical board game and is lots of fun. Cricket Captain  For more traditional style sports managers I find that cricket lends itself the best.  It feels natural to review your strategy every over no matter if batting or bowling pitching.  Because of this theres a lot more meaningful decisions made during the match.  If you know even a little about cricket and enjoy sports managers dont miss out on this series.  Out Of The Park baseball would be similar in terms of level of interaction as youd make a decision with the arrival of each batter... I just happen to prefer the strategy and sport of cricket over baseball.,tycoon,d09do1y,2,t5_2t8iw

7186904,0,t1_d1um6so,One tycoon that I think handles this very well is Casino Inc. a casino manager. At first youre struggling to make a few bucks and get enough income. About middle of the game you start having bastards try to cheat your poker tables and start fights at the bar to keep people away. Then you have to figure out whether you beat the shit out of them to get money back or let them go. Of course sometimes they may not have been stealing at all and you can lose reputation and loss of staff.Then you start dealing with fighting the other casinos. They could send a hitman in your casino to force evacuation and loss of business or set a floor on fire. It gets very brutal.,tycoon,d1v37zq,1,t5_2t8iw

10788414,0,t3_5tv1zx,Personality.One of my favorite band management games is Rock Manager also seems to go by Band Manager. Although theres actual music for the songs and the details around that are pretty fucking cool what sold it to me is the personality found with each of the musicians in game.Granted most of it is limited to the actual missions themselves and a lot of it is sold through the voice acting its still neat to see which members get along which dont which pick up addictions and the fallout of these things.Most of other games seem to be pretty bland in this department even the good ones treating the actual musicians as faceless set pieces for the band as a whole. A couple games include some of these details  like addictions and relationships  but its all presented through charts and graphs for relationships or is just mentioned once on a screen for addictions which sucks all the personality out of these defining traits and characteristics. In those games when these things provide conflict or interest it comes across as meaningless. And since these games tend to treat musicians as faceless fodder for your band these conflicts are treated more as a nuisance and the solution to these problems is to replace them.Though its an option in Rock Manager you can find ways to appease the band members and fix these problems instead of outright replacing or firing a member. Is your guitarist addicted? Send him to rehab. Two members hate each other? Lie and say good things about them to repair relations.Again the voice acting for each musician probably helps sell this more than it should as does the actual premade songs as does the small pool of musicians its easier to get familiar and attached to a group of  characters than an infinitely generated horde of random people but it really helped set it apart from other band management games in my eyes.,tycoon,ddsqxm3,4,t5_2t8iw
