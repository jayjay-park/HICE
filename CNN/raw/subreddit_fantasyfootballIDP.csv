5853467,0,t3_3vdzh3,It would be nice if Jamie Collins could come back and get on track.To answer your question the usual suspects.The best LBs arent particularly matchup dependent.,fantasyfootballIDP,cxmx1nh,2,t5_2vavz
6793025,0,t3_47fwrh,And now hes the best DE on the team with the release of Johnson. ,fantasyfootballIDP,d0ma1ek,1,t5_2vavz
8219887,0,t3_4rvddm,this looks amazing great work! hope my league is open to something like this. let us know how it goes! also would love to see some sample rosters.,fantasyfootballIDP,d551ird,2,t5_2vavz
8288566,0,t1_d59xdyf,I know what you mean  I accidentally just fell in love with Myles Garrett.,fantasyfootballIDP,d5dmoh5,1,t5_2vavz
8524579,0,t1_d671n62,I would look towards interceptions.  pick  could win your week. And if they are good snagging the ball then they will be good at deflecting passes and tackles.  The return DBs are hit and miss. Look at your league scoring to tell. Sometimes return kick yards score less than rushing yards ect..  If I were you I would go for a strong safety that gets sacks,fantasyfootballIDP,d674uyr,2,t5_2vavz
8847973,0,t3_51cryv,Ok looks like you have some work to do. I think Clowney has a lot of potential so depending on where you drafted him that is decent choice. Looking at your scoring you need to look for pass rushers cause they can rack up the points for you.,fantasyfootballIDP,d7befl9,1,t5_2vavz
8857028,0,t3_51gon9,Insane scoring settings.,fantasyfootballIDP,d7chn0d,2,t5_2vavz
8871334,0,t1_d7e7fvl,You got the top rated safety and linebacker so Id say you did pretty well.,fantasyfootballIDP,d7e7jns,1,t5_2vavz
8873113,0,t3_51rob2,I would go Cam this week being that they are playing the Raiders. ,fantasyfootballIDP,d7ef8rp,2,t5_2vavz
8882941,0,t3_51wxj2,I like the Honey Badger but Collins does have a chance to be a tackling machine with NYGs questionable LBs. Tough choice dont think you could go wrong.,fantasyfootballIDP,d7flqsy,1,t5_2vavz
8941321,0,t3_52i91z,I dropped him. DQwell will always be tight in my book but hes not an every down back this year. Wasnt aware of that when I drafted him. I picked up Kwon and if he doesnt work out Ill grab Trevathan.,fantasyfootballIDP,d7mm5em,1,t5_2vavz
9025685,0,t1_d7wke3a,Norman is shadowing OBJ this week FYI so he no longer is stuck on a side of the field,fantasyfootballIDP,d7wqutz,1,t5_2vavz
9118587,0,t1_d87tg0r,Youre right that Griffen is the top dog and thats a part why Hunter has been so successful. Teams are doubling Griffen and saying were gonna make the rook beat us. So far he has been doing just that. He seems he is a nice fit for this defense and I would think hell continue to flourish. With that said the more success he has the more teams will pay attention to him. I have him in my league and starting him over Kahlil mack right now.,fantasyfootballIDP,d87wmy0,1,t5_2vavz
9128899,0,t3_54xvy0,Im answering my own question but idpguru.com has EXACTLY the kind of stuff Im looking for... the links down the right side are as much as I could ask for. Im donating!  Great resource. ,fantasyfootballIDP,d895jkj,1,t5_2vavz
9218798,0,t1_d8kjbgo,Hes looked decent but for the LB position it hasnt been good. With the DE designation I think he jumps up a tier or two. Not sure Id cut Leonard Williams for him Williams has looked pretty good,fantasyfootballIDP,d8kjtep,3,t5_2vavz
9228281,0,t3_55x8ar,James numbers were shit. Anyone see the game?  Were his snaps limited?,fantasyfootballIDP,d8lr37q,1,t5_2vavz
9248110,0,t3_56zwjh,For real what a dilemma. I was just looking at my draft recap and it projected KM to be the highest scoring DL in the league this season. Sad to say its been far from that. This Oakland D looks awful and like you said opponents are taking advantage of that by concentrating all of their effort on containing Mack. HOWEVER I play in a keeper league and i picked Mack up off waivers last season week i think?? when some mope dropped him and I basked in his fantasy glory on my way to a fantasy championship. My team was stacked but Mack was a monster down the stretch last year. I cant drop him but i am opening a roster spot to hold onto him until things start to pick up. Id recommend you to do the same. ,fantasyfootballIDP,d8o9kys,2,t5_2vavz
9503264,0,t3_5az0p6,I would prefer Beasley I think there is much more upside.,fantasyfootballIDP,d9kha9m,2,t5_2vavz
9525912,0,t3_5b1nzh,Im in a league that rewards big plays quite heavily and Ive been pretty satisfied with his performance aside from week . Hes only averaging . solo tackles a game which I of course would love to see higher but on the season hes got  tackles for a loss a sack  passes defended and  force fumbles. If youre in a league like mine where I get to play two LBs and Im getting  points nonstandard setting I know for those big plays then Im happy enough rolling him out there nearly every week.Edit I guess I should add that Im in a pretty big league with a fairly decent size bench so  LBs are owned. If your league has more top level guys available I understand you parting ways with David.,fantasyfootballIDP,d9n9qde,1,t5_2vavz
9662724,0,t3_5dfm39,It is still in appeal and he should be a go tonight. Btw Rotoworld is a pretty good source for these kind of things. ,fantasyfootballIDP,da44ssx,2,t5_2vavz
