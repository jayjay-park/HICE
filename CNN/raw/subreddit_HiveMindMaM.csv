6423463,0,t1_czjg06o,Exactly. Anyone at the Avery yard knew she came out regularly. Also people she knew might have known especially if they had access to her voicemail as Mike Halbach and Ryan Hillegas did. Im not accusing anyone of course. Right now Im leaning toward the Zipperer theory personally and that one involves nobody actually setting out to murder her. Which is a possibility I also feel shouldve been investigated. People get shot by hunters and by people who think they are trespassing in rural areas like this.,HiveMindMaM,czjq103,1,t5_3c8bp

6467796,0,t1_czo9zoc,gt So why in case of burning body right by his trailer he doesnt care about alibi disorganized...even more invites others to join him??? IMO here is the conflict. I think that he wants to have an alibi and that having the bonfire is his alibi.  Its an even better alibi if other people come over to the bonfire.  He can burn the body after everybody leaves.  gtRAV was NOT hidden! I think it was hidden in the best possible place in the yard.  Avery didnt see it but neither did his brothers or any of the customers or the planehelicopter that flew over.Pam was looking for it and didnt see it until she was next to it.  You are saying it was not hidden?  The only way to see it is to be up on the ridge and it looks like theres hardly any traffic up there.  So it seems like it is very well hidden.  Did you see my other post in this thread with the pictures?gtIt was placed and decorated to be found by logical thinking people.I disagree.  I never understood this argument.  Are you saying that because it is poorlyhidden that this is evidence that the car was planted?Ill ask again.  If someone was planting the vehicle why would they hide it at all?  To hide it from the Averys?  Then why do it so poorly?  Because they are not logical?  If the car was planted it doesnt even matter if the Averys find it because they dont have a key.  What are they going to do with it besides incriminate themselves?  They are going to call the cops.gtIt was placed facing wrong directionWrong direction from what?  The crusher?  It looks like its facing in the same direction as the red SUV and the white car and opposite of the green truck.gtit was double parallel parkedSee pictures in other post.  It wasnt on the road it was very close to the red car and the red car was well outside the line of cars.gtit was placed like you said on the most logical pathThe most logical path for someone searching the entire salvage yard for one specific vehicle.  I dont think he expected that to ever happen.gtQuestion should be Would Killer with car junk mentality do such thing??I think Avery grew up in the salvage yard.  He knows every corner of the salvage yard and where would be the best place to hide a vehicle.  I am having a hard time trying to find a better place to hide it on the property can you?  So yes a killer with junkyard mentality would do such a thing.  Exactly this thing.EDIT  Avery didnt see it arguing two threads at once,HiveMindMaM,czobdsf,3,t5_3c8bp
6468345,0,t1_czocwki,Did you read my other post with the pictures?  I am saying that nobody can see the RAV from the main yard.  They can only see it when they go up on the ridge.  Do you agree?,HiveMindMaM,czodfg0,1,t5_3c8bp
6498360,0,t3_44m3xl,I would also add in to this timeline that before StrangButing were hired they were attempting other ways to build and solidify the case and further the character assassination of SA as well.   Not exactly sure in timing but they were investigating SA for the alleged molestationrape of the  or  old family membercousins daughter.  From what I have seen is that case dissolved due to lack of evidence and cooperation from the accuser and I believe her mother.Depending on timing it could show there desire to get something to stick against SA before lawsuit and depositions started heating up. ,HiveMindMaM,czrh96l,3,t5_3c8bp
6500856,0,t1_czrq3dj,No youve been clear and I meant to erase that part about the we agree to a point because it is clear from everything else youve written in the past has been in defense of victims rights and I was only referring to your one sentence in the above post....told you Im bad at reddit and cant format for shit so my posts come across wrong sometimes when Im on my phone.     edit plus Im watching the Super Bowl and distracted...

6926355,0,t1_d11bjog,I just realized who you are.  Sigh...  Ill respond but this is the last one in this thread.I think I understand your point.  Youre saying that Police Officer Kyle Baars planted evidence that played no significance in the case.  This is especially true when you consider that Brantley still was sentenced  years for homicide. Tibbs also pleaded to a felony murder charge.But you are incorrectly using a single officer trying to solidify a conviction by planting evidence in a backpack as an example of how theres really no significance to why the blood was planted in  different places in the RAV.  Because what Im saying is that the places the blood evidence was found on the RAV makes sense if you were putting Teresa Halbachs body in the trunk.  In fact it makes perfect sense.You have a nice evening.,HiveMindMaM,d11fe74,1,t5_3c8bp
