8068821,0,t3_4pohwv,This is definitely something from the passiflora passion fruit family. Due to the orange fruit I guess that its Passiflora caerulea as thats a very popular variety. If the flowers are mostly blue or if the fruits inside is red like a mini gac fruit  then its definitely caerulea. All passion fruit grow on vines and I actually grow mine on a fence just like in the picture! ,fruit,d4n0fkj,1,t5_2rln2
