8141460,0,t3_4qo6r9,For me the hook was the low price. A p action cam for a price less than a third of the GoPro at the time was simply amazing. And the samples I was seeing were good. Not perfect perhaps but really good. After doing a bit of reading about it and watching various reviews I decided to give it a shot. Ive not been disappointed so far. Keep in mind that Im talking about the first Yi camera though and bought it just after it came out. Having said that Ive been impressed with some of the equipment that Ive purchased from Xiaomi. They seem to be a doing a good job of driving the price of tech toys down.,xiaoyi,d4v87nf,2,t5_37qb7
