1480571,0,t1_cj1uusy,Possible. But the footage must still be checked for any traces of whateverSAMwasused. And until evidences are found and Im sure they will find something we cant be sure if it was recorded. It will take some time to find it. Because we cant be sure the word likely is absolutely correct.    Edit I also wrote suspected system which means that I cant know the exact system and referred to what the media knows.    Edit II I also wonder where you got your knowledge it was a BUK M. Source? Both of them are around there in ukrainian and russian military. Id rather guess you can only know which it was exactly if you were close to it. In other words If you are involved in this conflict somehow.,MH17,cj1v5kn,0,t5_32luw

1522046,0,t1_cj6zxcy,Just to be fair....Even if there was a mistaken identification which Iran has not accepted it argues that this constituted gross negligence and recklessness amounting to an international crime not an accident.In particular Iran expressed skepticism about claims of misidentification noting that the Vincennes had advanced Aegis radar that correctly tracked the flight and its Mode III beacon two other U.S. warships in the area Sides and Montgomery identified the aircraft as civilian and the flight was well within a recognized international air corridor. It also noted that the crew of the Vincennes was trained to handle simultaneous attacks by hundreds of enemy aircraft.Even if the aircraft had been an Iranian F Iran argued the U.S. would have had no right to shoot it down. The aircraft was flying within Iranian airspace and did not follow a path that could be considered an attack profile nor did it illuminate the Vincennes with radar.During the incident the Vincennes had also covertly entered Iranian territorial waters without first declaring war while aiding Iraqs  war against Iran. Regardless of any mistakes made by the crew the U.S. was fully responsible for the actions of its warship under international law.Iran pointed out that in the past the United States has steadfastly condemned the shooting down of aircraft whether civil or military by the armed forces of another State and cited El Al Flight  Libyan Arab Airlines Flight  and Korean Air Lines Flight  among other incidents. Iran also noted that when Iraq attacked the USS Stark United States found Iraq fully responsible on the grounds that the Iraqi pilot knew or should have known that he was attacking a U.S. warship.,MH17,cj72dmj,2,t5_32luw
1527261,0,t1_cj7pbmm,It also doesnt have an autonomous backup mode nor does it have a datalink option to connect it to other MANPAD acquisition systems or command vehicles. But it does have a tiny battery operated IFF interrogator not unlike the ones in military combat aircraft.  Do you think that the IFF interrogator is just sitting on the outside of the Fire Dome or Snow Drift able to be seen such that it can be judged whether it has one or not?  Come on dude...Bill is making an assumption because he assumes that the Fire Dome is used most often as part of the full network of vehicles andor hes confusing the autonomous backup mode which presumably isnt smart enough to automatically trigger IFF interrogation when creating a target list.Its my guess that this autonomous step is skipped for the sake of speed because you assume that this mode is used when another vehicle is destroyed especially the Snow Drift and you want to autonomously be ready to kill that target just using the Fire Dome before the target leaves the vicinity.  Its probably the closest target in the list and the system gives the operator limited selection capability in this mode as it would be expected to be something of an emergency.The assumption here is that there is no need for IFF in a close air environment with a hostile that just took out another part of the SA system within km of the networked chain.  Or that the target may actually look friendly and you dont want to use IFF to discriminate in this situation.,MH17,cj7pwp6,1,t5_32luw
1531935,0,t1_cj892rj,Thank you for responding. Ukraine isnt and enver was in possesion of the cockpit voice recordings. Russia has been talking about Ukraine releasing Aircraft controll data which they havent done to the public. I think you got those two confused.I suspect that they will have to release it to the investegators of the crash site which the Netherlands currently has controll of. After the bodies have been found been send back etc etc the how and why is definitly next and I suspect they will release it gladly. Russia believes an SU  a ground attack airplane with a normal operating ceiling of km and a max of  without any weapons on which also has normally no airtoair missles  shot the plane. I find that story so absolutely silly that it borders on offensive. I need solid proof for it not what Russia has released so far which are some satelite images from something which I cant interpret or understand well enough and some random  computer made images that say it was at km a  su . Which doesnt mean anything.  ,MH17,cj8az7t,2,t5_32luw

1547676,0,t1_cja8nj3,You mean anyone who doesnt agree with you cant post? Would these be the separatist posts that when posted on you tube by the Ukrainians were proven to have been created before the plane was shot down? All I asked you to do is wait until the evidence is produced independently why cant you do that.

2722774,0,t1_cncrqqh,So it goes like this there are hundreds if not thousands of civilians on the ground. Theres that roaring sound of a missile screeching all the way from the launch location to the target. And not a single person that lifted their head up to see the source of the sound noticed the huge plumous trail all the way across the sky and shouted what the fck is that?!?!. Really?So far I havent seen any eyewitnesses claiming they saw the trail whereas there are eyewitnesses claiming on camera that they saw the warplane. Im not buying that either but the disparity is deeply disturbing me.gt That was a minute after the explosions I think.You saw the video right?You saw two missiles hit the target right? Which was flowing at LESS than  km by the way.Have you heard two explosions?Im not buying that the guy heard the explosion from  km above. You will barely hear the kg explosion from  km away  let alone above  where air is much much thinner and conducts sound much much worse.If we are to believe that he indeed heard the explosion that clearly indicates that it happened much much lower than MH flight altitude.,MH17,cndkg3k,0,t5_32luw
2772154,0,t3_2rtg3d,Well the headlines accurate at least.Fairly sure the DSB arent allowing submission of dreams as evidence in their investigation especially precognitive ones that arent known about until after the fact.Also doesnt help that the original post on the th was updated and yet still includes a number of false claims like the fact the previous flight paths for MH were not over the war zoneMaybe theyd have better luck if they turned that precognition to something more useful like lottery numbers?,MH17,cnj6mpp,1,t5_32luw
4242732,0,t1_cs3pd6p,gt You can barely even make out the edge of the Buk at the topleft. Does this still look like a reflection problemAs stated in my previous reply theres numerous examples of photos taken in vehicles where the reflection from the windscreen can be more or less opague across the image obscuring detail.Basic photography here. Given you like drawing on pictures heres a more in depth look at the Paris Match ImageThe loss of detail is present throughout the image and is not restricted to just the BUK but also the road and the flat bed. Therefore your conclusion the BUK must be a later addition can be demonstrated to be faulty.gtHow do you know this is wrong?Because planes travel in roughly straight lines the Russian flight plan would have MH travelling in a Zigzag far from its authorized route which we know from the transcript of Russias own ATC wasnt the case and also from the FDR. Two independent corroborated sources saying the Russian DoDs flight path is hilariously wrong.gtit woudnt answer who fired the rockets or who had the capability to do so.The flight path is critical for showing what locations were in range and when. From location where the plane was downed and the coordinates of the ELB we can draw a radius of the effective BUK range to show all possible launch locations. While we cant know who pulled the trigger it is clear it had to be fired from within Separatist territory far behind the lines.gtWhat a coincidence then that FlightawareIf by coincidence you mean relied on extrapolated data revising the flight path when more accurate data was available then yes.gtYou do realize that they showed the Buk launcher also by ZaroshchenskeTwo of the BUKs cast shadows that fall to the West One casts a shadow to the North. Thats more than enough to question the legitimacy of the image.Add in the fact that both Correct!ve and Novaya Gazeta sent journalists to interview locals who saw nothing and we can question this further.We also have no idea where these BUKs arrived from or when or when they left and along what route. In short we have no credible reason to believe that the BUKs shown are Ukrainian theres no visible markings and theyre km behind enemy lines. Given that the UA made no significant gains south of Zaroshchenske for the next  weeks we can likely deduce the situation wasnt fluid enough for  BUKs to slip by unnoticed by anyone.gtThe problem is they merely say that state that was the address of the dealer but went further to make the specific claim that the address was on the billboardThis banner has an address of the car shop situated at the Dnepropetrovskaya .gtYou are suggesting that RussianUSSR made Su uses feet instead of meters?Russia has an continues to use a mix of FL and Meters for their ATC what threw me off was the  was at the top like a regular ft altimeter not at the bottom like a typical metric one.Ill hold my hands up here and say yes I was wrong that SU is at m. Ms werent given stealth capability though.gtOf course this map is  reliable.You brought up the map as evidence I point out it actually contradicts your theory you dismiss it as unreliable. Were still back at how you have zero evidence to back your claim that Snizhne was contested territory on July th.gt so why does it matter that AP journalist said that he saw this Buk launcher in Snizhne?You just said theres no evidence when presented with evidence you shrug it off.gtIf you genuinely want to learn of the truth you will read the paperSo close real truthers spell it with an f.

7364304,0,t1_d2f4o0b,gt I always wondered why the DSB only reconstructed the front of the aircraft.Because the photos of the tail section pieces show no damage Because an attack from behind along the length of the aircraft that has the exit holes at the cockpit would require the most impossible accuracy.Because such would be entirely inconsistent with the cockpit damage some of those shrapnel holes on the left side are at near  degreesSo yes once again a great theory if we ignore the evidence we have.,MH17,d2f9rbf,4,t5_32luw

It is only when the two sides are in dispute does either side pretend to care about their lives.
