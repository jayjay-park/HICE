1106986,0,t3_26sgih,Not a parent but graduated  and had a few friends go to Clear View. A couple came back because they hated it others stayed and enjoyed how involved it was. I was one of those kids still am who struggle with  school and the only lifesaver was to be involved in things. If grades are the issue get a tutor like a college student heshe can relate to one on one. Also once I quit taking all the preAPAP classes I was much happier and struggled alot less. Thats just me though but highschool can be hard on a kid without any fun in the day.,clearlake,chu4e3w,7,t5_2safd

3618034,0,t3_31sgzs,Do NOT use A Overhead Doors. Be careful as they have gone by other names including Katy Door Systems. They didnt show up at all the first time. When I called they claimed their receptionist had just been fired because she was stealing clients for her cousins business so they never got my info. Fine whatever I was a little skeptical but scheduled a second appointment.The guy who showed up this time claimed I needed a brandnew opener. I wasnt inclined to buy an expensive new product from them after they stood me up the first time so after the guy left I did my own research online and fixed it in  minutes. ,clearlake,cq4ok6q,5,t5_2safd
