7625154,0,t1_d38qfu0,I had exactly the same issue with a little Harmony I picked up on a whim. Putting nice parts on these guitars is misguided IMHO theyre more fun played as they are. Dont let your repair person talk you into anything besides setting it up as best as they can or maybe a fret dress or new nut only stuff that will make it play better.,Jetsonsguitars,d38xtly,1,t5_2yba8
