ESEA players are always active but you have to pay around  AUD a month for a basic package where as FaceIT is free but is only active on certain hours of the day. On weekdays youll find people on around  and on weekends from about pm till when ever. Also a quick note i that ESEA provides the best anticheat better than VAC. FaceIT still has an anticheat but not the best as ESEA I have seen a couple of people get perma banned from FaceIT though for cheating at the very start of the game ,AusCSGO,crcs29l,2,t5_389ne
