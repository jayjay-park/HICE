990112,0,t1_chgpicb,Thanks for the heads up. In the past I was using channels to avoid  blocking but in practice the performance was substantially worse. The mutex in question should be and in practice is virtually uncontested so its extremely fast. I think it may be possible to remove synchronization altogether because in this application some race conditions are unimportant  whether a sample starts playing on the current iteration or the next doesnt make a practical difference. ,linuxaudio,chgtztf,1,t5_2sd97
1057133,0,t3_267kt2,You may want to try qtractor as your daw.  LV plugins often cause crashes for me in both qtractor and ardour particularly closing the gui for LV plugins.  I stick with LADSPA plugins as much as possible.As for session management I have no preference.  Ive not used Ubuntu Studio.  I use debian Jessie but I have KXStudios repositories enabled.  You may want to look into that.  Heres a link with various recommendations for linux audio production in case you havent seen it. Its written with KXStudio in mind but you or someone else may find it useful.  Good luck.,linuxaudio,chog8ca,5,t5_2sd97

3454444,0,t3_2zsjfs,I second that Carla is nowadays the best and easiest way to go. Try newest releases it recetly had a . beta launched. It will use wine under the hood. It was the first solution that gave me both stable results and bit plugins to work. Id also recommend exploring what is availible in native formats like LV and start replacing these plugins as fast as possible. It will work much better espacially stability performance Have a look at extensive Calf Suite recently upgraded or EQQ It would be great if you provided some examples on what kind of VTS plugins are you trying to use so maybe others can suggest how these can be replaced. Sometimes it might be suprising how people do their audio work done!,linuxaudio,cpm170u,2,t5_2sd97

4874909,0,t1_cu907og,Interesting idea. In this case the client would need to capture the audio somehow and then send it to the server. A browserbased client would have limited capability doing such a thing.Lots of things to think about here. What if there are multiple clients attempting to send to the server?,linuxaudio,cu90rcr,2,t5_2sd97
4877551,0,t1_cu90rcr,gt What if there are multiple clients attempting to send to the server?Accepting just one stream at a time might be fine perhaps letting new streams override existing ones just like new playback commands from a client to the server overrides the previous commands.Im thinking of it as giving each person in the room a remote control to the audio they are listening to.,linuxaudio,cu9cq0d,2,t5_2sd97

6515630,0,t3_435ikr,Here is the thing. Ive NEVER found a program that refused to play audio if pulse is not installed. I see no need for pulse.  Its half finished software that every distro In the world seems to have adopted for some reason...but as far as I can tell in the world of professional audio it only serves to get in the way. Aggressively rip it out and use jack and alsa and things work just fine...Im happy to hear other opinions on the matter but in the end my thought about pulse is what is the point on you?!On the flip side systemd seems to be solid software. Same author widely different opinions across the board about their usefulness ,linuxaudio,czt9mh1,1,t5_2sd97

8227065,0,t3_4rgc4d,Audacious and DeaDBeeF compare the most closely with foorbar. But if you value search prowess and library management features Quod Libet is probably the better option.ampnbspampnbspAudacious vs DeaDBeeF  Both Audacious and DeaDBeeF have configurable modular interfaces with panes for spectrum analysers and a small number of other visualisations. DeaDBeeF has a design mode that takes some acclimation. With Audacious its all resize bars.I like that in both players I can easily control playback with the keyboard especially seeking by using only the arrow keys. Both give you a some control over the size and position of front album art but even after customising everything they both still feel like desktop apps. DeaDBeeF is the more customisable of the two. With some adjustments you can make album art prominent in your queue.ampnbspNeither of these is a consummate music manager Quod Libet is closer but Audacious has an interface for searching and browsing your library. Its fast but basic a textonly list searchable by substring but without regexglobbing. It searches as you type and examines at minimum title album artist album artist and genre. Audacious uses tabs to manage playlists and if you scanin your library you get a Library tab with configurable but unsortable columns. Because playlists are tabs there is a limit to how many you can make and keep it usable. Audacious has a plugin that lets you delete files from within the playlist. Both programmes have very limited tag editors. I dont know whether DeaDBeeF has transcodersAudacious doesnt. If I want to transcode with a GUI I use Sound Converter in GNOME.ampnbspampnbspQuod Libet  Quod Libet is a powerhouse. Its search engine is far more capable than that of Audacious but its also slower due the greater depth and complexity of the index and the search syntax. Where the other two apps like foobar have modular panes that you can resize and rearrange Quod Libet has views that you can switch between. It puts much more emphasis on search navigation and tag editing than most players. Its tag editor is actually quite good and it has lots of poweruser features in general. The search syntax is similar to Calibres it uses artist album and genre panes for filtering results. There are some usability faults The hidden seekbar is regrettable and I wish spacebar was a playpause toggle.ampnbspampnbspKodi vs. Tomahawk  Since you care a lot about album art you should know that Kodi and Tomahawk are more albumart oriented players. They both allow you to browse albums by cover and can even scrape artist photos which I think is a killer feature. I really want Tomahawk to be good but its just so disappointing to me. I keep trying to rightclick on things but theres so little to do. its as if GNOMEs top panel was an audio player. Even though I have album art embedded in almost every track Tomahawk doesnt display most of it. Font antialiasing looks decent on my desktop but in Tomahawk its terrible for some reason. Not good for a player thats trying to be the pretty one. Keyboard control? Ha. No. What are they thinking?ampnbspThe Kodi experience is more visually immersive than any other audio player in Linux. Historically KodiXBMC developers have prioritised video features over audio. A few months ago they announced that they were going to try to improve the audio experience. Kodi is already one of the best options for kioskstyle playback. It is arguably the most richmediaoriented player. Visualisations can run either in the foreground or background and switch as needed. It has several display options for artists albums and background art a new skin can completely transform the UI. You can tell it to start directly in the Music library rather than the home screen. It has smart playlists but you have to type in the values It doesnt gather values from your collection into a combobox.ampnbspampnbspManagement  When you say library manager I think of tagging and file system organisation not just search and navigation. For these things I use MusicBrainz Picard beets which lacks a GUI Kid NautilusFiles and Thunar for its tagaware batch filerenaming plugin. While Picard is my main tagger Kid is useful for manual preprocessing batchtagging and findreplace with regex. I used to use Puddle for certain kinds of tagging like genres because its table layout gives an overview of existing values but Quod Libet also handles this use case well owing to its responsive genre list and exceptional tag editor.ampnbspampnbsptldr DeaDBeeF is the most like foobar but Quod Libet ftw.,linuxaudio,d55xtw8,3,t5_2sd97
