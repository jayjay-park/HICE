8398587,0,t3_4ub4sq,Act IIITheres a good chance that Venus is being aided by the god err sorry the Servant of Death. You need to level the playing field if he is because otherwise you will be wiped out. Finding Janna is an okay start but to be honest youd be best finding someone who can channel a servants power such as Drake or Hannah... Or you could find someone who has defeated a god I mean Servant like Yaska. She just left actually.The Prince stops and Millie speaks Youd be better off finding Janna shes been here recently headed for the Solune city. She is married to Drake. If you want to talk to Yaska go ahead but shes a Death Demon a Demon is someone who works for a servant of course. She works fire Death. OR OR now listen Gaul gets excited OR You could just get them both and pound Venuss stupid face in with the power of two gods! He smiles nodding. The Prince continuesI will aid you but I am bound to my lands my people are more important to me than you issues with my brother. You might start with heading south to the Solune City following Yaska or even heading to the East Metch Kingdom. Im sure Dr. Bradley Jeremy would know what that orb is that was in Jin.What will you do?,dawngale,d5rdbte,1,t5_3f2fo
