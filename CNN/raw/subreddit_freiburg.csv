7936397,0,t1_d475n4m,Thanks for all the info! One of the main reasons Im applying now is so that if I know Im admitted I can have plenty of time to plan and apply for student housing before the school year starts.Might consider that affidavit of support thing but I would need a good amount of money to get started anyway and k EUR shouldnt be hard to make working full time for a year. I looked at loans and found out that Freiburg isnt eligible for FAFSA since it has no tuition but it has deferment status for other student loans you may already have. I will definitely look into those scholarships though Im catholic and do a lot of community service so that could help me out. ,freiburg,d484jsr,1,t5_2t5qg
