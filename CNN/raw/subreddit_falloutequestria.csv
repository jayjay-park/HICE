149632,0,t1_cevgn1p,I want to agree with you and certainly in the games BoS use anything high tech.  However during the invasion of stable  the Loyalist rangers were unable to cut themselves out of containment because they lacked energy weapons. from chapter Calamity trotted in a short time later.  Ahm afraid there aint an easy way t get that door open.  Best bet its t cut through it with a blowtorch and thatll take hours.  He whinnied.  On the plus side seems like thats what the enemy is tryin t do with the S an O wing.  Only those doors are a helluva lot thicker an theres more than one o them.  Best bet weve still got a couple hours bfore theyre through. I forced my body to roll over feeling an uneasy sense of accomplishment when I managed it on the third try.  I found myself staring up at the ceiling rather than at my friends which significantly diminished the victory.  Yknow magical energy weapons would melt through these doors a whole heap ova lot quicker. Steel Rangers battle saddles arent equipped with magical energy weapons SteelHooves replied.  That is an Enclave design. Yeah said Calamity in an odd tone.  Thas what Ah figured.Sounds to me like that was a policy statement from Steelhooves.  My purpose in asking this is because Im working on a story and I want to be as accurate to canon as possible.The Hoofington rangers are a great example and I personally did not mind them having the gear they did given ya know Hoofington. shudder,falloutequestria,cevh2l2,2,t5_2tc7u

1114007,0,t3_26vcxo,As the other poster said you need to hold poses a bit more many movements blend into one all the movements are there but difficult to read. But you have to watch it multiple times because theyre too subtle and not separated enough. Its all good you only need to tweak your timing and poses a little. A Disney animation coach Walt Stanchfield once said If you think it fits always add . Exagerration is what makes animation come to life. Exagerrate your poses  more exagerrate your timing  more your designs etc.To make it more readable the first action of her needs to be more defined. Let her eyes look at one thing first to the right then a little bit toward center like quickly move hold quickly move hold. Then surprise eyes wide Edit Or suddenly let her freeze squint etc. just entirely stop what shes doing before with a quick change in pose hold a just noticeable time like  frames and really SNAP her body around overshoot the direction she wants to look in a tiny bit  frames and settle. Hold again she needs a little bit to react then snap around again and run.Edit Of course in the holds there needs to be the tiniest bit of movement to not make it look artificial. The holds are where the subtlety fits.Edit What also helps Act it out yourself get a camera record yourself. Use the best take as reference as an animator you are basically an actor. Only you put that acting into a drawingmodel.,falloutequestria,chux6gs,2,t5_2tc7u

1778254,0,t3_2ev7zr,Gonna assume I cant plug my own fic so Ill refrain from doing just that. Heres my three carefully worded to avoid spoilersFoE Outlaw by Tofu  I started reading it out of curiosity mostly. Id been getting more into the FOE community and was hearing it mentioned often enough. Browsing the wikia and other related sites had me seeing it often enough that I considered it the fifth of the big sidefics. I started reading it and liked it because of the nonmain characters. The main characters were serviceable but not spectacular and Mach viewpoint character even grated on me at times. Still the world it was built in and the other factions introduced did a lot to suck me in especially Caltrop who will have a bigger role in the ongoing rewrites. Eventually the main characters grew into their roles in the story quite well too. Tofu does a good job of balancing detail with necessity.FoE Wasteland Economics by Doctor Ham  If you want a truly sympathetic protagonist you go to the good doctor. Alloy Shaper is a great addition to the evergrowing cast of Wasteland wanderers for so many spoilery reasons. The storys also written well and does a great job of being its own fic while maintaining the vibe of the greater environment.FoE Sisters by Arowid  This one simply knocks it out of the part with the characters. Arowid has a knack for villains especially. An interesting premise for the main character dynamic and deceptively lengthy chapters because theyre that damn easy to read  were it on paper youd call it a pageturner. I cannot talk this one up enough. I think its great and easily the most enjoyable sidefic Ive read in a good while.,falloutequestria,ck3axyd,8,t5_2tc7u

I should reiterate that I did watch the first season to get better scope into how it tied in with FOE and could see why some would enjoy the show and could join the fandom but I didnt feel an overwhelming desire to continue with the show. Personally my bad blood that held me off from giving the show a shot at first comes not from the internet but from irl. I used to listen to Howard Stern while I was driving and heard the interviews. In one of my public speaking courses some kid even did a speech on MLP...  Im a big fan of a lot of things and idk what it is about ponies but a disproportionate amount of MLP fans tend to make it a cornerstone of their personality rather than an interest. Its a damn cool phenomenon that the show brought such a following in such a short amount of time. I enjoyed the first season and FOE and I am proud to say Ive been around to watch the fandom grow but I just dont feel some kind of desire to continue with MLP outside of FOE,falloutequestria,cp74b3o,1,t5_2tc7u

3872051,0,t1_cqxmdel,I think it is disingenuous to suggest the only people who feel their work extinguished by PH want to reach the level of notoriety of the original thats a strawman if i ever saw one to make out that the people who feel this way must have lofty and unrealistic goals rather than just wanting to be a part of this community. And the reason you have not been aware of it is because usually anyone who feels unable to succeed with PH around either abandons the fandom out of hopelessness or opens their mouth and is dogpiled and bullied out for their apparent illegal feelings.You also seem to make the argument Somber made in his murky thread tantrum that other stories simply are not good enough if they are not getting exposure at least thats what To get exposure they need to have a compelling story reads like to me. I think there are a number of good fics out there that are compelling but are not getting exposure look at the monthly recommendation thread for example.I also believe that once PH is finished its readers will flow to other stories all this fighting started when Somber uttered the words And I wonder who youll blame when I finish and people dont move on to other stories. but thats an aside and part of his apology above. I guess the point here is that if PH finishes and its readers flow on then that does mean that those readers have been tied up all this time the common sentiment is that PH is unfairly long should have ended long ago and other stories written rather than shoehorning their ideas into the goliath and established story that keeping the story going for so long has been tying up readers and stagnating the nonPH parts of the community.I mean if PH ending is good then that does kinda imply that its at least understandable that PH having dragged out so long has been a little bad right?,falloutequestria,cqxnb6o,2,t5_2tc7u

4760533,0,t3_3fydah,Fanfics. Fallout Equestria. Obvs. I only recently played the Fallout games so to me it was a great project to treat it as its own sci fi universe and come up with design languages for all the factions. I can honestly say it set me off on my career path and all the things Ive designed since then have been far more robust as a result.. Fallout Equestria  Anywhere But Here Oh man. Oh man. Irreverent intense and always funny as hell. The only one Ive read that gives the original a run for its money. Go read it. . Eakins Time Loop Trilogy part  moreso than the others. This is just a great story. Personally I think it loses its way a bit in part  but before that its just great writing great character interaction and quite an intricate plot.. The Keepers of Discord    . Tie between FoE Sisters and FoE Wasteland Economics  Both are good in their own ways but both do phenomenal character interaction. Also Sisters has one of the best villains Ive ever seen in Psyker. Shes spoken all of twice in audio logs and shes still one of the most compelling people.I have read fics from other fandoms but in terms of quality none of them really compare.Favourite real works. Use of Weapons by Iain M Banks. This is something else. You know how everyone says FoE has the most dimensional characters theyve ever seen? This goes about characterisation completely differently but it does it better. This does despair and tenacity better. This also has the simplest most powerful climax scene Ive ever read. And as a bonus its all set against the Culture universe which is great. Best book.. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. This is the one that taught me that art can be useful in a realworld sense and that you can use art to suggest and try out ideas and concepts just as you could in reality  depending on how you treat those concepts you can even push people towards pursuing them themselves for themselves. The art changes their mind for you. In everything I do I keep this in mind  anything anyone does who makes films or writes books or even designs machines or buildings can if it is of high enough a level inspire elements of itself in others. Doubt anything I do ever will but still its worth watching out for.. His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman. This is one of those that I keep coming back to and keep finding new meaning in. . The Little Prince by Antoine de SaintExupry or the Lord of the Flies by William Goulding. Between Il est solitaire au desert. Il est aussi solitaire parmi les hommes. and Were going to have fun on this island I think I was set for life.. The Book of Bunny Suicides by Andy Riley.,falloutequestria,ctulyvl,3,t5_2tc7u

6563617,0,t1_czy7mke,wow... i must say that after looking at your work i reconsider that i want mountains... because your alicorn on black is just so expressful!

7535377,0,t3_4ii5i0,I actually got interested in the show for a different reason than most. I found the FoE audio story on YouTube and it just sucked me in.  I started watching the show just so I could get better background understanding of the story. I like to think of the show as the happy path that could have been as compared to the more grimdark of Fallout Equestria. I personally think that Trixies character development in FoE and Project Horizons is astoundingly better than the show.,falloutequestria,d2yqhot,2,t5_2tc7u
