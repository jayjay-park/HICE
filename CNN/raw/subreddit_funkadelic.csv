9238445,0,t1_d8mn870,Turns out I needed  faces because I watched it  times before this response. Thank you so much and it was a nice touch adding a jump cut directly to the song from that concert in your link. I never wanted to hear a band at the height of their sonic powers more than PFunk after watching that video for the first time. Thanks again.,funkadelic,d8n1gw5,2,t5_2zjxm
