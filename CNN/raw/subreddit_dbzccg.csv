2267875,0,t1_clrzst6,Card advantage really.   SSG Goku has super high power levels meaning his physicals hit hard.  His power drew more cards and his level  put him right back on .  Red has  physical attacks with remain on them.  Red also has three attacks that replace themselves though two are energy attacks.  Anger wasnt an issue because the deck didnt focus on it.  Instead it utilized reds cards that use anger as a resource.  When it worked it looked awesome.  Problem was SSG Goku is only super powerful at full and  below full.  And red wants to spend power stages to do its stuff.  ,dbzccg,cls122c,2,t5_2xv63

3536716,0,t3_30pyut,Score DBZ cards for the most part arent valuable. Promos and Ultras tend to be the exception to an extent.One of the potential reasons for this is the community started allowing printed proxies in tournaments after the game went out of print.Sadly for me the only cards I want from the Score game are the Broly Personality cards and theyre extensive.,dbzccg,cpvepib,1,t5_2xv63
3684458,0,t3_32hfbl,Tien really only works in Red amp Black. Ive seen a few ball raditz blue decks but i seriously dont understand why anyone would run an MP that has the potential to banish a ball. Black Raditz is pretty sick. You dont even need to get to level . Black Nappa is awesome but cant handle control decks. Blue Nail Triple threat is fun but honestly u win by survival more so then anything else.,dbzccg,cqc93re,2,t5_2xv63
3883625,0,t1_cqyt3gd,You can find the Rulebook and Corrected Rulings Document CRD there for free.It doesnt sound like youve bought any starters which is good. Youre better off trying to pick up lots of the starter cards online because the starter decks arent legal out of the box and are randomized. The starter cards are unique to starter packs and they are all pretty good so finding lots on EBay or something is usually the most cost effective way to get going.You can also pick up the starter personalities online too.,dbzccg,cqyysz0,0,t5_2xv63

6700319,0,t1_d09sedw, doesnt have the luxury of having attacks that do fifty to sixty life cards of damage. Without that luxury he is just another MP stack that is losing out on Tempo every combat. Dude this isnt score z. This is a balanced well thought out game. You clearly have  idea what youre talking about. I agree about Fashbinder though. That guy sucks. ,dbzccg,d0cdd8b,2,t5_2xv63
