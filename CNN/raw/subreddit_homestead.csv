156763,0,t1_cew0gro,gt Floridafriendly landscaping means... planting the right plant in the right place...  landscape planning and design... proper maintenance.allowing the earth and not agricultural methods to determine the result and the yield. does not seem to match with right plant right place and detailed planning and design.  Proper maintenance can be argued but not cutting your grass and covering it with tarps is a very unconventional method as is not weeding out plants.I see this often where people try to do urban agriculture in this fashion and fail to keep it neat then complain when their neighbors and local government take issue to it.Properly planned urban ag with fruit trees bushes landscaped and decoratively mulched beds of vegetable plants rarely run afoul.  Letting stuff grow wild often does.,homestead,cewac7f,5,t5_2s8lc

621044,0,t3_2191qg,Reading and research are great. However Id like to encourage you to consider playing around with some gardening in the meantime. Skills can take a lifetime to build so theres no reason delay esp if youre in the northern hemisphere! Plus diving into a project can give you something positive to focus on in the here and now. Too many people just dream. It doesnt have to be big or huge could just be growing a few fresh herbs in a bucket. Youre in the right subreddit theres others you might be interested in including rgardening rbackyardchickens and rbeekeeping I recommend reading through some of the older entries here.You may not have to give up things or at least not as much as one might think. Theres as many different ways to do homesteading as there are homesteaders. Some people want to return to a preindustrial way of life some are prepping for an eventual apocalypse others just want a bit of peace and to live amongst the beauty of nature etc. Some people want to do everything by hand want the exercise so they chop up things with axes others prefer to let technology do the work so they have time for other things and pull out the chainsaw. Some people make cabins from scratch others most just refurbish something a bit run down. It all really depends on what you want and what you can get access to. As for tools and animals that depends a lot of what direction you want to go in what part of the world you want to settle what you like to eat. Its okay if you dont know the answers to any of these things. Everyone starts in the same place at the beginning.,homestead,cgav3b1,3,t5_2s8lc

The only way to get them back in the pen is to allow them to come in the house to watch tv like I use to let them do when they were kids never introduce your goats to the couch and tv they remember forever they also love to eat all of the chicken feed and any plants near the fence but they do a good job cleaning up any branches we throw in.Flip side of my goats are the ones I work with here at college.

877050,0,t3_244y0j,You pretty much have to treat it like a lion or tiger.  Meaning that you have to respect the fact that the animal has the ability to kill you and that they can understand your fear of them.   People handle lions and tigers all the time people handle bulls all the time but you need to be paying attention around it because the minute you turn your back you will regret it.  Ive worked around Hereford and Charolais bulls that were very docile and Holstein and Angus bulls that were mean but you cant trust a breed any more than you can trust a race of human  some are fine and some will kill you just for the sport.  I dont know what kind of person of questionable intelligence keeps a bull as a pet but if she raised it from a calf it knows her smell all of them it knows her voice and it knows that she provides it with food and water.  It does not know you.  It could perceive you as another food provider or as a threat and when its pushing against you it is testing you to find out how you react and it will continue to do so.  Theres a reason why they call the human version bullying.  I am by no means an expert but I would recommend that you either completely avoid the bull perhaps living somewhere where it cannot look in your windows WTF or if you are destined to live in that arrangement youre going to have to let the bull know that you are the boss.  Suggest to your roommate that you help feed it and then talk to it when youre feeding and watering it so it knows your voice but talk calmly as those links have mentioned and you need to show confidence and superiority.  Its obviously being treated like a pet so treat it like a pet back  you need to maintain that you are a master equal to your roommate.  If shit starts to go south you better be ready with a fist to its nose dont hit it on the head youll only break your hand and make it mad or a taser but if youre that close to it youre out of options.  It can outrun you as others have mentioned so stay close to the fence if you have to be in the pen.  Those are my experiences best of luck to you and your two roommates. ,homestead,ch3z34a,5,t5_2s8lc

1369985,0,t3_29r2it,The stumbling block for most people is land  home  shelter to live in while building a home  income amp time to manage it all are just completely out of reach.  So dont strive for having it all or perfection.  Start with small steps all leading in the same direction.Now for the big three plus oneLand  great if you can but will it exhaust your resources and prevent you from moving ahead?  If so try to find a parcel you can rent barter labour or share with someone.  If you can swing land look especially for parcels with existing structures often a structure badly in need of repair or what to most would seem a loss can greatly depress the price of a piece of land and as a bonus there may well be some usable infrastructure such as a well or access to power. If nothing else it might provide you with shelter enough or extra building materials later if it isnt what you need or could be repurposed.Home  Start small with something that can be expanded used for another purpose or sold when more permanent accommodations can be readied and this includes structures campers sheds shell cabins or a myriad of other things that could be found or bought and brought onto the site and then improved upon in addition to building on site from scratch.  In the case of not having your own land or there is even a slight possibility that one day you will relocate make your home so that it can move with you this isnt limited to having wheels there are such things as forklifts and lowboy trailers that one can have a structure moved.  Water  great if you can a great expense if absent.  If its not present water can be toted in from elsewhere from a public spring or even a nearby business that would be so kind to allow access to a hose or that charge a modest fee for it.  Certainly too rain can be collected if it isnt prohibited such as many places in the west and maybe later on you can afford to drill a well or if a water delivery service is available obtain a storage tank.Sanitation and hygiene  Putting in a septic system is likely something far down the road but you can certainly easily deal with greywater and for the rest if allowable do an outhouse composting using public facilities for that purpose or if nothing else go the honeybucket routine for the time being and figure out an appropriate way of disposal should that be composting for general use burning it or simply dealing with it as you would your other nonrecyclable trash.  Think of it this way how do you deal with it when camping?.  For hygiene of course its as simple as a wash cloth and some water setting up a gravity shower finding a place such as an RV park or a gym membership where you can take showers at a reasonable cost or knowing someone that would allow you to do so at their home other things can come later.Depending upon where you are in your journey maybe a good place to start perhaps the library is with the Nearings The Good Life for inspiration followed up by Jean Hay Brights Meanwhile Next Door to the Good Life for a jolt back to reality and just to round it out fill in the cracks with Melissa Colemans This Life is in Your Hands.  Then move on to the tons of information available like Mother Earth archives Storey publications cooperative extension publications from your local university many can be found online at various state university sites books from libraries and used book stores or even Amazon on homesteading structures gardening and crafts and see what is feasible and workable and dont forget there are a lot of resources in the public domain that are in ebook form too. The most important thing of all though is to remain flexible as possible and that includes doing things that can be changed have multiple uses and being able to take advantage of a situation deal or offering that might alter your plans but advances you in the right direction.  And being flexible also means looking ahead to seeing other possibilities or doing things in a way that accepts that we too grow and change and part of the journey is making some mistakes or not being able to see the future.  Some things will work out fine in others your needs will change over time and youll find some things are just adequate which could be improved upon or simply dont work out for instance can you change your kitchen to fit a new or different sized appliance do you find you dont need a desk are you getting older or got injured and cant use a ladder any more chickens cant cope with the climate but rabbits can etc. so try to do things in an adaptable way that allows change expansion elimination or repurposing.  And along the way its not a bad idea to collect up things or replace what you have with things that will be more useful later downsizing what you dont need conserving what you can evaluating what is truly necessary useful and extravagance.      ,homestead,cio0ky6,3,t5_2s8lc

2573568,0,t3_2p99aa,A couple other considerations . Access. Can you get to the land? Is it near a road? Is the land so steep that the road still does not make it accessible? Do you have to drive through a neighbors property to get to your property easement? Does your neighbor have an easement on your property to get to their property? Easements will reduce the cost. It will also increase the potential for conflict with your neighbor. Who is going to maintain the private road?. Water Do you have water on your property? Does you neighbor have an agreement with the previous owner to access the water on your property? Look into the water laws by state. Some states usually out West do not allow you to catch rainwater or dam up a streamriver on your property. . Other rights mineral timber oil gas etc. Sometimes the previous owner sold those rights off separate from the land or retained those rights for themselves. You buy the land and ten years from now a stranger informs you that they have the right to clear cut all the timber on your land. You dont want unpleasant surprises.. Property taxes. Building codes. Some areas are relaxed about what structures you build on your land. Other areas will force you to demolish a building that doesnt have a permit and conform to their strict building codes. .

3706909,0,t1_cqecl2h,As a goat expert I found this article to be rather misleading and full of some incorrect information. Properly breeding goats is not something I would call inexpensive or even encourage anyone to do unless they are  committed. And trust me...your goat will not protect your chickens from any predator and can often end up a meal themselves. Thats udderly har har ridiculous to even say. Stuff like this does a disservice to a very fascinating species that has an overwhelming lack of official research to follow which is why care standards are all over the map and there is a massive amount of incorrect information that continues to be parroted among breeders and keepers. Its why I no longer am part of any goat forum or group with the exception of rgoats because I had my fill of trying to help people and trying to present my factual information that I work very hard to get that is literally my job to get only to be told Im wrong and figuratively spit upon.However thankfully word has spread and people know where to find me when they need help and I am able to hold events like our upcoming Dairy Day so that I can keep helping people who truly want to educate themselves and learn. ETA Oh...and for the record. Goats do not want to mow your lawn and should be discouraged from eating grass from their own pasture. If you can. Its pretty much impossible unless they have other more desirable food sources. Goats did not evolve to put their heads down towards the ground where the internal parasites that wreck such havoc on their systems reside. They evolved to lift their head and eat from above. Anyone who talks about how goats are great lawn mowers are showing very clearly how little they actually know about the species.Which is fine  one can learn. One can correct beginner mistakes and grow. However lately it seems every person around the block is suddenly an expert after six months on an acre of land with a couple of goats or chickens and they start writing articles encouraging the spread of that misinformation I deal with quite often.  ,homestead,cqeta05,3,t5_2s8lc

Others talk about an electric wire to keep the piggies in a given area. So speaking of given areas if I have ish acres to offer I understand dividing that area up is a good thing.

Hawaii is one of the only states with leasehold lands. Fee simple is ownership leasehold is a trap. A lot of property listed here is leasehold and not actual land for sale.

Corporate governments are exactly the same as any other business be it McDonalds or Sears yet they happen to have names like County of  or State of   you can look up the business  for any governmental office for example most police are registered as nonprofit corporations.Governments by and for the people are public services rendered by public servants NOT corporate officers employed by corporate entities.  Any attempt to collect a fine due to a code infraction is nothing more than failing to follow the equivalent of a dress code outlined in an employee handbook.  There is a big difference between legal codes and lawfulness.  If you are not an employee of a corporation they have no authority to extort money from you unless you sign a contract with them.  Often times fear is used to coerce people into thinking they must sign a contract which lawfully binds the two parties.  Every contract must have consent  your signature a contract based on force is not valid under international uniform commercial code law.I highly recommend this book written by a judge in Alaska that clearly exposes this corporate fraud behind governments and their attempt to force people to consent into contracting with their businesses.,homestead,cvd3gff,1,t5_2s8lc

5908139,0,t3_3w4u95,I live on five acres four of which are wooded.  Our area is mostly forests and our clear acre is where we have our chickens garden apple trees berry bushes etc.  We tap trees for maple syrup and we have bee hives set back in the woods.  I would like to start raising meat rabbits and down the line we will have alpaca for wool.I doubt its very easy to be self sufficient on two acres.  I mean truly self sufficient thats likely impossible.  I would start with a few basics though. Set up rain collection.   gallon cubic water totes are cheap on craigslist.  Make sure they are food grade.  Two of those off your house will get you garden water and in an emergency people water. Plant some fruit trees.  At least three apple varieties that can pollinate each other.  Then maybe some pear plum or persimmon depending on your growing zone. Perennials! Dedicate space to these wonderful plants that keep on giving.  Asparagus strawberries certain onions herbs.  You can even mix in greens like mustards that easily self propagate when allowed to go to seed. Focus on fertility.  Your annual veg beds need to be constantly renewed.  Even fruit trees need some love.  Remember soil eats.  Chickens are great as their poop really helps the compost.  Know your dynamic accumulators like dandelion and comfrey.  Plant comfrey around your fruit trees.  Use their leaves as a live mulch.  Know your trees.  Trees are dynamic accumulators with deep deep roots to mine all sorts of wonderful minerals.  Their leaves then fall and are a great addition to compost and mulch.  Just watch out for black walnut and other species that have growth inhibiting chemicals. MULCH!  This is an addendum to fertility.  Mulch mulch mulch.  It keeps your soil moist and fed.  It holds back weeds.   Use straw.  Use leaves.  Hell use newspaper.  Just mulch! Chickens are a great start.  I read down this thread you fear too many eggs.  No. Such. Thing!  If you cant eat them you trade them.  I would scramble them and feed them back to my chickens before Id throw them away.  My goodness never throw them away!  Do not wash them or wipe them down and you will not even need to refrigerate them.  Eggs last weeks.  I sell them all summer.  If you get another animal like a pig you could always feed them the extra.  You could fence half an acre and raise one pig per year.  Buy a wiener for forty bucks in the spring.  Fence half an acre for him and let him rip it up and poop all over it.  Feed him well and let him have the scraps extra eggs and shells etc.  Make bacon for winter.  Next year move the pig paddock over and plant squash on last years pig pen. Leg your chickens free range by day and as someone else said lock them into fort knox at night.  Remember chicken wire keeps chickens IN not predators OUT.  Use hardware cloth or welded wire fence on coops which you can double with chicken wire.  My birds coop has an indoor space and a run.  Combined they get about eight to ten square feet per bird.  I hate seeing cramped chooks.  I let them run by day in a fenced area that is pretty big.  Just keep them away from gardens.  But you can grow greens lettuces etc along their fence lines so they can nibble.,homestead,cxu38vw,6,t5_2s8lc

6463875,0,t1_cznse48,I cant tell you anything about their milk firsthand yet wont be able to for at least  more breeding seasons. The only Kiko I currently have is getting ready to replace my old buck. What I can tell you is when the people who started the breed got to work all of the selected dams were from wild feral New Zealand stock and all of the sires were Nubian Saanan and Toggenburg  three of the most successful milk breeds in the world. Ive seen it reported though I cant remember where right now that they produce around  of a gallon daily. Since you plan to cull anyway it should be very little extra effort to continuously select for higher milk production in your herd given their vigorous growth rate the kids should provide you with plenty of meat.One of the main things that sold me on them is that they very reliably pass on a lot of their best traits no matter what they are bred to. So another option would be to mix a herd with Kikos and other more specialized milk goats to give a bit of a jump start toward your ultimate desires. One thing that I have been warned about with this is that even in utero Kiko kids grow very quickly and can overwhelm a dam resulting in stillbirths. I cant say whether or not that is true but I have heard it from a source I trust. In theory the easiest way to avoid that is to choose your Bucks from the milk breeds and pick Kiko does. For my own part Ill be taking my chances I stumbled across a buck that it was impossible to pass up thankfully I am no stranger to helping goats deliver I got plenty of practice from one subpar doe that was given to me.,homestead,cznwqox,2,t5_2s8lc

Any recipe that calls for broth or stock is a good use or use a base for gravy sauce chili or as ricebeanpotatocrockpot liquid. Im not a soup fan myself. As for the meat I often shred it and use it in a casseroletamaletacoscurry or something flavorful. Use anywhere you would use cannedpre cooked chicken or tuna. Older free range hens can be gamey and stringy but protein is protein. I only bother with the easiest meat. By the time the stock is done the bones are soft enough to chop up with a knife. I grab the big chunks of meat for myself and roughly chop the rest up to feed back to the other hens dogs and BSFs. Whatever isnt eaten at the end of the day gets buried under a nutrient accumulator or heavy feeder.They really arent worth the effort IMO of frying. The meat is stringy enough to floss with! Ive never tried smoking. I usually let hens go for three years or more. I usually dont cull until they get too old to turn the deep litter. They usually lay every other day still at that point so the tilling and manure is a good benefit. ,homestead,d381ae7,1,t5_2s8lc

The only thing thats not on the cleared  acres is the pig pen and paddock.In absolute reality my potato patch is  x  with  rows of  plants each so  plants. The patch right next to it measures  x  and this patch contains the broccoli cauliflower peas beets and carrots. A double row of strawberries separates the potato patch from the other garden patch.Another garden patch that we just established this year has about a dozen squash mounds with  plants per mound vines being trained in opposite directions as well as our extra tomato plants that didnt fit in the greenhouse about  plants. The bulk of this patch also has our small test plots of wheat barley and corn and by small I mean small... the corn patch is only like  plants and the wheat and barley each measure about  x .For my fruit I have exactly  raspberry canecrowns  blueberry bushes  currant bushes  red  white and  black and  small fruit trees  plum  apple and  cherry.For the greenhouse its quite small and fits a grand total of  tomato plants and  pepper plants.Last but not least the asparagus bed established this year is about  crownsplants.All this being said I have no actual irrigation system in place but you can be sure thats going to be an investment for next year! The garden patches that can be watered directly I just water with a sprinkler so thats the  main patches potatoes and garden veg. Same with the cereal grains.

I was raised in Montana been around animals s of my life though they belonged to the Ranchers I worked for. Mangs are actually a  year pig to slaughter. We have an AMAZING group of folk and neighbors that live in our community who have been guiding us with all our decisions. I will be going through my first pig harvest harvesting and butchering in the next few weeks with one of these neighbors.The difference between a guy a Jiffy Lube opening a Data Center and my Farm is that my Farm is not for profit its for feeding my family. I am not offering to house other peoples animals here. We plan on the goats for a few areas between our pastures and the house where there is fencing almost  high just so I can avoid the weed eating. I FULLY understand I will be mowing. We own two riding lawn mowers and with the Wife and I both riding can get it done in . hours.We are not looking to purchase a tractor yet. We have access to every tractor and implement possible some of these Farmers that have been helping us own s of acres not  like us and are VERY generous with it. The Farmers that weve met have all extremely generous with knowledge transfer though I must admit I have had to work on some of their computers and assisting with the current Alfalfa harvesting weve had  harvests already this summer.I appreciate the Critical Thinking!

With any old wood stove and well seasoned hard wood you can easily keep them a good  degrees above the ambient exterior temperature. The walls are a thin membrane with not too much R value but as long as they are well protected against drafts you can stay comfortable in temperatures as low as  Fahrenheit as long as you can commit to keeping your stove going which is a full time job in winter months.

8979778,0,t3_538rhk,I agree  with the poster that said get the tractor that will run the implements you want to run.A tiller and a rotary mower require on avg  pto HP per working foot of implement. That L only has  ish pto HP so realistically you are stuck with  implements that will not cover the tire tracks. Since you are on sandy loam you could probably push it and go for  but you have to remember that doing that means your tractor is taxed to its max every time you run an implement.  A tractor run that way will wear out faster and have more down time in the long run. Also  if you want to run any deep tillage tools for your cropsgarden  you need to consider drawbar hp.  YOure looking at  hp per chisel point   hp per moldboard and up to  hp per ripping shank.  That little kubota pulls less than  at the drawbar. Personally  i would want to be able to run  pto implements if i were you even though its only  acres.  will save a lot of time and it will fully cover your tire tracks which makes mowing and tilling soo much easier.  That means minimum  pto hp. That pretty much puts you in a  hp tractor. This size tractor will also let you pull a double bottom plow or a big  ripping shank which can double as a polypipe or cable layer for irrigation or power supplyFor your needs  i think a HST transmission would be best but i wouldnt let the transmission be the most important factor. I think the most important feature is a quick attach skid steer style loader and a set of rear remotes.  The quick attach is important so that you can quickly change between a bucket pallet forks and nothing  having no attachment up front is almost as good as dropping the loader completely off and it is waaay easier and faster.  In fact the loader on my tractor is quick attach AND quick detach just pull two pins and disconnect the hydraulic lines and you can drop the whole loader and I use the quick attach feature all the time but i have yet to use the quick detach feature.  The remotes are important to be able to run a lot of drawbar implements with a lift cylinder. Also the hydraulic pump in your tractor is by itself a very valuable piece of equipment and there are all sorts of hydraulically powered machines that you can buy or fabricate bending punching  pressing  milling  grinding chipping etc that can be run off the remotes either attached to the tractor or just freestanding nearby with the aid of long hydraulic lines.  The hydro transmission is really nice though.  It grants the tractor more capability than creeper gears. You have the ability to run a pt trencher or to skid something large and heavy really slowly... like . mph slow. At that speed you can pretty much leave the tractor to its self if you have cruise control just need to check the steering every minute or so while you manage logs or posts for rollers if the structure doesnt have built in skids. I also concur with the advice to forget about a backhoe attachment. There are better ways to trench or lay pipe and I wouldnt get one to install my own septic field  wells and septic are two things best left for the professionals.  If you plan on digging footings for outbuildings or installing any culverts it would be really nice but it probably wont pay in the long run vs hiring somebody in for a specific job.  Id rather put the money in to a bigger tractor or higher quality implements. Ive worked on    acre alt ag farms in the MidAtlantic for almost  years now and Ive heard MANY a veggie farmer suggest a  hp HST tractor with a loader as the do anything  workhorse for market farming most who have been at it a while also keep a big tractor for primary tillage and a small cultivating tractor like the offset version of the L or an A or a cub I happen to believe this is also the perfect size for a homestead.  It also happens to be a relatively expensive tractor.   I couldnt afford  hp w QA loader and remotes in hst so i bought a  hp shuttle shift for my property... I think you should be able to find something in that  hp range though for under k though if you are willing to be patient. Edit to get under k you would probably have to buy an older tractor without a QA loader and then buy a QA adapter bracket for the loader pins for .  Then you have to have a welder fix up the old bucket to work with the QA system for an extra couple hundred or just buy a new bucket when you get a set of pallet forks if you can afford it. ,homestead,d7r8dk0,20,t5_2s8lc

We have been in this house two years now and were fairly new to this lifestyle. We didnt grow up doing any of these things.From March to October Im watering my plants with the hose attachment nearly every day. We always have peppers tomatoes strawberries herbs and flowers. Some years we grow cucumber beans and other misc. plants. We have a long season in zone B. I save seeds from my best plants. I have a grow light set up in the basement storage room. Some years I start my own plants from seed and other years Im lazy and buy starts.Each morning I have to open the chicken ramp. I work three days a week and if Im off Ill let them out to free range for a while. At night I close their ramp to keep them safely upstairs in their coop. Every few days I refill food and water troughs and scoop the poop out of their nest boxes. Three chickens require very little work. We get  eggs a day which is plenty for us. I usually share with family and coworkers.I try to visit you pick farms when the season comes around. Well pick mass amounts of strawberries and blueberries to can jam. Any leftover fruit is eaten fresh or frozen. I usually just make a batch of  jars at a time. This year I canned pickles and peppers for the first time. It is a day long thing and I make quite a mess. Ill make a loaf of bread and along with a jar of jam it makes a delightful gift! I do most of the housework and I like to schedule it for myself throughout the week.

Would it be enough to power a third or fourth electric space heater without tripping any fuses or causing any electrical cords or plugs to get hot?I too live in an RV without a working furnace in the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest. I have only  amp power. I have two electric space heaters for heat both kept at halfheat only never fullheat as that causes the AC plugs to overheat and can catch fire. Works well for all but the coldest week or two for the year. If I had more amperage Id just get another  space heaters for supplemental heat. Got mine cheap from the thrift shop. Craigslist has them too. And Ebay Amazon.But since I dont I use a Mr. Heater Portable Buddy propane heater. With a propane hose a hose filter and a pound propane tank.It is rated safe for indoor use uses no electricity and with the electric heaters and propane heater all going keeps me nice and warm through even the coldest winter nights. I only need it for a week or two each year.Home Depot and Walmart and Lowes usually has themcall first. Problem is this being a cold snap probably every single store in the area is is completely out of heaters. So just order online on eBay or Amazon or Mr.Heaters own site Get expedited shipping.Nice and toasty  Might even be cheaper in the long run than using that furnace.

Heck cats can claim responsibility for up to  of mammal bird and lizard extinctions on islands and theyre considered one of the top  invasive species. In places like Australia its so bad that cats make it almost impossible to reintroduce threatened species back into places theyre extinct. Cats also live longer indoors. Theyre less likely to get hit by vehicles tangle with other animals including other cats and become wounded or sick. Id make the argument that instead of being worried about your cat killing critters that if you cant provide an environment indoors where your cat doesnt need to go out for stimulation then one shouldnt own a cat.

My parents did this back in the s and I looked into it a few times in my adult life but ended up buying property with a house that the prior owners had built Ive done a fair bit of remodelingaddition but never built a house.  The price difference is usually less than you think but certainly cheaper and cheaper up front. Evaluate the cost of a lot without a home keeping in mind that youll need building permits  code inspectionengineering services water or well electricity sewerseptic materials and labor that you need helpoutsource for.  As others have mentioned odds are high that you will want to contract out foundation hvac watersewer to the site. Framing roofing windows interior plumbing and electrical are all things you can mostly learndo yourself if you havewant those skills but you will need to hire help for some parts of them to have additional hands or for expert advicesignoff. Ive done roofing by myself and it is arduous.  And as others have said you can still save a lot of money and get more exactly what you want with a sitebuilt house that you have a contractor frame and rough in but you do the finish work. Because finish work eats up a lot of skilled time you need skills and even more time if you do it yourself.  Your financing options are much shorterterm for landonly and for construction costs. If you were planning on buying any of this on a year mortgage a preexisting home is the only way.If you are excited about tackling the skills of home construction an existing home that is too small but wellsited and with the services you need already in place is a much less daunting way to build into what you need.,homestead,dedi4ds,0,t5_2s8lc

11141129,0,t3_5z2a76,Masters of Piblic Health here.  His statement is a false equivalence.  Getting sick from raw milk is an acute problem while eating too many twinkles is a chronic problem.  The issue with raw milk is food safety not that it is inherently bad for us.  There are so many points of contamination from cow to store that it is almost impossible to control all the steps closely and cleanly enough to prevent contamination.  If youre milking at home and drinking that day great go for it.  But if youre selling that milk you have to make other assurances through bottling transporting and selling that milk to prevent contamination.  Without pasteurization thats really not feasible to ensure a safe product.  And not to dis any Farmers but I dont know that any of them have food safety or public health training to know control points and food safety measures.  Twinkies on the other hand are manufactured in a controlled environment with dyes additives and preservatives packaged in a convenient air tight mylar filled with nitrogen gas.  They have been baked to a certain temperature for a certain time and samples of batches are pulled and tested for shelf life and presence of bacteria.  There is literally such a small chance of acute issues with a Twinkie thatd youre more likely to get killed from a sharknado than get sick from a Twinkie.  Now  years of twinkies later your heart may seize up but youll never encounter a bad Twinkie.  Now twinkies are an extreme example of food safety practices mixed with preservatives to make a shelf stable product that could sit on a shelf and outlive some dogs and be fine to eat.  But I also feel it is reckless to disregard all food safety practices in order to sell something in a very raw form.   If youre doing it for personal consumption knock yourself out.  The most you may injure is yourself and family.  But if youre selling it and have the potential to affect hundreds of people.  That is why we have food safety laws to protect people from accidents related to food.  ,homestead,deuu3gn,86,t5_2s8lc

11680791,0,t3_66jvu1,I recently purchased a house on  acres.  Mistakes I made are    The land is moderately sloped in parts and steep in others.   At the time of buying I fell in love with the house and the location but it really is an effort to move around a sloped property on a daily basis.  Flat land would be more pleasant but its also in higher demand.    Rocks!  There are large rocks all over my cattle paddocks.   Which makes slashing the grass with a tractor difficult and prone to damaging blades.  Im going to need an excavator or bulldozer to get rid of them so that the paddocks are maintainable.    Not doing soil and water testing.  Its costs to have it done but could save buying a total dud if you want a productive edible garden. Good things I did with buying this land   Ensuring there were dwelling entitlements with the local council.   Meeting the neighbours and asking them about the history of the land and the area.  My neighbours on all sides have turned out to be wonderful people who are helpful and considerate.   We have kids as well so having some similarly aged kids as neighbours was a big bonus.    Buying a house up on a hill on sloped land was a very good thing during the major flood disaster that hit the area recently.  Flat land was flooded out.    I conducted a mobile phone and Internet network speed test inside the house.  Working over the Internet is working out great.

11696696,0,t3_66u6bz,There are literally thousands of goat breeders and theyve all got at least one happy customer who will swear theyre the best. You need to decide what breed you want and what qualities are important to you. I would recommend watching the county fair and talk to the Hers about their goats and where they got them. They should give a pretty good idea of who you can trust locally and if you just want a few you may even be able to buy from them. No they dont need to be registered to sell but if you or buyers want to show them theyll need to be registered and disbudded. Many ethnic markets buy barbacoa and if youre selling for meat they dont need to be registered. It would probably be worth your time to start with registered goats to start off with high quality foundation stock. Yes the loafing shed sounds fine as long as you have a good fence to keep out predators. Dont forget about local dogs theyre the usual suspects. If you have frigid winters you can insulate with straw bales. Honestly if you know what youre looking at you should be able to doctor and vaccinate on your own pretty easily. Eventually youll know your goats well enough to know if they arent feeling well and do need a vet. You can always find a friend or mentor who knows about goats for moral support. Dont forget to trim hooves and at least sand the tip of their horns if they have them. I would have a vet look at them when you first get them and run your own Johnes and CAE blood tests though. Ive seen a scared goat kid  m or so flat foot jump a five foot fence but most of the time the fence was fine. Make sure there arent any feeders or anything they can use as stairs to hop out. You might line the existing fence with an electric fence which will also add protection from predators. More importantly dont use a fence they can put their heads through. They WILL stick their heads through and if they have horns theyll probably be stuck. If they get panic or get exhausted they may strangle themselves. They would go right under barbed wire. If they have enough space flat land is okay but many people add things for enrichment. Kids especially enjoy them by make sure there arent any small spaces their hooves can slip through or theyll break their legs.

And yes if youre not the right ethnicity and born within  miles you might as well represent an adverse occupational force.  Sometimes when I try to explain the environment there to people they think Im being racist against Mexicans.  These people have never lived Northern NM because if they had theyd know calling a Norteno a Mexican is taken like your insulting them.  I get it they are actually Spanish descendants and theyve been there since Cortez.  I could even accept that they dont like outsiders if only I didnt feel as if they saw me as a rich gringo and tried to take advantage of me every chance they got.But on the lighter side of things it is absolutely beautiful there and the weather is almost always perfect.  I did meet some really nice and helpful people and several of them were actually locals.  They tended to be older generations I dont know why the younger ones had chips on their shoulders.  I dont know what county you live in but if its Rio Arriba I would highly advise against any involvement with the county government over this issue unless absolutely necessary and only with the aid of a lawyer you sincerely trust.  Ive dealt a lot with Rio Arriba and know several people who work for the county.  Lets just say it reminds me of Russia when I was there in the late s you might think you know what corruption is but until youve dealt with Rio Arriba CO or Russia you dont.Good on you for fixing the fence and moving on.  Snap a couple pictures write down the dates and file them away with the hope youll never need them.  Best of luck my friend!Edit I forgot a simple trick that I learned in NM.  Assuming the role of ignorance and asking someone elses opinion often eases tensions quite a bit and can put you on their better side.  Plus you actually can learn quite a bit in the process.  In your case you might want to consider asking him how to build a better fence.  Never mind that you can already build a fence and it makes you look like a doof.  If hes at all approachable and I would believe you if you said hes not do consider dropping by and asking him if theres anything he knows of that will keep cattle out.  This will  make him feel as though youre on his team since youre after the same objective  placate his simpleminded need for superiority.
