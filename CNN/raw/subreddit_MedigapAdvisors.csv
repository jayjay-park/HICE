6862808,0,t3_3lfdbd,Question about being a teen and car insurance?I am  now I am taking my drivers test in about a week. My boyfriend said that when he got his licence he was automatically added to his mom and dads car insurance. Well I was wondering would it be the same for me. Because This might be a little confusing   I was adopted by my birth mothers boyfriends mom and i live with her and her mom. No one in the house has a car or car insurance and my birth mother doesnt have any custody of me but she does have car insurance and my birth father has half custody of me and he has car insurance. So.... ha ha my question in general is when get my license will I be added to any ones insurance? Or will I have to get my own? Ha ha ALSO If I do have to get my own what would be the best and cheapest insurance for me? I wouldnt want full coverage I would just get P.I.P. Please and thank you so much!,MedigapAdvisors,d0u7jli,1,t5_36alu

So how many years do you have to be driving for before the costs fall below  per year. Also is it worth taking pass plus as it costs about  and apparently saves you  so unless the saving carries over to future years i cant see the point. Thoughts???,MedigapAdvisors,d0w26eo,1,t5_36alu
