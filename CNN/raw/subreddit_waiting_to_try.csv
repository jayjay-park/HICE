190851,0,t1_cezw8f3,I hope its okay to comment here. I think what you should do to help your situation is to talk to your OB or find a new one about what happened during your csection and why it was so traumatic for you. You can NEVER absolutely avoid a csection sometimes the need for them comes up. VBac is an awesome goal though. Make a csection plan that will help the problems you had with your first one and find someone who will help you make that happen. They dont have to be traumatic. If you were in an emergency situation of course it was but in that case maybe the thing you need to come to terms with is the emergency itself rather than your birth.Hope Im not stepping on toes. I just went through a traumatic stillbirth and I am working through a lot of it with a therapist.,waiting_to_try,cf06eql,2,t5_2yge0

My husband and I are in very much the same situation. As much as id like to convince him towards my timeline Id hate to think he was making the wrong decision for himself. I wouldnt want to have a child with a man who wasnt ready.its big. its the BIGGEST decision and shouldnt be made lightly.

1660097,0,t3_2dc49t,Welp since my post was the last post posted and mentioned this Ill chime in.I agree.  .  And for what its worth my comment was completely a joke.  When we got pregnant the first time he was devastated.  He was convinced it would ruin his life.  He was afraid he wouldnt be able to get his degree he did.  We were in the middle of a rough patch and it was a scary time to get pregnant and he didnt want kids for at least  years.  Surprise babies are hard.  It ended up being amazing for our relationship and our life and we cant imagine our life without her now but when I imagine telling him Im pregnant next time... I want nothing but a HUGE SMILE on his face.  I dont want panic.  I want pure joy.  Among a million other reasons this is a huge part of why I would never ever surprise him.  It was great to see him come around and realize how great this would all be but Id prefer he come around before getting preggers next time. ,waiting_to_try,cjof1v4,4,t5_2yge0

I didnt lose much if anything on it I was at  when I started and maybe got to . but I didnt have too much to lose and I probably would have needed to watch my portions more than I did. You are what you eat and eating clean really makes you feel better. Im planning on doing another Whole after Jan  Im not bothering with the holidays  too many parties. My big problem on Whole is that I like alcohol.  Like a glass of wine or a beer a day level.  Thats the only thing I miss on Whole and I just need to deal with it.  I figure Whole will be good training for pregnancy in that regard although Im worried if I start declining alcohol people will start questioning which will feed the baby rabies!,waiting_to_try,cmm7xa5,2,t5_2yge0

Its also worth consideration our boy name is Gavin Michael.But they lost their baby so I cant exactly say anything about it. But really did they have to steal whats basically my name when we were already planning on using it and they knew that?

4767327,0,t3_3g5spm,If you are using NFP then you are purposely not getting pregnant. I understand how it can feel like maybe theres a chance for an accident but that is what you and your husband have specifically decided to avoid. I have totally been there too where the idea of an accident just seems so enticingit takes the control out of your hands and instead of having to make the decision about what time is best to actually have a child you just have to deal with the reality of having a child. However it sounds like your husband is really set on waiting until next yearand he wants to claim that control of deciding when the time is right to have a baby instead of just letting things happen naturally. Having an accident could be doubly hard for him because  he didnt feel ready and  he didnt get to plan it. I know you guys have talked about it but if you are this upset about it you are clearly not on the same page as him and thats the kind of thing that really calls for talking about it some more. Maybe you could approach the conversation from a place of this is how I feel not so much please change your mind so we can have babies now if that makes sense. ,waiting_to_try,ctvgrfi,4,t5_2yge0

6997531,0,t1_d19g2l6,I really like that article. And while yes being in shape and healthy and a healthy weight is very important for your health and a babys its also true that constantly beating yourself up about body image can do a whole lot of harm to both you and baby. Ive never been overweight so I cant claim to fully understand what thats like however I have serious body image issues and have struggled with weight Im very short so every pound shows and at times I do end up on the high end of normal and I have had therapists suggest body dysmorphic disorder as part of my anxiety and depression.Not only does beating yourself up like that hurt your mental health but in turn it hurts your physical health. Youre less likely to make really healthy choices and the stress can weaken your immune system and cause lots of issues.So yes be healthy but be healthy in your brain too and that might mean not pushing so hard on weight loss especially if the doctor has said youre ok. ,waiting_to_try,d19ihze,1,t5_2yge0

Everything else a medium sized pot is usually good. Or if I can I start straight in the ground. Thats not always possible in a lot of climates and for a lot of things though.For soil I mix compost our local dump gives it out for free coconut coir amazon and hydroponics stores have it.

10969693,0,t3_5wn0gx,Staycation with SO ended last night because my family came back from their vacation abroad. It was amazing having  days to live with him. It made me so excited for our future...The way he would tend to the pup so I could sleep in and if I cooked hed wash the dishes his cuddles at night time having him to laugh at silly ads on tv to sit down and have meals with. I feel shitty getting back to being alone and having to deal with how my mom wants things in the house. If I could move out things would be much easier but this house hunt is coming up on  months and has been such a let down so far. Generally people are asking for .mil usd for a half acre of land with a dilapidated house that will have to be broken down before new building can start. Ugh. ,waiting_to_try,debg2um,1,t5_2yge0
10980723,0,t3_5wscya,Ive told my sister and two very very very close friends about our timeline at this point and Im sure my SO will tell his brother. Im also sure my mother has picked up on a few hints but doesnt know any kind of exact information. I may tell her once we have started but havent decided. These are also probably the only people Ill tell if I get pregnant. Everyone else can wait until after the first trimester. ,waiting_to_try,decmpei,2,t5_2yge0
10982346,0,t3_5wsith,Thats actually the first time I thought about the costs like housing and transportation and that already having to be paid by us anyway  that makes it was easier to handle! Thanks for pointing it out. Im definitely a planner but I totally understand what you mean about getting to far into the details!,waiting_to_try,dectbqe,1,t5_2yge0
10985558,0,t1_decuqdw,Yeah I think the idea is that having a kid usually forces people into a twobedroom instead of a onebedroom apartment might make them drive more or be more likely to take taxis etc. but its a marginal increase not the whole cost!  If you already live in a twobedroom house or apartment then housing shouldnt be included in the budget.I suspect most of those onenumber estimates for baby costs to be unrealistically high. Not sure why maybe it is scare tactics like you suggest. The calculators where you can itemize the costs are much more accurate in my opinion.Also I feel like the one cost that should be planned for because its so expensive is daycare and that varies so much by location that its really hard to get a handle on!,waiting_to_try,ded6f5s,2,t5_2yge0

11073418,0,t1_demtvzn,For some people it was an issue before. my understanding is as follows... I could be off So before the ACA women were charged more for insurance and sometimes the insurance did not cover birthmaternity care. My sister had this issue. As  a part time worker she did not get health insurance through work so she went to the private market. She had to get different health insurance shortly after she found out she was pregnant since her plan did not cover the visits and care for baby. So my understanding is that before the ACA you had to make sure your private insurance covered you and even if there was coverage it could potentially be financially unattainable. It was not a mandated coverage. What the ACA helped with was pooling the risk so that seeking coverage for women of child bearing age  was required so everyone offered it and this helped to make the cost of buying the insurance easier. Health insurance it a beast in itself add in the politics and its even more clouded and hectic. Anyway.. Im a little off topic. If you want to know more about the trumpcare I suggest heading over the rneutralpolitics the mods do a pretty good job at keeping the posts neutral fair and sourced. If that is what youre looking for. Nap time.  ,waiting_to_try,den5u5q,7,t5_2yge0

11122782,0,t3_5yjqut,Im obsessed with time as well...I turned  last week and I had little mini crisis because my parents are older and I want them to enjoy their grandkid when it arrives TTC begins sept !. They assure me that theyre healthy and take care of themselves of course but its something I still worry about. I was also worried because of my age to have kids and what if it takes a while to get pregnant when we start trying all that time...but Im healthy and Im starting to prep my body now with prenatal vitamins and improvements to my dietexercise. As someone with anxiety and ADD its really hard to not obsess about time but if I focus on what I can do to increase the outcome I hope for it does help me cope. Thank you for reminding us that we have to enjoy our time in the present too! It can get hardWhen we focus so much on planning.

11341229,0,t1_dfhfkv1,Thats a really sad but nice reason to want to start sooner! Out of both of us we only have  grandparent left my dads mom and shes already a great but has maybe met her ggrandkids not even a handful of times once? twice?. They belong to my  cousins who chose to live quite far away. Our monthly budget with the new house still allows us to pay off about  a month in debt between existing credit owed and my mom. Once its gone thatll go straight into savings but thats still at least a year away probably closer to  by the time we add on those things we need to pay for that I referenced in my OP. Were not by any means swimming in debt and our interest rate on it is really good . annually so its not hard to pay down and so many people always say theres never going to be a perfect time to have kids so Im of the mind that we should start sooner too. I know DHs parents also want grandkids and theyre significantly more aged than my parents are his dad is . Actually this is interesting now that Im thinking about it. DH also said he was worried about the big cost things and that was a better reason to wait to TTC but knowing that his dad is  and DH hates seeing how old his dad is and hes scared of losing him soon I should point out that if I happened to get pregnant in  months our approx timeline hell be the same age when the baby is born as his dad was when he was born. He probably wont want to wait more after that! ,waiting_to_try,dfhibin,2,t5_2yge0

We spent years dating I remained clueless to his finances but once we got married he chose to give me his finances. Holy crap what did I get myself into? He has a bit of debt around k. He also owes k on a truck that I had to cosign. Hes paying it  at a time to build his credit. I have no debt with the exception of my mortgage and about k in a high yield savings account. My k and HSA are both being contributed into to the max my company will match. I make about double what he does but I also put a lot into savings and pay our health insurance before we see it. Id like to get up to k in my savings account just because its a number Ive put in my head as comfortable.
