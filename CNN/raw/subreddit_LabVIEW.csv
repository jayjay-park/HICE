3350522,0,t1_cp9qgfi,Yeah the cost of licencing and the hardware is definitely a downside to Labview. If you are looking into some kind of home automation checkout arduino or raspberry pi. Much cheaper options. ,LabVIEW,cpa6neh,1,t5_2rk9b
3645700,0,t3_3090rr,Go through the basics again then browse through examples in the example finder. A vast majority of things you want to do can be done by cobbling together examples.,LabVIEW,cq7u56g,1,t5_2rk9b
3961017,0,t1_cr7o4cw,Yeah but make sure you have your strings set up the right way. If you sent that command as is it wouldnt work because VlA is wrong. It would either be all hex or all alphanumeric.If your endofcommand character is always going to be A you could just make a subVI that concatenates all of your strings with A hex display before sending. When you concatenate strings the way you were displaying them beforehand doesnt matter they get put together the right way.Edit like someone said below to test out some commands create string constants to send out and manipulate how they appear by right clicking and selecting slash codes or hex,LabVIEW,cr7sfh2,2,t5_2rk9b
4048081,0,t1_crgzijv,Actually FGVs are THE way to prevent race conditoins when accessing data on a global scale. They readmodifywrite in a single call and are nonreentrant so you literally cant produce a race condition using one.,LabVIEW,crhpnrv,1,t5_2rk9b

4722395,0,t1_ctonxm7,Thanks for the help! I tried the tab approach and it was still a little wonky. I ended up going with something like thisDo you think this is a decent way of going about the splash screen?

5550240,0,t3_3r54u5,Nice job learning this stuff! You will find it useful throughout your life. Regarding Mindstorms Wikipedia reports that gtThe educational version of the products is called Lego Mindstorms for Schools and comes with the ROBOLAB GUIbased programming software developed at Tufts University using the National Instruments LabVIEW as an engine.This means that the folks at Tufts used LabVIEW to develop a new and distinct programming language specific for Mindstorm kits. I recommend that you get a Mindstorm kit that includes ROBOLAB and learn to program with it. Once you have mastered ROBOLAB youll be better prepared for tackling LabVIEW. Going straight to LabVIEW will probably be less exciting because youll find it difficult to do the fun stuff that ROBOLAB will let you do. ,LabVIEW,cwl24gd,3,t5_2rk9b
5590870,0,t3_3roob8,Check out the formula evaluator on the palette. You give it a string with variables and it returns the result. Also there is a python toolkit for LabVIEW on LAVA but Ive never used it.,LabVIEW,cwq3lwz,1,t5_2rk9b
5755412,0,t1_cxabktq,Ah okay that makes sense. Whoops. Going through your red circles from left to right. Reciprocal. Get DateTime in Seconds. Array Constant with a Numeric Constant inside to make it orange right click the Numeric Constant go to Representation then select DBL. Convert from Dynamic Data youll have to go into the properties for this VI and select the last item single waveform.

6721447,0,t3_47p2hj,If this is for display purposes just right click your string indicator and choose Hex Display.Other wise youll need to convert to a decimal array and then format back to a string without losing the width of the hex numbers. Try doing it like this.,LabVIEW,d0ek0g1,3,t5_2rk9b
6798574,0,t3_48vem9,I have been going to them for years until they moved the socal one up north.  My boss had no problems letting me go because it was local.  So I would just pick the presentations that sounded interesting and meet up with other people I have met over the years.You should go to at least one just to see what its all about if you can.  NI will also put the presentations online so you can look at them later.  Some of it is a sales pitch and some of it is usually ok.,LabVIEW,d0mwso1,4,t5_2rk9b

9135177,0,t1_d89cg03,So this is interesting  and I really dont understand why it happens this way. If I use those parameters and just run the code it works fine I ran it for several minutes with no errors. If I set the same parameters and try to execute the code with a breakpoint set before the waveform graph and step through the loops I get the error in about iterations of the loop.,LabVIEW,d89y7lu,1,t5_2rk9b
9278636,0,t1_d8qy4r2,Thanks for the replyIve done a little with Property nodes but an example would be more than welcome if you kept the code. In fact Im looking at using a chart history property node  avg function to get the avg mentioned below if you have any ideas on the TDMS problem it would be appreciated. ,LabVIEW,d8s4tzy,1,t5_2rk9b
9630780,0,t3_5cxqmu,Make sure you know how to handle timing. Like how to timeout or handle an action every x seconds. Otherwise document document document as you go. That is a big part of the final score. ,LabVIEW,da06wls,2,t5_2rk9b
9637943,0,t1_da0846j,Interesting and I didnt know that but after checking I still dont think this is the problem. If I look at it in  codes it does add the  bytes like you said but that isnt interfering with anything else. My problem right now is that LabView sees this string     fKAqA    YsArgAAZAAWAas  this hex    D FB B CF C A  CFF  CFF C    B A  A ACE F CDB  FFF  Now from using python and other sources to check the hex data the strings hex actually appears to be     cdeaccbbbcfccaccbfccbfcbecacbcacacecbccbcbcbfEven if I Flatten to String and look at the  codes LabView shows    DfFBKtCFAqCAAssCFFssCFFCYsArgAAAZAACEFCDBAFFFWAwhich is still different than what I am expecting. I just dont understand what LabView is doing to the initial string,LabVIEW,da12pqc,1,t5_2rk9b

11751274,0,t1_dgrnn0b,The whole thing was a mess... We were instructed to practice for the practical using the Universitys Virtual Computer Lab which has LabVIEW. However the actual practical has a  chance youll use LabVIEW or LabVIEW. For many of us its the first time weve used LabVIEW which only complicated things.,LabVIEW,dgs1bkr,2,t5_2rk9b
