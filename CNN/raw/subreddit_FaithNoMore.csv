4128785,0,t1_crbo12s,All of those  From The Dead are my current favorites. Cone of Shame and Matador I kind of consider masterpieces from the album. For Matador especially every element of the band whether its an instrument like piano bass drums guitar vocals or aspect like its dark tone pitch changes lyrics etc. is masterfully done. Patton of course owns the transitions seamlessly going from whispers to croons similar heard in Mondo Cane which I really dont think that style has been vocally included in any FNM up until this point. LOVING the album!,FaithNoMore,crqwm6o,2,t5_2tkkk
4247086,0,t3_39ldm1,OK... while other people probably knew this this version is remastered at Abbey Road Studios nonetheless and there are no lyrics included. Instead theres a fairly decent writeup of the history of the album. I was on the fence before but now I know I have to get the deluxe version of The Real Thing.,FaithNoMore,cs4cwxo,3,t5_2tkkk
