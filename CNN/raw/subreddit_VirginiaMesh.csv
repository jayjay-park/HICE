Ive been using it for about a decade and it has a rich following with tons of active users and developers making improvements and customizations. It is definitely one of the best ways to have realtime chat with people very quickly.  If you came to a username and password screen try just using a username and no password. You should only need a password if you are registered with a nickname bot to authenticate yourself but that is not required.  Im starting to really like slack even though it is essentially the same concept as IRC with duller edges. I especially like how they handle mobile applications. cjdns is a Layer protocol for routing addressing and some other stuff. Batmanadv is a layer protocol for physical transmission of data. Check out some information about OSI layers for how these all work together  Batmanadv and cjdns work well together because batmanadv handles physical linking of wireless devices while cjdns sits on top. You can run both batmanadv and cjdns on an access point running OpenWRT.  I havent played too much with Commotion but Commotion looks to act more as an operating system or firmware based off of OpenWRT integrating its own software across several OSI layers. Commotion is designed for rapid mesh network creation so you dont have the process of exchanging peer information for connection like with cjdns. This could be desirable or undesirable. It looks like the software is expanding to run on desktopserver operating systems but support is primarily on wireless hardware meaning you have much more local networks that dont make up a greater whole like Hyperboria. Apparently you can also run cjdns in conjunction with Commotion but I have no idea how successful that is.  Byzantium is a Linux distribution meant for emergency mesh networking not necessarily for stable longrunning nodes that require a high level of security. As their tag line says it is mesh software for the zombie apocalypse. You could argue that Byzantium rivals cjdns because of their incompatible routing implementations Byzantium uses OLSR but they are doing completely different things for different purposes.   My Pis are always indoors but to clear up confusion my Pis ARE my nodes. Currently they offer no wireless connectivity but I am hoping to change that. In theory I wouldnt have a problem placing them outdoors but would need an insulated waterproof case. Id much rather use an offtheshelf access point with a case rated for outdoor use.,VirginiaMesh,d0368tm,1,t5_342or
