However there is only vs SoloQ right now because they disabled the other ladders due to low player count you still can join the MM with two of your friends you just all will get SoloRating instead of a Team one.,bloodlinechampions,coaatow,11,t5_2rwzp

3170469,0,t1_coqaqtt,Thank you Izlandi. I suspected as much about Hafu. And the fact is that Hafu has already streamed BLC and probably gave the game as much exposure as she could anyway. Her viewership are loyal Hearthstone players and shes probably worried about alienating them. I dont blame her. Its her living. The information about the other streamers is very helpful. These are people out group will definitely talk to. I think if we get a large enough group together we can make streaming BLC very attractive for some of these middling streamers.,bloodlinechampions,coqm8r9,1,t5_2rwzp
3244202,0,t3_2x4mri,Food for thought rangedhealmelee comp Some ranged lack consistent outs seekerSc mainly and this paired with a highly evasive melee teammate can spell out a disastrous trend. Seekers and Stormcallers become the goto targets when the alternative is wasting cds on a slippery harb ranid stalker or HH. tldr seeker or Sc doesnt melee pair so great Ive found tank are better sponges,bloodlinechampions,coy9pi8,2,t5_2rwzp

3405484,0,t1_cpgg5ot,I edited it so that should make it a bit a clearer. The first thing I thought of when they mentioned they would be tracking wl in tournmanets was that it would have some MMR for quals or that it would have an effect on your grade or something with a tangible reward. It doesnt though. Make it matter. Add a rating to your tourny teams WL and make the quals and brackets count towards that. If you want to see a return to games that mattered and teams playing their best thats the way to do it. Theres a lot of small intricacies that would need to be worked out but realistically I fail to see how it would be impossible for this to be a reality.,bloodlinechampions,cpgg7we,1,t5_2rwzp

8875177,0,t1_d7enf1b,My problem with it is its just a classic thing that really only effects the highest levels of players. The more newbie players wont even know what youre doing when you try to fake cast because they wont even have memorized the casting animations for each characters abilities. Seems like its more limiting to the higher levels than it would ever be abusive towards the lower ones.,bloodlinechampions,d7eo670,7,t5_2rwzp
