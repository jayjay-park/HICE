8080730,1,t1_d4nllv4,Why is it that everytime I enter the Reddit space every single user I engage attempts to twist my sincere concern and desire to help by misconstruing my words and having the audacity to think they know me based on one post. Youre God damn right when I was getting the shit beat out of me and praying I live through yet another beating I was wishing he was dead. And when I finally got the courage to leave and he continued to torment my children with his sociopathic actions  I told him I wished he was dead. And in that moment I did... I can blame my ex for every ounce of pain Im experiencing now. Its selfish people like you who either threaten to or follow through with the act of suicide that cant seem to take the blame for anything. Do you think youre the only one with a defective core? Others with similar defects work their asses off to fight for their life. Giving up is both selfish and the easy way out. You have people here tip toeing around you in attempt to not upset you further and convince you that life is a better option. Well your rudeness woke me up to that game which I was a player in  so heres the cold hard truth. Either be a selfish selfcentered person with a poorme attitude and destroy those around you with your inconsiderate actions or get on the God damn ball and get yourself some help. Theres plenty out there and new research all the time that makes the impossible possible. I will not be revisiting this post and am not a regular Reddit user. Take from it what you will and try to find some hope in your sea of despair.,suicides,d4ocl0e,3,t5_358se
