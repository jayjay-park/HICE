I think the takeaway was that there actually arent many studies showing modafinil helps people perform better  its unclear whether the modafinil works and whether its not just a placibo effect so any ethical cheating considerations cant yet be taken seriously. I dont think the uni itself had anything to do with the talk it was hosting by the Edinburgh University Neurological Society which seems to be made up of mostly medical students.  ,Edinburgh_University,dgomfpb,1,t5_2tgwd
