1108731,0,t3_26rxco,Lots of big words but they lost me at ngstrmsized homo and heterocrystals. Does everything need to be PC these days? Jesus said no homo crystals regardless of size shall be fabricated for verily thus shall be fabricated wackage.

1366129,0,t1_cinbccn,I think we should. Eventually my body is going to die and I will want a new one to upload my consciousness into. I know this isnt rtranshumanism but thats my simple justification. A less extremely transhuman example is the liberation of women from child bearing. If a woman doesnt want to carry a child but wants children or if a gay couple wants children they can combine their genetics digitally and then prints the child. Would probably be significantly cheaper in the end to do that rather than artificial wombs. ,nanotech,cinj7vd,1,t5_2qo1n
1416395,0,t1_citfe92,Thats a distinction that definitely got a little blurred for me in my efforts to read up on these things. So the tunneling microscope uses the emitter tip to feel electrons on the substance being examined at very close range while the electron microscope shoots electrons at it and measures what bounces off... correct? Are there advantages to one or the other? Seems based on my limited knowledge that the SEM would allow you to image slightly larger objects without needing a flat surface where the STM would basically need a small flat surface and youd have to position the emitter tip right up against the sample. Is there an SEM that works without a vacuum chamber?Im a science major at school chemistry and computer science so some concepts Im familiar with but others generally the stuff thats electrical engineeringrelated Im a little rusty on so this is definitely a learnwhileIwork project.,nanotech,cittnt2,1,t5_2qo1n
