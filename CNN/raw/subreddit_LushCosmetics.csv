399148,0,t1_cfm078q,lush employee here I agree with you on the lack of training for the holiday hires. As core staff we got  hour week long training and I still felt like that wasnt enough when the shop opened! As one of the Product Trainers in my store I was shocked about the lack of knowledge from the holiday hires brought in as core staff. Ive been working with returning costumers since the new year fixing those SA recommendations P If its really a big issue in your store bring it up to the manager every store should have at least one Product Trainer role. Luckily lush is very hell bent on PK and training so if enough employees demand more training we will get it. ,LushCosmetics,cfm4ycj,2,t5_2tqbr

6212447,0,t3_40mlx9,I think your water and tub faucet has a significant impact on bubble production. The five or so tubs Ive used Lush bubble bars in through the years have all behaved differently. Luckily the tub I have now shoots water out like a fire hose so I can use a fraction of what Ive had to use in other places. Downside is that you dont get nearly as much smell when you use less. Yesterday I put in  of the strawberry Christmas blob and had to turn the tub off way too soon because the bubbles made a massive mountain that overflowed the tub. Smelled nice though! With less generous tubs Ive done the trick with the old pair of stockings where you put a bit of bar in and tie it so it hangs directly under the water. Worked reasonably well. ,LushCosmetics,cyvse2s,1,t5_2tqbr

6721606,0,t3_47mh3o,Not the BFA toner in question but my Tea Tree Toner has been a literal GAME CHANGER for my face. I suffer from Rosacea and incredibly sensitive dry skin that is prone to blackheads and large pores. This toner water has helped reduce my oil production  tighten up my pores and keep my redness and irritation minimized. I actually cut this out of my routine have had it about a month and found that my Rosacea and face irritation was really bad again within the course of  hours. Started using it twice a day after cleansingapplying my medication and boom just like that back to being manageable. Total Life Saving product!,LushCosmetics,d0eklrg,1,t5_2tqbr

Its not just for makeup removal you can use it like an oil cleanse method although an oil cleanse method is way cheaper.  I used to work at a Lush years ago and thats a common misconception about Ultrabland. Its actually very gentle for all skin types.

7604157,0,t1_d36iwm5,Yes and no. I definitely think we have a lot more young girls who are in the shop due to the social media influence Zoella and the like. So it can seem overwhelmingly preteeny in the shops. But in no way has the last few releases had only sweet smells! The Fathers Day range is super smokey woody and citrusy though I know you probably havent smelled it yet. They are sophisticated I think. And things like Experimenter Needles and Pines Devils Nightcap Outback Mate Gorilla Volume  fragances etc... those are complicated smells that the young ones dont always like. Lush has always always had candy scents  Snow Fairy has been around for a while as has Think Pink MMM Rock Star and Comforter. I wouldnt say I think theres more than usual. And I wouldnt say they are exclusively bought by that age range either. If Lush was catering to the candy crowdpreteens Space Girl would not have left we would have more lip scrubs and  there would have been a sweet shower jelly to replace Sweetie Pie.Honestly the demographic has changed in terms of who is coming in the door even compared to when I started but as someone who likes those complicated scents I dont feel let down by the new ranges at all!PS Get Superdad.

At least in our store we would be delighted to have a new regular who defies the norm  it makes you memorable and we will probably chat to you more casually when we see you! Theres a guy who comes in to our store is something like a million feet tall super buff and buys a bath bomb for himself once a week. When he comes in he gets immediately greeted by name and two or three of us come over to chat to him just because we know him so well. So be open about your Lush addiction well appreciate it.

10184437,0,t3_5lia5x,I loved Movis a lot but I had to stop using it. I have acne prone skin this really helped imo. It was exfoliating and didnt dry my skin out. The reason I stopped using it was just because I was having a really bad breakout and the bar actually hurt to rub over it. I cant get it to foam up at all in my hands so the only viable option was to rub it on my face but that wasnt happening when it was in that condition. Ive since moved on and stopped using foaming cleansers but I keep my old Movis around for chest and back. ,LushCosmetics,dbygnhu,1,t5_2tqbr

They are crazy expensive for something you use once. Stick to the bubble bars for your baths. You can really stretch those by crumbling up a small amount in the tub before you run the water and then just swish the water up to dissolve the crumbles as it is running. It my experience you really dont need that much if you do it this way. Comforter and Brightside bars give you the most bubbles baths for your money. You could get  nice baths per bar. Also a word on the soaps. They are known to dissolve fast but you can stretch them if you cut them up into smaller pieces to use instead of the whole bar.You might still have luck if you want to get in on some of the boxing day deals on the US site. They are doing periodic restocks and people post immediately to the boxing day threads when they happen.  ,LushCosmetics,dc0saxc,5,t5_2tqbr

10280958,0,t3_5n7e0x,Ditto what everyone else said about finding products that are best for you.  One persons routine might end up another persons nightmare particulary for skincare.  Saying that heres mine Morning Bath usually with either a bit of bubble bar or bath bomb I break both of these up.  Clean with a shower gel or jelly.  My favourite scents are Rose Jam and Bubbly so often something of that flavour. Follow up with a body lotion or a body conditioner used like a lotion when my skin is wet.  Touch of perfume if Im in the mood.  If Im in a hurry itll just be a shower with shower gel or jelly followed by lotion. Morning Face At the moment either Buche de Noel or Let the Good Times Roll cleansers.  I also really like aqua marina.  Then Eau Roma Water followed by Celestial I think Im going to switch to Vanishing Cream when my pot is finished.  Grease Lightning on spots.  A bit of makeup including Feeling Younger highlighter and Emotional Brilliance face powder. Evening Face Take off my makeup with  and a flannel.  Eau Roma Water to help get the rest off and celestial again but Im going to get some Full of Grace for nighttime. Hair I only wash mine  times a week because the ends tend to stay dry and only my scalp gets greasy.  Use a bit of No Drought to keep fresh on non washing days.  I have a couple of shampoo bars Brazilliant and Jason and the Argon Oil but sometimes I use a shower jelly or fun for washing my hair.

A little goes such a long way its super easy to tell where you have missed a spot and leaves your skin super smooth and hydrated! As for dream cream the sp version is much more thick than the regular version and I find it to be more moisturizing and it seems to soak into my skin better than the original. Massage bars are great as well after shaves if you have the time to let them really soak in and a lot of people on here rave about sympathy for the skin. But try shaving with fun then next time.

They have no idea if shes contacted her vet about using the products or even if she full on bathed the dogs in the bath or just wanted an Instagram picture. I really just dont want to see a repeat of the post from last week where several people attacked someone with only one source of information.

The product doesnt have any preservative added to it to help elongate the shelf life and by adding water you create the opportunity for bacteria to grow.

Consistency was also like soft whipped cream.Strawberry Feels ForeverUK got one recently and it is a nice strawberry milkshakewhite chocolate scentNA got one a few years ago and it was so sweet I couldnt use it and I really like sweet scents.Angels on Bare SkinUK just smells a lot more lavender than the NA but this might be a batch thing or seasonal thing because of the actual lavender in it.I got a Fresh Farmacy sample from the UK recently and I am loving it but when I tried Fresh Farmacy from the NA my skin didnt like it... granted it was a few years ago also but the bar is also a lot softer from the UK. idk if it has to with with where they source the ingredients or what.My bath bombs from UK always arrive in better condition from the UK look a little bit bigger but that might be because they dont arrive battered and smell more fragrant.

11655377,0,t3_66b3bx,DPD are absolute trash for this kind of thing. It actually makes my heart sink when I see I have deliveries being handled by them. All I can suggest is that you keep on and on at them exhausting as it can be. Theyve done this sort of thing to me before claiming my parcel was lost and after a couple of days of being constantly on at them sorry person at customer services who had to deal with me but if your driver wasnt such an asshole this wouldnt be happening! my parcel magically arrived just on the doorstep of my place of work I figure he was a little scared to bring it into me . It was probably in the back of his van in a corner somewhere and rather than bother to look and resolve it within  minutes he just denied all knowledge of it for days and then tadah! It somehow was unlost and showed up again! Fingers crossed your goodies turn up soon. Down with DPD theyre rubbish. ,LushCosmetics,dgh5gs2,5,t5_2tqbr

11726167,0,t3_67bihx,Along with them being all handmade they all have different amounts of oils in themfor example the bubbleroon JasonArgan Oil and Pearl massage bar have the most rose absolute making them more of a hard hitting floral scent. The body conditioner and shower gel have cypress and vanilla which gives a muskier and earthier scent. Rose Bombshell although in the scent family is distinctly more citrusy due to it having the most lemon oil of all of the other Rose Jam scents so that could definitely be why its not as Rose Jamy to you!Rose Jam is one of my favorite scents but I absolutely prefer the earthiness of the original to all of the other Rose Jam products. TLDR if you like Ros Argan youll love Rose Jam shower gel because they have almost exactly the same scent!,LushCosmetics,dgp6wj7,4,t5_2tqbr

11735761,0,t3_67drat,I have tried Rosy Cheeks and did not like that way my skin felt afterwards.  Look at the masks that have exfoliation with them as that is going to help polish away dead skin and help brighten you skin.  I personally love Love Lettuce for that. If you are willing to branch away from the FFM Mask of Mag is my holy grail for all skin issues and its going to have that exfoliation youre looking for as well.  ,LushCosmetics,dgqa0x1,2,t5_2tqbr
