10522138,0,t1_dd0kwgm,Yep I was talking about zm. An alternative to zm. This is still within acceptable boundaries of discussion. knnniggett actually told me to post on zm forum.Seriously though. Did zm devs make an account for this post or something? It was made prior to its single post and its here to try and defend zoneminder. That is unacceptable behaviour guys. At least post on your own account like I did. Instead of trying to convince users here zm is without problems  just work on zoneminder so you dont have to convince anyone of anything.Lets pretend you are a genuine person  why are you here then? Why should it matter what I think? If you think a suggestion is spam then you would have continued to ignore it there is no need to respond to my post or check out Shinobi. As you said zm works fine for you meaning you came here with the specific intent to exchange words about zoneminder. not only that making a new account for the purpose. Why? If zm is as you say it doesnt need any defending not a word.You didnt even criticize my platforms features why not? Nothing to say about it? Something smells fishy. Nice try guys that is a new level of low. I just wanna say Im  and I know this behaviour is wrong. Its worse than actually being a spammer.Technically speaking your post is spam it is unsolicited and an advertisement for zoneminder based on the standards the zm forum is going by... Ill leave the post and let people see what you just tried to do. If you want to post on this subreddit use your main account like i did on the zm subreddit.,ShinobiCCTV,dd0sqkv,1,t5_3i00f

Load the list of ONVIF configured cameras. Register the ZM server as a motion notification callback location this is refreshed every  minutes. Create a SOAP HTTP POST probably event listener that is called by the camera when a motion event is triggered.Maybe Ill see if I can figure out a proof of concept in node.js that I can share.,ShinobiCCTV,dfra88x,2,t5_3i00f
