654479,0,t1_cgensgj,Yes Im aware birds are good at hiding injuries kind of survival to not seem injured so you dont seem like easy prey.Im thinking this may have been a cat attack as we have quite a few cats wandering around here.I am more concerned about blood loss at this point though. It has already shed a few drops of blood in my hand and though that might not seem like a lot for a cut finger or something its quite a bit more for something that only weighs a few ounces.,bird,cgenx1k,1,t5_2t5rh
902220,0,t1_ch6tzhd,Yeah. Thanks for the guilt trip buddy. All I know is that I perched his head so like his head would face the inside of the bowl so that he could drink easier. Came down to him dead flat on his back. I moved him around his neck was weak too flexible. And blood was coming out from his face I think. ,bird,ch6u5lw,1,t5_2t5rh
1161857,0,t1_ci0bpwx,Yeah from day one it was like he couldnt understand why we didnt immediately just let him do whatever he wanted. I live here now. Eventually he just got his way. He lives in a giant flight cage in my living room and we attend to his every need like a little prince. We even gave him a chance to be free but he just walked back into the kitchen and we put him back in the cage. We dont even close the cage door now. He just has no interest in leaving. Fat lazy little bastard. ,bird,ci0bt24,2,t5_2t5rh

2414709,0,t1_cma5wbv,Good to hear! Enjoy one of the wonders of nature.  PS. I agree with you that its a common blackbird. Amazing how similar it looks in shape and size to its relative the American Robin despite having entirely different colors! ,bird,cma60n7,2,t5_2t5rh

8068846,0,t3_4ppm78,Not a hundred percent sure on species maybe some type of flycatcher? Not really sure. Best option is reuniting them with their mother. When baby birds get to a certain age they will spend time on the ground. The parents hang out and watch from a far and continue to come and feed them. This is normal for baby birds If there is a safe place to put them back near where they were in a shrub or a low branch that is best. If it has been over  hours the parents have probably given up and moved on. Or if there are any puncture wounds at all from the cat or they seem lethargic or injured in some way and even if not you need to get them to a wildlife rehabilitator if you want them to have a chance back in the wild. The amount of care and specialized diet they will need to develop properly is generally much more than most people can provide. Also it is very easy to pass food and liquids into birds lungs when you are trying to feed them and this will cause them to aspirate and possibly die if you are not trained to do so. You can Google where your nearest wildlife rehabilitator is. ,bird,d4n0j7n,1,t5_2t5rh
8081416,0,t1_d4oeuxo,It was under my grandmas porch very far away from any nesting spots and in a cat heavy area I have it in a wire cage right now bundled in a towel with a ceramic heating bulb around . feet away from it.,bird,d4ofclo,1,t5_2t5rh

11666482,0,t3_66g6in,Been there done that! You have to make a fake Mommy bird out of paper or whatever works then color it accordingly should look like an adult Swallow. The chick will then accept food from the surrogate parent. If the chick seems like its full feathered take it outside and let it see the other swallows. When we did that it chirped a few times then took off to join the others. Best of luck!,bird,dgiesxm,1,t5_2t5rh
