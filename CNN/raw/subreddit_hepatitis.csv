1564183,0,t3_2aj33y,Mid week   Sleeping still sucks though the Ambien my doctor gave me seems to knock me out for a good  hours before I wake up. Bit of headache today but still not too bad. Mostly just tired. Tired forever. And Im in the South where the weather seems determined to leech all of my energy in order to increase heat and humidity.I am looking forward to the weekend so I can try to get a good  hours of sleep even if it involves small bursts.This update is reminding me I wanted to post yall some links about the combo pill coming out in October that people seem to be excited about. Hoping by typing this out Ill remember to do so later!Did some bloodwork Monday. I was disappointed to see it was only a metabolic panel and CBC  though it would be early for a viral load I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to see how its going!! Appointment late next week to follow up on the bloodwork  I may try to complain to change to Ambien CR.,hepatitis,cjccd2t,1,t5_2xe3d
