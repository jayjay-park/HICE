3709623,0,t1_cqesmmu,I think BO had the best gameplay in the campaigns but one of the worst stories and that really holds it back for me. Now I havent played it in  years now so I cant remember every single flaw but Ill explain why below. Keep in mind I completely respect your opinion and am only doing doing this for enlightened discussion purposes. Ill start off light and into personal pet peeves then progress into things that are more seriously kind of messed up imo. At the basic end BO was a bit of an issue for me because of the disconnect from BO one of the best stories imo. Hudson wasnt the same character at all in more than just voice making completely decisions and having entirely different mannerisms than he did in BO.  The Woods stuff was all sorts of screwed. They still never really explain how he made it. You start off the game with rescue Woods thinking itll be from Hanoi in BO from the intel. Nope completely different capturing and unrelated rescuing. Then they vaguely explain the BO capturing but completely randomly and way out of left field. Its just a mess The big china cold war that was the driving point of their marketing off the start had like a single line in the game. I knew more about it from the marketing. Now this doesnt necessarily deter from the game but leads into another point about things not being as fleshed out as they should have been. Everything sort of felt flat.  Woods attitude toward Hudson annoyed me. Here we have Hudson the guy who quite literally was most responsible for saving the world back in . How does Woods react? By throwing a grenade at him and then blaming him for everything going wrong. Congrats Woods youre literally the reason everything went bad throwing a grenade at Hudson and Menendezs sister and somehow pegged it on the guy you threw said grenade at. Now it would be one thing if the game actually provided a counteracting point explaining this like a good script would but instead the casual audience that doesnt pay attention just thinks Woods is so awesome and cool and Hudson is some screw up. Oh and not to mention Hudson put together the OP to save Woods yet Woods somehow still hates him. Just annoys me.  Continued from above why didnt Woods just walk out and shoot Menendez in the face? There was a billion easier ways of doing that throwing a grenade at your squad. Just a forced mechanic to get the sister to die.  Why was old man Kravchenko a high ranking guy leading the charge in a tank? How is he still alive? Just what   Menendezs plan is to get captured taken to a specific aircraft carrier break out manage to go through the whole ship without getting capped and use this one specific thing to control everything?  Thats not far fetched at all.  Its the Hey lets do that cool thing in every movie these days where the bad guy gets caught but HE WANTS to be caught that will be really shocking... Menendez has escaped like  times. Why are you not just blowing his head off? Not to mention you have an undercover agent as like his right hand man which would take years of work but can never find him.  INSANELY easy to kill him.Theres more stuff I cant remember but the story bothers me to the point I just have trouble defending the campaign. Again gameplay wise it was phenomenal but the story was just a giant mess imo. Feel free to reply and provide counter arguments ,blackops3,cqf4fdk,1,t5_2tl1c

Remember how absurd the FMGs were the first few months? The Striker?MW was a way better game than Ghosts but they didnt give the vocal community what was asked for either time they catered to brand new players just like they always do.Nobody wanted every map to on Ghosts to be the size of Fuel with  perks to choose from.

3733780,0,t1_cqhuv95,Yes but moving to modern warfare was alright because it wasnt anything out of the ordinary players were still playing on a D world FPS where you could still only run around on mostly horizontal lanes and jump only a few feet high and access a couple of buildings on foot. Same thing with Black Ops  it only gave the game a fresh feel to it only thing that really changed from time frame to time frame were guns and little things such as the way streaks were used etc...

3758043,0,t1_cqkk9z5,Agree . I was fairly good at previous CoDs not because I had a fancy Scuf highend connection or only used the dominant weapons but because I had good map awareness predicting where enemies would come from and getting into gunfights in the best position and getting first shot. AW though makes predicting enemies too random sure you might have a general idea where enemies might be on CTFUplinkSearchDom but good luck on TDMKC... but its impossible to predict whether theyll be coming at you by foot boost dodging doublejumping or doublejumping plus boosting. And unless youre using a silenced weapon its really hard to win a gunfight and get away before someone else boosts towards you and shoots you from behind or finishes you off when youre already damaged with no time to heal.There used to be a middle role between extreme camper and always runandgun playstyles moving from cover to cover holding spots for a few seconds depending on enemy positions and taking time to flank when possible. The great part about that playstyle was that it worked fine with LMGs or less OP weapons. You made up for weapon weaknesses with tactics. AW really hurts that role either you sit in weird lowtraffic areas and camp or just run and spray with a BALASM. Anything in between isnt very effective.,blackops3,cqkn7ee,5,t5_2tl1c

Biggest problem with AW was no classic support whatsoever a few ladders doesnt mean it can be played classically as well. The maps were built only for Exos.

Will you still be constantly melted all the time when you try to strafe your way through a gunfight?I cant even stand Advanced Warfare anymore. My ping is constantly crap the lag compensation is garbage and the shitty spawns make the game even more frustrating.

They can say it all they want but when making the game they had to make sure their ideas could be ported back to last gen.What people dont seem understand is design and manufacturing are  different things. You can design stuff that cant be built yet only cause you can also develop new ways to build it. The problem is they cant and arent manufacturing a new last gen console to work for the design so they have to keep the design within the scope of what is possible with the old tech.Now when they have an idea to do something they have keep in mind that this idea has to still be made on old tech. This is the problem.

COD Ghosts had  sniper nerfs Aim Down time slowered Toughness and quickdraw perks do not work if you use a sniper. Bolt reload speed increased Cross hair removed  Reload cancel removed from snipers only. Silencer in snipers was made useless. Aim assist was disabled.COD AW snipers were nerfed from DAY   viable snipers  Atlas mm Hip fire removed Aim assist removed   caliber sniper was a  shot weapon while you could punch in one hit kill. Bullet not shooting where the scope was targeting. Variable scope had aim down time increased. Barely any attachments in snipers. Random zoom in points in snipers  Increased idle sway  by the time I am lining up my shot I am dead because SMGs and ARs can easily take out people in long range.If you have not realized this.. you are ignorant. all the snipers who like to snipe went back to play BO switched to powerful Assault rifles because its punishing to use a sniper and then all you complain that the lobby is full of tryhards well snipers when they pick up a reg gun would play way better because they know where the gun would aim instead of aiming first and then targeting your opponent.people who complain that quickscoping is over powered they dont understand the sniping mechanics quickscoping is jut sniping with a very high  Max sensitivity and when you line up your shot the moment you see your target in your scope you take a shot if a sniper misses his first shot he is dead.snipers have to practice with that insane high sensitivity because they have to be viable during any situation and can snap to a target because of high sensitivity that landing  shot in that high sensitivity take time and practice.  ,blackops3,csduuol,5,t5_2tl1c

4376990,0,t3_3b5cbd,So I agree with you and disagree with you on some things that you said. I agree snipers should not have aimassist because that mechanic is slightly broken in a weapon which has a HK potential. However I disagree that snipers need further drawbacks because most snipers already have one major drawback and that is the fact that if you miss your first shot you are very likely going to die. This is more applicable to boltaction sniper rifles but in general snipers are not spammable to the extent that fullyautos are. Many players feel that sniper rifles have no downsides but I think thats a bit of an exaggeration. They are lethal in the right hands but the removal of autoaim should make them balanced enough with the movement system we will be having. No need to completely nuke them. ,blackops3,csj0tka,5,t5_2tl1c
4381553,0,t1_csjhgve,I personally thought the Afterlife mechanic was a huge part of what made Mob of the Dead great.

But it did have a few flaws that they should fix. The worst for me was dying because of a horde around me right after reviving myself.

4398042,0,t3_3beda9,For me its mainly due to variety. I enjoy playing tough games that come down to the wire where it feels as though Im evenly matched or maybe even playing some people that are legitimately better than me but not every game. Same thing goes with those easy games where I have a chance of earning a DNA bomb. I really enjoy myself in these games and it really gets my adrenaline going even though Im fully aware of the fact that the people Im playing against arent even close to the same level as me. Again I wouldnt want this to be every game.I feel this contrast is one of the key factors in increasing the longevity of a title. Sometimes you have to fight hard other times you get a chance to do something insane like drop a DNA bomb or even simply work on a challenge for a gun that cant possibly be used effectively against a similar skilled team using BALs and ASMs. In AW for me it seems in  of my games I have to fight as hard as possible while being limited to a few guns if I want to win and  of the time I get to relax a bit and use something strange or go for some sort of an odddifficult challenge.If I want a challenge every game Ill gladly go and play ranked.,blackops3,csle731,41,t5_2tl1c

4912765,0,t1_cudsarz,Yea I certainly agree the more players there are and the larger the data set seems like it would be better from a developer point of view. However there are other considerations that impact the decision. Its not a black and white decision that the only logical choice is to extend the beta because otherwise they would extend the beta indefinitely and Im not saying you are taking this stance.My guess is they were looking for specific things with the beta and also had some stretch goals if they thought they could handle them. They may have hit their main goals and extended the beta a day to hit the stretch goals. I would be willing to bet that while the player feedback was a big part of the beta it wasnt their main goal.,blackops3,cudsgvs,2,t5_2tl1c

4965275,0,t3_3hho9e,Heres all my feedback Ive compiled in one big list sorry if its too much.Stock attachment needs tuning  its barely noticeable on any guns.Sound of Silencers should sound more like BOBO Silencers.Cold Blooded should disable the little red lights on the back of your soldier.Annihilator is a bit hard to use maybe just for me  needs more aimassist?Pistols are awesome! Love how theyre very viable like in BO.EMP tactical throw distance should be increased a bit.This is just how I feel about Rejack  when you Rejack you should keep your score streak progress.Rolling Thunder needs a deadlier blast radius and it should arrive on the map quicker.Cerebus is fantastic in manual mode!When getting any type of score while Combat Focus is active that bonus score should count towards your XP progression for ranking up!Please show player count numbers for online game modes.Bullet Penetration for shooting through walls should be lessened without FMJ. It should be increased with FMJ thus making FMJ a more viable option.Add a little color like red blue greenetc to the hitmarker when getting a headshot while using High Caliber.Vesper SMG needs more love  it just doesnt compare as well to other SMGs. Too much recoil not enough damage.Haymaker  Shotgun needs more umph to it... its very unreliable. Could use a damage and range increase?IDEA When only using your Fists you should be able to hold down R and charge your punch to do more damage. Im not talking about a lunge but if youre in melee range you could hit someone if you charge enough.Treyarch please if you can find a way to let us apply the custom camo we created for a gun and let us apply it to a different gun so we dont have to make completely make camos for every gun.Please most importantly let us share our custom camos so others can download it from some kind of community or fileshare tab!Lightning Strike is VERY underwhelming compared to the Hellstorm which is actually less score to get. Maybe make the blast radius of the missile strikes more wider and deadlier.In Gunsmith let us be able to change the iron sights of our guns! Oh how splendid!In Theater Mode let us share our edited videosclips to friends YouTube Facebook Twitter etc.In Arena Mode stats for things like the Scorestreaks Used Kills With Weapons and Challenges should be updated onto your Combat Record like they would in a Public Game. In BO League Play stats Weapon Kills you earned didnt show up on Combat Record.Safeguard Game Mode is incredibly fun! I love it! I really hope its in the game on launch day.HCXD should travel a bit faster. Maybe its just me but it feels kinda slow.Dart needs control tuning. Its hard to control. Also the sensitivity for changing direction feels slow.R.A.P.S. may be too powerful?G.I. Unit for what its worth   score it should be way more powerful. It should be doing crazy stuff like shooting heavyhitting rockets if anyone comes near it or precisely taking out fastmoving targets in like midrange.Lastly please bring back the Galil or Commando from Black Ops ! It could be in future DLC. Those were my favorite guns in my favorite CoD!Thanks for reading all of my feedback Vonderhaar.,blackops3,cuketqo,1,t5_2tl1c

5210611,0,t1_cve0ilr,I dont feel bad either. They arent owed a new console so I dont feel bad in that sense. If youre still on PS or XB as your main console then you certainly are okay with playing lesser versions. I only meant in the sense of they are still charging them for a product like this.Youre looking at it from a they deserve what they get for not upgrading point of view. Im looking at it as we are all gamers and COD players so its sort of lousy they still will take the money from the last gen folks.Just because it may not affect us on current gen doesnt mean its okay. Because I guarantee you the minute Activision pushes some new microdlc some of us will be complaining about them nickle and diming us. This is no different  I just dont get in general why this elitist type of attitude came about. A PSXB doesnt really cost enough for most folks to bank their bank...It also doesnt cost enough to feel like Im riding in a Mercedes Benz and last gen people are in a  Ford Focus. Not saying you personally really but its a weird stance for current gen people to take when console probably hurts PC more than last gen affects current gen. Its still Activision so its not like without last gen wed get big  v  modes dedicated servers  more guns  more launch maps etc. ,blackops3,cve2ksf,1,t5_2tl1c

It wont matter for most players but Im a gigantic nitpick when it comes to controllers so it bothers me. Neither controller has buttons at the end of the suppression like the Gamecube so theyre both sad to me though the Gamecubes trigger springs werent that great.Edit apparently people here really dont like it when you mildly criticize their favorite controller or something,blackops3,cw1yu2n,0,t5_2tl1c

Ive been watching lots of AW because Im a kid in a candy store right now waiting for BO and I was very afraid that BO was going to be as movement insane as AW.However after watching quite a bit of the beta I can safely say that you are not a stunt plane in BO. Sure you can boost around but youre not going to be doing flips n shits. The boosting is rather slow and mostly just for jumping on roofs as opposed to stun dodging all over the place and bunny hopping constantly.Specialists abilities looked annoying to deal with but everyone is going to have one and perhaps theres modes where there wont be any.

5516200,0,t1_cwgo1qh,But if I spend that  towards a new console I wont have the  to buy the current gen version. DSeriously though for some people spending  is a lot more justifiable than spending over  for a new console and the game. There was a time there where every cent was going to the necessities and saving up any money for frivolities wasnt a reality in my life. For the sake of debate lets say you sock back  a month thats ten months right there. By the time youve saved up enough to get it Ghosts  will be set to preorder. Youve missed most of the lifecycle versus just waiting a little over a month to be able to play a game while its relevant albeit on a last gen console. Now before you say Get a better job! lets not forget the economy is still pretty shitty and many arent in a position to just quit their job and find a better one. Most people have a death grip on the ones they have which doesnt allow for a lot of upward movement sometimes. Once again the reality that spending  is far more financially possible than  comes into play here. Hell I can completely relate to some people having to buy the game used versus new to further save some money.Being the owner of both last and current gen systems affords me the choice that many simply dont have. Hearing that mob cry of Just buy the current system! really makes me feel like some people really dont know or dont remember what its like to have to make a choice between a necessity and a comfort. Some people just dont have the same options as others.,blackops3,cwgqtb5,0,t5_2tl1c

Its mainly going to be the same stuff that AW got flack for about the futuristic scene and the thrust movement even though its improved  and the newly added randomness of getting killed by a specialist and their weapon. But I do feel like a lot of people will be a little more sympathetic towards it because its a treyarch title and Ghosts and AW werent that great to begin with. ,blackops3,cwk7k2k,1,t5_2tl1c

5567553,0,t3_3rdxfz,NAT Type is referring to how the console is connected to the internet..Open  Direct connection to wired modem no router being used therefore your internal network is not being NATed. Moderate  Connection to router then to modem. With the router in the middle your internet network is being NATed. Strict  Connection to daisy chained routers where port translation become a problem. Dual NATed or heavily firewalled. The best is Open but moderate is typical for most home users that have connect multiple devices to their internet. If you have moderate you do not have a problem so dont try and fix it unless you are wiring your console directly to the modem. Strict is the one that you would have to worry. If you get strict you want to adjust firewall settings andor make sure you are not connecting behind multiple routers where the network translation can get confused.

Well average ms or so ping while PC average mscorrect me if Im wrong but thats from personal experience. Yes and no platform does matter because the server configs are different but no it doesnt because all three major platforms and poor oldgen consoles do get connection issues. Its not where if youre lagging PS is lagging but we all experience what youre saying. I honestly believe its a location and population issue. I live in ChicagoILUSA and A LOT of people play CoD in Chicago so connection here is really good.And its running on a hybrid system. Dedi and PP.

5645035,0,t3_3seyso,Gradient makes one color fade into a second chosen color.Blend causes the layer to be painted to the weapon as opposed to being a sticker and overlaying the camo.  For instance if I take a black square and scale it to cover the paintshop allocated areas it will block any camo from showing through.  If I take that same square and blend it it will look like parkerized metal parkerizing is that standard matte black finish you see on the majority of military firearms as well as numerous civilian firearms.One thing to note about blending layers certain camos will make that layer invisible altogether  or it will cause that layer to make the camo under it more vibrant.  Examples would be that Gold camo causes the layer to be invisible while the layer makes the target area more vibrant on Chameleon.  Not all camo choices are affected in this manner.Outline and Flip do exactly what you think they do.Material allows you to use stuff like carbon fiber gold and silver as opposed to traditional flat colors.   These materials have their own textures some of which are difficult to see.Fixed scale increases or decreases a layer equally while free scale allows you to stretch it further in the emblems default X and Y axes.Rotation does what you think it does.If youd like to see some examples of the blending and gradients youre welcome to add me on PSN and Ill show you my paintjobs and even modify a few to show you some stuff.,blackops3,cwwtki8,1,t5_2tl1c

5678268,0,t3_3swbx3,First I used Drakon but lately Ive been using Locus. Havent unlocked the last one yet. I use the standard scope with ballistic CPU and fast mags. Perks are Flak Jacket Fast Hands and Awareness. I struggled some in the beginning also but then I really analyzed my game whats wrong. Most kills I get are just on  quickscoping or listening when enemy runs past me and shooting them from behind. You really need to avoid mid routes on most of maps and stay on the edge of maps. I often choose a zone or a lane to protect from map. Its important to check your  minimap and to use your ears. When the spawns swap you should find a defensive position where you can wait enemies to rush into your crosshair. Usually there are just  main lanes where people will rush. Use trip mines to protect your back. When you are outnumbered in a gunfight throw a stun or two to get into a better position. Flinch is so damn annoying in the game becuse almost everytime your opponent fires first you are dead. If surviving is the problem maybe you should pick different specialist ability which helps you to stay alive longer. If you feel like you get shot when you are running SLOW DOWN. I did that and it helped me.,blackops3,cx0y1ci,1,t5_2tl1c

5681043,0,t1_cx19vt9,If this were halo or other games with high TTKs Id understand the idea of shotguns having no place but in a game where full auto weapons have TTKs of around ms how much faster at killing is a shotgun really?They have are little more forgiving in terms of aim but are much less forgiving in terms of having to use effective movement strategy. And currently most of them have such low damage andor HK capabilities that the game punishes you for using a shotgun much more than it rewards you.But the whole shotguns dont belong in CoD attitude just proves how ridiculous the standards of ARSMG players are when it comes to other weapon classes. Look at how much they are overreacting about LMGs when the most OP LMG doesnt even statistically seem to be doing much better than the average. Yet they are saying that all LMGs are OP. Theres a reason in spite all the whining about LMGs all supposedly being OP that Treyarch BUFFED one of the LMGs just like how in spite of all the people whining about shotguns in this game they BUFFED the KRM and Argus.,blackops3,cx1afdu,1,t5_2tl1c

5686629,0,t3_3t0g7a,. The cool thing about this years CoD is that you can pretty much make every weapon work. If you are looking for the most competetive though the VMP is still top tier same as the Pharo and the Vesper. None of the attachments is too strong you just have to try out what works best for you. I just have to tell you that the silencer has a huge penality this year according to Driftrs indepth video and I feel the same when Im using it.. Well pretty much answered that question already . Yes leveling takes a lot of time in general. Ive entered first prestige a few days ago and it felt like I rank up a lot quicker now. If you are an objective player its probably the best to play one of the objective modes thats the most fun for you. Anyway Im playing ffa and ranking up crazy fast at the moment because I win pretty much every round with about k points and the games are just so short.. Prestiging is pretty simple this year. You keep EVERYTHING just your level is resetted which means you will have to rank up before you can use certain weapons  specialists again but once you unlock them your progress camos and attachments are still there and you can instantly use them again and continue your progress. You get one permanent unlock every prestige which will allow you to unlock an item at lvl  throughout every prestige.,blackops3,cx1zccr,2,t5_2tl1c

5718335,0,t3_3tggcr,You always see this to some extent in COD but I have never seen it as bad as it has been in BO . Someone has to capture the objectives or you dont win. Everyone wants to rack up kills and call in score streaks maybe complete a couple of their challenges. For as long as Ive been playing Dom this is done after everyone caps their home flag and tries to cap B. Then we control the map. If that means pushing to the enemy flag to draw them out at least everyone knows the spawns are about to flip. In BO  Ive seen people sprint straight for the enemy flag to set up spawn traps. Didnt even stop long enough to cap their home flag. Im even good with a player that isnt helping cap B but providing cover for those that do. But if youre heading straight out to get your  SPM with no regard for the objectives at all youre not playing Dom. And without someone capping and holding the objectives your  kills per game make you first place on the losing team.,blackops3,cx5wyyd,2,t5_2tl1c

Not this just barely shorter than your character bullshit. Or they could lower the camera so its actually at eye level and make it so your weapon doesnt magically shoot through objects unimpeded.  Its been in the game for forever. And everyone has voiced complaints for just as long.

Another example would be random head shots now some times it will benift you but with an attachment like high cailber in the game its almost ridiculous what flinch can do. Granted it dosnt happen often but it happens to me a good amount where you shoot some one they shoot back there gun flinches up melts you from a high cailber head shot. Im not necessarily a bad player either so Im not just companing cuz Im bad I just dont see the need for flinch in a game that gunfights are so heavily determined by lag comp so why add another unnecessary factorEDIT I also feel some guns have more flinch than others like man o war also sometimes flinch is fine and other times its controllable Im assuming lag has a factor into thatAlso if you think Im just companing cuz I suck my stats are . kd  spm,blackops3,cxa5d61,1,t5_2tl1c

RAPS is just not aggressive enough they seem to drop down where the player is when the other team is on the other sode of the map and they kinda just roll around doing nothing until they lock on and then they go nuts. Then they do nothing again and then go away.. Yay exiting hellstorm needs to be able to actually hit and kill what its locked onto if not why bother giving false hope that then leads to disappointment and lightningstrike.. Why does it let the other team know you are choosing where to drop the bombs.. And then it lets them know its coming in with a long pause followed by pauses between the bombs.. Nothinng about this works in the slightest if you get a kill with this consider it luck..Rolling thinder should come in a tad faster is all. Curreently imo dart talon and turret are the best streaks overall that are not overcosted and worth more than their value.,blackops3,cxdpn0r,1,t5_2tl1c

5815893,0,t1_cxhzjld,but for the fact that in my experience less then  of the people who cut in front of you actually come and kill you back because if its a decent player they know they did wrong by crossing your fire and when its a bad player they may not even realize it was not the other player shooting him.The ones who come back are normally the ones that get shot as they come around a corner and their name did not pup up to know they were friendly but they saw your name and got mad.At the end of the day if you quickly had a kill before right after or both they should know it was not a purposeful team kill and take it up to playing in HC.  If they cant except they may be killed by a teammate now and then not talking blatend walk up and meleeshoot you team kills they should stick to core...

5838476,0,t1_cxkr6zh,gt But regardless of that KD means virtually nothing. WL is more important than KD. I could get a great KD in a lot of game modes but contribute absolutely nothing to my team. Another point would be like I said players could have a . KD because he likes to mess around in pubs but could be winning tournaments on tournaments.Which is exactly why the system should be changed.  In its current form a player who plays for the win and completes objectives is going to be punished with a KD that becomes nigh impossible to raise after several thousand games.  Players who DO care about KD will just camp or ignore objectives to whore out their KD due to the strict penalties that come with a neutralnegative KDChanging it to only count past  games means players wont receive nearpermanent consequences for playing objectives and KD whores wont need to pad their stats since they can just grind out high ratio gameplays whenever they feel like it without being locked into a playstyle in order to keep their stats up.  An objective player can take a break from flag capping and hop into a DM mode or take up the role of a slayer and watch their KD stat grow over time as they improve.  Likewise a KD minded player can take a break from passive play and rush around with goofy weapons and not have to worry about their KD nearpermanently dropping.  ,blackops3,cxky95q,8,t5_2tl1c

Check out driftrs video on grip and on some of the weapons you cant even tell you are using grip at all.  Some recoil patterns actually look worse with the grip attached.

The fact that there arent people bouncing all over the map sniping while flying through the air is one of the things that makes this game better than AW.  I loved the Mors but you basically couldnt miss and killed in one shot ... an insult to the idea of sniping.   ,blackops3,cxu6obc,1,t5_2tl1c

But once you fire the camo turns off. Perhaps Active Camo on Domination. Beginning of the second half bypass home point throw C on B pop Active Camo detonate when enemies are on the point? Might work.Heat Wave would be good in the same way.

Can you actually name what balanced out the M because it wasnt the recoil wasnt the sway there was none wasnt the damage and wasnt the fire rate. And no the very small burst delay doesnt do much when the gun is likely to  burst at nearly any range.They were usable but not great on maps with mostly close range and were unusable in other maps. Thats not the makings of a great gun thats the makings of a useless gun.Bullshit the MiniUzi had next to no recoil. That was the P. And what are talking about it not needing much ammo to kill with? It was a low damage SMG.Last Stand isnt obvious.

Teammates cant go for B because they cant win gunfights. Teammates cant hold AC because they get slaughtered in spawn. If it is a a v there is NOT MUCH ONE CAN DO.And before you say something stupid again like you didnt have any captures on AC ill bring up the point again that  people are already capping AC and having one more person capping it to raise their stats is pointless when they could be elsewhere.,blackops3,cy3v1ko,1,t5_2tl1c

5986746,0,t3_3xgcvt,In most other games that are popular and PVP based there are two matchmaking game types. There is casual for when you just want to play the fucking game and maybe use some interesting or dumb gun. Then there is a playlist usually called competitive or ranked that is for playing against people of equal skill level for when you really want to grind it out and improve yourself. The problem with SBMM being so strict is that now you just have two competitive playlists and no casual playlist. I am seriously having easier games in arena now than I am in casual matchmaking. I just wanted to run around and do the knife challenges not struggle to break even with nothing but the VMPstock.

5989239,1,t3_3xhe0x,In all sports competition good teams play bad teams.   The Patriots play the Browns. They play the Jags. They dont play the top teams like the Panthers and Cardinals every week. People who play COD all the time should not have their fun taken away because they have put in time and are better than the average player or noob.  New players should expect a learning curve and expect to play against better players.  Noob vs noob means they will always be a noob and that helps no one.    Good players have gotten good because they play a lot and go against better competition and learn how to play.  Now good players are punished by evening out the playing field and cant enjoy playing because well need to be so focused game in and game out to perform to the level we expect of ourselves.

6013398,0,t1_cy7umsc,Thats a very fair question and Im honestly not sure if there are other terms for these. I think that these terms pop up and come into widespread usage with negative connotations because especially on the internet the people who complain about things tend to be the loudest. To give another example Im subbed to rboardgames and over there a certain style of game is known as Ameritrash. The term initially referred to games like Monopoly and Risk that were made in America and tended to not be very good. Now the term is used as an allencompassing word for games that are thematic and tend to have player elimination vs. Euro games that are more abstract and dont have player elimination. There are some amazing Ameritrash games but the name itself still comes off as highly negative because it contains trash in it. Similarly thats why I have a problem with the terms sound whoring and head glitching but as you said there really isnt a good alternative. To get back to your original post though I just personally dont have a problem with either sound whoring or head glitching because as I said they can be countered. But thats just my opinion and I think it probably also is affected by what level of play each person is at. I could see both being unfair in more competitive settings or if the entire other team is all working together but in regular pubs I rarely have problems with either sound whoring or head glitching because its usually just one person doing it. If the other team is coordinated enough to lock down an entire half of the map by head glitching then yeah it would get annoying really quick. So yes I concede that they could be troublesome under the right circumstances but in my experience I have had no problem with either. ,blackops3,cy7vuux,1,t5_2tl1c

I also think they are trying to mold the zombies gameexperience  around those people that play zombies exclusively and love figuring things out and searching for Easter eggs. if you take a trip over to rcodzombies they are mostly talking about Shadows of Evil and not The Giantwhich is more for the casual players. ,blackops3,cy92qa2,2,t5_2tl1c

6082046,0,t3_3yuhi4,My biggest tip is to watch analyze and repeat better players actions. You have to know when you will win or lose a gun fight and know when to back off or even pick those fights. Ex. Dont challenge an m across the map with a vmp. Dont challenge a vesper up close when you have a locus. Etc. try watching competitive players play or watch pub stompers even. I like markofj so I watch him. He always shows his class setups and that can be helpful. Another huge tip is to not run straight into the middle of the map. I almost never run into the middle of the map except for when I play that occasional game of domination. If you have a headset I would definitely try using the perk in the rd slot called awareness. You have the biggest advantage when you know when someone is going to pop around a corner. If you have trouble aiming turn your sensitivity down a little bit. I use to play on  sensitivity and was barely holding a . kd. I have since turned it down a bit to  and Im pushing a . kd.,blackops3,cygu6jl,1,t5_2tl1c

6099736,0,t3_3z3f1e,I dont know why people keep recommending Nuktown.. I do not agree with them mainly because there are three kinds of people that play that mode.. Spawn trappersChallenge completionistsScrubsI would actually HIGHLY recommend Domination. I know small maps mean easy knifing right? They do BUT they also mean faster spawning.. You have a time from when you stab to when you can stab again and close quarters small maps will end you..Use this classGhostSixth SenseHardwiredTrackerBlast suppressorDead silenceThat means six perks one knife three Greeds. Your goal is to play for your streak so dont do something stupid like rush a known headglitch spot.. Learn flanking paths and remember that slide knifing is literally your only way to close distance to snag a kill. I am also the player with the most kills with a combat knife in Bo trust me when I say that I know how to get killstreaks with just a knife. Good luck and have fun.,blackops3,cyiz7sr,3,t5_2tl1c

6105656,0,t1_cyjn756,Yep thats you which you like and feel rewarded for because it gives you an advantage over anybody who doesnt know that. Really my prob lays in why HP replaced HQ which had random rotation and everybody was on the same playing feild everytime. This just rewards those who play continuously and I dont really mind anchoring I think its a part of the game mode and one of the main reason I dont like the game mode but when the game rewards the spawn flipped losers and gives them a cheap win because the timer was stopped and Im playing solo with a bunch of randoms then it warrants some complaining and hopefully gets taken out of pub.

6127346,0,t1_cym3lmt,I think you need to realized that win isnt a linear skill measurement. If you have a  win ratio and I have a  win ratio you are not  better than me. In fact you are much more. Additionally not everyone brings an A game every game they could bring their B or C game and everyones range of what composes their A game vs their C game is vastly different.  The argument youre making is that Im this insert rank player so I should be put with people of said rank which is a fine and dandy thought if you were playing in some type of ranked ladder system. TRIGGER WARNINGYoure not. Youre playing in public lobbies where people can jump in and out of games. The whole view point that you think youre specifically being targeted because you have a higher spm is ludicrous. Hell a good portion of the reason that you have a high spm is being matched up against AND with those that dont. If you were to make a lobby full of  spm players the spm would plummet. There is only so many points that can be had so many objectives to take people to kill. So quit trying to play victim to feed your ego.TLDR  Everyone is placed into a lobby that is meant to bring you closer to  wl. Deal with it.,blackops3,cym4672,2,t5_2tl1c

Team balancing would delay starting of each round until teams are balanced big problem in ground war. Change pistol headshot challenge to  instead of . Change the HaymakerBrecci headshot challenge to  instead of . Killstreaks should be change per class MA should have different load out to an SMG class.

With scuf you need a magnetic key to map the buttons but with elite you can do it on the app in a flash.  I liked the elite so much that I purchased a Xim just to use it on my ps.  I went with the Xim because it will not run cheating scripts like the CronusMAX PLUS will.  the back paddles and stick height options will help your game  little but its not going to make you an amazing player.

6341851,0,t3_42ht8a,The current state of the PC version of the game is hard to explain. Population wise I would say I have no trouble finding lobbies but it really depends on the game mode. TDM Dom and Chaos Moshpit are always populated as well as many of the HC modes but outside of that it will take some time to get into a game if you can find one at all.For a mini review of the PC version I would say the game has two major issues Controller aim assist and weapon balance. The reason the game is so populated compared to past CODs is Treyarchs support for controllers and PC. This seems like a good thing as MKB should absolutely dominate over controllers right? But unfortunately Treyarchs implementation of aim assist called autoaim by my friends gives controller players an advantage in many situations. In a game about mobility it is really easy to move around quickly and juke out other players. However the aim assist on controllers will follow your movements and your evasion will almost always not work. Im a MKB player myself and I would say I have above average aim yet I cant follow a persons movement to the same degree as a controller. It has gotten to the point where I know somebody is using a controller before I watch the kill cam because I died that fast. While this is super annoying its not gamebreaking and it is nice to have the larger player base.The weapon balance is the main issue that people will complain about with reason. The weapon balance is horrible in this game on PC at least on MKB. I cannot think of any reason to use an assault rifle as they are outclass in every way by either an LMG sniper or SMG. Some guns are legitimately broken because of how effective they are on mouse and keyboard most notably being the P and the Drakon. Treyarch removed or reduced aim assist to balance the Snipers on consoles but the MKB players dont receive that negative and as a result Snipers are very overpowered on PC. Specialists are also effected. I see people talking about how good the Scythe is but on PC it doesnt stand a chance compared to weapons like the Drakon. Other specialists most notably the Purifier are very strong on PC as the precision of the mouse and its rapid movement make it trivial to use. And with PCDev making it clear that he sees no reason to have separate weapon balances for PC and Console I dont expect this to change.This may sound like a negative review of the game but I assure you it is not. Im loving BO and plan on going to Prestige Master. I just want to make it clear that the game does have its issues on PC and its up to you whether oyu can deal with them. If you are like me and are going to go for Dark Matter using some guns are terribly painful Im in the middle of the ARs now and feel like Im shooting rubber bullets. But when I use guns and specialists that I enjoy the game is among the best CODs Ive ever played.Oh and lastly the game is somewhat demanding on PC so unless you have a fairly modern rig it may not have the best performance.,blackops3,czahxqv,4,t5_2tl1c

6384412,0,t3_4344dh,this is a common misconception.  one of the criticisms of this game seems to be the maps are boring.personally i do not understand this argument as it is usually only explained about this far and i think the real problem is the person behind the argument really doesnt like something else about the game but has not thought it through enough to realize what it is.if you scatter cosmetic details and objects inside the buildings for example these are just more things that players can potentially get caught on since now developers need to consider that players can almost literally interact with every inch of the map due to the new movement mechanics.ive played practically every cod and i dont see what was so great about the old maps... more to the point i think people under it all really want a return to old school cod movement but havent yet come to this conclusion on their own yet.,blackops3,czfc866,1,t5_2tl1c

6385178,0,t1_czff13z,And thats fine. Ill test it. But you also shouldnt make an argument against it when you have no ability to test it yourself. Your argument becomes Its not true because I havent seen it. In your mind you should be thinking However since I cant put up  UAVs as a solo player maybe it is possible and I have yet to see it happen. Once you see  UAVs up and see that its not a HATR then you can make the claim with confidence. This is how we expand out knowledge using the scientific method and logic avoid hypothesis and logical fallacies.,blackops3,czffdkw,0,t5_2tl1c
6385268,0,t1_czfdyai,I like Dom as well even though its one of the most painful modes when youre solo vs a coordinated team. Mercenary Moshpit has Domination Uplink Safeguard CTF and SampD. I always quit when SampD comes up and Domination gets voted for more than anything else so thats good. Dom with no parties is soooooo much better when youre running solo.,blackops3,czffqxn,3,t5_2tl1c
6385303,0,t1_czffdkw,Im making the argument from it not being reported anywhere from it never happening in ground war where there are  people on each team yet not once has the UAV turned into a HATR. Ive seen the UAV sweep turn into a HATR when a HATR was called in but never once did the UAV turn into a HATR cause another UAV was put up. If it was true everyone in a party would have a UAV and they would all save it to use together. There would be a HATR in every single game where there was a party. No one does this cause it doesnt work. Here is a question for you since you have friends to group with. Why dont you do it every game?? Once you figured that out wouldnt it have been extremely smart for  of you to save a UAV to use at the same time? I know I would be telling everyone I grouped with to save their UAV so we can combine them into a HATR. Yet none of this happens and it appears that even you and your friends dont do this even though you believe it is true. ,blackops3,czffw50,1,t5_2tl1c

HOWEVER if I watch a kill feed and this guy is acting like he has Parkinsons or something is constantly flipping between two guns then randomly strafejumps sideways and headshots me with a quickscope from a sniper rifle?

Problems only get fixed in the AAA business if so many people complain that they are afraid of losing money over it.This means we need MORE complaining  and we need less useless arguments about how the arguing is useless or its not at all treyarchs fault lol or whatever Either complain about the issues or ignore the topics. Complaining about the complaining will only add more complaining  but that extra complaining has no purpose outside of being contrary in nature. It really isnt hard to ignore these topics if you dont want to read them. Meanwhile Im sure there are at least a couple trearch guys on here each day monitoring the complaint levels to some degree.

There were probably hundreds of thousands of players with higher spm and kd then me on TDM in Ghosts but because I dedicated more time I was higher on the leaderboard.

Now dont get me wrong I think the vesper is way too strong but its nowhere near the problem that people make it out to be. Its definitely not an MP from mw or a vector from ghosts. Most players cant kill you with a vesper unless they barrel stuff you with the thing because their ability to control recoil is as poor as it can be.,blackops3,czkn245,2,t5_2tl1c

Something changed for certain. I am on XB and didnt see a patch so has to be server side right?,blackops3,czkxzu7,1,t5_2tl1c

Every time you die from range make note bc it will probably continue to happen from that spot... Lastly go on twich tv or youtube amp watch a really good player...

6496547,0,t1_czr18rw,I just found the entire post ridiculous to be honest.Show us some proof otherwise I cant take what you say seriously. I mean I could make a post exactly like yours going It is suspicious how every time I engage in a gun fight with a prestige  I find that I lag. If you understand where I am coming from.Perhaps you just lose gun fights more often against those players as they have clearly put more time into the game than someone who is not on Master Prestige. Let us apply some basic logic here so Master Prestiges will on average be a better COD player than a non master prestige. You could even assume that they have better internet than non master prestiges they play more often probably invested more into gaming so they have better internet. As a consequence they will most likely have a better connection than non master prestiges and this will affect your gun fights against them. So it is fairly safe to say that on average Master Prestiges are better players have better internet and consequently a better connection to the game. So Master Prestiges will kill you easier than non Master Prestiges on the rationale that they are better players and also have a better connection to the game.The idea that a certain prestige will give an advantage when it comes to internet connection is absolutely ridiculous. Prestiges are just an aesthetic element when it comes to connection. There is just no way that your prestige level would make opponents lag. Applying some basic logic will help you reach a decent conclusion that does not make you sound like a typical COD kiddie complaining about lag. Be better than that.,blackops3,czrahha,1,t5_2tl1c

The current climate stems from this childlike entitlement about hey you told me one thing and changed your mind and I cant have it! wtf! Theres such little perspective here its abhorrent.and the more frustrated versiongt Holy shit a couple of weapons you might get wont break the game. Sorry if you feel entitled to get stuff. Yeah okay we get it you want things. You paid money. You dont want to pay more money. Okay then dont. End of story. The game will still function fine. I guarantee you competitive games will not be ruled by semiauto rifles amp crossbows. You will still have fun. If you truly care about balancing play arena.

6557670,0,t1_czwnyxa,I dont think people are dumb for not being upset. My question is this...why do people expect them to give stuff away? When we all signed up for the expansion pass it was with the understanding that we were getting nuketown four dlc packs the giant bonus camos etc. Nowhere in there did they include new weapons. And those weapons can be acquired for free just by playing the game. I get that some people may spend the money and pull the slot machine until they get what they want but you dont have to. If you just play you can get what you are looking for. At the end of the day the video game industry is a business. And in that business devs and publishers alike are in it to make money. It costs money to develop new content. Its hard to understand why we as gamers want to pay our  on the game and expect everything to be free from that point on. Thats not how the world works. If you remember way back when we used to spend  on a SNES game and once you bought it that was it. No patches. No additional content. We are much better off now as gamers as to what content we have access too. ,blackops3,czxm84w,0,t5_2tl1c

6571129,0,t1_czyu23i,Adding RF to the MoW is a complete waste of a create a class slot the minuscule difference in fire time does absolutely nothing to TTK even if you land all the necessary shots. Let me relay the best advice Ive ever gotten on this subreddit use attachments that compliment a weapons advantages instead of using attachments to make up for a weapons weaknesses. Create a class slots are way too valuable to try and make a weapon overcome its deficiencies instead focus on making the weapon the best in class with what it does well. So with the Man O War focus on using high caliber which increases the headshot multiplier for ARs by . Use long barrel as well which increases the damage ranges by . Use grip to reduce recoil by . These are significant improvements for ARs this is what should be focused on. Other weapon types have attachments that enhance their characteristics.,blackops3,czz0ccn,3,t5_2tl1c

Try to do them on the small maps like Evac building by C Domination flag Combine Lab or A dom building by doorway Skyjacked camp in the double window roomengine room in the middle I got them there or if you happen to be in a big map like Havoc I would try to hangout in the building upstairs by the window room doorway or window.

6601967,0,t1_d026h2j,I dont tell people in lobbies to play better either but my original post was about how I evaluate who my teammates and opponents are.  Someone asked if that meant my requirement for a bad player meant that they were bad.  I responded by saying a bad player doesnt have to be a bad teammate and what bad players can do to help.The thing is bad players who are also bad teammates have fun in a selfish way just like people who only care about themselves in real life ruin things for others.  Yes youre having the time of your life going crazy negative and giving the other team streaks to black out the sky and then refuse to help to shoot it down.  Yes you bought the game to have fun.  Yes that is exactly how you want to play to have fun.  Its not a requirement for others to be okay with you for it because your fun is ruining the fun of  other people.People who say I play how I want because I have fun and who cares are the same people who in real life would say sure Im an asshole but its who I am.

Of course you can only unlock what is available at your level.Since there are  levels you can only unlock  items plus a free token at the beginning which you use to unlock one out of eight Specialist weaponsabilities to use. And there are more than  items. So in order to use them all you need to prestige since each time you prestige you get to unlock one item for use permanently.  Fresh Start other than resetting your profile and giving it a clean slate also unlocks an optional challenge for XP.Cryptokey is one of the games virtual currencies which you use to buy supply drops in the Black Market menu. The supply drops unlock mostly cosmetic items weapon camos taunts and gestures for your Specialists cosmetic variations of weapon attachments calling cards emblems reticles etc... though recently it has been adding new weapons as well currently there are  melee weapons and  guns. Additionally you can pay extra money for COD Points which act as a secondary currency for supply drops.Finally PC multiplayer community is not very big but depending on where you live your game mode variety may differ.

6639715,0,t3_46l2sn,IMHO there are  sides to this. To call the hate blind isnt fair to the other side because BO has done a lot of things wrong. Let me talk about those briefly Flinch. The poor mans toughness we got is worthy of the highest levels of hate. They have added a mechanic of random to gunfights which benefits lower skilled players more than higher skilled players. No one wants to aim at the moon when they get hit. This compresses the skill gap. Lag. PS US West has been plagued with shitty connections since day . To this day I can not play a game without getting at least  person per match skipping out. Headglitches. There are a plethora of campy headglitch locations on each map. I dont mind a few areas of cover to lock down a high traffic area but almost every single lane on every map has a place where you can head glitch. This combined with the flinch makes for a very frustrating experience. This compresses the skill gap. Autoaim. BO has the highest levels of auto aim that I have seen in COD. Ive been playing since MW and I have never before had the game aim for me through a wall or straight up take over my controls. This compresses the skill gap. Supply drops. Also worthy of the highest amount of hate. Unfortunately it looks like since Activision has discovered gambling and this will be in all future COD games. It was fine with cosmetic gear but once they put guns in the drops they pissed off a lot of us redditors which is why the game gets lots of hate. Maps. Most maps fall into the standard lane format. This is a double edged sword. They work and play well but they lack variety. Transparency. Specifically with patch notes. Changes arent communicated right away or even at all.These are the big things wrong with the game. There are other minor things but I dont think those are worth the argumentdiscussion. I hope this helps clarify why the game gets some hate...some of it is deserved.EditI forgot something very important Team Balancing amp Parties. A huge major flaw with the game is that v game modes can have teams that are v or in some cases even more lopsided. The game also splits up parties with pathetic frequency and it can be challenging to get parties together Lobby is not joinable error. Also there is no way to promote someone to party leader...you all have to leave and rejoin.,blackops3,d063r6b,61,t5_2tl1c

I like this when you get into a game already in progress and of course you get put on a team thats getting pummelled which is why that spot was open for you to get in to . The enemy does not expect to actually get challenged they usually run around like madmen thinking that everyone on the other team will be distracted or running from the streaks.

He goes   points  caps  defends. He gets over  keys I got just over . keys. What accounts for that?Excellent work though.I wish it would award keys based off score too.

We might as well be playing blindfolded.A lot of people understand the concept of lagcompensation but theres no technical explanation for it that can justify how bad this games lagcompensation is compared to some other games.Something is definitely off about the way this games lagcompensation tries amp fails to compensate and its so bad that it often cancels out skill as a factor when outcomes are determined.This is a much bigger problem than it should be in  especially for a billiondollarselling game series.,blackops3,d07xf5q,26,t5_2tl1c

6673381,0,t1_d09ko81,They asked you to try a different console and I didnt see that you did. I read that you tried multiple discs but the reason they want to try another console is to rule out a hardware issue. Possible try a local gamestop and ask them if you can drop the disk off for them to try to install while you go eat lunch and maybe offer them a sammich for helping out. The Gamestops around here are usually really helpful. It could be an issue with your HD if it can write to but not read from all the sectors. Another test could be if you have an external drive set that up for the xbox and install it there and see how it goes. But since you say you have tried multiple discs on the same console I am leaning towards it being the console. One issue I ran into with a few games is that sometimes it prompts for an update before you start installing it. This caused a few hangs for me on Watchdogs I think. I installed after saying no to the update then did the update and was fine. Curious to see what it might be.,blackops3,d09l30k,2,t5_2tl1c

It obviously cant work  of the time but for the most part it seems like they do a good job. Rewarding playing for sitting in the hardpoint would be encouraging the whole team to pile into the hardpoint which is definitely NOT the right way to play hardpoint. You still get extra points for getting kills from the hardpoint or when youre attacking it. Passively gaining points in there would just encourage everyone to clump up and camp in the point which is strategically a terrible idea so Treyarc doesnt want to reward players for doing it.

However Arch does it the oldschool way where you can kill your teammates and its OK unless you kill  of them in one match.There are times when Im shooting an enemy and a teammate gets in the way of my bullets.  It happens.  Im not trying to eliminate all TKs.  I can even take the occasional TK when its done out of reaction i.e. coming around a corner in a door etc.  What gets my goat is when teammates walk up to you and shootstabbutt you on purpose.

6792057,0,t3_48rgci,Ive been using bumper jumpers tactical for a couple of months now.I would say after a solid day or so of burning out I got pretty used to it.  Besides the obvious pro of being able to aim while jumping I think that activating your specialist ability is quicker only using your right hand especially for twitch responses like the ripper or glitch.   The major downside is throwing tacticals is not pretty awkward since holding down the button and moving the right joystick is impossible so you have to either preaim then toss or hit the throw button and quickly aim where you are throwing it during the animation. ,blackops3,d0m62rf,1,t5_2tl1c

6953388,0,t1_d148smc,What got me thinking about this was when I started getting an understanding for how bullet penetration works. For example when you shoot thru a wall there are  wall types in regards to penetration.  thru  lets say  being none  being low  being medium and  being high and the same goes for weapons with shotguns being none vesper and pistols being low most ARs being medium and snipers shieva and some of the LMGs being high penetration. Ive never gotten any collaterals by using medium penetration weapons like ARs but you can with any of the high penetration weapons. I also tried to research but couldnt find anything on at what level a character in the game can be penetrated Id assume this falls into around the same as what I listed as  earlier... Low penetration which requires a High pen weapon to shoot through them and then looking at Marvels weapon stats chart I couldnt find any info relating to what adding a FMJ does exactly stat wise. And thinking about how many times you encounter  enemies at once and get killed because your shooting at one and they sponge your bullets causing you to have no chance to get a kill on the second guy whos also shooting at you but by then it becomes too late. By using a high pen weapon youd be able to win those battles more often because your bullets penetrate them rather than sponge into them. I tried running the FMJ on a KN medium level penetration weapon and didnt seem to hit any collaterals but I dont think I tested long enough. I know I wrote a lot to explain this correctly but Im unsure if its correct that a medium pen weapon can be brought to the level of a high pen weapon by adding the FMJ.,blackops3,d14hyuf,1,t5_2tl1c

I never throw my body on the B flag for instance without clearing ahead a bit and maximizing the odds of me or my teammates if its the better move to stay pushed up for cutoffs successfully capturing the flag. Pushing up past the flag bombsite robot etc often encourages the more sheepish teammates to push up a bit behind me and help on the objective because they quickly realize if they continue to hang back they wont get any kills. Dont hang back and wait for a teammate to make the first move forward be the guy that pushes up in a smart manner and encourages teammates to follow.,blackops3,d1516dl,3,t5_2tl1c

6994892,1,t3_4bfwto,Seriously CoD Black Ops  is my second favorite CoD ever cant beat the classic Black Ops . Even though Treyarch and Vondy get so much shit people need to stop and look at what theyve done in Black Ops ! They balanced the new movement system perfectly and made it so smooth and flowing. They added over  Cosmetic items which you can acquire for free. They added Specialists and did it wonderfully. Almost all of the guns are fun to use rare in a CoD game and have an edge in some part of the battlefield. Dark Matter Master Prestige  and Dark ops lets everyone continue playing for even longer possibly even when the next CoD is out. Zombies is fun and has been expanded and given serious thought. Liquid Divinium and Gobblegum. Mod Tools coming to PC soon. Free Run Nightmares DOA  are all added and have lots of features. Campaign is Coop and has new Realistic Mode. Theater mode returns for all. Hero Armor. PAINT your own gun camouflages! NUKTOWN and Skyjacked. All perks are useful and even. Quickscoping now more difficult and harder to accomplish since SMGs and ARs can overpower it. So many XP Weekends!  Master Calling Cards.So yeah I just love how Treyarch always bring in new stuff. They brought in Camos and customization for the first time in Black ops  and made the first futuristic CoD in Black ops . Now we have Black Ops  A pure masterpiece. ,blackops3,d197pm1,0,t5_2tl1c

Should companies such as Gillette give the blades and shaving cream for free? No they shouldnt...no one ever complains about that shitmaybe when they initally buy blades bc those shits are expensive bc you paid for their razor people dont feel entitled for blades.  People bought the season pass you arnt entitled for crap. Great from a business standpoint tbh.

7043424,0,t3_4c37xn,I agree with pretty much everything. When I first heard they were doing BO instead of a setting from the past WWII or otherwise I initially wrote the game off and decided to buy Battlefront as my shooter for the time being. I was still am so damn sick of futuristic settings as it give the excuse for countless bullshit tech equipmentattachmentskillstreaks which take away from the gun on gun action from the prime days of CoD which IMO is MWWAWMW. Then I heard about how Battlefront was online only along with lots of other things that I didnt like about it and ended up buying BO instead. Like every other CoD title for the past few years I played and enjoyed it a ton up through about JanFeb at which point I started to lose interest. With the addition of weapons only through the black market I completely lost interest together. Aside from occasionally checking CoD subs mostly for the crazy trickshots that get posted I have pretty much moved on from the game but it is seriously a problem how they went about introducing additional weaponcharacter content into the game. If the next title is from a real war setting in the past whether its WWII Vietnam or literally anything that isnt fictional or ultramodernfuture there is a good chance ill get it otherwise there is no appeal in CoD series for me at this point. ,blackops3,d1eq9qp,4,t5_2tl1c

And the bad SBMM is also detrimental because if you roll with a full coordinated squad that means you will get really bad enemy combatants more often.

7046838,0,t1_d1f34h6,Its the opposite way around for me I rush an area and see a sneaky bastard in the corner of my eye camping and I shoot them before I realise it wasnt an enemy. Its because of the infuriatingly bad spawn system on game modes such as TDM and KC. It flips too easily and spawns enemies all over the fucking shop you have no fucking clue where enemies are some games.My team spawns one end of the map and I run over to the other shoot a couple of enemies and rush up to their spawn. Start gunning and what do you know Ive killed  teammates that have literally just spawned  seconds behind the enemy I just killed. Spawns shouldnt swap until there is a teammate stood very close to the enemies spawn. When a couple of teammates get within  yards of that side of the map it spawns the enemies over the other side. Im constantly running from one side to the other just to find teammates some games.It spawns enemies right next to each other! In nuketown yesterday on numerous occasions when I spawned in I looked to my side and there was an enemy or two that had just spawned as well. I mean WTF!!!!REVENGE SPAWNS!! I will get killed by someone only for the game to literally spawn me  meters away around the corner  steps left and I shoot them almost instantly after theyve killed me. It happens the other way around as well I will kill someone and they either kill me straight after FROM BEHIND!! sometimes or Ill get a kill feed on them lmao.

7061132,0,t1_d1gops3,The mindset. Similar to Destiny I enjoyed the game until I started getting barraged with content that was just a cheap advertisement for MTs. Activision isnt putting new guns camos etc. in Supply Drops because they want people to enjoy them. Theyre putting them in there to get you to buy CP as much as possible. RNG MTs are the worst thing to happen to video games since dayone DLC.They are quite literally a slot machine. And when I sign on to play CoD? I get a big screen saying play our slot machine! Every. Time. I didnt pay  for the game so that I could be asked to gamble. And what do you get in that slot machine? Its not just taunts and Calling Cards which used to be  acquireable ingame but now I need to either get lucky or spend money for the chance to get them. How nice of Activision now its weapons. Weapons that are dangled over players heads while Activision says Hey these are Free! If youre lucky enough. If not you can pay us to get the chance to win them in our slot machine!And who falls for this? Children and gambling addicts which are exactly the people Activision is targeting. But hey Its not really gambling! Its just a lot of spinning lights and loud sounds that you can put money into for the chance at rewards. Thats not gambling at all. And I gave money to people that promote this? That sucks and it makes me regret my purchase.TLDR I didnt pay full price for a game to get the same daily spend more money!

It isnt that they are any more powerful than when used singularly but that the enemy cant focus on one to take it out. They are aiming at the Wraith? A RAPS will kill them or Iteammate will kill them due to the HATR and it is the same if they try to go for the other streaks.  A slow start in TDM can pretty much blow up once the streaks roll in. I remember one game when I made it slowly to the streaks well slower than normal since I could barely find them.

7128345,0,t1_d1oe35u,Do you want to have a reasonable conversation? Or are you just going to refer to the dissenting opinion as a circle jerk and brush it off?The backlash exists because anybody with even a modicum of integrity knows that this is shitty business practice on the part of Activision and by that I mean highly questionable and essentially unethical.Activision knows full well that their player base isnt all adults indeed quite the contrary and they know they are manipulating the suggestible minds of literally hundreds of thousands of kids into spending their or their parents hard earned money on bull shit that preys on evolutionderived hueristics within such developing minds and this is not even mentioning how these SDs affect adult minds.Sure you may want to just say its poor parenting and youre not wrong. But that doesnt make Activision right. Its akin to flavored cigarettes. Its been deemed unethical business practice to sell candy flavored cigarettes with bright packaging and to even advertise them generally speaking but hypothetically speaking nobody would be forcing your kid to have a candy flavored cigarette if cigarette companies did advertise them and sell them in stores. Youd just be a shitty parent. Think that over for a second though. Would you really deserve that title if a business was going that far out of their way to manipulate children into getting their product? And do you see how the cigarette companies would be able to hide behind well these are for adults not kids so if a kid gets into this our hands are clean. Fuck that thats not how it works its about the bottom line and whoever is buying is contributing to that bottom line plain and simple. So Activision knows what the fuck is up. Theyre not dumb. What theyre really saying isnt our hands are actually clean theyre saying our hands are clean... on paper right just like communism wouldnt actually work but it does work on paper.Clearly we see that there is such a thing as unethical business practice that may take the form of among many others unmentioned preying on the vulnerable and weak for the sake of greed which is fucked up and wrong no matter how you sugarcoat it or what youre sugarcoating whether cigarettes or sweet sweet guns.The bottom line is that Activision is taking advantage of its consumers and thats why people need to have these conversations. Moreover just like candyflavored cigarettes systems like this should just be banned in general. It may not be gambling in its strictest legal sense but gamblinglike behavior is what Activision is exploiting here in the hopes that people cant see through their faulty reasoning processes e.g. gamblers fallacy and realize that they shouldnt give a dime to activision for the chance to get the weapon theyd so like to play with.That pissed off feeling that everyone has isnt just a subjective feeling. Its an objective moral intuition that we all agree upon like having the intuition that stealing money from an elderly dementia patient is wrong that leads us to moral outrage. It is quite literally outrageous that Activision would pull this bull shit and we havent even gotten into the applied ethics minutiae regarding how Activisions actions in putting nonreskinned weapons in SDs is wrong in a very particular sense.EDIT My apologies for continuously editing this there is just so much I could say on this topic because it has left me quite incensed. And the funny part? For the most part I like the supply drop system! though the CK earn rate could be buffed a bit. IDGAF about knife reskins though its cool if you get one but theyre not worth anything more than a dollar or two. If everything had stayed cosmetic behind those RNGs there would be no issue. Nobody deserves to have a particular knife reskin or cosmetic item that doesnt alter gameplay. But every purchaser of this game or at least the SP holders deserves an equal chance to play with the gameplayaltering weapons that others get to play with regardless of what tier gun they are.And for the apologists who argue that the guns arent that good anyway so what? Half the fucking reason these guns are awesome are the imposed limitations on the guns. Its what makes it fun like running around with the ballista iron sights in blops while others played with full auto fals remys etc. Let me tell you I was lucky enough in this insane system to have gotten the marshall and all I have to say is that playing with this gun is a fucking blast because you have to play smart with it. Dont listen to anybody talking down these weapons. They may not be competitive to the highest degree but theyre all fucking fun as hell which is the whole point of playing a videogame in the first place fun.And theres Activision saying fuck you. want to have more fun like your friends?

Because its a waste of money in ATVIs eyes. They even said that there is a hybrid system and that the game will pick whats best for you in  of all cases dedicated servers are better than listen servers with up to  players so thats a lame excuse.

I faced the same players every day and they were all spread around EU north Africa and even east cost US from time to time because the player pool was so small.

Does that mean video game play time should be regulated by the government? I dont think so. There are always extreme cases for anything that is popular. Also companies do not use the same method as casinos because it is made very clear that you wont ever get more back than what you spent. That is a very key difference. So basically youre saying trading card games should be covered under gambling? That is a ridiculous notion which anyone who has played one of those games will find absurd. Furthermore trading cards are not a new concept. Baseball cards have been around since the late th century.

All time is played at night after pm when the girls go to bed.Its all about the balance and you WILL achieve it. Itll be hard at first but thats what being a parent is! You CAN find time to play! Just keep momma bear happy get the sleep you need when you can and support that kiddo! Its rare that I dont play at night. My gf understands that its something to help me destress from the day but she makes sure to say something if she would rather I fall asleep with her cuddle her put the baby to bed so she can do things etc. But I still get to play! Eventually it will come to you thinking about spending time with them rather than playing possibly! Thats what happened to me anyway and I wouldnt change it!I mean Im an avg amplt kd player and Im almost prestige  and Ive taken a good bit of daysweeks of not playing just to take a break and be with the girls.Being a dad is amazing but you can also have your time!

Not anymore though the recoil still isnt anywhere near as easy to control as the original prenerf Vesper.As it stands the Vesper is more skillbased because you have to be able to control the recoil for it to be viable. The problem is if they do a second buff to reduce the recoil to prenerf levels people will once again complain that the Vesper is OP especially considering that the VMP and Kuda have now been nerfed. So yeah its hard to judge  its certainly viable but difficult to use. Another buff may make it OP once again.,blackops3,d2flhbq,3,t5_2tl1c

Just press A against the wall and itll jump and automount.If you can be patient and walk around to locations where you can jumpmount instead of boost jump then run awareness. If you like to flank but like to be quick about it then run BS and just catch them off guard. However one thing to keep in mind that even with my  headsets I can still hear someone boost jumping with BS. I wont see it on the map but I still hear the sound so take that as you will.

According to the wiki it fires x pellets with the lowest damage rolls of DMG per pellet you will hit  points of extra damage. Add this to the Long Barrel max range damage of  and you dont have a kill in Core. Long Barrel max range    x   Normal max range    x   So Long Barrel can actually impede your killing potential with the Argus a detriment should we say. Learning engagement distances is very important with shotguns the Argus is very good at teaching you this. ,blackops3,d2oi9bw,2,t5_2tl1c

Same thing with Domination just play it like a game of Hardpoint where the Hardpoint is always the B flag.

If you got rid of all those and just had the MR it would come down to who had the modded controller. If they made a sniper one I think it would really hurt the game it would encourage more sniping in other gamemodes I know what youre thinking when I say that they would all be in that gamemode yeah but when they get good enough theyll move somewhere else where they are not getting one shotted.TLDR  pistols would be one sided due to modded controllers. Quickscoping ruined other cods imo and should stay out of this one. Melee only would be pretty sick.,blackops3,d37gegs,2,t5_2tl1c

If its just UAVs and CUAVs going up I run a launcher but  I run my typical perks of Ghost Fast Hands and Dead Silence.  However as soon as the higher level streaks start going up and coming out on the ground I switch to a class with  EMPS Black Cell Blind Eye Cold blooded and Engineer.  I will immediately throw myself off the map to get that class loaded quickly.   I may be getting stomped by the other team... but Im going to do my very best to annihilate every one of their scorestreaks quickly.... I love hearing the tears about it back in lobby DNow heres MY request from fellow teammates.  If you see a teammate with their nose in a launcher looking towards the sky... PLEASE stick around and give them some cover.  Its so fking annoying when teammates just trot off and I get killed shooting stuff down.  I run ghost... I dont even need to shoot that shit down Im doing it to help the team... how about a little reciprocal help?,blackops3,d3bujsd,1,t5_2tl1c

Its underrated and almost no one uses it because the VMP kills slightly quicker. Give the VMP a break. It takes more skill to use than a Kuda at long range and melts close range it should be that way when you have AR laser beams like the M that basically one burst every know and then close range slap rapid fire into it and its a melt machine from any range.

8274848,0,t3_4ssezt,Ive liked most of the DLC. People complain a lot on here so Ill give my two cents which are mostly positive but keep in mind I only play core and hardcore TDM and FFA as I am a solo player maybe the DLC maps are terrible for objective game modes and thats why people complain I dunno. People hate on splash but I like it gives you more of an opportunity to work with LMGs and ARs than most other maps. People say all the maps are too small but then they say splash is too big.  I dont mind skyjacked either not sure why people seem to not like it its just an intense map that you have to have a lot of map awareness in order to succeed. Rise and gauntlet I dont care for because I dont think they flow very well and theyre tough to control unless youre in a party which I never am. From the second DLC I really liked knockout. That map can be played a lot of different ways so you never know what youre going to get when that map comes up which I find fun. There isnt one strategy that will work on that map every time so every game is a little different and a challenge and I like that. Spire is ok fun in the fact that its one of the few maps that has a wide open area but every game is basically the same and you know what youre getting into when that map comes up so it gets a little stale at times. Rift I really like as theyre a lot of different ways to control that map which I really like. Verge Im not a huge fan as there arent any real power positions on it that a solo player can take advantage of. Looks like it would be fun in some of the objective modes though. As for the newest ones Im still getting used to them as I havent had time to play much lately. But from what I can tell I seem to really enjoy Empire and Cryogen. Especially Cryogen as it seems to be very unique and could have some very interesting flow on it. Rumble Im getting the feeling its kind of like Spire in that every time you play every game is pretty much going to be the same thing so I might get bored of that one. Only played Berserk once and it was in a FFA match so I couldnt get a real feel for it. Seems like theres a few power positions but that wall run in middle might make the flow weird in other game types. Will be interesting to see how my opinion of that map changes.,blackops3,d5bwxoz,8,t5_2tl1c

This game is way more fun that way. Whateverwatching pamaj or spratt i really feelsee that they are always getting so ahead in connection somehow... Pamaj can miss someone and their shoot aint coming until he pops his next bullet... This looks like bullshit to me there is something unfair these guys do maybe its just staying on top in the router game.. But srsly if you guys dont see this there is something wrong. I bet there is a short delay you can get past with the right router.. I bet I even heard someone talk about this.Btw I got badass Internet Ethernet cable no wifi and a ms display. Still not feeling superior in the way I see these guys getting ahead.

8374277,0,t3_4uay7b,Dont go into super obvious spots were people constantly flank and check. If you dont mind destroying your KD snipe on smaller maps and in close quarters. Thats how a lot of players develop reaction time with snipers. Also pay attention to your mini map position yourself with a long open line of sight towards the direction your teammates are away from and predict the spawn and where theyll come from. You can ease into it or just throw yourself into the worst situations and battle through. After you kill someone or miss them. Assume theyre going around to try to flank you most people wont challenge you if they do pretend to run around the corner and then jump back around with your secondary weapon when they get close to you. I usually always run Six Sense and Fast hands. I also like the thermal optic with suppressor. Rk with extended mag or dual wield is nice. If you want to save a slot just run the MR with nothing.

8400709,0,t3_4uos0n,I enjoy sniping in this game but not quite as much as in previous CoDs due to the MOVEMENT System not the lack of aim assist surprisingly. I hate to have to look up  degrees from the horizon and then at where the enemies will be on the ground to make sure nobody is boost jumping over to me with a vmp. I can definitely enjoy BO sniping as long as it is in moderation. Having a smg as a secondary also helps so that I dont have to jump on an objective with a sniper rifle. Personally I like MW quickscoping the best and then BO because I could go a whole game in MW and miss only a handful of shots and BO qs took a ton of skill to master. What these two games have in common in this aspect is that it is soooo satisfying to go on a qs tear. I feel that both BO and AW lack that. ,blackops3,d5rmvai,1,t5_2tl1c

8436910,0,t1_d5w51j2,Im not morally opposed to gambling I do it myself occasionally. What im opposed to is the quite shocking lack of transparency. In order to statistically guarantee a chance of getting a weapon not the weapon of your choice just A weapon you have to pay either equivalent to or in excess of the base cost of the game itself. I cannot quote you the exact odds as I read them somewhere else and cannot present them straight away but I assure you they were correct.Not making that common knowledge is shady if you have to dig around Reddit and the wider internet to find this out its evidently unclear to the majority of casual gamers. Backed up by an army of Youtube sheep showing them spending literally s of dollars it validates and encourages the practice coupled with the odds heavily stacked against you and that information not being clear. I absolutely object to that.Furthermore I know quality might be subjective and value is a hard thing to define. But I fail to see how the monetary value of a supply drop equates to the price they charge.

Another thing that happened to me once last week and again earlier today is I was in a dedi lobby the game ended I stayed in the lobby but the next game was on a pp all of a sudden. I dont know a ton about this stuff but for those that do why is this happening? I also notice that if a bunch of streaks get called in like wraith and raps together the frame rate drops like crazy. None of these thing ever happened for me the first  or  months the game was out. For those of you that dont experience this be grateful. I thought a lot of people posting these types of threads awhile ago just had network issues on their end until it started happening to me. I live on the east coastusapennsylvania. I have Comcast internet. Any suggestions or tips would be very much appreciated. ,blackops3,d5yy2ma,1,t5_2tl1c

8607785,0,t3_4xpjym,Honestly there are no problems with this mechanic.  If I have good aim and good enemyprediction skills I should be justly rewarded for it and the sniper rifles are the only guns that actually reward that skill in this game.  The classes of guns that typically demand good aim arent that rewarding in this game.  Burst guns are too weak the Sheiva is too slow and oneshotkill shotguns have too little range.  However were they strong enough youd be complaining about those guns instead of sniper rifles just like people complain about the other shotguns now.  The sniper rifles are also the only ones that consistently reward players who use advanced movement with oneshot kills.  The shotguns are too weak in this regard as they dont have enough range to consistently eliminate players on the ground from a wallrun the distance between the top of a wall and the opponent on the ground is at times too far away to reliably OSK nor do they offer enough range to kill players when the user is on the ground.  Lets take the Argus as an example.  If youre aimed in and on target but your target is ever so slightly further away than .m you wont get a kill.  You need a sniper rifle for something you could do from the hip in previous games.  The normal range at which you can get an OSK is x the range of MWs knife w Commando and .x the range of the BO knife.  Sniper rifles dont have those problems.  Sure you have to take the time to aim which is easy when you know when you should be aiming already like entering buildings or using the time afforded to you when jumping from a wall to engage an enemy but if your aim is on you will get the kill.  And in a game plagued by inconsistency thats a really reassuring thing.,blackops3,d6hkh6l,0,t5_2tl1c

8615104,0,t3_4xtxsm,the new system is vastly superior from a balance perspectivethey can do a better job at minmaxing weapon OSK distances and make a minimum hit situationthere was nothing worse than playing SnD in blops  and landing a fourth hitmarker with your r just to get nailed in the chest by some quickscopers final roundalso this allows the shotguns to get more range without being potentially lethal at that range making it so a player doesnt feel useless bringing a shotgun to a fight to cap an objective in the open but without giving them the potential to spray down a whole teamthere is some work to be done for sure. The KRM felt too weak in this game to me and the haymaker was useless for someone who had above abysmal aim less hits to kill with an smg at close range... cmon nowi havent played multiplayer since shortly after the dlc  dropped on ps so i dont know of the current changesthe argus was also far too strong before i feel it would have been better leaving it as a slug to force players into the ADS role the weapon was intended to be used in they could have made hip fire give the slug terrible aim always hitting on the outside of the crosshairs or somethingthe argus would ever so occasionally not get the OSK when you were ADS because of a lack of luck with pellet spread  slugs entirely remove this possibility at least the way the ksg slug workedi think black ops  has gotten shotguns done the best overall for the franchise to date with black ops  being a close second and world at war being very good as well for what it was,blackops3,d6ihi5c,2,t5_2tl1c

8659556,0,t1_d6nuexh,Yea thats what I was thinking. Without stock equipped the ADS strafing speed of most of the SMGs is  of your movement speed which is twice as fast as the  u get with ARs. A  difference is quite the disparity. Especially in a game that has small to medium size maps and fast paced gameplay such as bo. I think a moderate buff would prevent people from feeling pigeonholed into using the vmp esp now that the Kuda and vesper arent what they once were Treyarch will likely see even more players using the VMP. Im kinda in the camp that thinks there wasnt anything really wrong with the Kuda or the MoW. Atleast not with the Kudas three shot range and the MoWs ADS but they nerfed them and now I dont even use them anymore. FeelsSadManId really love to see Treyarch strive to get players back onto their game and in the process make it a much more varied experience. I genuinely feel boosting ADS strafing for ARs as well as a modest buff to stock so the  you currently get from it isnt encroaching on Bo status and becomes a crutch attachment is a fun way to get people excited to not only play more with ARs but get people to log in more for the few months we have before IW drops. ,blackops3,d6o26ll,1,t5_2tl1c

I am sure I am in the majority and thats why you probably will never see it change to be more realistic. Sucks for people like you who prefer more realistic and tactical battles but thats just the way it has been for a while with CoD and as you can see with Infinite Warfare its not likely to ever be what you want.,blackops3,d6s4a2n,1,t5_2tl1c

If youre in any map other than Nuketown have a sniper or LMG class ready and ADS the moment you spawn. Most of the time you have to kill the enemies waiting for you to spawn so be ready for them. Sometimes you have the option to move to the side lanes and flank in order to flip the spawn. When you can tell that your spawn is being pushed never run forwards immediately after spawning.If youre playing Nuketown you and your teammates have to push forwards as a team in order to regain map control. If the majority of your team decides to stay inside or behind the house in your spawn youre out of luck.

Always have a secondary that you havent gotten gold yet.  Have a launcher or a pistol or a combat knife so you will naturally build up kills with them.  Do the longshots in hardcore for the assault rifles.Use the weapons religiously until youre finished with them.  It will help you get used to them and get better with them.  On the flip side know when to switch classes.  Dont go  using a pistol or a sniper if its not the right mode map or lobby.  Dom is best for the launchers since so many people get streaks there.

8784572,0,t1_d73fkqt,gt great one burst potentialPotential being the key word.  Actual performance is substantially different as even the best players have far less than  accuracy.  Watch this video and tell me how many oneburst kills this player gets where the enemy is not standing completely still or running straight towards them.  TLDW?  Its .  He gets  oneburst kills in total but only one against a target moving perpendicular to him and thats at very close range.  And this is a good player so we can assume that in a single game the average player will never get a oneburst kill.  And without that oneburst kill the XR and MA drop significantly in effectiveness.  In fact they are beaten by most automatic ARs in TTK assuming at least one miss the MoW and ICR are only better in specific situations.  For a quick illustration of why this is consider that the theoretical minimum TTK of the HVK ms is faster than the XRs total burst delay the ms gap between shots  and  and slightly slower than the MAs ms total delay.  So now that we know that we wont get oneburst kills and that we lose fights against other AR users if we didnt start them.  We also know that the suppressor will have a minimal impact on TTK at short range because of how fast the gun fires the performance will remain more consistent than with the automatic guns most notably the MA which requires the least accuracy across  bursts to get a kill AND has better accuracy bonuses to begin with.  Therefore the suppressor is a musthave for the burst guns.  ,blackops3,d73qsq0,-1,t5_2tl1c

What theater mode does is simply save the same data thats already sent to the serverhost as part of gameplay player movement actions etc and play it back so it requires virtually no additional resources. The real cause of the lag is simply poorly designed netcode and unreliable servers and the frameratetexture loading issues are caused by poor optimization possibly a memory leak of some kind or issues when reading data from the hard drive. As much as I prefer Treyarchs overall game design by far it is a fact that IW are generally more competent in the purely technical aspects maybe because they implement far less features in their games.,blackops3,d7fr4l5,8,t5_2tl1c

8893179,0,t1_d7gh0vs,top xbox players had similar movement skills at the highest level it was more of a difference in playstyles. PC players had a faster and more frantic playstyle so naturally the smaller more chaotic maps played to their favour. xbox players were more about map control from power positions farming for titans and getting control of the match through titancontrol. the thing is this KBM is far superior when it comes to aiming there is no way around it. the vast majority of casual players wont care if some people use KBM on console but take someone like me who is somewhere between competitive and casual a good player that just wants to chill in pubs most of the time but still be competitive about ityou cant have people like me questioning every single lost gunfight as to wether I actually got outgunnedoutskilled or if it was just that the other player was playing with KBM. I play on console because its more comfortable. I agree using an inferior input device controller to do that under the assumption that everyone else has the same disadvantage so when I play against other players its the skill that determines the outcome of a gunfight not the input device. you cant have KBM players in that environment even if its just a handfull. ,blackops3,d7gu0ov,1,t5_2tl1c

What kinds of game modes do you play? If its Dom or Uplink or something youre in for a rough time if you play solo especially at night. If thats the case maybe try TDM which is primarily what I play. I think around a . KD is actually ideal because team balancing will ensure that all the tryhards like me end up with most of the scrubs who hipfire rocks and go  while the nd and rd highest guys get the consistent guys who arent amazing but can hold their own and dont rely on being carried to a win.

Basically you have to do really well several matches in a row to see any sort of increase in your ratio once you get into high kill numbers like wolfeerine said. But it doesnt seem to work the same the other way. A few bad or mediocre matches in a row will drop it almost immediately.

This should be something that wouldnt be super hard to make Id think since lots could come from your infected mod.In CodWaW there was a mod called ZombieX which was basically a multiplayer zombie game mode. Im looking for someone who can help make a similar mod for bo.I know its unlikely that many people have enough experience with the mod tools since they were only released recently but I thought Id try my luck to see if anyone could do this.First build would obviously be very basic but would love to find someone who would work and help us by becoming a longterm dev for the mod. I know there was and there should still be a strong community for the game mode and if not Im sure that with how the mod can play out that we will be able to create one.The mod is similar to the current infected mod to some extent but I want to get something closer to what zombieX was.I have a bit of money I can put towards this not a huge amount but some since Im a student and have a few ideas that could help support the dev as well as us for when the dedicated server files are released we can grow a dedicated community that will keep on returning and want to support us. Pm if your are interested and like I said I have some money I can spend on this not a huge amount but some. I can give you a better idea what would be needed in the mod and then we can see if we can work out a price to make it.,blackops3,d8sgtlb,3,t5_2tl1c

Yes you stay off the minimap but it doesnt really mater with the way the maps flow in this game.

I also use bumper jumper tactical layout.But lets get to the juice of sniping and what you may be doing wrong. If youre hardscoping somebody I have found its a lot easier to lead your shot and let them walk into it. It doesnt have to be a long distance but its better than trying to get a shot off while tracking. Also your setup in general has a lot to do with success with sniping. You have one bullet you need to connect with so are you hard wired and what type of display are you using? When you start adding up all the latency rather that is input latency or response time or wifi latency it can make the difference between connecting on your shots or not.

The specialists are really interesting characters and in my opinion theyre being wasted if theyre reserved for multiplayer and a few audio logs. I know that Treyarch are a very creative talented and ambitious studio. But I and many other people felt that BOs campaign was just too out there. It was just too much. Too confusing.

11443091,0,t1_dfszwgz,First off Seths channel was always a pub stomping channel. It grew with more competitive content with a big influence from Nadeshot. Seth has adapted and improved as a competitive player getting more hill time in S in AW than anyone else iirc and has also worked harder on pushing spawns and slaying constructively as apposed to just picking up kills. But Scump was always a slayer and this is what comes natural to him. It could be argued that the best way to defend is to attack i dont think anyone minds having a player on their team who consistently pulls out streaks.You will also find Scump does jump on an flag if . He has to for the win or . It is clear to do so. I too am a player that runs straight for B my classes for objective game modes such as DOM have  slots to try to make sure that for most scenarios i have something that may work this includes having trophies with smoke trophies with EMPs trophies with concussions trophies with flash trophies with nades concussion and flash. I also run a Blackcell. There is nothing worse than thinking that someone or the team isnt trying to do something that will win the game that includes slaying out pushing spawns taking out streaks pushing the obj even flipping spawns as a last straw but the big thing here isDont jump on B unless you are reasonably sure you are safe to do so try to have a shot at on coming traffic only hiding for the capturecontest if you know you have covering support. Otherwise your just a sitting duck. When approaching B off the rip get a trophy out early that should help you get closer to B then put one near the B Flag. Tac mask is a great alternative to anything in DOM. There will be times when you just need to throw bodies on the flag as a contend for a few seconds may make the difference but try to make sure of you get the first kill and force the enemy to trade. As an objective player entry kills are a must if you can get one with a team mate behind you then maybe he can trade who picks you up. If you know you have people prepared to get stuck in try to wait for them and go in as a duo having  players all playing the objective separately is also helping no one. Dont just fly into B DOM on breach and only expect to see  person try to isolate the gun fights ADSing to get one before possibly flying in. Sometimes watch back in theatre some of your good games and bad games see what you done wrong.Everyone appreciates an objective player but racking up deaths doing so isnt beneficial. play smart. These are just my thoughts and what i say to myself and try to practice what i preach i am not saying your bad your doing things wrong etc etc but you are coming off a little salty.Cant all be a scump nothing wrong with being a Teepee. ,blackops3,dft2b86,1,t5_2tl1c

The fact that you only need one burst with this thing to kill is mind blowing to me,blackops3,dgpvian,2,t5_2tl1c
