728371,0,t3_22h0no,Another thing I just realizedgt How are war bases ordered in the war map?The bases are ordered from highest to lowest strength. The highest strength war bases are at the top of the war map. Trophies have no influence on the order of bases.So we could try to attack bases near our strength by ascertaining where we are in the order.,RedditLight,cgn2i97,1,t5_2zz2m
