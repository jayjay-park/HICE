2971832,0,t1_co5r1cb,Hey thanks for asking! Yeah the last game was as much of a mood pick as a composition pick. Ive found that in solo queue team composition is less important than in a  man team because truly effective linking of ultimates is much harder to coordinate through the keyboard rather than voice. Hec is good vs Lee if he doesnt get a huge lead. Hec is susceptible to burst damage early. I like him vs Ori because it forces Ori to be on the ball with her ultimate to actually hit you. I like him vs Ez because his charge forces Ez to E to get away. You can then follow up with your ultimate and kill him. This is harder if he gets an Iceborn Gauntlet. I actually abused Kayles lack of mobility  on  twice that game both times charging in on her with my combo ulting after her shield and using the small fear to actually run away in order to give enough time to get my charge back up. At which point I charged her again and killed her. A lot of the time the way I pick my jungle is by what I think will be effective against the enemy ADC. This is why I tend to play jungles with a dash of some sort. I treat most games like this Help where I can in early laning  try and disrupt a gank if I can or pick off one person that overextends. Then farm and look for kills that can be gained using my high mobility I almost always buy boots of mobility. I think those boots serve one purpose  close the gap during initial contact. The dash your jungler has compensates for the loss of movement speed once you start fighting.Then comes late game. At that point with junglers like Xin and Hec I lock in on the ADC and wait for mistakes in teamfights. If theyre farther than flash range from their support theyre going to die even if I die doing so.I have moved FAR away from supportdisable junglers because Ive found other players inconsistent in their ability to finish kills I set up. Plus the changes to heal and sash make their disables unreliable.Having confidence in your ability to make impactful plays with whatever champ you picked is just as important as picking the right champ for your team comp. For instance I won just right around  of my ish games as jungle shaco last season I basically carried my way from gold  to plat  with him. I love playing shaco but I think the recent item changes and Riot s refusal to bring his box up to date have made him ineffective in any game that I dont get a  level lead on the enemy jungler. In season  I won  of about  Vi games and took myself from something like silver  to gold .All in all find who works for you and play them with aggression and confidence.Edit tons of edits Im on mobile. Edit  feel free to drop in on my stream Ill talk you through a game and show you how I routinely end up with ish kills on Xin.,loldads,co5wv3x,1,t5_33pme

3300341,0,t3_2wjmdi,I realize this thread was started  days ago but Im really interested in playing in ranked s.  Im  pretty OK at the game but tired of the shenanigans that go on sometimes and would like to play with some older more mature players. Now by mature I mean not raging  no matter how old I get things like fart jokes remain funny so theres that.Im currently not ranked and just playing my provisional games which Im currently . I can play any role needed and really dont have a preference. I actually do play with some others and part of a small gaming clan who uses Teamspeak which any teammate would be welcome to join but most are not interested in ranked s teams which I am. I love the coordination of teams and objectives.Please if youre part of a team who sounds like what Im looking for please hit me up in game  IGN XSVIN NA Server,loldads,cp4grdz,2,t5_33pme

Well you dont have to build dmg late game  shes just as potent if you build CDR and mana aka frozen heart baby!. So in short your team lacks a tank  you build tanky Karma. Your team lacks ap dmg you build dmg. Shes versatile as such Id say. And she deals a ton of dmg levels   .,loldads,d09p1oe,2,t5_33pme

8865638,0,t3_4ztw5u,I think a commentary on game play while people are playing would be cool.  Help out some players learn and kind of learn from each other.  I can help out if need be do whatever.  I can see a lot of macro game play bot lane is my specialty. If i could recommend make it a stream that has set people that can get on give comments and some time set aside to let other players in and let them say some stuff.  If done right this could be a very good idea and would benefit everyone.  Maybe in between games is the best time to have guests come in and make some comments and maybe they see something and had info that could benefit the group.,loldads,d7dix1j,1,t5_33pme
