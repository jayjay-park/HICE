The extra damage means you can finish a HQ in one less hit and generally when attacking people you want to get rid of their defenses as soon as possible. Defenses are strong and generally melt through troops so you want to get rid of them asap by disabling them shock getting rid of them off the bat GBE or avoiding them all together.

3111436,0,t1_cokevu9,gt The statue rolls are only redone once per updatecorrect I read about this and understand how rolls are done. I also understand the chances of receiving a low roll versus a high roll for a statue is skewed towards the low roll which is typical for these types of games.Interesting that you say to get rid of my red statues for right now but I have nothing to replace them with. My endgame is to only have Red statues and some dark for gunboat energy  RR. Oh and I mistyped as my total PSC is    from an idol and guardian respectively. I have two Red guardians    for troops damage.What should I replace my Red troop damage with? RR? PSC? Also is troop damage not worth it in an offense oriented game? Or is only troop health worth it.gt I cant tell you not to cheat but seriously dont cheat.If it wasnt for xmod I wouldnt be playing. I came from playing CoC without cheats as the game was well rounded however this game is really limiting.  While I played CoC more seriously than casually BoomBeach is more of an afterthough to keep me busy while upgrades in CoC take  weeks.Slip up once in an attack by a tiny bit and youll probably lose your entire army and retreating is probably suicide. Rebuilding an army is very cost prohibitive and frustrating.  of bases around me are lvl when Im lvl.. And yes I know about VPs which are stacked against us. Before I started simulating statues I rolled  times  gunboat energy on all my dark idols. Thats hoseshit and I imagine the frustration is a lot worse rolling a min Masterpiece.Simply put this game is frustrating without sandboxing abilities and I feel SuperCell hasnt quite mastered the enjoyability of this game like they have with their previous games.While I understand cheating is looked down on and banned for in this sub I dont feel like Im cheating other players.

3453198,0,t3_2zrl8s,Id recommend watching videos perhaps. Also there have been some troop changes since last summer and if I had to take a wild shot in the dark you might have been used to using Warriors back then. Well Warriors still work but they are a lot weaker and not quite as fast as they used to be in destroying a base.Conversely Tanks have gotten a lot stronger than before and if you can upgrade your Landing Crafts to hold  that would be great. Otherwise Heavy  Zooka is still plenty strong.,BoomBeach,cplw3bj,2,t5_2z1d9
3466918,0,t3_2zvlp6,Mate resource reward is honestly the way to go to get resources rather than greens. Magma and Purple is atm the best types..

It made me realize I was too worried about RLs which is a typical problem for most players anyway. RLs are just loud and arent a big enough threat unless you run into too many.

3611621,0,t3_31o2ln,My first masterpiece may have been great or not but because of the way I didnt expand my radar much to begin with I had a fuck load of life and not much of anything else. So when I created it it was  stone and stone is one resource that I actually produce too much of I go looking for buildings with a higher proportion of stone to get it off my hands. So I blew it up before deploying in favour of  gold guardian. Im always short on gold and Ive only get  statues I dont want  green ones,BoomBeach,cq3y8va,1,t5_2z1d9
3624614,0,t1_cq5bvb2,ok well... you are a lot more limited in terms of GBE so its a bit tricky. I would advise that you do a test attack without deploying troops. Just attack and use barrageartillery on the r launcher to see if you can take it out and if so how much GBE do you have left after. The way I would go about it in your shoes would be to take out the rlauncher deploy my troops in the leftmost corner and flare the left side edge of the map just to the left of the top left machine gun and flame thrower. This will give you a good angle of attack. You ultimately only have to take out the r launcher which you will at the start the mortar and cannon next to it the mortar will probably be dead from colateral dmg and the one top left machine gun plus flame thrower. This will create a pocket of space on the top left of the HQ from where your zookas are safe. The tricky part is deciding between  boats of heavies and  zookas or vice versa. Try one and if it fails maybe try the other option but I think its doable. If you fail  times in a row and it wasnt because of poor execution but rather your heavies die too fast then I would just let it go.  You will likely not have enough energy left after taking out the r launcher for a shock which is a shame but with good execution you should not need it. ,BoomBeach,cq5flg8,2,t5_2z1d9

3798280,0,t1_cqp73zf,Numerous Magoo is mostly right. There is a downside you really cant defend. In general Id suggestion you go for your offensive upgrades upgrade your HQ when you can meaning earlier than youd think normalMore nuanced I used to play a very passive style where my defenses were so good no one attacked me but I couldnt lose VP. All the players on my map were too tough to beat. It took forever to get the resources to upgrade things. If you are offenses are maxed its harder to get in this hole but if you start getting a bit behind its rough.I recommend keeping your defenses a bit low so you can be beat. Every time someone beats you can can basically take another player on your map. Combine that on terror days and you can get your expensive upgrades. If your defenses are strong you can also use a poor base layout. This is also important for task forces as you get intel by attacking and defending. So you want to be offensive and to do that you need to be beat to drop your VP.,BoomBeach,cqp8fbi,1,t5_2z1d9

4302626,0,t1_cs9pr6p,Thats still one extra vp.  The point is that is it very easy to rack up a ton of vps very quickly and very hard to lose them when you become overmatched.  Sure people could artificially drop very easily but as I pointed out dropping is already a prevalent strategy one that is completely ruining resource bases.  At least with my idea dropping occurs somewhat naturally so that your vp count is more likely to reflect your skill level. Besides theres a disadvantage to dropping in that your resource rewards get smaller.  People drop in coc but theres a limit to how far theyll go because at a certain point the dropoff in loot just isnt worth it.,BoomBeach,csampga,1,t5_2z1d9

Deploy in a line on the left not a clump to take out the first row of rockets faster. Use arty and barrage on rocket groups that are close together and far enough to the right that your tanks wont kill them on the way to the HQ. Use smoke to heal up now that smoked medics heal again its way more effective than shocks for this base because you can only shock a few rockets at once and you wont decrease incoming DPS by enough to let medics heal.,BoomBeach,csjahsd,1,t5_2z1d9

4653580,0,t3_3epcld,You should try to avoid defenseonly builds. This game is oriented towards offensive play more so than defensive play meaning that offenses will overpower defenses in most cases.I would start putting most if not all of your resources into your offense e.g. Gunboat Landing crafts and Troop upgrades. Always have ongoing research at your armory and try to max out your armory for your HQ level Armory lv  for HQ lv . This way even if youre matched with people levels above you youll still be able to crush em! Never be afraid to ask questions we were all in your spot at one point!

I know weapons lab seems expensive for your level but heres a few things you can do youve probably seen before on this sub to make it a lot easier.. Resource reward is your friend. Try to get an MP and probably a guardian too and boost these when you are going for a big upgrade.. Save any PVP bases that look beatable and have good loot for when you are doing a big upgrade. Boosted RR and several juicy bases will go a long way.. Try to time your sub coming back and your two op rewards to happen just as you think you will be coming to the end of your  hour attack to maximise resources.. Do your upgrade on a Terror day if you can.. Try your best not to log off until you have got the resources you need there is nothing worse than being raided when youre only gone for a few minutes.So basically just planning will make it a hell of a lot easier. ,BoomBeach,cw2sc49,3,t5_2z1d9

The tanks stand in front as the meatshield kinda like heavies in Hooka.Grens are a LOT of fun at level  but it sometimes gets down to the wire when finishing the base you have to flare right next to the base so their tosses dont miss so often.

BC takes out half their tiny troops. im more offensive but working on my defenses. ive moved my hq kind of towards the back corner and cleared out some trees. so they have a decent amount of stuff to get through before my hq.lately ive noticed the most that have been able to railroad me is tanks with medics or very high level hooka combos.some are good with swarming me riflemen. but i laugh when some swarms retreat due to my stuff killing half the swarm.if your defenses are not maxed out for your level like me you need to kind of make sure your defenses arent touching each other. this way one barrage cant easily take down a lower leveled defenses around your BC or RL. if their all clustered together their all gonna go down.i try to do the big upgrades on dr t days and days i have time to boost RRRP MPs and play a while. usually gives me what i need for the larger upgrades. but with you being much higher then me maybe you have too much radar open for what you are trying to do.,BoomBeach,cyclb47,1,t5_2z1d9

Add a shock or two and groups of cannons fall quickly. If you plan your approach you can often ignore one or more Boom Cannons. You dont need to have all the Boom Cannons down before you deploy. Youll build GBE as you go. Shock Launchers can be left alone if there arent high damage units packed in front when your tanks get in range. A line of tanks makes quick work of a shock launcher and nearby defenses. ,BoomBeach,cyjftzk,7,t5_2z1d9

However if you dont employ that strategy then the only way youll be successful is full offense.I think thats where the bias comes from since full offense requires a lot less discipline than a low vp strategy.,BoomBeach,d1phfat,1,t5_2z1d9

7152863,0,t3_4dibqq,Well we do have a beginners guide in the sidebar or here though Im not sure how much of it will apply to you.I am a mostly offensive player but obviously far from the best or even maxed but I can offer you some insight.To answer this question....gtCan hooka get me through the entire game?Pretty much. I am level  sitting around  VP my hooka is  and they are my primary attack force. It is an awesome attack strat and it stays strong for a long long time.When it comes to offense you have a priority upgrade path.  I believe someone can correct me if I am wrong but you want to upgrade HQ asap then Armory  then Sculptor Gunboat then landing crafts. Obviously storages as necessary.If you absolutely want to stick with hooka there is nothing wrong with that however I recommend at your level that you try some of the troop combinations and see how you like it. Warriors can be insanely strong and many many offense oriented players are strictly warrior attackers.Also a standard for offensive statues is generally  red masterpieces one health one damage maybe a power stone chance masterpiece followed by any arrangement of gunboat statues and resource reward statues.  The green ones are all but useless compared to the other ones in an offensive style of play.Again I wouldnt take my word as the bible as there are so many more educated and better players at this game in this subreddit but I think Im.....fairly competent..,BoomBeach,d1r7jjr,1,t5_2z1d9
7164953,0,t3_4dmnmy,This base is extremely weak against TMed which I find to be a little funny since I see tanks loaded in your LCs! Anyway a TMed player would barry your left BC and gobble up all the free GBE working his way up the left side of your base. At that point the only tank threats for him to deal with are  ST and  cannons both positioned so that he could conveniently shock multiple of them. If it were me as an HQ  Id artie the rear cannon and shock the front cannon and ST together while my tanks took care of them. In the meantime Id probably barry the rear ST.Youre in a phase of the game where defending is basically impossible so your best bet is to aggravate as many common troop comps as possible. That means MG FT and a few mintes on the HQ for the pleasure of warriors no avoidable BC and few avoidable cannons and ST for the benefit of TMeds and cheekily placed mortars and RL for the benefit of Hooka try to pick off some zooks.,BoomBeach,d1sl4sq,2,t5_2z1d9

7498684,0,t1_d2ujceo,Here is a parallel explanation. If you dont put up a shield generator at that level you can be sure somebody will smokey hooka you. If you equip your base to defeat smokey hookas then somebody will RZM you. Remember RZM took a big boost with HQ . When I say specialize your base against smokey hookas I mean do things like put an RL or a laser up against the shore. Attacked a few of those bases in my time. Some of them went well some went very badly.Once you have a shield generator its only logical to put up a SB. The component costs are precisely balanced  of each component every other combo is unbalanced with  of one component and  I think of one other.Given those prototypes the center base appears to be the best layout if youve got a lot of ice going.Why not run less ice? You will get attacked more and therefore you will lose net VP. It may no longer be possible to reliably take down leaderboard players while unboosted whereas before you could do it unboosted with smokey hookas for sure and sometimes with warriors  or heavywarriors I think never tried that last. Also less ice also opens it up to armor.The top  used to be really very inbred. They widened their matchmaking range and now I believe you can spawn a top  player at  VP or so. Im wondering if they should expand that matchmaking range all the way down to K VP. That would put players like me up against them and they might get attacked with a wider variety of troops. That could force them to introduce more variance into their setups. That said no matter how much I boost it would be very hard to take down with  boosted ice. Id love the challenge personally.,BoomBeach,d2uk89r,5,t5_2z1d9

Boom cannons will take care of grenadiers. Its possible to use grenadiers medics and  tanks on many bases. Tanks can be used with scorcherers to master concentrated boom cannons. Then you need the critters maxed. The best defence against scorcherers is to place the cannons and boom cannons spread instead of concentrated Blue statues are needed cause scorcherers with tanks boosted will take down  bases. If no mines then the zookas wil be of great support. ,BoomBeach,d37o7w6,1,t5_2z1d9

7885492,0,t3_4n75jj,So Ive downloaded this and its more about the smoothness of the movements in the game as opposed to a picture quality change.  I ran BB with the minimum performance settings fps and the brightness dropped and when moving around my map there was a noticable difference in the framerate as when I played the game on max performance settings fps and the brightness turned up. I think this only messes with the phones graphics settings so you can set up your different games to run at different settings.Picturewise I can hardly tell the difference between minimum and maximum setting but I will try and get the screenshots up for you all to view.Edit Album To get a good idea youll need to zoom in on the pictures.

For me I clear map after OP attacks so the OP dictates what I have boosted. Generally thats either nothing GBETD MP or full boost.. What you boost is going to depend on your goals. Is it greater survival of your heavies? Consider TH or TD because a dead turret cant damage you!. Are you constantly tight on GBE? OK so GBE. That kind of thing..

I sort of suspect that after the game rolls your base value it then does another roll behind the scenes to keep add or subtract one percentage point from the statue value. But I cannot prove this.Of course we all want max statues but IMO once you have a decent MP you can always supplement it with a guardian if you need.

8887638,0,t1_d7fuhcl,I suspect it may have something to do with troop behavior when not  of the smoke is in a playable area. For example flaresmoke at map edge or cramming troops among buildings. They could have made changes to the behavior above while restoring all other pathfinding behavior. Alternatively there has got to be some parameter governing the maximum number of troops per tile and they could have changed that from prior to the Cryo update.Most of the examples Ive seen involve some sort of cramped situation. In my main TF Forum Forever my attack yesterday on Machina involved some cramming and yes they did spread a bit more than I thought they would. In contrast in Bootcamp Ive been able to get all  zooks under the same final smoke in most situations. Most of my firing positions dont involve a lot of cramped quarters. Some do but I also have fewer zookas in play.In contrast Cryos are staying together in the course of a dynamic attack. We typically dont get our Cryos to cram into small spaces nor do we really want them to. So I dont find their explanations inconsistent yet.,BoomBeach,d7g62ph,0,t5_2z1d9

Remember though that theyre unpredictable so theyre very different from other troop combinations and they require a heavy offensive statue lineup  and that means you will eventually hit a VP wall with them.Max base without ice is very hard for unboosted max scorchers.

If you have constructive criticism put it out thereOK I think you should have included the word downvoting in the subject of this post to make it more descriptive. But in general I agree with you. While I get that people might not find  different how to beat Dr. Terror levels  with heavyzooka videos to be worthy of daily posting some people who post really great videos seem to get downvoted all the time. Im thinking specifically about uSolarTacoss videos while Im writing this but Im sure there are other people who produce quality videos and get them downvoted inexplicably. I guess you need a thick skin to post on reddit sometimes! ,BoomBeach,ddsg7qa,3,t5_2z1d9

10798870,0,t1_ddtpqff,My questions arent really aimed at SC theyre more aimed at players like you who dont know all the stuff that goes down. SC have never publicly responded sure. Truth be told I dont really care at this point. Theyve lost my trust entirely. However they could regain it by consistently escalating their efforts to catch modders. The initial Android ban wave was what  months to a year ago? I dont remember. It took them quite a while to catch the iOS cheats in BB assuming that is what happened despite the fact that so I hear they caught a lot in Clash.As far as Im concerned if this is really a ban wave its a down payment on ensuring Booms legacy and no more than that. Moreover I am pessimistic. Consistently escalating efforts to catch cheats are hard because you have to stay ahead of them softwarewise and you have to think like they do to adapt to their tactics e.g. it was already reported in the initial ban wave that people were using burner accounts for modding and passing the credentials around. SCs unswerving devotion to small agile teams means that the same team has to devote attention to this issue which in truth we only see affecting the very good to elite levels. I bet they just go back to business as usual after this. That said I am more than open to someone proving me wrong.,BoomBeach,ddttr74,1,t5_2z1d9

10871220,0,t3_5vdlyp,Dang that was masterful indeed. Strategically he clearly exploited a bit of a weakness in the layout. Hookas are a lot more resistant to mortars than RZM assuming the mortars dont get your zooks. Using the one smoke to get his entire formation in the blind spot of the right RL was a very good catch. The heavies also were able to take the multiple mine hits without issue whereas CRZM would need at least some of the mines down.More tactically the entry was excellent. The sniper was switching from heavy to heavy as they entered the smoke all while the zooks were shooting away. I havent seen that tactic used much. On Ransom sometimes the beach is guarded by one mortar on the right and you can drop just one smoke then do a flagonly landing in the right middle or top beach as your zooks walk into the smoke youll also see the mortar twitching as it switches and loses targets and it wont get a shot off.,BoomBeach,de1aeq6,5,t5_2z1d9

11284503,0,t3_61202u,To me this seems like the wrong fix for IG. In my mind IG is great for early and midgame players to get a huge resource windfall for a big upgrade. Reducing the number of attacks just makes it harder on them and for what reason? Because the event is too easy for endgame players?The event is still too easy for endgame players as Im pretty sure I can smash  bases if Im allowed to fail once especially with cumulative damage. And if a base is too hard for me what do I care? I can just skip the event and it makes no difference to me. I dont need the resources and there are no guaranteed crystals like in Dr. Terror. A thorny T Ill make several attempts at because I want that crystal. But if IG  has  shield gens tomorrow or something? Hah yeah. Not going to spend my gold on that one thanks!There were other much better suggestions for improving IG. Like giving the player a choice of easy normal or hard tracks and scale the loot amp power stones accordingly. ,BoomBeach,dfb2y9f,27,t5_2z1d9

11305179,0,t1_dfd6l8n,Ive been playing clash of clans and boom beach since early fall of . In the december  update of clash the th update the personal break timer bug happened which was inconvenient for the more active players and took them a couple weeks to fix iirc. Other than I dont think theres been more than one or two very minor bugs that got fixed within maybe  hours. During this time clash has gotten several new troops a new defensive building extra levels for almost everything theres been regular balancing updates for like half a year now including a few bigger ones that changed the pathingtargeting of some troopsdefenses a complete overhaul of the troop training system introduction of events friendly challenges friendly wars troop and spell events etc. All of this basically without any hiccupsbugs to speak of. Im not saying the clash community is content with all design choices e.g. heroes not being available for war attacks while being upgraded but the game is consistently functioning as designedintended despite major upgrades.Somebody in Supercell has figured out how to push out clean updates with a small agile team and boom beach team would do well to learn from them in this specific field.,BoomBeach,dfdfba3,3,t5_2z1d9

11445872,0,t1_dfst288,Its really a question of activity level and your powder needs.  There isnt really a cookie cutter answer to the question.  How many powder do you need to spend every week to keep upgrades moving? What are you TF demands?  Id say at mid game level you should be in a TF that doesnt require daily boosts to keep powder managed.  I think the ideal line up from until youre maxed out is probably  GBETDTH with  RR and  PSC.  Thats assuming your RR is  and PSC is .  I wouldnt waste a slot on anything less for those two statues.  If youre super active daily map clears you can easily earn more powder that spend if youre doing anything short of full boost.  That said it never hurts to stack it up if you can afford to.  Before I stated phoenix I went on a decently long break with only rare boosts and saved  powder pretty easily.  With nearly daily full boots I still only lost about  powder per day over the  month life of the TF.,BoomBeach,dftdo78,1,t5_2z1d9

11570714,0,t1_dg6teh8,While I rarely deploy anything line abreast I remember that in the early days of the TF update we found out the limits of Tmeds on ops the hard way  by having them get brutally slaughtered. In particular my main troop then was Tmeds and I remember trying several times to finish cores under RL fire only to have the medics run among the tanks and get killed by the rockets. So I am pretty sure that having the medics get right next to their healing targets is something thats always been part of the AI.Moreover when a different tank takes damage the medics will frequently switch targets to that tank. So if your formation is in a line they can often run from side to side.I can and will keep watch for whether or not medics move when their second healing target is within their technical range. By my interpretation of the Wiki and from my general knowledge if the target is within  tiles they shouldnt need to move immediately. Heavies have a range of . to  tiles which means they start firing when they reach  tiles and they walk to . tiles subject to the grouping algorithm so many heavies will wind up closer than .. If you flared something right next to a heavy theyd just stand in place.You can set up a test to measure the actual heal rate if you want but this has been done repeatedly for max medics all tests seem to converge on a rate of around  HPS for max medics. Youre actually speaking to one of the guys who helped highlight the issue to SC I did not discover it I think uzmotbb and GazRWood are two of the earliest discoverers. Also remember they fixed the turret targeting algorithm so it is now back to normal? I know there is a lot of technical detail to keep track of but youre bringing up points that have been found or addressed already.You are likely correct about Sparkys critter spawn animation reducing her actual DPS. But at max she has all of  base DPS. Say her critter spawn halves her effective DPS. How often do you think that is going to be your margin of victory i.e. you lost the battle for want of . DPS from Sparky? Probably not often. ,BoomBeach,dg7jo9k,1,t5_2z1d9
