8897265,0,t1_d7gxr8i,Valued citizenYour post has violated more than one of our sensible justified and absolutely correct Rules. For this reason you have been banned. Since your crime has been committed in ignorance you will have only a hour ban. You have three less any strikes incurred chances to tell us one of The Rules you broke and success means your sentence will be commuted entirely with you gaining a point in the process. Though you have violated more than one of our glorious Rules you will only get up to one point for discovering a Rule.We will leave your offending and therefore horrible content up as an example for our other citizens.Good luck!,TheRules,d7hbo9n,1,t5_3dai3
