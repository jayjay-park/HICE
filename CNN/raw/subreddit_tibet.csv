384935,0,t1_cfc5khl,honestly i dont see any point in selfimmolation. i still admire their dedication and courage but it looks like a waste of life. it makes me sad just thinking about it. ,tibet,cfknwqr,1,t5_2qhth
2560642,0,t1_cmsste2,Do you see the contradiction in what you are saying?   A You are saying that you dont have thoughts on how any country is governed.   B You are saying that religion should be kept separate from politics. B itself IS a thought on how other countries arewere governed. Youre allowed to think what you want of course. But what Im saying is that if you are willing to say that church and state should be separate then you DO have an opinion about Tibet. ,tibet,cmst9wh,1,t5_2qhth
3893016,0,t3_3453ex,Ridiculous title to this article. Ugh. Why on earth would Tibet be on this list when the press secretary did not list any other statesprovincessubnational administrative districts in any of the other fucking countries? If anything it is the entire national of China that should be annoyed that THEY were left off the condolences list. Did the press secretary start rattling off the DISTRICTS in nepal that were affected? No  so why would anyone expect him to do so for China? Just looking for excuses to talk about T politics it seems.And that line about the DL being the face of separatism is a bit disingenuous to say the least ya know considering the DL doesnt actually advocate secession. Its interesting that so much talk on this site and in these articles is about preserving T culture yet  of the actual CONTENT is about little more than the same politicized fodder. When was the last time a tibetan author musician or artist who didnt write almost exclusively about politics was discussed? ,tibet,cr01dh0,1,t5_2qhth

6088071,0,t3_3wjo3c,Much of the modern western perception of China comes from imperialism. Were to bemoan the Chinese for imposing their way on Tibet while also bemoaning China North Korea etc for not allowing us to impose our way on them?Ive seen one article talking about the complicated history of Tibet and now the Dalai Lama. Once you put away preconditioning and assumptions I really dont think it comes down to China versus Tibet and their ancient histories as much as everyone makes out. Even that is a symptom of the real reason Tibet is being incorporated into China like it is.I dont think that the history of history Tibet is as entirely important as people make it out to be. I dont think it is the core issue at all. That was a convenience. If anything the history of China is more relevant.As far as Im concerned the issue is geographical and strategic. If youre going to include history it should be more global. Things dont always happen in a bubble. You also need to consider the current and future global affairs. A leaders true job is not to be a historian. It is the manage a better present and future.Tibets strategic advantage to China is geographic and its actually more about defense and security than expansionism. Tibet is a large land mass in the south that includes a huge portion of the natural boundary of the Himalayas. Thats the true great wall of China. That natural boundary is also a border shared with other countries so would allow the safe passage of troops into the Chinese basin over that difficult natural boundary. To compound matters that boundary is by the largest and most populated area near to China. Its a vital stretch of border and natural boundary.I believe what makes things a lot worse is that ideologically even if part of China Tibet can be turned into a fifth column.Given the history of western imperialism and aggression against China and its neighboring regions much of which still persists today China can absolutely not trust an independent Tibet not to be exploited by us against China. For our own strategic advantages which are more aggressive Tibet would be a massive benefit most likely as a protectorate towards further containingsurrounding China and having a stronger military position against it. Talking about that history of interference you still have Taiwan Korea and the mess we made in the Kashmir area to mention just a few affronts.They can tittletattle about history all they want but at the end of the day its going to come down to the strategic security situation.Until the real Chinese position is understood and taken into consideration little progress will be made with Tibet. The fact that weve been habouring the Dalai Lama also means they likely have little real trust. Hes more our guy than Tibets guy.,tibet,cyhmhkx,1,t5_2qhth
6120086,0,t1_cyla7ai,Mexico is a weakness to the USA but the USA is not China and good luck with the USA invadingoccupying Mexico. Russia and China are also not making a particular effort to influence Mexico nor have they ever particularly been any kind of a threat directly to the USA. Remember they arent the aggressors.If you want to understand my argument just look at Tibet on google maps and it will make sense. Use the terrain version as well as the satellite.If it doesnt instantly make sense it may be that you are not used to thinking defensively territoriality etc. I suggest playing a few RTS games to develop this kind of thought in addition to general study of the realm. I suggest gaming because its about as close as you will get to any practical application or strategic and tactical knowledge at least territorially. Theres a difference between receptive learning and interactive learning. One of the first simple principles is defensible points and things would as in flat terrain a round border is the most defensible as it has the best ratio of area to circumference. Many modern borders have evolved according to these principles. If you did a simulation according to this and including natural barriers cheap border as its more easily defensible you would have something surprisingly similar in ways to modern borders. The post colonial era borders and some recent borders would be the most strange. In reality the complexity between China and Tibet goes beyond the simple. There are several factors that make it strategically beneficial regardless of history. Ive listed most of them briefly.,tibet,cylagv0,1,t5_2qhth
