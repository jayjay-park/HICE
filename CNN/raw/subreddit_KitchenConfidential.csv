194733,0,t3_1wbgbn,Its going well.Ive only been cooking for two years st year I cooked on the line nd year I did strictly production where I did the bread butchery desserts paste etc. etc. going into my third year currently back on the line.  I started late in the industry unlike many who started when they were  so Ive been playing catch up ever since.  Been putting in my hours I come in hours early sometimes amam before I even have to clockin pm.  A lot of the other cooks look at me like Im crazy for coming so early but guess what I never run out of my mise the souschefs never have to worry about me they dont even ask if I need help anymore because I own my station.  The hours I put in on my offtime has paid off I break down chicken faster than anyone while wasting as little at my place I can break down fish like its nothing because I didnt mind scaling cutting pinboning  fish on a regular basis just another skill to attach to my arsenal.  My bread comes out the best although still nowhere near a professional baker its a whole new craft to master my temps are near spoton on my proteins my torchons come out tight as fuck with no holes because I dont mind going that extra mile to make them super tight.And Im nowhere near the best I can be.  Everyone wants to move onto the next step and try to work for a management position.  No thanks I want to be the best cook that I can be and Im looking to move to SF or NY and get my ass kicked and humbled.  I want to be surrounded by cookschefs that will destroy me in every facet that I am good at so that I can learn from them to become a better cook.  This isnt a temporary gig for me Im in this for the long haul.  Ive read about how many cooks here dont like coming and working for free or going beyond the call of duty.  Thats fine if you just want to be average.  Name me ONE industry where people who succeed DONT put in the hours in order to achieve success.  My friend is a CPA he busts his ass off.  Vacation?  Nope hes using his vacation time to work and his hard work is paying off.  You think Michael Jordan became good by only putting in  hours and saying thats enough?  Think again every point he scored was due to years and years of drilling and practice.I know this sounds like a lot of bragging and arrogance but I work very hard everyday that I come into my job.  I want to be the best cook that I can be not the best cook that has ever existed on the planet but the best within my own limits.  I want my cooks to respect me because of my skills and knowledge and the only way to do that is to put in my dues.,KitchenConfidential,cf0mddt,15,t5_2sa8b

Nothing crazy just basic ok at what temperature does this parasite die at? how long does it take this bacteria to die at this temperature? what is the chance of this food having this parasite?Cooking for a lot of people is almost a form of religious neuroticism... they have a long list of myths and they are most assuridely MYTHS theyve been told by people that they follow out of habit most of which are obviously wrong like searing a steak seals in the juices and never bother to think about them nevermind perform a single test to see if that idea is true meanwhile these same people will test out  different theories while fixing their lawnmower or planning out their route to work or how valuable a specialist left pitcher is in the th inning. As a result their beliefs and therefore their results are wildly inconsistent and they just never know why NEWSFLASH its because theyre mostly random! and so never learn how to actually cook turning chicken into sawdust while eating a rare burger that was ground a week ago is a good example or being perpetually afraid of raw tuna or egg yolks that are runny just cause well who knows. They never understand that the entire point of cooking well is to try something taste it repeat it try it again taste it again try it again and repeat ad naseum and LEARN in the process. They see a recipe and think FUCK YEAH I CAN DO THAT never realizing that they will probably have to make that recipe about  times before they get even passable at it. Shit Ive made broccoli about  times yes I am not a professional you fuckers now in my life and Im just starting to get the hang of it and the particular recipe pattern Ive finally gotten good at took about  attempts and will probably take another  before it gets great. And history? Fuck. They have no understanding of why their ancestors fought wars over salt or even why one would fucking use salt in the first place... or acid... or a base... or why someone would float around half the world for spices food tastes like shit! or why almost all recipes in history revolve around moisture and heat and time people were poor as shit yo better braise that pig anus! or understand the dumbfounding changes introduced after WW in industrial food production and general physics a consistent temperature in an oven?!?!?! HOLY FUCK!. Then again people are stupid. For every person who understands that modern US pork that reaches  degrees in its entirety yeah you could eat it rare safely usually I know and holds it for several hours is about the safest and most delicious thing in the world there are  more who think that antibacterial soap instantly kills bacteria or that you can even kill ALL bacteria on a piece of food probably the same people that dont even realize how thoroughly bacteria covers everything at all times or that bacteria and viruses and parasites and spores are the same thing or that SpongeBob does not in fact live under the sea IRL.

I wear only latex gloves and use only a towl and an oyster knife that I have sharpened to my liking... When I say sharpened I mean honed and pointed... Most oyster knives start off pretty generic and need a little coaxing to get the desired shape thickness and point that works best for your style and the style of oysters you are opening... My absolute favorite to open are cheap gulf coast and lonesome reef because they require no special technique or knife you could literally open them with a butter knife or the handle of a spoon lol...  ,KitchenConfidential,cfzojzs,1,t5_2sa8b

847856,0,t1_ch0mg2l,Thats very generous of you but no thanks. Im not against mobileordering. Im against something which adds nothing of benefit to the restaurant and customer.My restaurant takes togo orders with customer pickup no delivery. They can be taken at any time. We receive them by phone so no answerno order not by any sort of passive system which might allow them to be placed by the customer without our knowledge. A business that specializes in delivery is going to be more focused on remotely placed customer orders and so an electronic submission isnt really different from a phone based one much easier actually so long as it is integrated with their existing workflow. But for us our entire staff is focused on the customers that are right there. They arent checking emails or answering machines for orders. This is a customer service industry and while technological solutions can ease some of the stresses it really is ultimately about positive personal interaction and timely service. Using remote ordering tools that dont having an element of customer and employee interaction essentially takes the crafting of that experience out of our hands and puts it in those of a generic application crafted by someone external to our business culture. That is a lost opportunity to provide personal service.We are a sitdown restaurant so something like your app doesnt translate well into our environment. There is a wait however the wait is in some ways deliberate as it allows for smooth service. We could take your drink and food order at the door and have the food ready for you when a table opened up. However because dining is as much about mood pacing and socialization as it is about consumption there are several stages of waiting waiting for attention should be very short from the hostess waiting to be seated provided it isnt too long will build the cachet of the experience. a busy restaurant is a desirable restaurant. a wait builds tension and anticipation and being seated releases that tension a wait for drinks and a wait for food. Good service isnt about eliminating waiting it is about breaking it up into tolerable pieces using the moments of contact to establish connections with customers and allowing them to build their own social experience in the spans in between. Certainly there can be frustrations and issues but a good restaurant overcomes those.Your app seeks to break that harmony. Were many customers to use such a tool imo several things would happenpeople would be happy to use the app but unhappy with the restaurant if there are issuesgreater impatience The customer has ordered and paid without requiring or establishing a connection with the staff. They now own that food and are owed it. Particulars of that night substituted ingredients specials personal recommendations explanations of unknown foods apologies for a long wait for a table greeting returning customers etc. would all be lost. Instead the customer has an internal clock ticking from the moment that they place the order to the point when they either receive the food or decide that the wait is unacceptable. They can start that timer at any time without any respect to the desired pacing of the restaurant or the capacity of the kitchen at that time. massive backlogs of tickets this isnt anything that kitchens dont already have to deal with but it could become much worse. Servers can pace the submission of tickets resulting in a smooth flow of food from kitchen to customer low ticket times high quality and a pleasant work environment. Or they can submit a ton of items at once resulting in lost items late tickets angry cooks and disgruntled customers. If the customers are contributing to the situation watching some sort of progress tracker with estimated delivery time on their phone it would make for some very awful nights.lower tips Front of house staff rely upon tips for the majority of their wages. Whatever issues I and many others have with this system it exists and isnt going away soon. Excepting the bartenders the FoH staff really do little more than pass the customers order to the kitchen and walk plates back and forth so at first it would seem that their job is rather redundant and easily replaceable. However they are also the interface between the customers needs and desires and the restaurants abilities and business model. Their interaction is critical in giving customers a satisfying experience and dealing with customers who arent satisfied. If we remove their primary point of contact taking orders answering questions making recommendations and replace it with an automated standardized system then we reduce their reason for being and consequently their tips while simultaneously denying the restaurant the positive effects of their services.Heres one potential issue for you to work on load balancing. The restaurant wants to serve as many people as possible. It has to dynamically balance the capabilities of the kitchen and bartenders with the needs of the guests to find seating for reservations and walkins without screwing later reservations. Different servers have different capacities some are better at large parties some can handle more tables some play better to a certain crowd. How can you improve the restaurants systems allow restaurant employees to better perform their roles? ,KitchenConfidential,ch0nlsd,2,t5_2sa8b

1296725,0,t3_28xeqz,Focusing on one plate at a time isnt exactly going to help with speed or efficiency. Im sure you must have a basic idea what items take longer to cook focus on that. Scan ahead on the bills try to wrap your head around getting the slow cooking items going  and timing them with fast cooking items. Thats the basic gist of it. But as allycakes pointed out thats something thatll take time and practice. Multitasking is fundamental in the kitchen. You really need to be aware of whats happening around you. If youre doing sets its way more efficient to do multiple sets at a time rather than one at a time. To simplify it little lets say you have a burger on the current bill and youre setting up the bun with all the toppings. Best advice is to scan ahead do a mental count of how many buns you need to set for the next few tables. Its way more efficient to set  buns at the same time compared to one at a time.

1339482,0,t3_29ef9y,Yup.  Theyve figured they are paying you right now as much as they want to pay you.  I wouldnt look forward to any monthly bonuses in the future that were close to what youve been receiving in the past or in getting favorable reactions to a request for a salary raise.  With an extended loss leader promotion it sounds like the business is retrenching rather than expanding.Productivity bonuses are great when a business is growing but Ive worked at a couple of places where my costing goals were set so high that they were for me unachievable.  With food cost there are people outside your department FOH waste promotions that might have an impact so it might not be entirely under your control.If youre responsible for tracking food costs you should have access to weekly and monthly breakdowns and you should be able to see how they are making their calculations.  In other words you shouldnt just have to take their word for it that they have or havent factored in the promotional discounts.  You should have a copy of the spreadsheet printout so you can see it yourself.As far as making ultimatums though I personally never ask for a pay increase unless I have a pending offer elsewhere to back it up.  Never so much as suggest you have such an offer but if youre turned down you pull the cord.  You should put out your resume to some places at this point.,KitchenConfidential,cikb2rl,3,t5_2sa8b

I saw for a month what a mess salad was and dreaded going over there. it looked like a shitstorm and I wanted no part of it.

1558861,0,t1_cjbnnra,gt If I understand things properly you want all working people to be able to afford all itemsReplace all with a majority.gtI guess folks who manufacture jet fighters should be the best paid guys ever?The majority of GDP is not represented by jet fighters or any heavy industry. The global economy is based on the production of consumer goods therefore there need to be consumers. If most production was of jet fighters then we are talking about a radically different social organisation that in no way represents the way capitalism has functioned in the past hundred years.gtIt still sounds like you are stating that everyone should be able to dine at restaurants.I am saying that if most food production ends up at sit down restaurants which labour statistics clearly indicate then most people need to be able to eat at sit down restaurants. Otherwise goods go unpurchased and firms go under. If the problem is isolated to the foodservice industry then all that will happen is a lot of restaurants go bankrupt however if the problem is pandemic then a general crisis occurs when huge amounts of goods sit in warehouses yet people still go without because they cant afford them. That is exactly what happened during the great depression and why to this day the US government pays farmers to leave land uncultivated in order to not cause a glut.gtI suppose its possible to meet all water needs without running water but it isnt practical.Interestingly it isnt practical for many waged labourers to cook their own meals. However I must point out yet again that the issue of luxury isnt remotely relevant. What I am arguing is that a system of production based around producing consumer products which is what a large part of the global economy is needs consumers. In a capitalist society the producers have almost always been the consumers as well. Not all but a significant majority. When these two roles manifest in separate groups of people you get a class system that can only be maintained by cottage industry. ,KitchenConfidential,cjbod93,1,t5_2sa8b

1595741,0,t1_cjg7p9n,Server here family style Italian restaurant.  Were just frustrated.  Im sure most cooks will do whatever they can to accommodate guest requests.  Last week I had a family who wanted seafood and asked us to remove the white wine from the sauces for religious reasons.  The cooks were happy to figure out a solution. My problem is that most people who ask about GF options very rarely do they have a true health concern.  Its about .  Ill give them the list of options  pasta  sauces these entrees these sides  dessert.  That one person will be thankful for those options.  The rest will challenge me and try to order anything they can only to have me shoot them down.  Yes our alfredo contains gluten.  So does the meat sauce.  No that salad dressing is not gluten free.  THEY WILL INEVITABLY ORDER AND EAT SOMETHING WITH GLUTEN telling me its not that really big of a deal and their sisters friends cousins next door neighbor went GF and all their health problems were solved and a little gluten wont hurt.  Well if they really were so sensitive a little probably would hurt which is why our cooks are required to change gloves and god knows what else before they start cooking a dish marked as GF in the computer.   I have nothing against that one person with a true sensitivityintolerance.

Great food good location HUGE prep kitchen that was to be used as a sort of commissary for their catering business and a second location that was already in the works.  Two months in said second location opens and the chef goes to run that one full time taking his sous and two line cooks.  The chef they hired to replace him was young inexperienced and had her head firmly up her ass.  She made it clear to me several times that she never would have hired me if it were up to her.  One day I had a small blowout with her.  She wanted to change the menu daily to  reflect what is fresh and seasonal which is great but I would get there at  and not be able to prep anything for lunch service until she told me what the menu was.  Long story short we had a screaming match and the next day I was informed that there just wasnt enough room in the budget to keep me.  About three months later I decide to stop in for lunch because I liked the rest of the people there and I was well liked by them.  I found out that she got fired soon after I did and caused the restaurant to lose about K in the two months she was in charge.

You could work a week making no money and wasting your time and have one good day and barely cover that minimum wage requirement that way.   I WISH it was a daily thing because when I served I definitely walked many days making less than minimum wage that day.  Not saying you cant make bank as a server but the lack of benefits they were super expensive and shit so I declined that ... Not to mention most staff doesnt work the hours to even get offered benefits and unpredictability of income was terrible.  I got a decent hourly wage job and make more now anyways.

It was far less efficient and more difficult to use than a paper ticket system crashed often and at times when we were most busy causing lost orders and worse lost payments. We often couldnt accept credit cards because the system was down. It was also tied to our employee punch in system so if it didnt work that day you couldnt record your hours and if you were first in you would have to wait for all the system updates to complete before punching in.

2242625,0,t3_2kudxk,Theres a bit of misinformation rolling around in here figured Id throw in my two cents. The accused party in a business environment has plenty of rights and its actually fairly difficult to prosecute sexual harassment without eyewitness accounts or videodocumented evidence. Also restaurants and businesses dont just tank from a lawsuit. It just doesnt work like that. Settlements arent immediately awarded paid out or even required short of appeals and court orders. Businesses also pay into insurance to cover legal responsibilities regarding lawsuits and judgement awards. You should immediately be prepared to file a temporary restraining order and do it quickly because you have a definitive window of time to apply for them. You also need to meet with your GM or Owner and GET ON THE SAME PAGE. If Im taking your word on what happened there is no case to be made and its really going to be a lesson in exchanged paperwork and depositions on your owners part. Also you cant fire someone motivated by the idea of skirting a lawsuit because that is even worse legal trouble for them. Especially if you have a clean record with no negative documentation in your name. Take a deep breath and go get a temp order then meet with your GM. ,KitchenConfidential,clow2s1,14,t5_2sa8b

A vintner doesnt plant seeds and then show up  months later expecting to see wine in bottles  and you cant expect at all that you help open a place and then show up later to collect the profits. Owning a restaurant isnt about cashing the checks. Its about nurturing a business. Its about being present  not just physically but knowing where the money is going. You actually dont need to be there but you do need to know where the money is being spent so you can make changes when changes need to be made. Restaurants are like children.

2947343,0,t3_2tv96i,You have a very naive idea of how things work. First off going to school for culinary arts is not going to give you instant credibility. You cannot just walk in and say hey I got this piece of paper from this school that says I passed some tests. Make me executive chef now. You will still be the least qualified person for the job. Second I strongly doubt your managers do absolutely nothing. Who schedules you? Who does payroll? Who keeps track of inventory and food cost? Who deals with purveyors? Who deals with cost breakdown? Who organizes reservations? Do you? No you work the line and they sit at a desk and keep numbers running to keep the restaurant from going down. There is a reason they get paid more than you because they are more important than you. And third If the executive chef owns the restaurant and told you that he wants you to go to culinary school to take his position hes bullshitting you. There is no exec job waiting for you at the end of school. If he is already capable of doing both jobs at the same time why would he pay to create a position that is not necessary? In this case its either all in your head and hes said nothing about you being executive chef or he wants to shit you over and make you kitchen manager with a shit pay. ,KitchenConfidential,co34kyz,2,t5_2sa8b

3027997,0,t1_cobsnvd,gt Saving for welldone is a timehonored tradition dating back to cuisines earliest days meat and fish cost money. Every piece of cut fabricated food must ideally be sold for three or even four times its cost in order for the chef to make his food cost percent. So what happens when the chef finds a tough slightly skanky endcut of sirloin thats been pushed repeatedly to the back of the pile? He can throw it out but thats a total loss representing a threefold loss of what it cost him per pound. He can feed it to the family which is the same as throwing it out. Or he can save for welldone  serve it to some rube who prefers to eat his meat or fish incinerated into a flavorless leathery hunk of carbon who wont be able to tell if what hes eating is food or flotsam. Ordinarily a proud chef would hate this customer hold him in contempt for destroying his fine food. But not in this case. The dumb bastard is paying for the privilege of eating his garbage!

La Taberna Downtown Napa Havent been personally but I hear its really good.  Its more of a bar but they have some awesome sounding small plates.Kitchen Door  Downtown Napa Its the concept of the restaurant to serve food we as cooks would like to eat.  It also has the added bonus of being in the Oxbow Market.  Other vendors in the market I can recommend Fatted Calf Model Bakery Napa Valley Distillery Three Twins Ice Cream and definitely Whole Spice.    Hana  Rohnert Park  Its about a  minute drive from Napa but if youre willing I think its worth.  Id pass up Morimoto for this place if you just want Sushi.

4127507,0,t1_crqqt47,No. The visible light emitted by an object as thermal radiation at a certain temperature is dependent on its melting and boiling points. See Plancks law for more information. Now unless this was at Alinea this caramel was made with table sugar which is sucrose extracted from beets. Sucrose does not have a melting point but instead decomposes into its component glucose and fructose at around  F which this definitely would have reached. Fructose melts at  F and glucose around  F so the disparity between the melting points of these monosaccharides could have resulted in a redox pyrolysis reaction where the carbon in the sugars is consumed as fuel. The color itself is determined by this reaction so the activation energy of the reaction would determine how hot it would get before turning into products. As the temp increases the atoms get more excited and as electrons move around photons or light particles are emitted. ,KitchenConfidential,crqrdp3,21,t5_2sa8b

If you do get a pull through for quick touch ups get something like lanskys pocket sharpener. It has the carbide rough side and a ceramic honing side.

Not to mention even after being told day after day to make sure his sauces were on ice to check the quality of the fish before serving it etc. he never cared to do anything as long as he got to look fresh for the customers. One afternoon I chewed him out for not doing any prep and for taking a two hour paid lunch break without telling anyone he was dipping. I brought it up to the head chef and he did nothing. That was it. He was siding with this fat lard and my experience and intelligence was being belittled. I walked out that same moment and never looked back.

I dohowever like that youve got a mix in shapes of sandwich.  that is actually kind of cute.  not something I would have done but I like the way you pulled it off.Looking at the whole tomatos lices and cucumber slices it looks to me like you cut the bread first and then assembled your sandwiches.    Try it the other way.  amke the sandwich and then with a nice sharp bread knife cut off the crusts so you have a perfect square or rectangle and then slice it into finger sandwiches.Oh!  also compress it a bit before its cut some people like their finger sandwiches near flat.

If you dont like or respect the people you are working for it is doubly hard to put in the extra effort. Life is too short. Ive never said this before but I reckon you need to take a sick day. The longest stretch I ever did was  days straight with  doubles a week and I would never do it again. You are working yourself into the ground for no reason. You are not learning anything which is the point of being an apprentice. Your employers just see you as someone they can pay shit and treat like shit that will turn up and do the job anyway. They dont even deserve notice and they do deserve to be reported. Seriously get the fuck out and sleep for a couple of days and make sure they face some kind of consequence. Too many places get away with this kind of shit because nobody does anything about it when they inevitably quit.There are good jobs out there I have one it took a while to get but I wont be leaving where I work anytime soon. It is possible. You deserve to be paid fairly and treated with respect. And from the sound of it you are the kind of person that will repay that with hard work the right attitude and a desire to always learn and improve.

Many of the better restaurants that cater to tourists in bigger cities like Bangkok and Hong Kong have no problem with serving him a steak without pepper. I think we were in greater danger from the raw turkey at the Kathmandu Hilton one Christmas. Usually the epipen diverts the need for the hospital I know youre supposed to go every time but he doesnt always but we get around that in two ways either we are dining out with a native friend or if you show up turning blue and waving a used epipen around they figure it out pretty fast. And youd be be surprised at the number of people in third world counties who have at least some English especially in customer facing jobs.

5969592,0,t1_cy24apu,I think your question looks down the wrong avenue. A lot of good hobby chefs would probably have enough basic skills to match many first time hires in kitchens as long as theyre willing to learn and be told how to do it right.  A lot of restaurants worry a lot more about untraining bad habits more than being able to teach new ones.  Which is one of the reason line cooks who learned on their feet sometimes have issue with culinary school grads because they come into the restaurant thinking they know everything whereas the dishie that watched the prep cook can just copy how the chef wants it done. The big difference in a commercial kitchen is speed and volume and consistency.  Youre taking many of the things a home cook might do or at least theyre similar and doing them at high speed high volume and for  hours straight and you have to be able to do them all pretty well keep your station clean while doing it and do it in a room full of people doing the same thing. Sure youve practiced your knife skills but youll have a better idea of where they are when youve got an hour to chop and prep  lbs of vegetables for dinner. Sure you can cook fried eggs or an omelette pretty well at home but if you take a job as a line cook in a busy breakfast place youll be cooking  eggs a morning often  and  dishes at a time keeping track of them and trying not to get any sent back because theyre over or undercooked. You can fry up a burger or grill a steak but a line cook in a steakhouse is keeping track of a bunch of orders at the same time. etc etc. ,KitchenConfidential,cy257qt,24,t5_2sa8b

Naturally we had a fuck ton of flavors but most werent hot at all. For the hot wings we had a sauce that was basically an imitation of Franks sambol and a powder that was a  mix of dried and powdered chilis mixed with powdered capsaicin. Our hot wings had a scale from  with varying levels of the sauce sambol and powder. Our hottest was  gallons of the hot sauce  cups of the powder and  cups of sambol. It was fuckin hot but it didnt have a taste. If anything maybe a little chemically but mostly just pure unadulterated heat. I could barely handle  yet we had a tiny old lady order  everyday.

Especially in a situation where your relying on them to keep everything on an even keel.Case in point i did christmas parties this past month for large business and groups. For a quarter of clients in communication they want to organize and be in charge of how the party will be run and are kurt in their responses to how they need things to be. The second this organizerleader arrives it turns into a mad max dystopia as they stop wanting to be in control and just fuck off. Thus your left attempting to herd a bunch of cats that were forced to go to their corporate party. You quickly understand the solution take away their control they receive centralized organization and a system thats been perfected in price and flow. Does the a party need a server to ensure success then they have no choice.

6686467,0,t3_4786yg,While these are my personal subjective experience I hope they might be of some use to you. Here are some lessons Ive learned from being part owner of a small bar to running a corporate chain restaurant There will be a temptation to make a lot of changes but a small town diner doesnt need to have a bunch of flashy ads or a lot of marketing. The way you describe this place makes it seem like it is already a fixture of your town.  Make sure you spend time learning each position. Know how to openclose each category  when staff are sick or quit It WILL happen. Youll probably never be as good as your regular staff but it will save you from tight spots. This is really important when you have a small number of employees. It also keeps you from getting blackmailed by employees who know that you need them to keep the place open.  Learn the cost of everything. Profit margins on a small restaurant are very very tight. This means that your dad needs to be very involved in his business. Just because a place is popular or busy does not always mean that it is making money. People may call you cheap or a Scrooge but they dont know the pain of trying to decide which repairs you can afford while making sure your people get paid on time. ,KitchenConfidential,d0axtfl,11,t5_2sa8b

Eventually the end came. The day shift would be told to clock out at  with the night shift not in until   and chef would supposedly handle the cooking. Of course if you wanted to stay after and help out off the clock you got in his good graces. Then the repairmen had to get a check up front before fixing anything.

I guess that influx of culinary school interest died down and wasnt enough to make up for people saying ENOUGH!its a funny time  food interest is at an all time high.  People are flocking to the middle of the restaurant industry away from the bottom fast food and away from the top upper end fine dining.  Chefs from all stripes are going downstream to the middle.  Customers want quality and value and restaurants are trying to find ways of doing that.  Its supposed to be a great time for the restaurant industry  chefs finally get kudos for their talent and theres TONS of interest amp learning that customers are doing. HOWEVER behind the kitchen door its another complete story.  The growth in restaurants has only made the demand for decent talent go higher. And do your point many of the good cooks  ones who have options are realizing its screwy.  Hmm.  This is going to change over the next few years  its not sustainable.

No school is enough if youre not willing to put the work into it. Its possible to do it without school but having both a degree and experience will open up doors experience alone wont.  The CIA is fuckin expensive last I heard it was like  a year.   You could go to any number of other schools and still have money left over to travel Europe.   For the price you pay for the CIA you could afford to get a bachelors in hospitality management from a good school like UNLV Texas Tech UCF etc and a culinary degree from a reputable community college.  If you have an associates in culinary arts and a bachelors from a good school youll be much better off than a bachelors in culinary arts from a trade school.be careful youre degree from a trade school Le cordon Bleu AI  etc are very unlikely to transfer.  If your parents are rich fuck it  go to the best school.   Youll get a ton of hate from those that couldnt go but its not going to hurt your career.  ,KitchenConfidential,d4tcdjd,2,t5_2sa8b

8449152,0,t3_4v4vzm,Yes it gets better.  The more skilled you become the easier the work itself is and youll find yourself expending half the time and energy to get shit done.  I never realised how stark the difference is until I worked with an old buddy of mine. He was exec I was lets say sous.  We were apprentices together back in the day so we were about the same skill level.  We had this one saucier who was decent but thought his job was way tougher than it was.  When he was eventually fired we never did replace him the chef and I would just alternate covering the station between all the other shit we did.  This saucier would come in at am every day to be ready for service.  When either one of us did the station  wed literally spend an hour each day prepping for it and were always ready.  When deliveries came wed break down the entire delivery ie. clean  portion and sous vide all the cuts in a few hours.  Saucier boy probably took  hours over  days to do one afternoon of work.  Anyhow the point is youll get better get smarter and the work will become easier.  Much easier.  As for advice on how to manage your life  try to exercise.  Even if its just a run in the morning.  Make time for it.  Eat regular meals even if its just a cold salad and protein shake.  One favourite of mine at the restaurant  salad with cold cuts and cheese.  Drink less  not sure how much you drink but limit yourself to  after work.  Even better if its at work while cleaning.  Going out after work costs hours costs sleep and limits what you can do the next day.  Also if you take care of yourself your body can make do with less sleep.  You gain hours in the day for your family.  As for the  hours per work thing if it doesnt get better move jobs.  There are lots of restaurants that are actually closed one or more days of the week holidays etc...  Its nice having a set schedule and guaranteed time off.  ,KitchenConfidential,d5xois6,1,t5_2sa8b

USDA regulations of safe temperatures are complete bullshit. USDA states all steak needs to be cooked to f internal to be safe for consumption. Which means by the time it rests you will be left with a well done steak. We get away with this in restaurants by the little disclaimer at the bottom of the menu that says undercooked meats can cause food borne illness bla bla bla consume at your own risk bla. The real problem isnt undercooking food. Its time temperature abuse before you get it at the restaurant. So always buy meat and fish from people you trust to not abuse time temperature before you get it. That being said to get a solid medium or still have some color or opaque in the middle of salmon or halibutwhich you should want you will want to aim about f sous vide and then sear hard on one side. That should bring you to about the perfect temperature for fish. If you have any other questions let me know,KitchenConfidential,d6ngkdg,3,t5_2sa8b

I have a couple of friends who are regulars too. Id really like to see the managers attitude towards all of this. Im hoping it really was a fluke! If I do decide to eat there again I think Ill order a soup first and examine it closely. If theres nothing in it that time it could be a good sign that yesterdays was just a bad batch. Maybe theyll be a bit more strict on produce cleanliness after I notify them!I do know about insect parts sometimes being present in other foods haha. I know theyre often harmless. My main concern would be if there were some in the raw food since then they might still have bacteria or something on them.

10026354,0,t3_5j4bfx,Now lets talk pancakes. Pancakes are a natural choice as a side for almost anyone who craves breakfast. Cooking pancakes on a standard flattop grill involves putting almost all of your care into the grill itself. Brick it using only a front to back motion. Circular motions tend to leave microscopic scratches thatll rip delicate pancakes and make them stick. After bricking move on to screening the grill with a green using the same back and forth motion ONLY. Season with clarified butter. Standard butter has too many impurities thatll simply burn and cause the grill to stick. When plating flip the pancakes into the upside down position then flip once more onto the plate. Go one at a time. Its easier than picking it up with a spat and using your hand to lift the pancake onto the plate. Also have a dedicated spatula for pancakes. Something that doesnt touch the baconrough items. Theyll leave little flecks of crusty food all over your pancakesgrill. And if a server doesnt take the pancakes within about a minute or two youll have to start over. ,KitchenConfidential,dbegmix,3,t5_2sa8b

When people are happy at work and feel safe knowing they wont get yelled at for making a mistake they work better and learn faster. Mistakes need to be embraced as part of the learning process not treated as a failure.

If a server makes below minimum wage the employer is required to bump their paycheck up to at least that. However minimum wage is frankly still starvation wages.  As far as using tips for business purposes in the way you mention it isnt. The employer is paying the employee. The employer is not taking money out of an employees  paycheck and using it to say buy themselves a new car or the restaurant new glassware.

I went from a corporate fuckhole to a good restaurant to a starred restaurant  never did I feel ready for it but I applied and tried again and again until I got it right. Show up looking neat  if you have a beard have it freshly trimmed. Show them that you care and thats half the game. This applies both to your application assuming you do it in person like I prefer and to your trial shift. Look tidy show you care and want to learn and thats half the game. For your applicationinterview not that Ive had a formal interview I always go for pants and a button up shirt. I only own one pair and thats the only time they got used. For the trial Ive always just had a tshirt and jeans with my chef whites in my bag. Beyond that its easy  yes chef no chef  minutes chef. ,KitchenConfidential,dcvm9c4,4,t5_2sa8b

10620278,1,t3_5rx64t,I think this is just the worst advice ever. So life didnt work out for you so now you feel the need to throw an entire industry under the bus? Ive been working in kitchens for  years. In That time I took a k investment and in  years sold it for  mil. Ive since started again and am happy to have just passed my first year in business again. Cooking food and being a decent boss. So fuck you and your average career. Im sorry things didnt pan out. But dont blame the industry. One thing thAts always stood out for me is that the industry reflects honesty. If you want to be creative and daring and smart then chances are youll make a splash. Or if you want a safe job with benefits then those positions exist too. Or if youre content grinding it out for someone else then yeah things arent going to go well for you long term.... If youre working with young people then by all means explain to them the pitfalls and opportunities that this industry avails but do not claim that this is a dead end career because my experience and the experiences of others like me say the complete opposite. ,KitchenConfidential,ddbeglv,6,t5_2sa8b

I feel like in this day and age culinary school is an unnecessary step for most cooks out there. If you have the passion and drive to succeed and already have some basic kitchen sense then culinary school is going to teach you predominantly antiquated techniques that hold little weight in todays kitchens. That being said culinary school will definitely help you develop order and organization and teach you about the old ways that laid the foundation for modern kitchens.

It goes against our moderator rules but I strongly considered scrubbing names and doing it. At that point how do I prove it wasnt me? Maybe I made the accounts. Maybe I work for Qdoba or Mors or Freebird. It opens up a whole new can of worms and if Im being honest I dont know how to go about it. I kind of also dont want to deal with it.

11318049,0,t3_61i1b4,Theres a reason your bullshit detector is going off and here is likely why.. There is almost zero likelyhood that the metal scrubbies will damage your dish machine. They likely tell you this because too many people use steel wool on things they shouldnt and while they can get pieces stuck on other equipment its the same risk of your dishwashers not paying attention to whether things come out clean or not.. This is a laughable excuse the only thing I can come up with is related to  where steel wool gets stuck on them more easily.. Again total bullshit this is reactionary due to pieces getting lost in the machine eg shaker lids etc having really shitty equipment or people breaking it assuming it was the dish machine.

You can raise your voice to be heard but yelling at your staff just illustrates your own failure to hire the right people with the right skill set andor inability to train them to your standards.If you are being yell at at work you should find another job where people act like professionals and valuerespect your contributions.
