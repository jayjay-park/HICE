7935531,0,t3_4nygf7,Hey i can clear up some of your confusions.Most sector lines are pretty clearly defined and so far there hasnt been any confusion but this server is new and many of our players choose to hide away in different corners.As for combat so far nobody has complained about pvp again the server is new and we have a lower population  players at normal times Due to how clear our rules are on pvp I doubt you will have a problem.  ,honorfall,d4811ds,2,t5_3esqp
