266537,0,t3_1x5wdx,The general recommendation is that if youre in the US and want a budget pillow Royalpillow is okay. Theyre fairly cheap and will do custom sizing but the pillows dont hold up that well in the long run and some types of filling have some leak issues. If youre not in the US unless you can find a local store youre probably going to have to spend a good amount either way so Id recommend the AampJ line of bodies. I only have experience with the DHR but absolutely love it. And AampJ is probably best known for their extremely popular AampJ WT material. ,Dakimakuras,cf8dx5m,1,t5_2tooy

779248,0,t1_cgsuqhw,Thanks. Essentially bootleggers are those that steal art from other websites and print it as their own work. Theyre extremely common pretty much all of the covers youll find on Aliexpress eBay or a host of other sites will be bootlegs. This is a weird case since the source for the cover you like is a Chinese store that sells at fairly cheap prices but the average dakimakura cover is usually gt thats often a good indicator if a cover is a bootleg or not. Anyhow it appears as if there is one other cover of the character however its pretty lewd and the preorder closed some time ago. Regardless heres the image and the covers product page.The cover you linked was done by SLolita and it is for sale on their Taobao store. I looked into the seller you had posted and Im fairly sure that theyre not affiliated with SLolita but had stolen their product images as well. SLolitas store has a few original works done by artists theyve commissioned but they also sell bootlegs as well so I wont be linking them here. Ill PM you with additional details on how you would order this cover if youd like.  ,Dakimakuras,cgsurso,4,t5_2tooy

3659164,0,t1_cq9bj4v,Its worth noting that the industry standard is typically cm x cm and those that are cm x cm are commonly bootlegs.Either way that pillow is a bit too small youll have a gap at the end on the cover that could be fairly large depending on the sizematerial of the cover you end up buying. You can roll a towel up at the bottom or something as a quick fix but if you find yourself enjoying the hobby its recommended that you buy a pillow more suited to the size of the cover. ,Dakimakuras,cq9dc3m,2,t5_2tooy

7701581,0,t1_d3hk8bc,. Undressable dakis are typically just an additional layer of fabric a tube that fits over the cover and when properly aligned will look like they have more clothes on. They may have issues of the extra part easily moving out of alignment with the rest. As for doing them as a custom daki Im not sure if people usually offer that kind of printing service or not. Would have to ask whoever you are going to have do the printing.. This question is a bit too vague.. there is no limitation on what kind of pose you put on a daki though people tend towards simpler ones of a person lying on their back so its really up to you what you want. Id suggest just browsing image sites and finding poses youre interested in and picking from things like those.. It should not cause any extra issues it is common for copyrighted characters to be printed for doujin works.,Dakimakuras,d3hm9wd,2,t5_2tooy

8931851,0,t1_d7lbxsu,Well uh... This conversation kind of exploded in the time it took me to commute home. I do want to add something that has not been said.First off your main argument for bootlegs is based on cost. Most major bootleggers charge the price of an official cover for their WT and nearly the cost of a CO cover for their peach skin. Peach skin sucks and is not worth the money they charge for it let alone the money theyre making on it as thieving bastards. Even their WT is pretty meh.I will say this though. I partially blame the way Japan handles manufacturing of collectables for how much ground bootleggers have gained in this market. I mean I get why figures are so limited since theyre D printed and handpainted. I even to an extent get why official st party covers are limited. But for like circle dakis some of them get bootlegged because of their own adherence to these anticonsumer manufacturing practices. Ill use Evening Call as a perfect example here. If there is an old cover of theirs you want it is literally impossible for you to give them money in exchange for said cover. Why? They could so take orders for old covers to be printed with new ones at the end of their preorder cycle. There just isnt an excuse for this practice in the case of circles since they print and ship themselves and if anything theyre actually turning down money from people that want to buy stuff from them. Given I would never buy a bootleg of any of their covers or anyone elses nor would I say this makes what bootleggers do at all acceptable but I feel like this practice actually kind of pushes people to buy bootlegs that otherwise wouldnt. I feel like bootleggers would not be doing nearly as well if more major circles operated more like CO or AChobby or BW.,Dakimakuras,d7lh63n,3,t5_2tooy
9147258,0,t1_d8bf52i,You can use a forwarder with Amazon Japan that is you can buy the stuff yourself and have it shipped to a company that will forward it to you.
