2393915,0,t1_cm7h0hs,Having gone through an accelerator this is the exact opposite of my experience. We got our most value through the mentorship and connections with large companies that we would have never been able to get on our own. Also got a lot from the other teams we went through the program with. While demo day did introduce us to some of our future investors majority of our investor conversations had taken place way earlier. Demo day was basically just a graduation day where we all celebrated what we had accomplished over the last few months.,StartupAccelerators,cm7lg33,2,t5_325cq
