3281865,0,t3_2xox78,I havent measuredweighed in about a month but last time I checked I had a  bust  waist . hips. Im . Currently a US dress  weighed  when I last checked. Ive definitely lost weight since then dont have access to a measuring tapescale right now since Im travelling. My goal measurements are a  bust  waist and  hips. I have a ruler body type so Im trying to be more forgiving around my waist and I usually lose inches off there the slowest. Typically I eat around  calories a day.I dont really actually have a startinggoal weight  I just want to look good. I was never overweight but the past couple years starting getting thinner and thinner without intending to and loved how defined my facial features became and how androgynous my body looked so I decided to run with it. More than anything I just want to look more nondescript so I can have the freedom to present as a boy or a girl whenever the mood strikes. They say the last  lbs are always the hardest so I wanted some motivation to beat that plateau.I already have very thin legs so hopefully my hog body will catch up ,thinspocommunity,cp2cyb5,5,t5_2vo4a

3932406,0,t1_cr4a4mj,ask if they have brown rice sushi it will be healthier! I really like seaweed salad too. If you HAVE to get sushi get something raw and with minimal sauce like definitely no tempura or anything with eel sauce. One of my BFFs moms will go out to sushi with us and get the sashimi and eat all the raw fish from the top and cut the bottom rice part in half and just eat half. ,thinspocommunity,cr4j2np,2,t5_2vo4a
4000757,0,t3_36auja,Do you gain the weight back when youre done detoxing? Everytime I fast I always gain the weight back regardless of how slowly I increase calories so I just restrict. Also how do you know that what youre losing is not just water weight? ,thinspocommunity,crcbg6r,1,t5_2vo4a

5940843,0,t1_cxycaqd,This is misinformation. Its really hard to build noticeable muscle bulk from casual weightloss oriented exercise. You would literally need to actively try to get bigger this way by eating more of the right foods and doing the right weighttraining exercises. Restriction  exercise will only make you smaller theres really no way to go in the other direction. But youre right diet does come first and its imperative to diet in conjunction with exercising. How else are you gonna be in a calorie deficit??,thinspocommunity,cxydi39,7,t5_2vo4a

9712585,0,t1_da8cehb,Haha awesome! I am indeed in the US  just for another month or so but just the same  If not for being in a place where I can sign up for swimming and yoga classes I dont know how Id make the time or hold myself accountable for exercise! I do so so so much better when I know Im expected to show up someones ticking my name off in attendance and theres a workout already devised for me to do. I feel like when I show up at the pool or gym on my own or even roll out my own yoga mat Im just hopeless and I dont know how to push myself harder. In case youre the same way is there any chance you can find a gym or exercise community near you to help? Im freaking out a little because once I move I dont have any fitness options lined up... so Im probably projecting here! lol,thinspocommunity,daaaap1,1,t5_2vo4a
