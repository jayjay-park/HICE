1426915,0,t1_civ4tzc,one tip is to try to keep within corner airspeed  knots. dodge more horisontal instead of vertical unless emergency. only sacrifice altitude to keep that . also countermeasuresjammer are freeish better to save alt to maintain energy.,falconbms,civ53d2,4,t5_2tvox

6314466,0,t1_cx4mdek,Not sure exactly but BMS was smooth as butter. Very high frame rate. I really started enjoying DCS but it needs a bit more horsepower. It was smooth on lower settings. I bought a GTX  and am now able to run DCS at very high frames with settings maxed. ,falconbms,cz7dvc8,1,t5_2tvox

8771955,0,t1_d7259u5,gtIRL it should be quite accurateExactly the opposite actually. HARMs at least everything C and older are really dumb and require constant emissions to find their target  they have no other sensors. The newer AGME AARGM and F HCSM are better  the F model has GPSINS and the E has an active radar seeker on top of that.,falconbms,d725s9m,2,t5_2tvox
9692485,0,t3_5dulgw,If youre good with DCS that honestly doesnt mean much.If you want to learn BMS you need to do the following Read the documentation.
