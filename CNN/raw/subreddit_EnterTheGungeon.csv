If you have at least one key the weight for junk is multiplied by   and so the total of the pool changes from . to .  it becomes .. or roughly . chance.If you successfully roll the downgrade it is automatically downgraded by four tiers. Unless you have the Book of Chest Anatomy then it will downgrade by  tier remain the same tier or even upgrade by  tier.Analyzing the code is quite the rabbit chase so Im afraid I wont go any deeper than that with it.

The more you play the more you understand how to cope with modification combinations. Granted some rooms are completely brutal and you have to pray to the RNG gods you get some sort of escape plan early i.e. Room clearing weapon or invincibility item. Here are a few reasons why I think it wasis an amazing decision by DodgeRollItems with immunity to firepoison can be run changing and have finally found a place where they truly matter. It gave me a true inspiration to improve again and I felt competitive cause I wanted to beat CM before Cobalt and other streamers.Truly challenging games like Gungeon should have at least  truly challenging achievement and not everything should just be time locked.every run im analyzing runs by pausing my game using A and S tier itemsweapons to clear the simplest of enemies and rooms that have been stale can now pose unexpected threatsfrustration is a driving force to push you to improve.

Which is the middle of the wall for most special rooms where secret rooms usually are.Theres also the thing Ive been ranting about forever but havent been able to get any confirmation on that normal and special secret rooms have separate spawn chancesrules. normal being a room with a chest or drops optionally surrounded by a pit and special being stuff like a challenge shrine or an NPCThe only evidence I have is that  Whenever I see two secret rooms not including guaranteed ones one is normal and the other is special and  Every special secret room seems to come off of a normal room and not a chestshopetc room.,EnterTheGungeon,def6mfk,5,t5_37d0t

Being  people to do it on steam and  to have a complete game on steam means this is probably my biggest game achievement. Check out the AStats website if you ever wonder about game achievement rarity completion. About the runGatling Gull with easy modifier dont remember what it was.Beholster with Ghost in the Shell not to bad.Cannonbalrog with Gulls Revenge Gun Queue Adreneline Rush not as bad as thermal clips but pretty bad.Wallmonger I dont remember because I killed it fast with aged bell and stinger combo. Hardest boss was Cannonbalrog as he is a nightmare in challenge mode and my items were not that great yet. Didnt have aged bell until a th floor chest and my best gun was bundle of wands which doesnt really matter to much with gun queue. I honestly dont know how I managed to ace him.th floor I found  chest and it had ghost bullets which probably made this dragun run do able. My load out wasnt the best damage wise and my stinger only had  ammo going into the fight. Had good RNG on the dragun attacks and he only daggered one time right as I got him into form  stage. The rest of the fight was pretty easy. Just rolled my way to victory although I was freaking out once I got to stage . ,EnterTheGungeon,dfrb6g5,1,t5_37d0t

11720988,0,t3_678uh5,Fellow Isaac player who started to seriously play gungeon in March.I think the main overall difference is that gungeon feels more balanced when it comes to runs. Youre not really going to have a run that is unwinnable or a a  minute steamroll run. So I feel like there is some more skill involved while playing compared to Isaac where luck can carry your run pretty easily.The level of depth in the game is fantastic. I havent gotten the final secret area of the game yet but like Isaac its a work in progress from getting to mom to moms heart to isaac etc. Dodging is so very important in this game as many rooms can get much more chaotic than in Isaac and bosses are not as easy. Knowing when to shoot and when to dodge can make a world of difference. There is definitely more of a bullet hell aspect here.Enemies still require some time to learn their patterns and who to deal with first or last.Consumables in this game are much harder to come by compared to Isaac. Keys and hearts are a much much more limited resources so you need to be strategic about how you use them since there are two item rooms per floor  the shop can sometimes be locked  special rooms that are generated could be locked.Overall its a more challenging game but I think it relies more on skill and you wont necessarily get screwed by a terrible set of items.,EnterTheGungeon,dgolqvp,14,t5_37d0t
