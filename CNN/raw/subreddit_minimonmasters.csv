6264481,0,t3_41bnn1,The things you must consider are so much your actual hero your power your minimons and where want you to go. I try to explain if you have a goparta attack up and a manticore defence up and your hero is lucky you must choose ariel because shes an healer and can help you during stages. But if you have a mimic attck up only for dark heroes so you must choose gilgamesh. otherwise if you wanna your hero autoheal choose rin so you can use minimons for put up her attack or defence without thinking how she will heal up. ,minimonmasters,cz1p9ns,1,t5_3a86l
