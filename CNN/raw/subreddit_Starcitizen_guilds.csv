We want to enjoy every aspect of Star Citizen so when the Mining work is done we will try it all and have fun doing it.Papa,Starcitizen_guilds,cws8vip,1,t5_2xxjh

5818850,0,t3_3tq89y,Id like to sign up if youll have me!Im  hope that doesnt matter live on the East Coast of the USA not far from New York and Ive thought about playing Star Citizen a lot with friends. All my IRL friends are console gamers and those that arent dont have the money for a rig that can handle Star Citizen. Ive played Elite Dangerous to death and Ive gotten quite good but the game is now boring due to a lack of other players. Theres only so much fun for a solo player to have. Ive thought a lot about Star Citizen and realized that Id have immensely more fun with a network of players to cruise the galaxy with. The main thing that drew me to your post was the small community aspect. Ive always steered clear of large guilds because they lack that community feel and require management that shouldnt have to exist with a smaller group of friends and allies.I honestly enjoy all playstyles depending on my mood. Some days Ill want to hop in a nimble fighter and go at it other days Id rather go smuggling in a hulking transport ship while dodging through asteroids to stay off the radar. Heck maybe we can band together and fly a Constellation or better!The one thing I think is worth mentioning is that I dont want to kick off my career in Star Citizen until I feel the game has reached an acceptable level of development. Whether this be early beta or the games final launch Id like my first Star Citizen RP experience to be as good as it can be free of excessive bugs impossible missions and other issues that ruin immersion and remind you that youre playing an unpolished game. I am extremely excited for what Star Citizen is going to be but not what it is currently. It simply hasnt been in development for long enough.Anyway Im really looking forward to the game and I think Ill enjoy it even more with friends. If youll have me Id love to join. Thanks!,Starcitizen_guilds,cxidsk5,1,t5_2xxjh
