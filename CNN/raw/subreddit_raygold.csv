Stephen King The New York Times Book Review Tartt telepathically to please cut out huge sections of the book that were superfluous exhausting and unnecessary. At the sight of her I was paralyzed with happiness it was her down to the most minute detail the very pattern of her freckles she was smiling at me more beautiful and yet not older black hair and funny upward quirk of her mouth not a dream but a presence that filled the whole room a force all her own a living otherness.The section in Amsterdam made me so uneasy I had to skim to get through it. I say this as a caution to other readers This book is not a carefree or an easy read. You have been warned. Update February  It s been a year since I read The Goldfinch and every time I see a copy of this book I shudder.It is an overwhelming cauldron of pain guilt beauty loss and lust on the order of Gollums passion for the OneRing. If he looks at it too often he will become totally possessed. I thought of all the places Id been and all the places I hadnt a world lost and vast and unknowable dingy maze of cities and alleyways fardrifting ash and hostile immensities connections missed things lost and never found and my painting swept away on the powerful current and drifting out there somewhere a tiny fragment of spirit faint spark bobbing on a dark sea. Fabritius SelfPortraitThere were moments when I was so choked with emotion that the boyfriend would pass me tissues as soon as he heard a sniffle. The loss of Theo s mother his love of Hobie and Pippa the comfort of the Goldfinch the restrained desire for Boris and a few other emotional moments. These moments were poignant heavy with gorgeousness and clearly unforgettable.  was like watching an art house film by Gregg Araki mixed with reruns of Melrose Place. I know this sounds strange but this is exactly what this was like for me.When she came to New York fresh from Kansas she worked parttime as a model though she was too uneasy in front of the camera to be very good at it whatever she had it didn t translate to film. And yet she was wholly herself a rarity. I cannot recall ever seeing another person who really resembled her. She had black hair fair skin that freckled in summer chinablue eyes with a lot of light in them and in the slant of her cheekbones there was such an eccentric mixture of the tribal and the Celtic Twilight that sometimes people guessed she was Icelandic.Shed never seen a great painting in person until she was eighteen and moved to New York and she was eager to make up for lost timepure bliss perfect heaven shed said up to the neck in art books and poring over the same old slides Manet Vuillard until her vision started to blur Its crazy shed said but Id be perfectly happy if I could sit looking at the same half dozen paintings for the rest of my life. Other people have always been a little too quick to assure me that it wasn t and yes only a kid who could have known terrible accident rotten luck could have happened to anyone it s all perfectly true and I don t believe a word of it. Was she a onehit wonder? She was also hurt in the blast at the museum. In The Secret History the onepage prologue gives us a murder and a narrator who has helped to commit it..   ,raygold,cx9kci5,1,t5_2v4z0
