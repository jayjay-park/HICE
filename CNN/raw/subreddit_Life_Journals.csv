1543594,0,t1_cj98wao,Day  Today I woke up at around  because the weather was hot. Again. I quickly took out my dream journal and tried to write down what I remember. I went downstairs and ate some bread. Drank a cup of coffee because I was feeling a bit tired. I ate some noodles for lunch. In the afternoon I hung out with my cousins and did some science experiments with them. We went to a park because there was a concert at the park. We bought some subway. A very cute kid came and talk to me. She was about  so cute. Anyways we went home and watched an episode of Sherlock. School tomorrow. END.Q What do you call an illegally parked frog?Atoad,Life_Journals,cj9rhqr,1,t5_32pce

4144341,0,t1_cqthnix,Guess whos back! June nd.Sorry I havent replied in so long. I was waiting for you to reply for like a week then when you didnt I stopped logging on to reddit entirely. Afterwards I saw that you had replied but I kind of didnt want to reply back because I hadnt accomplished much in the few weeks it had been since we had talked last. But alas now I am here. Since we talked last Ive been reading more. Last Saturday I got drunk at a family function and nobody could tell except for two teenagers. That was so weird. I guess I tone myself down depending on who Im around when I drink. Also I came to the realization that those family functions are stressful. I had to get wasted to have any sort of fun. Started benching hit a personal best of  on an assisted bench yesterday. Jogging a bit more. Decided to stay here until my drivers test on June th then stay the two weeks after because my fam is leaving and Ill have the house to myself for a week and after that seriously look into moving out. I plan to be out before the year ends. Had a few dreams different from the ones I usually have.Ive decided to write a book entirely in prose. Wrote the first chaptersegmentoutline?? today. Decided Im going to get serious about becoming a writer and Ill start reading more poetry and texts that I want to influence my writings. How did finals go and what are your plans for the summer?Blessings amp love.,Life_Journals,crso7a8,2,t5_32pce
