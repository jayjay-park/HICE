10457,0,t3_1u8ex5,I would suggest that the difference in rates has nothing at all to do with fiscal policy per se. The central bank has the last word on rates. In this case the ECB. The correlation between rates and austerity here is purely a function of the ECB providing rateeasing under the condition that a country accept fiscal austerity terms and conditions.The lesson here is not that austerity or fiscal policy in general brings about lower rates. The lesson is that if the central bank sits outside your sovereign authority you can be forced to jump through any number of arbitrary hoops to access the basic lender of last resort function that monetarily sovereign nations enjoy unconditionally.,Economics,cefmiw1,10,t5_2qh1s

If you make a trade deficit systemic then you also make fiscal deficits systemic twin deficits theory and it eventually becomes unsustainable.

23448,0,t1_ceglsxz,One part that is often underestimated is the expectation of future policy component. Some say that the reason that QE has had a weak effect is that the federal reserve is expected to put on the breaks forcefully as soon as they see hints that QE might be working. They wont let inflation go much above . even if it is to catch up to longer term trends.All these excess reserves are basically expected to never make it to the real economy because as soon as the channels to do so open up the feds are expected to close another valve down the line.At least according to market monetarists QE would have worked much better and could even have been smaller in amount if it came with guarantees that the money would be allowed to flow in the economy when natural interest rates went up. That is if the central banks had said they wouldnt tighten until inflation and nominal gdp had caught up to long term trends.Banks corporations and people wouldnt be sitting on so much cash if it was expected to lose value in the coming years. Instead the money would go toward investments with value that is more intrinsic and tied to real economic activity.However instead of making the correct promises the federal reserve did the opposite such as defining unemployment thresholds that gave the message they might tighten even if inflation was still low and price levels far under trend and they set up IOER a mechanism that serves mainly to allow tightening more quickly and more aggressively when the economy shows signs of recovery.,Economics,ceh3phr,2,t5_2qh1s

We went virtually everyone being subsistence farmers because starving sucks to needing fewer and fewer people to produce enough food freeing labor up for pursuits that previously unprofitablebecause workers dead due to starvation arent very effective in producing anything.Did this happen because fewer people farmed or because technological progress allowed farmers to increase their output? Those are two different things. The only reason those exfarmers had new jobs to go to is because other technological advancements made new jobs available working in factories. But thats just coincidence. It wasnt the intent of the factory owners to employ people. If the technology had allowed them to run their factories without workers they would have.You seem to be assuming that the effect of technological advancement on labor is a constant. It isnt.

47824,0,t1_cejpsch,gtThat clearly illustrates that minimum wage in real terms peaked in s or plateaud around that year and that now the minimum is about the same level as the s in real terms...Peak is disengenous when the differences are not that major. In every decade the minimum wage has been within  of that peak and there are many years in the supposed golden age of worker protectionsworkers wages when the minimum wage is lower than it has been in the s and s.There are years when the minimum wage went down in real terms and wages still went up there are years when minimum wages went up and wages remained relatively stagnant.Because only a small percentage of workers actually get paid minimum wage or near to it its fairly obvious that larger economic forces globalization mechanization outsourcing recessions speculative bubbles would have a greater effect on overall wages than small increases and decreases in price controls that only effect a small percentage of people.gt that now the minimum is about the same level as the s in real terms... despite all the technological progress and increases in GDP per capita.Is this surprising to you?The need for low skill labor goes down as technological progress makes things more efficient and reduces the need for that labor. Minimum wage jobs are by definition the lowest skilled or rather have more people with those skills than any others.The question is not why low skill labor hasnt increased in value thats obvious if you know basic economics and have followed the trends in where all the activity in the economy has moved to away from hordes of low skill manufacturers towards small numbers of high skill specialists in areas like engineering technology finance. The real question is why more hasnt been done to increase the skills of millions of people who are left behind in that movement. In India and China the places a lot of these low skill workers are competing with there has been a tremendous increase in skills in the past  years. Millions have gone from illiterate peasant farmers to manufacturers service workers shopkeepers tech workers.When the workers in the US youre talking about still have the exact same skills they had  years ago and often less since lots of skills have become obsolete why would anyone expect their wages to rise just because other parts of the economy have done well?If you wanna talk wealth redistribution fine I support it have a negative income tax. If you want to raise wages thats a completely different question. If youre relying on minimum wage increases to raise peoples wages then youre failing those people as youre expecting them to only have skills that are only worth paying the legal minimum for.

They receive K back from the govt in tax rebates in transfers such as TANF SNAP and other forms of welfare. I know I have friends that receive significant cash transfers and tax breaks. Ive helped a few with their finances and have seen values. If those people did not receive on average K from the government they would not end up paying K in taxes which includes sales taxes and other taxes incurred spending the K in transfers.Note  says Refundable portions of tax credits are included in spending totals.From the report you linked   . As a group the bottom  percent of American families receive more back in total government spending than they pay in total taxes.  . Government tax and spending policies combine to redistribute more than  trillion from the top  percent of families to the bottom  percent.Again this is not showing what you want it to. It shows that money is taken from the rich given to the poor and they pay some tax on spending the money given to them. They are not paying K out of K in taxes. They are paying K on a larger income perhaps something like the K line labeled average income after redistribution. This is . which is reasonable given that tax rates are much lower for pretty much every category.You claimed the bottom pays  of their income in tax. How is it even possible to pay  in tax?

In theory you could have a society where the masses are very poor and nearly all production is for the consumption of the elite but history or analysis would show that this is substantially less efficient and ultimately benefits no one. Of course if the wealthy can easily take profits obtained from economic activity in one country and invest this in another such that this original country experiences a net loss of capital then it will decline. The beneficial cycle still works on a world wide scale however.Or if the economic climate is poor in the markets they can access they may also just hoard cash and bid up asset prices... but this can only work for a time. ,Economics,ceuaeki,1,t5_2qh1s

Are parents allowed to leave money to their heirs?  Should we have an inheritance tax?  If they cant leave money to their children but they can to charities why this discrepancy in their choice of how they use their money?If you have property gained via some kind of voluntary that is not taken by force interaction with others I see no issue with being able to give that property away as they see fit.It would be unjust to say that people do not have the right to manipulate the property theyve gained as they see fit.  ,Economics,cf91sbg,2,t5_2qh1s

398708,0,t1_cflzxhw,gt If there was one essential element in the work of John Maynard Keynes it was the demolition of Says Law  the assertion that supply necessarily creates demand. Keynes showed that the fact that spending equals income or equivalently that saving equals investment does not imply that theres always enough spending to fully employ the economys resources that theres always enough investment to make use of the saving the economy would have had it it were at full employment.gt First Keynes was right Says Law  the notion that income must be spent and hence that supply creates its own demand  really is at the heart of the issue. Many many people just cant see how its possible for there to be an overall shortfall of demand. The reason Ive always loved the babysitting coop story is that its a humanscale example of how demand shortfalls are possible. But my experience is that if you try telling that story to someone convinced that demand cant ever be a problem it just bounces off the minute you finish theyre back to saying that income must be spent on something so a shortage of demand can never happen and any rise in one persons spending must lead to an equal fall in someone elses spending.gt When John Maynard Keynes wrote The General Theory three generations ago he structured his argument as a refutation of what he called classical economics and in particular of Says Law the proposition that income must be spent and hence that there can never be an overall deficiency of demand. Ever since historians of thought have argued about whether this was a fair characterization of what the classical economists or at any rate his own intellectual opponents really believed.gt Marco Rubios SOTU response also included a shoutout to Says Lawgtgt Every dollar our government borrows is money that isnt being invested to create jobs. And the uncertainty created by the debt is one reason why many businesses arent hiring.For everything hes had to say on Says Law popping up in modern politics and economics ,Economics,cfm3bce,1,t5_2qh1s

You just asked what the rationale was behind US corporations not paying taxes on their entire global profits and so I gave it to you. The conventions addressing double taxation issues have a long history going back to the League of Nations in the s. Im sure someone here knows more about it than me but much of the difficulty in stopping tax evasion using offshore havens stems from the rules established to prevent the problems associated with double taxation.

Not saying those are adequate but that is the idea behind having different programs public and private. I really dont get where you are going with this anymore.

You go back saying that cash would probably be more efficient way of getting people out of poverty. But again that isnt the point of the system.But it really isnt helping the kids with the worst parents.Okay on second thought that was wrong.  What I meant was protect kids from being hungry irregardless of the situation and actions of their parents.  Food stamps do this by having a penalty financial and legal for not getting food with their cards.But further as the article indicates this really isnt how these benefits are being used.Agree the system seems to be working according to the article.The kids whose parents will currently turn  into  for drugs would still have their  for drugs and  left over. There is at least some chance that  could actually get to the kids stomach.Yes if a parent spends all  on drugs they will have non left over. But the question is does the penalties prevent the parent to not get drugs with their EBT cards and instead spend cash they got elsewhere. Since they have to buy food anyway so might was well get  dollars worth of food and spend cash gotten elsewhere on drugs.You know what I dont care anymore I thought we were having an interesting talk about EBT system we end up agreeing on pretty much everything then you tell me Im wrong. You say according to the article that system isnt being abused often then say the system should go because the people who use it for things other than food shouldnt have to be labeled criminals.Or the system should go because it doesnt help people out of poverty No one has eats their way out of poverty.

688632,0,t1_cgialyq,Totally agree. I completely see that type of logic and that side of the coin. Im not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing personally just trying to learn through the discourse.Your point explains the traditional use of HFT I agree. What I am saying is that when one exchange commonditizes your trade in a millisecond in order to allow a third party to take a piece out of your pie that seems like insider trading at worst and front running at best. My understanding of what some of these HFT do is buy your trade data millisecond before it is publicly available. I know we are dissecting a fine line here but to use your exampleThe stock trader yells to buy because the news just broke. If he is responding to publicly available data then he is making money legally. If the news is from a buddy with info that is not yet publicly available then although they might not ever get prosecuted the action is illegal.Which comes to my broader point that the market is inherently based on insider trading however you define that and that the digitization of everything has just brought that to light. People are calling a spade a spade because computers have shown everyone that this is an information game turned into a Ponzi scheme of sorts. That like you mentioned it has always been this way since the telephone telegraph boardroom and bedroom is in fact the proof in the pudding that the market is Darwinistic in a way which inevitably isnt the best for everyone. That by allowing this insider trading at any point you eliminate the hand of the market and put people in charge of pricing winners and losers stocks and bonds with a result akin to the big Austrian fear of government intervention a la socialism. Man intervenes in market man set price artificially without market influence man destroys fair market.Traditional arbitrage involves fees for services rendered. IF what the book say is true and these flash boys were not able to buy stocks that they saw available at the price marked because theses particular HFTs were buying portions of the stock to resell at a higher price in the millisecond of lag that the flash boys didnt pay for where does that lead us eventually? Everyone collocates and then what? You see the bigger pictureproblem I am trying to pose here not sure if I am being clear or not. But basically I think this should be the argument. The market is completely information based and the computers are just taking advantage of it is that good? I cant remember the name but I watched a bit on  Minutes a while back about a HF manager that was known to pay for info. Basically bribing traders and company people with gifts and such.

I dont think Martha Stewart was some criminal mastermind or financial genius.Anyways I appreciate the discussion and your thoughts.TLDR Martha Stewart. Shes no financial deviant. Everyone knows that is what builds the market and the big secret is why consumer confidence is so revered.

697377,0,t3_224xzd,I am a hospitalist physician and Chief Medical Officer for a small hospital.  Medical billing and reimbursement is notoriously complex.  For medicare it works the same for everyone.  Every service that a physician can perform be that an office visit hospital admission xray interpretation or surgery has a certain weight which is known as a Relative Value Unit RVU.  Every year Medicare establishes a conversion factor.  You take the RVU and multiply it by the conversion factor and that is what Medicare pays.  A level  office visit has an RVU weight of about ..  If the conversion factor is  then . reimbursement to the physician OR institution.  There is some regional variation in this but the rate is generally the same for all in that region more on that later.  But unlike private insurance companies there is no negotiation. Now there are several types of RVU.  Total RVU which includes the professional fee to the physician work RVU and the facility fee that the providing institution receives .  Sometimes the institution and the physician are the same thing.  Sometimes the physician is paid a salary and gets none of the RVU reimbursement  it goes completely to the institution.  The billing and reimbursement is done under the physicians name but that does not necessarily translate to what they make.Now a physician who owns hisher own clinic needs to take that money and pay their staff their overhead malpractice insurance and themselves out of it.  This type of doctor views Medicare as paying barely enough to break even...sometimes less dont get me started on medicaid.  Heshe would view disclosures like this because it makes it seem like they are earning a significant amount of money when the majority of it is paid toward overheadas a rule solosmall group overhead is around .A physician who works as employee of a system gets a regular paycheck and doesnt see any of the RVU money directly.  Many times they are paid a bonus for productivity seeing more patients means more money for the system.  These physicians see themselves as doing their job on a daily basis and taking a salary so they can worry about patient care.  Disclosing what these physicians earn would also be uncomfortable because they would feel that there would be no connection between what they earn and what they bill.  Ultimately there would be misunderstandings.So my opinion is that the more transparency and information the better.  However due to the complexity of how medical billing works this was just a general summary any information release would have to come with an explanation.  Will all this being said....sure there are docs who dont want people to know how much money they make.  But more are worried about how any of this information would be misinterpreted. edit Slight correction to a couple small errors.  Work RVUs are what the doc does.  Also Gold?  Thanks!edit Medicare is very prescriptive on what tests xrays and procedures are covered.  This is not to say that they decide what you can do its not.  Medicare technically CMS decides what they will pay for based on the diagnosis.  Example an EKG will be covered for a diagnosis of chest pain but not for headache.  If the diagnosis is not covered then the patient will be given an Advanced Beneficiary Notice ABN which must list the test the reason for the test and the cost.  If the patient signs it they are agreeing to pay for the test out of pocket.  If they do not sign it or never see one then the medical institution that performs the test eats the cost.  Annoying for the medical institutions? Yes.  Protecting patients from getting put through unnecessary tests  Absolutely.edit  There was some discussion about Why does my bill look like this?  This gets into another facet of medical billing that is crazy and ridiculous.  Usually the bills that you receive have nothing to do with how a hospital or physician gets paid.  NOTHING!  Every insurance company that a physician or hospital works with starts with a contract.  These contracts are fairly specific on how much the insurance company will pay for XYZ services.  Most of them use the same RVU system as medicare mentioned above but have a different conversion factor or change specific RVU weights.  Now due to discrimination laws hospitals and doctors MUST charge everyone the same.  They cant have different price lists depending on the insurance.  Now any insurance company would be happy to pay less than what their contract says.  So the hospitals and doctors make their price list to be slightly above the most lucrative contract they have.  Then when a bill is sent out to an insurance that pays less the hospital or physician considers this a contractual discount or adjustment.  Even if you are still in your deductible you still get the benefit of this discount.  Your personal responsibility then depends on the terms of your insurance.  You may say to yourself what about people without insurance?  Exactly.  Most hospitals and clinics including mine can charge less based on income but that doesnt cover everyone.  ,Economics,cgjjlii,180,t5_2qh1s

Just think why total net debt the money supply increases . a year. As does the stock market and real estate. Wow this is the same percentage your pension fund expects to make each year.  So the money supply increases . a year and your wages go up lt a year. Please take a moment to graph that out over the last  years if you dont intuitively understand what that means. That is wealth concentrating to the owners.  That is why the government encourages you to own stocks or homes  its the only way to attempt to keep up with inflation.  This is why the government handed out checks to minorities who said they couldnt get farm loans  being denied a loan prevents your from participating in the creation of money which basically relegates you to poverty.Capitalism requires the government to do its job of protecting the people.  Courts cops and regulations were all developed due to capitalism as ways to protect peoples private property.

719123,0,t1_cglt3md,gtWhy not use the firms natural discount rate? Choosing any other discount rate requires stronger assumptions about why the firms discount rate is biased. Leaving the market free requires less assumptions and thus is less prone to center planner hubris.Because society might believe it better to allocate natural resources intertemporally according to some discount rate that differs from firms discount rate. I see not reason why firms discount rate is more necessarily appropriate or more desirable that some alternative discount rate. There is no discount rate that is correct so saying that we should use firms discount rate is a normative judgment whether or not it requires less assumptions. Defining correct in this context is a normative judgment. One could always counter that choosing to use firms discount rate rather than say a discount rate decided on via a democratic is itself hubristic. I agree with your presumption but I do not pretend that I am not making a normative judgment.gtCompetitive markets make no normative judgments. Markets are neutral. Topdown policy on the other hand must make some normative judgments.I do not disagree that choosing a social discount rate is a normative judgment but as I said above choose firms discount rate is also a normative judgment. I sympathize with the desire to arrive at a positive way to allocate natural resources intertemporally but I do not believe that such a mechanism exists. You might prefer a less centralized way of allocating natural resources intertemporally as I do but that preferences is a normative judgment. You should own up to that normative judgment and argue why it is superior to possible alternative defining what superior means to you rather than hiding behind the assertion that you are making a positive claim. Choosing any particular system to allocating natural resources intertemporally is a normative judgment this choice depends on what you believe the aim of a such a system is. gtThe magnitude of these externalities is disputable but can always be remedied by a simple tax. But thats a completely different issue than the issue of concern for future generation resource consumption.A agree that a Pigovian tax would remedied the problem of externalities assuming you could ascertain the correct size of the tax required. However the existence of externalities is absolutely relevant because absent a appropriately sized Pigovian tax the existence of such externalities invalidates the Pareto optimality of a competitive equilibrium intertemporal allocation of natural resources. ,Economics,cgm0nh5,1,t5_2qh1s

843653,0,t3_23rsbv,Privatization is a bad word because it is used for things it doesnt mean.Privatizing a public monopoly is usually ends in a private monopoly.  Private monopolies are always worse than public monopolies.Imagine if Chicago had privatized its meters off to a bunch of separate groups.  Would that have been better?  Maybe but only if there was a clause in the contracts that the contract would immediately end if any sort of consolidation occurred.  When a market is inelastic actors in that market will attempt to create a monopoly.  And the parking meters in a city is a pretty inelastic market.  Even if the meters had been leased out to different companies one or more would try to buy out the contracts or the companies holding them to create a monopoly.  So you get to the same place.Look at the diamond market.  For every diamond for sale there are thousands kept out of circulation to prop up the price.

846693,0,t1_ch0i4ua,I am  certain that we dont have the sign wrong  it is difficult but not impossible! to think that every monetary economist from Hume to Irving Fisher to Friedman to Woodford is committing a sign error. The Fisher relation is real its a noarbitrage condition but the dynamics around it are pinned down by other aspects of your model.  Analogously the demand curve is real but the dynamics around it are pinned down by whether or not its shifting by the shape of the supply curve and the institutional details of your model.For example if we say that irinfl and we suppose i falls then it does not follow immediately that inflation falls indeed wed expect inflation and output to rise. The story is from macro  decrease in nominal rates will lead real rates to fall due to price stickiness which leads households to consume more today which boosts output and inflation today. Expansionary monetary policy ought to be expansionary. Williamson is saying that expansionary monetary policy is contractionary at least in the long run?. Kocherlakota said that too in the speech mentioned but he came to his senses later.My initial thoughts are fourfold . I am about  sure that QE is not deflationary to a first order unless there is something awkward going on with the expectations. Say we do QE but not enough of it so market participants think that the future output path will be lower than they previously thought so AD contracts. Then QE is deflationary but only because the relevant object QE  QEexpected is negative. Or suppose QE is a signal of expected future policy and weak QE is a signal of weak expected future policy so AD contracts. But neither of these are the mechanism Williamson describes.. I also think theres some trickery going on here with outofequilibrium dynamics stability and the error of reasoning from a single equation in a multiequation system.. I think that by focusing narrowly on interest rates were missing bigger pieces of the monetary transmission mechanism that are important to the matter at hand. . Itd be very interesting if the details of the fiscal policy reaction function mattered for the answer to this question.However thank God that Williamson is a proper economist and hes written down a model of his idea so we can actually talk about his idea like sensible adults. He also has this simpler model that needs to be addressed. Too many people have these neat insurgent ideas but dont bother to write them down in a model COUGH secular stagnation COUGH.Those are all preliminary conjectures. Ill have to work out the math before saying something definitive. Its times like these that I wish we had a benchmark monetary policy model in which the Feds basic tool was its balance sheet so we could have a common framework for thinking about these issues.

857699,0,t3_23y650,While I definitely agree that there is issues with comparing labour standards in developing country manufacturing with counterparts in developed countries and that the media does sensationalize Foxconn in terms of its conditions there is a problem with using a very low baseline and then concluding that Foxconns working conditions are acceptable since they are an improvement over rural farm life in China.It becomes a race to the bottom then  as long as you can provide marginally better conditions than rural farm life does that make those marginally better conditions which could be considered inhumanedegrading acceptable?For example a lot of poor farmers in India facing suicide because of crop failures chose to immigrate to the Middle East and gain construction positions. There are widespread concerns about them being paid no wages floggedbeaten for small offences having their passports confiscated and housed in small dorm rooms in terrible conditions. Yet they are technically surviving since they are provided food and are allowed to live. Marginally compared to suicide they are doing better. Does that justify those conditions? Probably not.In the short run to escape from the poverty cycle in rural China jobs in companies like Foxconn are great in boosting employment providing housingfood and even perhaps some savings. But this is a short term gain using the very lowest baseline to show variance and thus prove development. Once you are breaking out of the poverty cycle the comparator baseline must change in order to show that these workers do deserve better.However given the abundance of cheap labour still at the lower baseline not only in China but other Asian and African countries it is unlikely that the baseline working conditions will be raised.,Economics,ch1rx9j,6,t5_2qh1s

858783,0,t1_ch1trim,Im not assuming this is just the truth. Their grandparents lived in a time when  of the population was rural. They labored in rice fields soaked in human feces for  hours a day to maximize the output of their crop. When they do get back home they spend their time making various things for themselves and others to savemake some more money. They have primitive hygienic facilities and they have rudimentary access to healthcare. They dont own the land they work on and for a long time the government had unstable policies that would confiscate varying amounts of their crops every year. During the Great Leap Forward the government confiscated so much of their crops that some  million of them starved to death or were never born due to delayed birth. Their income and consumption grew at a fraction of the pace of urban workers since their civil war.Being a peasant was a terrible life. Working in a Foxxcon factory is a huge step up from the backbreaking life of the peasant. At the very least you arent soaked up to your ankle in feces and you have better access to healthcare than a peasant does. The work is monotonous but assembling electronics all day is far less demanding and damaging than bending over tending to crops all day and being exposed to various weather conditions. Foxxcon employees also earn far more than their rural counterparts.I mean really this should be common sense. If working in the fields is better than working at Foxxcon they would have never left the fields. If an other alternative was better then they would take the alternatives. There are labor distortions in China but the distortion is in the form of policies that keep the peasants on their fields instead of allowing them to migrate to urban areas.,Economics,ch1wcy2,4,t5_2qh1s

I guess thats okay though I dont see why the discussion shouldnt be expanded to include everyone affected. Thats the only way well get an idea of what is going to happen to the larger economy.gt Im saying that it will likely lead to job losses for lowskilled and uneducated workers.Thats overall what my point was about.  I did mix up what you said about the law of demand though so my bad  I suppose now that you meant the supply and demand of workers not productsservices.  I thought you meant the increase in productservice prices would lead to less sales for businesses and that would lead to job loss.  So would the increased price of workers lead to job loss?  I dont think it will because with the bottom of the economy having more money to spend theyre going to buy more from businesses increasing their profits.  Because of the increase in sales businesses will need to hire more people than before.  Actually the recession recovery weve been having has been so slow because too many people have not enough money to spend.  Thats not just for people at the bottom of the economy though but for most people because wages have dropped or stagnated for years and years.Heres a realworld example of a minimum wage increase creating jobsNew Jersey voters in November approved increasing the minimum wage by  an hour to . tying future increases to the consumer price index. In January after the raise took effect private employers added  jobs in New Jersey Its hard to find but supposedly when Clinton raised the federal minimum wage job growth increased as well.

879285,0,t1_ch47qok,. Not really. Gold standard simply means that gold is the currency i.e. money is gold. Your dollar bill is simply a claim to moneygold. Credits are hence claims to gold as well if we trust the central bank to fulfill the money to gold part. We have a fiat system. In a fiat system your dollar bill is money. It is a good among others. Credit is hence a claim on money on getting some cash dollars out of your bank if you want to.. And the costs will determine trade offs but they are not the only way. As stated above Central bank credits are money. Its like a deposit. Banks lend the money from the central bank and give the central bank claims to that money. That doesnt mean that credit isnt demand induced and that there is no ceiling. Again the ceiling is determined by the considerations of the bank how much money they need to keep if they give out credits. Of course the cheaper the interests they have to pay to the central bank the cheaper will be interests on credits the bigger should be demand in theory. But it is also dependent on other factors. How trustable is the debitor in paying back the money. Etc.. But that doesnt mean that banks can create money at will. They can only create credit money. And it is limited by the risk of default and not being able to pay back claims to money.If you think about these questions you should always ask yourself why is this and that the case and if something doesnt make sense dont brush it aside but rethink your assumptions. For example why would banks need collateral if they were to print unlimited money? Why would they not print unlimited money? Why would they care if someone defaults or not. No it doesnT explain the point. What explains the point is that Germany had a history of currency reforms. The ECB system is far more compe than anythin like earning and borrowing them. ECB operations function in a decentralized way where money is then disperesed by the central banks of the countries.

Even in Germany where workers of skilled jobs like barbers can work full time and still receive money from the government.  They would rather work though because it is unattractive to not work and mooch.  People want to higher their selfworth in society and enough of that comes from providing for yourself that people choose to work instead of not working.

It was like they became daytraders and lost it all in the market. A lot of people did a short sale which destroyed their credit lost an investment that could have eventually recovered and basically provided a shortterm fix that was psychologically gratifying.

1035055,0,t1_chlwein,gt A Note from Paul Solman Larry Kotlikoff is a regular here on Making Sene especially with his Ask Larry Social Security column on Mondays.gt gt Friday he takes on the subject weve been exploring all week the inequality thesis of French economist Thomas Piketty. Larry is no fan as he makes clear.gt gt I have just one point to make before he takes the floor a point Piketty made when I asked him if one has to buy the theoretical crux of this thesis and book  that the return to capital is and will continue to outpace economic growth  in order to worry about rising inequality.gt gt Paul Solman Do we need to believe your story about inequality being a function of the high return on capital compared to a low growth of the economy in order to think that we ought to be doing something about inequality? Regardless of why its happening?gt gt Thomas Piketty If the top is rising three times faster than the average whatever the reason for this in the long run this is a problem. Where will this stop? Nobody knows and theres no natural force that guarantees that this will stop somewhere that is acceptable and compatible with our democratic institutions. So I think there is a lot of evidence that the key force is the rate of return to capital rising faster than the growth rate. But even if some other combination of forces was to explain inequality the point is that you dont want the top and the middle to completely diverge and evolve at completely different rates in the long run.gt gt With that out of the way heres Larrys critique. Watch my interview with Piketty at the bottom of this post.gt gt Extreme private wealth inequality is a fact of economic life in most countries. The U.S. is a prime example. The top  percent of wealth holders own almost  percent of all wealth. And the top  percent hold almost  percent.gt gt What should we make of this?gt gt Thomas Pikettys new book Capital in the TwentyFirst Century claims that everrising wealth inequality is an inevitable feature of capitalism. His argument? The growth of wealth is set by its rate of return denoted by the symbol r which is much higher than the growth rate of wages denoted by the symbol g. Thus capitalists become more and more dominant over those who own nothing but their labor inviting terrifying consequences. Or as Marx put it capitalism carries the seeds of its own destruction.gt gt Marxs solution was Abolish all private property. Pikettys answer is twofold. First tax large wealth holdings at up to  percent per year so that they disappear albeit gradually.gt gt And second dont trust economists mathematical models. The statement r gt g r exceeds g is the only math needed  that plus the data.gt gt We cant rely on Pikettys analysis and numbers as a cure for capitalism. His theory is deeply flawed his private wealth data are highly misleading and his policy prescription is over the top. His book may set back public understanding of resource inequality for years to come.gt gt Pikettys r gt g economic law of everrising wealth inequality would make a good Disney cartoon. Picture Scrooge McDuck and his nephew Donald stuck on an island. Each day two bags of corn drop from the sky. Donald eats his corn as it lands. Scrooge eats nothing. Instead he plants every kernel gets a big yield of new corn and stacks this output in an evertaller pile.gt gt But Scrooge hates working. So he pays Donald a kernel a day to plant and stack. Scrooge now perched high atop his growing mountain gets richer and richer thanks to r the return on his investment. Donalds wealth gets smaller and smaller from Scrooges dominant everrising perspective.gt gt Now Donald realizes he should save just like his uncle. But he cant. His wages are fixed because overall economic growth  g  is zero. And he needs all the calories he can get to fuel is ability to work. As a result he never has a kernel to his name. Eventually Donald realizes his oppression and walks off the job  leaving Scrooge stuck skyhigh and squawking. The weathers changed  from warm to frigid.gt gt The real world is much different from this caricature however. In the U.S. the two richest people are Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Most of their fortunes are going to the Gates Foundation whose main mission is eliminating disease in the developing world  perhaps the greatest cause of global poverty and inequality.gt gt Neither Gates nor Buffett came from big money. And even were they instead to leave all their wealth to their children it would over time become dispersed as their descendants multiply marry down get divorced mismanage their money pay taxes donate pursue lives of leisure lose their jobs live longer than expected incur major medical expenses lose big at Black Jack and so on. As the saying went in th century England Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.gt gt But the main reason why wealth distributions stabilize in all realistic r gt g economic models is that the rich like the poor spend money. Becoming rich doesnt suddenly transform us let alone all our heirs into Scrooge McDucks with spending propensities that are below average let alone zero.gt gt One quick glance at the massive yachts docked or the private jets parked in Nantucket Massachusetts or other playgrounds of the rich makes this plain. And without this assumption  that heirs are permanently transformed into nonspending Scrooges  all r gt g economies end up with stable wealth distributions.gt gt This doesnt mean bequests vanish. It means that as a group those who inherit spend the excess of r over g earned on their inherited wealth. This keeps wealth holdings from becoming ever more skewed.gt gt The math here isnt that tough and takes us a long way. Computer modeling helps us see that Pikettys theory is at odds with actual theory. See for example this paper. So does a glance at Forbes list of the  wealthiest Americans. Sixty percent of the people listed in  werent on the list in . And nearly a quarter of those listed in  werent listed in . This is the future devouring the past not the past devouring the future which is Pikettys version of the rich getting richer.gt gt Moreover Pikettys supposed law of growing private wealth inequality is refuted by U.S. data which shows if anything higher wealth inequality in the early part of the last century than prevails today. Piketty says shocks  the Great Depression the New Deal and World War II  temporarily interrupted the force of r gt g. But g gt r events arent all that rare. Remember ? Proclaiming a law and then saying it hasnt worked for over a century because it only works when it works isnt serious scholarship.gt gt Moreover all reasonable economic models in which wealth keeps rising relative to the supply of labor will produce an eversmaller value of r as capital becomes ever more abundant compared to labor and competes for evershrinking investment opportunities relative to the value of labor. Thus even if Piketty were right hed be wrong. Past wealth accumulation would devour future wealth accumulation.gt gt Another inconvenient truth for Pikettys thesis is that the ratio of total inheritances to total net worth has dropped by one third over the last two decades. This finding comes care of New York Universitys Edward Wolff and the Bureau of Labor Statistics Maury Gittleman. Their careful study of Federal Reserve survey data also shows that inheritances and other wealth transfers tend to be equalizing in terms of the distribution of household wealth.gt gt How can that be? One answer is that the parents of the poor die at earlier ages than parents of the rich and arent therefore able to spend down as much of their wealth before they die and bequeath it.gt gt But the biggest empirical problem with Pikettys work is relying on private wealth data to measure wealth inequality. In so doing he leaves out much if not most of the total wealth of poor and middleclass households  their claims to future Social Security Medicare and Medicaid benefits or their equivalent in other countries. See Pauls story with economist Bob Lerman on this very point. The fact that households acquired these assets by saving through the government doesnt justify excluding them in analyzing total wealth inequality. Were Piketty to include them he might find declining wealth inequality in recent decades.gt gt The deep flaws in parts of Pikettys book dont mean that inequality is either small or benign. But the real source of inequality these days is not due to capitalists saving every penny and workers spending every cent or to r always exceeding g. Its due to labor earnings becoming ever more skewed. This is happening for a variety of reasons including the advent of smart machines. This rising wage inequality which Berkeleys Emmanual Saez and coauthor Piketty have spent years carefully documenting doesnt pit capitalists against workers. It pits workers against workers.gt gt Paul Solman interviewed Piketty about his thesis and the success of his book on the NewsHour.,Economics,chlxvh4,5,t5_2qh1s

The rules of the game may call for marking scores down as well as up but in no sense is there a need to collect points as revenue.Taxes serve a purpose as inflation control to drive demand for the currency to encourage or discourage particular activities. The issuer does need to tax but not for revenue.gt And if we were to repay the debt that way e.g. through taxation of our citizens would that have different effects on the economy than the method youre describing?It would definitely have effects.

1286077,0,t1_cie9wsh,gtYou contend that aircraft manufacture is a natural monopoly and that the state ensures efficiency of that market. Im asking for evidence such as quotas.Where did I contend this? My argument is that natural monopolies exist  because of economies of scale and  offer an efficient market situation as competitors in economies of scale tend to decrease overall welfare due to the fact that the high capital required to enter the market reduces possible consumer surplus as two competitors would have to increase prices to maximize profits  the high fixed cost to entry will be passed on to the consumer.gtThe entire open source movement in software and todays music has gotten better and better even though copyright is effectively unenforceable.But these arent instances where there is a huge fixed cost to entry  software design is something someone can do who has simply learned the skills needed and music is well music and can be produced with far less fixed costs especially now when you dont need an expensive studio to accomplish  of what is done  I know this first hand as I have done a lot of music production just on my laptop and with a  keyboard.Im not arguing about monopolies as a whole but natural monopolies and those have certain criteria  the biggest one being economy of scale and huge fixed costs of entry into a market. Monopolies otherwise are unhealthy for an economy there is probably an exception out there but I am not sure of what it would be so I wont try and argue that. Im not even sure I would as it seems monopolies outside of natural monopolies dont provide increased welfare for anyone but the monopolist.As for the IP stance I am fully for crowd and opensourced projects but not in the case of economies of scale andor in the case of certain industries that require large investments of capital to create innovative products. In industries with low entrance or RampD costs software is an excellent example open source often is far more useful than IP methods of producing content. My argument is simply that some industries require huge costs to innovate think an oil company doing exploratory drilling  they require some incentive to do this if they cant capture profits safely from their efforts otherwise they wont explore new areas and should be awarded a temporary monopoly to cover their costs. This is not to be confused with a natural monopoly as the IPguaranteed returns would have to be imposed by an outside body i.e. government or what have you.,Economics,cieat4m,0,t5_2qh1s

This will charge fossil fuels properly for the costs to the damage to the environment while encouraging green energy without picking winners.  The proceeds from the carbon tax can be given equally to every American taxpayer in compensation for the higher energy prices they will cause.

The issue I have is that I dont see what that trigger is so I have a hard time believing the FED wont save us.IF inflation continues to rise in theory due to increased economic activity bond rates will rise as well.  Money will probably leave the stock market and go into bonds to find their safer yields...probably in an orderly fashion too.  But an increasing economy would be good for stocks too. On the other hand higher bond rates may put a strain on the economys ability to grow.  EPS may also not rise anymore as free debtliquidity dries up and companies can no longer buy back their own stock.  Most of the growth Im seeing in EPS lately is a result of stock buybacks with free money not growing revenuescompanies.So if the stock market does collapse due to lack of liquidity...bond rates will fall too and there obviously would be some deflationary pressures return to USD.   I believe the fed will come to our rescue again with more QE.  Stocks will be juiced bond rates will fall further and deflation will be combated again.  What Im hoping someone could answer for me is What would be the reason the fed wouldnt be able to do more QE to save the stock market and us from deflation?  Political pressures strongly point to more QE. Interestingly Im watching whats going on in Japan. The QE there has had less than desirable results lately and Im seeing some funny things going on there with their economy.

Modern control theory of article  Control theory sfw gtIn contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory modern control theory utilizes the timedomain state space representation a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input output and state variables related by firstorder differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs outputs and states the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear. The state space representation also known as the timedomain approach provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach the use of the state space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. State space refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a vector within that space. gtInteresting Cybernetics | Social control theory | Control theory sociology | Controller control theory Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcjv oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecjv.

1815386,0,t1_ck7xepg,OK I appreciate your answer and encouragement of studying demand deposits. But I asked about what contemporary economists thought about demand deposits. And it seems like you said that they dont consider them important enough to include by default in their models.BTW the KyotakiMoore model does not model demand deposits and uses the loanable funds hypothesis in a two sector model without banks.The same goes for the Gertler model pg gtThe core framework is the monetary DSGE model... To this we add financial intermediaries that transfer funds between households and nonfinancial firms.This is also the loanable funds hypothesis. Karadi seems to mostly publish with Gertler so Ill lump Karadi in with him unless you can show me a unique Karadi Model.This paper by Jerman and Quadrini seems the furthest along albeit it was published after the GFC. But it still only uses a two sector model with households and firms see pg . If there is no banking sector then the way demand deposits are issued cannot be modeled. This paper still relies on a loanable funds hypothesis.So I ask you do contemporary mainstream economists not believe that demand deposits are a consequential piece of our economy?Judging by the authors you invoked I have to assume that the answer is yes which is a troubling idea when considering the validity of their models.edit a few typos,Economics,ck7xptr,3,t5_2qh1s

1884671,0,t1_ckgamsz,ampampamp Capitalism sfw gtgtCapitalism is an economic system in which trade industry and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for profit   Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation competitive markets and wage labour  In a capitalist economy the parties to a transaction typically determine the prices at which assets goods and services are exchanged gtThe degree of competition role of intervention and regulation and scope of public ownership varies across different models of capitalism.  Economists political economists and historians have taken different perspectives in their analysis of capitalism and recognized various forms of it in practice. These include laissezfaire capitalism welfare capitalism crony capitalism and state capitalism each highlighting varying degrees of dependency on markets public ownership and inclusion of social policies The extent to which different markets are free as well as the rules defining private property is a matter of politics and policy Many states have what are termed capitalist mixed economies referring to a mix between planned and marketdriven elements.  Capitalism has existed under many forms of government in many different times places and cultures.  Following the demise of feudalism capitalism became the dominant economic system in the Western worldgtCapitalism was carried across the world by broader processes of globalization such as imperialism and by the end of the nineteenth century became the dominant global economic system in turn intensifying processes of economic and other globalization.  Later in the th century capitalism overcame a challenge by centrallyplanned economies and is now the encompassing system worldwide   with the mixed economy being its dominant form in the industrialized Western world. Barry Gills and Paul James writegtDifferent economic perspectives emphasize specific elements of capitalism in their preferred definition. Laissezfaire and liberal economists emphasize the degree to which government does not have control over markets and the importance of property rights   Neoclassical and Keynesian macroeconomists emphasize the need for government regulation to prevent monopolies and to soften the effects of the boom and bust cycle.  Marxian economists emphasize the role of capital accumulation exploitation and wage labor Most political economists emphasize private property as well in addition to power relations wage labor class and the uniqueness of capitalism as a historical formation. gtProponents of capitalism argue that it creates more prosperity than any other economic system and that its benefits are mainly to the ordinary person.  Critics of capitalism variously associate it with economic instability  an inability to provide for the wellbeing of all people  and an unsustainable danger to the natural environment.  Socialists maintain that although capitalism is superior to all previously existing economic systems such as feudalism or slavery the contradiction between class interests will only be resolved by advancing into a completely social system of production and distribution in which all persons have an equal relationship to the means of production. gtThe term capitalism in its modern sense is often attributed to Karl Marx   In his magnum opus Capital Marx analysed the capitalist mode of production using a method of understanding today known as Marxism However Marx himself rarely used the term capitalism while it was used twice in the more political interpretations of his work primarily authored by his collaborator Friedrich Engels In the th century defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term capitalism with phrases such as free enterprise and private enterprise and replaced capitalist with rentier and investor in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism. gtgtImage iInteresting Anticapitalism | Criticism of capitalism | Crony capitalism | History of capitalism Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckgano oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckgano.

2003098,0,t1_ckuia94,How do you define what benefits government? I think its actually a tricky question to answer. With private firms it seems pretty easy because theyve got a bottom line but a government is not structured like a business and doesnt have the same incentives. Theres no board room making coordinated efforts that owns company stock. There are several factions with competing interests. But lets just say as you seem to imply that the IPCC benefits from taxes. Wouldnt this only be true if the revenue from the taxes went back to the IPCC? Of the  authors involved in AR WGIII Ch.  the only author I see who was involved in both AR WGIII Ch  and AR WGIII is Taishi Sugiyama who works for a nonprofit in Japan not the government. Theres no stock in the IPCC that could be bought low and sold high if governments profit that any of the authors could possibly own. gtFor example claiming fuel taxes in the long run caused lower emissions something claimed in that report you linked when over a prolonged period of time transportation has also become more fuel efficient. The question would be if fuel consumption changed.Im not sure if youre trying to be deliberately deceptive or you just honestly missed the information youre requesting but the report clearly states ...in the longrun  higher fuel prices correlate with  reduction in fuel use and emissions. If you want the details you have to read the full report. Its hardly fair to complain that the summary isnt detailed enough I linked both. gtFurther your report does not have high confidence for cap and trades effectiveness...Ive never claimed capandtrade was effective so thats a bit of a strawman dont you think? I strongly prefer carbon taxes over capandtrade for exactly that reason. That said the evidence for the limited effectiveness of capandtrade is not very high and might still be better than nothing.gt...and does not expound much on the degree of effectiveness of carbon taxes...The numbers are clearly stated. I posted those for transportation fuels above.gt...but merely their political feasability....by demonstrating that theyve been done before and have been effective where theyve been employed? Thats obviously more than political feasibility. You can also look outside of government to find support for carbon taxes. Harvard economist Greg Mankiw for example has long been advocating for revenueneutral carbon taxes. University of Chicago economist Gary Becker has also voiced support for carbon taxes. Cornells Antonio Bento and Robert Frank argue for carbon taxes not only for sustainability but also for economic recovery and deficit reduction. Harvards Ken Rogoff is yet another Interestingly James Hansen one of the most outspoken and wellknown climatologists specifically advocates for a revenueneutral carbon tax meaning the government doesnt actually raise revenue from taxing carbon pollution. This means there would be no extra money for government research or other secret motives Hansen might have for raising the alarm on climate change. Interestingly if a revenueneutral carbon tax hurts the economy which the evidence doesnt support the government actually collects less revenue. gtWhat is the metric for the IPCC in concluding success?According to the reportgt Appropriate criteria for assessing these instruments include economic efficiency cost effectiveness distributional impact and institutional political and administrative feasibility Section .The last  pages are all references so you can do your own analysis if youre not happy with the IPCCs. ,Economics,ckuklso,1,t5_2qh1s

I dont consider myself a layman although I certainly dont consider myself an expert eitherIm totally a layman in geopolitics and other things thoughAs a chemical engineering student or a premed youre a layman when it comes to climate change or economics just Im a layman in these fields as a neuroscientist. However you may find the IPCC reports more at your level. The IPCC doesnt actually pay its contributing authors its all done on a voluntary basis. You should be able to follow the references when you have more questions. If you are a student at a university you should have access to the primary literature through your universitys library including all the Nature articles I linked. You should have learned how to access the primary literature as a premed. Go to your universitys library website and look for a link to PubMed or Web of Science. Web of Science is nice because you can do forward as well as backward searches in addition to citation analyses. PubMed will show you related citations for individual articles to the right of your article. Its important when evaluating a research article to look not just at the article youre reading but on the literature that it builds off of. You can also use the forward search tools in Web of Science to see how particular articles have been received in the literature many findings are often overturned but those that are replicated and built off in a sturdy way are more reliable particular the more examinations they hold up to. I also feel obligated to point out to you that as a layman you will lack the interactional expertise needed to really examine this material critically.

My objection would be why continue using a model which clearly has some flaws about human action instead of trying to use new models to incorporate these new insights. It took a long time before these thoughts were incorporated and some of them still arent because they are being ignored or ridiculed based on authoritative arguments.You are right social science is also entangled with politics this is why alot of sociological research is such crap.

That is putting a high marginal tax on the rich discourages very high income as they dont get to keep as much of it. This means that a country like Sweden with the second highest top marginal tax rate may actually reduce its income inequality by having higher marginal tax rates. Of course that means that it will collect less tax revenue from the very rich because they have less money.That Martin and HertelFernandez article was so naive in terms of the causes and consequences of tax programs.

The defenders of those in the higher brackets of that system are annoyed that this system isnt also used to assign organs to and from people so that those individuals must for once be treated equally to all others. They are irked that a privilege of life is not recognised for those people based on their concrete circumstances at the expense of those in worst circumstances. They are enraged that civilised society doesnt allow them to use their wealth to buy pieces of other people for their benefit.This is it. You are arguing that the rich should live longer at the expense of the poor. That there is no right to life and no inherent dignity for any person other than the rights and dignity that can be bought by cash and expropriated by poverty.Youre not tired of seeing people die. Youre tired of seeing the people that have the money to buy a piece of the desperate poor being treated just like those desperate poor when it really matters. Youre tired of seeing those people die because you know that if only the system didnt treat them as equals if only they were allowed to use their wealth to buy another person they could substitute him in their position instead of waiting as everyone else and risking to die on the same terms as everyone else. This is literally the only thing that changes the distribution of organs and life conforms to the distribution of income. The rich can get one faster and more surely the poor still rely on donors and a normal waiting list and the desperate poor are generously allowed to sell themselves piece by piece.That you would state the sentence while people walk around with organs they dont need is surreally disgusting you clearly know that people very much need their organs that they would only sell them if they were really desperate. What you are really saying is that they dont deserve their organs because of their circumstances at least not as much as those in better circumstances.I will control my moral disgust to say that if you actually cared at all about the life of people you would not be trying to justify a system where your prefered living can live more at the proportional expense of the rest because thats the most you can do by shuffling organs around based on income distribution no one can get something someone isnt losing only the conditions of this event change you would simply be arguing for routinely harvesting the organs of the dead which would immediately dissolve this problem without being an affront to the dignity of human beings.But finally yes I would much rather people die when their time comes than to establish this ridiculous scheme of postmodern vampyrism where the new aristocracy gets to live a little more by consuming the desperate. ,Economics,clngdm0,4,t5_2qh1s

Obviously we who are against violent exploitation dont mean personal use to include just a few seconds of use.  Were talking about long term personal use.  gt selling to others on an agreed upon arrangementSelling something is irrelevant.  It has nothing to do with whether a form of violenceproperty is exploitative or nonexploitative.Again its exploitation to  violently deprive others of land which includes its natural resources unless they surrender part of their production to their attacker.  Those are natural amp preexisting things of value.Example Imagine there was a city near a river and one day the people yet again were out of water.   So they went to the river just to find a gunman who claimed he owned the river.    The man built a dam  modified the river amp so on.  Despite how the public didnt want any of that.    He demanded payment for access to the waterriver which he claimed he owned.      That is parasitic violent exploitation not personal use of the water.    And many pseudolibertarians would claim its private property.  Theyd claim he modified the river therefore its his.  Or other utter nonsense.    All that is is an irrational subjective opinion to attempt to justify violent parasitic forms of property.In normal life we have a similar issue with land amp its natural resources.

2377154,0,t1_cm5gpdw,gt Yes we call those people capitalists. They start with a pile of money seek profitable opportunities for Investment spending through which they can capture consumption dollars as profit ending with a bigger pile of money. When the system works well the middle part of that sequence is productive real output contributing to prosperity and standards of living.As I said money merely facilitates exchange. A bigger pile of money doesnt say much not unless you measure it against the available goods and services within the economy. All economies are production based that is what makes consumption possible. You understand this yet you somehow think that the introduction of money somehow changes things when money is worthless if it cant be exchanged for something that someone has produced. Introducing money merely makes it easier for people to forgo consumption to save to enable investments and production in the future. gtWhat youre not accounting for is that the opportunities in that middle portion derive from consumers with purchasing power. Aggregate demand. Thats where the dollars to be captured as profit come from. When theres a shortfall in that demand the opportunities for profitable investment dry up.Yes so the introduction of monetary stimulus boosts aggregate demand bidding up prices preventing prices from falling creating an illusion of wealth and inflating bubbles. gtThen the process breaks down and you see capitalists sitting on their piles of money or playing casino with it bidding up the prices of existing assets. Anything but Investment spending because the demand isnt there. Even though the capitalists still desire to engage in productive activity for profit... they cant do so without demand.Sitting on piles of money that were accumulated during times of false prosperity. And they dont just sit on piles of money. They have it invested they have it in bonds they have it spread around chasing returns or they save it due to any number of factors that leave them uncertain of the future. If Keynesians had it their way companies would just spent it on expanding their business giving employees raises and bidding up prices.

But the bidders do not put up collateral the Fed does since reverse repos are liabilities for them they use Treasury securities as collateral. This is a part of their plan to decrease liquidity. Theyve been messing around with reverse repos since late  i.e. the financial crisis. Repos were the main financial instrument behind the crash. The repos were not renewed by investors meaning wholesale funding was pulled out from the financial institutionsshadow banks which is functionally the same as a bank run.

We know that these things affect income. Furthermore its likely that parents teach their children things that make them more likely to be successful.People claim that the success of the children of successful parents prove that we dont live in a meritocracy but that only makes sense if you assume that merit is nonheritable. Since merit is largely heritable a correlation between parental income and child income is entirely consistent with meritocracy.Indeed if there were no such correlation this would almost certainly be a symptom of something horribly wrong.

Riiight thats why business is increasing salaries every  months just so people can keep their purchasing power. I go there for work once a month and the situation is much more miserable than any journalist could paint it and every single bit of it is the result of economic mismanagement corruption and a gross and very base desire for power. Its a dictatorship in every sense of the word and its a fucking nightmare. It is fucking godawful and its heartbreaking.In short having seen Venezuelas decline with my own eyes over time working with people that live there going to courts there and dealing with the government and socalled justice system there I can tell you that one dude perhaps being more interested in reporting something that could lead to the downfall of the Maduro government is the least of anyones worries. Maduro and his cronies are criminals gangsters dictators terrorists and gross violators of Fundamental Human Rights and theres nothing worse than the token armchair ideologue to sit back and spout bullshit statistics that are apparently official about improvements to education healthcare or the poverty level without ever having gone to see the disgusting condition of the country with their own eyes. Were talking about a country with a hour propaganda channel about how great things are there. In the event that this one particular journalist was biased it still doesnt even come close to the level of propaganda that is disguised as an unbiased an official source that does make it out. That machine is much bigger and much more powerful than this one guy. To give you an idea multinationals with branches in Venezuela usually work with their own calculations of macroeconomic indicators because anything governmentrelated is rubbish and lies.Also careful about claiming people are trying to overthrow governments. He may be actively campaigning against them but rest assured if he were trying to overthrow i.e cause a coup detat as you claim or anything even remotely close to it hed be in jail with Lpez and the national channel would also proudly be reporting that their prison guards were mixing their faeces in with his food.Anyway Maduro doesnt have the charm brains or bank that Chvez did.

3023245,0,t1_cob6xe2,Exactly.  You would only buy negative yield bonds if you expected the price of the bonds to increase.  In a market made up of rational selfinterested private actors a negative yield bonds price would never increase because people would make more money over the bonds life in real terms by taking the money they would have spent on the bond and burying it in secret location.  That way you get your principal back without having to pay the negative rate.  Even if you expect the deflation rate to rise as high as  youd still be better off just storing the cash.  So for there to be enough demand to raise the bonds price there must be buyers that are not looking for a store of value central bank or for some reason are not able to store their cash more costeffectively than the negative yield theyd have to pay which perhaps could include a few very wealthy institutions I have no idea how much it costs to store billions of euros worth of cash.  Youd think a bank would just let you keep it with them for free.  In that case the only reason to buy negative yield bonds is the expectation that the central bank will be buying a ton of them.,Economics,cobcuap,-2,t5_2qh1s

3056633,0,t3_2v47nm,Noit wont solve inequality in America where all of the elements of mobility have been destroyed by those who climbed the ladders.The republican party has destroyed every option for the poor to ever work their way up to middle class and they still fight tooth and nail to protect and insulate the ultra wealthy and corporations.There was absolutely a time in America where the harder you worked the further you went. The future was wide open because there was a lot of opportunity and the government ENSURED that those opportunities existed because it was really the only way to justify telling workers to work their asses off.They had fair wages because of unions they had the best possible healthy insurance money could buy subsidized through the employersagain thanks to unions so the NUMBER ONE reason for bankruptcy in the US today wasnt even a potential threat to the vast majority of Americans. They were well protected and healthcare costs were established around the idea that health care is a vital part of the overall well being of a nation and NOT that health should be a luxury that only the wealthy can afford.The truth is that these days YOU ARE GOING BE BORN LIVE AND DIE IN THE EXACT CLASS YOU WERE BORN INTO. Its also very possible that you could slide from lower middle class into poverty. That happens every single day in America and it happens WAY more than Americans slide off into poverty rather than climb up.Why? Easyno more unions to protect workers and that means SHITTY slave wages for most people. You cant save up to start your own thing because you can barely even pay your rent and utilities. What else? Republicans this is not my opinion this is a fact have destroyed the elements in place to help those who are in poverty republicans REFUSE to make the ultra wealthy pay a fair tax rate they coddle corporations and allow them to avoid taxes and save money offshore. Remember Theyve been pushing this trickledown bullshit for almost  years now and the republicans out there are still dumb enough to believe that its coming.Also since wages are stagnant and job creators wont pay a fair wage theyre still sending jobs offshore profits are at record levels while wages are at record low levels. Why? Because without unions Americans are stupid enough to work for slave wages. When unions were strong and the dominating factor in American labor workers were smart enough to demand what their efforts were worth. They were smart enough to stand in solidarity because they realized that their combined strength and power was enough to outpower the company who liked to throw its weight around. America had the largest most affluent middle class in the entire world back before republicans sold their souls to the wealthy and the corporations and waged a war on the middle class.Of course the middle class takes some blame too for being stupid enough to listen to a handful of rich white males telling them Unions are corrupt! Unions are outdated!If Americans wouldve been smart enough to realize that rich white males rarely ever have anyones best interests in mind other than their own wallets they wouldve stood strong and defended the middle class. But lets face it Americans arent that smart when you get down to it. You have idiots who were in unions who bitched because they had to pay union dues. Yep. You had to pay  per week to earn on average an extra  per year. Not exactly Einstein on the lines there unfortunately.

If  is worth much less at the end of the loan than the beginning that sucks for the lender and works out great for the borrower. Inflation works in the borrowers favor.QE doesnt substantially increase the total money supply. It just transfers lessliquid money into liquid money.

3172216,0,t1_coqgodu,gtPublic unions are not particularly unique...Public unions are entirely different from private sector unions in that the purpose of the latter is to obtain a fair share of the profits of a business. That puts a reality check on the degree of their demands lest they destroy the business that pays them  and in fact gives them an incentive to cooperate with management to increase the productivity and thus profitability of the business.Public sector unions are totally different they do not share profits they take taxpayer money.  Their incentive is to obtain  monopoly power over public services and then use the that power to extract rent from the public without end up to the limit of the political systems tolerance.  See for instance the public sector unions here in NYC where strikes and threats of strikes by transit workers sanitation workers teachers etc have obtained compensation packages for them hugely higher than paid in the private sector for the same work.For these reasons the founders and leaders of the union movement itself denied that it was possible to organize public workers up until the s.It is impossible to bargain collectively with the government.George Meany legendary head of the A.F.L.C.I.O in .One also notes FDRs plainly stated policy of opposing unions for government workers that were capable of taking any such action as striking for higher pay.  To quoteMeticulous attention should be paid to the special relationships and obligations of public servants to the public itself and to the Government. All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining as usually understood cannot be transplanted into the public service...I want to emphasize my conviction that militant tactics have no place in the functions of any organization of Government employees. Upon employees in the Federal service rests the obligation to serve the whole people whose interests and welfare require orderliness and continuity in the conduct of Government activities. This obligation is paramount.Since their own services have to do with the functioning of the Government a strike of public employees manifests nothing less than an intent on their part to prevent or obstruct the operations of Government until their demands are satisfied.Such action looking toward the paralysis of Government by those who have sworn to support it is unthinkable and intolerable.,Economics,coqsrlo,2,t5_2qh1s

3180354,0,t3_2wk5op,gtThe Impact of Immigration on the Local Labor Market Outcomes of Blue Collar Workers Panel Data EvidencegtAbstractUsing a large administrative French panel data set for  we examine how loweducated immigration affects the wages employment occupations and locations of bluecollar native workers. The natives in the sample are initially in occupations heterogeneous in the presence of immigrants which might reflect a different degree of competition with loweducated immigrants. We first show that larger immigration inflows into locations are accompanied by larger outflows of negatively selected natives from these locations. At the same time larger immigrant inflows into occupations come with larger outflows of positively selected natives towards occupations with less routine tasks. While we find no negative impact on employment there is substantial evidence that immigrationlowers the median annual wages of natives. The estimated negative effects are also much larger in crosssection than in estimates controlling for composition effect which is consistent with the idea that endogenous changes in occupation and location attenuate the impact of immigration on natives wages. We also find much larger wage decreases for workers initially in nontradable sectors and more particularly in the construction sector which are much less likely to upgrade their occupation or change location in response to immigration inflows.Just because immigration affects the median or average of workers wages doesnt necessarily mean it actually changes the preimmigration wages of native workers. The other results they discussed involved what seemed to be a stronger effect on average wages than median wages. Is there any way to tell whether native workers individual wages actually changed vs. the idea that new lowpaid workers are only affecting these aggregate statistics without affecting the individual wages of the native population?,Economics,corn56i,2,t5_2qh1s

3279860,0,t3_2xoy9x,When analyzing an argument you should look address the argument not just whether or not the conclusions put forth by those making the argument came to pass.A comparison I always like to make is global warmingclimate change.  For many decades there have been people ringing the alarm regarding manmade climate change.  Many of these people made outlandish predictions that did not come to pass or certainly did not come to pass in the predicted timeline.  Should we take the failure of these predictions as evidence that climate change is bunk?  Obviously not.  The global climate is incredibly complex and we arent close to being able to model it with  accuracy.  Sure those predictions might have been wrong but that doesnt mean the science and logic that resulted in those predictions were wrong.I feel it is somewhat similar with what is happening with the inflation argument.  Yes inflation has not happened as many predicted.  Yes I was one of those that predicted significant inflation and yes I predicted some time frames for that inflation that now appear foolish.  Despite being wrong on those predictions it doesnt change my beliefs regarding future inflation because the argument still holds water for me.  The economy is extremely complex and just because my predictions have yet to come true doesnt mean I must necessarily abandon the arguments that led me to those predictions.When cash enters the economy its only going to cause inflation where that cash is spent and eventually circulates to.  If cash enters the economy through massive payouts to all citizens we should expect inflation across the board.  If for example we doubled the amount of money each person had we would expect prices across the board to double obviously not taking into account the debt people would pay off etc  as I said the economy is complex.  If instead we poured that exact same amount of class into a segment of the economy where the money does not trickle down to most people but instead just hangs in that segment of the economy we would expect inflation solely in that assets and goods that that area of the economy purchases.If for example we dumped the money into the banking sector where the money stays invested in assets that the wealthy prefer and never makes it to the average person we would expect overall inflation to remain low while inflation in those wealthy preferred assets to increase.  Youd expect to see inflation in stocks government bonds corporate bonds Aaa corporate bondsBaa commercial real estate and housing in high end markets insert graph here about home prices in NYCBay AreaLondonwhere ever.Again the economy is very complex and if there is one thing that the past  years have taught me its dont stick your neck out with predictions.  Focus on the underlying economic fundamentals and what they mean to the economy.  The short run of the economy is very difficult to predict and can turn on a dime very quickly.

People who criticize Obama usually dont like Keynesian economics so they come at it from the other side and put the Krugmans of the world on defense. But that doesnt mean the economy is great for everyone right now. We should be able to talk about the issues and still recognize that unemployment is down the deficit is down GDP is up and the stock market is up. Yet the numbers are funky. We all know that.

If external costs exist such as pollution the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for selfdirected action lies partly outside the self an element of externalization is involved. If there are external benefits such as in public safety less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others. For the purpose of these statements overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and costs to all parties involved.   Thus unregulated markets in goods or services with significant externalities generate prices that do not reflect the full social cost or benefit of their transactions such markets are therefore inefficientgtgtImage i  Air pollution from motor vehicles is an example of a negative externality. The costs of the air pollution for the rest of society is not compensated for by either the producers or users of motorized transport.Interesting Environmental economics | Network effect | Pecuniary externality | Positional good Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcphu oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecphu.

What a simple task. Might as well quit working now...This article like many of these are about the next couple of decades by which time there is no way in hell we will have anything close to artificial human intelligence unless you are some sort of religious scifi nut.  The hardware capability to simulate a human brain will be available for a reasonable investment within  to  decades but that is the most trivial aspect of the problem.  Hardware is the most trivial aspect of achieving human like artificial intelligence.  The most prominent people actually working on this dont claim we are anywhere close to this sort of thing.  There are technologist and people like that Google guy who do and who do no work actually contributing to the field.  Their expertise is in making up fairly tales and acting like theyre right around the corner.By the time the hardware is developed we may be starting to get a better understanding of how the human brain transitions into a sleep state and then will probably be a large number of centuries away from a complete understanding of the brains operation.Before that ever happens people will get bored trying and develop a simulated environment capable of growing an artificial brain inside a computer system based on human DNA.  Probably a few more centuries out.Then everyone will be disappointed at the grand revealing when the first digital human clone does nothing but cry for a while.  Some poor saps probably some grad students will have to spend a lot of time training this new intelligence.After about  years of training it will be about as intelligent as a human teenager.  It will not want to spend much time learning however after it discovers some superrealistic virtual pornography environment it can play in.At this time it is decided that what we really need is some modified human like intelligence.  Well just need to tweak the DNA a bit to program the brain to be better.  Thats all it will take some simple tweaking to improve things more than millions of years of evolution.  Some computer programmer could probably do it in a few weeks assuming he was working at least  hours a week and he has read Sams teach yourself DNA in  hours programming book.A few thousand years later and low and behold there is an intelligence threshold after which there is little benefit and most humans have already hit that threshold.

After a few super AI robots go postal after getting pissed at us treating them like dirt we decide its better off not having human like AI.

The free rider comment was about why your contribution might be different in a public pension scheme vs. private retirement account. People have an incentive to free ride in the voluntary provision of public goods. In this case contributions to the pension system are voluntary because you can increase or decrease your number of hours worked at least at the margin. You dont have the same incentive to reduce the number of hours worked under a private retirement account because contributing less only reduces your own future income.,Economics,cpari4k,13,t5_2qh1s
3359202,0,t1_cpayaph,Thank you for sharing a more current study on this issue.Ive examined several studies which have attempted to dispel the notion of wage suppression over the past  decades.  However none of them have made a compelling case.  Ill try to go through the big issues as briefly as possible.First as this citation reveals there has been a significant disconnect between gross wages and productivity in the U.S. in recent decades.  However the study has attempted to dispel that economic impact by focusing on the net effect impact.  The problem is that we have never examined this issue from that perspective in the past.  Its not that we shouldnt examine this issue in that manner its that doing so at the th hour results in an apples and oranges comparison when examining the long term history involved.  I have yet to see historical benefit data that is nearly as complete as what we see with wageincome data.Second if the point of a study is to determine whether wages have kept pace with productivity at the individual level then the addition of benefit costs which are not borne by employees distorts the economic impact on the individuals involved.  I can see where it might make sense to examine these combined cost factors from a company perspective but thats not the stated goal of this study.  If that was the intent of the study authors then they should have retitled this study The coupling of all company labor costs and productivity?  Myth or reality?  After all that would be more consistent with the assumptions and parameters used here.Finally there is quite a bit of healthy debate regarding the approprite inflation deflator i.e. CPI vs PCE.  Many economists appear to favor PCE.  While I see virtues in using both metrics under the proper circumstance Im not a huge fan of either one because they do a poor job of reflecting the true rate of inflation and loss of purchasing power in the U.S.  I favor CPI over PCE for wageincome analysis for all of its faults simply because PCE measures aspects of the economy that have no direct bearing on the cost of living that people face in their daily lives.  Hopefully well see inflation metrics that come a LOT closer to individual microeconomic reality in the not too distant future.TLDR  While I appreciate the hard work put into this study the assumptions and data used in it led to a flawed conclusion.  It is a companyfocused not an individually focused economic analysis.  Wageincome studies should be just that...wageincome studies.  Benefits are a longstanding business cost not an individual cost.  Yes that has been changing in recent years based on some creative financial engineering but its not been a historical practice in this economy.,Economics,cpb69uq,-1,t5_2qh1s

3367923,0,t1_cpc4ofd,gtYou say you took shop class but didnt know how to use a tape measure because you dont learn via books and illustrations? Didnt you actually use a tape measure in shop class?Sure we used them. But if you told me to measure a x   and ths I couldnt. That is a skill that was necessary in my second full time job I had to learn by using a tape measure that had the measurements listed on the tape. It wasnt until I started to go through the motions of measuring things that it call came together. gtThe web site thing seems like the sort of thing one should have covered in a computer class in school. Thats a thing now isnt it? Maybe they wouldnt cover that specific sequence of steps but navigating a web site and sending email is pretty basic.They never taught us about the Internet really. They let us go on the computer in the library and we would use computers to type and print work. But I never really learned how to email until I had my own computer in . If I had a job where they wanted me to email a customer and navigate a webpage and ask someone questions or relay information I likely would have been lost if it wasnt for my at home experience on the internet. In fact it wasnt until I got my own computer that I fully understood how to type without looking. gtIn any case this wouldnt explain the low relative performance of the US as the US doesnt have particularly high youth unemployment.Its likely a combination of inadequate schooling and a lack of on the job training for more technical tasks. I suffered from both. School simply wasnt a very good experience for me as I said I learned best when I wasnt being pressured by people and if I was I could learn much quicker being pressured in a job setting than in a classroom full of distractions. And I didnt get a whole lot of work experience while in school. I had two part time summer jobs and a part time job in the winter which was my senior year. It became my first full time job. School didnt do anything for my success but the part time jobs I had did they taught me how to work hard to show up on time to listen and to be more organized and helpful. School taught me to resent authority and wasted away a large portion of time that would have been better spent on other things. gtAlso the technology stuff aside if people are graduating from college without basic practical math and literacy skills that strikes me as evidence for the proposition that college is basically wasted on the marginal student. If theyre not even retaining the basics what are the odds that theyre retaining anything else?This is an excellent point. And essentially my ramblings are attempting to touch on this subject. Some people are just better off spending less time reading books and listening to lectures and more time learning things on the job. Because if you are willing to show up on time to work hard to actually make an effort most employers will teach you and give you a chance. You may end up doing the crappy remedial jobs that nobody else wants to do but once you learn a few things and prove your worth employers will give you more responsibilities which lead to learning more skills. High School was wasted on me. The main worth of high school for me was that I didnt have not graduating hanging over my head when I did try to get a job with my limited work experience. But who knows maybe if success wasnt measured so much by graduation dropping out and entering the job market might be more acceptable and valuable. But compulsory education or an overall lack of proper education for people that learn differently may actually end up setting people back despite having a diploma. Many kids are pushed through school or go through the motions just to get by like I did. ,Economics,cpc6301,3,t5_2qh1s

Do I deserve a raise because my employer shelled out for me to have a faster working computer that computes without locking up? Conversely if my employer invests in me to learn a new skill set which appreciates my value on the open market do they deserve some of the benefit without giving me the full amount of value increase in my salary?

Also using a pejorative for a policy that was coined by people that dont understand what is actually advocated in what they deride as trickle down economics isnt a good way to make points with me. Trickle down is a term used by people that have little to no understanding of how money flows for businesses especially those that start up as every business had to do at some point.Businesses start by paying everyone but the owner first. Its not trickledown its spending heavy usually invested capital either by the owner or shareholders which if it works according to plan half the time it doesnt and it just fails outright then after the suppliers employees and everyone else are paid if there is a profit the owner hopefully recoops not only his cost but is paid on the surplus valueutility heshe has created in the market.

3384382,0,t1_cpdlzo6,gtThere seems to be a persistent belief among some that regulations do nothing but stifle innovation.The argument is twofold First regulation tends to stifle innovation by both protecting incumbent industry by increasing the cost of entry and by limiting what the market could deliver. So for instance higher administrative costs favor bigger companies because they have economies of scale to absorb the costs. New companies have to face the same administrative costs but are just starting out so they do not have the revenue to or specific knowledge to comply as easily. Also lets say a school wants to innovate the curriculum and offer more practical classes like personal finance. Well schools are required to teach certain subjects like calculus which while useful may not be as useful for everyone. Second regulations are usually favor incumbent industries because they capture the bodies who make the laws. So the regulations will tend to favor them in such a way that the former issue I described becomes more cumbersome. gtFor example it might be innovative to roll hamburgers in feces before serving but it is not wise and there are regulations in place to discourage the practice.That is the worst analogy Ive ever seen. It seems you have the persistent belief that absent these regulations people would be eating shit sandwiches or have nails in their soup.

An economy run by corporations with weak government controls is almost identical to a plutocracy which is itself very nearly identical to the aristocracy forming a feudal society.

Large corporations these days do not have the same problems of tracking and controlling large numbers of workers since they have computers to do so and since the productivity per worker has risen faster than the amount they are paid it is worth using more resources to do so as well.

This is hardly surprising the evidence suggests that conventional QE is an unreliable tool for boosting GDP or employment.gt Bank of England research shows that it benefits the welloff who gain from increasing asset prices much more than the poorest. In the eurozone where interest rates are at rock bottom and bond yields have already turned negative injecting even more liquidity into the markets will do little to help the real economy.gt There is an alternative. Rather than being injected into the financial markets the new money created by eurozone central banks could be used to finance government spending such as investing in much needed infrastructure projects alternatively each eurozone citizen could be given  per month for  months which they could use to pay down existing debts or spend as they please. By directly boosting spending and employment either approach would be far more effective than the ECBs plans for conventional QE.gt The ECB will argue that this approach breaks the taboo of mixing monetary and fiscal policy. But traditional monetary policy no longer works. Failure to consider new approaches will unnecessarily prolong stagnation and high unemployment. It is time for the ECB and eurozone central banks to bypass the financial system and work with governments to inject newly created money directly into the real economy.,Economics,cpveyhk,3,t5_2qh1s

To complain that monetarism influenced fiscal policy is idiotic. Politicians cant manage a fried egg let alone a comprehensive fiscal stimulus package. DeLongs comments on the Great Depression run contrary to the majority of the macro field as well as his own earlier comments.The tldr is that nuking the money supply was bad and that gold inflows and subsequently abandoning the gold standard pushed economic growth in the s. Fiscal stimulus from the New Deal was weak.  DeLong has a good meme about abandoning the gold standard and recovery in the Great Depression.

It goes something like this Low rates arent correlated with growth and a not useful to predict future growth. The government is a net payer of interest. Lower rates mean less interest payments to the nongovernment. Less interest payments less currency injection. The interest rate isnt that big an expense for a business and therefore not high on the list for borrowing decisions. Budget items like labor costs or sales revenue are more important and also affected by AD.  So monetary policy during times with low AD is an effort to lower a less important cost to spur lending that isnt justified by economic fundamentals. Businesses are procyclical and reducing a notsoimportant cost isnt likely to move that needle enough to be useful.

If the government decrees that some of it be used for one purpose it cannot be used for another. government spending does not magically make us richer.That is exactly what MMT economists contend. Not similar... not kinda close... literally the same argument. That real productive capacity establishes the boundaries. That decisions about government spending are decisions about real resource allocation between the public and private spheres.Government spending does not magically remove those boundaries it is however critical to whether we fully utilize the space within those limits. Because the nominal and real are tightly coupled in the economy. If there is a nominal shortfall real activity is reduced making us poorer.

Additionally if there are any accompanying tasks like paperwork or other admin work those admin tasks can end up eating up more and more of the time you could be spending on your actual work if you focused on just one job.With all of those possible inefficiencies including traveling to all of your different jobs attending additional meetings shifting schedules etc. that leaves less time for the daytoday necessities of life. It also leaves less time for additional education or jobs training that can be used to better oneself. For example Ive held a fulltime job while working toward an advanced degree in a highly indemand field. Obtaining this degree would not be possible if I worked multiple jobs parttime. There just wouldnt be enough time in the day to travel work study complete mandatory lab work for classes and do necessary things like cook.I dont have any problem with these parttime jobs as supplementary income  but I think well have large workforce problems if we start to rely on cobbling several of these parttime jobs together to create a simulacrum of fulltime employment.

If you look at it like that its absolutely clear that the government can get huge amount of benefit out of it and hurting the people by doing so.gt There is no difference for a government because it issues the currency. It does not have an income. You point about funding itself through taxes is nonsense governments drain money from the system using taxes and other systems. Thats MMT nonsense. Its absolutely not helpful to argue this way. The central bank does its own thing and has its own goals. The fiscal government does its own thing and has its own goals and its own income. The hole reason we do divide those things is so that the fiscal government does not use the monetary system for its own means. We deliberately try to make the central bank independent. gt That means what? Right now when a bank makes a loan it creates money.That depends on what you define as money. The hole point of studying banking and monetary theory is to better understand those sort of questions. Just saying a lone is money is a vast oversimplification.gt The fuck? Of course it was a performance issue. The Great Depression lasted longer in countries that took longer to leave the gold standard. The countries that did it faster were able to get out of the great depression earlier. This news just in. Great Depression happened before WW. As I said you dont seem to understand the difference between gold standards. The preWW gold standard was perfectly fine. The interwar standard is a hole different beast and it is the reason for the Great Depression. That would not have happened with the preWW standard or at least would be extremely unlikely. Maybe you should read up on the differences.Free Banking is about the banks not having regulation to issue notes and other services in competition. The reserve currency bitcoin gold or any fiat currency is the reserve that the bank has to keep to service incoming cashflow. Currently banks are not allowed to dynamically adjust its reserve ratio depending on cashflow they are also not allowed to do many other things. If banks are not allowed to do that then you dont need a lender of last resort you dont really need to reserve currency issuer to do much at all. This is nicely shown by the Free Banking System we had in the past and by the Theory of Free Banking see   The overall money supply dynamically adjust to money demand because banks are able to adjust there reserve ratio. This is very different from the current system where banks have minimum required reserve ratio and relay on the Fed to solve the liquidity problem. This is essentially the same thing some people want to achieve with things like NGDP targeting witch I like if you have central bank.So the idea is to set the system up like that so that the monetary authority has almost nothing to do except invent some form of reserve currency and maybe they can increase or decrease it a bit here and there . The banking system then takes over and does all the things it used to in a gold system. The fiscal government works by itself and finances itself by taxation. The two things are as far separated as possible this prevents abuse by the fiscal government but still allows to have a dynamic monetary system that does all the things we currently trying to do. The hole reason I want to set it up this way is because political economy and history have taught us that dividing power that way is a good idea.gt Never said it was abstract or idealised.You talk about it as if the government does not consist of people that could gain profits from abusing the monetary system. You ignore the intensive structures that are set up.gt Is there some paradise on Earth ....I am still absolutely baffled why you continue to argue as this is a argument about the existence of government. This is about setting government up in a way that it is not going to backfire. We do this with many things in government.

3915182,0,t1_cr1olap,I dont think the definition of NIMBYism youve stated gets to the heart of the matter.  No homeowner has to think of themselves as native have an intrinsic dislike of nonresidents moving in or even like living in San FranciscoNYC to have a strong incentive to maintain zoning regulations.  As the article discusses these laws inflate property values tremendously.  If the laws were relaxed residents overpriced homes would fall in value.  This is a strong incentive for residents to keep the laws in place.Heres a way to think about the chain of events. If San Francisco relaxed zoning laws huge new developments would increase the housing supply and rent would fall.  The price of a home is to an approximation the NPV of its future stream of rents. Therefore homeowners should oppose new developments.Another way to think of it is that existing property owners are like monopolists in the market for homes and zoning laws are anticompetition laws.  I think moralizing the issue too much is dangerous because it overlooks this very fundamental political economy problem.  It leads one to think Oh if only we could get these rabid militants to chill out a little we could solve the problem.  The problem arises even if everyone is completely coolheaded. That makes it much harder to solve. ,Economics,cr2ke0i,13,t5_2qh1s

Also keep in mind when you say that you add K in the value to the company you are isolating the pure contribution of labor and also not counting the value added by capital and the value added by the entrepreneur.

4118909,0,t1_crovqd7,I get what you mean however you fail to consider the increased tax revenue from all of those workers who get an actual raise which pretty much offsets specific cases of poorly handled businesses having to close. Its basic economics that working class people spend more of their income so increasing their revenue has a high impact on demand which means more jobs in the medium to long term. For more info on the impact of raising minimum wage on employment  gt This is the core problem America has experienced an increase in the supply of unskilled labor while experiencing a decrease in the demand for it.I agree with you here but its causes to put it simply globalization and automation mean that neither the minimum wage nor the EITC are solutions to it. The only way to avoid this gap is to make higher education more broadly available because its fairly certain in about  to  years most unskilled jobs and even some skilled ones will be performed by robots. Even at . an hour most of these jobs wont survive the competition of both robots and cheap labour. Weve known this for decades but student debts and tuition fees keep soaring...So in the end I dont even really see raising the minimum wage as an economic policy in the sense that its impact on the economy is minimal. I simply find it normal for it to catch up on inflation and its the cheapest way for the federal government to pull many people out of poverty. Of course it might mean some businesses will have to be reorganized but I dont believe in the apocalyptic theory that the economy will go to shit because of this simply because the facts shows it doesnt.,Economics,crps4sn,1,t5_2qh1s

I actually doesnt have much to do with prices nor price based competition.....which is exactly WHY competition law concerns itself with this matter. in general competition law deals with what to do when a firm tries to establish or maintain dominance in the marketplace via means other than price and market  based competition. which...again I understand the AE position similar to the classical econ one that in an ideal world this isnt supposed to happen. But hold that ideological stance doesnt exempt anybody from having to come up with a plan to deal with this problem when it arises.Abuse of dominant position  has to do with instances in which a firm uses its market power or size to eliminate rivals. Heres the official Canadian definition of it which is the most specific definition of it Ive seen so far. The UK legal definition is also good conduct which amounts to exclusionary behaviour because itremoves or weakens competition from existing competitors orestablishes or strengthens entry barriers thereby removing orweakening potential competition.So... setting aside what wed like to see in an ideal world how would AE advise a judge to rule in such a case? ,Economics,cs8og8e,1,t5_2qh1s

The assumption that the markets would quickly and correctly make is that those debts would in the event of disaster end up backed by the states and that state debts in the end would be backed by the eurozone because the alternative is a complete disaster. This crisis has only grown acute when the ECB and Germany have called that last assumption into question by tempting euro suicide.

4479733,0,t3_3cgop3,BRUSSELSEurozone leaders were considering proposals on Tuesday to provide Greece with emergency financing to avert another default in exchange for passing at least some of the economic measures Greek voters rejected last weekend.Not much time is left until Greeces banksbasically closed for over a week nowrun out of cash which would push the already suffering country deeper into recession and a possible exit from the currency. But with German Chancellor Angela Merkel standing firm on her calls for overhauls in exchange for aid the big question was how much Greece was willing to accept.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras came to a meeting of eurozone leaders in Brussels with a proposal for interim financing until the end of the month a senior Greek government official said.In return Greece will pass some of the overhauls demanded by the countrys international creditors the official said adding that Greece remained open to other ideas for a big viable solution.France which has been Greeces biggest eurozone ally is pushing for a deal in which Athens accepts and passes the budgetary measureswith limited changesthat were in the plan that was rejected by Greek voters in their referendum Sunday.Greece would then receive immediate financing and the prospect of a future restructuring of its debt a senior French official said.Effectively nothing has changed after the referendum said the official adding that eurozone leaders could meet again Sunday to wrap up the details.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives at the euro zone emergency summit. ENLARGEGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives at the euro zone emergency summit. PHOTO REUTERSIn a wave of support for Mr. Tsipras Greeks overwhelmingly voted against the additional pension cuts and tax increases demanded by lenders for additional funding. But Ms. Merkel noted earlier that time was running out.Without reforms the path that we have to take wont be possible she said. I say that this isnt a matter of weeks but of days.In the absence of a new aid deal Greece would be unable to make a . billion . billion bond repayment to the European Central Bank on July .That would be its second major default in less than a month and would make it difficult for the ECB to maintain its emergency lending to Greek banks. A cut to that support would lead most banks to collapse and could force the government to issue its own currency to recapitalize them.Mr. Tsipras is hoping to use the leverage from his referendum victory to win enough of a political nudge from the summit that would allow the ECB to keep the lifeline in place.He raised the idea of interim financing with Ms. Merkel French President Franois Hollande and JeanClaude Juncker head of the European Unions executive Commission ahead of the summit the Greek official said adding that it would be discussed further during the summit itself.The French official said that once Greece got the immediate financing the two sides would negotiate a two to threeyear deal that would involve cutting the interest rates and extending the maturities on Greeces debt. Athens then would pass the more longterm measures demanded by its creditors such as liberalizing service industries.Earlier many finance ministers said that an exit from the eurozone would be hard to avoid if Athens doesnt implement the measures its voters have rejected.RELATED READINGTsipras Rides a Wave at Home but to Where?Short Answer What Would Grexit Look Like?QampA Whats Next for Greece and for Europe?Obama Urges Compromise on Emergency FinancingGermanys Power Polarizes EuropeCountdown to a Greek ShowdownGreeces new finance chief Euclid Tsakalotos entered that meeting without a word as did his French colleague Michel Sapin who has been the countrys strongest ally in the currency union in recent weeks.Emboldened by Sundays poll results Mr. Tsiprass government sought a consensus with opposition parties for a new bailout proposal to present. But that plan offered no economicpolicy specifics beyond a call to reduce Greeces debt mountain.At the socalled Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers Mr. Tsakalotos read out proposals the government had presented last week but promised that a new plan would be sent to creditors on Wednesday three European officials said. That would allow Mr. Tsipras to await the outcome of the summit before he commits to any new moves.New Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos center is welcomed by Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem left and French Finance Minister Michel Sapin right in Brussels Tueday.Afterward Finlands Finance Minister Alexander Stubb said he expected a new request for a rescue program from Greece imminently perhaps within a few hours. After that Greece would send a list of measures the government is prepared to implement in return for more aid.Countdown to a Greek ShowdownENLARGEAnother area that could still require compromise between Athens and the other  eurozone governments is Greeces towering debt which stood at  of gross domestic product at the end of last year.The International Monetary Fund which Greece technically defaulted on last month has said comprehensive debt relief should be included in any further bailout.But divisions still run deep in Europe. Were not willing to reduce Greeces debt burden Mr. Stubb said. We did that already in  we did that also in .Other ministers were more open to debt relief.We have to listen to all the options said Luxembourgs Pierre Gramegna who also suggested a bridge financing deal that could help Athens survive until a longerterm aid program has been set up.Germanys Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel raised the option of reducing Greeces debt loadbut only if the government commits to overhaul its economy.His comment published Tuesday in an interview with weekly magazine Stern runs counter to those from Germanys finance minister who on Tuesday again ruled out a haircut.If we now simply wipe out debt without a lot in Greece changing fundamentally we wont gain anything said Mr. Gabriel who is also Germanys economics minister. One can talk about the possibility to reduce debt only if the Greek government proves that it implements reforms.Eurozone finance ministers would assess any request for a new aid program in a conference call on Wednesday said Jeroen Dijsselbloem the Dutch finance minister who presides over Eurogroup meetings. Any decision on whether to formally start negotiations then requires yet another round of talks among ministers Mr. Dijsselbloem said.Many finance ministers expressed misgivings at how long it was taking Greece to deliver its proposals.Im very disappointed quite simply very disappointed because I had a strong impression that everybody really feels a sense of urgency except the Greek government said Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt.

California banks will continue to make loans until Tennessee borrowers are in deep trouble and the whole kit and kaboodle goes belly up.  this is a very old and common story in finance.this is why the central government in the United States takes money from California and gives it to Tennessee.  you can moralize all you want.  as Clint Eastwood once said deserves got nothin to do with it.and California should be happy to do it. they have a captive export market that they harvest relentlessly and then they further profit through their banks.  that is not a bad deal. ,Economics,csz16zq,1,t5_2qh1s

In an experiment we disentangle three major characteristics of market interaction diffusion of responsibility social information and market framing and provide evidence for how these characteristics influence behavior when trade harms uninvolved parties. We model the negative externalities from trade by reducing donations to a charity that provides meals to needy children. Our results show that diffusion of responsibility tends to encourage subjects to make purely selfinterested decisions. This holds to a much larger extent if the economic trans action is framed as a market. In contrast social information increases social responsibility in our setting. Observing the behavior of others seems to convince a substantial fraction of people to behave steadfastly i.e. they avoid trading a good that comes with negative externalities even if gains from trade are high. ,Economics,ctqy4gd,1,t5_2qh1s

How is a railway system best regulated?To which one has to add a third What kind of rail system does the UK need that will also be selffunding?Britain pioneered railways and the legacy doesnt really answer to contemporary needs. You need an automated freight system and separately urbansuburban rail systems that may or may not be connected by intercity lines. The commuter lines pay for themselves the intercity on the whole does not. Freight needs to be dedicated to eg containers power station fly ash oil products and similar routine routes. Once you have  sorted then  and  tend to answer themselves. But if the state is going to mandate uneconomic services then the state has to pay for these and if very expensive upgrades are demanded then these also need to be funded if they are uneconomic from cash flow. That though is a part of the regulatory role of the state which has nothing to do with ownership or management. It does raise the question of when the state as agent or owner becomes central. Few would think about privatising defence because the state has a monopoly on force. Policing becomes a greyer area and the US spends about as much on private as public policing. Roads generally seem to settle in statefunded smaller roads and privately funded tolls although not in Britain. That will change with road pricing I think. Prisons are tending to become private institutions globally. Then you get to the emotive stuff health and education. There is no reason why it is better fro the state to deliver these even if it pays for them but people fuss when you suggest that sound regulation with outsourcing of services is the way forward. Indeed health outsourcing is the great unmentionable of UK politics. Why? Propaganda mostly from the very professional PA systems of the millionodd health employees and the very loud teachers unions.

The intent is protection of American jobs whereas reality would be more than doubling the consumer price which would shrink the purchase power of American consumer and net sales revenue followed by production of inferior products to save costs. Not to mention the potential retaliatory effect of banning trade protected products from entering the Chinese market which in some cases would shrink net revenue of a company by half. All of which would increase the risk of a company going into bankruptcy. If a company doesnt exist there are still no American jobs. Trade protection is the business equivalent of increasing government services while decreasing taxes. How does that help Americans?Furthermore American competitiveness in manufacture is weak as a result of the countrys shift towards a service based nation. Service based economies are directly tied to access for higher education of general populous compared to a manufacturing economy which utilizes unskilled labor force.Let say we can have our cake and eat it too it means US workers have to be willing to work or is able to feed their family for  a day work ampgt hour workweek and live at a manufacturing plant designed housing complex like the Chinese workers.

Since the level of rates was presumably affecting bank profitability it is clear that banks then did not have the duration of their liabilities and assets matched.gt gt gt gt As this affected the level of the policy rate this greatly impressed monetary economists and so this episode is burned into their memories. As a result this mechanism low interest rates are good for bank net lending spreads is kept in mind.gt gt gt gt However they did not notice the Great Bond Bear Market of . A few firms blew up when interest rates where renormalised and it scarred a generation of financial market participants. It possibly explains why senior people in finance are dedicated bond bears. At the same time advances in digital computing allowed for widespread risk measurement.

In the real world you are going to have some optimal level of inequality and given the enormous uncertainties and complex feedback mechanisms involved I do not believe for a second that the precise level of inequality which would maximize overall entrepreneurship can be determined from a model developed a by a small team. Id be surprised if they can even consistently define entrepreneurial effort in a way that corresponds closely to reality.

This is usually their starter home that they do this with instead of selling it.The horrible thing is that they can get the lowest interest rates when buying the new house because they have so much equity. Whereas the first time home buyer will pay a much higher interest rate. So they make a fortune from the rent they pay less for their houses and then they make money from investing in dividend paying bank stocks just to add icing on the cake. But then it gets worse. Their old house then has semigrandfathered tax rates so if a first time home buyer did buy their old house the tax bill would be much higher than the boomer was paying.Then to add insult to injury the city is corrupt as fuck so it only lets the worst developers do stuff. So few housing cooperatives or anything citizen oriented. Just high end condo developments.

Removing a management company pretty much requires the approval of the management company. So in Halifax it isnt unusual for a condo fee in a pretty basic place pushing up around  per month for a  bdrm condo. Also some asshole property companies have gone around buying houses and turning them into condos. I dont mean tearing them down and building a multi unit dwelling just calling it a condo and then selling it.

In addition how and why would the reserve go about making a  interest rate? You know commercial banks pay their clients whatever interest rates they feel like right?

5497249,0,t1_cwe5mv9,Youre mistaking aggregate behaviour that just naturally arises out of circumstances with force.  For example if I was controlling the air conditioning in a building I might crank the heat up to C F.  Now you could say that everybody in the building has free will but under those conditions its likely some of them would start taking off their sweaters.  In that sense Im controlling their free will by changing circumstances to create an expected and predicted response.  Thats a really simplistic example compared to lotto and its impacts and benefits but how about thisIm The Government.  I decide I want more people to invest in some kind of shady government bond scheme.  So I offer a tax incentive to invest in my shady government bonds.  Economists in the newspaper are pointing out that the bonds are shady and probably will lose money but Im advertising and saying theyre a pretty good deal and youll get a tax break.  Now Im not forcing anybody to buy my shady government bonds but Ill probably greatly increase the number of people doing so by doing this.I think force is the wrong term.   Its more like setting up circumstances that obviously will have an impact on what people do. Lottery tickets work by selling you the slim slim hope that your shitty circumstances will be better.  Predictably the shittier your circumstances the more likely you will try to bank on them.  Obviously not all will but studies like this show that many do.  They give out little payouts  or  that predictably mostly get spent back on more lotto tickets to trigger a sense of hope.  So yes the people buying lots of tickets have free will but if you set up a system known to have a certain effect on people and you know that effect is detrimental to them well...  youre kind of fucking with them arent you?People have a degree of free will but we also have a lot of reflexes and impulses that are pretty easy to manipulate if you have the resources.  Why do you think advertising is such a big money industry?  Its not just about telling people that product X exists but about manufacturing a demand for product X by using well established tricks.Im not saying lottery tickets are bad necessarily just pointing out the rationale here that the free will argument is way too simplistic.,Economics,cwebqdf,17,t5_2qh1s

If not then theyre not getting enough support today so whether its distributed as BI or current programs is orthogonal to the problem.gt More to the point current welfare program are targeted at the  at the low end of the wage curve UBI would give money to everyone.If the BI is financed by higher income tax the BI would essentially compensate for the higher taxes of many in the top . For those who prefer a tax curve thats more similar today the negative income tax may be more acceptable. This gives cash refunds to low earners at tax time which slowly phases out into a standard tax bill when earning above a certain income. This could have very similar tax rates today but replace noncash benefits with cash and eliminate welfare traps by ensuring each marginal dollar always results in net positive earnings  benefits. I prefer basic income because of its simplicity and more frequent payment schedule but NIT illustrates that BI is affordable.In general there are two main reasons to support a BI which hold regardless of your stance on whether we can afford it. It replaces noncash benefitswhich are expensive to administer difficult for recipients to navigate and comply with and which limit recipients liberty in the marketplacewith cash which has no such problems.. It removes work disincentives by ensuring each dollar earned doesnt result in lost benefits as is clear when everyone gets the cash.From  we know we can replace noncash benefits like food stamps and housing assistance with their cash equivalents. But this can still create welfare traps based on the mechanics of many programs meanstesting.  solves this problem.By definition if we can afford noncash benefits we can afford the cash equivalent. It can also be shown that any basic income proposal can also be implemented as NIT with identical net earnings for all individuals and vice versa. Between these two ideas we know that any welfare state can be converted into a basic income without relying on efficiencies though those are likely. Some who earn near the welfare trap lines may do a bit better or worse than today those earning a bit below a bit worse those above a bit better in order to smooth out the work disincentives but in aggregate most people would get the same net amounts.,Economics,cxr7i02,1,t5_2qh1s

Overall emissions declined too by  between  and . At the same time BCs consumption of aviation fuel which is exempt from the tax remained in line with other provinces bolstering the case that the shift can be attributed to the tax and not some other factor.gtgtCrucially the levy does not appear to have hurt families the poor and businesses as opponents argued it would.

6560337,0,t3_45h6oi,gtOur conclusion is that in the absence of substantial greenhouse gas policies the US and the global economy are unlikely to stop relying on fossil fuels as the primary source of energy. The physical supply of fossil fuels is highly unlikely to run out especially if future technological change makes major new sources like oil shale and methane hydrates commercially viable. Alternative sources of clean energy like solar and wind power which can be used both to generate electricity and to fuel electric vehicles have seen substantial progress in reducing costs but at least in the short and middleterm they are unlikely to play a major role in baseload electrical capacity or in replacing petroleumfueled internal combustion engines.

6600687,0,t1_d020ujo,At first I thought it was a different person replying to me with the same source quote and I was like wait didnt I already read that?Then I realised it was the same person writing about the same subject.Where I object is to the way you have framed the issue. I have never stated that FDI is bad earlier I argued that some FDI can be beneficial i.e. building roads bridges hospitals etc even where it is profitable for the company building it.Your argument however is that FDI can only be obtained where all public goods are commodities for private sale and where a government makes no movement at all toward control of how markets interface with public services. Otherwise in your back half of the argument it is considered socialism and nobody will be at all interested in investing.So its a black and white binary issue free market or socialism. I wouldnt want to spend time arguing under such a characterisation because its not accurate nor necessary. I did try my best to point out that the problems in Venezuela now are the same problems manifesting again as they did prior to its socialist leaning and that these relate to poor diversification of the economy rather than choice of political model. I would go so far to argue that even if Chavez is a very poor leader hes no different in that sense than any who came before or any that are likely to come later assuming a more liberalist leader rises to power at some stage. More importantly the Chicago School style economy has been tried in the country before. The people hate it and in particular the IMF with a very serious passion. Any leader who attempts to move in that direction and worse to involve them is headed for political instability at best and total anarchy at worst. Finally you brought up the main issue in most countries looking to adopt a more leftwing positiongt it has a lot to do with a country decoupling from world economic institutions...The battle for dominance between the markets and democracy has been the decisive characterisation of the last  years worth of politics in a nutshell. A number of countries Greece Portugal Ireland Spain Venezuela other SA Italy etc have elected leftwing governments who attempted either to limit the influence of markets in general or to remove the influence of markets from areas of public life they found to be inappropriate domains. In all of those cases enormous economic and political pressure was brought to bear on all of them to enforce subservience and those who resisted were either threatened with bankruptcy or abandoned entirely. In this context despite the fact that the language used is almost always economic terminology the force behind the attack is ideological. By that precisely I mean the demand that all areas of the market be liberalised and opened to international investors for example is underpinned by a belief that such acts inherently result in a positive outcome ie greater efficiency or growth.What is overlooked is the cost of that choicein that something of value is often destroyed a domestic industry for example in the process. In fact it is almost always a human cost that is paid in pensioners or welfare services.The point in that context is that markets and certain ideologues in power dont careand that as a result the march against public ownership continues incessantly. Essentially I disagree fundamentally that the issues in Venezuela are as simple as scaring markets and overspending. And even where there are clear errors in leadership I think it is instead worth having a leader who thinks that there ought to be some limits to the reach of the markets and some items of the public good shielded. I think there is value in not accepting carte blanche that the market has the best solution all the time. In that sense some of what Chavez did was the right thing.,Economics,d022cvt,0,t5_2qh1s

We dont need a million different healthcare programs and tuition assistance programs.Notice how these two industries have massive government subsidies and intrusion. Does that not signal that the federal government is not interested in reducing costs for consumers? Could it be that the federal government is the source of a problem and giving it more control will simply entrench the problem?gtWe need a singlepayer healthcare program that covers everyone and free public college tuition.Given that well have the same government tomorrow as we have today all this will do is destroy the countrys finances as the US federal government has proven for  years that it cares more about feeding revenues to healthcare industryuniversities than it does about controlling costs for taxpayers. It would be like granting Goldman Sachs a monopoly on US banking because you think theyll look out for you after they get a monopoly.Other developed country governments many have multipayer systems by the way have proven that cost containment in both healthcare and university is a goal. Our government has done nothing but proven the opposite revenue growth is our governments goal.gtPeople think that those things are big government but in reality what we have now is big government.Yes you are advocating giving the same big rapacious government the opportunity to expand its reach further. How could you expect any other result than what weve been seeing for decades?gtDue to the greed and profitseeking motives of private lenders and insurance companies the government has no choice but to operate inefficiently and spend far more time money and resources in order to provide a decent standard of living to those who are struggling.The government is by far the largest student lender in the country gt of loans and is by far the largest health insurer  of US healthcare spending. The cause of both high university and healthcare costs is government policy that incentivizes high costs. Giving more control to an organization that prioritizes rising costs over effectively any other metric will not reduce costs for Americans.And further why the fuck does the American government have no choice but to ban drug reimportation ban Medicare from negotiating drug prices put no cost controls on universities while it offers student loans without any underwriting etc? The government wants to operate inefficiently because its more concerned about generating revenues for key constituents healthcare universities than it is for saving taxpayerscitizens money. Thats the same government that you want to hand the keys to the kingdom to.Heres my plan prove to me through action and results that the government can reduce costs with the massive control it currently exerts over these industries and then Id be willing to hand them full control.

Taxation should be considered separate from government spending.  A lot of writing and thought has gone into this e.g. why oil taxes shouldnt just be about funding roads or lottery taxes funding schools etc.  Tax policy should be focused on optimal revenue generation optimal spending is then a separate subject.So a tax can be regressive or progressive but how it is spent doesnt change that.  There is a strong political denial to acknowledge how progressive US taxes are and thats where the motivation to couple the spending side into things comes form.Even if we had strong social programs a VAT is regressive.

These organisations only matter insofar as they are understood to matter by those within them. They exist because people buy into them and people buy into them because they perceive them as providing some sort of value.

It pays th in taxes.So the government proposes that it will take out massive debt to build a network of highways. On a balance sheet this is a loss.So the government later raises taxes to cover that loan. Now the company pays th of its revenue in taxes. But because of the simplified transport that cost has gone down to th of its revenue.This debt which the company in the end must pay back has led to a reduction in cost of business.In the real world this leads to better profits and so larger retirement accounts like ks so a lowered burden on the elderly it leads to lowered costs for consumers it leads to more savings and property ownership and it leads to more spending. Even beyond that it leads to a more liquid labor market as the ease of moving around helps people not just companies and it leads to higher pay because a company in indiana must compete with a company in California for labor.Sometimes government debt is more than just a balance sheet.

And is nonwage compensation rising? or is the cost of nonwage compensation rising? As in maybe were getting the same amount of healthcare as we have been and thats not growing but the cost to employers to provide that same amount of healthcare is growing meaning technically compensation is rising. gtI think there are always going to be dissatisfied people because frictional unemployment will always exist creative destruction will always exist etc. Its easy to magnify that with the help of the hour news cycle and social media.Ehhhhhh Im not really buying this yet.

Did something happen that cut us off from the better future that today would have been? Or is today as good as it was always gonna get for labor in America no matter what? gtThe departure between total compensation and income noted in the Heritage article I linked earlier is almost entirely due to costs of heathcare benefits taking up more of a share of employees compensation resulting in a decrease in wages even as compensation rises.Is this what I just asked about above?

Another example is middle class welfare like the home mortgage deduction. It would make no sense to give middleincome families both a UBI and the mortgage deduction.

Policymakers suggest this is stimulus providing more incentive for banks to earn additional interest income from lending. Unfortunately as with any other business increased costs mean some combination of banks either absorbing it andor passing it on to their customers in the form of higher rates and feeswhich is what the Stiglitz quote was getting at.In other words not only is it consistent with your description but its worse than doing nothing it actively functions as the opposite of stimulus. Worse still when you consider it in the context of things like increased regulatory capital requirements and liquidity coverage ratios which while necessary as prudential measures also increase costs for banks.Homely analogy You have a restaurant and business is slow. QE is like me coming to your restaurant and adding more tables you didnt ask for and cant get rid of. Negative rates is like a tax levy on every table in your restaurant. Business is still slow but now your costs are higher I pat myself on the back branding my actions as stimulus.

Instrumenting for early viewership with plausibly exogenous weather shocks captured in LASSOchosen instruments we find that shocks to opening weekend viewership are doubled over the following five weekends. Our estimated momentum arises almost exclusively at the local level and we find no evidence that it varies with either expost movie quality or the precision of exante information about movie quality suggesting the observed momentum is driven in part by a preference for shared experience and not only by social learning.Edit a brief summaryThe question is do people go to watch movies because their friendspeers watched it earlier? If so how important is this social network effect?To answer this question holding constant things like movie quality and advertising budget the authors use something random the effect of weather on moviegoing. People watch movies when the weather is bad so opening weekends with bad weather do better than opening weekends otherwise.The punchline For  weatherinduced additional viewers opening weekend we observe almost  additional viewers in the second weekend and almost  in the third.,Economics,d31dxvd,2,t5_2qh1s

Markets do not seem to be competitive when they are necessities aside from food. Im not entirely sure why food escapes that probably because theres so many different types of food and ways to get it. Theres a bunch of reasons why your education costs have gone sky high. The simple solution is free public education competing with private education.How does collective bargaining eliminate price discovery? Where you reach the bargain is where you discover the price to be. If your healthcare cost issue is because of unreasonable behaviour of patent and copyright holders then you dont make copyright and patent legislation stronger you make it weaker.

Arranging the humans into an assembly line allows each to work on a single task much more efficiently reducing slack time and producing the same chair in  hours of unskilled labor time.You can then deemploy half of your laborers and make the same amount of chairs and those laborers still getting paid the same amount will incur half as much wages per chair produced.  The price of chairs then drops by half read  doesnt rise at the same rate as inflation.Your consumersassuming your unemployed chairmakers arent an exceedingly large portion of your consumer basehave all this unspent money now that chairs cost less.  They can afford to pay the wages of the nowunemployed chair makers.  A combination of two things happens More people can afford chairs and people can in general buy more chairs necessitating we retain more than half the chair makers As it turns out it takes just as much human labor to make a cushion as it does to make a chair and so people start buying cushions and the unemployed chair makers become cushion makers.Now you have the same amount of inflated money the same number of labor hours but more products being made.Thats called technical progress.gt Its just a matter of mobilising existing capital and often at a detrimental cost to other forms of capital via pollution. Modern economic theory calls gold mines oil in the ground and other such resources land and they call machines and knowledge capital.  I dont believe in land and capital as such nor as youve stated it.Without technical progress extracting twice the oil or gold from the earth requires expending twice the labor.  If you have twice as many people and your mines can operate at twice the capacity simply by scaling up you get zero wealth increase  the same amount of stuff is produced per capita if we imagine leveling all that stuff out among everyone nobodys gotten any richer.Technical progress allows reduction of effort.  That includes all effort.  When digging iron ore out of the ground your machines belch pollution in the air because theyre chugging through oil which someone had to mine out of the ground and refine by the expense of more oil.  More efficient machines and methods can either reduce the operating time recover more ore per area or the raw fuel consumption burn less fuel per tonne moved or per hour operated involved in digging that ore out of the ground.To your argument that means we actually belch out less shit into the atmosphere per raw unit of ore produced.This is especially true of farming  all agriculture is messy and destructive especially organic farming.  Improvements to chemical fertilizers highlytargeted and fastdegrading pesticides and crop management techniques have allowed highdensity intensive farming.  This provides a number of benefits Much less runoff of fertilizer environmentally damaging to streams this was a problem when the primary fertilizer source was manure instead of chemical salts as wed use a lot of manure and it would wash away before being converted to chemical salts by soil bacteria then ferment elsewhere and pollute the streams Highlyspecific pesticides kill many fewer types of organisms disrupting the local environment less Lowstability pesticides break down in a matter of days rather than hanging around for years polluting the soil and running off into streams Less energy oil expended to pump water for irrigationMuch of this is a benefit of using pesticides and herbicides.  Lesseffective and lessspecific pesticides means more weed problems lower yields more land use and more pesticides fertilization and irrigation over a broader area all the while spreading longlife chemicals that poison beneficial insects and even animals.  Morespecific shortlife pesticides let us farm more in less area and produce less damage per unit area farmed.Those reductions in environmental damage bring with them reductions in food costs by reducing the total labor involved in making food.  This frees up that labor to go make other things.,Economics,d3pqiqr,1,t5_2qh1s

Minimum wage job that required no skill that offered lots of hours worked  every week no over time. Amusement parks rely on lots and lots of cheap labor to function and teenagers are willing and able to fulfill that demand. If amusement parks were suddenly forced to pay living wages for example I know that youre speaking specifically about UBI but I think this holds true here as well many amusement parks would go out of business since it is so labor intensive and could not afford paying workers unless jacking up prices immensely. Is it fair or honest to price labor at a point that would eliminate entire industries or unfairly plague young people looking for employment for some extra spending money? Furthermore the average minimum wage worker for which only a small percentage of laborers work for minimum wage only hold onto that position for  years and moves on to a much better paying job.

7835883,0,t3_4mmg4x,Source Article What Makes Work Meaningful  or Meaningless?Since its behind a subscription wall I want to explain a bit more about this since I think this submission and especially its misleading title arent quite doing the research justice. This study is based on interviews of  workers in various fields. They asked about two different things when did they find their work meaningful and when did they have moments where they wondered why they bothered with it. After analyzing the responses they found  features associated with meaningful work and  features associated with meaningless work. OPs article goes into the  features so Ill keep this part brief. . Individuals tended to experience their work as meaningful when it mattered to others more than just to themselves. .  People often found their work to be full of meaning at moments associated with mixed uncomfortable or even painful thoughts and feelings not just a sense of unalloyed joy and happiness. . No one had a sustained sense that their work was meaningful but rather this was a feeling that came during specific usually quite memorable moments.. Meaningfulness was rarely experienced in the moment but rather in retrospect and on reflection when people were able to see their completed work and make connections between their achievements and a wider sense of life meaning.. Work that is meaningful is often understood by people not just in the context of their work but also in the wider context of their personal life experiences. It should be pretty obvious that bosses typically dont influence those. Its not impossible for bosses to have a role here but they typically dont based on these  interviews.Now on to the juicy part! The  things that tended to make people question the meaningfulness of their work descending order of severity. Disconnect people from their values. One of the most common ways is to focus on the bottom line when the employee values the quality or professionalism of work. Being forced to push out shoddy work to meet a deadline for example really destroys any sense of meaningfulness.. Being taken for granted. For example putting in long hours to accomplish a goal and not even getting any recognition for the fact.. Being given pointless work. People have a sense of what their job should be and when theyre not doing that it can feel pointless. One of the most frequently mentioned examples here was form filling.. Being treated unfairly especially compared to coworkers. . Having their better judgement overruled. If a worker has an idea of how something should be done but their boss tells them to do it his way and ignores their input then that sense of powerlessness can drive away meaning.. Disconnecting workers from supportive relationships. This can be deliberate ostracizing or just through policies that disconnect coworkers from each other. . Unnecessary exposure to risk of physical or emotional harm. From here on the article discusses how to cultivate a sense of meaning in the workplace obviously going beyond the original study here. They say that the first goal to this end should be to avoid the seven deadly sins I just listed above. But going above and beyond to do the exact opposite of those  wont do the trick since the factors that make work meaningful are different than the factors that make work meaningless. Their idea is to create an ecosystem that allows workers to find their work meaningful. Individuals can derive meaning from their job from particular tasks in their work from interactions with others or from the purpose of the organization. Each of those  has nearly a page written about it so Ill be brief here Organizational meaningfulness is when employees understand the  broad purpose of the company. What is the core business and what are the values underpinning it? Honesty is important here if a hospital says they put patients first but then tell nurses to discharge patients as soon as possible then the nurses will realize they hypocrisy and not believe as strongly in the stated purpose of the company.  Job meaningfulness is actually something that most workers experience. And if they dont they will actually go out of their way to make their job meaningful. An example was a sales assistant in a large retail store who listened to lonely elderly customers. All bosses can do in this case is help employees to see how their job is meaningful.  Task meaningfulness is obviously something that cant always be achieved. Not every task is going to fill inherently meaningful and there is no way to change the task to make it meaningful. Once again form filling raises its ugly head here. The best way to deal with meaningless tasks is to manage the context. For example several stonemasons described how their first few months of training involved learning to square the stone chiseling the stone into a perfect square with just a few millimeters of tolerance. They did this over and over again one stone after another until the master mason was satisfied with their abilities. This felt meaningless and frustrating at the time but when they looked back at this time years later they were able to see how important it was in context.  Interactional meaningfulness occurs in two cases when the worker is in contact with whoever benefits from their work and when the worker has positive interactions with hisher coworkers. The authors finish up by combining these  into holistic meaningfulness and then delivering some platitudes about how meaningful work makes us relate as human beings rather than workers or employees and how managing meaningfulness is good for the long term health of a company. The end!tldr  Dick bosses ruin everything but good bosses still have trouble making employees find work meaningful. Letting workers do work they can take pride in that is bigger than themselves or even the company and connecting the jobs to their personal lives in a good way is probably the best way to foster a sense of meaning.,Economics,d3wtk1r,23,t5_2qh1s

Were already giving money to farmers why not get more out of the money we spend? a UBI ignores farmers and thus SNAP cannot be easily reappropriated for UBI. Also rhetorically Simple UBI is a lot simpler than SNAP.

We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of  and proceed in two steps. First using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics we document the patterns of household income consumption and wealth inequality before and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how households in different segments of the wealth distribution were affected by income declines and how they changed their expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence we study several variants of a standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an endogenous crosssectional wealth distribution. Our key finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate shock and it does so if the distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of households with very little net worth that sharply increase their saving i.e. they are not handto mouth as the recession hits. We document that both these features are observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that social insurance policies such as unemployment insurance play in shaping the crosssectional income and wealth distribution and through it the dynamics of business cycles.,Economics,d4d8olz,2,t5_2qh1s

8146018,0,t1_d4vm5w1,My two cents heavily on the left side so choose your amount of salt now For a true free market situation you need not only a minimum wage you need a guaranteed income of some sort. A right not to work. Here is whyYou are already forced to work in order to have a dignified live. But nobody is forced to hire youthey can shop around for somebody cheaper or replace you with a machine. Or just not fill your position. When looking for a job you have none of these options.The  fucked up thing is the bigger the company already the more they can play that game. If a vacancy can be left unfilled for weeks and months because you can move people around pay for contractors etc you have a much stronger negotiation budget. Meanwhile at some point you need that fucking job to pay rentmedical billsfor food. And also small companies might go under because they cant find good replacements at some point.The right to work argument which I think is used as justification for union busting in the states? is a thus a massive amount of doublespeak in my opinion.If you cant live of  hoursweek of your wage then that wage is not enough. If your work does not create enough value then its should be automated or prices need to rise in order to value that work. But if people are desperate enough to do whatever for however long in order to give their kids a dignified life then there is no incentive for these things.

8412585,0,t1_d5su7cz,Its not quite that simple but youre basically right.What happened was math. Some economists really wanted a world where economics wasnt a soft science like psychology. They wanted it to be able to make definitive predictions based on mathematical models rather than more qualitative predictions based on simpler interaction models. This is not a bad thing by any stretch and this kind of experimentation with a field of study is hugely important. In order to make mathematical models possible though they had to simplify the basic atom of their systems the human actor. That simplification was saying Well most of the time humans act in their own selfinterest. This seems like a pretty defensible simplification on its face. So even if some actors acted contrary to their own interests theyd eventually correct themselves because theyd see their money disappearing and the system would converge as though all actors were acting in their own interest. This simplification makes developing mathematical models much easier. And so these models were developed. They had all sorts of new math at their disposal so they could model complex financial systems. And some of these models actually worked pretty well for certain systems like the stock market.The problem is that these models are dreadfully bad at predicting how shocks will be handled because they break down in the face of panic. Weve known for a long time that humans are absolutely awful at risk assessment. And if an actor in your model is bad at risk assessment you cant assume it will act in what is objectively its own interest. Humans instead act in a manner consistent with what they perceive as their best interest and that perception will frequently be at odds with the objective evaluation. So why did these models work well some of the time? Because when they modeled systems that involved sophisticated actors financial analysts traders etc. the assumptions of objective selfinterest held. These actors had the knowledge experience and tools to make the right decisions. But when youre talking about systems involving average people in large quantities predictive power drops as that system becomes more complex. Complexity makes it harder to understand how a system will behave and thus how to act objectively in their own interest.And whats happened over the last few decades in finance? An enormous amount of complexity has been introduced into the system. So even the wellinformed actors arent as wellinformed anymore. So these models have become less and less generally useful. Since the  recession its the less mathy models that have actually worked better. ,Economics,d5t4825,3,t5_2qh1s

8527968,0,t3_4wgabi,I personally believe that one of the best ways to rise out of poverty is to do what generations of people have done for thousands of years  live with extended family. Thing is were trained in our culture not to do that. Were trained to go off and get our own apartment then get a mate then get a new house with that mate. In the not so olden days extended families lived together in the same house for generations. In very wealthy families they will often have massive estates where everyone lives at least some of their lives. In immigrant families you still see this. They live as extended families for many generations and they manage to climb out of poverty. Everyone isnt going to be able to afford their own individual house and were crazy to think that its doable. The best solution to poverty is to live with your parents as long as possible. I know this is probably the last thing people want to hear but its the only real solution. ,Economics,d67k5le,1,t5_2qh1s

The reason large orders move the market is because they indicate a very strong demand for something or a very strong desire to sell something  if the person is actually willing to buy or sell at that price there is no problem whatsoever  however if that person is only sending the order because they know they can cancel it before anyone will be able to fill it that should be illegal.The problem is that we dont have a thought crime division at the SEC or CFTC or any other regulatory agency so for now we just get a token prosecution every couple years to remind people its bad.,Economics,d6ikkzd,0,t5_2qh1s

8767679,0,t1_d7167zb,Yes that is how it works because what you are paying for is a private company to socialize healthcare for you.  They have much more bargaining power than you do as an individual because of all the premiums they collect. Health insurance can be thought of as labor unions except instead of bargaining to keep your job they bargain to keep you alive.  Since everyone is together in needing healthcare theres no reason we dont all collectively bargain as one nation then as a single payer.  This provides the maximum amount of bargaining power to the people whos lives are being bargained for.   Your concern that this more balanced playing field would eliminate incentives in the market is a bit unfounded.  Profits would still be made the market requires them but much more consumer surplus would be returned to the people.  Consumer surplus is where markets move away from incentives to pure greed. The other major argument against it is that the government wouldnt run the system effectively and honestly I dont have much faith in the American government either right now.

It was always legal as a direct tax it could be collected if it was done so proportionally whatever that meansAs I understand it there is no prohibition of any kind of tax in the Constitution but it does say No Capitation or other direct Tax shall be laid unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration . There was some uncertainty as to exactly what is meant by in Proportion apportionment can mean collected in proportion to the population or disbursed in proportion to the population so the constitutionality of  an income tax has changed from one era to another. The question was settled by the th Amendment in  which removed the apportionment constraints.I dont think you will find any declaration on the Constitution that only those taxes specifically mentioned are allowed. The only things it mentions in that line is to distinguish between direct and indirect taxes and how they are handled but doesnt list any.  The Constitution only assigns the authority to levee taxes on the Congress and leaves it at that.  ,Economics,d856fr1,1,t5_2qh1s

9110772,0,t1_d86ie5z,Even the best poets musicians etc often struggled with poverty and some were not even known until after their death. The central difficulty here is that the definition of a true artist is someone who pushes the boundaries of what is valuable and worth living for. Essentially they place themselves above and beyond the mere preference satisfaction of the market. It is those preferences they want to challenge and therefore they cannot make a living satisfying them. That is the exact opposite of their modus operandi. Because the economics mindset has so dominated our society we think that something is valuable only if people value it and people value it only if it is valuable  i.e. a closed loop of artificiality which excludes real invariant value by definition. This is why the values of art and of the market will always be opposed. Because being human was always and will always be more than simply maximizing profit. Regarding the interest rates I think you misunderstand debt. The lender doesnt care if you dont pay all of it back  that money was created out of nothing anyway so its no sweat off their back. There is no incentive to be careful about who you loan to the more you loan the better because its winwin for you. It is nearly always better to be in the position of master lender than slave debtor and the more they can convince people to go into debt for whatever reason the better.

That generally does cause some currency depreciation but that isnt how China or other countries maintain currency pegs. They use Forex reserves mostly treasury bonds and capital controls.gtSo what measure are you talking about when you say stronger than market value? The Chinese government intervenes in the market to artificially increase the value of the currency above what the markets would value it in the absence of that manipulation.

9394961,0,t1_d96nfbt,Wait did I miss something here? Is single payor going to replace all the privately operated health systems with government run institutions? This is certainly not the case... Health systems today in the US get nickel and dimed because of all the middlemen and necessary administration to fight the insurance companies for reimbursement for care that was delivered. All of these excess cost and waste falls to the patient  and very little gets reinvested back to the health system. Competition will still exist under a single payor system but the focus will be shifted on the institutions that are actually providing the care. Systems will compete to design and implement efficient and effective pathways to care and become incentivized to spend more resources on preventative care.  Insurance competition doesnt do much in terms of benefiting patients unless there is some incentive from the govt to do so which is part of the ACA. What we are currently seeing in the industry is that insurance cos still continue to nickel and dime as hard as they can and keep as much revenue and savings as possible for themselves. ,Economics,d96vlfh,-3,t5_2qh1s
9395720,0,t1_d96yxhv,gt The rate for full coverage from an insurance company will be set at a price that the average person can afford. Wrong. Companies dont exist in a vacuum where they are able to charge the maximum the consumer could afford. They exist in a state of competition where they have to constantly undercut each others prices to maintain market share. This competition leads to profit margins declining until theyve almost disappeared.Companies not only compete by cutting their profit share but also by cutting costs through automation. This leads to increasing efficiency and declining costs in any market with competition. So costs will actually be lower in a free market than a governmentrun one as long as some very basic assumptions about economics hold true.,Economics,d96z24g,1,t5_2qh1s
9399653,0,t1_d97ftav,gt Yeah I completely agree A LITTLE deficit spending on the federal level isnt necessarily a bad thing but I dont know if youve checked recently but Id hardly classify the level the American Government is currently running at as little.Theres... not a whole lot of evidence that current levels of deficit spending are having negative effects on the US economy as far as Im aware of. On the contrary theres substantial evidence that deficit stimulus spending has staved off some of the worse outcomes possible from the recession. Happy to take a look at things you think are worth reading however.gt Second do you have a source for the CBO projections being over estimates? The article I read yesterday said while the  budget was slightly under their projections their models didnt account for a  increase in  and could possibly mean trouble for future budgets.Would be interested to see the article you read because it disagrees with what is being said elsewhere at least from HHSCBO. From gt During a media briefing Monday Griffis said the  rates are roughly at the level the Congressional Budget Office forecast when the law was proposed. The initial marketplace rates came in below costs he said. Many companies set prices that turned out to be too low.This is also worth a read Probably also worth noting that marketplace subsidies make up a small percentage  of healthcare subsidies under the ACA. There are bigger pieces moving here even if you get a  increase in the cost of subsidies which probably wont happen it would make up a relatively small portion of ACArelated expenditures.EditAnother sourcegt But HHS argues that next years premiums are in line with CBOs  projections. Drawing from the budget analysts early projections and trending them forward the agency says that CBOs estimate would equate to a benchmark plan cost of  in   very close to the weighted average of  for plans this year.,Economics,d97gzxk,3,t5_2qh1s

It means budget surpluses should be run during periods of robust growth to pay down the national debt until the ratio of debt to GDP reaches the optimal level.  This is politically unpopular because people like to spend money but dislike paying it back and we have a fiat currency and our debt to GDP ratio has not gotten so far out of whack as to cause large devaluation of our currency.

In this way I cant think of the proper level of monetary policy as stimulative but rather just as not contractionary. If monetary policy is too tight and as a result the money supply cant grow along with the economy thats going to hamper growth.

If there is a credible threat that people like me will detect selfdealing and inform the relevant investors or if we detect anticompetitive motives sever enough to risk stakeholder action or regulatory action or whatever THEN you might have an MampA situation which on average creates value for shareholders consumers and the economy at large.

9890700,0,t3_5h20tt,The highlights as I see themgtThis paper is an attempt to understand the economic dynamics of peak oil extraction or more generally peak resource extraction. We use economic production function theory and empirical data to analyze the price dynamics of oil extraction....gtThere is a high probability that the hypotheses on which The Cost Share Theorem is based are not verified. The Cost Share Theorem says that a large cost share corresponds to importance in the economic production function. Theorem . says that increasing cost share is a sign of unimportance in economic production however a large cost share frequently translates into political power. This dynamic can induce governments to embrace counter productive policies as during the stagflation period see Section . the government might support large sectors of the economy which are unimportant in economic production rather than important areas of the economy with smaller cost shares. In our view a small cost share is not a sign of unimportance in the case of energy production it is a sign of what might be called ecodiversity...gtWe believe that the differences in the different periods we studied stem from the importance of oil in the economy that is the size of the partial derivative of economic production with respect to oil varied during the different periods. From  to  oil extraction increased regularly and so was never an impediment to economic growth. In the s oil shocks created irregular supplies and constraints in oil supplies reduced economic growth. Mathematically this is expressed by a larger partial derivative of economic production with respect to oil extraction levels. this period as in the period from  to . This leads us to the following conjectures in accord with . and our empirical resultsgtConjecture .. The principle signal of scarcity of oil production is that pq gt .gtConjecture .. Volatility in the supply of oil leads to increased price dependence on the discreet first and second derivatives of supply.gtThe standard scarcity rent view that lower quantities leads to higher prices can be explained by temporary dependence on the first and second discreet derivatives of extraction levels. After the short term spikes the price stabilizes with economic production adjusting to the new level of extraction. In other words a shortage of important items in economic production ultimately leads to lower prices because economic production contracts reducing demand.gt The authors note that pq gt  is unstable. When extraction levels are increasing pq gt  encourages many actors to enter the extraction business which commonly leads to sharp increases in extraction levels and a price collapse. This occurred in the late s and early s and again from  to  when capital expenses increased at roughly  per year  . If extraction levels are decreasing then pq gt  leads to bankruptcies of higher priced extractors which leads to sharply decreasing extraction levels....gtRising cost share of energy is not benign. It means a loss of diversity in the economy. It means less money for some non core jobs in the economy which leads to lower wages and fewer opportunities in these areas. This is a principle aspect of stagflation. The cost share of food and energy rises in family budgets and less money can be devoted to other areas of the economy....gt ConclusiongtOur analysis and empirical evidence are consistent with oil being a fundamental quantity in economic production. Our analysis indicates that once the contraction period for oil extraction begins price dynamics will accelerate the declinein extraction rates extraction rates decline because of a decrease in profitability of the extraction business.gtOur empirical model for prices can be used by those studying future extraction rates whose models currently do not consider price parameters.We believe that the contraction period in oil extraction has begun and that policy makers should be making contingency plans.

This limits Bitcoin to about  transactions per  minutes.We do have altcoins that can help alleviate this issue but most of them arent taken seriously and the smaller ones become quite vulnerable to  attacks.Theres also the issue that cryptocurrency is inherantly wasteful and damaging to the environment.

They dont process transactions they essentially just compete on meaningless guess and check style math equations to decide who gets to publish the block.

So thats a pretty significant difference in measurement right there and suggests that the  vs. almost  difference may not be that significant. Although it is true that the most likely time for released offenders to reoffend is in the their first year.But these comparisons also ignore the fact that there is less crime generally in many of these countries with low recidivism rates which also makes it difficult to see what approaches work in reducing recidivism. If offenders come from a society with a crime rate half say that of the US and upon release reoffend at a rate half that of US released offenders is it really because the rehabilitation that they received was twice as good? Or is it because they both came from and were released back into a society where crime is much less common.,Economics,dc3pq98,2,t5_2qh1s

People will always get sick so they will always have customers. The only risk is in messing up the prices or the costs. at which point you can still sell the buildings.Drug companies are executing a business model that occasionally works big but usually doesnt work at all. thats the definition of high risk right there. buy the longshot idea that some publicly funded professor came up with. . spend years and billions of dollars on developing the idea into a drug. This is the part thats the most expensive and it isnt covered by public funds hardly at all..

Certainly if you grow the money supply too fast you get inflation you only have to make sure you have enough growth.Now the reason you need steady growth in the backing reserve and not just the multiplicative credit based dollars on top of it is thisWhen you create all of the new money that way the gross private debt can mount up relative to GDP if the multiplier effect of those created dolalrs is not high enough  this is what happened before  and . Throughout the th century credit was mostly able to accommodate changing amounts of new gold mining without significant inflation or deflation. In  we left the gold standard because credit could not accommodate the amount of dollars that had been needed. The roaring s ended when the private sector did not want to borrow any more money in the aggregate. This demand shock tanked everything.So to avoid the necessitation of runaway accumulation of private debt that leads to a crash in order to grow the money supply so as to maintain full employment you have to provide a steadily growing concrete monetary basis of some sort for credit expansion.,Economics,ddmm9yv,1,t5_2qh1s

While China killed millions with terrible policies en masse sadly India had killed way more through neglect  sectarian violence etc. India is a wretched place compared to China particularly for the poor who live on  cents a day or less It may be fun for you to have organic growth whatever that means but dont compare a small dip in the Chinese export oriented economy with the utter sadness of the poor in India. ,Economics,ded0p6w,5,t5_2qh1s

When you include local tax revenues you are looking at just higher than  Billion per year excluding the less tangible subsidy on the federal student loan prgoram.You are correct that it is a smaller percentage than primarysecondary education.  I was stating that with the excess cost growth in higher education from federal student loans it is impossible for states to fund at the same level as a percentage of total higher education spending in perpetuity.  State budgets grow at a rate roughly equal to GDP growth and higher education has been growing at approximately double that rate.

I get that its not literally the simplest possible application but its still pretty standard Econ  stuff.gt Using your logic why not increase the minimum wage to  or ?Id say the  range sounds about right to me. Thats about where wed be if the minimum wage had kept up with productivity growth since the s. But Ill respond to your point that yes obviously you could set the minimum wage so high that it would start to cause problems. I dont support a  minimum wage or anything.The big issue here is that employers have a huge bargaining advantage over their employees. Its trivial for an employer to fire one of their many employees. Its a huge deal for an employee to leave their only job. So you end up with employers able to get incredibly good deals in terms of what percentage of the value that each employee is creating that theyre able to keep for themselves. The point of minimum wage laws is to intervene so that employers cant push their advantage beyond a certain level. This is better accomplished with unionized workforces that are able to bargain on more equal terms with their employers without the need for crude government intervention but given that we havent been in that situation for a while minimum wage laws are a lot better than nothing.,Economics,dfixb33,-2,t5_2qh1s

11715678,0,t1_dgnyhvb,No. Read the article you linked and Soltas commentary on it. James Sherk demonstrated that if you change your set of assumptions in particular if you include payments to workers in supervisory roles and use a different method of accounting for inflation you can explain away the productivity difference. This actually isnt very interesting because these farleft people were not concerned with mean income growth to begin with they wont be amused by you pointing out that supervisors have captured productivity growth. Their exact gripe was that supervisors had captured too much of productivity growth.Note that Sherk specifically suggests improving the skills of the least productive workers. Since you cant really tell who is the most productive within a firm looking in from the outside its really just a difference in viewpoint. The Heritage Foundation hardly an untarnished example of ivory tower academia looks at this from the viewpoint that workers earning above the median have driven all the productivity growth and thus earned all the benefits. This is not a perception everyone shares.,Economics,dgo01zv,1,t5_2qh1s

11726611,0,t1_dgor4c4,gt And the bang for buck in terms of health outcomes per dollar spent on healthcare pretty perfectly correlates with how government controlled the system is.Not really. Its actually fairly all over the place. The US is the worst off in terms of spending but some countries with heavily nationalized systems actually end up paying a lot for them or end up with other costs like long wait times for medical services.It should also be noted that outside of the developed world a lot of the developing world gets to sponge off the developed world and gets much lower drug prices. This isnt because their systems are better it is because they couldnt afford the medications at all at their real prices and the drug companies dont want them violating patent law to produce cheap knockoffs.gt What point could you possibly try to make with this? Yes obviously every action has some cost at least opportunity cost. So if you stick to that definition its incoherent to ever describe anything as free. So maybe just assume that when someone is using the word free that theyre using it in the way everyone actually uses it to mean something is being distributed to people without them having to pay for it.The problem is that we do have to pay for it via taxes instead of insurance.It isnt free. It is just being paid for via a different route.If you say we want to raise taxes by kfamily to pay for health care people are going to be much less enthusiastic.,Economics,dgp8prq,1,t5_2qh1s
