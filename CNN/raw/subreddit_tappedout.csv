Once youve got everything from the boxes that use Egg X then youre going to need the things in the box that uses Egg Y. You gain Egg Y a lot slower since you dont get them from tasks and much less from rabbits so you can use the baskets in other peoples Springfields to trade X for Y.Edit  And I believe you can get them from the rabbits dropping them.

I just find this event and their attitude toward the complaints completely baffling. And yes at times infuriating. This isnt a freebie game  people have spent hundreds on the one event alone. That begins to seem more like a rigged poker machine.Even if the text in question in this topic was not meant to make fun of our complaints or our supposed laziness or joblessness and I wasnt sure if I might have been over reacting to it which is why I asked what I did at the end of the OP  something the trolls completely missed their lack of response in not fixing anything says the same thing loud and clear. IMO.I cant do freedonuts because reasons.Ill miss the subreddit more than the game at this point.

1701534,0,t3_2dq78a,I believe we are just days away from an update that could be considered major.  What exactly well see Im unaware. I do still believe that it will tie in to the  day marathon that begins on Thursday...but other than a feeling that it will have something to do with the marathon Im not sure what to expect.Perhaps an easy way to travel down memory lane and introduce content from older seasons.However if the plethora of issues regarding the game arent also addressed with the update I feel like it may be time for me to stop playing.  Since the Stoncutters event all I do is login daily just to keep my bonus streak going.  It takes about  minutes to login to tap for  seconds.I have run out of land to put any of the new items EA wants us to pay for.  I could cram everything together like EA does in their Other Springfield but I want it to look like a town...not a group of buildings squished next to other buildings with no apparent reasoning or planning.MicrosoftSkype recently made the decsision to stop supporting older devices with their Android app.  Hopefully EA will follow suit shortly.Its nice that EA has focused so much development for content on this game.  Giving us frequent updates and unexpected special events.  But at this point the best update I could get is not content new items characters or buildings.  Its making the game more stable playable like it once was and addressing the fact that even though EA wants us to buy buy buy weve long run out of room to place place place.,tappedout,cjtn2yb,2,t5_2v7cj

They knew that the Monorail Event would bring some players back and they launch it with a multitude of bugs and sending thousands of players into the land of the black screen. They should have tested this more thoroughly before release. There hasnt been as bad a messup like this since Act  of the Christmas event last year. I suggest EA doing a limited test out with some players for future events to see if the gameplay is working and then getting feedback before releasing. Im also shocked EA has taken this long to try and sort out a fix. Hopefully theyll compensate for the players who got locked out.,tappedout,cud5ihr,4,t5_2v7cj

5271048,0,t3_3n6ys3,No but I have all the characters so that helps. I think Ive gotten better at it though. Heres how Instead of starting at the top of the depot lists I start at the bottom. Thats where the characters are who cant also collect garbage. Then as soon as the garbage goes below  I stop assigning at the depots and have everyone do a garbage run.  While theyre doing that I assign the rest of the nongarbagecollectors and then itll usually only take me one more round of garbage collecting to be full again.  This way I always have plenty of characters available to get me the garbage I need instead of having to wait around for ages while just Homer and Ray Patterson do their thing.  So far Ive been able to get the donuts within the first half of each week and this week I dont think I ever got down below  garbage.Edit I didnt get it done in the first half of this week it took me well over  days.,tappedout,cvlfp2e,2,t5_2v7cj

5865378,0,t3_3vkc9n,There are ways to earn donuts and EA seems to be a bit more generous with giving them out lately.  You can get donuts from Sideshow You and the Railyard.  You get extra donuts after youre at the max level and continue to level up.  Special events give out donuts.  There was the opportunity to earn at least  donuts for the Halloween event.  You get random donuts when visiting friends.  And the Mystery Box gives out donuts now and then.  Ive been playing for three years and I currently have  donuts and didnt pay for any of them.  I just spent  of them to get Disco Stu so I was over  before that.  I have plenty of other premium items too.  Some from donuts some from the Mystery Box.

7958202,0,t3_4o926l,Ill go first. It was an alright event the content and decorations we got were nice in size and a perfect fit for small areas of our Springfield we struggle to fill and also something potentially fit for the Squidport  which has been lacking in new content recently. The Insanity Mode is a nice addition to gameplay and tapping the little tortoises is kinda fun with the added bonus on getting those Pharmaceuticals that take ages to harvest at Johns Pharmaceuticals. The minievent like most for me ended quite early and for quite a few days I didnt even realise it was still going on. It would have been nice for the coyote to have been the final prize or part of it though. However the animation of Homer having eaten the Insanity Pepper made up for it though as we dont often see new animations for small new pieces of content. Great concept for a minievent but a bit lacking in what was on offer including the premium content.Also I spell it chilli. Not sure if its the British way or not.,tappedout,d4aks68,2,t5_2v7cj

With the constant expansions only on the east side it makes design and layout more awkward for longtime players especially with a lot of big andor sprawling buildings and event decorations. And we also need TWO strips of ocean.

8784154,0,t3_50fjpo,Try to build the higher value items first as much as you can eg save parts for a day or two to get a hover car or mobile dome.  You might get to the end of the event or act and only need a few more points to complete but have used up all of your tulips and road signs and lack sufficient time to earn enough parts.  Most of them max out at between  so max out highest cost early on.  Max out building so the convert to future bucks sooner.Also go for the buildings that pay out as opposed to vanity items.  From the super hero challenge I redeemed about  sets of the Zenith towers so every three hours I have  buildings paying out. I am planning to spend all my future bucks on townhouses and office buildings to do the same.,tappedout,d73owya,6,t5_2v7cj

10761465,0,t3_5tyc6n,Actually located on opposite ends of the map these are my two gems along the Springfield river. First I used D effects to create the infamous Springfield dam. Fortunately for Bob there are no pipes extruding from the wall this time so he can enjoy his life as a mutant without worries.The second part has annoyed me for a while now not being able to link riverlake tiles with the actual sea. A causeway always appeared as the simplest idea but I think the first time I tried the concrete walls werent even in the game yet and it didnt look that great especially with all that beach left. I think I now managed to create a decent generator building and used the ice walls again like I did with the dam in the top picture as foam to cover up the pier I needed to build walls to cover up the last unusable row of beach.,tappedout,ddpyruc,9,t5_2v7cj

11071303,0,t1_demsdur,Thanks!And Im right there with you.  I would have preferred some taxiways along with more runway pieces to be honest.  That way some planes could have been put in front of the terminals instead of having them right against the runway and the extra runway pieces could be used as a parallel runway.  And when I was trying to  setup the approach lights to try to mimic real world approach lights would have been nice to have a couple other colors to work with.Also you can get new monorail track pieces each week if you do the recycling center objectives  accessed via the Dilapidated Rail Yard.  ,tappedout,demx74e,3,t5_2v7cj
