8924026,0,t3_52eutn,They actually can. In the setting book for Hell on Earth Classic it has a new edge Veteran of the Weird West instead of Wasted West like the core book. One of the things they suggest on how you are able to have lived so long is the fact youre a huckster. I then proceeded to scour the book to see if it mentioned rules for actually playing a Huckster. It didnt. I remember there being rules though somewhere. Something about it was harder because the bigger manitous were out and about because of the bombs and they were harder to control.Ah! According to the other mention here of the Junker book once I found the Junker book it is indeed in there.The important bits areHaving an aptitude of  or greater in a hex confers no advantage as far as resisting backlash. Finally all backlash rolls suffer a  modifier.As for how youd translate that to Reloaded Im unsure.,Deadlands,d7kjc88,2,t5_2uui8

The world hasnt changed much apart from being about  years in the future. The Rail Wars are the new thing that drives the world and setting and something that works well in the background. I would stress to your players to play with what their character knows rather than what they know about the way things work.You dont have to worry too much about being hugely true to the written lore as long as you maintain the weird west theme. It should be mysterious so dont worry about havingtrying to explain everything. Savage Worlds is perfect for fast paced combat and its one of its major selling points your average guy dies after a single gunshot most of the time.In the opener to one session I had my players on a train they end up agreeing to protect a lawyer who is taking evidence to the local courthouse...cue gunfight in train riding fight as they charge through town fight on courthouse steps shootout in the courthouse and finally hostage face off when bandits gave got the judge.This took about half an hour but was incredibly fast paced and kept the players on their toes the entire time.I would suggest an opening fight so everyone knows what they can do one towards the middle as they start to discover the plot etc and then a closing fight with some tougher enemies to send them home in a big way. The first fight should be statted so the players tear through the enemy which serves the added benefit of lulling them into false confidence  Throw a little more supernatural into the second fight so the players have to use their powers  find weak spots etc but ultimately should win.Then the final fight you can go as brutal as you wish depending on if you want a heroic ending or a horror style everybody dies althiugh if you go this route it needs to be managed well so the players still feel like they have a chance...and they might just pull it off with some luck anyway. To add to this id make sure the player characters all know each other and have a reason to do the thing otherwise you will inevitably lose a ton of time to characters talking amongst themselves. Finally  dont be afraid to pressure your players  If they dont know what they want to do when there card comes up move into the next person and let them back in when they know.  it sounds cool but Id only do it if you can match stuff for the other players as otherwise it might be a little odd just giving one person a card case. Could always do a chip for each character which would be a nice momento. Finally and I dont want to sound patronising remember the simple stuff we all forget at times that really enhance the RP such as when you ask a player what they want to do use their characters name keep them as locked into the world as you can...if its a one shot you want it to all be about the game and not waste a ton of time with OOC chats etc.Hope some of this helps Im happy to bounce ideas about and offer any insights you need. I have a ton of experience with reloaded and its my current game...sounds great and dont forget to post a link .,Deadlands,d8jv6th,3,t5_2uui8
