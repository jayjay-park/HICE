1710163,0,t1_cjum36v,Yeah I started a film class with Nick but ended up leaving upon the realization that I had taken practically the same class with Jason Mauro who I love btw. Nick seems like a cool guy though very young and very smart. ,UNF,cjuq7x5,1,t5_2sg54

11529405,0,t3_649us9,Ive lived in Jacksonville for pretty much my entire life and to me its pretty normal not much special. But then again the novelty has probably worn off after about  years. Definitely take advantage of the beaches and riverside areas though theyre both pretty cool. You definitely need a car to get around though. The year I spent in the dorms at UNF were nice but I would highly recommend getting involved and going to all those little floor events and joining clubsmaybe even living in the hall. I didnt meet a ton of people so I didnt really get the college experience I was hoping for it was a bit of a letdown. Dont be afraid to put yourself out there and dont sit around thinking that making friends will just happen when youre in a new place and with a bunch of people you know nothing about. UNF isnt that much different from high school on the premise that the professors are nice and the classes are small. The work is harder and more serious though but by the end of your first semester youll get into the groove of things. ,UNF,dg2uyza,2,t5_2sg54
11604972,0,t3_65gp2i,I think its silly to get upset over it. I think the people who have been able to back in previously and actually do it might be upset but if youre told from the time you start that you cant back in most people wont care. Im curious how theyll stop students from buying one pass and registering all of their friends on it though. The whole savings of this project gets wiped out if  students who would normally buy their own just start sharing instead.,UNF,dgbflsz,1,t5_2sg54
