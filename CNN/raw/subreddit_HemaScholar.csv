9296095,0,t3_57rqox,Alright this is just a bit of fun but I want to talk about polearms this week. Somebody over on raskhistorians posted a question about twoman pikes  i.e. really long weapons that would require a twoman team to wield. Im pretty sure those never existed historically  I cant see how a twoman pike would be better than two soldiers with regular pikes in pretty much every circumstance...and back in the period where soldiers supplied their own arms I cant see guys going in halfsies for that kind of weapon.  However I found out twoperson pikes do exist today in the form of a specialist tool for firefighting which is kind of neat.,HemaScholar,d8uchpa,1,t5_3e28n
