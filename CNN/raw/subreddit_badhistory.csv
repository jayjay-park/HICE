Projective geometry used to plot accurate maps and perspective correct art. Meanspeed theorem.. Isolation of Arsenic.. The dialectic.. Syllogism..

121177,0,t1_ces7q96,Well that is a really interesting point but I view it differently. Paxton and I agree with him here is making the claim that fascism and the fascist party necessarily establishes parallel institutions. It is not enough that there is a struggle between factions in government.A struggle within the Republican party is still a struggle within the normative government.Fascism here demands that the fascist party or organization has power in its own right coexistent with that of the normative.  So the difference here for the sake of example is that Wacko Birds are creating an alliance between Republicans and some other group. Rather they are Republicans trying to shift the party to the right actually challenging the normative elites directly. Now this all may seem to be a distinction without a difference but you need to ask Whats left? Say Tea Party Senators take over control of the Republican party. They may alter the platform to reflect ultranationalist policies and if it were possible they may win an election. However would that regime be fascist?

E.g. carbon  unstable vs carbon stable. With carbondating for example we know that carbon  doesnt form on earth but is constantly falling onto earth from space. So by examining the carbon in an object we can get an approximate time for when the material was formed.One of the criticisms of radiological dating is that theres no reason to believe that the introduction of unstable isotopes to earth is constant. This is a valid critique but by comparing against other dating methods scientists create callibration curves used to correct for this.As far as strata there are lots of reasons that the strata in one area might be out of order but its sort of a casebycase thing and saying its all a load of bullshit! is a disingenuous way of dealing with the problem.The arguments prop up known caveats with the methods as fatal flaws in much the same way Jesus mythers pretend the doctored reference in Josephus is an argument against the historicity of Jesus.,badhistory,cf3jx2y,1,t5_2wo26

But really when you get into it economics cultural differences and politics between the North and South were still largely slaverybased differences. The South required slave labor for its agrarian economy to be as profitable as possible. Slaves themselves were also worth massive capital and slave owners would take a huge hit if their property no longer belonged to them. Southern whites  even the poor ones  had an underclass to feel superior to and were terrified of a slave revolt. Poor Southern whites also sought to become slave holders. That was the ambition. Congressional tensions between the North and South were heightened by the fact that Southerners were overrepresented in Congress and the Electoral College due to the ths Compromise so Southerners actually had had unfair advantage in politics.,badhistory,cf3x5l9,3,t5_2wo26

It wasnt until a few years later when the damn History Channel actually set me straight about it. I would assume that for most of us nonhistorians that subpar teaching in high school would be the reason for it. Teachers that dont keep up with advancements in the field books that are woefully out of date and administrators that see no reason to update any of this because history never changes all come together to pound these misconceptions into peoples heads at the last time they are actually forced to learn any of this stuff. Quick edit I dont mean to sound like Im insulting all teachers here just speaking from experience. My history teachers in high school were interesting to say the least. The one who covered medieval history was paid more as the football coach than as a teacher whereas the one who covered modern history while too fat to regularly get out of his chair gave an amazing overview of both the first and second world wars that covered a surprising amount of detail. ,badhistory,cf71iib,15,t5_2wo26
256481,0,t3_1wxct9,Not to diss on your post but dont link to the Daily Caller. Theyre a terrible source for anything especially politics. They lie consistently in their headlines and are barely credible as a clickbait scandal rag so much as a relevant commentary on what any selfdescribed feminist has to say. This article just bleeds snarky malice about the people its reporting on. Its not even original reporting just summarizing the Daily Dot article that originally reported the story. All the Caller adds are some lovely turns of phrase such as feminist sympathizers and the convenient removal of any of the context included in the Daily Dot article. That context includes the fact that only  of Wikipedias editors are women and a third of all women editors have reported being verbally assaulted or treated poorly by male colleagues on the site and that the whole project is part of Wikimedias attempt to recruit more female editors to create a healthier less insulated culture for the site.The history is still wrong regardless of the source but there was no reason to choose an article that cherrypicks the worst quotes to make the interviewee sound like a total fool rather than just someone speaking offthecuff about a topic they arent expert in during an interview devoted to more current issues. It might seem like a small thing but choosing the Caller article over the original Daily Dot source informs the tone of the discussion here. You even copied their tone in your post stating this is a group that wants to rewrite wikipedia to make it less masculine which makes it sound like some kind of outside interference.

Norway was the weaker partner in a union with Denmark until the Napoleonic wars when it was lost to Sweden.

Namely that Jews are disloyal to their home country because they are ethnically different that Jews hold to much sway in international finance and business that they are cynically exploitative of their own persecution and that they are christ killers. These are all charges that have been leveled at Jews and used as excuses for various acts of persecution. So while you could apply these questions to other ethnicities it would lack the same historical and contextual relevance. For a thought experiment consider the different ways you react to these two statements Black people commit too much crime and White people commit too much crime. Although we have only changed the ethnicity of the subject group the cultural associations with the phrase are completely different. I understand your concerns with leading questions in a survey but this survey is actually designed to catch the way in which people react to these questions within their cultural context.

907885,0,t3_24havw,The theory that supports the Sadducean Hypothesis mainly relies on QMMT aka the Halachic letter. QMMT outlines the same theories the Sadducees apparently held as depicted in the Mishnah. However no one is certain most scholars agree on the Essene hypothesis because there is more evidence for them but in reality the Essenes are the most elusive sect for historians today and little is known about them other than the writings of Pliny Josephus and a scattering of other documents. I personally follow the Essene Hypothesis but I believe that many ideas that are held about them have yet to be fully developed. Namely while the graves at Qumran contain mostly men most of the graves have yet to be explored and many of the documents at Qumran detail laws and rules dictating the correct ways of dealing with women and children. Also another badhistory surrounding Qumran there is a professor in Sydney that believes the Qumran community was actually the heart of Jesus story. She believes Jesus was the Teacher of Righteousness the founder of the sect at Qumran from around  BCE and John the Baptist was the Wicked Priest the rival of the Teacher of Righteousness who was actually believed to be the High Priest at Jerusalem at the time If you know Biblical Hebrew Wicked Priest is actually a pun of High Priest requiring only a small change. This theory is easily disproven by the archeological evidence and dating of the documents of Qumran because her theory revolves around Qumran writings being written later than what is the consensus. ,badhistory,ch7hdh8,2,t5_2wo26

A couple of countries leave and the fragmenting EU coupled with militaries failing to handle their internal wars leads to a lot of people distrusting the Euro and a lot of additional economic problems. My main issue is looking at the whole outline for multiple decades and going Stagnation Russian separatists the rise of the far right Greek civil chaos and Spanish terrorists...  jesus can shit really get this bad this fast? but on the other hand... its hard to demote powers like France and Germany that quickly without a ridiculously perfect storm.

Why does spotting demagogues like Hitler require knowing that Hitler did good stuff too? It seems to me that it would be far more useful to know what kinds of things a demagogue does the tactics they use to gain control how they influence the media etc. Knowing that Hitler liked dogs isnt going to help anybody spot the next dictator in the making.Youre worried about teens not realizing that Hitler was human and thus thinking that such a thing couldnt happen again. I dont think those two things are connected at all. Thinking that someone like Hitler cant come to power is not a result of not seeing him as human. Its a function of knowing what happened in Nazi Germany and thus being able to spot signs in our own times. None of that requires that we look for the good things that Hitler did.In fact my worry is just the opposite.

Who knows.orChristianity is an amalgamation of Mithras worship. Even though Mithras worship was not really much of a thing in Palestine.Jesus Do RealIn the st part of the st century A.D. there was an itinerant preacher named Jesus of Nazareth. He was an apocalyptic preacher who was executed by the Romans. Some of his followers continued his work which grew into the religion Christianity.Oh and contemporary for ancient history values of contemporary writers mention Jesus of Nazareth as a real person. The textual and historical evidence is practically overwhelming in support of the Jesus Do Real crowd. To make the Jesus Dont Real argument youd have to apply doublestandards to your evidence and twist the historical narrative to support your position.

You said Cambridge and the publishing journal endorse these positions. Thats simply not how it works. Support doesnt even hint at consensus. You dont need a consensus to be published. If that was the case it would be almost impossible to have controversy in academia. Further just because a peer deems something worthy of publication doesnt imply agreement either. Often methodology or the information mentioned is what matters more. Scholars can easily endorse an article for publication while still disagreeing with its thesis.

The loader actually has quite a bit of space because he needs it to work the gun.In WW ammunition was stored all over the place inside the tank and that is the main reason why tanks during the war all caught fire so readily. By  however American tanks like the Sherman all had their ammunition stored in the floor beneath the turret as it was found that that was the safest place for it. The Sherman also had what was called wet storage which basically meant that all the ammunition was stored in boxes that were surrounded by water.

The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game.gtIn the most widespread version of the game the players struck the ball with their hips although some versions allowed the use of forearms rackets bats or handstones.

2589202,0,t1_cmw4dt0,gt Frankly the South didnt have much of an incentive to industrialize agriculture was making them rich. Cotton accounted for HALF of all US exports before the Civil War. Why would largescale slave owners invest in a risky business when they could guarantee huge profits doing almost no work?Im always a bit wary of this kind of argument. Just that many people in the south were rich from one thing doesnt mean they other people in the south or people in the north willing to move there had no incentive to invest in industry. Obviously theres money to be made from processing cotton otherwise the north wouldnt have paid to get cotton shipped to them and process it. There must be some reason why northern mills won out against southern ones which judging from other responses here did exist to some extent. Maybe they faced lower borrowing costs or lower wages maybe the transport cost of the final product was high enough to warrant a move closer to the final market assuming more people lived in the north maybe policies in the north were more conducive to industry. The latter part could come close to your statement actually if a certain policy is a tradeoff between agriculture and industry a rich slaveowning class would force the government to favor agriculture while in the north industry would win. But quite often statements like yours are no less of a simplificiation than missing the distinction between the two IRs.Im hoping you know more about a possible reason here as it definitely is interesting subject matter.,badhistory,cmwjnio,5,t5_2wo26

The Aztecs would select a guy to act as a deity impersonatoravatar who would then live like that god for a fixed period of time and then was sacrificed.

What it means equally implausible events? How you measure equality in historical facts? Their motto is as historicaly accurate as possible which means they try to be historical in things they can and they are not historical in things that are important for gameplay and which makes the game fun. Allowing common blacksmith to become someone important and having a horse? Important for gameplay hence good reason for breaking historical accuracy although he will never become a noble he will never posses a land house etc.. Adding a black farmer? Ridiculous historicaly inacurate and without any value for gameplay. You say these things are equily implausible I would seriously argue about that. One thing makes sense the other one doesnt.gtWell no...Im just saying that he should be consistent in how he applies historical accuracy. If he wasnt using that as a shield against criticism I wouldnt have cared. Im still waiting for any relevant evidence showing that a single black person lived in that era in Bohemia. gtGood thing thats not what Im arguing.No thats exactly what you are arguing.  Your wordsgtFrankly any game where orphaned blacksmiths sons end up anywhere but a shallow grave or maybe a monastery is pushing it and I cant see how adding a visiting Moorish noble or Malian mercenary would be inconsistent with the level of accuracy it maintains.In other words your game is not  historicaly accurate anyway so fuck it and include token moorish noble to a Bohemia countryside even if it is nonsense because diversity!gtThat would be valuable context.

Fact is that owning a slave was just like owning a car and when you are not happy with a car you would trade it....not harm it!

Id even say that the theory about the central hallway seems especially plausible since the huge stones above the burial chamber would have required special consideration.As for my criticsm Its been a while since I did a lot of reading on Egypt so Im having trouble with sources but I know that the remains of ramps have actually been found with one example being Pyramid of Senusret I. There are other examples but Google is not helping me find them all I get are wild theories.As my search results have reminded me people tend to disproportionally focus on the Giza pyramids rather than the many other examples. I think its pretty plausible that larger pyramids just used larger versions of the methods applied elsewhere. Similarly if internal ramps were a viable method why have no examples been found anywhere else? Even in the most thoroughlyinvestigated pyramid of all they remain undiscovered  despite archaeologists apparently knowing where the entrances are. Its hard to present counterevidence but the internal ramp hypothesis seems so simple to prove its strange that it hasnt been and I plan to wait for some more conclusive evidence.I wouldnt say its badhistory but its not good history either.,badhistory,cpw6jd0,7,t5_2wo26

4094349,0,t3_3789pu,When I was going through elementary school late s I distinctly remember being taught that the name Idaho was an Indian word that basically meant beautiful lake or land of Its not. It was a made up word by an early lobbyist for the state. I dont think they teach that bit of badhistory anymore but up until the late searly s they did. Heres an excerpt from a s textbook about the namegtIdaho is a Shoshoni Indian exclamation. The word consists of three parts. The first is Ee which in English conveys the idea of coming down. The second is dah which is the Shoshoni stem or root for both sun and mountain. The third syllable how denotes the exclamation and stands for the same thing in Shoshoni that the exclamation mark ! does in the English language. The Shoshoni word is Eedahhow and the Indian thought thus conveyed when translated into English means Behold! the sun coming down the mountain.Some more bad historyetymology. The city of Pocatello which is where I attended elementary school supposedly takes its name from a Shoshone chief of the same name who signed a treaty with the Union Pacific railroad to grant right of way access. There was a real chief who lived during this time and he was a Shoshone leader but his name wasnt Pocatello. The name Pocatello doesnt show up in the record until  years after his death. The chiefs name was actually Tondzaosha. ,badhistory,crmzbzq,4,t5_2wo26

Here are two books Ive read on the subject  by Charles C. Mann which I mentioned in the article and The conquistadors a Very Short Introduction by Matthew Restall and Felipe FernndezArmesto. In the end going without something is not a major weakness if its useless where you are. For instance horses are a huge pain in the ass if youre trying to scale a mountain. If you break your sword or your crossbow in the Yucatn youre not going to replace or repair it easily.

Public opinion in France and Britain was crucial to preventing them from negotiating an end to the war but to satisfy their need for cotton entrepreneurs developed other sources in India and Africa and I see no reason why those sources wouldnt have been developed even without the Civil War to avoid American tarrifs if nothing else.What gets lost are the th th and th Amendments and the whole civil rights movement. As OP said the racial caste system still exists.Even then I think it seems unlikely that the US could have gone through both World Wars and the Cold War with slavery still intact.

4673620,0,t1_cth8wp9,If I remember correctly one of the codex pages you can collect in Assassins Creed II is his thoughts on religion. It clarifies that he doesnt like monotheism calling it surely the greatest lie ever told sic SPOILER given that the setting has Roman gods being inspired by specific entities existing within the setting and the fact that early Judaism and Christianity used pieces of Eden illusory devices on multiple occasions this seems to be an accurate view within the lore. He has some preference for polytheistic religions where gods were more personified cosmological forces of nature than makers of arbitrary moral rules sic thinks assigning cause of all processes to a single entity is irrational and thinks that monotheistic religion has reinforcement and punishment mechanisms which are severely clouding peoples judgment presumably he was talking about dichotomous afterlives for good and evil. Given that he yearns for people to once more embrace a more rational view sic has been studying preChristian polytheistic religions and what was common before monotheism the implication is that he is perhaps a polytheist maybe one of a Roman variety given the setting.

I dont think anyone was killed in the Stonewall Riots either but I could be mistaken. The comics use of violence is obviously intended to include sociallyeconomically disruptive organized behavior which would encompass your examples of nonviolence as well.Youre also cherrypicking examples ignoring the broader context of nonviolent movements accompanied by violence or the threat of violence elsewhere and skirting the issue of whether oppressed people have a right to violent resistance irrespective of its effectiveness relative to nonviolence but thats all beyond the scope of the comic.,badhistory,ctozqz8,56,t5_2wo26

4798542,0,t1_ctyy8xi,gtCocoa was a true prestige itemAgain we are talking about the origins of cannibalism in Aztec society  an institution that the upper class advocated facilitated and perpetuated.  That the lower classes were not consuming chocolate in large quantities is not relevant precisely because they werent the ones consuming human flesh or asserting the moral framework that said it was OK to do so.gtin that the major premise of the study in question is that lysine isoleucine and a couple other amino acids present in very high quantities in maize compete for the same metabolic enzymes that transport and process trp.Nope.  As I previously stated chocolate offers a good balance between competing amino acids and tryptophan.  The overall quantity of nutrients an individual digests is the result of ALL foods they consume  not just the one staple food the authors look at.gtThere have been plenty of links between serotonin and aggression.Not in question.  I specifically stated that research into the matter has been contradictory  some studies have suggested a leak some have not.  Cherry picking is not good science.  gt Youre also missing the point of the second major hypothesis that mesoamericans diet may have led them unconsciously towards anthropophagy in order to attenuate it rising trpLNAAs value by means of human proteins when it became too strong.No I am not.  I directly rejecting the notion that a dietary imbalance existed at all.  Since the second premise is contingent on the validity of the first being done with the first is sufficient.gtThe dietary deficiencies may have manifested in cannibalistic tendencies simply to alleviate the deficiencies not that a serotonin deficiency led them to rage which resulted in cannibalism.gtAnd the staple was corn.It was A staple. One of several foods which served as basis for the Aztec diet.  Your assertion is akin to suggesting that because wheat was a staple of the European diet we can just sort of ignore other staples.gtIn a city of millions food sources like amphibians and reptiles are insignificant unless used as livestock which they werent.Tenochtitlan was a trade city that was almost entirely reliant on food imports.  Amphibians reptiles and the other sources of animal protein which you have arbitrarily decided to ignore were widely traded and brought into the city as part of their tribute demands.  Historical documentation and archaeological evidence both verify the extensive exploitation of lacustrine food sources and trade in other foodstuffs including ones I didnt mention.  Your assertion here is nothing more than personal speculation and you have alluded to that on this post already.gtCruelty doesnt play into this.Starting on page  of the article under the section Serotonin and Behavior read me the title of point D. page gtthe question is whether subsequent nonritualized cannibalism occurred. That is by no means what this article is about.  The article explicitly statesIn this work we examine Aztec religion starting with the cultural materialist and the neurobiological aspect which has been little studied as yet while bearing in mind the other viewpoints with the aim of preparing the way for a multilevel synthesis. And concludesWe suggest that a low trpLNNA value form a diet based on maize of other foods that can lower R value might favor the development of fanatical ideologies and a risk factor towards violence or intolerance on the occasion of conflicts. This piece is a study of ideological and religious dimensions of cannibalism in Aztec culture  not an investigation of whether or not cannibalism occurred outside of those contexts.gtAnd what is to say the sacrifice didnt serve the additional role as an offering to the lower classes who couldnt afford a wide range of foodstuffs?The very source materials this article is based on.  Even the authors of this article recognize that the consumption of human flesh was understood as a process by which the metaphysical properties of the sacrificed were passed on to the consumer.  Warriors and members of the upper class were allowed to consume flesh in religious ceremonies and beyond the dubious testimony of a single conquistador there is no historical evidence that suggests the lower classes were allowed to consume human flesh.gtYouve gotten so caught up on the thought that this article is saying that Aztec diet made them fundamentally savages that youre ignoring what it actually sayNope.  The word savage appears no where in any of my posts and in fact I have deliberately avoided discussing the larger and blatant biases of this piece in favor of highlighting the intellectual and methodological problems with their assertions.  Youve ignored key elements of my posts the article in question and the larger religiouscultural framework that underpins this topic.  My first inclination would be to say youre being dishonest but now I am leaning more towards you genuinely not knowing any better like your claim that Tenochtitlan had a population in the millions alludes to I get the impression youre selftaught.  This piece is obscure and has received no real attention from the broader anthropological community precisely because its flaws are so widely apparent to Mesoamerican specialists.

The fact that the Nazi party won such a large share of the vote gave them a very strong position politically.Youre basically saying that unless everyone always qualifies every historical statement they make in casual conversation with a dozen clauses  electoral politics is important the Nazis won big in  which made them almost unavoidable in any rightwing coalition but of course still left it up to Hindenburg to appoint the chancellor and he of course rejected Hitlers first bid at becoming chancellor and so on and so on  youre going to declare theyre doing bad history.

Its just that the situation in the case of the th century plains the adoption of nomadic pastoralism fosters violence. Similarly thcentury San or for that matter st century millennials in developed countries didnt kill each other at rates anywhere near thcentury Plains Indians but its not because they all held hands in circles and sang kumbaya. Its just that any individual who wants to violently solve their problems is greatly increasing their own chance of being violently solved or having their life totally fucked up for modern millennials.Still people will argue that American Indians were especially evil or that San were especially wonderful and pure and then make arguments based on that which are usually harmful well Plains Indians were bad people so replacing a risk of violent death with reservations so bad that the Indians would rather fight constant war than live on them is all right or San are such pure people we should ban them from keeping livestock on their own land and plug up their outsider technological water pumps in order to keep them pure.,badhistory,cuhzc0l,50,t5_2wo26

I am way more left wing than most so Sanders seems like a no Brainer but at the same time I feel like Im practical and Hilary stands the best chance unless someone huge like Biden throws his hat in which would further complicate things because I love Papa Joe.But like I was saying I think on the whole Hilary has at least from the small mainly anecdotal and totally not scientific research Ive conducted most of the black vote cornered. That and I cant help but feel Sanders panders suuuuper hard to his demographic.If people are trying to weigh which candidate is more progressive certainly Hillary Clinton would have a better record for them than most politicians on the right. But she also supported the Democrats embrace of toughoncrime policies like threestrikes in the s and was a huge defender of the  welfare cuts well into the s. Just for me personally welfares kind of a makeorbreak issue and if somebodys willing to support a  billion cut in food assistance Im gonna have trouble supporting them when they run for something.I feel like at least some of the critiques of Sanders for being purely economic are just criticism of how his campaign appears or markets itself. Certainly a lot of the Bernie supporters on twitter or reddit havent done the campaign any favors but people should more concerned with what positions candidates have supported in the past or how they actually voted. But yeah I think youre absolutely right in why Hillary has the support she does. Im not AfricanAmerican but I can see how image and political association with a beloved figure could cement a candidate a huge chunk of the vote. My grandparents LOVED John F.

It is the channel through which all culture art knowledge and skill is transmitted and kept alive for posterity. Without it there is literally nothing to distinguish us from animals. There is no human community anywhere that does not have such a relationship in which the student must necessarily respect and defer to the teachers authority.Only in modern Western society from climate change to holocaust denial to antivaxxerism and creationism do you see huge numbers of people who think they know better who reject the proper relationship between teacher and student and thus reject the very basis of all civilization.

You would rarely spend more than three lessons on any given topic. We had three lessons on Ancient Egypt three lessons on Medieval England three lessons on World War I three lessons on World War II three lessons on Rome three lessons on Aboriginal Australia Australia before European settlement. I dont remember any topic or period getting more than this except for Colonial Australia    which got a full term  weeks. Ive probably forgotten a few topics but that gives you the general idea. I do not remember ever having a lesson that mentioned the Russian Empire Ottoman Empire Byzantine Empire USSR China Korea South America Africa the Reformation or any of that stuff except in relation to the world wars.Mixed in with these lessons were the lessons on runoff voting the water cycle and earthquakes.

Furthermore Flora would tell how Geminius one of Pompeys companions fell in love with her and annoyed her greatly by his attentions and when she declared that she could not consent to his wishes because of Pompey Geminius laid the matter before Pompey. Pompey accordingly turned her over to Geminius but never afterwards had any thing at all to do with her himself although he was thought to be enamoured of her and she herself did not take this treatment as a mere courtesan would but was sick for a long time with grief and longing. And yet Flora is said to have flowered into such beauty and to have been so famous for it that when Caecilius Metellus was decorating the temple of Castor and Pollux with paintings and statues he gave her portrait also a place among his dedications.

5324716,0,t1_cvp5lwl,Heres the problem with that statement. They present what they say as factual. Indeed they derive humor from the factual presentation. Theyre riffing. The jokes only WORK if they are responding to something at least kindof true. For example suppose I were to say The American Civil War happened because at some point someone realized that maybe black people were like human and not some form of inconveniently talkative lawnmower.Sure. Im being humorous. And am obviously oversimplifying. But at the same time there is a kernel of truth to my statement. Racism and slavery was the driving cause of the American Civil War. Now suppose I were to say exactly the same thing except substitute The American Civil War with The Vietnam WarThe Vietnam War happened because at some point someone realized that maybe black people were like human and not some form of inconveniently talkative lawnmower.Isnt a very funny statement. Its nonsense. And the defense Well Im joking about that doesnt mean Im not misinforming you. Especially if I announce that I am going to tell you things about history that you never realized. Thats why its worth poking at. Because the basis of the jokes can still be FALSE. And people will still tell you they learned something on Cracked. By announcing your intention to discuss history you dont get to defend your failed historical discussions with But I was joking when the issue isnt with the jokes its with the setup so to speak. Also its worth noting  BadHistory is not about being some bastion against evil. We ALSO entertain and inform. We get enjoyment from discussing inaccuracies and correcting them.

Historians generally tend to condemn the CSA for defending the practice of chattel slavery but do not condemn the Roman Republic and Empire for doing the same. Why is that? The popular Reddit view would say that its because of someguy named Victor writing the history but that doesnt make too much sense really.  Lets instead look at historical contexts. During the very long time that the Roman Republic and Empire existed chattel slavery was not regarding as being out of the ordinary by pretty much everyone around. Meanwhile by the time of the US Civil War slavery was regarded as cruel and inhumane by just about everyone except the CSA. In essence historians are not judging Rome and the CSA historians are informing people now what those alive at the time thought of Rome and the CSA. ,badhistory,cvsbjhu,2,t5_2wo26

5623288,0,t1_cwtohvc,Well it is a deterministic to say Yugoslavia was doomed with the death of Tito I dont think it had to happen. Tito and his regime negotiated a fascinatingly flexible host of policies to allow for nationalism while stamping out its extremes. I think it worked and could have continued but for those extremes of nationalism rising unfettered on all sides in the years after his death. I like to think of the Spomeniks as reminders of what Yugoslavia achieved. The ones constructed under Yugoslavia are breathtaking the ones constructed for the recent wars are also good although some are shameful bad history apologism crap. Also the Yugoslav basketball team. Great things were capable under Yugoslavia after the fall all former republics are struggling economically. The history is fascinating I hope very much that all the former Republics and Kosovo are able to function well and become prosperous nations but we will see what happens. I saw that HDZ was reelected into power SMDH. I dont think that is the country to take Croatia into the future I hope it works out.

5674765,0,t1_cx0g0na,gtI will just throw out that your idea that African implies black is a little misguided. If were going to shoehorn ancient civilizations into our relatively modern framework of race the fact that the civilization is in Africa in no way implies that the people who founded it were black or originally came from Africa.I remember reading about a theory that Vikings had come down founded Kemet and went back home. When that didnt pan out they switched it to the greeks nevermind the fact that Greeks were the students of Kemet and eventually just settled on saying well we cant say for sure. My friend Im not ascribing ill intent on your part but lets be real here. Have you red the hieratic text? How do you explain the fact that the Kemetyu themselves clearly say they are from the heart of Africa? How do you explain the mountains of Anthropological evidence the fact that most pyramids are in Nubia or the words of your beloved greeks themselves? I dont understand how arguments like yours can be made with a straight face by just claiming well we dont know that  without adressing the whole body of evidence that is before us. I havent even mentioned the black mummies who are still wearing traditional African hair styles and stuff because quite frankly I dont really feel like it.gtBeyond that Constantin Franois de Chassebuf went to Egypt in  which was well before Napoleon travelled there and he was also certainly far from the first European to go to Ottoman Egypt. Its also worth noting that th century orientalists are generally not good sources especially when theyre making generalizations about ancient Egypt based on a tour of the at the time contemporary version of the country.My mistake on the Napoleon aspect however I dont understand the rest of your argument. Comte de Volney was referring to the monuments the carved faces he saw all around him bearing negroid features. He also mentioned some of the darker skinned coptic egyptians but his assessment rested mainly on the statues some of which have since been lost to time. I have no reason to believe that a learned man from that time period would be unable to evaluate Negroid facial features considering the quality of crafstmanship thats in Kemet. Unless you have more than hearsay to contest it Ill stand by his impressions.gtIts not like Africa was or is a homogenously black continent and its really hard to say what ethnic groups were living in northwest Africa at the time. Past that it is entirely possible that Egypt was settled by people from the far older civilizations immediately from the north who were probably not black.Im assuming you meant NorthEast Africa. Since the predynastic period stretches back to    BCE I would love to see a source or citation for who wouldve come to that area to settle beside the Nile Valley Africans. The timeline is very clear civilization traveled up the Nile river and came to an Apex at Kemet. Ive already cited the Hieratic text and Anthropological evidence that backs this fact what do you have to counter it other than what ifs?Im not even going to mention the fact that Egypt is one of the most inhospitable places for people without melanin so the thought that some mysterious non black group came down from the North to suffer and establish Kemet next to a bunch of African nations they would have no prior connection to seems completely absurd. Is that really easier to accept than Nubians walking up the Nile?,badhistory,cx0ie55,-12,t5_2wo26

5775670,0,t3_3txmld,So yeah read McWorters Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue.One of my major peeves with pop history stuff which is more my area of expertise is that theres no indication of when a book is completely serious and mainstream when its a work by a serious academic with somewhat controversial ideas when its fundamentally unserious stuff like youll find in Cracked articles and Buzzfeed lists and when its straight up conspiracist crap.Now bad history I can usually? spot coming a mile away buit in this case its hard for me. On the one hand the author pushes some ideas that he freely admits are controversial and makes a seemingly compelling case but then  Truthers and Holocaust deniers can make seemingly compelling cases if you dont hear the cases against them and on the other hand he spends a lot of time on stuff that should be pretty banal and obvious if youve spent more than  minutes in BadLing for example.Anyway there were a couple of ideas that stuck out in the bookLinguistic prescriptivism is obvious bullshit people used to complain about stuff that is completely acceptable today as if it was the cancer that was killing EnglishSapirWhorf the theory that says your  thinking is shaped and limited by the language you use basically is just plain unscientific based on false premises and kinda ridiculous if you stop to think about it more than a secondthose are the bits that I found uncontroversialComparative grammar is more interesting than etymologyEnglish has a remarkable history of simplifying its grammardunno if these are mainstream ideas but hey Im on boardEnglish grammar borrows from Britains Celtic languages a lot more than is widely acknowledgedViking settlers developed a simplified dialect of Old English which later became mainstream English. This is a major reason for English grammar becoming simplerthats the stuff I think he makes a case for if only because I dont know the arguments againstGermanic languages of which English is one are unusual among the IndoEuropean languages for the relative wealth in hissing sounds. These were probably borrowed from a Semitic language and that language was probably Phoenician who may have had trading contact with ProtoGermanic speakers and taught them those hissing sounds.thats the bit that seems pretty cranky to meAnyway its a good read but I hesitate to recommend since I dont know how far off the reservation the author is.,badhistory,cxd0xxu,5,t5_2wo26

5855901,0,t3_3vfwn6,In that last picture what kind of tank is that?I mean I have done a lot of research on tanks but that one just baffles me.Lets go over it bit by bit.First up the turret. Its a rectangle. A long rectangle. The only german tanks equipped with the box turrets in their mass production models wereTiger IPz IV Hand a few other models that are NOT even close to what we see here.Moving on to the gun what the heck is up with that muzzle brake on the end of it?Most muzzle brakes would have a slight gap in the actual brake. That is just a solid piece that looked like it was welded on.The front of tank is just weird. It is really rounded which isnt something you see on a lot of WWII tanks. Lots of sharp angles because it was easier to mass produce that way. Plus if it is a Pz IV or a shudder Tiger I that has been horrendously mutilated beyond recognition.Wait a second! We are talking about the occupation of Ukraine! The Tiger didnt enter service until . Similarly the profile doesnt match the Pz. IV in ANY of its variants.To be quite honest I knew it wasnt a Tiger tank the second I saw it because of the sloped armor. The Tiger had straight unsloped armor.Soooo...What tank is it? Hell if I know. I just spent ten minutes trawling through my extensive collection of photos of tanks and I could not find a single German tank that matched this profile so I checked my Czechoslovakia set.At first I thought it might be a Skoda T but the turret is almost rear mounted in the picture from the comic so that was out. The turret is traversed so it rules out a LOT of tanks.So I thought it might be the Pz.  nA or the Pz.  t. No dice. The front armor doesnt slope the turrets arent that large and long.So at this point I am running out of ideas for what this tank could be. Definitely not a captured french tank.In my semiprofessional opinion it looks kind of like an M Patton chassis with the turret of...something. Really the combination rectangular box and almostnotquite rear mounting is throwing me off.,badhistory,cxn8jjg,20,t5_2wo26

Everyone has clear reasons to be doing what theyre doing I never found myself scratching my head at why characters were doing anything or really any sequence but the one where Rey randomly finds Lukes lightsaber. As I said it does get burdened with too much plot and character fluff but not enough to drag the story down too much.What I dont understand is your point about the lightsaber fight being the weakest from any angle. As far as flashy choreography and visuals go it definitely beats ANH and arguably Jedi and as far as emotional weight and substance goes it beats everything in the Prequels and matches the OT.  If you mean it doesnt make sense that theyd defeat a trained lightsaber fighter consider that Kylo Ren had a lot going against him having been built up as only semicompetent and then being weakened from having killed his dad and shot with a weapon that earlier blew up a boulder.,badhistory,cyisv48,2,t5_2wo26

Going by percapita arguments we shouldnt be number . All modem problems are due to corporatism. This one really peeves me because I see it a lot in liberal circlejerks. Lots of stuff isnt corporate and it still sucks. Corporatism isnt always good but it also isnt the source of all evils.The points we can agree on are a need for more education spending and changes to American culture. But I should note that cultural changes are hard to do as a topdown thing. So yes parents and students kinda are the problem in aggregate at least.,badhistory,cyluve4,7,t5_2wo26

6220055,0,t1_cywmtc9,Post your full citation with page number if you would in whatever language you are using. I dont need your translation.   You are posting from the section on Subjective Law between subjects. Go to the section on Subjective law or the index and look up SubjectObject relationship. And if your Teorie Prava doesnt have a section on SubjectiveObjective Law which I doubt Ill simplify it for you. Subjective law is split as you should know but seem to be purposefully ignoring between subject  subject relationships concerning the object in question. This is corroborated in the citation from before gtbetween a number of people in relation to the objectand then between the legal subject and the legal object. That is to say the bearer of the rights and the object of those rights. Which is referenced bygtthe relationship between the person and the objectThe definition of legal realtionship in pure subjective law is not germane to subjectobject relations in objective law. It does not deny a legal relationship between the subject and object. The legal relation between subject and object or owner and object in property law is crystal clear. The relation between subjects exists in property law in relation to their relationship to the object in question. Look it up. Post your actual source. Ill wait. Of course you dont have to but Im perfectly satisfied with Silberberg and Schoeman.Edit Obligatio is even stronger than the term to duty in terms of anyone in Roman jurisdiction and obeying the law. That doesnt actually help your case. Prosecution for breaking a law implies an obligation to observe the law. ,badhistory,cywninn,-5,t5_2wo26

6351536,0,t3_42l08y,As you can see I made a bit of a balls of the Moratorium voting thread. Weird thing is I dont even remember posting it since I was only half finished at the last time I have some coherent memories of last night. Before you ask no it wasnt booze it was some new sleeping meds I tried out. I had an infection that was pressing on a nerve cluster for ages and it felt like Id both had a migraine and someone decided to stick a fork in my eyeball. So after having been on opioid painkillers for three weeks solid and taking a bit more than prescribed because they didnt work so good it was finally over.  hours of sleep each day does get tiring after two weeks. The only good thing to come out of it all is that I lost my Christmas pounds in the process.But at that stage I think I might have been used to the daily dose of happy pills. They certainly started to work less and less the drowsy effect disappeared and generally I had to take more to make em work. So now that Im off them I feel like Im taking caffeine pills throughout the day. I get about sleep is about  hours a night and Im slightly on edge all the time with the brain on hyperspeed. So I finally capitulated last night and took some sleeping pills. The few times I took them before I had to take twice as much as normal before I even noticed much and even then it was sometimes still impossible to fall asleep. This time however they kicked in almost right away and I dont remember a damned thing how I got into bed what I did before or what I said. Apparently I had a little chat with my wife ate a bell pepper went away and then came back a few minutes later to have the same chat again and eat another pepper. So there you go the moratorium vote post was half written in a drugged haze. Im surprised it is sort of coherent at least this morning I found that my PJs were on backwards and I had put my shoes on the bed for some reason. Heh no more sleeping pills for me I think. ,badhistory,czblkxp,6,t5_2wo26

Thats a sensible way to look at it but a cause can also be thought of as something that was necessary or at least very important to the success of the event. Without the printing press Luthers work would likely have a completely different impact and perhaps not something that looks like the revolutionary and farreaching Reformation that actually happened  although with historical speculation like that we can only guess what might have happened.Its like how someone might argue that the strength of the German armed forces is what caused World War II.

7642465,0,t3_4jwc19,Some things I think about while reading any nonfiction book. What is the authors intent in writing this? What biases does the author have? If the author makes statements of fact without citing them why did they do so?  If they did use citations what do those citations tell you? Are they primary sources or secondary sources? Are the sources all from a particular school of thought or a particular group of people or are they spread out? Pay attention to hyperbole. If it gets used very often it might be an indicator of poor scholarship. Pay attention to descriptions of how people are thinking or feeling. For example Im reading a Bruce Springsteen biography right now and theres this description of the writing process for New York City Serenadegt With another tune and Sanciouss ambitious piano part suddenly those tiny little words seemed epic. This was the landscape that Springsteen needed to fill innot the remembered desiccated Old West of his favorite movies and TV shows but the gloriously dangerous streets of s New York at night a decayed but sublime environment glimpsed as only someone from out of town as one version of Vibes Man put it could really appreciate it. While evocative and powerful this isnt particularly scholarly writing. Too much of this kind of writing should raise eyebrows. I also really like what uchocolatepot said about uncited statements of fact outside the area of expertise of the author. Referring back to this Springsteen biography Im reading Im perfectly willing to accept at face value any statements the author makes about rock n roll in the s especially New JerseyNew York acts because those are things he would have likely studied as part of the biography. Im not going to be as willing to accept any statements about things like political climate in the s or s because those are only peripheral to the subject matter. ,badhistory,d3awnb0,4,t5_2wo26

The political power of the army was not derived from the constitution or some formal structure but because many people believed that reverence for the army is the right thing to do. So if you try to attack the structure you are basically only creating a martyred army. gt So it stayed a state inside a state and destablized the republic and fed into the stab in the back theory even though many of them knew it was false... you know.. since they were in charge.This is why I emphasize the perspective of front line soldiers they outnumbered the people in the high command or at least in positions were they have a good overview probably a thousand to one and later within the Nazi movement probably by a similar margin. gt That is what the treaty didnt address and IMHO why the second round with unconditional surrender was so important.

8859986,0,t1_d7bzacb,Records of th century musket trials are interesting because there certainly were individuals who claimed much higher accuracy Col Hanger famously claimed that a common infantry musket would hit the figure of a man at  yards assuming it wasnt bored too badly thats about on par with the Graz results and presumably means he would hit a much larger batallion target  of the time at the same distance yet musket trials generally show closer to  accuracy at that distance.Its a good thing this isnt Askhistorians because Im about to make a wild speculation based on something I vaguely remember reading on the internet years ago. In the early s a writer apparently interviewed an old Indian who was known for being able to hit small animals from quite some distance with a bow and arrow so the writer set up a large modern archery target at around  yards and the Indian struggled to hit it at all. The excuse he gave was that the large bright colors were too destracting and made it difficult to aim. Maybe there really is some psychological factor that makes it harder to aim at a large target or makes people less likely to take careful aim.Or maybe the average infantryman really was that bad at aiming or maybe most soldiers smoothbores up through the civil war really were shaped like bananas.,badhistory,d7cufpo,3,t5_2wo26

So it couldnt literally just send an army of  million men to fight in Europe but it could sure as hell support them sizably and arm them more than they could wish for.A lot of Europe demobilized because it could afford to demobilize because in part the US was acting as a shield to keep the USSR from doing anything invadey. This also helped pretty much all of NATO because by avoiding investing as much on defense they could shift their economies elsewhere to help speed up reconstruction of their nations and economy yielding a stronger more resilient nation in relatively short order  unlike the USSR which had to both continue expanding and modernizing its military and rebuild from the massively destructive war simultaneously.By most metrics the USSR could afford another war in Europe even less than most of Western Europe could.

11097568,0,t1_depr3iz,gt OP seems to have a completely bizarre definition of civil war thatOk so this got me interested in what exactly a civil war is. Im sure its a touchy thing to define mainly because theres a lot tied up in who wins if its also a separatist style civil war a la the US Civil War.  So one definition I foundchromeextensionecnphlgnajanjnkcmbpancdjoidceilkcontentwebviewer.html?file defines Civil war as  gtThey define a civil war as an armed conflict that meets the following criteria gt a the war has caused more than  battle deaths gt b the war represented a challenge to the sovereignty of an internationally recognized state gt c the war occurred within the recognized boundary of that stategt d the war involved the state as one of the principal combatants gt e the rebels were able to mount an organized military opposition to the state and to inflict significant casualties on the state. I think we can say criteria A is only there to distinguish civil wars from nasty riots so lets maybe focus on BE? the war represented a challenge to the sovereignty of an internationally recognized stateSo yes. Both North and South Korea were internationally recognized though I suspect that international recognition of the North came from only the Soviet block where as the South was recognized bu the UN. The UN said that  gtThe UN declared Rhees government as a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult and the Government based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission in addition to a statement that this is the only such government in Korea. So...maybe a tie here? Kind of a civil war but kind of a war between two  states? Seems unclear. the war occurred within the recognized boundary of that stateNothing to talk about here I think the war all occurred in either North or South Korea. the war involved the state as one of the principal combatantsSo Id say that the Korean war involves two states North and South. Under this definition then most separatist internal conflicts cant be called civil wars. In general if youre trying to section off a country to form a new country you already have a state  or at least a facsimile of one. So for example FARC in Columbia or the Zapatistas in Mexico is a total civil war  a group out of the government using violent means to seize control of the state. The DNR and LNR might not count. Certainly the DNR and LNR governments think theyre already separate states and at times even act like it. What do you think? the rebels were able to mount an organized military opposition to the state and to inflict significant casualties on the state.So another tough one maybe? I think both  North and the South Korea declared sovereignty over the entire peninsula and certainly implied that the other side were rebels.  But I also think the language each side used described it was invasion. Not knowing Korean enough I cant say if the north was using the word as a synonym for aliens or outsiders maybe you can shed some light on this? It seems to me you can call the Korean war both  a war between sovereign states and a civil war though. Thoughts?  ,badhistory,depwedd,6,t5_2wo26

11131736,0,t1_detelj9,gt Yes but violent conquest does not equal total cultural assimilation or destruction of regional variation.No it really doesnt. But neither I nor the author of this essay claimed that it does. WallaceHadrill writes about centralised control the suppression of local identities the imposition of a unified system of beliefs and values but he never purports that those concepts ever even came close to being universally applied by the empire.gt Bending history to fit a theme is definitely not new or even that bad but it does not really excuse this imo. Sure but my entire point was that the author doesnt bend history in any significant way.gt An ideological component is usually involved yes but just because at times a similar mind set might be invoked when speaking about something does not mean that two arguably unrelated and unequivalent terms can be used interchangeably. Even your comparison of modern racism does not fit the Roman idea of barbarism. This kind of false equivalency should not even be entertained and this argument finds its best footing when used in a comparison of ancient Rome to modern politics which should be a bit of a red flag. This is one of the weaker points of the essay for sure but I dont see it as nearly as damning as you seem to do. Two things dont need to be related to be compared to each other. Yes there are marked differences between the ancient idea of the Barbarian and modern views about the Third World and the essay would probably have achieved a lot more nuance by highlighting them. But stressing the similarities between two things doesnt necessarily imply that they are totally equivalent. WallaceHadrill simply points out that in both cases marked differences in wealth can often be perceived and that a sense of cultural superiority played a role then and now.I really dont want to come across as antagonistic and I dont think you wrote this with mean spirited intent.

Noone reading the Greek without that already in mind would translate it that way.  So no.gtWhat he means by shape is not clear because it could go for Mythicism as well which is my point.As I said what he meant by shape is not clear.  That he states in the very next part of the sentence that Jesus was not equal to God is perfectly clear.  Which is why for centuries apologist translators have been tying themselves in knots to get  to mean something it doesnt.gtI understand that people can still have revelations of Jesus after he diedAnd thats what Paul says happened with him.  I have no idea what point youre trying to make here.gtIt does have a reference of him rejecting the majesty but its not clear he was ever was on Earth you cant just say he was especially since there were levels of Heaven as seen in the Ascension of IsaiahAnd where does Paul say all this happened in the heavens?  On one hand we have consistent traditions that Jesus death happened on earth.  On the other hand we have this contrived thesis that it all happened in the heavens  something that noone at all noticed apparently until the selfpublished amateur Earl Doherty made this amazing discovery and Carrier propped it up with things like his Davidic sperm bank in the sky nonsense.  But nowhere does Paul mention that all this crucifixion dying and rising was happening in the heavens.  Isnt that a bit odd?And even Carrier has to admit that that the Ascension does have Jesus on earth in what he in typical style blithely skates over by dismissing it as a kind of earthly sojourn but in an absurdly brief fashion. gtIm saying the reason those things are pushed is because they seem to have the same material in it. Youd have to prove that Acts is a reliable history. What?  I dont have to do any such thing.  If as you claim Jesus was considered a divine celestial being and only later got historicised then we should find him as a divine being in the supposedly historicised stories in gMark gMatt gLuke and Acts.  But we dont.  There is not even a hint that the Jewish Messiah in those earlier texts is God in human form.  Acts  even depicts Peter giving a long sermon outlining what he and the others allegedly believed about Jesus.  No mention is made of him being God.  Doesnt that strike you as strange?  A rather significant detail to leave out dont you think?Unless of course that idea had not yet developed when Acts and gMark gMatt  and gLuke was written.  What we see is a man being turned into a celestial being and then a god.  Not the other way around.gtAre you throwing aside the fact that another Gospel puts Jesus in different point in history?What?gtI gave you milk not solid food for you were not yet ready for it.

He dismisses Josephus references to Jesus. He reads Pauls Jesus as exclusively celestial. He denies that Jesus had a brother named James. He dismisses the Gospels as historically useless. He denies the existence of Q. He dismisses the criteria of authenticity as completely invalid. And he claims to have found evidence for a preChristian Jewish celestial Dying Messiah tradition.

11327013,0,t1_dfftbz8,A stupid comment.  No historian has proof for anything that happened in the past.  We only have varying degrees of likelihood.  Obviously for recent events especially for ones where we have photographic or video evidence the interpretation of likelihood is going to be totally different for ancient events where we are dealing with fragmentary sources which are rarely contemporary and almost never by witnesses.  But all historical analysis is a matter of a subjective but rational analysis of what is likely to have happened based on available evidence.Your dismissal of the existence of Jesus as being totally speculation is stupid as well.  Speculation is simply positing what may have happened without any evidence to back up the proposition.  Thats merely an assessment of possibility.  Historical analysis much more  a rational evidencebased assessment of likelihood.  So no its not merely speculation.But your childish response shows yet again that you have no rational position on this just an emotional knee jerk reaction.  You have an emotional irrational attachment to the idea that no historical Jesus existed and you are prepared to dismiss the analysis of most premodern history as speculation so that you can cling to this silly illogical faith belief.  Basically youre being an irrational fundamentalist.,badhistory,dffwcc1,5,t5_2wo26
