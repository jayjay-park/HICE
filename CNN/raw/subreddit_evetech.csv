3068476,0,t3_2vb34a,Prices are not in the database since they change from day to day and hour to hour. What youll want to do is pull market prices from CREST or evecentralevemarketdata APIs for each typeid.,evetech,cog1lcu,3,t5_2yh7p

7712221,0,t3_4ky7y0,Do you see the cachedUntil entry in the API result? Try requesting the endpoint after that time.If the total SP hasnt changed and your sure that the skill actually trained you might have found a bug. Consider opening a ticket ingame. Especially if this happens ingame too..,evetech,d3itsod,1,t5_2yh7p

8324627,0,t1_d5i23t3,Your jedi skills are lacking  I blame the dark side.AnyhooRequired skills for items are stored in pairs of attributes in dgmTypeAttributes.requiredSkillnumbergoeshereand requiredSkillnumbergoeshereLevelSo requiredSkill and requiredSkillLevel for the first required skill. requiredSkill and requiredSkillLevel for the second and so on.        | attributeID | attributeName       | description                                |        |          | requiredSkill      | The type ID of the skill that is required. |    |          | requiredSkill      | The type ID of the skill that is required. |    |          | requiredSkill      | The type ID of the skill that is required. |    |          | requiredSkillLevel | Required skill level for skill            |    |          | requiredSkillLevel | Required skill level for skill            |    |          | requiredSkillLevel | Required skill level for skill            |    |         | requiredSkill      | The type ID of the skill that is required. |    |         | requiredSkillLevel | Required skill level for skill            |    |         | requiredSkillLevel | Required skill level for skill            |    |         | requiredSkillLevel | Required skill level for skill            |    |         | requiredSkill      | The type ID of the skill that is required. |    |         | requiredSkill      | The type ID of the skill that is required. |    So if you want to get a list of the skills required for something lets go with a Aeon for typeid     select typenameit.typeid from dgmTypeAttributes dta join invTypes it on it.typeidcoalescedta.valueintdta.valuefloat where dta.typeid and attributeid in         | typename      | typeid |        | Capital Ships |   |    | Amarr Carrier |   |    Now this is kinda painful to pull a listing of what skills you need in pure sql at which level. As you need to pivot the results based on two different keys per row. But its easy enough to do in code.To answer what you have above  is the attribute RequiredSkill. The value of that attribute is the typeid of the required skill.,evetech,d5i4t8m,2,t5_2yh7p

8957313,0,t1_d7oj2lv,Also if you feel a need to look at OAuth best practices take a look at the OpenID Connect spec and at Googles OAuth documentation.OpenID Connect is identity federation layered ontop of OAuth and is implemented by basically everyone except Facebook. I call it out here because it OAuth a bit more robust by making some OAuth optional things required.,evetech,d7oj9li,2,t5_2yh7p
9953411,0,t1_db3gngz,Thanks for your answer!I still have troubles authenticating but im on the right path i guess.  is a great help.  What do you mean by  Its easily solved if you can set up a quick Http server that will receive this URI otherwise it can be quite tricky.?  Why do i need an http server for this? Or do you mean just an active http session to get something back? e.g. the auth code?  I can save it in the application or at least get the accesscode with it and then do the refreshstuff and save this.Right now for testing purposes dont know if i keep this split layout my layout looks like this one application will be an asp page in the future is doing the authstuff and runs the main programm with the uri which is saved on the file system and can be replaced easily for updates etc..  ,evetech,db4ydrb,1,t5_2yh7p
10049614,0,t3_5jmnyb,I dont think its  hours. We used to have this exact thing for Slack that ran off a python script and it was no more than  hour. Im not at my computer now but do a call to the endpoint in a browser and it should tell you when the cache expires. ,evetech,dbhhnpm,1,t5_2yh7p
10522443,0,t1_dczu1va,It has been! And its working fine DDownside you have to query per structure. Youll probably hit the structure endpoint to list them all then hit the structure info endpoint per to find out where they are and see if you have docking rights. Then the market endpoint to pull the market for it.,evetech,dd0tzdf,1,t5_2yh7p
11180939,0,t1_dezajii,Well thats the beauty of how I see it it doesnt matter.  I mean how Im proving they come from my app ? Easy. I check the origin of the query. Origin is undefined ? Means it comes from a server hurl.it curl postman whatever rejected. Origin is not  ? Rejected as well.  Then someone could just use the developper tools to send things from that origin. And thats no issue. Because in the end it doesnt matter you need a valid clientIDsecret to access the resources. And if you have them then its the responsibility of their owner what youre doing with them thats the point.  So I dont really care to prove its valid queries from my app. Anyway I will only serve endpoints I implement setDestination getLocation getRegionJumps and such. If you want to mess up with those go ahead its your clientIDsecret anyway.  And concerning CORS I dont know Ive tried sending the required headers taken from this  Doc  Would work perfectly fine from hurl.it but from my app I always get a CORS issue stating there are no headers set. But after the tests Ive done today with my Heroku server had some CORS issues too that I fixed Ill retry tomorrow manually thanks chrome for the console and see if I can make it work directly from client side. that would save a lot of hassle indeed  Anyway thanks a lot for all your help and challenges I appreciate that ! o  Edit  After looking at the ESI issues page it seems I could help with some. When playing with the codetoken and SSO in hurl.it I got a lot of unexpected answers. like  errors not normal,evetech,dezchxk,1,t5_2yh7p
