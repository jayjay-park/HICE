9469452,0,t3_5agpgx,It starts out Would you would you in another gif then in this gif he says Will you marry me? You know it would take a PRINCE of a man to get me to walk down the aisle. I am not into it REALLY but for a split second there? You know what I was thinkin! Well maybe just maybe I could stand to see that face across a breakfast table for the next  years or so... Apparently I do have at least one romantic bone somewhere left in my body. Or maybe its just himself working his magic. Such a smitten sap I am... P,sebstan,d9gbddj,1,t5_31mwq
10011146,0,t3_5j15s3,This guy could efficiently dispatch your ass too if he had good reason and I never forget that that Bucky was trained to kill long before he became the Winter Soldier. To me the only thing that truly separates him from The Winter Soldier is that Hydra managed to suppress Buckys good man caretaking side. They made him into a machine who didnt care about anything but following orders who could kill anyone they wanted him to sans regret.  WWII Bucky he killed but it was to protect the innocent and his fellow soldiers. Hydra did its level best to rip the core of good out of Bucky but he was already a really good soldier. He excelled at his job and weve seen that for all the right reasons he could fight and even kill quite effectively. He is different from the WS in some important ways but he is also more like the WS than you might think. I see WWII Bucky in the WS and WS in Bucky. Its not as cut a dried as all that. Stans performance is astonishingly layered sometimes...,sebstan,dbchbyn,1,t5_31mwq
