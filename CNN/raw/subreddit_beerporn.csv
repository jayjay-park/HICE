Really interesting taste but hard to describe. Some initial vinegarlike taste but not too sour. What I get most is almost like cooked apples in brown sugar.

8742775,0,t1_d6yhi9g,Well from my anecdotal experience IPA was an acquired taste. My first IPA was Abitas Jockamo and I couldnt finish it. So I swore off IPAs for a few years then I tried Konas Castaway  I am in love with this taste. It regularly goes on sale at my local Publix Florida and I usually buy it up. Since then Ive been pretty open to trying different IPAs and have really enjoyed some Florida brewery additions like Funky Buddha. Im originally from Southeast Louisiana so Louisiana breweries have been a staple for me but Florida has been satisfying my palate for the couple years Ive lived here. Anyway I frequently see Jai Alai IPA on this sub so decided to check it out. It reminds me of Jockamo which is hilarious for me because I find it to be quite delicious.

Ardea Insignis was definitely my favorite but Im not sure I would have the ammo to trade for a bottle since it was Rate Beers pick for best beer in North America last year. Im not going to pick a worst because they were all winners but the Jester King Kollaborationsbier was probably the small fish in this pond which is my bad because that was my contribution to the share.
