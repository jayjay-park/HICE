549058,0,t3_20f90a,Havent tested it but I think a group of  and a group of  would work best.  The goal is to upgrade the starbase as fast as possible and to maximize closing of rifts. The group of two consists of a cruiser and an aggro sink.  The cruiser triggers power nodes the other guy just makes sure the cruiser doesnt get shot at.  They do not engage the mirror ships otherwise nor do they stay to mop up  the faster the nodes are cleaned up the sooner the starbase gets fully upgraded.  Once the starbase is upgraded they switch to closing rifts and mopping up ships that get too close to the starbase.  The other group has a sci ship an aggro sink and a DPSer.  Sci closes rifts the other two keep the mirror ships at bay.  Like the power node ship they dont stay back to mop up mirror ships  Any ships left behind should by then have their aggro focused on the players so let them follow them.  Closing rifts fast is more important IMO otherwise the map gets swamped with mirror ships specially the Typhoon types which can get annoying.  ,sto,cg2on3i,2,t5_2rfq3

The single individual can take care of the free station upgrades not surrounded by enemies and kill stuff that leaked through to the station.

Yeah sure i can agree with that. It worked when there were only  reps.  started to show its flaws and the most recent addition just showed how bad of a system it really was. And that is why they are reworking the system period. Again MMOs are always in a state of flux and systems are always changing.

Sad truth is not all boff abilities are made equal some are more universally useful while others are highly situational or require much player skill to shine. TT is of the first kind. You need it period. TT is enough in most cases when facing the dreadful DD it means each consecutive plasma torpedo strikes a shield and not your hull. Emergency power to Shields. All EptX abilities are cool in the way that they provide a bonus besides power. EptS gives some percent damage resistance while active. A Galaxy can slot a boff with EptS which is somere around  extra shield resists on top of what you get from the power buff. EptW gives a flat damage boost. Two copies of EptS and two copies of EptW can give you  uptime on both skills. This I know as the basis of the Dragon cruiser build. Hull Heals. A Galaxy has three Engineer slots Commander Lieutenant and Ensign. You can easily spare the Lt slot for a boff with Engineering Team and AuxiliarytoStructural a.k.a. AuxSIF. Together with the EptS skill this can mean lol your torpedoes struck me but Im back at full hullshileds Engineering consoles. Ablative armor console gives hull resistance to both Disruptor and Plasma Electroceramic gives only plasma resistance. Slot one. Threat. I discovered something neat Attract Fire cruiser command gives a bonus to damage resistance. The extra threat means nothing when you play solo but the boost to surviveability is there. Resilient Shields. Neither the capacity of a Covariant nor the regen of a Regenerative shield but still a very good choice. Thing is all shilds in space have bleedthrough. Each strike be it torpedo or beam takes away shield hit points but a portion of the damage is always applied to your hull even when your shields are at . Resilient shields halve that bleedthrough and with EptS you dont really need that much regeneration anyway. ,sto,cgxf5lh,4,t5_2rfq3

Like Excelsior but has two Lt. Universals that make it highly versatile. It can be both a beamboat or cannon cruiser and has  tactical consoles. Not as tanky as Excelsior but can potentially do more damage.

Fleet Support Cruiser | AtB capable     This ship has the possibility of being VERY tanky if you utilize the science powers to that regard.      Otherwise its sort of a middleoftheroad solution that offers decent damage with beams a LtC Sci that can throw Gravity Wells and a Lt and Ens Tac. Fleet Avenger Battlecruiser | AtB capable     This thing shares a lot in common with the Monbosh but it can cloak and is the first Federation battlecruiser. Using dual and dual heavy cannons can be fun but most people tend to stick with beams since it has a turn rate of .      Its not as tanky but to be honest that has never seemed to be too much of a problem for most people.     If you PvP with it its one of the best builds to use a xAtB layout on.

904282,0,t1_ch71su1,There is whats called a rep grind in STO but it takes little effort its just timegated by way of daily projects that you have to fill. You do one of the events that gives the matching type of Marks the first one each day gives a sizable bonus then you dump that some credits and some Expertise dont worry youll have a shitload even without grinding in for a boost to your reputation exp. Missing a day has no penalties other than just not being as far along as you couldve been.Under current numbers youll max a reputation in  days. This sounds like a lot but you an run one event a day  minutes tops usually with a good group and thatll cover it. The grind for some of the equipment is a bit worse because its bought with dilithium but much of it weapons especially is given to you semirandomly as you fill up the projects for rep exp.You also get a project when you max a rep that gives you an item you can transfer to an alt so they get double exp in that reputation path handy for people like me that have severe altitis.You dont need to optimize for individual task forces events or battlezones. In fact other than Borg and Undine theres not a lot of ways to optimize for specific enemies to begin with. And you dont need to optimize much if your weapons all work together that is all beams or all cannons and turrets and your abilities dont have a bunch of unproductive redundancies youll be fine.If you have any more specific endgame questions I or someone else can help.

924622,0,t3_24p09a,Ive been having this problem occur for batteries and most recently PHASER CONSOLES which caused an EPIC problem since it unequipped a console when my inventory was full and caused the console to disappear until I could open an overflow bag. swearing intensifiesAnyway complaining about the problem isnt going to help. Ive noticed that the game seems to consider ground space and sector space to be different things as far as the ship loadouts go even though the loadout will be identical. I havent yet determined if it entirely fixes it but for now when I make any change to my ships loadout  and yes this includes filling up a stack of batteries  I now save the configuration on a ground map switch to a space map and manually reload the configuration if it will let me then save switch to a sector map manually load the configuration and save.Generally speaking Ive seen if it thinks the current configuration IS loadable something is wrong. Youll notice after loading a configuration it cant be loaded again until you unequip something etc. What the something is that is making the game convinced that already equipped items arent equipped I have no idea and its starting to get silly.This is an irritating workaround but it SEEMS to be working at least so far.,sto,ch9dv34,1,t5_2rfq3

964826,0,t3_254xwk,I actually have that Odyssey loaded with turrets on my tac.  If you use it in PvE expect to tick off EVERYTHING and to MELT NPC ships that dont shift their shield facings around.As for gear I went with a full load of disruptor consoles best I could find not fleet or anything some normal survival consoles and an Isometric Charge for groups of baddies.To get back that lost power start learning to love batteries is my best suggestion.  If you can slot in Emergency Power to Weapons somewhere.  Youll see the biggest drop whenever you fire off a cannon ability so if you can plan for it youll do alright.  I think theres also a few Doffs that can reduce recharge time on the batteries so that might be worth looking into I didnt do that instead I got  subnuc Doffs oh dear did I just strip some buffs with my scatter volley?.If you take it into PvP you wont be as effective as a nonall turret boat.  If you take scatter volley with you though you can basically grind all those pesky carrier pets to dust and clear the air.  Standard Disruptors seem to be the best of the free options.  Polarized Disruptors what I use are just that much more annoying since they cut the targets power.  Elachi disruptor turrets will help ignore shields and let you chew right into the hull quicker but youll lose the Disruptor proc.  Nanite will keep the proc but do more shield bleed through.  Its about taste though.For general equipment I went with a full Borg Assimilated set because it was easy to get at the time back before reps and that keeps me alive because once scatter volley goes off EVERYTHING in PvE will come gunning for you.  Survival is key there.  Anything to boost your weapon power will help as well.Oh and dont bother with any RCS consoles.  Waste of time on a turret build.  You can ALWAYS hit them.  ALWAYS!,sto,chdykbt,4,t5_2rfq3

1007220,0,t1_chii8yx,This is a pretty common strawman around here and worth going after.    Modern AB usage has very little to do with why AB originally came into being.    The reasons that AB originally showed up power management overcharging beams and drake not existing mostly no longer being true are really bad reasons to not AB.    AB still   Gives very consistent play even the speed boost unevenness as the cycles equalize are predictable once you get a feel for it.   Lets you cherry pick abilities and play them much more frequently yes even more so than a drake build. Your utility slots GW or Cmd Eng powers RSPDEM are going to be up a LOT more often and that translates directly to increased survivability andor DPS. With beams a lot more.   Youre already minimizing cooldowns on APBAPO so the extra tac slot loss is irrelevant there.   For the cost between DCEsZemoksDicRoks and Free Btran Techs ABs costperformance ratio is massively better than everything else.    Valid modern reasons to not AB   A good Zemok build does more dps nontrivially if youre really good.   You can get better BFAW CD   Rom SRO is nontrivial and you can have  sometimes  by not ABing   Old school players will constantly throw incorrect strawmen at you because being smug is the actual endgame of STO.   Science is good now and some science ships are really good and learning to play via AB makes it hard to switch to science later if you want.   Timing your Aux abilities is actually pretty tricky and if you can do that you could do something nonAB too.    ,sto,chis1i8,5,t5_2rfq3

1281579,0,t1_cidrc5t,gtPlus Im only reducing demand a little bit. Just about everyone agrees that most Dilithium costs in the game are too high. Most of the fix would be a supply increase. Of course people think the dil costs are too high. They want to get their shiny new toys for the least effort possible and in the quickest time and they dont care about anything else. There is no point both giving people more dil and decreasing prices. Both options have the same effect reducing the value of dilithium. Now that may seem good in the shortterm but longterm its a very bad idea. Quantitative easing simply doesnt fix broken economies.gtIf the Dilithium per ZEN rate DpZ hits  because of those it wont be that big. I remind you Its over  NOW.Its at  now yes. But thats only up from... what  not that long ago. And that spike was a very rapid one caused by the dilithium weekend and a high percentage of the playerbase cashing in the MIE event dil reward. Suddenly all the nd and rd and some have even more alts on accounts that would usually only hit k dil a day from a contraband handin are sitting on k dil to refine.gt Im willing to bet the DpZ will be  with or WITHOUT my suggestions by the time X launches.If you want a friendly wager Ill bet in the spirit of the subject a stack of Contraband that it wont hit  dilZen.

1289698,0,t1_cieg0w4,To put it another way lets assume that to improve quality of the release of content which includes a new  ship it would require an additional  days of a QA tester and  days of a developer one month FTE fulltime equivalent.At reasonable industry rates that will add  to my bottom line for that project excluding additional management overhead workstations equipment etc.My breakeven point is now increased by  additional sales to make up for the cost of the incremental quality improvement.What sort of measurable quality improvement can I expect from that  FTE that will make it  likely that more that four thousand more players will buy that ship? Better lifting? Nicer texturing? Fewer spots on the walls that players can walk through? Better dialogue? What? What sort of quantifiable improvement can be made to quality that would ensure a return on that additional investment? To make the business case its not  additional sales I need to make I need to expect more like  or  additional sales to offset the risk.Its just not worth it to deliver slightlybetter quality because any additional quality needs to pay for itself which at some point comes up against diminishing returns.,sto,ciephd1,2,t5_2rfq3

1305840,0,t1_cigifu0,Please correct you? Certainly. The cost decrease is the SMALLEST part of the changes I proposed.  was a spitball endoftheday cumulative number because I wasnt going to go through every cost and figure out what it SHOULD be. When demand is obscenely high decreasing it a little will not change much. Now what I said that made you thing that I was proposing supplyside economics wasnt actually doing that. In the Dilithium Exchange since you insist on going there when I barely referenced it in the OP demand is effectively infinite. You can sit there and watch the numbers go up and down. As soon as an amount of Dilithium is posted most of it is bought. The market is demandside for certain. Increasing the supply of what is being bought wont change much if supply is being consumed that rapidly.I never appealed to authority. I said I know how they could do this and it is easy. Now I have purposefully avoided being blunt except in the one case where you tried my patience yesterday past its breaking point by seemingly ignoring what I said and saying something that I had already addressed as you had been doing repeatedly. But you want to get real throwing out credentials? Ill get real. If I could do something like that in an hour or two by myself after a basic coding course and you think it would take a development team more effort that that you are saying that said development team is incompetent. I did not say the CODING would take an hour. I said the whole PROCESS would take an hour. At least if the person doing it had a brain. I thought about what uses the refining cap in this game in this last interlude. Thinking of it its likely a local variable in the function that runs the assets tab so that the Assets function can cout it and so the Refining child function could work with it. Assume theyre using the countdown method by far the easiest. They go to the Assets function. They find where diCap is defined and they edit it. They find anything related to it and make sure the change doesnt break anything probably  minutes work and push it to a QA person. The QA person sits there putting in random numbers lower or higher than the cap maybe up to a hundred of each to make sure everythings working fine  maybe another  minutes if you want to do it a lot during which the QA person would be bored to tears. Finding no bugs because its not bloody likely that a team experienced with such a system and with such changes would create that many bugs by editing one number unless theyre retarded they send it to be added to the next update. Bam. Done. An hours work maybe. Two TOPS and it MIGHT take up to three devs. If you honestly think that it would take Cryptic that long to do you are calling Cryptic incompetent. And guess what? The first set of . Tribble notes?gt Pricing for items has been normalized. This means that the disparity in value between weapons and nonweapon items has been removed.How did Adjudicator explain this?gtWe adjusted some core price variables in this build.They just did something very similar last bloody week. The changes were insufficient and marginal just like you seem to like. But they did it anyway. They obviously saw profit in it versus the effort. Mind you they altered prices for damn near every Dilithiumvalued item in the game. And yet you honestly think that changing ONE VARIABLE in one place is above their level of effort? And youve been at this how long? No you are making excuses to try and explain away something thats really damned easy to do and Im not buying what youre selling.Im sorry but you are still wrong. Cryptic just did something like this on a far larger scale and you want to argue that raising the Dilithium cap is too hard? Do you view Cryptic as a group of toddlers with keyboards?,sto,cigiv3y,1,t5_2rfq3

Im currently using a fleet assault cruiser refit but I could use a fleet battlecruiser a fleet Chimera or a number of other ships including some fleet escorts.xtt x faw and a zemokd apbapo or just xapbWhy not use the guaranteed cooldown reduction of x auxbat amp x purple technicians and then get Zemok what does he do? Ill have to search for him with x APB and maybe a conn officer for your x TT. Then you have EPTW and EPTA or EPTS and a warp core engineer for a chance at  power to all systems. Wouldnt that be the best of both worlds?Even without auxbat activated I have noticed that two copies of the same tactical ability two beam fire at wills for example or even two tactical teams will not cycle  when one starts it immediately puts the other on cooldown and when one again comes off cooldown the same thing happens again. They do not fire alternately so I see no purpose to having more than one copy of the same weapon ability BFAW and TSShields both being beam abilities will do the same thing and you cant alternate them.This is without activating auxbat and without having energy weapon officers.

1409448,0,t3_2a9yku,The Federation signed the Treaty of Algeron in  with the Romulans which redefined the neutral zone borders and banned the federation from developing cloaking technology.This has been theorized by some fans to be because the romulan neutral zone if compared to star maps from TOS is actually a stones throw away from Romulus and Remus itself where as earth is well within the heart of the Federation.Without cloaks  an invading force would have to cross the federation and the neutral zone and Romulan intel would have plenty of time to see them coming with cloaks  a federation fleet would be able to enter the neutral zone from a staging point well away from federation assets and be in orbit of Romulus in days.And since the Romulan Republic is the official successor state to the Romulan Star Empire and is reconized as a sovereign successor state any treaties in effect with the Empire would continue under the new government unless both parties renegotiate the terms or decide to officialy end or reword the treaty.In the real world there is laws like the Vienna Convention on Succession of States In Reapect of Treaties.EDIT should have done more research the treaty I mentioned in my last paragraph is only enforced by a few countries  most nations do not have a treaty like that in place.But historically  most nations have honored the treaties of their former states.Just because the old regime is gone doesnt mean the new government doesnt want to continue the treaties.In the Romulan Republics case their now close ties with the Federation and Klingons may mean the original reasons for the treaty are gone but why throw away a tacticl advantage just because... plus the Republic might be under pressure from the Klingons to keep the treaty in place because doing so continues to provide the Klingons with a tactical advantage against their on off again foes.So in order to placate the Klingons the Romulans may continue to deprive the Federation of cloaks to keep the status quo.,sto,cisycix,3,t5_2rfq3

To access it use the Iconian gateway in northwestern quadrant of Tau Dewa sector since Im assuming you dont have the transwarp unlocked yet via reputation system. From there you can either fly towards the contested zone and then to the central spire or fly to the command spire right near the Solanaeside entrance and talk to a contact in space to move you directly to the battlezone.Its a fantastic source of dilithium and Dyson marks. Added bonus is shooting giant dinos in the face.gtI like the Tac Oddy and Sov refit but am not sure if either of them are thought well of or competitive in tough content at the moment. What should I be considering instead?Theres a little over a month before the second expansion hits and brings a level cap increase as well as a new tier of ships. While I cant tell you to wait I would consider it as you may like the new shinies. And if you decide that you dont you can always get a T shiny and upgrade it to TU which is close to the new T.gtWhat Rep should I be grinding? why?All of them ideally. Each one has rewards you would want to have. From passive and active traits to gear hangar pets consumables and a host of other things. If you cant afford to run them all at the same time which really shouldnt be an issue I would suggest running the Dyson one alongside with the ground battlezone for dil Omega Task Force since youll be doing lots of STFs and maybe the Counter Command one as it has some really nice gear in it. But again all of them at once would be ideal especially since the rewards on T are pretty significant and can essentially gear your ship up in a single swoop.gtIf I want to grind EC in order to stock up con contraband where should I be?One of the ways I use to make a metric ton of EC is to contribute to fleet projects and use the fleet credits Ive earned to buy and open fleet engineering duty officer boxes then sell the results. With some luck you may get doffs that sell for well over  million a pop. Alternatively there is a double XP month coming up. I would consider making a Romulan alt leveling it up getting all the Superior Romulan Operative bridge officers you can get before hitting  mailing them to your main deleting the Romulan rinsing and repeating until youre happy with the number of boffs you got.

Turning off AA will reduce your graphics quality but there are a couple things you can do about this. Bump up the games render scale renderscale . This is more resourceintensive so dont do it too much unless you have a highend PC but it will make screenshots taken with the ingame tool twice the resolution of your monitor which means they can be resized back down afterwards to eliminate jaggies from AA being off.. Use an external screenshot tool doesnt require turning AA off. If you play through Steam there is a keybinding for this.

1949915,0,t1_cknpvbp,gtWeapon procs are simply mathematically irrelevant at very high DPS levelsgtThe more important factor is getting those set weapon damage bonus Yes and no. Heres why the various weapon types are usefulTetryon is the top weapon because its tactical consoles buff the Refracting Tetryon Cascade meaning that in sub  seconds runs since the current record run timewise is  seconds it can be k dps by itsself.Antiproton CrtDx would be the next best weapon type if we knew of any record setter that had a full set because its  crit severity would proc quite often as the crit chance of high dps ships is usually between  and .Protonic Polaron CrtDx is in whats called the top tier of dps weapons as most people arent running short enough runs to make Tetryon stand out and even fewer can get a set of AP CrtDx weapons. The rest of the weapon types Im about to name are also in that top tier. Protonic Polaron stands out because again it has a damage on crit proc which occurs very often.BioMolecular PhasersDisruptors CrtDx. Technically Disruptor would be slightly better. These are admittedly up here in part because of the set bonus increasing phaserdisruptor damage but also because with that set their second proc is a . chance to proc. Romulan Plasma CrtDx has everything going for it but some people think its not quite as good. The set bonus is great especially as it comes with a fantastic console thats already being used on nonromplas ships and a beam array as its set weapon and its also boosted by the fleet pla consoles in terms of raw damage though they do add a chance for a plasma dot to other weapons so thats not just a plasma weapons boost. They also have the advantage that both of their procs plasma and disruptor deal damage. weird sidenote on the above  my rainbowboat that does around k and tanks for context gets .k dps out of the plasma burn from the experimental romulan plasma beam array and the  pla consoles. My full romplas avenger which is nearer k and still tanks gets in the  dps range from plasma fire.Disruptor CrtDx is also in that list because its main weapon proc increases damage and its a crtdx weapon.So some of them are for the set bonuses I guess you could call the tetryon consoletetryon cascade synergy a set bonus and some of them are for the modifiers. ,sto,cko636i,2,t5_2rfq3

2293384,0,t1_clv2ggl,Feel free to ask. Im going from memory right now so apologies if I miss something. Names of labels are hopefully accurate enough. Click the PvE Queues button below minimap just right of center. Has three triangles together that symbolize ships in flight. This opens the PvE Queues window which defaults to the public queues. Click the third tan along the top labelled Private Queues or something very similar I hope. Select the event you wish to run then Create. This opens the lobby window. To invite players you can usually rightclick their name in chat then select Invite to Challenge Map or something. This does not always work however the second method is to highlight the full name of the player in chat. Then while holding the right mouse button press CrtlC to copy this to the clipboard. Next click the button in the lobby window that says Invite. This pops up a small window with a blank field at the top and a list of players below. In that blank field type a double quote mark then paste the player name in then close the double quotes.

2302474,0,t3_2lmd5v,I noticed last Mirror Event that some pets especially Weavers had a really hard time on that map.  And that hasnt changed and it happens with Mobulais as well though to a lesser extent.At times I think theyre getting held up by enemies that are too far out of range to be visible.  In most cases however they just plain lag behind.  I watch them and it looks like theyre in a cluster barely moving all obviously on different headings long after Ive hit recall or selected a target for them to attack. Ive also noticed that when theyre about to attack they sometimes start powering up abilities when theyre km out of range of the selected target and then they take longer than  seconds to close that distance and actually attack.  They seem... confused.  A lot.  And putting them in recall often seems to cancel what they were doing and cause them to take  seconds to decide to start moving again.These problems arent unique to Mirror but I seem to encounter them mostly on large maps when making frequentlong position changes which is partly to be expected I suppose.  But its pretty disappointing to take a Recluse into Mirror and see Weavers drop from  of my DPS to  if Im lucky.  DPS isnt even really the issue though.  If I cant use pets to aggro because theyre rarely anywhere near me then my Recluse basically becomes a sixweapon brick.I cant say that I saw anything change on  specifically but I dont recall seeing pets crawling up to attack before recently.  I am encountering general movement issues more but I think thats mainly because MIN and Borg Invasions are almost all Im running at the moment.  I really wish that pets would immediately fall in with the carrier and match its speed on full impulse.  Some content really stretches their movement potential to way past the breaking point.Edit Bleh I take back what I said about Mobulais not being as bad as Weavers.  Two MINs in a row now theyve spent  of the match nowhere near me.  And today my Weavers powered up APB and then sat not approaching any enemies for about two minutes when there were a dozen of them just out of range.,sto,clwawgp,6,t5_2rfq3

2319889,0,t3_2lulub,I agree all queues should have an option to award flarks albeit at a poor rate compared to the rep marks they would otherwise award. Also if you chose the flarks instead of the rep marks your cooldown before you can do it again would be longer.Along with this they need to add a Fleet rep in the rep window that allows players to queue their own fleet projects to use up flarks with a reduced compensation of what they would get should they turn them in for actual fleet projects. These could award dil and fleet credit. You could even have special projects that allow players to get fleet gear but at a more costly rate than buying them from an actual fleet including provisions required of course so these projects would be VERY costly. This solves all the bottleneck problems and additionally gives those players who dont want to join a fleet the options they need to actually use fleet marks and get some fleet gear.,sto,clygaks,1,t5_2rfq3

AFAIK the outcome of that was amicable to both parties and production of the content continued albeit modified.That said even if it goes to hell the code is still there and can be used with different skins to make a Star Treklike bridge simulator possibly with other fan organizations providing skins to close the gap that might end up quietly traded around.,sto,cnkcfb1,1,t5_2rfq3

Which could be true if the embryos cant differentiate and thats the cause of the sterility.   They have mastered a means of converting alien DNA to Kobali DNA and reanimating dead tissue.  The basis of the further survival of the Kobali is based on this fact that reproduction and maintenance of the genetic line is solely through this process.  As long as the genes replicate and move on it doesnt matter to the gene as to how.With that being said ignoring the issues with the Vaadwaur themselves as I havent gotten to that part of the story and whether the Kobali used the Vaadwaur who died in the stasis pods waited on Vaadwaur to die in the stasis pod or killed the Vaadwaur in the stasis pods are highly different in ethical outcomes there is a simple ethical equation.If the Kobali do not use the bodies of the deceased to reproduce then the Kobali die out as a species.  If the Kobali use the bodies of the deceased to reproduce I dont have a problem with it even as a Starfleet officer.The Kobali so long as they are not taking life directly or arguably indirectly arent taking anything from anyone.  The person resequenced and revived was dead.Without going into too much gory and gruesome detail should someone elses funeral rites trump the Kobalis desire to survive?,sto,cnwsmxq,1,t5_2rfq3

While we may have not settled all of the differences between our peoples it is folly to squabble amongst ourselves as death approaches.gt The Iconians are coming. We saw them on QonoS and felt the agony of their terrible power. They warned us not to oppose them and yet in campaign against the Vaadwaur in the Delta Quadrant that is precisely what we did.gt We can no longer pretend that war is not upon us. What we can do is arm ourselves with knowledge for the battles to come.gt The Iconians are among the most ancient civilizations of which we know. More than  years ago their empire covered vast areas of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants. While their homeworld of Iconia in what is now Romulan space was the heart of this empire there were dozens of colony worlds and Iconian technology has been found in both the Gamma and Delta quadrants.gt From what we know the Iconians were despots. Known as Demons of Air and Darkness the Iconians ruled by the force of their technology which was far beyond anything seen before including a network of gateways that allowed them to transport vast distances in an instant.gt There have been some recent scholars who have disputed this. They say history is written by the victors and it is true that  years ago the races enslaved by the Iconians rose up against their masters and destroyed the Iconian civilization in a cataclysm of fire.gt These scholars think history should regard the Iconians more kindly. I say their actions speak louder than any fragments or relics left behind. gt The U.S.S. Yamato and the U.S.S. EnterpriseD found the remains of Iconia in what was then the Romulan Neutral Zone in . It was only by quick action that the crew of the Enterprise managed to save their ship but the Yamato was lost. Curiously the commander of the Romulan warbird sent to investigate Starfleets incursion into the Neutral Zone was Taris. It may have been this incident that sent her along her dark path to obsession and destruction.gt We know the Iconians prefer to act through servitor races. Some like the Undine have been manipulated into doing the Iconians bidding. Others like the Solanae the Elachi and the Vaadwaur have willingly surrendered. The Iconians control these races their servitors through a variety of means including the biological weapons known as neural parasites.gt There is another species that serves the Iconians. These are their Heralds. Believed to be survivors of the carnage at Iconia the Heralds are a lesser race that the Iconians raised up to sentience much like the Founders of the Dominion did with their Vorta servants. The Heralds worship the Iconians as their gods and have served as their personal servants and shock troops for eons.gt We know little about these Heralds but we see the marks of their power upon the galaxy.

Once you hit  the Reputations tab on your character sheet will open up with eight or so different reputations.  As a DR youll get  rep marks for each one  enough to fill up a couple of tiers reputations have five tiers each each one costing more rep marks than the previous one.  Depending on which ones you open youll gain access to not only unique specialty items like rapidfire torpedo launchers or proton weapons that are both beams and cannons but youll also get access to rep stores that sell both ground and space weapons.  Its pretty nifty.   In addition Fleet Starbases sell lots of different equipment that is very useful.  Fleet equipment costs Fleet Credits  Dilithium.  You get Fleet Credits by donating things Fleet Marks common duty officers etc. to Fleet Projects.  Its a whole thing.My suggestion as an old player  Figure out what rep you want to spring for ahead of time.  Focus on that.  When you open your mark crates dump the marks into that rep and that rep alone.  Dont spread it out too much.  Then when you hit  focus on that rep.   If youre not sure which one to pick I suggest Romulan rep.  Its a fairly easy rep to level it has good rewards and it has no special bits required to get the unique items.  If you dont like Romulans then Dyson rep is also good.  It has a good mix of stuff and the marks are easily farmed via the ground battlezone.As for fleet stuff save your fleet credits for what are know as Spire Tactical Consoles aka Locators aka CritH consoles.  Theyll set you back a pretty piece but theyre incredibly nice ship consoles for dealing damage.,sto,cq72f5r,1,t5_2rfq3

3674166,0,t3_32gsyt,GW has had issues with gold sellers. While that comes with the territory on one of the more popular games of the genre the ability to trade currency as openly as GW has makes that an issue. They have taken steps in recent weeks to begin to curtail that by instituting bans on gold buyers who using third party goldsellers. Likewise they have put a cap on the amount of gold that can be sent. This is where I feel STO has the advantage. It seems that they have a very viable ECDilithiumZen exchange. The more direct comparison with GW is KarmaGoldGems. The reason the nonexchangeable currency in GW doesnt get many complaints is because it is a currency which has little use beyond crafting legendary weapons. EC in STO has much more function and plays more of a role.I think that honestly GW could learn a little about the accountcharacter based economy from STO. It would be nice to see some form of interaction between the economies especially since I have over m Karma just sitting there.... This would also help WvW balance into the economy a bit better since those players dont get near the gold rewards that PvE or even PvP only players get now.,sto,cqb2us2,3,t5_2rfq3

If I were to get a lifetime sub for  then Id consider it.But thats like just over  months worth of subs. So for me its a question of Do I think this game will continue to be good for the next year and a quarter for this to be worthwhile?And I dont know! Gah! Especially with all ships that come out nowadays that have nothing to do with the sub. I wonder just what am I getting for my sub even now? Account Bank? Slightly larger inventory? Already got the EC and Bank Unlocks So theres the additional question of What am I getting out of this lifetime sub that makes it worthwhile?Sure you get that stipend of  Zen monthly no matter what now... but itll take  months or . years for that to add up to the  you just dropped. Why not just buy that amount of ZEN now if thats what youre going for? Sorry these seem like critical questions... but for  I sure need to ask some critical questions! ,sto,cqd4qdh,1,t5_2rfq3

3704851,0,t1_cqegnzt,totally aesthetic tastes are intrinsically personal.     Yeah t Dd is brutally bad. I wish i could tolerate flying bricks so I could enjoy the canon Dd but thats not gonna happen.    assuming this isnt a thoroughly unwanted Im gonna ramble at length about recent designs.     I like the phantom quite a bit in certain configurations for what its worth.    I can see where its language comes from in fed escorts and their idea for the intel design language. That it ought to have had some sort of nose to it to fit fedscorts better is something Id agree with but it doesnt bother me since I never liked that element anyway.     Same idea with the eclipse except that I really just dont like it.    The nose and the pylons were just awkward.     The scryer is bizarre and offputting so maybe it should have reminded me more of the RSV.     Using the alien fake fed design for a reconsci was such a missed opportunity for an updated Luna that I default hate the ship with fiery passion beyond it not making any sense to me.     The cruiser was just more of the same old same old.       Personally I feel like Fed cruiser designs desperately need to make a break from the prevalence of their standard cruiser visual layout. I dont fly or own one but its incredibly hard for me to see where you can go after designing the Odyssey. It feels like potentially an end point to that set of design elements.  The eclipse was an unsuccessful attempt at this in chasing the stargazer design.       I quite liked the KDF and Romulan ideas from the intel release.   The Qib is to me hands down the most pleasing KDF design cryptics ever done.    It combined the earliest KDF design elements with the intel concept beautifully.  Love that ship.   The matha is a nice mixture of various design elements cryptics been kicking around for a bit. Nothing startling but not bad at all.    Faeht is frickin bold as hell straight up stealth bomber death wing   with a really cool nod to this iconic starship design which has nothing much at all to do with romulans and only tangentially star trek.  I can see the visual element connection between the TOSampSTE warbirds and the TNGDS non Dd designs squished thru the intel aesthetic.   Aehlal much like the fed cruiser same old same old which is fine since roms have so many fewer examples.    Then they come out with the command cruisers and again we get super bold rom designs that mix really really well.   I was initially off put at how bold the wings designs were frankly but they really grew on me quickly once i could play with them in the tailor.      The Feds were nice nearly reaching new model iconic to me.   lots of nods to various predecessors canon and not.  Nothing too far outside the lines but still progressing a bit with the very very strong nod to Excelsior.        The KDF cruisers were  bold ? I guess but so very unpleasant.    If its true that its better to fail spectacularly than just a little than these designs embody that to me.  I have finally managed to cobble together a design out of parts of all  that I dont actively hate.   I just wish theyd taken different notes from KDF canon designs or ignored some of their own. Its fair. cant have everything I guess.    I sincerely hope they have gotten over the idea that KDF ships should look chubby. Stout ? maybe if you only go by the progression up to the future Neghvar but i dont see it personally. I see nothing dangerous about the bortas design and things that have stemmed from that other than they might sit on me.       This new KDF ship looks slick deadly and fast with the edginess literally lots of edges that Id expect in a kdf design. KDF ships canonically at least have always looked dangerous if not outright menacing to me.         The Fed looks like an awkward parts mixnmatch.    I think they really nailed the pathfinder as an update to the voyager design and I wish theyd have taken the saucer from that and tweaked around with the tailmain hull of an escort so it came off as a mix of a defiant and pathfinder with some phantom thrown in but thats not this from my perspective.   The wings and nacelles seem particularly off to me.       Sorry for the length. I just havent ever really been in the right place and frame of mind to go off about sto ship designs.   ,sto,cqekt9o,1,t5_2rfq3

Management of sublicenses is already rather complicated and the people doing the management rarely know the content that well. Could there be trek lovers in those departments working on the license I am sure but top execs doing final say look at the profit much more. I am betting Cryptic didnt like the price tag of the license for the TOS specific ships.

He went and ran off to be a martyr only succeeded at even that because of the rest of the team interfering using the Omega Molecule devices and then you still fail to complete the objective and have to flee. They flat out say the intended mission was a failure and it was only worthwhile to have even attempted because of the information you got along the way.On a side note regarding this plot though... This whole youre accomplishing all your goals and doing pretty well for yourself then suddenly the plot says youve failed bullshit with the Iconian missions and even the queues seriously we fail saving QoNos because some Targs get killed or a single Orion operative dies? is really getting tiring. It happened  times in Blood of Ancients alone and it happens again here despite the fact that we had every opportunity to finish the god damned job and kill TKet. They were weakened and injured we had a mechanism to deal with them and for all appearances wed have the element of surprise.If one fat aging clone with a chunk of metal can get an arm off by themselves than surely  other people in far better condition could use that device and just rain down hell on the Iconian from that elevated position to finish the damn job. Or could have just opened fire while they were weak and distracted. Fuck you Kahless your monologue and the other characters stupid desire to allow it cost the mission and an Iconian kill. Or instead if just watching him and his stupid martyr fight they could have actually utilized the distraction to plant the last of the explosives and used the Omega Molecules themselves to kill TKet.Bring on the Deus ex Machinas to do the job instead I guess the writing wont allow for anything else to fish out a win even after it shows how easy it could have been.

As far as engineers are concerned they wont even be affected since theyre constantly at high power levels sometimes all subsystems are even running at full power. Nowadays competent tactical and science pilots micromanage their power systems for high aux power a minimum of  to get the most out of the AMP warp core mod heals and reputation trait.

At worst case scenario youve lost . points of power to shields most likely rounded down at the players convenience.According to sto wiki a very trustworthy source detect the sarcasm please  points is  of shield regen lost. Do a quick calculation with your shield regen stat and you will see the lost regen is insignificant. In terms of resistance and its diminishing returns we are talking about resistance rating values fluctuating between  and  of lost benefit. Yes its very possible you are complaining about fractions lost. Sorry I hate change as much as anyone but  points imho is not a good enough reason to throw a fit.

That accident could have occurred before the species perfected the technology and before they needed it against the Borg.

I went with a Klingon Science character and my loadouts were a mess. Nothing had any synergy I didnt use kits because I didnt know what they were. I used an odd assortment of beams cannons and turrets and I had no idea what the different deflector dishes did. I didnt even promote my bridge officers until I was around level  because I had no idea I could.        And you know what? I was having a blast. I couldnt tell you what was going on but I loved it.

Even though they could do a lot of fun stuff with this tree give us some new abilities and perhaps even new moves what if our character could prone for example?. But no  it wont sell ships so dont get your hopes up.Bort and by extension Geko just needs a few things to make it happen   Most important being more community demand such as this thread and ideas to expand the tree and associated content.   A bold vision and a sincere willingness to expand the limits of ground systems design which as it stands right now is considerably limited yet has so much untapped potential.   A persuasive design plan strong enough to convince Salamii and TPTB to let it happen. Point  is the most important.

5494593,0,t3_3qckzy,Dyson feels best at least the first time through with the daily missions. I feel but dont know that the dino killing was changed so that as long as they all die you get full rewards so long as you tagged one of them.Kobali isnt a battlezone its an adventure zone like New Romulus. Dilithium isnt plentiful there at all.Dont forget about turning in rep marks for dilithium. This makes stuff like FFA somewhat less plentiful than the other queues which can give you lots of marks in a run.Finally one round of contraband doffing can yield enough to start the project twice over so as long as you have alts you can run  or  simultaneously to get more than  even if youre just logging in once a day.Edit Nukara! The Nukara interior missions give  dilithium a piece now and arent too terribly painful if youre decently geared. But my best advice for grinding dilithium is to grind something else you need because youll likely dilithium cap in the process of doing that.,sto,cwdzigc,2,t5_2rfq3

5537406,0,t3_3qxvzo,When leveling alts I make a note of the last episode I played before reaching Level  then go back and replay some of them for any rewards I wanted leveled when I feel so inclined. AFAIK the recent changed to levels in the later arcs havent changed leveled items maxing out as Mark  at Level . Also be aware that some of those missions have levelless items with a Mark Infinity sign on them. I generally grab those while under Level  because I wont need to replay at Level  for that reward.The free upgrade to Mark  thing came after my last alt reached  so I dont know if every reward has that ability. If so youll only need to replay that handful of missions that have more than one good reward and IIRC you can replay once immediately before hitting the IIRCA  minute replay cooldown.One of the great things about STO is all that content can be played at any level so I also tend to work on leveling to  first so I have most of my skills and traits as well as an endgameish ship to run the content with.

Also as you said the Feds have WAY more Sci Ships. So if you are insisting on flying one picking FED is a good idea. Faction does not really make that much of a difference at the moment any way.

We repeatedly see yourself along with Geko and other members of the Dev Team talk about how you love the foundry and want to give it the time and effort it deserves and yet from a player standpoint the only new content we seem to receive is provided by a handful of developers on their personal time. When can we expect to see more foundry development appearing on the cryptic Schedule? at one point we saw that Tacofangs and Zero were getting some regular scheduled Foundry Time but it was quite often being pushed aside for higher priority projects which is understandable but at what point will this tool which greatly distinguishes STO from other MMOs be bumped upwards in the Priority Scale?I know that the Foundry isnt the most popular tool or a money maker other than the initial buyin but with over  Missions according to your own statistics I feel its now time we start to see a large amount of new assets or some new tech added. Id really like to see the foundry Leave Beta before the end of  but at the same time I feel it needs some pretty hefty tech additions before its ready to enter the Real World. Most notably being Campaign Tech. Well Ive rambled enough. ,sto,cx53b05,7,t5_2rfq3

5991470,0,t3_3xb7nk,This relates back to a discussion that was had on the Daystrom Institute subreddit about the post scarcity economy in Starfleet and how it would function. IIRC the conclusion that people came to was that Star Fleet bartered for its trade goods with other planets so when someone would charge something to the ship the goods could be traded of equal value to the planets holdings and that in turn would be sold and the vendor would get their money or value for the good they gave to a crew member. We see example of that in the very first episode of The Next Generation. Additionally in STO it isnt as if the Federation is still post Scarcity there have been four to six major conflicts back to back Klingon War Tal Shiar Incursion Tholian Incursion Borg Invasion Crystalline Entity raid Undine infiltration Voth Conflict Delta Quadrant War Iconian War and now we have accidentally destroyed an entire civilizations planetary system by letting the Tox Uthal into the hands of the Tholians... EC is a creation of that situation we are budgeting resources within Starfleet itself and those resource credits now have value outside the Federation to resourceful traders and colonists. I would then theorize that the Exchange is a response by Starfleet to prevent a black market outside of the overview of Starfleet intelligence from developing. In theory Earth and Starfleet still doesnt have a currency but currently in the STO cannon scarcity has begot the necessity of developing a sort of proto currency and while that currency is never traded for basic living arrangements housing or food anything beyond the normal rations or amounts is paid for with EC to ensure that the energy consumption of the Federation doesnt overtake its production. Given this model there would be a total amount of EC available Federation wide changing only when new production facilities are brought online or when new universal projects being such as ship development or production. Individual projects outside the norm such as enhancements to the ships engines weapons and shields are handled by the individual ships crews the crafting system and compartmentalized to prevent the infiltration of outside agents on the level of what happened with Egg on Memory Alpha. ,sto,cy50gu3,1,t5_2rfq3

6261785,0,t3_41cl1l,Science is fun. I personally have  scis in sci ships and my highest dps I parsed was done in my Jupiter on a tac captain. Im far from the best when it comes to high science dps but my scis consistently impress me and are always fun. If you want the challenge being a sci on the KDF is doable for sure but there is a lack of science heavy ships. The KarFi or Voquv would be the likely candidates but I dont really like the former and havent used the latter. Fed side theres the Vesta Scryer Pathfinder Dauntless nebula dkyr and mirrorfleet Nova mirror cant be upgraded though for science ships and the Jupiter for a carrier. I can really recommend any of those and therell be somethings within your budget you can look into. Romulan isnt a route I recommend. Theres no carriers or science warbirds besides a dil ship that isnt very good and a sci destroyer which isnt worth the cost. If youd like to try to make a warbirds carrier into a science heavy tac hybrid it can be done but its more like flying an escort then either a carrier or sci ship. Either way enjoy the space wizardry. ,sto,cz1e93s,1,t5_2rfq3

6517290,0,t1_czsopwi,gt Bottom line We need a dil sink that isnt a oneanddone affair such as purchasing equipment dil store reputation etc.I dont think there is one. Any mandatory constant tax will provoke outrage and I cant imagine how youd manage to elevate something like this to mandatory at this point in the game.gt There is however the proposal to increase the dilgtFC return rate. That could help...I actually think this would backfire as far as lowering the DX rates goes. Increasing the appeal for individuals to sink their own earned minerals decreases the necessity for fleet leaders to purchase those minerals. This depression of demand for minerals would actually thus worsen the current rates as nobody would feel the need to buy them anymore if people were voluntarily trading in those minerals without being coerced to do so. The fact that the returns are so lousy means that rather than sinking the minerals into their fleets people keep the minerals for their own use and the fleet leaders must thus buy the minerals off them on the DX. The idea that such a thing would improve the situation is almost certainly naive and naive solutions to problems always backfire.,sto,cztfsn8,1,t5_2rfq3

You run across the map which is so titanically large that nothing the developers could ever think of will ever fill it to find a blue particle trace which sorry but why put the blue traces in a map where the predominant colours are white grey and blue?Assuming you get there before the trace resets elsewhere you have to hope like fuck that your minigame doesnt rubberband and leave you with  points or fail to give you any rewards. Otherwise you have to stand there with no other particle traces available to choose from until the game drops a new trace. On another end of the map somewhere...Andoria was designed by people who hate Star Trek fans. Or by people who hate gamers.Edit Andoria is now so laggy that I cannot move on the map.

6586394,0,t1_d00kk6b,The off part doesnt relate to offensive it relates to the tank picking up the secondary aggro that the main tank isnt focusing on the offnotes as it were.In other MMOs this relates to tanking the adds in a boss fight swapping aggro in a boss fight that incorporates a stacking debuff mechanic or in some cases is there to step in and taunt should the main tank die.With STO only the last of these is relevant and as theres no proper taunt mechanic its a case of building up threat on all the targets as the main tank does their thing. This works in a twofold manner  it can relieve a little pressure on Main Tank bringing their ATPS down to a more easily manageble number and it means that if the MT should die as oft happens in HSE then the OT is next in line on the threat table.What you do in a pug Topa is more akin to the old definition of face tanking  you dont intend to take the aggro but youre doing more damage than anyone else there and so youre the de facto tank. Rather than absorbing damage by tanking with a shield in a traditional MMO youre instead using your face to tank while you stab everything to death.,sto,d00l4xj,15,t5_2rfq3

6627702,0,t1_d04uc0h,Okay. That makes sense.It sounds like the overall weapons damage formula how your skills and items effect final outgoing damage is being left relatively untouched.Whats less clear is whether the damage formula when it comes to how targets resistances effects final incoming damage is being streamlined  your comments suggest that it is though. Perhaps in consolidation of damage resistance rating and armor penetration reductions? Thats speculating and obviously Im not expecting you to humor all of my specific questions Im mostly thinking aloud now.Obviously the range reduction is being reworked insofar as youve shifted and normalized the dropoff values themselves.Sorry just trying to get a grasp on the general shape of changes so I know how to focus tests once this hits Tribble Ive been known to try to remake the wheel otherwise.I guess my question is youre leaving weapon damage calculations largely asis its just some of the specific values and how theyre sourced are being tweaked like where you get incoming damage resistance bonuses where you get outgoing damage resistance resistance debuffs and how energy weapons suffer range reductions? Otherwise fundamental things how Crits function how bonus damage powers traits consoles should be expected to work the same?Apologies if any of that is unclear or makes no sense or strays too far into what you are or arent allowed to disclose about specific systems. ,sto,d04v0vm,3,t5_2rfq3

Its also a great place to start for new players since rstobuilds rarely with the exception of where to find useful free gear from episodes contributes to low and midgame builds to help players complete the storyline.Point being the two subs can certainly coexist as they both seek to achieve the same goal albeit in a different way.,sto,d10pepo,2,t5_2rfq3

6941933,0,t1_d11s0bj,Eve can easily have all of the negative attributes of a deadend job but I suspect it is very exciting to some of the people involved with those very large losses. All ships are human constructed and the capital and supercapitals represent significant resources. A few years ago Eve added a piratefaction capital that required RNG to obtain the plans. After one group built what might have been the first and a second group decided to try to destroy it. I imagine that the trap that led to the ships destruction was exciting to many people.Much longer ago one of the largest playerrun groups was disbanded which led to a massive fight.

Lets be honest if you dont get giddy at the thought of spending a day on the  no bloody a b c or d then youre not really a Trekker. I want the Organia thing to happen its almost certainly going to. What would I want of it? Perhaps working with a past Starfleet officer to attempt to help the Organians in the past only to have them kinda snicker point out how young we are snap their fingers and bam were all back where we came from. More megalomaniacs for the baddies. These Nakuhl are clearly extremists so show me some Dukot level craziness. An alliancemade timeship the first of its kind. While it wouldnt actually be able to time travel because of how the game works itd be awesome to make it an experimental science vessel throw in some temporal gimmicks with it and say how the temporal drive is experimental and extremely difficult to operate requiring massive amounts of computing power and energy combined with parts that can be easily damaged thus making it a use only under very specific circumstances kind of thing. And Lastly temporal recruits. The end of the FE hints at it the devs have said since Delta Recruitment ended that it was a thing theyd like to do again and I dont think any players new or old would object to it.

Our armada system allows us to go donate credits to the projects of another fleet. It is helpful to them for obvious reasons and helpful to those of us in maxed fleets or fleets that have nothing but hard dil expensive projects left as we can earn fleet credits much easier.Besides that the armada gives your fleet members a slight boost on a certain skill  such a small amount that its almost negligible and provides a larger group that you can pull from for group events  though not many fleets do that and the game doesnt provide an easy or streamlined way to interact like that with other fleets in the armada.So basically for us its a new way to get fleet credits.,sto,d2q216q,2,t5_2rfq3

7705603,0,t3_4kv9di,I can already see two problems with this UI. the inability to see which abilities are on cooldown without constantly switching between four different radial menus. the inability to chain multiple abilities to a single buttonMany players rotate between two copies of an ability by binding them to a single key this reduces the amount of muscle memory needed. Some players even bind multiple abilities of different careers to a single key.gt Captains may even cast multiple abilities in sequence this way if they keep the radial menu open allowing them to fire off a quick burst of abilities easily  a crucial timesaver that could mean the difference between victory and defeat.And what if the abilities they want to activate in sequence are located in different radial menus? What if they want to activate four or five abilities in sequence?

We were consistently told that perma and chaindisables were working as intended then when Geko was called out on it in a podcast he was flabbergasted insisted that thats not how its supposed to be and it was changed the very next week.gt Id imagine theres a decent chunk of the playerbase that doesnt even realize it exists anymore.Agreed again.I doubt that burying the PvP queues under seldom clicked menus helps either.,sto,d3wcskj,-1,t5_2rfq3

It is not shoot wait  seconds and shoot again.Please reread the statements I said change your tactics not gimp yourself. Theres a specific difference here. Also you wouldnt need to wait  seconds. Qtip times the weak shot to his full strike by a less than  second difference so he can still vape quickly.

Youd run the race collect the daily rewards then go to a vendor and trade them to buy the ship.Later we added an Event project that would accept your autographed glossy photos of Q as inputs and on completion would award you an unlock that gave you the ship.The problem is the version purchased from the store doesnt have legacy data on your character. We dont have any way to see Once upon a time you bought this item from a store but later discarded it.So we have to find a clever workaround that will let us determine that your character did in fact get the ship back in early  but you dont have it now and then give you a fixup that grants you the account unlock.Nontechnical version We have to figure out how to jiggle it so that it works.,sto,d4k6uvd,8,t5_2rfq3

This leads to his maniacal vengeance and ultimately the Battle of Procyon V which causes the death of thousands.Again I disagreed with the use of the weapon.. not to mention this is an unintended side effectgt Also by eliminating the Tulerians we cause the creation of the Sphere Builders who led the Xindi to attack Earth in  killing  million people.  Also this same event turns Noye into the Envoy who reeked havoc throughout the Temporal Cold War including working with the Nakhul and thus allowing the Nazis to almost win WWII.Im getting tired of pointing out this was done without my consent...gt Rather than destroy the Tox Uthat the second we realize it exists we allow the timetraveling idiot Kal Dano to lose it to the Tholians who promptly destroy the Nakhuls star which begins their path of vengeance which results in the temporal cold war.We kept the tox uthat to restart a star.. We didnt let the tholions steel it we attempted to stop them after all..gt Willingly aided the criminal warmonger and murderer Sela in direct violation of the Federations and Republics laws as well as betraying the trust of both on numerous occasions. Allowing Sela to roam free eventually led to her involvement with the Iconians and her attack on them in the past which in turn led to their destruction of Romulus. We are thus indirectly responsible for the destruction of Romulus by taking her back in time with us.Sela however guilty in her crimes was still misguided and influenced by the Icionions therefore even through she has commuted these crimes I would argue it was under duress.. However I am a starfleet officer. not a judge.. not a lawyer... I have no orders to arrest sela therefore I do not take the initiative in what could be an unlawful arrest.gt By our provoking the Iconians they trick the Undine into thinking that the Alpha Quadrant is attacking them so they enter into our space and devastate both Earth and Quonos.Unintentional Provocation I might add.. gt Also by provoking the Iconians the Iconians attack and destroy the Preservers and their archive probably the most valuable vault of knowledge and the most important species in the story.Unintentional side effect committed by an unstable group of people due to an Unintentional Provocation.gt Countless acts of space brutality where we act in blatant defiance of the Federations core values and kill opponents almost always shooting first.

The T Excelsior Resolute was particularly poorly received as a minimal improvement over the T version and certainly not worth going through the whole expense of full T and Fleet upgrade for what will amount to one extra boff power.  On the other hand you could get something like the Eclipse as another fast cruiser but with full Intel abilities the Arbiter both as a very good combat cruiser that also comes with a topnotch trait or get the Temporal starter pack that gives you the Paladin as another fast attack cruiser this one with full Temporal abilities plus some other stuff in the pack and only  zen instead of the usual .

Vanilla straight from the store before tweaking.What is this salvo weapon? Is it like the Vesta Aux Cannon? Can you unslot it? Is there only one equipped? Whats its fire rate? Firing arc? For example the Rapid Fire Missile Launcher is essentially a supershortcooldown torpedo with a cannons arc with damage scaled back appropriately because it does more damage than a Mk XIV beam as long as its not hitting shields and has way more uptime than real torpedoes.Right now it sounds like your Missile Boat is just an escort with the Lobi Missile Launcher equipped. Why not get a Heavy Escort Carrier for the Torpedo Defense System equip the Rapid Fire Missile Launcher and a Kelvin photon earn and slot the pilot ship trait for the automatic microtorpedo. Lots of frequent kinetic pewpew and then throw some phaser beams and turrets on for energy damage to take down shields. Weapon Synergy trait from the Manticore.Ill throw out an example of something I think has some clever mechanics and you can tell me if it meets your criteria of a newformat ship. If it doesnt Id like an equivalent example back that does meet your criteria.

This event map will only be playable during this three week event timeframe.  gt  gtIn addition to earning a choice of marks for playing the Mirror Invasion queued event players can run a new reputation project to earn a huge reward of Dilithium Marks and a unique Admiralty Card.  gt  gtAs the event begins a number of rifts open around the map and ships from the Mirror Universe begin to cross over into ours. If left unchecked the rifts will grow and launch more powerful ships. You must stop these ships before they can damage the station by either destroying the ships or by closing the rifts.  gt  gtThe station is not entirely defenseless but many of its defenses have been knocked offline in the initial salvos. There are four power substations around the map. Activate them and they will restore power to the station which will in turn bring station defenses back online.  gtImage   gtAfter the initial stage of closing rifts Vauthil Station emits an antitachyon pulse that sends the Mirror Universe ships back to their dimension. However the Terran Empire launches one final assault sending one of its special modified dreadnoughts through. These dreadnoughts have the ability to return to the Mirror Universe and will reappear through any open rift in the area.  gt  gtPlayers can earn marks by closing portals keeping the stations health high leveling up the defenses of the station and defeating the Mirror Dreadnought within the time limit. The number of marks rewarded varies based on player performance.   gt  gtOnce a day players will be awarded a Multidimensional Transporter for playing this event. By turning in  Transporters through the Reputation System players will receive  Dilithium Ore  Fleet Marks  Marks of Your Choice and a brand new unique Admiralty Card the I.S.S. Stadi!

8735834,0,t3_4zmzd0,I have a mixed bag of feelings about this. On one hand a lot of people are getting this ship something theyve wanted for a long time. On the other I think people are making it out to be better than it is. It can fit some play styles and it can be made to work but when I try to think about this ship it just feels about off both in size and stats as well as its BOff layout. And I think the first influences peoples decision on the second its become the best ship which I can point to others that are much cheaper and are in the cstore that could be made to work better. Maybe Im just bitter maybe Im not seeing some grand holy grail of a ship and instead just looking at a flaw and making it out to be a faulty point.But what ever it is Congrats to everyone who got it I really hope you enjoy it!,sto,d6xml4r,6,t5_2rfq3

Everything else is levelup junk.While you console peasants presently do not have ASS they CLAIM they will get around to it eventually. With that in mind I strongly advise you pick your levelup ships with an eye towards the future.Always choose in order of priority by whats available to your fraction. Science Ship If its got Science in the name or has a Cdr Sci slot pick this first. No exceptions.. Romulan Cruiser If youre a Romulan and are offered a cruiser pick this as your next priority if no science ship is offered.. Bird of Prey If youre KDF and dont have a science ship Voquv offered pick the BoP.Dont lose any of these yet! You will regret it! Hang onto them until you get your ASScards...whenever they implement that.Note that these choices are completely without regards to what you might want to fly. As you may have noticed you wont be using them very long and only the future thus matters.gt Is there a way to make a ensign ship into a more powerful ship!?If youre particularly attached to the skin of a particular ship a fair number of lowertier ships are reincarnated as high level endgame counterparts in the form of Retrofit editions that can look the same but meet the standards of endgame ships instead.

The longer a frigate or fighter is in combat the more powerful it becomes gaining increased shields hull and damage with fighters dying so easily the experience they gain in combat is lost so when a new fighter spawns it starts out with none of the boosts but frigates on the other hand are alot tougher allowing them to keep the boosts running much longer alot of the time none of the frigates will even die through a full missionpve.Theres also a few npcs who use beam fire at will this will almost instantly destroy your fighters making them useless as they have such a small health bar.,sto,d7ovfsh,2,t5_2rfq3

8976908,0,t1_d7qty6m,Early days of STO PVP was amazing. Playing a mode like capture and hold. Uncloaking in a GalDread and BuffLancing an enemy to take control of a point....Ah so fun. And yes Power creep very much killed PVP and turned it into something People no longer wanted to play. So it didnt just kill it for me it killed it for  of those that enjoyed it. As I read somewhere on this Forum its no longer Power Creep Its power Leap.Starting fresh is a BIG plus for sure. It took how long to get fleet holdings up to par? Spire holdings for access to Locators? etc. All these things changed the game. and destroyed not only PVP but the way PVE maps play out. Advanced ISA for instance had a  rule Pop them all at onceetc. Now its a Joke. We kill everything too fast. I figure Ill support it again on Console until they break it again. Which may take a year or so if they still plan to release everything to be on par with PC. At that point I may quit the game again. Well see. As it is its so much fun right now flying an EscortDestroyer with a pad to be sure ATM.ALSO the  all too easy maps to play so why play any other Que maps arent in the game Infected Space and Crystalline. Which gives other maps gametime. If I was in charge I wouldnt re release them as is. because without them all maps are more equal. Id also NOT release all the crap. Locators Inspirational leader Embassy Sci consoles Plasmonic leech for all etc. Make Factions different again. IMO Plasmonic Leech should be a Romulan only Console actually. to balance their power Issue. But Im sure the Console version will be just as bad as PC version is right now. but its gonna take long enough to get there that itll be worth investing in for at least a year.,sto,d7qvzev,2,t5_2rfq3

Be happy that there are knuckleheads like us that like to buy keys.   As others have mentioned you can work your butt off and trade dilithium for zen and buy keys as an alternative.  Thats what makes this game great. If you really want something pay for someone elses luck...  The contents of the lock box are tradable and are regularly sold on the exchange by other players who have received said items and want to sell them for Energy Credits.  If there is something you really want sell the keys on the exchange and use the EC to buy that item from another person.

There arent any TU ships I would choose over those two Ts.On my Romulan Fed however there are very few options for T ships and looking through the forums and DPS league even on PC the Scimitar TU has beenis one of the top ships available.And Im loving my RomTU Scimitar using largely the same equipment I was using on the Kelvins the Scimitar is seemingly doing just as much Damage and having no problems with survivability even though Ive got about k less Hull and k Less shields on the Scim not necessarily all inherent slightly different builds affecting that.Granted the access to intel powers like Override Subsystem Safeties and Surgical Strikes makes for some bigger numbers during bursts have hit up to k in Intel Dread with some shots vs topping out at k in the scimitar so far though The Rom is only  right now and still has alot of stuff to work on.But taking the Scimitar into PVP as well as the events and alerts Im doing much better than alot of the T ships i see on my romulan!,sto,d9bmpzg,0,t5_2rfq3

The classes are VERY fixed. Its not a skilltreebased game where you define your class purely based on the skills you pick ingame nor is there any way to change your character class after creation. While it is true that classes play a relatively minor role in space compared to your selection of ship and build which are fairly mutable the classes themselves are fixed in stone and have quite a significant effect on ground that you cant change in any way.,sto,d9nvxbk,0,t5_2rfq3
9531484,0,t3_5betkw,tldr any class can achieve overwhelmingly good dps to complete all PvE content. Being a tactical officer is only required if you wish to be a best of the best space wizard. The answer depends on how far you wish to push your dps. The main boost in dps does not come from which class you choose or what ship you command. Rather it comes from your how you build your ship and how well you control your ship in battle. Focusing on these two areas will raise your dps to the kk level. With this dps level you should be able to easily complete most featured episode missions on elite as well as run most elite queued events. If you wish to achieve best of the best in dps levels gtk dps then being a tactical officer and commanding a good ship matters greatly. You will also require at least a billion dilithium and a billion energy credits to purchaseupgrade all the esoteric stuff required to achieve this level of dps. ,sto,d9nyezd,3,t5_2rfq3

9597074,0,t3_5cf7sq,Welcome welcome glad to see someone else interested in this aspect of STO. While I am not the end all be all in regards to RP in STO I do lead a small group of RPers in game and as such I hope I can get you some answers to your questions.In response to the question in the title I personally go with legit fun but then again I may be biased. gtHow deep do fleets usually go with this? Well in the sense of utilizing obscure trek lore and trivia it will vary person to person and fleet to fleet. As well as youll find varying levels of headcanonfanon when it comes to RPers adn RP fleets.gtHow deep do fleets usually go with this?The answer to this is yes. I know I know mathematicians answer and all that. To elaborate most RP fleets are out of character OOC federation aligned which is just keeping in line wit the overall player demographics. And how much a RP fleet ties themselves to the STO plot will vary greatly. Some only do RPs based off the current events or that are closely tied to said events. Others try to distance themselves as far from the base events as they can. While most look to at least acknowledge the plot of STO. Similarly while most fleets are OOC fed aligned in character IC you will find a wide variance with some running independent research stations PMCs unaffiliated colonies ShipRP groupsfleets as well as the standard starfleet officer groupings. There are even a few that RP in either the TOS or TNG eras specifically. So you have plenty to choose from to suit your specific tastes.gtWhat is considered important or the social customs?This again will vary from fleet to fleet. But a few general rulesguidelines would be No GodModding No ICOOC drama bleedover generally being respectful and nonjudgemental of others RP backgroundspersonas and finally remember that you are not the only PC out there dont try to steal the spotlight all the time.In general fleets will have their own RP rules guidelines and policies. A few other tips Id offer these are not hard and fast rules just a few things Ive observed over the years  Avoid MarySueGaryStuism. Most people will have  things they excel in a rare individual may have  things but no one is going to be perfect in every way. . Try to build up your idea of the characters personalityies and stick to them without being totally inflexible. This will make it easier and more natural for you to RP the characters but there will need to be some give and take in any group. . Find a group to help get you introduced into the larger RP community and dont be afraid to go meet other characters in game.Depending on when youre mainly active Id be glad to chat more with you ingame. Im based out of the US East coast GMT and am generally on most evenings. JeremyDanielsLooking forward to seeing you out around the stars!,sto,d9w1ad8,4,t5_2rfq3

The DSDs and Vestas are better overall but it takes a little more work to make reliable workhorses out of them compared to the tougherhulled Nebula.The T version will have stiff competition out of the gate from the Eternal and Nautilus with the Eternal especially already having very similar stats to the Nebula plus both full Temporal spec and MMSV features but the Sutherland will likely end up being a very solid Science Vessel for players who prefer more traditional Starfleet designs much as the ArchonVizier is somewhat inferior to the Chronos or Yorktown but yet still is a Sovereign.,sto,daalzag,2,t5_2rfq3

9752244,0,t3_5eu6f5,The only thing you might be missing is that Tier  ships that come in threepacks and cross faction packs are already fleet level quality. This means they have slightly more hit points and shields and an extra console compared to the regular CStore ships. Oh and ships that are full spec e.g. have a Commander Hybrid seat usually tends to have a specrelated perk that never really gets compensated on for nonfullspec ships. Though the Command Spec ability is generally not that awesome since it takes so long until is active.So some of the stats might be better because youre comparing two different levels within Tier . Other aspects might be however be entirely based on your personal play style. Command is generally seen as weaker then Intel or Temporal for specialization bridge officer abilities but some abilities are quite good for certain types of builds. Concentrate Firepower for torpedo builds Rally Point for healers and tanks Suppression Barrage for debuffers. ,sto,daf6isc,5,t5_2rfq3

9839835,0,t1_dap6971,There is no logical reason why the RMT Crowd meaning people who do NOT pay money into the game would ever desire a higher rateBasically you dont understand RMT in STO at all. They dont make money when ZEN is cheap they make money when their cash sales are a better option than ZEN sales to players who spend cash.Players earn and sell Dilithium for ZEN. RMT players earn and sell Dilithium for more Dilithium. There is nothing natural about the upward equilibrium of the Dilithium exchange because the highest Dilithium earners in the game use all of their wealth solely to achieve higher Dilithium prices. If those same Dilithium earners were players they would seek a downward equilibrium  in fact that is exactly what happened until Feb  the history of the in game economy shows this.Prior to late Feb.  in STO the highest Dilithium earners in the game were players not RMT traders because rep marks was the primary means to earn the highest amount of Dilithium at the fastest pace. That changed beginning in Feb  and if you know what happened then you know exactly why April   was the last day Dilithium was below . It was all about the rep mark the Dilithium currency of players not RMT sellers.When Admiralty was released in October  and more specifically by December  the RMT crowd realized they could earn K Dilithium per day per account in only  hours of game time requiring absolutely no gear whatsoever only leveraging systems. And the Dilithium exchange has been completely controlled by RMT traders every since.The natural upward equilibrium only exists because the top Dilithium earners in the game who use the Dilithium exchange are RMT players who want the price high. But before Feb.  all the top Dilithium earners in the game were active players and as a result prior to Feb.  the exchange rate for Dilithium was never above .,sto,daq5jkm,3,t5_2rfq3

10125757,0,t3_5kxak1,Console players should be getting the Agents of Yesterday expansion in . However the question is when you will get it. Along with that expansion there are ships related to that expansion which are mostly for the Fed faction. But there is the st Century Temporal Cross Faction bundle which includes a dreadnought cruiser science ship and raider. If you play all  factions then it kinda like getting  ships for the price of  ships.That expansion will also introduce a new story arc called New Frontiers with the first mission in that arc called Echoes of Light. Eventually that will introduce  more sectors in the Alpha Quadrant for new content. Naturally the PC will get the new content first... and its related bugs...New missions related to the New Frontiers story arc should be available for the PC starting with the February Anniversary Event in February . However consoles will not be getting that content at that time. It will likely not happen until later next year... Probably a  month delay so that Cryptic can fix bug issues and potential game balance issues on the PC first before releasing the content for consoles.It is possible Agents of Yesterday will be released when the Anniversary Event starts in Feb  for the consoles.,sto,dbre51n,1,t5_2rfq3
10127466,0,t1_dbrjwt6,That depends on how much you enjoy the game. The more captains you have the more valuable the Lifetime Membership will be. With a membership every time you rank up you will receive  bank slots and  personal slot up until you reach level . Not sure if you get those extra slots when you rank up from level  to level  though.For argument sake lets say after level  you do not get anymore slots. That means you will have  more bank inventory slots and  more personal inventory slots at level  compared to a free to play player.  bank inventory slots costs  Zen to purchase from the CStore and  personal inventory slot costs  Zen to purchase. That means with a Lifetime Membership that captain will receive  Zen worth of bank  personal inventory slots. Multiply that the number of captains you have. You should also get  more captain slot. At least that how it works on the PC.There are other perks as well like each captain getting a Retrain Token at every rank increase. Each of those are worth  Zen. Then there are the extra Boff slot you can get as you rank up as well. Each captain will receive  extra shipyard slots and I think you may get a couple of ship slots.There are other things as well... However I recommend you wait until it goes on sale AND after Cryptic releases more content.,sto,dbrm54t,1,t5_2rfq3

10264666,0,t3_5mu7pj,I did the race and DOFFing for the winter items on both PC and PS. Once I got the ship on console as Im sorely lacking ships and have determined to not spend any real world currency on the console after investing so much in PC after almost  years I leveled to  thanks to the bonus XP month. I do like playing in my living room on a large tv but the controls are sorely lacking i find it frustrating to do a lot of things. Typed chat is a nightmare. Adding players to the fleet is a challenge because you cant grab their name from chat I end up taking a quick cameraphone snap and selling on the Exchange is probably the most frustrating as you have to look up the exact phrase on the BUY side in order to know what to sell it at. In the end I just discard everything as the Exchange is not up to snuff yet. And because of that Im only sitting on K EC  Sorry I know this wasnt intended to be a console gripes post.

At all. Check the time code goes from  to  with no movement from the patrol.But fine broken but the accolade is still doable at this point.Until I reach Ensign Svoboda.Shes red and hostile I try to get close and talk but......she starts attacking midconvo...And so now the accolade is impossible to finish.And for the next group the ones by the cargocontainers who  if memory serves  are supposed to walk around giving you a chance to slip past undetectedFrom  to  no movement from Ensign Redshirt.

10817746,0,t3_5uotbv,gtgtIncrease the fun  Games are about having fun and players should not be made to feel that their fun is wrong.This is fine so long as it doesnt mean make success random as we see in a lot of FPS shooters these days.  Dont take the importance of skill and strategy out of the game.  If this means theyre going to buff weaker gear abilities etc. so that theyre viable and players can be successful using stuff thats currently considered garbage thats good.  gtgtPlayer investment retains value  While things need to be adjusted a setup that was optimized before should still be useful and effective afterwards.i.e. Focus on buffing the weak rather than nerfing the strong.  This is generally a good idea for any MMO rebalancing.  However its interesting that one of their first changes is a pretty big nerf to tactical initiative although it does fix what was a borderline exploit.  Another rule of MMOs is to nerf exploits fast or accept them as a valid game mechanic for all time.  Tactical initiative should have been fixed long ago.  gtgtChoices should be meaningful  Anywhere the game gives you a choice there should be no choice that you always take nor one you never take.Lets face it everyone chases DPS to a certain extent if only so they can feel competent enough to join a PVE queue without feeling like an anchor on their team.  It really does feel like there are only a couple of viable paths to respectable DPS in STO and most decisions you make for fun or roleplay only hurt you.  For example even though choice of abilities and ship build can make a bigger impact than anything else youre always going to feel like youre a little bit suboptimal in space if youre not a romulan tactical captain.  Thats not good.Its pretty clear that STO tried to take the approach of making captain profession meaningless so that players can choose what they want for roleplay reasons and not worry about it.  No need to start over on a new toon if you realize you made the wrong choice later on!  Attack Pattern Alpha APA henceforth screwed that pooch unfortunately.  Just a little.  Just the tip.  But the pooch is screwed nonetheless!  You know what Im not a huge fan of captain class being meaningless.  Id like to see a little bit of differentiation.  Maybe science captains should have some skills that work with exotic damage skills similar to APA and maybe tactical captains should be more weapon focused i.e. perhaps APA shouldnt buff exotic damage.  Maybe engineers should actually have something that makes their ships better tanks...  or something.  They really are the most screwed over class in space right now.  As for Romulans... It really comes down to Superior Romulan Operatives standing head and shoulders above every other BOFF space skill out there.  In fact all BOFF space skills other than SRO or pirate suck dingo balls right now.  Buff those and you give players a lot of meaningful choices to make. ,sto,ddvrvt2,6,t5_2rfq3

11080409,0,t3_5y64jf,Well.... deep breathCaptain AbilitiesId put a minimum cooldown of half the powers base cooldown on every captain power.  uptime on Attack Pattern Alpha is kind of silly and gives Tacs an enormous advantage considering they have the best I said it captain powers. Tactical CaptainsId change Attack Pattern Alphas All damage to Weapon damage. Tacs doing more exotic damage than Scis just because of APA is kind of silly. Mind you itd STILL be one of the best captain powers. Id change Tactical Initiative to last  seconds along with the other Cmdr rank powers. Engineering CaptainsRotate Shield Frequency would get a serious buff because its very lacking. Nadion Inversion is also meh and Id give it a numbers buff of some kind. Id give Miracle Worker a small  Eng power CDR when used. This can get kind of spammy though under the right setup so need to be careful with it cough uTilorfire coughScience CaptainsPhotonic Fleet would spawn more impressive ships. Maybe improve the AI here to use its abilities more? Sensor Scan would be AOE and have a Damage Resistance Reduction attached. FAWI dont think its a bad thing to have a power like FAW around but its power drain mechanics need to be...refined. If I was both the balance designer AND a supersmart software engineer Id refactor FAW such that it drains  more weapons power drain per shot e.g. . power instead of  for a standard beam. It already kind of does this but its unreliable and more like . This would increase the importance of having sufficient overcap and EPS to power FAW. Relatively small nerf tbh.Beam OverloadThis needs something. If the powerdrain mechanic is still around remove it. If not allow its damage multiplier to scale off of CrtH.Torps and cannonsIncrease all torps flight speed by approximately  except the Kelvin Photons. Same goes for cannon particles but probably not as much of a buff. SpecializationsGround and space specializations would be broken out into a separate ground and space specialization one primarysecondary for ground one primarysecondary for space. Same with active reputation traits.Embassy ConsolesPlasma Explosions no longer ignore shields. Im pretty sure they still do. That is silly.Attrition WarfareNerf the CDR to . I dont want to completely wreck the power but right now theres no reason to run anything thats not an AW build.  Feedback PulseI think the current state of Feedback Pulse is kind of silly and warps the meta around Threat and max science console slots. Id probably try something more extreme like changing its base from ... of damage reflected back to .... This would be a substantial nerf to feedback pulse so maybe those numbers would need to change.NPCsBoost the bigger NPC power levels so they are basically benefiting from the same sort of buffs that player ships get. E.g. an NPC Astika gets  weapons power  shield  engine power. This would be a relatively small buffwith the implications of making enemies a bit tougher without inflating their hitpoints. Giant nonplayable ships like the Borg CubeTactical CubeIaidon Dreadnought would get  weaponsshieldsaux power permanently. Those seem to be the biggest offenders in PvE. Note that I have no experience in PvP and wouldnt want to try balancing for that. My goals were as follows Increase build diversity. Make torpscannons more viable. Cannons are honestly in a pretty good spot but torps could use some love outside of CCA. Decrease disparity between captain careers. Tacs have it really good right now. Probably a little too good. Reduce mustslot powers. There will always be the best gearskills but FAW Embassy Consoles Feedback Pulse and AW are running pretty rampant and crowding out other options.

11121894,0,t3_5ysvu1,Antiprotons beams are wellliked because they always have a Critical Severity bonus. So if you want to make a highcritical build they are indeed a good choice. Plenty to recommand the other energy damage types though so you can a very good build with any type of weapons.The fact that you have several energy weapon types antiproton plasma disruptor will mean that you will not be able to really maximize your damage output because if you put per example a tactical console xx beam damage the bonus will be less than if you put a tactical console dedicated to a specific damage type like xx antiproton damage. Mixing several weapon types is not optimal.Mixing beams and torpedoes may be unnecessary also  your beam weapons if chosen well and supported by good traits and consoles can deliver such damage that you just wont need a torpedo.And no you wont keep earning levels after .

11127789,0,t1_det2a49,The two cases are not comparable whatsoever.The Lukari Reputation Energy Weapons are weapons that deal a type of Energy damage and benefit from all bonuses that will affect Energy Weapons or the various subsets of Energy Weapon damage that they fit. The Lukari Reputation Torpedo is a weapon that deals a standard damage type used by Projectile Weapons and that benefits from all bonuses that affect Projectile weapons or the various subsets of Projectile Weapon Damage that it fits. The proc is guaranteed to happen comes directly from the weapon and deals a type of Energy Damage. Due to this making the weapon do direct Exotic Damage is a bad thing because Exotic was as I commented at the time originally defined as damage not caused by weapons.The lance on this ship is not Weapon Damage does not deal a type of Energy Damage and cannot benefit from any buffs limited to any subset of Weaponry. It is Exotic Radiation Damage. There is no part of the lance that is in any way directly able to be tied to being a weapon any more than Structural Integrity Collapse could be. There is no inconsistency in allowing this lance to scale with Exotic Particle Generators or Exotic Damage boosts.,sto,detbq3b,5,t5_2rfq3

Making it a pershot basis instead of a per cycle basis later on made them woefully imbalanced.  There was no other choice for those slots and the SCIENCE consoles as they exist now on Holodeck favor Tac Captains at magnitudes far higher than any other Captain career path.Now if were talking about slightly increasing the current Tribble proc damage on a percycle basis and said damage is NOT shield bypassing I can support that.,sto,df4j59d,2,t5_2rfq3

Its further complicated by being competitive. If too few people queue up youll end up with very poor matchmaking. Frustrating anyone on the losing end.

11494690,0,t1_dfyngtj,There are other things to do than farm Argala.  Argala was the patrol of choice postDR but other patrolsactivities can reward nearly as much XP.Borg Red Alerts are really good although they take longer to pop than they did even a few months ago.  The Romulan patrols can earn XP Japori especially are relatively quick and give a small amount of Romulan marks to boot.Some of the story missions offer decent equipment rewards that can be farmed Solonae and Earth Defense sets come to mind I found the Jem Hadar ground set from the Cardassian Arc to be a decent set of gear for boffs.  I agree that a rebalance would be good but the last time they tried to rebalance they upped the HP on the enemies and...did nothing else.  More HP does not make for more challenging content just longer content that requires more DPS to complete.New queues that die off quickly often have time gates that turn people off.

DrainX casually not to mention that on hangar builds we need to activate Rapid Fire amp Co. instead for Dominion Coordination. and even a situational usefulness of them would suk for us console players as activating anything out of the multiple different clumsy laggy and ship control disabling ability wheels instead of using an auto execute setting is a true pain we already reserve for as few truly worth it necessities as possible. so  goodbye all Target Subsystems out of almost all my builds including cannonbuild  OmniBeam escorts destroyers with tonns of dedicated tac. slots carriers and most sci. vessels.   actually this whole change  making Target Subsystems usable on cannons while making it and its in some ships inbuilt variants share CD with all energy weapon enhancement abilities in turn which is probably just a sad poor try of buffing it and making it getting used more will have an amazingly absurd impact on console STO it ensures that dedicated hangar builds would be better if the ships they are on wouldnt have  of them inbuilt like all dedicated Carriers seem to have it. yup  BETTER without it inbuilt. was already true for dedicated hangar build beamboats on console now it will become true for cannon turret equivalents as well  why? first of all every good dedicated hangar build on console usually has Dominion Coordination on as the Jem Dread where that trait is from and Keldon are always available plentiful on console as our Dominion Lockbox contains extraordinary amounts of Superior Universal Prototype Tech Upgrades  TP with no Dil. cost and x rarity increase chance and mining claims same is true to a slightly lesser extent for our version of the Kelvin Lockbox as well as all Lockbox drop events are held frequently here  so those get opened in the bazzillions here and as a result the trait is easily available here. secondly dedicated hangar builds with Dominion Coordination cannot frequently use inbuilt or any Target Subsystems that now share CD with all energy weapon enhancement abilities as Target Subsystems doesnt trigger Dominion Coordination like some other energy weapon enhancement abilities doagainst more damage dealing enemies they could only be used at all on full Scramble Fighters invincibility builds that are seldom and hard to execute on console as managing  hangar bays every  seconds would require inabilitywheel action every few seconds which would disable our control of everything not in that   ability wheels for like half the  sec. cycle in average. thirdly hitting the right ability field in a hurry can be problematic in our ability wheels when they are packed cluttered too much  as the more abilities in the wheel the smaller the ability icon fields get. and none of our  ability wheels in space is more packed than the one the four different inbuilt Target Subsystems are in. so there we have it our carriers special power will be having four abilities inbuilt they mostly cannot use because they are carriers on console  and because they are console STO carriers they get even less good to control for even just having those four mostly unusuable abilities on those ships and we lack the highly desired option to organize the ability wheels ourselves.  this is some truly stupid garbage IMO. make inbuilt Target Subsystems sets not share cooldown with anything but itself please  its meant to be a bonus to those ships they are on after all! and while were at it could my Jupiter sci. vessel and carrier now finally please get the Sensor Analysis it deserves since ever since its already missing a secondary deflecor for being a fullfledged Carrier as well  but the inbuilt Target Subsystems it would have gotten for even just being a carrier even if it wouldnt have been a sci. vessel on top of it!? and by sci. vessel i dont just mean sci. variant of like a Flagship or Command Cruiser trio but actual science vessel including science ship admiralty card and everything... . ,sto,dgq02tq,1,t5_2rfq3

The Specialization Point Box requires the opening character to be level  or above.  gt  gtThis Combat Armor is the result of many attempts at creating a more protective but productive armor for the Kentari military. The armor is designed to infuse the wearer with increased capacity to take damage rather than waste profits on more durable materials. Additionally when used with other Kentari designed gear the excessive power can be further modulated to protect the wearer.

They will take their free drink maybe complain about it a little bit and then try and collect their thoughts and get your part.  They wont complain oh...its a bit too sour so I feel like dying today.And this isnt just well shes frightened out of her mind I used to be a bartender.  People that have just been through tough crap are LESS picky not more.  They just want a good hit to try and numb themselves a little and regain control or drown it completely.,sto,dgxrg4o,20,t5_2rfq3
