The diplomats were dressed in fine robes of yellow and orange and dark reds trailing down their arms and along their legs onto the dirt. Their long dark black hair swept down their shoulders and their strong jaws were remnants of the many tribal bloods that had mingled with the people of Cao. These were the Visionaries of the Emperor carrying with them each a tome of the Cao Dynasty wrapped in fine silks binded in ropes and rolled up in their bamboo forms. The soldiers were very different. Each wore armour of a lizard scales all over their torsos with round bamboo shields and swords curved and spears sharp coloured in light blacks and greys. These were the overseas force of the Cao Dynasty intended not only to impress but to intimidate their own dark hair tied at the back their eyes surrounded by black dyes.The diplomats were humble and were proud to announce themselves as symbols of the Cao Dynasty the great empire of the west that rivalled all others the largest and most beautiful to ever exist. They were proud to meet the people of Harakaite and offered to them the many tomes that compiled The Written History of the Qin State The Documented History of the Zhao Empire and The Documented History of the Lo Empire as well as the tomes that formed The Winter and Dusk Annals telling of a dark time of division and strife within their nation before they were united into what they now are  the Cao Dynasty.Another thing presented to this nation were the written language of the Qin people the numerical and mathematical systems used by the Qin and of course the great The Annals of Zhshng the code by which the people of the civilised world lived. The Cao diplomats quickly spread to organise the army into something impressive and neat while a single diplomat Zhan Ke continued to speak with the people of Harakaite eager to learn all he could of their land.,HistoricalWorldPowers,cku49yq,1,t5_324a3

2692901,0,t3_2qoif6,   BCEUnionShared ResearchErosion Control  The Hatan Gols silty nature is as much a curse as it is a blessing.  In times of bad flood its waters can wash away the shoreline creating mudslides as the river and its tributaries run their course to the sea.  To help combat the runoff large rocks intermixed with gravel are used to line the shoreline to shield and hold back the earth from torrents while trees and grasses are planted above the shoreline to hold the ground firmly with their roots.Carrier Birds The raising of pigeons in Hatan has made for an interesting development.  After years of raising the birds the great lengths pigeons could be taken from their coop and let loose only to return to their nest has been noted.  Using advanced feeding paces the birds can even be trained to fly between two points.  One day a nobleman had the brilliant idea to tie a note to the birds leg and a revolution was born.  Flying all over busy little birds carry messages all over Hatan are being used by government military and citizenry alike.  Realizing the importance of such developments its readily shared with the other states in Zhongqin.  In a monumental event a message was sent between Dorkot Hatan and Kenyama Harakaite.  Sending the bird out one morning it delivered its message in Harakaite later in the evening two days later.  Though the animals appear to trail the coast to avoid most of the open water they are certainly quicker than by ship or horse.The Khitan are currently exploring other avian options for messaging such as hawks but for now those in Hatan are quite happy with their accomplishment.  Exporting them such a development to the rest of Qin will surely only bring those in the Zhongqin Union closer together.M So much Pigeon.  Mike Tyson would be proud.

I had decent relations with Liguria and Rhovanion. Cornwall Saxony and Poland were enemies with me for quite awhile. Over in Africa they all disliked me for unknown reasons as I hadnt really done much to them.Internally my land was made up of chieftains who held different parts of the land. The important chieftains were the chieftains of Toulouse Bordeaux Montpellier Paris and Nantes. The capital was Nantes for a long time however I moved it to Toulouse which was meant to be a shining beacon of culture and advancement in Europe.The only reason people are hostile to the term Bretagne is because I was a bit of a cunt when it came to out of RP talking.

Israel was united by faith and once again by larger powers in the region. gtbecoming a vassal is their best optionNot many people in this game play based on whats best for their nation and people though.,HistoricalWorldPowers,covhz73,1,t5_324a3

Raw materials tend to come from the Atlas Cities and foreign ports but intercity commerce is still mostly intact since so many of the Caliphates cities are still neutral.  The coastal cities are able to produce equipment including food fairly effectively for Ughizhyrvalais men.  Having access to the majority of the Caliphates navy Ughizhyrvalai also enjoys the use of the assamtissat ballistae and onagers that were loaded on those ships these siege weapons can also be deployed on land.  The mayor of Misrata offers the more positive response of the two mayors though both give Ughizhyrvalai essentially the same message they appreciate his words but want to see them acted upon.  The majority of Tuareg leaders around  seem to favor Aylimas but another quarter of the leaders and their tribes recognize and respect Ughizhyrvalais piety.  Over this period Ughizhyrvalais army grows to about  men including  members of the standing army  nomadic warriors and  militiamen and recruits from those cities favoring him.  Meanwhile rumors state that fighting has broken out near Hassi win Hamada the other two contestants for the throne must be clashing with each other.

5001421,0,t1_cuo2t99,M how does one just tear down a concrete and stone wall that is ft at the base and ft tall at the top and ft high?  Without any large scale siege stuff?The eagle reached Toulouse and the commander of the southern guard knew what she must do.  She sent word to the rest of the guard on the southern wall further away from the invasion.  The guard near the point of breach were to quietly cut off any retreat by going over the wall and blocking the exit.  The Toulouse guard would make a half circle around the point of breach and would then push in as one unit.  The order was simple no one would escape no one would be spared.  It was harsh but Francian blood was spilled by bandits that wore no colors of the land to the south from whence they came. The brothers and sisters of Francia who fell on their shields will be honored.  At dawn the attack was ordered by a single eagle flying overhead.  It wasnt a fair fight and it wasnt pretty.  Those who did not try to escape were slaughtered as were those trying to escape.  Only thirteen made it back over the wall and all were met by  Francian Guard with readied bows.  They were gathered a long with the rest of the dead and as is the custom of Francia honored friend and foe alike.  For blood was shed and those spirits must be honored.  For is the Francian way on Francian land. Note Not a single Francian breached the border as the wall was built about  meters from the border.M I will start the diplomacy post tomorrow,HistoricalWorldPowers,cuouxhv,1,t5_324a3

Yet your point is well raised and understood. It seems we have reached an impasse.The Khan leant back in his seat rubbing his forehead softly as he whispered Mongolic to his aid who was quick to write each word down and then rush off as the Khan waved his hand. Ibn Yemijun Khan stood and looked at the men down before him.I have sent a messenger to Chalukya. It may take a few days. You will be given room and board within this city as we await a response. I have chosen to ask Chalukya directly if they feel there is a need to rectify the treaty and if so what they would like rectified. Once I have received a response I will make my final verdict. I apologise for this delay. Please take care in the following nights.With that they were ushered away and the Khan took his seat down on his wooden throne. What a mess.M Im gonna PM uEngishark for a private answer and I will then make a new post in here that will hopefully end all of this once and for all. ,HistoricalWorldPowers,d1zh9oc,1,t5_324a3
