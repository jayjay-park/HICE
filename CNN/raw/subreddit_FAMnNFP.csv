Ill check out some of the methods mentioned here to see how they line up with Weschlers book which is currently my guide and Ill try to find a thermometer with a memory that I can afford. I bought one but the memory retrieval didnt work... sigh.  Theres a great new thermometer coming out that you can wear under your armpit at night called TempDrop but for  and a spring  delivery date I think Ill stick with something from CVS!,FAMnNFP,cyu3r7j,1,t5_2w7u3
