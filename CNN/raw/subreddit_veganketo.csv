6071873,0,t1_cyfh2hm,I appreciate the comment  I practice an intermittent fast schedule of  warrior fast though. Its what works for me... my body may be conditioned to it from a few deployments. Who knows. I have a  hour window usually from  every day depending on my schedule. Lost  pounds in  on strict keto from  to  then modified for maintenance. Keto is tough in AfghanistanIraq This last year was just a bad one I was drinking too much plus eating straight garbage around the clock. So this is getting my ass back to business. The new twist for me is eliminating animal products.  ,veganketo,cyfidk3,1,t5_2ujnp

6588426,0,t3_45wbnm, Not sure if I have any speeches or anything but I am looking at the dates for when you lost weight March  September. I am noticing that I usually do well with diet and lose weight from March  October. I am trying to identify what about those dates makes me have more control over my diet and how I can transfer that to the rest of the year.For me some reasons I seem to lose weight better this time of year are  public revelation of body image through wearing clothing more suited for warm weatherswimming  ability to go outside for quick walks after just throwing on sandals no need to bundle up to stay warm  more social interaction  I have more annual events and festivals I attend in this time which keeps my mind occupied with things other than food...My list could go on and I think I will write it out today!! but maybe this thought exercise will help you too!,veganketo,d00spdf,2,t5_2ujnp
6697268,0,t3_44zbm3,I just started my keto and Im already on day  and I average about  carbs per day. Breakfast is Tofu scramble. I take a block of tofu after pressing out the liquid and sprinkle turmeric garlic powder salt and pepper and saut it in a pan to get the spices to really stick to it. Then I add sauted mushrooms and spinach. Thats usually my breakfast for the week. I portion it out and it ends up being about a  cup tofu for breakfast. I will add a half slice of daiya swiss cheese to it and that makes it a total of about  carbs for breakfast. Lunch I have been trying to get really creative. One day I had buffalo cauliflower in lettuce cups. I also made a sauted brussel sprout and kale salad that I drizzled some tahini dressing onto.  For dinner Ive had the brussel sprouts again spaghetti squash with a basil avocado sauce so delicious and that was about  carbs for dinner and I was super full.  You probably have to stay away from the meat substitutes as they are mostly wheat based which is going to be carby. I figured I will do this hardcore just to get into ketosis and then I can go back to  carbs once Im in.  ,veganketo,d0c205d,1,t5_2ujnp

11082184,0,t1_deo1trw,What I get out of keto personally is feeling full and satisfied while eating at a deficit due to the fats and proteins. Normally if I ate at a deficit Id gp through the hungry all the time period before my stomach shrank. ,veganketo,deo5m80,5,t5_2ujnp
11124655,0,t3_5vwulq,The one thing I found out about myself is that the more carbs I are the more I wanted them. Eating lower carbs during the day keeps me satisfied and keeps the cravings at bay. Ive been a vegan for a year now ,veganketo,desyxxh,2,t5_2ujnp

11407571,0,t1_dfhvzvf,These are great reads! Ive just been on keto leaning vegan but not exclusively for a few weeks myself. I think allowing yourself a second meal and finding some more satisfying mealssnacksdesserts would make it significantly easier and even desirable to stick with. I struggle w enough variety even adding Vital Farms eggs and occasionally canned salmon so I know going straight vegan is even harder. But scrambles w FYH Vegan egg and avocado or almond flour pancakes or taco bowls seasoned veg over spinach w avocado or curries over cauliflower rice make actual meals that make you feel a bit more sane. Your mention of excessive coffee at the end there has reminded me that my intake has gone up partly because Im not as sensitive to it in keto before even one cup would give me anxietyheart palpitations. I am v interested in trying a week or two off of it but staying in keto. ,veganketo,dfp19b9,2,t5_2ujnp
