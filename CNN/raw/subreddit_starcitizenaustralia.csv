960361,0,t1_chd7t0i,At the same time would be nice to know who we have as potential friends. My suggestion Ask affiliates if they are okay with their other orgs being listed on sheet or make another sheet with the affiliates on and leave it up to them to fill in their other orgs there if they so wish.,starcitizenaustralia,chdga6v,2,t5_2vljh
988920,0,t1_chgoyrt,Honestly in terms of ease its probably just easier to get Discovery as its easier to just createjump on a server. The official global server that used to track servers is long since dead. Ive played it relatively recently with the missus just hosting on my LAN.  I just slap the V. patch on slap a nocd crack on  the game should generate a multiplayer ID for you so you shouldnt need a keygen. If youre planning on hosting over the net youll most likely need to forward some ports on your router to your server and youll need to get people to connect to your IP address via the command line  freelancer.exe s... substituting the ... for whatever your IP is.  Then its just a matter of firing up the server software.,starcitizenaustralia,chgp4d1,2,t5_2vljh

3948653,0,t3_350ubh,So what have people done so far I traded in my anniversary SF for a SFG. As I see it this ship will come in very handy for my org for anything like refueling our Orions our exploration ships or for our heavy haulers. One of our guys was thinking we could park it in the org hanger and offer free fuel to our member. Interesting concept. Hopefully all this will be possible ,starcitizenaustralia,cr6dpkm,1,t5_2vljh
