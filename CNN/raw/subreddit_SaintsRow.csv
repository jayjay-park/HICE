337060,0,t3_1wn5ew,If you liked Saints Row  you may like Saints Row  since its basically SRSuper PowersAliensThere is simply more stuff in Saints Row .  It is a much richer world with greater customization and variability.Anyone who came to the Saints Row series after GTA San Andreas will like Saints Row  the best as it is the spiritual successor of that type of game.  Saints Row  and  are not spiritual successors to Saints Row  and  so they may not share the same audience.Rockstar took a right turn after San Andreas and ended up at GTA.  Volition picked up where Rockstar dropped the ball but after SR they took a left turn and put the same characters into a different style of game.Everything that Johnny Gat says about the Saints trading their dicks for pussies is how I feel about Saints Row The Third.  I dont understand how they put that line in the game without realizing that Gat is basically describing Volition rather than the Saints.  I thought it was hilarious that they killed him off soon afterwards.,SaintsRow,cffpg2s,0,t5_2sjuw

1167875,0,t1_ci0r1mu,Guess what you need to use if you buy any game that had GameSpy servers bud? Buying a game and needing a free service that helps millions of people just because shitty servers go down isnt pirating. Oh and if you wanted to connect with friends and didnt have the money to own a server you DID have to use a program like those for Minecraft. Im not going to argue with you I just think the opinion that a PP program is for pirates is a really fucking stupid thing to say.,SaintsRow,ci10896,2,t5_2sjuw
