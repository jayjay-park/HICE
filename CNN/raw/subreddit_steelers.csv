353801,0,t1_cfh0fnx,You can say theres no need for WR but Id have to disagree with you just looking at the roster.Youve got AB locked up for another  years and thats great but look at the rest of your WR roster and tell me it isnt a need.  Of your three UFA WRs Cotchery Sanders Burress most likely  are gonewith Cotch being the most likely to be resigned. Hes a nice slot option but gets open more like hines ward with savvy route running not speed catch radius or high pointing the ball.That means Markus Wheaton is your number  and he hasnt really done a lot of wowing as far as Im concerned.  A promising but completely unproven commodity.  We ran with  WRs last year so that would leave us with Derrick Moye and Justin Brown getting serious reps next yearnot a proposition Im really excited about.This team does have a lot of needs and the DBs LB DL OL TE and RB could all arguably be addressed on the first two days of the draft as well.  But if Mike Evans falls to you at  you snatch him up.What Id love to see would be to trade down slightly later in the st round for someone chasing an overvalued QB and pick maybe an extra rd and th round pick while still able to get a good quality player in the first.  However with as many needs as this team has I would be very surprised at us trading down at all.Also as an aside the Steelers havent drafted for need in a long time.  Best player available regardless of need.  Chasing need is what gets you in trouble.edit Terrible sentence structure,steelers,cfhfsph,6,t5_2r526

716997,0,t3_22agep,It has to be James Harrisons pick just before halftime in SB XLIII.  The Steelers began the game well but Arizona rallied in the nd half.  I remember watching the game with my friends and witnessing the momentum begin to swing in the Cardinals favor.  When Ben was pickedoff deep in our zone I knew that they would score and take the momentum into the lockerroom.  My fears grew when the Cardinals made it to the yard line.  Warner hiked the ball and I saw receivers open in the endzone but seemingly out of nowhere Harrison appears and picks it off running it back for a TD.  The sense of relief and absolute joy that I felt as he took it all the way back is indescribable.  Instead of being one score down the Steelers went into the locker room with the momentum and leading by  scores.  If not for Harrisons pick the good guys probably wouldnt have won the game.  That play along with Santonios TDcatch make SB XLIII one of the most memorable for me.,steelers,cglrxya,1,t5_2r526

2482947,0,t3_2o0rh5,Wait since when has he been underperforming with his rag tag group of talent?  Ive been under the impression that theyve been performing about as expected given the circumstances.Its the offense that hasnt been playing at a consistent level.  Typically its either been an unstoppable juggernaut or a massive bedshitter.  Heck even the very first game of the season exemplified the offense this season in each half.  First half unstoppable scoring machine second half barely manages a FG to win.  And other than a fortunate  game stretch its been winlosswinlosswinloss...all season long.  And its not because of our defenseWe lose to the Bucs because of our defense?  Sure at ifrst glance you could blame them but you coudl also blame the offense for not being able to put them away.  All that was needed was a sustained drive.  We had the balls to go for it on th down against the ColtsRavens to put the game away but not against the lowly Bucs no we knowingly put the weakness of our team on the field to try and save the win.  Same story goes for the Jets.  Defense only gave up  points should have been no problem for a team averaging  points a game the  games prior.Then theres the RavensBrownsSaints losses and having to settle for FGs or flat out failing to score at all in the redzone.That being said I love LeBeau as well and even when he has had league leading talent hes been absolutely torched by some of the more modern offenses that other defenses have fared much better against Im not so confident hes the best choice going forward when we do start to mature some fresh defensive talent.,steelers,cminr9q,10,t5_2r526

Hes never been anything but a mediocre backup.,steelers,cn9lcyx,-2,t5_2r526
2692144,0,t3_2qvqgf,Well you have to take into factor that Ravens knew of a threat that Bell had even in the passing game. With him out when passing the Ravens can focus more on our WRs rather than Bell regardless of how many carries he may have. The passing game was working because many teams like the Ravens were paranoid of Bell getting that short pass from Big Ben so they had to cover him too. With him out like I said theyll focus more on the WR because I doubt any of our backups can fill his shoes. Maybe Dri Archer may come sort of close to a temporary replacement when Ben is looking for that short RB pass option but he wont change the offensive game like Bell would unless some miraculous talent comes out of Archer that we have never seen before.But the Ravens did know to stop the run and THUS made way for our passing to take hold of that game. But Im not sure how great it will be since the Ravens may have one less threat to cover when passing.Edit To add Without Bell we ultimately have little talent at the running game and we also take a hit to our passing to due to how pressured the opponents defense needs to be to watch out for that short pass to Bell. I like your thinking OP but I dont see in this case how it could help. These stats show the Ravens can stop the run but not the pass and without Bell we lack in the passing game too so there really isnt much upside without him sadly.Edit  I forgot about his pass block. Without him our pass block takes a serious hit too as seen when Dri Archer fucked up and Ben threw that pick. Bell does wonders for pass blocking.,steelers,cn9ze14,17,t5_2r526

2960925,0,t3_2u2dlm,Ive been hearing ranging comments on Steve McLendon from beast to bust. Is there any concensus to be reached with him? Personally I think hes the only reasoning behind NOT choosing a strd round NT in the upcoming draft. When looking at the OLB situation the only thing granted imo is that our pass rush will be better next year. We will have more sacks than the past season  with or without new rookie pass ruhers. Heyward will get better. So will Tuitt. Jarvis Jones was going to make an impact if it wasnt for the injury. Same probably goes for Shazier too. Worilds is almost the biggest question mark in terms of pass rush. If we somehow happen to decline in the sack stats Ill be looking Keith Butlers direction.About DBs... For many years now the Steelers have avoided choosing a CB in the top rounds. This should change this year. And if there truly isnt much CB value early on in this draft Im guessing we take a safety. Somethings not right with the way Shamarko has been kept on the sidelines. And is Mitchell really our best safety right now? Or Allen? Considering that Butler wants to go with hybrid defense eventually well need more box players linemen mostly who have the flexibility to play both  amp . However its probably too soon to forecast our draft picks based on this fact.My wishlist st Safety nd CB rd amp th CBDE th amp th NTTE th RB,steelers,co4o6nc,2,t5_2r526

3150418,0,t3_2w6270,Here is the thing there is no doubt we have more pressing needs on D. However need is a terrible talent evaluator and we should stick to the best available plan if we want long term success. Ideally we should use free agency to fill the immediate holes on D and the draft to build for the future.  So if there is a TE that we value highly at a particular position when we are drafting we should absolutely grab him.

However this is a talented CB class and we should pounce on the talent while we have the opportunity. Also it shouldnt matter what round we select an OLBEdge rusher. We need depth at the position and its hard to project on field success from any player taken in the draft. Its also been mentioned multiple times our D will not change dramatically.

3387728,0,t1_cpbtulp,Alright. Finally got my lazy ass to write this. Let me start off by saying  I said that our OLBs were solid basically saying that they will have an average year playing at least well enough to keep the front seven capable.Secondly I never said that the secondary was going to be a strength just that they would be good and not giving up as many big plays due to a more competent front seven.For the OLBs Outside Linebackers not Timmons Spence Williams or Shazier I feel that Jarvis Jones was going to have a good year and amass around  sacks while bringing somewhat consistent pressure and some streaky sacks. Going to the other side in Moats even if we pick up an EDGE in the draft he was a good backer for us in the  season. He had  sacks in games we won against CAR CIN and BAL creating splash plays any chance he could. I feel that LeBeau was losing some of his edge I hate saying it and stuck with his zone blitz scheme too much. The best thing Jones and Moats do is rush the passer and if it wasnt for Harrison coming back and Jones hurting his wrist I felt that the MoatsJones combo had a chance to get around  sacks together.Moving on to the horrendous secondary of . Im going to say it straight up. Are defense was horrible because of our loyalty to veterans Ike and Polamalu. They were both shells of their former selves and would constantly get burned or just didnt have the physical capability anymore to make good consistent plays. Mike Mitchell had a career high in tackles and apparently was playing injured with a groin injury. I think that Shamarko Thomas can step into a starters role again injuries and loyalty to vets limited his time and play well since he played his ass off in special teams making good tackles. If MitchellThomas can play healthy than the safety duo will be above average as they wont have to make up for failed assignments from Ike and Troy. William Gay was great  INTs for TDs and the Steelers got good play from the corners not named Ike or Cortez. Moving on to Cortez I feel that he is a capable starter if his mind is right good measurables and works his ass off as well. If the Steelers can draft the right players to start or for season depth at the EDGE or a CBS position I feel that the new change under Butler still probably  based could bring this defense anywhere from th what we finished total last year to th overall in the league.,steelers,cpeff7a,1,t5_2r526

At RB however when Bells out we havent got anywhere near as much. Williams is a decent backup but doesnt even come close.

Once salary cap issues rear their head that team will no longer be dominant.  years from some other young kid will be exciting on another team and people will underrate Wilson because he hasnt been to a sb in a few years.

Fuck that with both games left against Cincy were going for the division!This schedule looked like one of the toughest coming into the season but now looks much easier.Im in the minority but Id say sweep the Bengals. Just like last year. People are granted jokingly acting like its bad that we dont play them in prime time when Dalton sucks but our huge win over them last year when Bell went insane didnt come in a nationally broadcast game. The one that was nationally broadcast was much closer. Dalton has been playing out of his mind but he has to come back down to earth sooner or later.Yes Ben and no Scobee means beat the Ravens.Browns are the Browns sweep them. With Ben missing time I dont think we need the wake up call we needed that was last years loss to the Browns.I know theyre  but Denver doesnt scare me. The two things this defense does well are rush the passer and stop the run when Cam Thomas isnt in. Matches up well with where Peyton is at this point in his career. Their defense is scary but so is our offense with Ben.Indy sucks now...so theyre likely candidates to steal a win against us.Oakland can go either way. Theyre Oakland...but they look legit now.Seattle in Seattle late in the season after theyve had a disappointing start is intimidating. Steelers get a break by having their bye week but it may not be enough.So thats  to . I recognize that its homerism and super optimistic so Ill add splitting with the Bengals and a loss to Denver so  is the worst case scenario. But I dont see a loss to Cincy AND Oakland AND Indy AND Seattle. At most three of those.I do like Miami. Patience with Miller paid off for my fantasy team this week.

But I dont think they should. This should be implicit.gtWhen discussing Jacoby Jones returning punts for the Steelers its stupid to NOT consider how the Steelers view the situation.To begin with that is not what Im discussing. Im discussing whether or not Antonio Brown should be playing Kick Return. Secondly what Im arguing has nothing to do with how the Steelers view it. Because it doesnt matter how the Steelers view it odds dont work that way. Im saying I do not feel it is advantageous for Antonio Brown to be returning. Steelers view doesnt come into play. At all.gtAlso where did I ever say that the Steelers ignoring it changes the odds? Youre arguing something Ive never said.No you lack interpretation and through reading skills. You arent understanding and adding arbitrary factors into the discussion. You believe that because Steelers see it differently it makes my argument disingenuous and you resorted to calling it wrong.

5709789,0,t3_3tby0y,I think they sign him to a short  year deal and he makes the  man roster next year. We have a number of young developing CBs on the roster. Cockrell Grant just signed from practice squad and Golson all should contend for becoming consistent contributors and long term solutions at the positions. And then we have Gay and Boykin whose contracts expire at the end of this year. Coaching staff seems to love Gay and hes been playing well so I hope hes back. Boykin... I just dont know anymore. Will you offer a contract to a guy that doesnt get any playing time? The second half of the year should clarify the picture on him. I liked the guy in Philly and dont buy the tale that he can only play slot CB. All that to say it should be an interesting off season for that position group.,steelers,cx4usk7,7,t5_2r526

Make winning your division a playoff bid only seed based on record. Division games will still be important cause its still a guaranteed playoff spot teams will still strive to win theirs every year. But you eliminate the chance that a sub . team hosts a playoff game.

Its clear you dont understand either how the play clock works or how timeouts and the two minute warning works.If you take the TOs before the two minute warning they have to convert twice to end the game. Not once. Twice. You also continue to say it worked perfectly when we lost the game because time ran out and Ive showed you numerous times how they could have had more time on the clock. I give up.

6282497,0,t3_41mdx7,Steelers fans have this bizarre a fixation with the CB position despite it being one of the least valuable positions in the defense the Steelers run at this point probably second least only to NT.They almost primarily run zone with the corners playing off the receivers  yards with a focus being not on preventing catches and getting pass deflections although if they have the opportunity to do so theyre expected to try but on preventing big plays and limiting yards after the catch. Thats why comments like the Steelers need a shutdown CB are so funny to me by design the Steelers defense doesnt allow for shutdown corners to exist as in order for a CB to shutdown a receiver they need to be allowed to shadow them and play man to man coverage which the Steelers do not do. Unless a CB is absolutely ridiculously elite or completely terrible see Blake Antwon then there really isnt that much of a gap between an average CB and a great CB in the Steelers defense and its been that way for years.The gap between a st round CB and a rd round CB in this defensive scheme is a lot smaller than most Steelers fans think and as long as a corner has fluid hips solid instincts and is a decent tackler then they dont need to be  or an absurdly explosive athlete or possess elite cover skills because none of those matter as much as the aforementioned three main attributes.Flip side the front  is vitally important to the defense the Steelers run with a ton of emphasis placed on making plays and with the pass rush being the  key aspect that the Steelers defense is built around. By having their corners focus on preventing big plays and forcing long drives it allows the pass rush more opportunities to make impact plays either in the form of sacks fumbles or forcing early throws to flip field position and create better scoring opportunities for the offense. Thats why the Steelers always take linebackers and lineman in the st round because unlike the CB position whose job is to prevent big plays and force long drives the front s job is to create big plays and end drives and generally youre more likely to get a playmaker capable of doing that in the st round.,steelers,cz3qzis,13,t5_2r526

6286764,0,t3_41pxf9,Im a little confused how Jarvis Jones has a negative grade in run defense where he was actually pretty serviceable but a positive grade in pass rush where he was terrible and mustered just  sacks and  hurries in over  snaps.Steve McLendon was almost primarily used as a run stopper in the snaps he played and his grade in that area is rd best on the team yet he has a negative overall rating because he wasnt an amazing pass rusher. If the guy wasnt used much as a pass rusher and excelled at the thing he was used for on the majority of his snaps how can he have a negative overall grade?I kind of get Timmons and Duprees grades as Timmons was below average the first half of the year and Dupree was inconsistent but Shazier was pretty great in the games he played and even with a couple down games due to injury I have a hard time believing that overrides everything else he did.Cam Thomas should be rated much  lower than he is because he sucked literally every time he got on the field and against the Ravens he pretty much single handily handed them  rushing yards by himself due to getting blown off the line every snap he was on the field. Sean Spence should be rated higher and should certainly have a higher pass coverage grade as he was actually really good when starting or rotating in.On offense im a little confused how HeywardBey has such a low grade. I dont believe he had more than a single drop all year and he made a number of big plays in limited opportunities. He was also great as a blocker. Ditto Heath Miller who apparently did a terrible job of run blocking this season yeah im not sure how they got that either and was just a middling pass catcher. Also its kind of nitpicky considering everything else thats off here but why does DeAngelo Williams have a negative pass grade? He caught  balls and got a ton of yards after the catch yet apparently he was a below average pass catcher for his position.,steelers,cz48fv6,10,t5_2r526

7006131,0,t1_d1ae19f,That  sacks number is a mirage and in no way shape or form indicates a good pass rush. As I said when you sell out to blitz you put a ton of strain on the DBs and its a gross oversimplification to say that well its their fault because sack totals. This ignores the fact that when the blitz didnt get to the QB it made it almost impossible to prevent completions  and you could stick Revis and Sherman out there and itd still happen. Adding corners isnt going to magically make the pass rush any less anemic because the Steelers still utilize an off zone coverage scheme that will always allow for underneath catches regardless of who is at CB.But by all means continue to bang the table for the Steelers to draft a CB early and ignore that the team literally has two decent pass rushers. After all is it not Steelers fan tradition to allows blame the DBs?,steelers,d1ahn1q,1,t5_2r526

7225280,0,t1_d1zdeir,I would agree with the being mentored by a vet concept.  Each quarterback needs to find his own success with his own style.  Not to mention any mentoring should realistically be done by the coaching staff.  They should be able to recognize his weaknesses and play to his strengths. I wont agree with the idea that it hurts to sit a young quarterback for a year.  Not to mentor them but to allow them to learn the system with no real pressure.  Looking at that list you made most of those quarterbacks were busts or relegated to backup roles anyway.  I would attribute this to being thrown into difficult roles on some pretty terrible teams.Which leads me to my final point  I dont want Bens replacement to suffer those the same problems.  I want him to be successful longterm.  I want him to be an elite quarterback someday.  Starting immediately does not automatically transfer to being a great QB.  Its obviously too soon to tell if any of the guys on your list will be elite someday but when I look at the quarterbacks that we currently consider elite a majority of them sat at least a yeargiving them time to learn the system and a chance to be successful when they started.  Ben and Peyton being the only two elite QBs to start their first seasons and in Bens case he was originally supposed to be a back up that first season but started due to injuries.  The Steelers are too good of an organization to screw up like the Broncos did.  We should draft a QB with the intention of having him be the back up that first year.  The kid will know that going in that its Bens team today and it will be his team tomorrow so to speak.  Plus with Bens propensity to get hurt its almost a guarantee that the kid would get to start a few games that first year anyway.,steelers,d1zgl7y,1,t5_2r526

If everyones reaction to him causes him to fall to us in the second then all the better for me.

7758340,1,t1_d3o2527,same can be said for the Sharks. Depth is great on both teams.I will say the Sharks play more physical and more structured than any Eastern team. Thats a matter of conference. Eastern teams beside the Bruins and maybe Capitals have some strong players. Western teams play big from top line to bottom pairing.Penguins are going to need Malkin to be the number one scorer for sure. Crosbys going to go against Thornton a lot and while Crosby has been dominant on both sides of the ice this playoffs I definitely think Jumbo wins that match up. The two of them play very similar game and historically Jumbos come out on top by virtue of simply having  inches and like  pounds on Crosby. Im by no means knocking or doubting Sid there. Even when the Penguins have beaten San Jose Crosby himself hasnt had great games. I believe he had his worse there ever in .HBK is going to match up against Coutures line and no doubt Vlasic will take Kessel. Im not saying its an immediate lock but thats going to be the best resistance that the Penguins have seen especially against HBK.  Crosbys line will probably get the defensive pairing of Burns and Martin and thats certainly a threat. I see Malkin being the least protected there.,steelers,d3o2b7j,0,t5_2r526

8144239,0,t1_d4vk0pa,I think the greatest shame of Heaths eleven year career is that the only time he came close to his potential was eight games in . When he had a competent play caller a healthy QB and he was healthy too. He was on pace for what was then the third most TDs by a TE in a single season. Obviously since shattered by Gronk and Graham but still. In that ninth game is when Ben broke his collarbone. Then later in that season was when Heath tore his ACL and he was never the same since. Probably my favorite Steeler and the jersey I wear the most and one of the ones I wonder what if... the most for as well.The OL was bad and made worse by Arians play calling. Another improvement from early  was in those eight games Ben was only sacked  times. By far the best rate of his career with practically the same OL that Arians had. No excuse for Arians.I liked Mendenhall. Three straight seasons with over  total yards and  TDs is nothing to sniff at especially with the abysmal OL and even worse play calling. Overall a disappointment and you expect more from a first round pick but I wouldnt put the blame entirely on him. Always felt bad for how he always saw a defender in the hole had to spin out of the way and find somewhere else. And thats yet another thing I blamed Arians for. I could tell what play was going in which direction. I can only imagine what these defensive players who spend their lives and practically every waking moment of the past week studying and preparing for this would know.,steelers,d4vkqjy,3,t5_2r526

9319460,0,t1_d8x51vb,Its a combination of the two. Its not like Goodell himself doesnt help shape public opinion. Would the public perception be that Harrison is a dirty player if Goodell hadnt continuously fined him? Would the public believe Brady had done anything wrong if the NFL hadnt commissioned the Wells report?As for Spygate its way more than location of the camera and always has been. I know that people really milk the whole thats all the definitive evidence we have our hands on while ignoring the reports of destroying more damning tapes sneaking into locker rooms to steal playsheets but that doesnt mean theyre not there.The Bengals have been to the playoffs for six of the past seven years including the past five in a row. Burfict is a huge name if nothing else because of last years playoff game. And again the opponent matters. This was against the Patriots. He got into it with Gronkowski a household name who is on video game covers and in every other TV commercial. Im kind of with you in that I wouldnt  expect a suspension but itll have nothing to do with some unsubstantiated claim that the Bengals arent popular enough. Itll instead be because the NFL and Goodell have their priorities out of whack and are instead fining players for dancing or for wearing pink outside of October. Theyre big boys and can make their own decisions and theyre powerful enough to have a say in public opinion and storylines.

Id be hesitant to talk about equating headset issues with stealing signals and calls which even Goodell himself acknowledged isnt illegal and is still a normal occurance by the way because your own former super bowl winning coach admitted to doing the same as well as many others. gtim not concluding that the pats are cheating. Im saying the steelers should just be prepared to go without the headset entirelyThis I actually agree with except not for paranoid cheating reasons but because this stuff happens all over the league. They should be doing that regardless of who they play. Belichick has had his teams headsets go out countless times and he is always prepared for it. But lets be real the Pats arent cheating using headsets. The league already looked into it and cleared them of any wrong doing. This stuff is mostly run and monitored by the NFL. You think they wouldnt drop the hammer if the Pats were doing something shady with communications? ,steelers,dcl3v81,2,t5_2r526

10522474,0,t1_dcy6soc,Welp I guess I cant run away from this one so here it goes.  After last season I was convinced that we were only a couple defensive backs away from being a serious super bowl contender.  In the same episode that you are referring to I nailed the Artie Burns pick and said that we really needed another cornerdefensive back to go with him.  Enter Sean Davis.  In hind sight we should have probably also drafted an LB and cut losses with Jarvis Jones but I knew we had Harrison just in case Jones didnt improve which is exactly what happened.  That being said we had the luxury of having picks that we didnt really need at the time.  The O line is solid the D line is solid LBs are solid I thought the WRs were solid but I was disappointed with Sammy Coates this year.  I thought he was going to rival Bryants second year production which clearly didnt happen.  So when you have late round picks what do you do with them???   I am not backing down from the statement that I am not a fan of late round draft picks on skill players.  Yes AB was a late round pick but so are hundreds of guys that you and I will never hear of because they dont pan out.  My strategy would have been to either package the picks to move up or find an elite player at a nontraditional position draftwise.  Obviously guys like Justin Tucker can be the difference in a game.  Extremely accurate and has  in his leg.  Had we taken a kicker it would have likely been Roberto Aguayo who had a pretty rough rookie season.  But in college he made  FG of  in  years which is twice as many as Boswell hit in his  NFL seasons.I have definitely warmed up to Boswell this season but I am a little worried that his accuracy declined from  he was  last season vs.  this year.  Specifically he struggled with the long ball.  Bos didnt nail a single FG outside of  this season.  Last season he was a perfect .  His makes and attempts also declined from last year.  So despite having a solid season and being a playoff hero he attempted less FG that last year made less FG than last year had a lower conversion  than last year and lost a little leg over last year which is exactly what I was worried about since he had limited experience.  Now I do think hope that Boswell will improve next season.  Hes a loyal STEELER and I hope he stays in Black and Gold.  I also think Aguayo will shake his jitters.  Kicking is one of those positions where you are either good or you are not.  For example we have no way to truly gauge running backs because of the skill level of the o line.  Would Ezekiel Elliot be that good in Cleveland... probably not.  But a kicker is what he is.  The only thing that can help is kicking in a dome which Aguayo doesnt.  The talent is there he just got the heeby jeebys on the NFL stage.     So back to my point.  Matakevich backs up Timmons and Shazier.  Please let me know which one of those guys you want to sit down to get Tyler on the field.  Ill wait.  On the other hand Aguayo has the talent and potential to be a total game changer.,steelers,dd0u3y1,1,t5_2r526
10546915,0,t3_5r0r37,gtIn more than one game when he wasnt happy with how he was being used he frequently ran the wrong patterns either because of a lack of focus or  worse  intentionally.

He keeps the opposition honest spreads the field and often times an instant game changer. AB and Bell are both once an a generation type of talent and were lucky to have both on our team.So in my mind they are both irreplaceable parts  we shouldnt value one over the other. ALSO we dont have the problem of picking one over the other so we shouldnt. We should make the only right decision and sign both and have them both retire Steelers. ,steelers,ddlgyxt,1,t5_2r526

In four years only one return TD allowed in both kickoffs and punts combined. And coincidentally the game with the return TD Bens  TD game against the Ravens in  also featured one of the best plays Ive ever seen by the Steelers special teams a perfectly executed fire play when the extra point attempt was mishandled by the holder and resulted in a successful two point conversion. That was a testament to Smiths preparation and coaching.But his return units are always awful unless Brown is returning punts.

11766207,0,t1_dgtq0cv,Could be. Theyve been trying really hard to float the idea that they want a QB but are also willing to trade back. I think they have a small list of guys they want at . and if theyre not there they want to trade down and gain an extra top  pick.,steelers,dgtqaa6,1,t5_2r526

11801656,0,t3_68ctth,Im a big fan of Watt. I think he will work well as a OLB in the Steeler defense. A Ju Ju seems pretty good but USC receivers are hit or miss. Steelers dont miss often with WRs. B Cameron Sutton can play man they say. Guess we will see.  Im surprised they didnt take a corner in round two but maybe the best option was to get a better rd rounder than a picked over nd rounder?  BJames Conner has good power and complements Bell well. B Dobbs has well known accuracy problems and thats hard to fix with qbs.  Steelers need a specialized qb coach to come in and work with him and maybe he could be a starter after  years on the bench but its a stretch. B Im skipping the rest.  I havent read much about them yet and one is a long snapper. Yawn. Overall B Edit Bonus points for not taking anyone from Alabama once again those players make for extremely mediocre pros. ,steelers,dgxrbk7,2,t5_2r526
