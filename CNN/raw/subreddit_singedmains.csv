8276444,0,t3_4st4w6,I actually always take the Bandit mastery on Singed for a very similar reason to why you take coin.The main issue with starting coin though is that in order for it to be efficient you have to lose and you have to lose hard. It doesnt offer any early combat stats making trading much harder and the only time the item provides any value is for when you miss CS  wave will be worth about  minion mind youCoin in and of itself isnt awful on Singed but starting it just means you are forcing yourself into a hole you cannot get out of on your own. You mention how it works fine against match ups like cassio but at that point it doesnt matter what you start because you lose the lane regardless and cry for how behind you are.Pros It can generate gold when you cannot have the ability to farm and gives a slight amount of sustain.Cons You forfeit early dueling and force yourself into a losing situation even against people you are strong against.Overall its not terrible but I would still stick to corrupting or refillable  dark seal. These allow you to play a bit more aggressive proxy if need be and fight when needed.,singedmains,d5c44bc,3,t5_390hy

8444201,0,t3_4un1ws, I run tpignite. I consider ghostflash fall backs for poor map awareness even though you can use it aggressively. If you ghost not many can catch up I like being in tight spots  v  dealing as much damage as possible just out of their range. Ghost gives you a massive ms boost which is inefficent to some degree in my playstyle.  When you ghost most people just give up chasing I like when people chase me as long as possible. As long as you are just outside of their range they will think they can kill you. The fact that you have no summoner spell for escape makes you that much easier to be camped which means more pressure top if you have good map awareness. Having ignite makes it possible to deal with and kill chasing enemies.  With singed since youre creating so much pressure by simply shoving lane having the added bonus of a kill is invaluable imo. I have a particular build that runs around this. That arent many match ups that I wont get a kill. But this is just what im comfortable with.  An example of how i use it is after proxy first  waves if i tpor enemy stays in lane I can often get a kill if they decided to tank minion waves earlier and because I already have a golditem advantage in my inventory vq  hp enemey is usually a kill if played right. I also like to cycle between proxying and diving enemy without kill intent just chip at him  tower shot per dive gt regen gt proxy. Eventually if enemy ports base you just continue pushing if he doesnt rushing him with flingsky AA and ignite if he is low enough gives you kill or forces him to port back if you are too low to stop him.,singedmains,d5x2adn,1,t5_390hy

I look for what Im going to face in the inevitable teamfight. If thats Lissandra Braum Amumu etc  Mercs. If the threat is more AA based like a fed ADC Darius Fiora most Troforce builders then its Tabi. Keep in mind that an early boot rush can give you enough tankyness to get through lane phase and an early Rylais. Say Im facing Darius Ill probably build Ninja Tabi and giants belt letting me easily withstand his harass while farming up to get Rylais. The combination of Giants Belt and tier defensive boots is powerful defense in the early game and Ill use it any time Im not significantly ahead in lane. ,singedmains,d6ar5xq,1,t5_390hy

8857447,0,t3_51gg24,Heya gonna drop my  cents in on this one. For the longest time I have always really supported the idea of his passive being changed to incorporate his shield in a more direct way and to do this Ive got a few different ideas. Have his passive grant him damage reduction whilst his poison is turned on I mean for gods sake the shield is literally in front of him even if the reduction is only applied to damage sources coming from the front of him it would be great to see some sort of change that would possibly on a cool down cause his shield to actually be a shield. If Poppy can have a tiny shield that actually benefits her so can Singed. Alternatively a shield that generates as he runsuses poison just overall something to help the dude do what he do. Cause Singed to while having his poison active either ignore unit collision boring or place his shield ahead of him and shove minions and small summoned units aside whilst he runs much more interesting. This would solve the matter of Creep block as well as aid him in clearing a path back for teammates whilst retreatinga walkway to the enemies if engaging. More optimistically you could in theory force a creep delay by forcing your minions away from their traditional path causing them to rubberband and force the enemys wave to push. in Poro Roundup riot gave the Singed boss the passive of having his shield placed on his back. This blocked one blitz pull and this could really be practically worked into his kit I think. On a set CD while Singed is runningkiting he would be able to place his shield on his back and it would block a single instance of hard CC. This would help with his major weakness and would again give his shield more purpose than eye candy. Alternatively this could work for forward facing CC but the sentiment is all there.,singedmains,d7cjgbb,4,t5_390hy

10321250,0,t1_dcdwtz9,I would never legitimately build Mejais on Singed you really cant expect not to die on a champion who has to walk up to someone to do damage. If I wanted to build as a late game AP carry......literally thinking about this right now......Id probably go RoAgtTeargtSwiftiesgtRylaisgtLiandrysgtGunblade or GA.But if Im being perfectly honest I wouldnt ever do this in ranked. If you want to play for late game on Singed AP carry shouldnt really be the goal. Id get the RoA gt Tear then Id go pretty hard into tank. Once full build Id probably sell RoA for Liandrys. Late game focused tank Singed is scary youd have to be WAY ahead for late game AP Singed to be that same level of scary. Realistically if youre that far ahead you wont get to late game. Also building for late game is always a risk when you have strong alternative builds that focus on both early and mid game. Thats why most experienced Singed players dont touch RoA or Tear anymore. Most people will build for earlymid game damage RylaisgtLiandrys or mid game utility Righteous GlorygtZzRot.I dont think Ive ever lost with my only RoA build path. Usually I only make it to  RoAs before they surrender but Ive finished the build before. Again  troll build I do not endorse the legitimate use of this build.,singedmains,dcdyy31,3,t5_390hy

10886015,0,t1_de21q2m,gt DFT is the better mastery to go but it does not work in a tanky or split push Singed build. DFT needs you to buy damage for it to be usefulDFT scales insanely poorly with AP most of the damage out of it comes from its base damage. Also worth noting even with how strong CotC used to be every Singed picked in pro play was running DFT.Regarding CotC Lets be honest here it felt like a great keystone because it was almost on par with release warlords and Grasp in terms of how overpowered it was compared to other keystones. When champs like Riven and Darius are opting into it instead of TLD and fervor you know theres something wrong. ZzRot was an example of obnoxiously poor game design before its changes place anywhere for free pressure in a side lane stalling a tower in a lost lane makes for incredibly uninteractive gameplay. Current ZzRot at least better augments splitpush Singeds weak tower taking speed.,singedmains,de2tcjf,4,t5_390hy
10891698,0,t1_de2hnre,The Zz change is a nerf for it helping a tough lane. It makes you push now when you buy it. Before you could buy it to help you hold a struggling lane now you buy it if you want to push. It really hurt the early game versus champions that are a pain such as Kennen or Jayce. Now if you are against a tank you can basically murder towers like no other. But you lose its ability to make life easier.Feelsbadman,singedmains,de3eglv,1,t5_390hy

11575185,0,t1_dg7bui4,Chimpso is actually pretty decent at his Singed micro and I posted it as a joke to your comment about a crappy OCE Singed main. But I also posted a minishcap vid have fun calling him sht. As well as a build generator that has been pretty consistent from InvertedComposer it hardly ever suggests mana. And I posted the opinions of a lot of other Singed mains. So it is not just me that builds Liandrys to deal with Nasus easier.And HOTS has a lot more strategy than league. HOTS basically removed a laning phase from the game but put on more objectives that appear more often. There is a teamfight about every  min or less which you have to play and plan for carefully if you want to win. And on a more individual skill level knowing how to talent and what your role is on the team is important. There are levels where you would get absolutely no bonuses until you can use your abilities properly. So there is a lot of microplay as well as having a lot of strategy involved. League has a laning phase where people occasionally scuffle a midgame where there are a few more fights but it is still sort of calm then a late game where it is whoever wins the next fight wins the game. With objectives being exclusive to towers drag amp baron. Heroes of the Storm has towers siege camps boss and a different teamoriented objective for each map. As well as a lot of the characters can be more difficult. Such as Abathur a slug who never even goes directly into lane. Instead he is omnipresent and can be anywhere on the map there is an ally unit. So I have to manage helping my team across the entire map while splitpushing and keep track of myself so I do not instantly die from a character who goes stealth every  seconds amp I am responsible for vision a lot of the time So though league may have more of a focus on last hitting minions for strategy HOTS players have to plan out their entire talent tree and figure what objective is the the most important to fight over as a team.,singedmains,dg81xh2,1,t5_390hy
