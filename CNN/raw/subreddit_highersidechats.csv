854157,0,t3_23wb52,Funny you should mention that. Let me tell you something you wont here anywhere else! I have Jordan scheduled for an interview on Monday. Well see if it happens. Im not  confidant. Our communication has been very come and go. Im looking forward to it though. Hes promoting a kick starter to get The Jordan Maxwell Show off the ground. Hes trying to raise . Im curious to know if someone who is more tech savvy than Jordan is doing this on his behalf and screwing him over. You definitely dont need K to start a podcast. Anyway what would you like to hear him talk about?,highersidechats,ch1dfrl,1,t5_2zzeu

9964909,0,t1_db1mzh6,I think this one has potentially caught them a little off guard and they are being over zealous in how they react to it.. which in turn works against them in many ways.,highersidechats,db6gcbd,3,t5_2zzeu
10944417,0,t1_ddvqw4g,A little bit but one interview doesnt do enough to balance out all the problems I have with him and his approach. I still think he fills a role for controlled opposition but that JRE really did humanized him. I loved that episode overall and that he was down to party. I found him more likable than ever but thats not saying all that much. A skilled planted counterculture figurehead should be able to come off as likable when they want to. Just saying. ,highersidechats,de8u809,1,t5_2zzeu
