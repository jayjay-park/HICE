5763283,0,t3_3u2r1z,I appreciate this! Im a Christian but I wasnt raised in a tradition that prized memorizing snippets of scripture. I do think some Christians can go overboard memorizing scripture and turn it into a holierthanthou pissing content. But I need to recognize that theres real value in being able to bring some of these things to mind when needed. This would be a great bit to memorize but it has you thinking Okay God wheres my out? Show me how to get through this!,CardinalRegimentVI,cxbhlu9,1,t5_3aq4s
