4650859,0,t1_ctgej9e,I have no argument for that because it is true you could find the same factory and buy the same unbranded product yourself. If you can more power to you! However dealing with a manufacturer halfway across the globe and sending them money not knowing if you will even get the product is not worth the risk from my personal standpoint as a consumer. As I said this was not a marketing ploy and I did expect backlash from posting this but would you stand idly by as someone used your company name to sell inferior products? Sorry for any offense I may have caused. ,minisegway,ctgsw8t,-3,t5_38qfv
4668513,0,t1_ctiftjp,Well at first I didnt remove it it just fell out one side of the swegway doesnt have a cover for the pin so it just slid out from one side and fell off i could hear it clanking around I put it back in but it just kept falling off so i just removed it compeltely and now it works fine without it and no more noises.I think mine is a little different than yours judging by the pictures I can take a picture of how mine looks later today,minisegway,ctj0phg,1,t5_38qfv

5133460,0,t3_3l9g0f,Holy crap free shipping too? Tempting and I already have one... I wonder if theyre on fire sale now with all the pending litigation talk. Not as if China cares about making knockoffs but shipping them to the US may get harder.,minisegway,cv4rupz,1,t5_38qfv

5339980,0,t3_3nxwny,Thats the plastic shell but the wheel is a different story. The wheel and motor are one so either the axle is bent or the motor mount is partially broken. Thats NOT something a replacement of the housing will fix its either the axle or the frame.,minisegway,cvu8p4l,2,t5_38qfv

5485125,0,t3_3q78ci,Is it simply expanding or with force can you temporarily put it back in place? If so that is the case in mine. I just think that happens with wear and there is nothing you can really do. Granted the gap between mine still is very small but it does move sometimes.,minisegway,cwcrxno,2,t5_38qfv
5558148,0,t3_3r943n,Could be a hole in the wheel or could be a faulty knob or nipple. How long have you had it? They make a spray can called tire flat or something. You twist it onto the air cap it will shoot some white stuff inside the tire that should plug any holes. Not sure where you would go about getting a replacement tire for this thing though aside from teh supplier who will probably rape you on the price shipping is expensive and gotta wait a few weeks to get it. ,minisegway,cwm1f99,3,t5_38qfv

5796422,0,t3_3uke9a,Some of the standard model boards have a protection sensor where it slows down after you rotate  degrees we had a few of those too. Its not defective or anything just a safety measure some manufacturers added.However I am not sure what the problem is if you are describing a situation where your boards two motors seem to be rotating at different speeds when turning. Check the last few pages I think there was another poster with a similar problem.,minisegway,cxflmvr,1,t5_38qfv

Beware of the generic ones theyre shit and youll end up hating it once youve learned to ride it. Youll want a faster one almost immediately.,minisegway,czb9y9n,1,t5_38qfv
6390001,0,t1_cyynpw9,I have significant experience in all aspects of the industry. If you are still interested in morehonest and accurate information I would be glad to help. I have compiled a full industry report and market analysis that would surely cost you thousands to obtain elsewhere. Misinformation in comment above  per unit.You can buy  boards delivery from USA warehouses for less than  each with legit batteries.  unit order is very small as said above however it will not get bumped. Think about it factories can produce extra  units any day they want and will actually fill orders faster than large ones because they just add them on to large production runs. Price w DDP shippingall cost paid door to door air shipped will be less than  per unit Sea shipped ish. DO NOT PUT OUT BUYING REQUESTS ON ALIBABA YOU WILL GET s of emails most scams.  Sea ship  days ,minisegway,czfz6l9,1,t5_38qfv
