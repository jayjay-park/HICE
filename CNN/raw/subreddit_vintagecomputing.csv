The ferrous material on the surface of a floppy disk can be physically removed even just by wiping a finger over it. Older floppies will often see tiny flakes of the ferrous material as the binding agent fails it literally flakes off like paint but in teeny tiny flecks. Your best bet for cleaning a floppy disk is to use dry filtered compressed air from an air compressor  NOT from a can and definitely not from your mouth. You wont get all of the dust out but you can get much of it out.,vintagecomputing,czw0g2u,4,t5_2qn45

But once upon a time composers would make entire pieces via MIDI scores for sure.There are some fun games that will work on the box. Shufflepuck was one of my favorites if you can get a hold of it. I had a bunch of low end Macs in the mid s and we would string them together with AppleTalk which requires some connectors and regular old telephone cord to connect them together and wed play Bolo which is an overhead map tank game that is an absolute blast.
