8065419,0,t1_d4m7zy7,I ended up getting one last S with Hecarim mid today stomping a Zed god i love this matchup and its definitely a lot easier to get a good one with the same score.Actually i play a lot more normal games than ranked and i mostly play against diamond in normal with the occasional not lvl  yet fuck up from Dynamic Q when im Plat V in ranked. Thats why the screenshots are normal games aswell ,HecarimMains,d4mmo3p,1,t5_38tfr

10029843,0,t3_5javdw,Ghost is flat out better than flash on heca. The only situation where youd ever take flash is when they have a jarvan. Even then you can use your ult to get out of his ult. Meanwhile ghost synergizes well with E it lets you pull off dives and early ganks easier and gives you MS for your passive. Your ult while it is a great engage tool can serve as an escape in most situations if your E and ghost isnt enough. You can also pop ghost in close vs for a bit more dmg.,HecarimMains,dbewzq0,3,t5_38tfr

11277790,0,t3_60yk5s,If you get a crappy leash at blue  go blue wolves w on the raptors and run to red this will get your health up. Dont kill them just W take red with smite and level e then you can gank scuttle or raptors with your second smite. Or start red. Red wolves blue you should have just enough mana to pull off with a smite gankscuttle to regen mana a bit gromp gank back or raptors Krugs  sheen and control Ward.  this is really situational based off enemy jungler start,HecarimMains,dfabkh9,1,t5_38tfr
