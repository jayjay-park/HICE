1305253,0,t1_cigg07i,I suppose the Johnny WalkerTaco Bell comparison is very flawed. But I think you know what I mean. I would be delighted to sit down with a few good friends and polish off a bottle of either blue gold green or double black. But if I really wanted to drink a blended whisky that everyone loves Id have a Chivas or monkey shoulder. On the other hand its quite astounding how Laphroaig manages to perfectly balance all the elements earth turf wind of the sea breeze kind water of a beautiful soft spring and fire of the almost subtle smoky finish. It sounds so pretentious but its really true. You cant say that about any of the JW range. Theyre great crowd pleasers but they dont have the character that a lot of other whiskys do. Anyway go ahead and send some Taco Bells packets Il send you a sauce back too. I might hold a little hot sauce tasting session for a few people with those as the example of what passes for hot sauce in some places.,hotsauce,cigghhv,2,t5_2qmg9

6265732,0,t1_cz1j10k,ill be honest and say ive never fermented my hot sauces so i am not sure how it works in that sense. what i have learned however is that exposing the seeds to heat will make them release tannins after a period of time which make your whole batch bitter. i slice out my seeds and the white parts of the pepper and put them in a tea infuser and remove them after  min of cooking. i imagine you can leave them in the tea infuser in your mash while fermenting though again ive never done it myself so i think youll need to do some trial and error. please do report back in and let meus know. im fairly certain that the problem your having is the release of tannins from your seeds so youll just have to figure out when its happening. ,hotsauce,cz1ue6a,1,t5_2qmg9
