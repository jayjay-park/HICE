It may prevent the next kid from having this horrific first job experience. I would also go in for your next scheduled shift. You werent necessarily fired.  If you and your family need money badly you might as well continue making some as you look for a new job. ,mcdonaldsfreakout,d817q85,3,t5_33f0a
