7077711,0,t1_d1i6i69,Good questions! Lemme try to answer the best I can. Ill just trace the signal from JMRI to the BDL for starters. JMRI runs on a computer be it a laptop tower or Raspberry Pi. Connected to that via USB is the Digitrax PR. That translates commands into a format that Loconet Digitraxs network can understand. You also need a boostercommand station in there to provide power to the tracks and manage all of the commands and keep track of the locos and throttles and stuff so to kinda sketch it out youve got JMRIPC usbgt PR loconetgt BDL BoosterCommand Station ...Anything else Digitrax you add to your layout including DSs to control turnouts SEC to do signals and all that other fun stuff connects to Loconet. Each piece of gear that talks Loconet has two ports so you just daisychain them one to the next. When you start drawing out your layout in Panel Pro you get to choose which program you want to use. Theres actually two ways you can draw out your layout Panel Editor and Layout Editor and if you really want you can use both. Read about those HERE as they can explain the differences better than I can. When you define a section of track in either program you have the option of telling the program about a sensor associated with it. This makes it possible for the track to change color or for a light to come on or anything else you care to link to that event. You can keep trains from trying to run into an occupied block of track a couple of ways. The first would be to set up a series of signals and then use Dispatcher to run your train. It will observe and obey signals which you can set up to behave however youd like. The cool thing about this is that you can do your design in Layout Editor and then use the tools in there to set up much of the signaling logic right from the GUI. The more linear your layout the easier this task will be. Another option is to set up the Occupancy Block Tables and use Warrants to automatically run trains from there. This requires you to describe to JMRI every block of track what methods that block of track has to connect to other blocks of track and what those paths are to traverse that block of track. Its incredibly mindnumbing and repetitive but the upshot is that when youre done you can go into the Warrant Table and easily say Send Locomotive  from the Agricultural Siding Track  to Local Shipping Track  by way of Northern Pass Eastbound and it will make all of the connections obeying signals and local speed limits along the way. You dont even have to have signals set up it will hold the locomotive from entering a block that shows as being occupied. Another option would be to write a Jython script or set up some Logix conditionals though that might be hard without Transponding. It might even be hard with it... I dunno I havent used it   A lot of what is best depends on your layout and how you intend on using it. You can actually try it all out before buying anything right from within JMRI. You can create Internal Sensors that arent tied to any hardware and use those to build occupancy blocks. Start with a big oval or a long mainline and manually click the sensors activeinactive from the Tools gt Tables menu to see how things react. Its not the same but the more you can do in practice before committing to a plan the better off youll be. ,JMRI,d1img0x,2,t5_3d9a8
