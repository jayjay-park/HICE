6822596,0,t3_496b7d,Hi There!Id forgotten about the original simple. Its definitely a neat little machine that has stood the test of time. I can print these out for you but Im based in the US so shipping tends to sting a bit. ,reprapPIF,d0pn1rj,2,t5_2vvw4

I think the default is more or less heated presently and I grabbed one of the ED varipower beds. ,reprapPIF,d4f03i6,1,t5_2vvw4
11732735,0,t1_dgpl1q6,Your call! Its my first d printer so I dont really know the benefits of specific filament vendors.  for two sets of unusable parts is a little disheartening. Hopefully Ill be able to return them for a refund.,reprapPIF,dgpxozc,1,t5_2vvw4
11732786,0,t1_dgpxpo6,Doubt you can be greedy and the offer is always open I have  printers that dont get used as much as they use too...for filaments I prefer PETG for mechanical parts because its stronger and bit more wearvibration resistant. and because it doesnt expandcontract as much as ABS or PLA it ends up being very dimensionally stable.but as your getting into the d printing world you might want to take some time and read up on the differences in types of filaments as each offers different characteristics. no matter what hopefully youre able to get a refund sucks to pay for unusable parts because they werent made correctly.,reprapPIF,dgpxwgq,1,t5_2vvw4
