3611180,0,t3_31no36,Some things I disagree withMark says color pie breaking could destroy magic. This only seems true in terms of Standard and Modern. In eternal formats the relative power level weaknesses and color pie are so out of whack I fail to see a world where they print green creature removal or red enchantment removal that comes even close to rebalancing the game from blues favor.It also ignores the fact that those weaknesses were balanced under a couple of assumptions on how the game worked which are no longer accurate in some formats. For example reds weaknesses were balanced assuming a v format with each player at  life. In a multiplayer format with higher life totals reds previous strengths and weaknesses need to be reassessed to balance them effectively.,colorpie,cq3wg0o,2,t5_34h3u

5610847,0,t1_cvu5t80,Perfecting itself is way way too vague. Blues flavor is defined too vaguely. I think that is part of why Blue is overstuffed as OP points out.,colorpie,cwskvo4,1,t5_34h3u
