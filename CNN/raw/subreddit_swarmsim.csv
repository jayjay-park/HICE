2910307,0,t3_2tg5vd,I just love the new prestige system.  Its wise not to spend all your mutagens and change your buffs during your play in your way to your next reset  I start with meat units buff for faster growth and energy buff for faster nexus build and faster abilities. Once I get my abilities and have enough lepidoptera I will choose to amp my clone larvae limit. Once Im progressed enough in game I will collect meat and territory but not upgrade my larvae production and then when I have about  or so upgrades I will respec my mutagen and buy mutagen buffs. So I will drain those upgrades at max and then rest ,swarmsim,cnywqwr,1,t5_339kw

3224790,0,t3_2x2a1x,Another thing to keep in mind about this game is that the pace is MUCH slower. Each ascension will generally take around a week so dont think youre playing wrong when youre not ready to ascend after a few days. You will however have plenty to do in that week.. Its advised to browse this subreddit for tips on optimizing your playtime particularly the clone larvae strategy for your first playthrough,swarmsim,cow94iv,3,t5_339kw
3249887,0,t1_coygwh9,no i dont have any math in that regard sorry...but hatcheriy mutation is also just a linear bonus....it stacks with the swarmwarp of course...all the mentioned mutation are pretty good it is your decision in the end.be aware that the meat mutation is not a flat bonus to everything it boosts the higher ranks less than the lower ones otherwise this would be incredibleim pretty sure meat beats out hatcheries as it gives you a bonus even before the hatchery larva become relevant again,swarmsim,coyuxuf,1,t5_339kw

3365737,0,t3_2yq2pf,rd mutagen  m may take a while. export a save and keep it somewhere. Ascend now.

3548211,0,t3_30xibz,As far as I know if you have enough units to buy multiple upgrades but little enough that buying the last upgrade too would cripple your production you are supposed to be seeing a button that buys all but the last available upgrade. Thats what the third button that you are seeing does for upgrades.Although I do admit getting that one for territory units would be really nice.,swarmsim,cpwpvvf,2,t5_339kw
3567893,0,t1_cpyqgdk,Why .?  I remember concluding in our previous discussion about this that the ratio between the cloning limit and the ideal amount of larvae to rush to before cloning will always be a power of two.   rushes would be the ideal number in the majority of cases.,swarmsim,cpyytbl,1,t5_339kw
3584181,0,t3_31e7ni,I have similar numbers to yours usually I drop . into each of the mutations which is useless for most it just doesnt matter much then distribute a total of  into meat bat clone warp and rush usually the first  a little more than the latter  but again the differences are insignificant.Then before ascending I dump everything to Meta and buy hatcheries. ,swarmsim,cq0tpq1,2,t5_339kw

6707743,0,t3_478dle,I liked to do  larva rushes then clone until the ascension cost was about k then warp til it was about k then ascend.  If you have the same mutagen in all the upgrades where there is no cap then a clone gives vastly more larva than a warp so at least a few clones means your warps start with a much higher top unit count at least  OoMs more.Since I was warping until a warp gave far less than an OoM of meat I felt this was better but it was all intuition I didnt do any maths.,swarmsim,d0d4zaw,1,t5_339kw

7634544,0,t3_4jqzoe,Swarm warp later on combines with everything. See the meat hatchery and territory mutation you have? If you warp you also get those benefits. But if you clone or larva rush you dont.Bats also increase it massively. Also a bit later the game is basicly limited only by energy because you want to get mutagen fast which happens fastest when you can warp the whole swarm. With swarm warp you get the production of months in  minutes. All for those hatchery upgrades because those give mutagen and that mutagen is way more larva production then you could get thru rush or clone.,swarmsim,d3a07nl,1,t5_339kw
