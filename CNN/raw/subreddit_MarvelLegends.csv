9935365,0,t3_5hbts9,Boom! Stopped by TRU this morning and found the entire wave in stock all but Shocker. Found Green Goblin and Ms. Marvel purposefully hidden behind the  figures though. Almost walked out empty handed but then thought Id double check in case some kid hid them. Only wanted Goblin though put Ms. Marvel back on the peg tempted to go back and scour for Shocker lol.,MarvelLegends,db2lqhr,1,t5_3851f
