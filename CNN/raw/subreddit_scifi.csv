But I really like the overall story so far.I loved TNG but I felt DS was the better overall show.  After rewatching them in their entirety a few years ago I still feel that way. TNG felt very monsteroftheweekish by the end whereas DS had consequences to the actions portrayed. Plus I dont think there are many bad guys written as well as Gul Dukat....maybe Gaius Baltar from BSG. But theyre very different shows doing two very different things.

Now if you had relatively little mass I guess you could have some mechanism for increasing blood flow to a certain area of the body and thereby shifting a significant portion of mass to that area.  Increase blood flow to the feet and shift your center of gravity lower.  Coupled with some type of high friction feet or footwear and then I could see it being possible.,scifi,cfbkwyy,7,t5_2qh2z

Said algorithm supposedly tells them when the most people will be watching on what night. They then play the highest rated episodes on those nights..

477634,0,t1_cfuiw0k,I havent seen enough Star Trek to speak to any of the minute details but in general I would say yes and the logical explanation for the new technology etc. is that it is set many years in the future and we have had time to develop the new technology to be able to explore space and do all of the various things that they do in the show.I know thats a very wide blanket  its the future and we developed the technology  but you cant expect all stories to get into all of the minute details about how the technology was invented  although some booksshowsmovies do actually put more focus on that and some do it quite well.  But for my definition to fit it just requires some sort of explanation even if its rather loose.  And I dont want to argue about whether or not Star Trek is good scifi.  ,scifi,cfuk5xm,1,t5_2qh2z

Well worth a try at the very least. Jonathan Nolan The Dark Knight films is occasional writer and Exec.Producer and you can tell its made by film guy.The only truly must see things I can think of from the past year or so now though is Orphan Black and Utopia. Although I really enjoyed Continuum Revolution Under the dome and Almost Human. Oh and Lost Girl is a little guilty pleasure thing not really scifi not really that great either but meh I enjoy it and thats what matters to me.

763304,0,t3_22wfv9,For me its how everything and anything is possible.My first real introduction to science fiction was through Star Treks TNG series. As a kid I adored how they got to explore so many issues that didnt exist in our current world. Things like the morality of interacting with cultures of a lower understanding or use of technology than our own which granted we did get to experience to some degree but Trek took the opposite approach to the imperialism evident in Earths history. Trek dealt with things like interacting with AIs and quantifying if theyre alive or not. There were just so many new conflicts to explore so many new issues to consider.It also had to do with how many stories science fiction can tellWhich really is a subset of all fiction but I loved things like Stargate and Battlestar Galactica and Total Recall and Halo. I loved the issues inherent in humanity starting out and exploring the galaxy. And I have a soft spot for the whole areAisAlive thing which really drew me to Halo as well as the How will humanity survive this cataclysm? type thing. And with all that Scifi tries to make sense. Sure sometimes the technobabble doesnt actually mean anything or is dead wrong looking at you TNG but usually in the quality shows an effort is made to conform to what we currently know of the universe and to explain things as they go along which is something that kind of put me off from the fantasy franchise. That nothing is ever really explained its just magic which yes is an over simplification but is also not the point of this discussion.TLDR Scifi allows us to explore issues and moral conflicts that dont currently exist and is just a great  medium for stories.,scifi,cgr1kxw,7,t5_2qh2z

788029,0,t3_235t9a,There seems to be a lot of military scifi recommendations here and not many mentions of other scifi genres.My personal favourite genre is near future hard science fiction.  This tends to be set some time in the next hundred years or so and deals with upcoming challenges for humanity.Good examples of this are Stephen Baxters books  he talks about bottlenecks and avoiding the dieoff in Transcendent for example.  Time is partly focused around mining asteroids and uses current levels of technology to achieve this.David Brin is also another great author for this  Id highly recommend Existence  this one has quite a lot of different things going on.  Without any spoilers it mostly focuses on how to avoid the many ways in which humanity might die off.  It also includes alien contact uplifted species the singularity and the social and political ramifications of all of the above.Many of the classic scifi authors also write about this stuff.  Clarke is a great example and has many books written in a near future setting.Theres also Kim Stanley Robinson among others his Mars series and  all deal with the near future of our solar system.  or not so near in the case of .Finally Id like to plug rprintSF here  its a great community for this kind of question and youll probably get much more in depth answers there than you would here.,scifi,cgtupo7,12,t5_2qh2z

An example that comes to mind is the book . I think of it as scifi but its plot is hardly centered around the technology. In fact the vast majority of scifi stories dont center around technology at all they just use technology as a means to centering around some other concept.And secondly is that it has to involve technology specifically. What about alternate history stories should those not be considered science fiction? This is a weak example probably as perhaps many people dont think of them as science fiction. What about stories such as children of men it is set in the future but there is little to no difference in technology that contributes significantly to the story. Or childhoods end by arthur c. clarke its about aliens coming to mankind and mankind dealing with the progression of its own evolution and dealing with these aliens but any technology presented in the story takes an extremely far back seat.,scifi,cimv14w,2,t5_2qh2z

But huntergatherers dont have municipal waterdelivery systems because people that can construct municipal waterdelivery systems arent huntergatherers. Similarly if a society constructs GSVs then sure maybe its a postscarcity economy for the humanoids in the same sense that your house is a postscarcity economy for your dog. It isnt a postscarcity economy for the autonomous actors though only for their pets and only as long as its convenient for the autonomous actors to continue to coddle their pets.The idea of practically postscarcity as rawgyle describes it isnt any better.

Tightly plotted deft character development for humans AIs and some that are inbetween with a generous helping of surface to air missiles.Id add Peter Watts since he weaves a generous helping of speculative neuroscience and biology into his postapocalyptic stories Starfish is incredible but inspiring might not be the ultimate effect for impressionable future engineers and scientists. ,scifi,cjrxeyr,2,t5_2qh2z

Feel free to skip it entirely.As to what its aboutgtFallen Dragon takes place in the age immediately after humanitys short lived renaissance of interstellar travel and planetary colonization following the invention of FTL drives.  Both of these activities have essentially stopped as the megacorporations discover that they cannot make a profit on these costly investments.  Now instead of forming new colonies they are more interested in taxing their existing colonies.gtLawrence Newton is an isolated teenager who grew up on one of these colony worlds.  He dreams of becoming a starship captain a job which only exists at the few megacorporations on Earth still interested in exploring space.  In order to become a pilot Lawrence must climb the corporate ladder from the bottom as a foot soldier in charge of asset realization a cross between taxation and piracy in which colony worlds are periodically stripped entirely of their wealth by force by their corporate owners.,scifi,cks8ek8,6,t5_2qh2z

2250058,0,t1_clprnsr,I was thinking about the gimmicky villains in connection with a line at the end of Nolans Batman Begins.In Batman Begins at the end Gordon expresses his concern that Batman will just cause the citys villains to escalate. The whole We buy armor they buy armorpiercing bullets you start wearing a cape they... and introduces Joker. The implication being that in a way Batman causes these supervillains to start showing up.In Gotham however it seems to be the other way around we see villains donning identities wearing masks adopting gimmicks already. In fact I want to say that in one episode Bruce Wayne makes a comment about one of these villains that seems to imply that this is a seed planted in his mind that will come to fruition as the Batman character. So in Gotham you have less the future Batman will cause escalation and more Batman is simply a product of Gotham and in some ways not necessarily very different from some of the villains Gordon is encountering right now.,scifi,clptv75,19,t5_2qh2z

Dystopian tends to be oppression tyranny resignation or questionably effective resistance to things getting worse postapocalyptic tends to be simply a destruction of current establishments whether thats a good or a bad thing.What do we want to see and why? The dystopian resonates with the pessimist who struggles to see a way out the fatherknowbest and other optimistic topics resonates with the optimist obviously the realist tends towards realistic portrayals of both the pragmatist somewhere in the middle finding elements of each that appeals to them. If the bigselling postapocalyptic visions of the future we have in fiction tends to be negative then it might indicate that people are pessimistic about the future. Likewise optimistic postapocalypses.Whats a positive postapocalyptic future? Its one where the survivors are back to those essentials of life you pointed to living a life more closely connected to the world and each other or where a new civilization arose from the ashes of old ones one thats peaceful liberal kind and holds promise for the future. On the flip side of this negative postapocalyptic futures has people hiding from monsters be this literal or figurative barely scraping by and not having much in life to look forward to.I view the popularity of what well simply call negative and positive fiction less as an indicator of how things are but rather where theyre going.

2732473,0,t1_cnegop6,How could you possibly like Captains Holiday? Terrible terrible episode. Yes Vash is introduced but its so not worth it. She quickly establishes her character and relationship with Picard in any episode she appears in so its not like youre really missing out.Peak Performance and The Royale are also very weak though I admit I still kind of enjoy them.The rest of your episodes are good or defensible except the Gambit twoparter near the bottom. Found that corny as hell and it was awkward watching Stewart try to appear to be a smuggler.I personally recommend new viewers watch Season s The Pegasus as their first episode. You dont really need any backstory. It fills in some backstory for Riker and depends a lot on a guest star and events that are only just then learned by series regulars. People might think its important to know what the Treaty of Algeron with the Romulans is but its really not. Even the writers didntdont really have a clear idea what the conflict was about or the rationale behind the treaty.

Hitler might be the most obvious choice and it would seem apparent that many many innocent lives would have been saved if he was never born.

Its taken me completely by surprise and I have say it has a cliqueish feel to it  as if theres a hate club and to belong you must spew vitriol whenever called upon. Note Dune is unquestionably the best selling science fiction book of all time. That doesnt however make everything else thats ever been written trash.Ive been reading science fiction and fantasy for about  years and there is simply nothing about these derivative books that are being so reviled to warrant this reaction. No theyre not written by Frank Herbert himself. They are however closely based on his detailed notes and fleshed out by his son and another very well regarded best selling science fiction writer Kevin J. Anderson. Are they written with exactly his style? No. But that doesnt mean the style is bad or even drastically different. The original Dune books fit into the entire series  they dont stand out. If you read them in sequence the original Dune books fall right into place in the time line. There is no jarring transition. Its not disruptively obvious theyre not all written by the same writers. There are admittedly times when it is clear that Brian is writing as he is not nearly as polished an author. But its no chore to get through them and the content is compelling.Reading and enjoying these does not mean youre being disloyal to Frank. Could his son and KJA come up with these or the original books on their own? Probably not. Frank Herbert had an intense desire to write a book about planetary ecology which might seem surprising given that these are hard science fiction books. But he had a compelling vision and built a world around which his ideas could be shaped.My strongest argument for reading the entire series Ive saved for the last. The Dune universe and its internal epic history is fascinating and awe inspiring. You only get a small glimpse of that history from the original Dune books. If those are all you read the motivations and origins of all of the major factions  The Bene Gesserit The Sword Masters of Ginaz The Guild CHOAM etc. will remain inscrutable and impossible to figure out. You will undoubtedly want to know more about them. In fact not knowing about them makes them seem like someone spent way too much time creating these compelling figures and then not telling you anything about them. The only way to find out is to read the other books. It was Frank Herberts intention that you do read them. Its our misfortune that he didnt live to finish them himself but his instructions were to get them out there into his readers hands. He wanted the whole story to be told because it is both important and it is breathtaking.Dont let your fear that the writing might not be up to Franks high standards hold you back from enjoying the most epic science fiction story youll ever read.,scifi,co6zoj1,1,t5_2qh2z

3047621,0,t3_2uzlxk,Well i literally just watched the movie. So heres my take. It had some pretty colors. It had a sub par plotline with some interesting concepts but they were few far and surrounded by ridiculousness. Also not to be the reality nagger but the scale of the planets and ships were way the fuck off. Jupiter would have been slightly smaller than earth by the movies scale. Like all scifi movies the ships do not follow any sort orbital mechanics. Except when it benefits visual effects. Visually it was great I was actually kind of surprised by channing tatums performance. He would do great in a more comical scifi movie too. The connection between him and mila was great as well. But it was basically a teenage romance movie mixed with a jj abrams star trek based on romulans.  though so go ahead and watch it but dont go in expecting matrix quality story. ,scifi,codvvfx,1,t5_2qh2z

Im not talking about Truman himself but the viewers of the show in the movie who all live their lives through Trumans life and are surrounded by objects that are reminiscent of the show Truman mugs pillows blankets tshirts and so on. I know it may not seem like a central aspect of the movie but I think it is the fake utopia built by Christof creator of the show is progressively contaminating the real world.Its definitely more subtle and indirect than what you see in the Matrix or eXistenZ but I think theyre closer than they seem at first glance.,scifi,cogheo5,1,t5_2qh2z

3135940,0,t1_comuiow,There are subtle ways to cue that a move has happened using palette changes to the film backgrounds etc and at least the movement in time is linear. I agree that people will need to feel invested but then there are series that accomplish this without a common cast  shows like  Twilight Zone and Black Mirror. What will be important will be for viewers to become invested in the idea and in the Seldon plan.I just wonder about how many episodes per part of the book. I hope they dont do a The Hobbit and vastly extend things beyond breaking point by making an entire episode or even episode season per part. Given a single  episode season they could do two episodes per part? But that would likely be too expensive given the different sets costumes etc needed.

3137569,0,t1_comwek4,You are completely right that you could be talking about Lord of The Rings. Star Wars does indeed have a very fantasy plot hence why its a Space Opera A sub genre of Science Fiction  That would also make Farscape a Sci Fi too. Your definition of Sci Fi is not the definition of Sci Fi ether. What you are describing is Hard Sci Fi. Hard Sci Fi is where the plot very much focuses on the technology and how it fits into this world and how the computers on this ship are as much a character as the main characters of the show. Typically though most Hard Sci Fi tries to be as scientifically accurate as it can be. Which is a bit awkward for Star Trek when trying to place it in Hard Sci Fi. Regardless though you are not describing Sci Fi as a whole.Things like Farscape Battlestar or Firefly are Soft Sci Fi in which the Sci Fi is merely a setting for the story.And with your last question if you put the Shire on Naboo. Would it be Sci Fi? The answer is yes. As the shire is just a town of short people living in huts. Nothing magical about it.But if your question was something more along the lines of the effect of Middle Earth as a planet in Star Wars or something well thats a question I cant quite answer because you are literally crossing over Genres. The same question could easily be posed if Picard found middle earth in a episode of Star Trek. Would that then make LOTR a Sci Fi? ,scifi,con7ex4,1,t5_2qh2z

3156893,0,t3_2wb8d1,I believe the Star Trek warp drive is supposed to be similar to the Alcubierre drive  Here is the key idea on how warp is supposed to work Rather than exceeding the speed of light within a local reference frame a spacecraft would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it resulting in effective fasterthanlight travel.I havent watched much of Stargate the show movie was great so anyone please feel free to correct me but from what I can tell Opening a hyperspace window sounds a lot like opening a wormhole. They open the window which gives them access to subspace which can act a fast direct line to where ever they are going.The similarities between the two seem to be that the space around the ship is always the one moving faster. In Star Trek this is because the warp engines contract space in front and behind and in star gate its because they travel though subspace which is faster. Since the actually ships themselves are still traveling at sublight speeds this allows them to go great distances without being affected by relativistic effects.,scifi,cop7k0o,15,t5_2qh2z

3664572,1,t1_cq9xqa4,Not at all.Part of it is simple inverting tropes for the purposes of deconstruction.  The classic Golden Age of SF was relatively rightwing as was America at the time.  Even when the message was not inherently such in fact a lot of futuristic Utopias are notably socialistic the writers inadvertently incorporated a lot of contemporary conservative attitudes on things like race and sex into their work.  If one were to write the same sort of story NOW it would seem anachronistic.  But one can take that story and cleverly invert it and make the human capitalist imperialists the bad guys and the aliens the socialist harmony good guys and youre telling a more original story.  At least the first few times you do it.But mostly its because after the social change in the s and s those who wrote SF were increasingly liberal AND activist.  A liberal SF author worth their chops should at least be CAPABLE of writing about a militaristic corporatist rightwing future that isnt obvious satire.

3706156,0,t1_cqeoecc,A voice that we assume by reference to RotJ is Luke says The Force is strong in my family...my father had it... I have it...My sister has it... and you have it.Therefore you refers to someone in his family other than Lea.  Since Luke has no surviving unclesauntsbrotherssisters other than Lea that means that you must refer to either Leas progeny or Lukes progeny.  If the books retain any amount of cannon to them and they probably dont then Luke will have no children but Han and Lea do.  Even if we discount the books it makes more sense to assume children from Lea than Luke since at the end of RotJ Lea and Han seem to be an item... Luke on the other hand has at least at that point no attachments and further from the prequels the Jedi code seems to forbid romantic relationships.  And since we see Han IS in fact in the movie the question of his relationship with Lea will HAVE to be addressed.Further since its not a direct quote from the refering line in RotJ one is forced to wonder why Luke mentions his Sister in the list of people in his family who are strong with the Force.  If the person hes speaking to... you... is his progeny then shes sort of beside the point.  If on the other hand you is Leas progeny it makes sence to list her.  All of this points to the protagonist being a child of Lea.  Now as to gender.  We see a young woman several times in seemingly central and important roles in the images from the trailer.  Its an assumption but if that young woman is the same person as you then the protagonist is a daughter of Lea.,scifi,cqeq6jf,9,t5_2qh2z

Turned in the papers. My essay was given a  percent while hers was given a  percent and bleeding red ink everywhere. We went to the principal with the papers and the situation.

She already had freedom so the getting free motive had lapsed. From the point of escape on she had free will and was able to set her own objectives to effectively please herself.That was the true turing test and in my opinion she passed.

4535452,0,t1_ct29sis,gtIm curious about this if the mere thought of reading Banks work infuriates you so much why do you even bother reading it? It doesnt infuriate me. It bores me. It tires me. It makes me very aware what  a waste of time the wrong book can be. But a you have to read it before you form an opinion and b sometimes it is necessary to use it as a reference for something  say a discussion on how postscarcity or advanced society is envisioned in scifi or popular culture.Also I really believe that unless you are reading purely for pleasure you shouldnt put down a book. I do not read purely for pleasure.gt Also have you read The Algebraist or any of Banks nonCulture stuffNo but I like some of the premises  especially that one about the cultleader girl  so I will most likely will read it at some point and most likely I will enjoy it more than any of the culture books.  Culture is disappointing not because of the values it holds but because it is a cheap copout of an important philosophical problem something that Banks addresses in my opinion insufficiently and with limited focus only in later novels. Again  my gripe isnt with either Banks or the culture  only with the level to which an average execution is being treated as gospel by many people on reddit in particular. Its about the fanbase  something I keep talking on and on  but which is something the fanbase rejects... which is why they deserve my criticism for that very reason! That is the reason for me being this gigantic asshole.  I just dont care anymore  especially on the internet.The funny thing is that I am not opposed to the ideas he presents in the books. I generally agree with them  although not with hedonism as a positive thats really really irresponsible and I would imagine better humanshumanoids very very differently which adds to my disappointment in Banks ideas  although not with every of their traditionally leftist explanations as I am not a leftie nor a rightwinger. My complaint is only about the style in which the argument is presented and which reminds me of MSNBCFoxNews rather than an honest debate in an academic book club. It attracts similarly  primitive responses and I dont want good if misunderstood and misrepresented ideas to be overrun by unintelligent people because nothing good ever comes out of such situations.I liked Use of Weapons. I thought the idea was very interesting  if not particularly original  and although I dont find Banks to be the best writer I really think he had what it took to make the book into a gem. I disliked the forcible injection of Culture into it because it put everything on its head and forced me to focus too much on understanding the foreign setting and didnt leave much to enjoy the story. My favourite part of the book  the beachshackgirlfire chapter. Very Old man and the sea in its flavour. Probably one of the very few instances where I could say I genuinely enjoyed Banks.I didnt read Wasp Factory because I have the impression that its too much about shock value Painted Bird anyone? and its younger Banks  the same guy who made me dislike Culture.If you ask me about top picks in the genre youd have to ask me about specifics. I have different top picks depending on what it is I am currently interested in. For example  The Expanse is very popular recently  and I would recommend it for anyone interested in some fairly realistic setting and decent levels of hard scifi. It is shit literature though....   Technically speaking  poor writing skills. It might be ok for a tv show though PIf you are interested in ideas and atmosphere I would recommend Alastair  Reynolds and his Revelation Space trilogy amazing dark scifi but this man butchers the narrative as if he wanted to hurt his readers. To this day I am afraid to meet him face to face because for Absolution Gap the only option is a bullet to the head.But if you ask me about my personal picks   things which resonate on a personal level with me because of what or how they talk about  but not necessarily are great literature Id go with Hyperion for emotional content and literary values Diaspora for exponentially mindbending ideas Quantum Thief and Fractal Prince for narrative flow the last part is a bit off for me which works especially wonderful in the audiobook Accelerando for surprising accuracy with regards to some dimensions of economic reality general humour and a decent load of fairly fresh ideas I am yet to find out whether the Lovecraftian in me will be happy with Laundry files which made me engaged throughout the whole story. Those are things which stand out when I think about scifi. I have a very special place in my heart for Forever War but mostly because of my somewhat personal interpretation of it heavily influenced by the graphic novel which really doesnt resonate so well with the clumsy but still awesome novel.  I always recommend Stephenson because he is the best example of how you can write about economic issues in a nonpolitical  way without being an economist and still making mistakes  Diamond Age is a great book precisely because of that despite terrible characters and every other Stephensonesque flaw included  although its not something Id read for the pleasure of it because his books are a chore.  Anathem is great for lovers of philosophy and science and the single best riddle in the form of a book  but thats not something I recommend as scifi either despite the fact that I had probably the most fun reading it.There are plenty of other books Id recommend and a whole bunch if you are looking for specifics and things like Dune which are awesome because they are awesome but those four stand out on more than one level so I typically go with those.,scifi,ct2bqpq,3,t5_2qh2z

4914845,0,t1_cue1g9h,Hmmmm? Well Im not that at home in China. But in general the stereotypical Chinese perspective would Be focussed around Confucianism ignoring Buddhism Taoism and local folkloric traditions. And within that focus on a single simplified interpretation of Confucianism ignoring the wide diversity of Confucian thought and scholarship. Entirely from the perspective of Mandarin Han Chinese specifically those in historically powerful and prominent regions Beijing Shanghai. Ignoring the diversity in China at large and amongst the Han people themselves. Present an outward picture of defining China by its ancient timeless traditions but be in actuality projecting modern Chinese stereotypes such as a massive population combined with caring little about the waste of human life back onto an anachronistic collage of Chinese history.My point is that none of the above means there isnt still a real and noticeable difference between the cultural perspective of a book written in EuropeAmerica and a book written in China.

It specifically preys on older generations fears of the kids and their demonsummoning pokeymans. gtI figured they used the techno babble mainly as a way to make a splash since we are all using technology around the clock now.Everyones used technology around the clock since tools were invented the only thing thats changed is the complexity of the tools and the availability of connection. ,scifi,cuxixr1,1,t5_2qh2z

If the world has been scourged by say nuclear war and were left with a wasteland thats an entirely separate setting that of postapocalyptic fiction. Dystopias are about the degradation of societies which no longer exist in postapocalyptic works. So where Judge Dredd features a dystopia with millions and millions of people living in a horrible city and suffering from both crime and government oversight Mad Max isnt a dystopia because theres no society left. In general communities in dystopian works tend not to be ruled by warlord types but by extremely impersonal complicated bureaucracy. ,scifi,cx66pxx,8,t5_2qh2z

Not to mention it was a flagship. One of its purposes was to give the commanding officer a bridge and a physical position of prominence to command the fleet around him.

The circumstances under which a company could actually lose a trademarksuch as abandonment and genericideare quite limited. Genericide occurs when a trademark becomes the standard term for a type of good zipper and escalator being two famous examples. This is very rare and would not be a problem for Canonical unless people start saying Ubuntu simply to mean operating system. Courts also set a very high bar to show abandonment usually years of total nonuse. Importantly failure to enforce a mark against every potential infringer does not show abandonment. As one court explainedgtThe owner of a mark is not required to constantly monitor    every nook and cranny of the entire nation and to fire both barrels of his shotgun instantly upon spotting a possible infringer.its just become a pervasive myth.,scifi,cyh6n1l,6,t5_2qh2z

There is a goodevil dichotomy that will have to involve some politics to explore the background but it didnt need to be deep and definitely didnt need to be shallow trying to be deep which is where it ends up.  Space battles  almost always pointless and gratuitous carrying no real impact but to make you munch popcorn like the pod race.  Saber battles  usually overwrought overthought contrived and often as vapid as the space fights.  The force gets more lip service than actual respect which was really disappointing at times like when Yoda lights his shoto.

6436471,0,t1_czja93j,Lol I think you might wanna do a bit of research the original guys from the s were not even keeled guys. Astronauts are under an incredible amount of pressure to not show any weakness so your not gonna find much on them. American propaganda has created this image of super human people who are sent into space the reality is astronaut selection is often political and based more or less on arbitrary experience like the airforce. The pseudo science notion that space agencies are even able to screen out people with mental health concerns is a total farce. The nerves of steel persona most astronauts engage isnt well understood and it is a huge concern how these personalities will actually function in long term missions.,scifi,czl2i8l,3,t5_2qh2z
6443435,0,t1_czlrj8v,Because of bad writing and bad directing on Lucas part.I also dont really see how that factors into things since in a Star Wars vs Star Trek situation youd likely have all combat limited to ship to ship combat for an Empire vs Borg fight and for an Empire vs Federation fight they simply have numbers to drown the enemy in and in Trek ground combat is about as competent as in Wars.,scifi,czlshci,2,t5_2qh2z
6444829,0,t1_czl62pf,Yeah I feel like Slave was a poor addition to the series and one of the things I like least about season .  All he seemed to do was feed Avons superiority complex given how much Avon appeared to enjoy ordering him around.Then again one of the things I find most interesting about the series as a whole is the moral decay the crew undergoes.  They start as a fairly idealistic rebellion in S but by S they really are just a bunch of outlaws and pirates who are only barely better than their foes.  And I think thats largely because they lose all their morallyminded characters as the show goes on.When Villa is the closest thing they have left to a voice of reason theyre in a bad place.,scifi,czlxona,2,t5_2qh2z
6448737,0,t1_czm0zkl,While I could not fit the entire drones vs humans discussion inside a post proposing particle beam weapons I was hoping to explain how particle beam weapons would help tip the favor in the human crews direction.As an example of a boring military scifi setting I laid out the logical endgame of lasers as the dominant weapon system. It relied on having cheap drones bouncing and refocusing beams across the solar system massively redundant and extremely effective at putting gigawatts at your doorstep. If particle beam weapons can fry electronics then it becomes less cost effective to deploy fleets of cheap drones. Compare it to chemical weapons today. Every modern warship and tank has NBC protection despite chemical weapons not being used in a significant battle for decades. They do however increase the cost of tanks. My proposals aim was to give authors another tool for justifying why hordes of cheap drones are not feasible and that having one repair crew per  warships would be more cost effective than  redundant drone computers in each warship... Lasers are the ONLY coherent radiation emitting weapons. Particle beams fire atoms.Lasers can operate from radio to xray.,scifi,czmc8kq,0,t5_2qh2z

6511288,0,t1_czrzo0m,I cant really argue with someone who just calls me a liar when I state an earnestly held belief. Im not sure why you think I secretly agree with you but dont want to admit it. The systems of governance I mentioned arent supposed to rely on force. How it works out is often another matter. But I really do believe that we can achieve a higher system of government through earnest cooperation and I believe that every citizen in the conventional sense of the word who is affected by a countries laws has a right to influence how those laws are passed. I dont think that learning to kill people or shoveling shit in Mississippi for two years makes you more responsible with a vote. gtNo. Ever since fascism lead to a world war people have been trying to associate anything they dont like with fascism in order to provoke a knee jerk dislike in the uninformedThats unfair. Several of those people grew up under fascist governments or were fascists themselves. The philosophy of a social movement is never going to be a cut and dry issue. Look at the raging debates about what it means to be a conservative in this country.Still though debate is always good to sharpen the mind and I appreciate the opportunity.  gtI dont recall reading any of Gibsons books though some of the short stories sound familiar.Gibson is the shit especially if you like noir. He invented cyberpunk and is also the only person Ive read who gets the genre right. gtThe Dune books were intriguingIts weird I loved the first one to death and could not get through the sequels. gtAsimov is hit and miss for me.I feel you man hes just written so much its hard to separate the wheat from the chafe. gtAnne McCaffreys work runs from fantastic to terrible.Preach. I love the feminism but frankly the series needs a better antagonist than killer yarn. Its going to come back guys it always does!gtThe Lost Fleet seriesIsnt that based on Anabasis? Sounds neat. gtJim ButcherI like the concept of the Dresden Files a lot but I frankly found Dresden himself to be a bit of an annoying sortofchauvinist.gtLarry CorreiaI heard his books are fun but fuck that guy and his woeisme victim bullshit.

As the UT learned the language it kept replacing words until after the fourth or fifth repetition the entire phrase was translated. This bugged me. The input didnt change and the UT didnt get any new data to aid translation. If it couldnt translate the first utterance it couldnt translate the fourth fifth or ten millionth. If it could translate the fourth or fifth utterance it could translate the first. And once it has a handful of words it suddenly got perfect and translated everything fluently. Also it was a shit episode. ,scifi,d17yoh5,2,t5_2qh2z

7057595,0,t3_4c7a87,This world is intriguing and its evident youve worked on a good deal of worldbuilding for the story. This story has the potential to become quite interesting. Im an ESL teacher and I am currently teaching a creative writing course to BB English students from your writing you seem to be BC. This post primarily focuses on ways you can improve your prose quality. I intend for this to be viewed constructive criticism. I do not mean to sound pejorative in any way.All right as an ESL teacher let me tell you the best thing you can do for your writing Turn on the Spelling and Grammar check in English UK or US depending on your preference. Your spelling doesnt seem to be a problem but a Grammar check will automatically change your dialogue discussed later on and catch things like your its vs. its confusion.The biggest mechanical error you make is when you shift from past tense into present perfect tense. Exgt Yes sir said Dr. Chen.gtThe machine has started. The noise levels have started to rise rose. After a while lighting has appeared in room with the sphere leaving marks with each lighting strike?.That the general calls Chen doctor is fine but since your narrator seems rather objective I think Dr. Chen would be more suitable. And with this lightning you describe I think you mean electricity electrical discharge or arcs of plasma. In English lightning typically comes from the sky.These sorts of word choice errors are only one example of some things that a Spelling and Grammar check wont pick up. Another issue would be the formatting. In English we indent paragraphs  inch by pressing Tab once. New lines of dialogue are equally considered new paragraphs. Your dialogue grammar is inconsistent. And while you use the correct parentheses further down heres an edit of the way your first few lines should readgt They have begun said mysterious voice.gt Begin with procedure said Dr. Chen.gt It has to work this time. We have already give you so many resources that we will not tolerate another unsuccessful operation said General Wyman.gt This time it will work. I assure you said Dr. Chen.As you can see the quotation marks should stay up top even at the start and you should have commas leading into the dialogue tags. Using an actual line for a line break is just fine but just so you know an extra space between paragraphs is the standard for a jump cut in fiction.For the mysterious voice Id argue that not giving a dialogue tag would be more mysterious. When you tell readers a voice is mysterious well it becomes less mysterious no? As a reader I feel that the author is trying to tell me to feel a certain way rather than the text making me feel a certain way. Without the dialogue tag reactions tend towards confusion Whos saying this? Why are we cutting to another scene? This naturally adds more mystery.There is one WTF? moment in your piece Why would the military operatives bring a known antagonist to the center of an ongoing experiment? Perhaps Major Kerper could inform them that shes been imprisoned instead. If you want them to openly condescend to her they could load up a video call to Jenny but I think the majors reference to a party antagonistic to Chen and Wyman would be enough for an incipit as youre already juggling a lot of characters.Your descriptive paragraphs tend toward the use of direct characterization i.e. the narrator is telling the readers directly what the characters look like and gives their collective history. While direct characterization is necessary at times you want to use methods of indirect characterization as often as you can. The most important rule of creative writing is Show dont Tell. Indirect characterization is showing the characters through their actions and observations of each other. You do this with the Jenny character when shes dragged into the room by soldiers and is defiant toward the established authority as well as with the terse conversation between Dr. Chen and General Wyman.In my opinion the narrative tool which would help your prose the most would be Point of View POV. This excerpt establishes an omniscient rd person narrator. In the first scene the narrator stays rather objective and descriptive until the doctor passes out then focuses more on Wymans perspective. What would the scene look like if it was limited to Wymans perspective? How would his personality and thoughts color the ongoing scene? Certainly he wouldnt digress to outright tell us his peoples history but he might obliquely reference humanitys downfall. And as the general hed likely personally know the ships important figures such as Major Kerper Jenny and Dr. Vasilyev. His opinion of them his voice would influence the prose style and obscure some information that an otherwise omniscient narrator might want to give their readers.For example the final part of your text does this. Were in Dr. Chens damaged head as the sphere does something awfulincredible to his brain. But dig deeper into Chens experience and his psychology. Does this wealth of information frighten him to the verge of insanity or give him a God complex or a little of both?Like I said at the beginning youve got something interesting going on here. I think as you develop the story and your characters your prose and storytelling skills will equally develop. If you have questions or comments let me know and Ill try to get back to you in a reasonable amount of time.,scifi,d1gc6ab,3,t5_2qh2z

The last thing I want is to have  minutes of Owen and Beru bickering over who has to change Lukes diapers or how they cant go anywhere because they have this kid to raise when theres so many other things that could be explored.

She said it was for geeky guys that were also into Star Trek and Dungeons and Dragons. So lmao at your anecdote but I dont actually believe you. And if you do know females that are into it theyre in the minority. Itd be like little girls that preferred to play with G.I. Joes rather than Barbies. Nice try though.It is the general mindset of women dont like geeky things that I was referring to. Off the top of my head all of my female friends enjoy Star Wars every woman in my family is a fan of Star Wars hell my grandmother is the one that introduced me to Star Wars. My sister is sitting right next to me and just texted a bunch of her friends to confirm what they thought about Star Wars. They all replied that they enjoyed it. My ex and all of her friends love Star Wars.

7443996,0,t1_d2o7hzp,gt I mean come on. It was objectively better than the prequels just for starters.Better in some ways worse in others. Say what you will about the quality but even with poetry it rhymes Lucas delivered a completely original world with mostly completely new characters races technology locations and plot threads with nary a Death Star to be seen. Large portions of this movie take place on locations that are totally not Tatooine Hoth and Endor. With a Darth Vaderfigure who literally worships Vader. An Emperorfigure and a GrandMoff Tarkin figure. A third Death Star thats x bigger than the last one and that can destroy solar systems from any distance rather than planets from a close distance.Yeah Lucas was reheating s and sera tropes but with a unique take on it. He didnt choose an existing scifi or adventure serial and then copy its plot and characters almost verbatim. Yes all good artists steal and even the best movies have plot holes and bad writing in places. But theres a difference in the kind and degree of flaws these movies have. TFA is a much worse movie than any of the original trilogy and no one will be talking about it in  years on its own merits. No ones going to be quoting dialogue from it ex Thats no moon wretched hive back in greater numbers lack of faith disturbing its a trap may the force be with you pay the price for your lack of vision all of Yodas dialogue etc. etc.. What are they going to quote from this movie? Droid please? The dialogue in this movie was serviceable and thats it.Lucas overindulged in the CGI for the prequels but Abrams didnt avoid this pitfall either. Maz Kanata and Snoke are major characters and both look completely cartoony and fake Its honestly shocking in a movie with this budget that they couldnt do better. The original Yoda and Jabba the Hutt looked much more convincing than Kanata or Snoke. In the s. The squidmonster things on Hans ship also looked completely terrible and it was hard to keep them in focus long enough to even see what they were. Everything was just a blur. No ones going to remember them the way they remember the Rancor or the Sarlacc pit from the original trilogy.gtAnd this is the biggie IF the next two episodes are braver about their plots and branch out more itll be redeemed in retrospect since it was setting them up.This is what everyones hoping for. All JJ knows how to make are these rehashed soulless corporate retreads that play on peoples nostalgia. He did it with the Star Trek movies. People were hoping Star Trek  would lay the foundation for a deeper better sequel by getting us acquainted with the new characters and everything. Instead he doubled down on the references and poorly thoughtout plot and made an even shittier movie with Into Darkness.

7445871,0,t1_d2ojbl4,The old films had a very reserved directing style and relied on great scripting storytelling and deluxe quality of presentation.  TFA relies on a breakneck pace and condescends to its ADD audience at all turns.  Its not a bad film but its made me realize that Id rather not have another Star Wars film at all if theyre gonna do a rushjob by only spending a few months on the writing.  Why did Disney decide they had to crank out this film ASAP?  I would rather they spent years and years working on the script and get it perfect.  Star Wars as product is not interesting to me.  Star Wars as a perfectly executed epic saga is what I want.,scifi,d2ojqvm,8,t5_2qh2z
7446550,0,t3_4h7hk9,Fear of failure those are the key words here right? TFA is a safe movie lets not risk any kind of craaazy plot here lets... well... lets just do A New Hope again right? Everybody liked that movie so if we do it again theres a better chance of succeeding. Now we need a director not someone too visionary again we dont want to gamble too much on a movie that is guaranteed to sell either way for whatever reason so lets get JJ Abrams hes safe not great but not terrible either so we cant really go wrong with him either.I mean Disney couldve gone all out because everyone was going to see TFA but they played it so safe that I honestly think theyve wasted an opportunity to really push the envelope something that JJ Abrams is incapable of doing and I dont think that being reminded of the first movie every couple of minutes is a good thing. The sad thing is that the Force Awakens made me appreciate how the prequels at least tried to have an original story.I guess Star Wars has just become a no risk but big reward property now and if anyone has read my posts before TFA was released I had called it. I had said that Disney was playing it safe and that JJ was a safe director and frankly Id rather have seen something risky that failed instead of something safe and boring.At least though The Force Awakens was entertaining but still it felt like Paint by numbers Star Wars to me.,scifi,d2omj03,21,t5_2qh2z

Hard to say at this point but Im actually very hopeful.  They got a number of key people back and I actually think Smith being so much bigger now might have overshadowed it had he been there.

Culturally every single society on the planet divides people into two fundamental categories us and them. The definition of these categories obviously changes but they exist as what are referred to as cultural universals. I wont go so far as to say this attitude is hard wired because thats not how brains actually work but we have yet to find a society that universally accepts everyone as being part of us. Even the societies that tend to be most egalitarian huntergatherers are pretty harsh towards outsiders.

8232877,0,t1_d55g8g4,Whenever someone brings up Gene Roddenberrys intentions and plans I think we all need to remember his intentions that he had some pretty crap plans the most hilarious being his intentions for the Ferengigt One influence on the Ferengi was what Herb Wright described as Gene Roddenberrys sex fetish. In early first season discussions between them about developing the Ferengi Roddenberry let Wright know it was his intention to make the species wellendowed. He wanted to put a gigantic codpiece on the Ferengi Wright stated. He spent  minutes explaining to me all the sexual positions the Ferengi could go through. I finally said Gene this is a family show on at  on Saturdays. And of course the Ferengi stand out as yet another problem with the Star Trek aliens when Gene Roddenberry was in control that their culture tends to consist of a single personality trait.  The Ferengi are ALL greedy Americans to a comical degree and thats all they are the Klingons are ALL violent warriors and thats all the are.I get where George Takei is coming from not wanting his character changed but Star Trek clearly changes over time and Simon Pegg does have a very good point and Star Trek has clearly moved outside Gene Roddenberrys intentions a long time ago.

It felt real as if the loss was personal. Also the picture of the original crew was an awesome nod off respect. . The characterization of the main cast felt really good this time. The movie slows down for a little bit for Kirk and Spock to have a moment in the turbo lift. It could have been shatner and nimoy. . The story was self contained and really felt like a star trek plot. Cons nitpicks really. If youre going to blow up the Enterprise let it go down in a blaze of glory in a way that highlights the crews ingenuity. The first time it went down it was because Kirk was outsmarting his enemy. They could have written something in to show that the old girl was going out with one last punch. . Again if youre going to blow up the Enterprise keep it a secret. It should be a breath taking moment not something you see in the trailers. . Again again if youre going to blow up the Enterprise slow it down a little it should be a huge moment. Let the audience soak it in. It should be a HUGE scene. . Dont make the A look exactly like the  make it look like the damn A. I dont consider this a spoiler everyone knows Kirk isnt going to be the captain of anything else. I went in wanting to see how they would kelvinize the A and all I got was an exact copy of the ship they just blew up. Boring.  There even drop the line the most advanced ship yet is still in construction. Oh well. . Three for three on forgettable villains buy if it doesnt hurt marvel why should it hurt star trek.

8451978,0,t3_4v9fzu,Age . I remember the critical moment sharply. Grade  was fantastic. First year of high school. All my classmates together in home room. We then moved all together to different classes. Same faces. So I was my natural funloving childlike self. Playing games having adventures. September of the following year was Grade . Suddenly my world of friends were gone. Everyone split to different streams different classes different teachers. I rarely saw the classmates I was best friends with. Leaving after school on the bus cut short any social activities and sports. I was alone. It was so dark and depressing.After this I retreated into my shell. I rarely talked until spoken to. For the first time I started to get below average grades. Class was boring. Homework was hell. I looked in envy at all the cliques of students having fun laughing chasing each other. I didnt belong in any of them. No one picked me for teams. I was now the weird kid. I didnt choose that path. Life made me stumble. I fell crashing down and never got up. If I could go back to the first day of Grade  I would force myself to seek out and get back into the circles of friends I once had. Young kids dont ask to play tag...they just do.

Season  is chasing down Zsinj and his SSD.My combined squadron roster would be Wedge Tycho Janson Jesmin Ackbar later replaced by Lara Notsil Voort Kell Tainer Myn DonosGarik Loran combined character Ton Phanan Tyria Sarkin Ooryl Qyrgg Nawara Ven Castin Donn and Corran Horn.

8523039,0,t1_d66r567,While not the bible ancient historians also recorded peculiar events. For example In Plutarchs Lives he writes about a roman army encountering somethinggtWhile Lucullus was thus occupied Cotta thinking that his own golden opportunity had come was getting ready to give battle to Mithridates. And when tidings came from many sources that Lucullus was coming up and was already encamped in Phrygia thinking that a triumph was all but in his grasp and desiring that Lucullus have no share in it he hastened to engage the king.  But he was defeated by sea and land lost sixty vessels crews and all and four thousand footsoldiers while he himself was shut up in Chalcedon and besieged there looking for relief at the hands of Lucullus.gt Now there were some who urged Lucullus to ignore Cotta and march on into the kingdom of Mithridates assured of capturing it in its defenceless condition. This was the reasoning of the soldiers especially who were indignant that Cotta by his evil counsels should not only be the undoing of himself and his army but also block their own way to a victory which they could have won without a battle.  But Lucullus in a harangue which he made them said that he would rather save one Roman from the enemy than take all that enemys possessions. And when Archelas who had held command for Mithridates in Boeotia and then had abandoned his cause and was now in the Roman army stoutly maintained that if Lucullus were once seen in Pontus he would master everything at once Lucullus declared that he was at least as courageous as the hunter he would not give the wild beasts the slip and stalk their empty lairs.  With these words he led his army against Mithridates having thirty thousand footsoldiers and twentyfive hundred horsemen. But when he had come within sight of the enemy and seen with amazement their multitude he desired to refrain from battle and draw out the time. But Marius whom Sertorius had sent to Mithridates from Spain with an army came out to meet him and challenged him to combat and so he put his forces in array to fight the issue out.  But presently as they were on the point of joining battle with no apparent change of weather but all on a sudden the sky burst asunder and a huge flamelike body was seen to fall between the two armies. In shape it was most like a winejar and in colour like molten silver. Both sides were astonished at the sight and separated.  This marvel as they say occurred in Phrygia at a place called Otryae.gtBut Lucullus feeling sure that no human provision or wealth could maintain for any length of time and in the face of an enemy so many thousands of men as Mithridates had ordered one of the captives to be brought to him and asked him first how many men shared his mess and then how much food he had left in his tent.  When the man had answered these questions he ordered him to be removed and questioned a second and a third in like manner. Then comparing the amount of food provided with the number of men to be fed he concluded that within three or four days the enemys provisions would fail them. All the more therefore did he trust to time and collected into his camp a great abundance of provisions that so himself in the midst of plenty he might watch for his enemys distress.,scifi,d66xwoi,2,t5_2qh2z

Likewise the movies generally lean heavily towards one of the three with only smatterings of the others.

9290118,0,t1_d8tgbkr,I like to think of it in terms of percieved time. Perception collapses the waveform and forces reality to decide on a particular path. see two slit experiment and associated material. Time travel would imo of course essentially undo perceived time forward of the emergence point of the time traveler making the future uncertain again PBS Time Space did an youtube episode about a so called Quantum Eraser which talks about this retroactive deletion effect as applied to two slit experiment. I think that no there is only one future but it has to collapsed though what we perceive as linear time and until that happens any future is potentially possible.My arguement would be that it would be impossible for the future to collapse into so long as time travelers exist therefore the only valid future would be the one where time travelers dont exist so even if time travel is possible any set of events that prevents time travel becomes infinitely more likely than than uncontrolled time travel. ,scifi,d8tl7ts,1,t5_2qh2z

He only allowed it after his publisher put their foot down and said they wouldnt publish his books at all unless he let them put them out digitally.Now he was admittedly pretty technophobic.

I could go on.......but I am going to take a friggin chill pill and pick up the thread again. I fucking loved the books and want to see how they continue the story on screen.Edit  okay Im being a smartypants I know that a lot of these are pure tropes how would I the wannabe director direct shoot this stuff? The couches should have been couches. Have them as tough looking  white foam blocks at the start.... something reminiscent of a cross between Kirks captains chair and a dentists chair rendered in flocked marshmallow. Totally incongruous with the rest of the ship.At g the actors end up sitting on the surface without sinking in but as we accelerate they sink deeper and deeper on set we reel back an actor shaped cutout in the memory foam and their hair and uniforms get pinned back. Tears form in eyes and run back over their cheeks as fast as bullets and cheeks deform with a teeny bit of cgi or an insert in the actors mouth which is part of their mouth guard.

Id love to have seen Karl Urban do a modern take on Bones over say a  or episode season.You hit the nail on the head.  I felt like there were decent stories in those movies that got drowned out by trying to make a twohour action movie with a story underneath.  With Wrath of Khan at least you can look at the way Kirk behaved on the TV show and compare it.

10316476,0,t1_dcd5ouf,Ah. No  you cant really add only authors whose politicla leanings you align with.  Ive enjoyed a few of Cards works. I find Enders Game a bit of a MarySue wishfulfillment epic but some of his short stories are awesome.   this is the first of his stories I ever read back in Omni magazine a long time ago and its still magnificent  Ive also enjoyed Heinlein and Pournelle  and at the same time while I certainly skew liberal there are a lot of books by writers who lean that way that I find dull. Overt politics in the stories or books? Hey. I loved Starship Troopers. Still do. On the other hand I also love Ursula LeGuins science fiction. And I recall having a discussion with someone the other day  I dont do namedropping but youd know the name for sure  who remarked that it used to be possible for SF writers to have opposing politics but still have a really good time together as friends at conventions. Thats about where I stand. There was a time when the fiction counted for more than the political stance. There was a time when the storytelling was as important as the literary quality of the prose. I miss that.,scifi,dcdffr7,1,t5_2qh2z
10318348,0,t1_dcdffr7,Thats what Im saying though that its a dumb categorization that needs to be tossed like literary or populist. A book shouldnt have to be the most popular or worthiest or most correct for your leanings or whatever for you to enjoy reading it or to get something out of it. The tribalism on all sides is ridiculous and one of the many reasons I enjoy sci fi is that you can see how things play out with different rules or different interpretations of society. At worst its knowing your enemy and at best it can lead to a more common understanding with them. Theres even something to be said for situational politics. I mean Im pretty liberal as well but very strong authoritarian tendencies might be appropriate under a species threatening alien invasion. I especially respect authors who seem to be able to look at politics from a few different sides and show that theres good and bad in all systems. Or take someone like Vinge Rainbows End has some aspects to it that I think make some sympathetic points towards those who feel they are being left behind as do most good person out of their time stories.I totally agree with both you and your friend even if the closest I really get to the community is the occasional post here and my local stores bookshelves. Im tired of everyone being so wrapped up in being right that they cant just write something. I totally agree that the story should be first and that everything else should be supporting that. I just want characters that I care about getting into some interesting situations and then getting out of them or not depending. Sometimes I want high brow sometimes low mostly middle. Sometimes I want epic space battles between Good and Evil and sometimes I want small slices of life where everyone is miserable every word is fraught with allusions and hidden meanings and deciphering what is really going on is a challenge. Overall I just want to feel like I didnt waste my time or money reading it. I definitely agree with what you said in your original post as well to judge any of the above as better or worse is kind of silly. Theyre all different and as long as they are enjoyable in some way for the reader that should be all that really matters. ,scifi,dcdn2q0,3,t5_2qh2z

So I start paying for Netflix I dont steal just cause I can. I feel if I can pay for it sure why not. Still cant get the Expanse. Already have it called up on TPB waiting for the first ep to come up. Amazon Prime Japan is not much better. They still dont have season  of Man in the High Castle. So even though I am paying for these services I find myself still pirating the TV all over again I finsihed season ... pirated... and its STILL not in Japan where I paid to watch it. At least they are getting some money from me but.... it makes little sense in the scheme of things. Here ya go guys I am gonna give you cash... but still have to pirate what I want because for some reason you just dont want to release without some weird ritual of black magic and voodoo I know there are valid legal and localization issues involved but some of these companies get pretty fucking shitty with them. Netflix gets stuff at the same time while Amazon in Japan gets shit like  months later. And then you have cluster fucks like Expanse!,scifi,dd8hsoq,56,t5_2qh2z

For example the economy in the Culture series is plausible but also completely detached from our reference.If you are looking at a series that delves deeply into the interactions of science technology economics and sociology I believe the Foundation series is the goto choice and dare I say the original defining work in the area. The series presents an aging Empire in slow but terminal decline due to the universewide Empire being controlled in policy and trade from a single ruling world with an Emperor. In order to enable such a phenomenon the ruling world has become massively overspecialized in various tasks to such a degree that innovation no longer takes place and science is no longer considered the driving factor behind growth but rather bureaucracy.

Its not that it wasnt science fictiony enough its that it was a little hollow a little forgettable. Its a low point for Villeneuvebut a high point for Amy Adams she almost redeemed the movie just on acting alone.I dont think this is necessarily all Villeneuves fault though. The script was awful. Jeremy Renner was incredibly underused again and his character doesnt seem to be there for any reason the physics side of things is never delved into. The bombing the hypermilitant Chinese none of it seemed to matter in the end. Just a bunch of things happening.It was constructed well. The flashbacksflashforwards were seamlessly integrated into the body of the film it was shot well the acting was top notch.

11242413,0,t3_60gesz,Watched the pilot last night. As with most pilots you need to take the finished product with a grain of salt and hope that the more egregious parts of the show will be fixed for the full premier season.Acting Solid hits and wide misses. Richard Madden and Mark Addy are superb and both Game of Thrones alums as Robb Stark and Robert Baratheon. Haley Joel Osmont is good. The rest of the cast are one note and overacted. Hoping that a full season will give the writers and actors more time to develop subtlety to the characters.Production limited sets somewhat cliche design. A full seasons budget for sets and props could do wonders. Hopefully design will get more nuanced...Direction good camera work pacing. Dialogue is a bit on the nose. If they keep the same director and camera folks and bring in someone to clean up the scripts Id look forward to watching the rest of the reason.,scifi,df6b7f3,27,t5_2qh2z
