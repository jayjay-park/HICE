2735226,0,t1_cnez72d,That sucks that your friend was a victim of burglary and I admire you for wanting to help There are a few things here which may make things difficult If the police did not examine the scene or take any evidence then anything you find probably wont be able to be used in an investigation. Its important for the police to do this as then there will be a chain of evidence etc.Im unsure on the quality of the marks you will have been able to obtain from the objects with the equipment available to you but I would be interested to see them. Hardest stage really is getting something to compare them too. As far as the victim goes you can use ink on their fingers rolled onto a piece of paper and this should be of an ok quality. I am really not sure how you are going to get a good quality set of fingerprints from your suspect. If you try and get marks from something they have touched then remember that each finger has a different print so you would need all  fingers!This is logistically difficult but we could at least see if what you have matches the victim!

3818004,0,t3_345irh,They didnt even touch drylabbing and related laboratory scandals!These are all the big examples programs hit. The NAS report really shook up what was a growing problem. Response has mostly made sense. Im a bit confused and upset at the OSAC grouping. There has to be proper training as well as reporting limitations among many other things. The scientific method applies to what disciplines use science. The rest is reconstruction. And we have to do a better job of presenting that.,forensics,cqrhehk,5,t5_2qim5

6442112,0,t3_437lwy,Thanks for the mention ulifefindsawaySorry for the late response. Firstly I work in DNA so my insight is limited. However I can say thisa Every job has its monotony and paperwork to varying degrees and every person has their own preference for a place on that spectrum. The only suggestion I would make is to ask to shadow for a day or two so you can get an idea of what the typical day will be like. I personally dont feel like my job is too monotonous or overly bureaucratic for my own liking.b Im sure you know the salary youll be looking at for this position but the entry level jobs techs in a lab are probably going to pay less than your teaching job. However entering directly into the better paid analyst positions is harder if you havent put in the grunt work. Dont forget to factor in benefits. Government work generally has pretty good benefits.Moving up beyond that typically means supervisory or technical lead positions. Also will you be working out of a jail? I know several BAC workers work out of jails and that means a certain clientele and often working nights.  ,forensics,czlnjis,1,t5_2qim5

I dont want you to think Im against their presence or anything. Theres nothing wrong with becoming an officer and getting experience through their eyes.

9299657,0,t1_d8urlnh,Most positions wont have you going to the scene and then running the tests back in the lab.  The exception to this is that some labs have evidence response teams where the lab people go out to help with the crime scene however this is usually on a rotationalsporadic basis.  Doing the dexter work would be mostly crime scene investigation.  You would work all types of scenes not just homicide.  Undergrad forensic programs would probably include coursework in crime scene investigation.  Many programs offer a focus track that allow you to take more elective courses to prepare you more for a specific career path.  Just take a look at curricula from different programs and see what fits you best.If you visit www.aafs.org there is a link for student resources.  This link lists all accredited forensic programs... ,forensics,d8usqrq,3,t5_2qim5

It cant hurt to have a knowledge of both sides lawscience since there is definitely job related crossover.  However you wont find a job where youre practicing law and doing forensic lab work at least not that I know of  the same is true in reverse.Id say you probably pick one since the educational paths are so much different.  Pick elective courses as your program allows in the other area you dont choose to focus on.  I hope that helps you out some.,forensics,d92hb2p,2,t5_2qim5
