1189309,0,t1_ci3edyw,Ok the internet was created with government funds using some private researchers and university professors. Still it wasnt built for profit. It was built as a tool. The sheer amount of cash that was spent on the space program would never have been possible with a private organization. SpaceX would never have risked the capital especially since even now its only barely profitable. How many launches are using old ICBMs?You have no proof that medical advances would not have needed government spending. Sure somethings would be pushed but something like the Polio vaccine would never have been used as widespread if the vaccine had been patented or if the gov didnt pay to inject it in so many people. Even today vaccines are not big profit makers but the government forces pharma to produce them. Remember theres money in treating sickness but not much in preventing it. Ok see you are making the false assumption that Cuba and North Korea are symbols of socialism when they are authoritarian regimes. They are the failure of idealized socialism  and they are why I support Social Democracy.  The thing is that I support science based solutions because they work.  There is no science backing up libertarianism nor in the purely capitalistic system. A laissez faire system fails societies. It works great for a few but not so good for the many. So you take what positives it does have and blend it with the positives that socialism has and you end up with a result. Capitalism works great for things you want more of at a cheaper price cars phones gasoline.  Socialism works great for things you want less of with a better quality of life law enforcement healthcare roads. Social Democracy blends these two things.  Capitalism is much like eating consumption of food keeps you alive but if there is no limit then you will eat yourself to death. Socialism is like exercising it keeps you healthy but if there is no limit then you will starve. Compromise with a regulated eating and exercise program. oh and one last thing Cuba is actually doing pretty well for a tiny island with few natural resources and a massive trade embargo against it.  If you compare the lifestyle of Cubans with any of the other Caribbean Island Nations without these embargoes they are doing really quite well. ,StPetersburgFL,ci3ezld,2,t5_2ryyn

The homeowners pay the cost of the panels over time and sell any excess power the systems generate. Southern states several of which cherish low electricity rates afforded by extensive use of coal typically have far fewer solar incentives. Several also have rules that specifically discourage homeowners from going solar.

In summer sunrise and sunset are more north and in winter theyre more south. Longer days in summer peak at the solstice literally means sun stop and gradually shorten until the fall equinox. At the equinox theyre equal. BTWgtIt is when the sun is at its greatest distance from the meridian latitude on Central Avenue.This is gibberish. Meridian is any longitude northsouth line around the globe. If it means the sun is furthest from the equator a latitude it could mean solstice I suppose.
