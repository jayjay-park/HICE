10445716,0,t3_5pdpbi,th place Ireland Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan Rock n Roll Kids points from urealphali Ranked ndThe song Ireland sent because it was too boring to win and not only did it win  but it set a points record at . Ive always liked this one its calm nice and doesnt try too hard like many other ballads. Some find it boring I find it gentle and relaxing. points from uspirit Ranked ndI usually am not to fond of slow songs but this is really sweet and I still listen to it occasionally points from unothhhh Ranked rd points from ulaneyflitt Ranked thThis is a really nice slow song. Its not a song for all occasions but if I were in the mood for a slow song then I would love to listen to this. points from udeannadeesse Ranked thIts pretty decent. They sound really good together. Its definitely a slow song... But its one of the better ones. points from uestoniass Ranked th points from ujcbb Ranked thHugely overrated I dont see what is so good about this. Its pretty boring and probably one of my least favourite winners.Total Score  pointsAverage Score . pointsAverage Rank .Difference from European Ranking ,esctournament,dcs3voz,1,t5_3e9hx
