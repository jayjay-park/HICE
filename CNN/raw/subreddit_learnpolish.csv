Ive wanted to tell you for a long time but I have no idea what to begin with. I dont know how youre going to react but ultimately you have to find out. Im really sorry because of that and I hope you wont be hurt. Im going to say it right here right now as I cant stand it anymore. Eh... the thing is you are... illegible... Dont get me wrong I just want you to know the truth...Its pretty ironic how the most important word in the letter is illegible.

5102175,0,t1_cty0i86,No its not like sz in words. Sometimes it is but its because it loses voicing if used near other unvoiced sounds or in the end of a word. Rarely the opposite thing can happen so a sound can become voiced if used near other voiced sounds. If you dont know whats the difference between voiced and unvoiced consonants see the following pairskgpbtdfvszetc.Now the exampleskrzyk pronunced k|sz|y|k after an unvoiced kmarzanna pronunced m|a||a|long n|a never pronunced m|a|sz|a|long n|a between two vowels vowels are almost always voicedelementarz pronunced e|l|e|m|e|n|t|a|sz end of a worddach domu normally d|a|ch d|o|m|u but in some dialects in fast speech it can be d|a|voiced ch d|o|m|u end of a word BUT the next word has a voiced dIn the end it is not a big mistake to use a voiced version pronuncing krzyk as k||y|k. The thing is it is much more difficult to pronunce it this way smoothly so the more smooth your speech is the less voicing there will be.,learnpolish,cv102us,1,t5_2u72v

6739593,0,t3_47xiz3,ChorusKa normalnym by mineraln pi | They tell you to be a regular person to drink mineral waterNaogom mwi nie to to y nie da si | To say no to bad habits thats just not the way one wants to liveLekarze mwi e ju za pno jest | Doctors say its too lateA ja centralnie mam jak ja kocham ten stan | But I totally love this state of mindst stanzaChcesz by normalny ale masz dylemat teraz | You want to be just a regular man but you have a dilemmaJest tyle piknych zasad do zamania | So many cool rules to breakI Nobla nie dostaniesz za normalny kady dzie | And you dont get a Nobel Prize for every regular dayycie to akademia jak dzie wira | Life is an academy like one day of a madmanst stanzaZwyka krytyka za plecami znowu kopie ci | Regular haters are talking behind your back againNiech nie zapomni z tyu pocaowa | But they can kiss your arseTo twoje ycie tylko ty masz prawo przey je | Its your life only you have the right to live itModa na klony mija chcesz by sob | Being a clone is not cool any more you want to be yourselfampnbsp Drinking mineral water is somewhat associated with a healthy lifestyle as Poland has quite an abundance of sources and various healthy waters are cheap and widely available.  To to  a somewhat archaic form meaning more or less przecie ale but with a tinge of a shocked surprise. E.g. To to zwyka kradzie!  But that is no more than robbery! said an old lady when she heard the prices on the market.Also nie da si  is an idiomatic phrase meaning simply not being possible for objective reasons. Many times used to excuse ones lack of knowledgelaziness too.  Bad habits as in nag pl. naogi comprise alcohol cigarettes coffee and generally all daily habits which are bad for health. Do not confuse with the word nawyk which means habit but these can be anything not particularly bad. Actually in Polish it sorta sounds as if the person singing was in a terminal state of cancer. Centralnie means centrally but it is used in terms of slang and it then means totally in every way. Usually used in phrases like On jest centralnie pojebany He is totally fucked up sometimes it can also mean straight onto badly hard and so on By najebany i centralnie przypierdoli w tramwaj  He was wasted like hell and crashed with the tram fucking badly. Mam tak centralnie will mean I am just like that in every way. Mie tak is also sort of colloquial and means to be just such a person to like it the certain way and not able to help it. It conveys a tone of fatalism and many say so in order to excuse themselves as well. This line is generally confusing in terms of grammar. I am guessing that the author had to stick to the music and omitted some words. It can be interpreted in a couple of ways. Similarly it is not really specified what state is meant in the song drunken? fun?. On the other hand disco polo is not a demanding genre songs are not really meant to have a meaning and the lyrics is rather secondary.  Lit. beautiful. Dzie wira Madmans day is a title of a Polish film. A story about a middleaged man who feels like he lost his life. Very depressive was meant to be a comedy failed badly. Bad acting stupid plot. It nevertheless gained somewhat a cult following in bad chavvy neighbourhoods and for some people the title is a sort of an idiom denoting something like go crazy do whatever life is pointless no future. Krytyka means criticism but in this case it rather stand for haters. Especially that it says za plecami kopie so literally speaking it kicks you behind your back. Lit. They ought not to forget to kiss your rear. The author probably wanted it to be a sarcastically polite version of kiss my arse. Moda na ...  this is in fashion popular hit of a season.ampnbspBtw it is tumaczenie piosenki not tumaczenie piosence. Also nie rozumiem piosenki nie znajduj tumaczenia  the case changes when the verb is negated.Why this song if I might ask?,learnpolish,d0gfk4h,8,t5_2u72v
6959627,0,t1_d1575am,Verbs in past tense are slightly different. Its mostly just am f. instead of em m. but few are irregular e.g. i  m. szedem f. szam. However it concerns not only how femalesmales talk themselves but also how you talk about somebody in second or third person. E.g. you went would be szedesza sing. mf or szlicieszycie pl. he went  szed she went  sza they went  szliszy etc. Adjectives are also gendersensitive a little similar like in French. Although it mostly comes down to ya sing. mf and ie pl. endings. And of course some nouns e.g. depicting persons have two forms like friend  przyjacielprzyjacika.And of course women talk more.
