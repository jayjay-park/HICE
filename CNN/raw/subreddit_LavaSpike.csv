9426903,0,t3_59pq60,Some notes most Boros decks run  Flames of the Bloodhand in the main and more in the board. The list Im running doesnt use green in the  instead opting for  wear tear and  smash. This thread might also be better posted in rmodernmagic or rspikes,LavaSpike,d9axb2v,2,t5_3c1do
10489664,0,t3_5q1xg1,My recommendation is that you need the fewest fetches possible to ensure that the number of fetches in your deck is a majority of your mana base.So for  land lists  fetches is correct.  For  and  land lists  fetches is correct.  ,LavaSpike,dcx43ga,3,t5_3c1do
11095036,0,t1_depff3k,CB is usually a one or two of in the  although some players seem to really hate burn and play more than that. Usually you hope to dodge it. If you get hit by it then so be it. Time to start drawing well. Its pretty hard for burn to play around especially on the draw.The biggest thing going for burn is that CB is pretty bad in any match up that is not burn. Its a bad removal spell bad discard spell bad burn spell and bad life gain spell. The card is versatile enough to be main deckable but no one should play more than  unless RDW is really overrepresented in your meta. If a decklist contains  or  CB it would probably be better off replacing some of them with more powerful dedicated discard or removal spells.Sadly sometimes you play against the guy who really hates burn and runs the playset of CB. Sure they are favoured against you but they have sacrificed a lot in many other match ups. All you can really do is try to catch them with AtarkasSkullcrack and maybe in some weird cases slow roll your creatures. Not recommending that though. Better to just hope they dont have it imo.,LavaSpike,depm2bf,1,t5_3c1do
11168514,0,t1_dexd47n,x Path is fine  just because your running x Path doesnt mean youll have to board them all in for the flaky MUs like Death Shadow or Tasiger. Youll just use the lot of them in the MUs where they shine like against Eldrazi Robots Fish Midrange and Aggro.,LavaSpike,dexxtn0,2,t5_3c1do

11588547,0,t1_dg9kbvx,At  of the meta you are going to be facing Burn at least once a night for an FNM.  The odds that youll face insert deck here are severely diminished by that kind of showing for a single deck.Its extreme but hes also dealing with an unhealthy metagame.As for Kor Firewalker let her block then Skullcrack.  Because Protections interaction with combat damage is damage prevention Skullcrack stops it.  The Firewalker then dies.  Also Path should be a of in any burn sideboard to deal with creatures that Bolt doesnt kill.,LavaSpike,dg9ki0m,3,t5_3c1do
