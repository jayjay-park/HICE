I hardly even notice it.It was way worth it for me just because it was so cheap for me.It ended up only being a couple bucks a week even if it leads to one more sale its like  ROI. my profit per item were like at least .,EtsySellers,cg0brsn,1,t5_2wthr
2154860,0,t3_2j8dpe,Eh I dont know why they bother. I think they waste their time and resources on stuff that doesnt matter. It is because it effects me but I dont like their categories. I sell Glass Marble Magnets and when I list them I put them in the Magnet Category. Yet I cant find a magnet category in home kitchen or office. Why offer it for me to place there if there is no category by that name?Unless someone else has figured out how to find that category in which case Id love to hear it. ,EtsySellers,cldqccw,1,t5_2wthr
