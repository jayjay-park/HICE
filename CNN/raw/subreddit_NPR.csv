We all know that our smartphone is a computer and not a woman.  I know my car is not a man.  I know my dog is not a people although he doesnt.  We as people personify things its natural.  The corporations involved in this conduct focus groups to find out which groups of people prefer which sounds.  Turns out in the US we men and women find the sound of a female more appealing.  In some euro countries they use a man so they must find male voices more pleasing.Instead of framing the women are subservient argument perhaps you look at Siri as the voice of the internet.  Maybe you look at it as When people have questions who do they go to when they need answers?  They turn to a woman.  But that doesnt fit with their offended narrative of the world.  If Siri was voiced by a man their argument would be Why are the smartphones men?  Why as a woman do I have to turn to a man for advice?  Why couldnt it be a woman?  Why must women beg men for internet advice?rant,NPR,cm9ccy3,3,t5_2qnbd

They use that money to pay their bills including powering that antenna creating their own content such as local news or other programs and paying NPR amp PRI to license their content and other IP related issues. NPR does help subsidize their affiliate stations from a general fund but that can only do so much because there are so many of them.Think about it like going to a fast food franchise. Your meal pays the workers at that location and keeps them in business. But it also keeps the parent company in business because the franchise location has to buy supplies marketing and license trademarks and alike from the parent company. But it doesnt really help other franchise locations.For example if you go to a Subway in PlanoTX it helps that location and the parent corporation but it doesnt help the Subway in Billings MT directly and they still need people to eat there.,NPR,dcvltx4,2,t5_2qnbd
