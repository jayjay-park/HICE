2197662,0,t3_2k2ria,Ever play Evil Within? I havent feel sweaty palm when playing horror game for a long time. Scarce amount of bullet almost impossible to beat monsters and intriguing storyline. Very statisfying.    Also finished Ryse Son of Rome Valiant Hearts Metro  Redux Metro Last Light Deadpool Murdered Souls and Middle Earth Shadow of mordor and Prototype  last week. One game per day. One game at a time. Now downloading Civ Beyond earth.,IndonesianGamers,clj6e0h,2,t5_30umj
