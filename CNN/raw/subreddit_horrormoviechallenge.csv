2120238,0,t1_cl9bh6y,I was impressed at how good some of the gore effects were. There was a fun horror film in there somewhere but it was difficult to get past the sheer unpleasantness of the rape scenes.,horrormoviechallenge,cl9bty6,2,t5_2s4r5
2161129,0,t1_clbvu2g,Dat narration!gt A vampire in ancient belief was a malignant spirit who when the earth lost its sunlight rose nightly from its dark grave to suck blood from the throats of the living. Its powers were many. It could see in the dark which was no small ability in a world halfveiled from light. Its hypnotic skills baffled the domain of science. It was of a cunning more than mortal for its cunning was a growth of ages since it could not die by the mere passing of time. It had to have been by a wooden stake driven deep into its heart or exposure to the rays of the sun which would instantly decompose its body into a miasma of putrid decay. The believers of this superstition referred to vampires as the living dead. I seem to be making use of the past tense. Perhaps the present would be more precise for it stands to reason that if one is superstitious even on a small seemingly insignificant level one must be vulnerable to all superstitions conceivably even those of vampires. I like that Yorga keeps it old school. Hes in the USA of the s but hes still rocking the classic cape and calling himself a Count. Its actually consistent with something I noticed in Byzantium where the vamps are pretty much frozen in the state they were in when they turned. A lack of any kind of significant personal growth over the centuries seems to be the source of undoing for a lot of vampires. But really I want to isolate the narration along with the laughter at the end and add it to my Halloween mix to play while trick or treaters are coming by. ,horrormoviechallenge,clej1q1,3,t5_2s4r5
5312865,0,t1_cvok7s8,Its like the antithesis of Twilight and the modern day influx of Vampire movies these last however many years.  And it has Lance Henriksen. Im a pretty big fan of this flick too!,horrormoviechallenge,cvqs4ct,2,t5_2s4r5
5543945,0,t3_3qzb9c, films done and dusted. Just did not have time to watch a nd film of Night OF The Demons remake with Tiffany Shepis which would have completed my checklist. I wathed  films though. To be honest I dont even like the remake of Night of The Demons and was just going to watch it for the checklists sake. ,horrormoviechallenge,cwka005,2,t5_2s4r5
