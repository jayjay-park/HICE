1370939,0,t1_cio4hyx,Alright Ive got that that part but I guess Im confused about if I keep going to the spirit camps and I continue to not get a contract is there a point where it becomes visible that if I want to march I need to go to MCDC?,dci,cio4w2i,3,t5_2t8mr

4955549,0,t1_cuj69wq,Ohh they must have meant they were going to run through what they considered their part  of their show. Outside of school I joined a DCA corps after my sophomore year where I learned how to play the baritone. ,dci,cuj6r4l,1,t5_2t8mr

6063504,0,t3_3yje1v,I hear a soothing mellophone solo. I like it a lot. Ive always wanted to hear a corps do something from Karel Husas Music for Prague  specifically Movement IV Toccata and Chorale   I know that Carolina Crown played a small part of Music of Prague as the intro in their  program Chess and the Art of Strategy but it was such a small part and all percussion. ,dci,cyef2qj,2,t5_2t8mr
6313768,0,t1_cz5jlm3,Thank you! I try my best to always be positive and take every advice they give me. I will set a time to practice because Im not that bad its just I havent done it in a while. Thanks for the advice and for helping out,dci,cz7b06h,1,t5_2t8mr
6685085,0,t3_474nu0,not a real corps but... Future Corps from Disney.  Man those guys could really play and it would be awesome to do that every day for a summer. Just so I could do this every day ,dci,d0asog3,1,t5_2t8mr
7172720,0,t3_49v0m6,Just a random thought but maybe this would be a bad idea because woodwinds are much more delicate and high maintenance than brass instruments. Without woodwinds you can continue to practice outdoors even in the rain which is useful for random rain showers that occur during the summer. Get a woodwind wet and it will need to have the pads replaced depending on the damage. Even though I agree with the statement that we need to stay true to the heart of the activity it is also an issue of practicality.,dci,d1tgyhu,1,t5_2t8mr

8379292,0,t1_d5oiokg,I agree The Bluecoats were on a whole different level than anyone last night in my opinion. Sure the Cavies and Crown were amazing but what the Bluecoats did last night was beyond anything i could have imagined.,dci,d5oykw8,2,t5_2t8mr
