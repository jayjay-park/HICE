I took it apart took off the lockbar stabilizer and using two pairs of pliers cushioned by rubber to prevent scratching I just carefully bent the lockbar back. It made no visible difference but the feel of flipping it went from hurts my finger every single time to flips quite comfortable. Still has a great detent but its no longer painful at least to me which was a huge improvement and saved me the time of sending it back to ZT and waiting until they fixed it and then waiting some more until they sent it back.,Knife_Swap,cqxkny3,2,t5_2tgpv

Sometimes if someones asking about a knife I dont have for sale BUT its a knife Ill consider parting with Ill pull a number out of my ass probably on the high side because I dont want to get rid of that particular knife THAT badly at that time.Anyone can look at my price and decide to not buy it.  Supply and demand.  If you have an ostensibly used knife even if it hasnt been used and its marked for sale for  under the price I could get it from Amazon Im not likely to buy your knife.  Most people arent.  That particular knife wont sell until the seller either finds the perfect buyer who cant be bothered to find it somewhere else or he lowers his price to meet demand.Edit  I think its a selfcorrecting problem is what Im saying.
