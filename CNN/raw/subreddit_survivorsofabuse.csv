1707719,0,t1_cju3jhl,Cbt is going well though have only had a couple of treatment sessions as the assessment took  sessions. Im willing to try anything at this point as in the past I didnt think it would work for me. However the progress Ive made in talking therapy has given me the drive to work harder. Being patient is never something I do well so thank you again. Just the words I need to keep me going . ,survivorsofabuse,cjuf4dx,1,t5_2t3ms
3177027,0,t3_2wegna,Hi your experiences definitely were that bad its common to minimize or deny the severity of what happened but what happened to you was definitely very bad and wrong and no child should have had to go through any of that. Im so sorry about everything you went through. It sounds like youve never tried therapy it sounds like you could really benefit from this too as you seem to have a lot of unresolved issues stemming from your abuse and experiences as a child. If money is an issue Ive heard that many professionals work on a sliding scale basis where you agree on a fee that you can afford I think many professionals would hopefully be open to doing this too. one place you could consider contacting meanwhile or for more information regarding this is RAINN  they have a telephone hotline to offer advicesupport and an online chat style hotline. I can totally understand struggling with friendships relationships and life generally after all those terrible experiences. It sounds to me though like therapy could be ideal and very really helpful for you for all of these different issues and maybe help you see options and ideas you can try to make your life easier and help you cope better etc. I have the same insecurities regarding friendships it is very tough. ,survivorsofabuse,coraq6i,1,t5_2t3ms

You have to muster up all the strength you have and then some more and then end it for good. I know it feels like you cant but trust me when shit hits the fan you HAVE to and then you can  so you can now too you just dont know it yet ,survivorsofabuse,ct3uxhj,1,t5_2t3ms
4880573,0,t3_3hqoym,I experience this as well. My therapist says its fairly common for survivors of abuse to go through. We might never get certain memories back but if theyre really traumatic maybe thats a good thing.,survivorsofabuse,cu9qfgh,4,t5_2t3ms
5367269,0,t3_3litle,Please feel free to contact me.  Your story mirrors mine very closely.  My parents were older I am older than you by  years so they are most likely your grandparents age.  My mother turned a blind eye to the physical and sexual abuse that my father put me through.  I still struggle with it but am learning day to day how to accept and deal with it.  I didnt admit it happened until recently.  I was also raped when I was  went through a period of hypersexuality trying to regain my ownership of my own body survived multiple abusive relationships because I was drawn to men that would treat me how my father would.  Yours is a terribly rough road to travel.  I am also working on a masters degree in hopes of helping troubled teens. I hope that my own terrible experiences can someday help someone else so that they in someway do not go to waste.  Find power in  your ability to survive.  You are obviously a very intelligent woman you deserve to overcome this and you will.  ,survivorsofabuse,cvxq9h4,1,t5_2t3ms
5422776,0,t3_3p86j2,ahhhhh. i hate this its also the case with my gc brother. and of course to hear my parents tell it they never ever laid a hand on me. you have to believe in the things you know are true. did you make up the details about what they hit you with and in what room? you know in your bones what is true even if your whole family denies it.  your ptsd is proof your memories are proof. your brother is safer because he didnt realize and doesnt remember. its hard for me because my gc brother basically had completely different parents. they REALLY never hit him. but i guess i also appreciate that. he has a better life. trust yourself you know what is true. youre not insane. its all over now you survived youre awesome. you cant wait for that validation theres no guarantee it will come. you remember thats what matters. you know. ,survivorsofabuse,cw4te8u,2,t5_2t3ms
5712443,0,t3_3tcdcc,Healing is not linear. I too was surprised to be hit with an emotional bomb when I thought I had laid my past to rest. Sometimes we have to relearn what we thought we had down pat or kick recovery up a notch. It can feel a bit like one step forward two steps back at times. The good news is these phases get shorter and less frequent as time goes on. You also get more skilled at doing things like shutting down negative self talk and excessive rumination. Hang in there. What youre feeling is completely normal. As for books the drama of the gifted child is golden. Look into CBT...Feeling good the new mood therapy explains it...you can use CBT methods on your own and it is quite effective. ,survivorsofabuse,cx56ni7,2,t5_2t3ms
5723172,0,t3_3tefha,Maybe your not gaining what you need from therapy. It would probably be best for you to let your therapist know this. Also it sounds like your mother is really bad for your mental health as well.,survivorsofabuse,cx6ile2,1,t5_2t3ms

5993633,0,t3_3x66eq,You did not deserve what happened to you Garrett sounds like a sadist.  I know what its like to want to feel loved that youll do just about anything to get whatever love you can.  I was sexually abused by my first boyfriend and it has taken me many years to feel relaxed enough in my body to accept physical love and attention from someone.  My advice is to be gentle with yourself go at your own pace not anyone elses connect with your body through yoga being in nature meditation swimming dancing whatever feels right to you write in a journal about your feelings and forgive yourself for allowing the abuse.  The last one is the hardest one imo because its so easy to blame yourself but the reality is what he did was wrong very wrong and you were simply holding onto whatever love you could have and feel safe with.  You trusted him more than other people in your life which shows how easy it was to let him do what he wanted.  There is nothing wrong with trusting someone you just need to learn how to trust people who are good for you. The more you learn to love yourself your body and who you inherently are the easier it will be to forgive yourself move on and accept new and better experiences.,survivorsofabuse,cy5anov,2,t5_2t3ms
6052820,0,t3_3ydjm4,Some states do not begin to run the statute of limitations for sexual abuse until the victim receives the memories from that abuse.So if you were  when you first remembered sexual abuse from when you were  then the statute would begin running at that time until you were  years old.  Do you live in one of the many states with that rule? In which case you can make a report. ,survivorsofabuse,cyd0xb2,2,t5_2t3ms

6618352,0,t3_43pnio,Dear gearnut it sounds like youve done an impressive amount of work in understanding your abuse amp your moms...especially at such a young age. People can break the cycle of abuse amp youve already started breaking it.I also was worried about the cycle of abuse especially when I started having children. My flashbacks actually were the strongest when my kids became the age I was sexually abused  yrs. I took parenting classes went to support groups therapy...to make sure I was aware amp how to be a healthier parent than mine.I think the key is validation of your experience amp pain. It is gracious for you to acknowledge your mothers trauma amp how it affected her as a parent amp person in general. I am hoping that you dont minimize what happened to you is all. All the pain you feel is valid amp needs to be healed amp resolved somehow.I was somewhat estranged from my mom for a long time. It would have helped with my healing a great deal if I could have talked to her about the sexual abuse I experienced. She had lived a traumatic life so it didnt happen too much. We are on general good enough but limited terms we live in different states. Bottom line I know she was devestated by what happened to me but didnt have the tools to help I heard alot of give it to Jesus amp forgive him. I actually did many many times...You are aware amp are being treated. You are on the right path. You are doing a good job.,survivorsofabuse,d03w7k0,1,t5_2t3ms

7441257,0,t3_4h3o0d,I can relate. Nowex was arrested after assaulting me causing partial hearing loss and brain trauma due to blunt injury. That was  months ago. Legal procedures are still ongoing but I struggle with feeling like there are consequences for your actions and I wish it didnt have to go down like this. Heres what I try to keep in mind. He had so many chances before it escalated to this. And he threw away every single one. If it hadnt been this time I couldnt have done it all right so that there wouldnt be another. There would always be another. I am not responsible for him. I am not his keeper. I can only help myself. I can simultaneously wish the best for someone and also believe that the best for them may be to face judgment and consequences. I can love the good times I had with him and love the good about him and feel disgust at what he did to me. Abusive relationships are complicated and too often I think I penalize myself for not feeling anything . Similarly I can have real issues with our criminal system and police and also believe that they were needed that night. Please PM me if you want to talk.,survivorsofabuse,d2o0uhp,1,t5_2t3ms
7535735,0,t1_d2yarg2,Perhaps putting it in the context of rape wasnt exactly right. Even if it wasnt rape it is abuse. If he was doing something to you sexually or otherwise that you did not like and you told him to stop thats abuse. That simple. Its a boundary that was crossed. I think saying your experience wasnt as bad as mine is like saying pancreatic cancer isnt as bad as brain cancer. All abuse is bad.And you have a right to talk about it here. This is for survivors of abuse in whatever form it takes. Also dont ever be afraid to voice your opinion. Even if its unpopular. Youre response isnt selfish. I honestly dont know why you feel like it is. At any rate please be safe.,survivorsofabuse,d2yrygs,3,t5_2t3ms

9183813,0,t3_55ouck,I hope you know how courageous of you it was to share your story on here.  Im sure it wasnt easy to recount all of that!  Abusive relationships can seem so straightforward on paper why didnt she leave him right away or how could she put up with that? but when you are living it momenttomoment there is a powerful inertia that locks you in and compels you to stay.Good news for you is youve got some critical survival instincts your danger antennae seem to be working ok.   You detected something sketchy early on.  The story about the motorcycles circling your car chilled me to the bone and I was so relieved that you had the wherewithal to flee the situation you kept your keys you stayed sober you got the hell out of there!.  Unfortunately after the fact this skilled manipulator tricked you into doubting your own instincts.   Next time you encounter this kind of parasite you will be more prepared to overcome his attempts at deception.  By the way if you could find your way to feeling compassionpity for this other girl I think it would help you to heal.  Your anger is better directed toward this abusive asshole.  Youre probably causing yourself a lot of undue stress by misdirecting your emotions toward this other woman.  Like KittehPuppeh said she is probably suffering just as you were.  Social media is nowhere close to a real representation of someones life.  One more thing Im sorry your friends arent being helpful to you.  You arent sending negative vibes.  You have had a crappy experience and it is very healthy of you to express it and attempt to process it with the input of understandingcaring people.  Personally I find it much worse dealing with people that have had some awful experiences they have shoved deep down and refuse to deal with.  It doesnt just go away unless you deal with it.       Thank you again for sharing your story.   You do deserve better.  Take care of yourself.,survivorsofabuse,d8g46ha,3,t5_2t3ms

Its kind of a game to see which friend is more wise and open to listen. You can sort of trickle information and see how they handle it to gauge if you can trust them.Im glad you got to share it though its tough to hang onto something like that when no one understands you. Youre welcome. This is the first step to acceptance. Hang in there!,survivorsofabuse,deqkw9m,1,t5_2t3ms
