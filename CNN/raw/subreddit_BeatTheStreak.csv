3687683,0,t1_cqcm22d,Fair point but Im of the mindset that most days there are about a dozen or more players that are good picks. In hindsight its much more  shit probably  players most days get a hit.I can acknowledge the drawback youre mentioning but this is an imperfect guessing game anyways and I really think the advantage of picking  vs.  is negligible  of the time.However lets say I get to  consecutive hits I might start getting real choosy and pick only .,BeatTheStreak,cqcmcgj,2,t5_31k6g

7714806,0,t1_d3j19ym,Compared to a  game hitting streak my first thought was ok big whoop. But an  game hitting streak under recent circumstances is actually pretty nice. And having discernment not to pick certain batters recently that didnt come through is actually quite an accomplishment. Seeing as how just a few days ago we had a handful of really good season long hitters just all lay eggs on the same day. I actually feel the same About Boston hitters. Im only on a  game hitting streak but I went away from Bogaerts which I originally had. Last night when looking at sneaky picks of hot batters who have good matchup and good career numbers I actually decided on Ian Desmond to keep it hot today and finally decided to jump back on the Altuve train today.
