7923272,0,t3_4np0qf,Thanks fort all the quality replies. I went for a bit of a rip early morning up the SeatoSky here in Vancouver and just ignored the k rpms and it was very smooth transitions so I just wound it out like any other bike and it was great. It was all in my head for sure. Im in Canada but Ill look up a replacement rear shock. I have no idea if the prev owners were large carrying large passengers or both  maybe the shock is bagged out anyway. The tires are Contimotion so Continentals budgetminded touring radial... so ya Im going to have to wear these out and get some proper Pilot Roads.And thanks for the tips on mufflersmods etc too I know theres loads of available parts thats part of why I love Honda in general  ok Im gonna go ride some more  thanks!,VFR,d46nfuw,1,t5_2z9rm
