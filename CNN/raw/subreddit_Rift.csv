542027,0,t1_cg15ir7,Rift is shockingly bad for large scale PvPand WFs compared to the joy of DAoC and WAR to a large extent. Hell my handle is still made up of my DAoC server Palomides. And we still play DAoC on live and free shards like Uthgard together old enemies now long time friends.On EU servers its one massive raid zergs from Bloodiron from what i can tell and there is only  of these zerg premades and  of the time whichever side gets them wins.In DAoCWAR it was a lot different you had the zerg from each realm and then you had your  man gank groups like ours who could go around and zerg bust. And because the gear pre ToA was essentially the same for a fresh  and an experienced oneRAs aside it came down to player ability and was the reason why our  man could destroy many times our number. In Rift it is a vastly different beast gear and PA makes an absolutely ludicrously big difference and with so many instant spells its basically if you have the gear just roll your face on the keyboard time. In DAoC for those who arent aware casters could not cast if they were under attack you HAD to position yourself and find space to operate none of this stand still mash keyboard like a retard of modern easy mechanic games. And few instant cast abilities and if they were insta cast they had a fraction of the powerduration of cast time ones. Melee abilities had positions you had to be in for them to work.,Rift,cg1vv5u,1,t5_2s4an

552916,0,t3_20djr1,Ive read through this thread and saw the frustration on both sides of the spectrum. After seeing the opinions of OP and RogueRaptor I tend to agree with RRs points. Before you point me out as another elitist asshole Id like to make a few points and explain this dynamic situation so that people can understand and perhaps find RogueRaptors a fair mindset to have.Point  At this point in the game being two raid tiers and multiple mini tiers of dungeonworld gear new or undergeared players should be expected to do their homework when joining group content with any kind of learning curve. Why? All of these dungeons except for RoTD have been out since the end of  so players who are geared or into raiding typically have already done all of these dungeons literally dozens of times each to acquire their raid currency. They know what to do now I bet half of them have an offhand dream about doing it in their sleep. At this point in the game they want to get it done and get the marks so they are closer to progressing through the highest tier of raid content you know the content that is actually relevant to them. Why should they after over a year of doing these dungeons still be expected to teach and carry every new player that joins their PuG? You could say out of kindness or patience but those arent objectively correct reasons and the reality is that most people dont want to login to play a game a game that they generally enjoy playing and spend a varying chunk of their playtime in that game teaching instead of playing. You could say that it only takes  extra minutes or that it is elitism that gets in the way of their patience and I disagree. Some new players that get into dungeons are much harder to teach and carry and you could end up spending half an hour or more just explaining mechanics and waiting for them to get it right after dying  times on each boss maybe! Most players just dont want to sit there and take that chance. Why should they? New players arent entitled to having random strangers hold their hand through low tiers of content. With ALL of this being said what I have described is what I will consider an absolute zero for newbie tolerance. I will move on to point  and add another dynamic to this pretty abrasive hypothetical standpoint.Point  There are a TON of informative resources available to new players that will help prepare them for dungeons and raids before they ever have to step foot in one. Are you a new guildless lone wolf that has never been to Golem Foundry and are thrown into that dungeon with a PuG with no patience? Take two minutes and do your homework! To add to what I first mentioned new players should be expected to do their homework for this stuff because it is EASY and painless. If you enjoy the game enough to invest time into playing the endgame content it would only make sense to to learn how the endgame content works. Even if you dont fully understand fights after reading seeing it in your first attempt will help clear things up. If you dont care to get some information yourself why should random strangers be expected to care about teaching you?Point  This is an MMO. By definition it is a social game with some content that can only be completed with multiple people. Literally. Try running into Frozen Tempest alone and see where that gets you. I think the game wont even let you in and then tell you that you need a group. What am I getting at here? FORM RELATIONSHIPS WITH PLAYERS. Guilds. Even utilize your friend list if you like to pretend that a guild isnt just a more complex friend list. In this game if you are ever in a situation where you feel like no one wants to invest any time into teaching you you are either in a PuG that doesnt care about you OPs main complaint it seems or you are in a guild that doesnt care about you. If you arent happy find a different guild. When it all comes down to it guilds are the single most invaluable tool that a new player will have at their disposal to learn play with people who have similar endgame goals raiding PvP dimensioneering etc. It is my personal opinion that the entire point of playing this game is to interact with a guild as almost all facets of content stem from those types of interactions. If your only reason for playing is to run around the open world alone this obviously does not apply to you. But if you have any desire to succeed in a group setting that WILL take effort on your part in finding a community of people within a guild that you mesh with. I hope this rd point sounds condescending and frustrating and thats because it is. Its like walking around in a new city. You can either walk around alone and clueless or you can help yourself just a tiny bit so that others will see that and want to help you too. And there is what Ive been boiling down to. YOU NEED TO HELP YOURSELF. You cant rightfully complain every time a queue takes forever because you can join a guild and ask for help in running them with guildies. You cant rightfully get pissed at strangers for not carrying you through a dungeon because you can look up information that will greatly escalate your chances of understanding said dungeon ahead of time.Im sorry if something doesnt make sense in this post because I got very tired in the middle of writing of it. Id probably do a better job of rebuttals if people replied with arguments to issues with my stances so that I may better clarify and get a good discussion going.TLDR  Newbies should help themselves before expecting help with dungeons because they will be a better and more likable player for doing so,Rift,cg34g5g,2,t5_2s4an

684570,1,t1_cghy6c0,Okay Ill bite.In other words youre complaining about PvP in a PvP map?  Looks like theres PvP in the PvE CQ after all.  The winning team gets to respawn after they die the other two teams do not.  Kill them PvP and forcerespawn them so they cant soul walk or get a rez.There are leaders that focus on PvP in Stillmoor CQ.  You can always solo gank people all game.  And Steppes CQ is still parsecs faster at increasing your kill count more PvP.  Also there are two chests in Steppes at the end so youre nearly guaranteed to be able to loot.Also also starting today you can start collecting fragments to eventually get a RIC.  Granted I think I saw itll take  weeks to get one but theres your guaranteed path.Als als if not getting some pixels made you log out for two days perhaps an attitude adjustment or a totally different genre of game would be better for you.  I suggest playing CQ because of the other rewards or because its fun and look at the chest at the end as a pleasant bonus.And back on topic PvP in this game is fun.  Everyones bolstered to a baseline but theres gear progression and even things a lowranked player can do to get a quick leg up.  Spec and skill are more important than gear. TTK is not  shots like FPS games.  You usually have escape options and almost never get stun locked.  Comebacks can and do happen. But apparently I have no idea what a real or good PvP system is and fun is not a valid adjective. Whatever try it yourself but at least read the level  PvP gearing guide first even if you dont put much time in so you dont walk in with unfilled gear slots.,Rift,cgi34r7,1,t5_2s4an

When certain Expert Dungeons such as Archive of Flesh and Golem Foundry are so overtuned that they result in people queuedodging or votekicking players below raid gear it means they are poorly balanced relative to their actual intended difficulty.Also the way stats and gearing work in Storm Legion is an absolute mess. As a tank for instance you have to rely on vanilla raid currency level  Empyrean Sourcestone loot to gear up for SL instances since quest drops are all suited for DPS and DPS only.From my own experience and from what I heard from others stacking Toughness as a tank in    instances is also moot because of how stat scaling works in said instances.That is poor game design.,Rift,cjfswqr,0,t5_2s4an

1894791,0,t3_2gbk7v,whether you have the addon packs or not the best overall healer is still a cleric setup for exactly what you need either solo healing or group healing.Ive been playing a dedicated healer thru my warrior with loads of points in Liberator and some in Paladin. Its OK for raids and warfronts but still has limitations. Theres no strong quick cast healing spells. Its mostly about slow group healing with the occasional power heal like from Ameliorate. If you wanna keep health bars topped off easily for  different people you cant even see its not bad at all. But for a  person dungeon crawl you cant heal individuals fast enough when they are getting pounded by a boss meaning it isnt the greatest dedicated healer.

2458094,0,t3_2nozai,Souls  You choose one class to start with Warrior Cleric etc and then have multiple specs after that for the various roles.  For example if you go Cleric you can heal with Purifier then change to Shaman for PvE before switching to Inquisitor for PvP. Each spec is made of  souls that contribute different attributes to the toon.  For healing you may choose to PurifierSentinelWarden to give you good healing castable shields and a good endurance level.  If you go damage you could look at InquisitorCabalistWarden for the high damage with good endurance. You can purchase multiple specs in game so you can run a healing damage support and tanking spec swapping as necessary.  I think the first one if around plat and I would recommend buying about  so that you can have one for PvE raids healing and a test one. One at the start is fine for leveling although by the time that you hit  you would want to have around  to  specs for testing specific roles etc. You can also respec your roles as well for plat from your class trainer so if youre unhappy with the current build you can always change it.Leveling You can do whatever you want in this.  Im currently running a cleric from  to  and its taken my about  weeks to get to .  Im a casual player so I dont play very often during the week plus Im doing this one as a more PvP oriented toon with gathering thrown in to make money. If you want to take time to quest and read up on the Lore it does go fairly deep and makes for interesting reading.  You can get into dungeons from about level  onwards so if youre concerned about bad habits start dungeons early and you should be fine by the time you hit endgame.,Rift,cmfitft,6,t5_2s4an

Especially when you get to  and you have SL gear and you are running  dungons.  I watched some videos since this post about purifier and it looks like a  button rotation will keep tank up but I will lose my k dps.  Which isnt much but its honestly more than most tanks and even some DPSSupp I have had.  Ill have to see for myself to know for sure.  May just keep the puri spec for when tank is undergeared or as you said not overgeared EDIT Comment on dps I average k dps while healing.  My dps specs cabalinq both average around k depending on pulls but have been as high as k.   extra DPS while healing is pretty significant.  Especially when most DPS average around k from what Ive seen.  Tanks usually push k as well.,Rift,corr0s3,1,t5_2s4an

3524541,0,t3_30lt6j,Everytime you press the button for your macro the macro starts and searches the first ability listed. Then it tries to cast that ability. If the ability can be cast the macro will just do that and stop.However if the first ability can not be cast out of rangeon CDon global CDetc. the macro searches for the next ability to cast.This way it is not possible to just put all your abilities into your macro and spam away because many abilities do not have a CD and can be cast as many times as you want. In that case the macro will only cast the first ability and then end. When its activated again right after the first time the first ability will just be cast again and the rest of the macro wont ever be touched.So you certainly can use macro to make your life a little bit easier but there are enough limitations so that it wont be a boring onebuttonspamfest. ,Rift,cpu0u3r,4,t5_2s4an
3537736,0,t3_30stpo,Hopefully somebody else can find you that list other than reading through the patchnotes which would be a pain. However heres the big stuff that I remember affecting me the most since I first started playing just after launch Theres a few new places to visit. A couple of the old zones got a few extras added and many of the zones have been reordered with their levels adjusted. Theres also a handful of new continents so the worlds a lot bigger. PVP souls were removed. Instead after level  you gain access to planar attunement a sort of second experience bar left over from when  was the level cap and you can start to stat towards PVP there. Dynamic world content is much improved. There are new types of rifts and zone events now plus things like Instant Adventure which warps you to a group and gives you random objectives to complete that balance themselves to your party size. There are even more currencies than before. Its not as much of a pain as it sounds though and some of the old currencies that took up inventory slots have been moved to the invisiblewallet type storage system that things like gold use. Collecting stuff has been embellished. From the next big patch youll even be able to collect the style of gear just by holding it in your inventory and apply it to your wardrobe slots. These styles are shared between characters. You can now collect minions. These are cards that can be used to play a mobilefacebook style game within Rift that earns you artifacts dimenion items Ill explain in a bit and crafting goods. Shards arent rigid anymore. Right click on your profile to temporarily warp to another shard without any penalties. Good for avoiding conflict on a PVP server or chasing specific events. As its now FP theres the usual stuff to be expected. Extra bag slots extra souls all of the old ones are still free the ability to wear earrings two new gear slots etc. However they havent really destroyed the feeling of the old pay to play game. Dimensions are a sort of playerhousing type thing. You can customize a sliver of the world to your liking. The keys for these dimensions can be found bought and even crafted. Youll also see the items that you can place in dimensions popping up in loot every now and then. Quests are much less hubbased than before. Youll find fewer quests in towns and villages and many more out in the world. It encourages exploration and as they can be handed in out in the field you dont need to keep running back and forth all the time. This becomes even more noticeable in the post level content. Theres a new type of PVP battleground type affair called conquest which is somewhere along the same lines as WoWs Alterac Valley. Chronicles are short twoman instances. Theyre usually snippets of bigger instances with the mobs adjusted to make them possible with two appropriately levelled characters.Im drawing a blank now but Im sure Ive missed some really important stuff. For example there have been changes to group and raid content but Ive always given that a miss as Im more of a fan of the open world dynamic stuff like chasing events and particular rifts. Its free though and as an old player youll get some rewards for paying back when the game cost money so why not give it a go?,Rift,cpviw2g,6,t5_2s4an

This wont mean that you can laugh at the mobs because you will have limited skills to use compared to higher level players but it means they cant laugh at you either.  And as someone else mentioned as long as someone in your group or I think raid has a faster mount you can take advantage of that because your mount speed will increase to match.  This came about because there used to be people that would still have just the  speed mount and be trying to keep up with those with  speed mounts just to try to hit on a rift.

They simply couldve moved on like gentleman and accepted that all is not fair in the world. Normally I would side with the company . of the time. Because usually they have legitimate reasons for their decisions.But this time? This time folks is the . of the time. Trion uses Live Testing to bypass the costs of an internal team. Trion uses money marketing schemes to generate revenue to fund this game. But at no point do they fund it in a way that would increase enjoyment of the game for the overall playerbase. They have not released a raid in Nightmare Tide that was finished. Let me repeat that. This entire expansion has seen unfinished content from RoF To Threngar to Crucia to Akylios to now MoM. Now not only have they mistakenly rushed content for the ever important bottom line. They have taken advantage of the passionate raiding community. Or the  as we might call it. They use them as testing dummies. And then scape goats if the community backlashes their poorly designed content. For example the backlash on Apoths Jino kill. Or the Coris death exploit. Or the trinket exploit used by FoH recently. These things should have NEVER seen the light of day beyond PTS. However since they use unpaid guilds and at best amateur testers. They often miss several bugs. Even ones that require bosses to be disabled for weeks at a time. And yet at no point has a Dev come out publicly and apologized for poorly designed content. No no.. They instead blame the testersVladd hello?Heres what baffles the mind. These Devs are professionals. They are being paid for their time and work. They are paid the same regardless of how content works or looks. And since a certain Dev loves comparisons lets do one to the Dev teams job well done for the entire expansion. In professional sports each player is required to deliver. A quarterback is expected to deliver more touchdowns than interceptions in a given season. If The Dev team were quarterbacks and the Nightmare Expansion a season. Then they would have thrown ZERO touchdowns. And multiple interceptions. Including the ever amazing BUTT FUMBLE once or twice. threngar hello? Do you think a QB with those stats would retain their job???? I didnt think so.,Rift,cyk4izv,4,t5_2s4an

6686815,0,t3_46j3pf,I downloaded Rift last night and had a similar issue to you  after beginning to play my computer just shut down. I turned it back on tried again and after  min it shut down again.I downloaded SpeedFan and saw that my Core and CPU temps were around C. I moved the tower from under the table back to the open room a bit and it went down to about C. Hoping that helps.  I suppose I could play with the cover removed if I had to but I dont think I want to do that. ,Rift,d0az42t,1,t5_2s4an

There are a LOT of areas Im willing to dog Trion for and performance used to be one of them but its gotten alot better with multicore and theyre still working on stuff like bit client so they get a bit of a break on that from me.,Rift,d3nd5v5,1,t5_2s4an

8511941,0,t1_d65f9ug,just be aware  levelling professtions that CRAFT stuff anything thats not gathering requires a LOT of investment upwards of k plat if you buy everything or several hours of farming.if you can manage THAT then by all means go aheadhowever if ur new i recommend dreamweaverrunecraft  mining  foraging.mining  foraging only require ish plat investment each and the items endgame sell fo  gold to  plat. they are STABLE sources of income dreamweaverrunecrafting is stableish too since EVERYONE requires the mats but they can be much more expensive to setup imho dreamweaver is the most expensive profession to levelup ,Rift,d65jt1y,1,t5_2s4an
