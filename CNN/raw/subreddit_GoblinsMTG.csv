5568111,0,t3_3reawk,Im skeptical on the contested war zone in the build.  There have been way too many times that a colorless mana wouldve been a real brick for me seeing my one forest in the opening hand means Im probably going to have a much rougher time.Im  on wether or not including the cavern of souls would be a good idea since I run a handful of spells that it would brick for and Im going fast enough that if they burn mana on countering my casts Im still going to be doing a pile of damage with the  other guys I can slide outHaving a mana come in tapped seems like way too much of a downside for how balls to the wall speedslammy Im trying to go.My Build,GoblinsMTG,cwn9wuz,2,t5_3a1nx

6153186,0,t1_cyotp1c,yea fanatic does work vs. memnite and inkmoth or even signal pest..lol this one turn the affinity guy attacked all out with like  guys including pest I had two mana up and cast Atarkas Command..guess what atarkas command gives my dudes? REACH lol totally didnt even see it coming..he had to read the card ,GoblinsMTG,cyp1xge,2,t5_3a1nx
6423347,0,t3_43noow,Goblin Chieftain and Goblin Rabblemaster play out a bit slower than the rest of the deck which can be problematic.  Im especially bearish on Rabblemaster as he forces you to suicide slam your team no matter what.  There have been enough times where Ive needed to strategically hold back to buy time to dig for the last  ounces of burn to close out the game and Rabbles makes that impossible.I prefer Mogg War Marshall over Dragon Fodder.  Gives you an extra trigger on FSD a possible chumper for the turn and a turn  great play with Goblin Grenade MWM Grenade MWM  mana turns into  damage and  tokens.Legion Loyalist is amazing and really screws up the math for the other guy.  If you drop him to run behind a Piledriver you create a giant first striketrampler.  Probably one of my favorite cards to see though that may also be because I have a random French foil of it that always makes me laugh when people try to read.For MonoRed there are definitely better artifact hate spells than Ancient Grudge.  In the monodeck its just a  mana kill spell that you get one use out of.  Id look into Shatterstorm as a replacement.  For two mana you get two kills but also have the flexibility to drop it for one.Guttural Response seems a bit narrow to me but I could be entirely wrong.Heres my current pile  Not quite what youre doing but always fun to share... plus my sideboard is still garbage posttwin ban,GoblinsMTG,czjplfe,1,t5_3a1nx

7242925,0,t1_d2160ms,Im actually playing a mono red version of your deck. Totally dig vexing devils haha.I wanted to start out mono colored and maybe transition into rg. What after you playing with now?  ,GoblinsMTG,d21guw8,1,t5_3a1nx
7308159,0,t1_d212oj7,man i just realized that krosan grip destroy enchantments also! i was sure it was only about artifact.. Pso splashing white its only about thalia imho and weartear even if very powerful isnt necessary. so i think ill try a list similar to your at first without adding white.have you tried to play a copy of wort boggart auntie instead of the second krenko?,GoblinsMTG,d28vz2w,1,t5_3a1nx
7415775,0,t1_d2l44jq,It was fun! Had some great draws and some duds. There were maybe  games where we were stuck on  land maybe Im supposed to not keep  landers. I want to add in token hate because tokens seem super popular and just the  loyalist werent enoughRecord on the night was . Lethal goblin grenade count was ,GoblinsMTG,d2l4j3a,2,t5_3a1nx
8315158,0,t1_d5gt6pb,Forked bolt is a burn spell. The upside is that it sometimes kills two blockers or that part of it isnt wasted on the one toughness creature you need to kill. Forked bolt is the card I want against mana dorks while electrickery is a card I want to be a board wipe. IMO the first forked is much more useful than the first electricity.,GoblinsMTG,d5gy94u,3,t5_3a1nx
10216208,0,t3_5mai6p, mana is still a lot for modern goblins but something feels good about this particular Threaten effect. If only the CMC  or less card you play could also have haste.,GoblinsMTG,dc22ce1,3,t5_3a1nx
