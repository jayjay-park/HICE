10092730,0,t3_5ka7wk,Nobunagas Attack is increased when its HP is increased.Crusader has more attack per missing HP.Saladin can turn scrolls to HP.So you max out HP which gives you defensive stats but it also enhances your attack.,GDmaze,dbn3kea,1,t5_3hr2f

10307657,0,t3_5fp79p,I would Add  tips . disable any completed gumballs on gold pot fragments page. Mercenary camp gt Golden pot gt faction gt filter fragments gt click on the tick to an x and the gumball will no longer be found inside golden pots. nothing hurts more then getting adventurer fragments from a gold pot.. You can revist sky instance with the captains journal with the finished tab at the bottom of the page. ,GDmaze,dccffoy,2,t5_3hr2f

10881396,0,t3_5vi2s4,Theres definitely a maximum because you can only have up to  artisans per resource.,GDmaze,de2c7ah,2,t5_3hr2f
10901204,0,t1_de4djh1,I actually think that you only need multiple PoE if youre aiming for the DP quests like maxing the dungeonspecific gear or companion. PoE and climbing back up takes too much time and the rewards for going  or  levels deeper arent really worth it. Id just die and start over.If youre really desperate though you can soullink Genie and wish for the magic carpet to go back  floors.,GDmaze,de4dr52,1,t5_3hr2f
10901277,0,t1_de4dr52,Fair point Using PoE already extends a run at least one minute per floor roughly.. I guess I need to just focus on farming and the airship which I just unlocked and power will creep up as I grind .,GDmaze,de4e0w2,1,t5_3hr2f
11008776,0,t1_ddzek2c,Yep! ,GDmaze,deftbea,1,t5_3hr2f
11093014,0,t3_5yelyk,Also the  thing you should do with Gems is unlock the New Mazes. They cost  gems each but the rewards are very high  every Maze gives you a Gumball on completion another Hidden Gumball potions a few gems for completing the base missions and if you can complete all of the quests you get  Golden Pots as well which is worth  gems by itself.,GDmaze,depdsww,3,t5_3hr2f
11131776,0,t1_detezd5,If you go the Files tab on the Facebook pageYoull find quite a bit of guides and helpful info for newer players ampnbspSo the rest of your questionsYes absolutely finish the storyline this will unlock you more gumball artisans for your workshop and more base gumballs to work with after the story work on getting  DP in some of the easier Mazes Adventurers Forest Village of Heroes Bloody Fortress and Draculas Castle were my first  finished and were quite easy with the right guide this is all my opinion of course.ampnbspPlanetary Fragment Maze for Zerg will only appear after exploration level  the actual chance of finding the maze is pure luck after that point the chance to find special events can be boosted with medals and some airships though.ampnbspFor the Nobu combo you generally always want to go Prophet first with Saladin main assuming its at least  stars and decently fed I find him too weak otherwise this gives you a ton more scrolls to disenchant especially if you find an elemental book and end up rolling in rank  scrolls and by the time you reach floor  again youll basically steamroll the boss.As for getting the Oracle suit Max level melee suit majority of the time assuming the maze has no way of reliably getting it you take Blacksmith max it first before disenchanting anything to get the most essence into Swordsmith to upgrade the melee suit to help this on the way so you dont run out of essences check every shop for ShadowDragonscaleOracle pieces to upgrade since youll have an abundance of EP after so many floors its better to spend it on gear rather than using up limited essences.ampnbspHope some of that rambling helps feel free to ask anything more specific if im not making sense. ,GDmaze,detrz0g,2,t5_3hr2f

11340907,0,t1_dfgtg6m,Hi! It should show an autocomplete drop down list. If the member isnt in it then they are not found. If the list itself isnt showing up then thats another issue!,GDmaze,dfhh07v,1,t5_3hr2f
11363532,0,t3_6252x4,You dont have to promote Zerg Queens star level for her to be good. You can just soul link her and let the summons destroy the early bosses.Once you start getting to the level  bosses you really need her fed ability to be level five. She can still be two star but feed her to level five ability. The high level bosses hit hard enough to kill the summons and fed level five ability makes the Zerg summons explode when they die. Combine the explosion with Disrupting Ray for crazy damage. This will let you clear the level  and  bosses needed to finish some of the s.You get the ability to feed to level five in Bloody Fortress in the second or third story mission.Edit also the sky instance dungeon with the Zerg Queen is called Planetary Fragment and it randomly shows up in sky exploration level .,GDmaze,dfk19eb,2,t5_3hr2f

11382389,0,t1_dfm25z4,this sky instance is not really for the reward but most likely the programmer wanted to do an rpglike thing in this game and they made this. difficultywise it isnt if you follow those guide though. Just need the adequate gumballs.,GDmaze,dfm6al8,2,t5_3hr2f
