8020817,0,t1_d4hkist,Watching videos of it makes me excited. I almost bought Fantasy Life because the selling price was really cheap but upon further research I learned that MH and FL might have an overlap on terms of how you play the game. Ill just buy FL at a much much later time.However I gave in and bought a cheap nd hand copy of FE Fates Birthright last weekend. Lol.,3DSPH,d4hm5so,3,t5_35bfu

8294975,0,t1_d5ee8ly,A visible woundmark will appear on a monsters body part if you hit it enough times. It may not be obvious at first due to all the movement but youll notice it. There seems to be some factors at play though toughness your weapon strength etc. but usually thats how it goes.Same here I need to slay a Great Maccau for a decent insect glaive build. The default IG is damn near useless against a Tetsucabra or monsters with tough skinarmorscales.,3DSPH,d5efii8,1,t5_35bfu
