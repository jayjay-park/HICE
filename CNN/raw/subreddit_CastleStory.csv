1280173,1,t1_cidmiyk,I think you should question your place within Sauropod. Youve essentially been replaced by Ben and youve essentially been downgraded to a paid forum moderator even though thats usually voluntary work.,CastleStory,cidmx9f,5,t5_2tb9e
1331942,0,t3_29b633,Cool in depth blog.Question whats up with the roadmap? Thierry himself said on the comments it should have been ready last wednesday yet no mention of it this week..edit for proof gtDidis days agogtHello and Welcome to Ben! I was just wondering when could we see the roadmap and the future plans for the game? like new stuffs or other news features gtThierry  days agogtHo I can answer that. the problem is only about fixing some bugs. We had someone in charge full time on this but he had too leave for personal reason.Its mainly some technical problems like some board not showing up and not conecting together and also our scrapper to get the data from trello is outdated and need to be fixed too. This week I was mostly showing Ben how the studio work and answers his questions but as you must have seen he wont need my help much from now on.Next week wednesday afterrnoon to be exact we meet someone to get the roadmap finished.We were once told it had to be populated by data then some other week it had to be updated and fixed furthermore. Which is it?,CastleStory,cijgku1,3,t5_2tb9e
1392687,0,t1_ciqtzsu,gtYou should be aware that some teams will be unable to finish their game. So you should only buy an Early Access game if you are excited about playing it in its current state.Steam lays it all out. While that doesnt apply to all early access stuff thats the general presumption of early access. gtpromise a good game  realease a buggy demo  charge full money for the demo  take they money and fucking run  how is this not illegal ?You said it yourself. They charged for the demo. If it was a preorder that would be different but in this case youve bought a beta to support development. ,CastleStory,ciqurlw,4,t5_2tb9e
1612267,0,t3_2cp63p,Heres what Sauropod needs to do.  Release monthly updates to the game.  This ties in with the three week sprints perfectly.  Use the vlog to show us the new work and tell us what they will be working on in the next month.Right now the roadmap lists one active task as Graphics  Concept Art  Bricktron.  Use the vlog to show us the concept art.  Update the changelog on the roadmap to indicate what was worked on.  Release the monthly patch with the new artwork in it.  Repeat for a few months and the toxic comments will be overwhelmed by all the positive comments.,CastleStory,cjie5tw,5,t5_2tb9e

1861662,0,t3_2fwjy5,It is simply this their PRCommunity ManagerWhateverheiscalled cant take the slightest amount of criticism and has become an excuse machine.  I am as frustrated as the next person that we were essentially lied to during the Kickstarter campaign and instead of handling it correctly that bozo became a mod for this subreddit and started banning people.  I wont rehash all of that but that become a tipping point for me.  I went from slightly annoyed never posting on this r to angry and disappointed.      People fup I fup its the way life is.  They fdup bad with this kickstarter.  There are always going to be critics even of the most dedicated and honest among us.  But if you mess up you own up to it say your sorry and you then dedicate your energy to making it right.  Instead they just continued to do the same crap creating more problems and pissing off more people.  Personally I feel they lack any sort of ethics integrity or common sense.      If they are a great organized efficient well managed company then the community manager should be fired because he reflects something which is the complete opposite.    If the community manager was really good at his job he would have a found a way to make things right to make folks like myself happy.  Its called Making Lemonade.  You take a problem and turn it into something good.  Hey we really pooched this release bad.  Please forgive us.  To make up for it here is a free copy of the game to give to a friend...whatever say your sorry a hundred times and give us a reason to cheer you on again!    I hope at the end of the day they produce a great solid product but theyve done exactly ZERO to prove to me that this will happen.  At the end of the day Ill never buy a product that any of those folks will ever produce again.  That is how much the community manager has angered me.,CastleStory,ckdiwnw,5,t5_2tb9e
1867324,0,t1_cke5aa7,I think this is the point where I become more critical of Sauropod.I dont think this is OKMaking mistakes and reigning in scope creep and all the other trappings of developing a project are pretty normal day to day stuff.The point where I draw the line is when these people simly dont learn from their mistakes and make the same mistakes over and over adinfinium.This is this point where issues stop being the result inexperience and starts being the result of incompetence.Inexperience and incompetence are two totally seperate things in my view.Incompetence is someone who is inexperienced and refuses to learn no matter how many opportunities to learn and grow they are given.At this stage  years down the line and over  in their pockets I cant see any reason to view Sauropod as anything except totally and irreversibly incompetent.Which is a shame because I and many others would enjoy playing a propperly completed version of Castle Story.,CastleStory,cke7fya,2,t5_2tb9e

2346353,0,t3_2m607f,UPDATE Ben has via Steam presented that I am wrong about them choosing to abandon the reddit because of gamergate.As the gamergate thing was a big topic of discussion between myself and Thierry around the same time and there is that bit of a language barrier I am more than willing to believe I misunderstood and relayed gamergate as a reason for their leaving.  The reason Ben provides namely that it seemed every time interaction happened it only made things worse stands as the only other reason.I recall that being said as well but apparently my attention was drawn back to a gamergate conversation Thierry and myself were having along side that one and I screwed up my causes.  Thats my bad guys.  Again this isnt agreement or anything else just a reason and now that its been mentioned by Ben safely assumed to be the official reason.I just wanted to pop back in with that after I saw it pointed out.,CastleStory,cm1pycd,5,t5_2tb9e

Fixed by closing other steam applications CSGO Hammer SDKCurrently they wont move unless I tell them exactly what to do. Had this issue before. If I create a job before stockpiles the AI freeze up after gathering even if I cancel and reassign them. They can still wander around if I tell them but they wont perform jobs.Here I walked them right up to a job and they still stood idle even with logs ready to collect.  Edit  Its hard to convey with screenshots but they havent moved in half a daynight cycle except the  feet or so I told them to.    Double Edit  Building a stockpile first fixes this but annoying to do so.,CastleStory,cn0fafx,2,t5_2tb9e

3770641,0,t1_cqm2ho4,I really feel youre getting the wrong message from my posts. Im not asking you to thank them and Im not saying this one feature makes the game good on its own. Im asking you what your reason is for being negative about the game becoming what it should be. Not why youre negative about the game overall just about the subject of this thread. Is it just an expression of frustration? I mean I can understand that but wouldnt the arrival of an objectively good feature ease that frustration somewhat? Its literally the game moving away from the reason youre unhappy with it.,CastleStory,cqm2x0r,2,t5_2tb9e
6664306,0,t3_46xjc4,First you need to set up wooden beams about  blocks away from each other. Then you set down wooden beams in between. Then at the top you pick the wooden wedges or the wooden piece where it looks like a center piece of a roof if you look out from the front of a house. Put that on the wooden beam.Then finally you connect to that piece with an incline.Let me know if you still need help and Ill try to make a GIF showing how its done.,CastleStory,d08nago,3,t5_2tb9e

7590845,0,t3_4jahjx,Hello everyone for this weeks livestream breakdown. Todays livestream presents Shatojon and EvaxQA pitting themselves together in a Invasion custom map from the beginning to the end to survive as long as possible. This custom map is created and designed by Shatojon.Both Shatojon and EvaxQA agreed to collaborate together by dividing up the tasks in the game. One player manages the resources while the other manages buildings and combat.This breakdown is posted at a later time because the analysis of the livestream is more taskintensive than usual. Also its because I have just graduated!Normal Stuffs.    Boldface Important stuffs.     Capture card issues at the start of the stream caused repeated clicking noises. Good thing this is temporary.     Shatojon explained this livestream is used to facilitate playtesting while allowing the viewers to see unstable gameplay.      EvaxQA briefly described Invasion mode as Bragging Mode to show bragging rights to others.     Shatojon implied custom maps will be shared on Steam Workshop.     Shatojon also disclaimed any bugs you see in the livestream may not represent the final gameplay.     For the first map run EvaxQA did the construction and blueprints Shatojon does the resources. They are the Red Team Faction.     EvaxQA assessed Shatojons map and gives insights to the design aesthetics of the map.     Shatojon explained there arent any rewards for surviving waves or a certain number of waves in Invasion at the moment. But tweeting a screenshot of your wave counts exposes you to more likes!     Controls Hold down SHIFT to place down Stockpiles in a row.      There are no ETAs on the updates. For demos you can have Steam account sharing to allow your friends to try out the game.    Theres no way to try the game before you buy it legally.     Shatojon explained the big red crystals are red because they are the Red Team.     Shatojon answered if  players are on the same team you cannot choose different colors. If you want to play with shared controls you need to be in the same color. In the future the server will force the color upon the client so the client will not be able to choose colors.     EvaxQA reminded everyone theres fog of war in the game but the fogo of war is not apparent to the players.      EvaxQA mentioned the blue stamina bar of the Bricktron Warriors are for blocking. They need to have some stamina in order to block attacks.      Shatojon explained if a Bricktron completes a task the Bricktron unassigns the completed task from itself and the task then gets deleted all done automatically.      At this exact moment of time EvaxQA showed two new icons that the player can construct A drawbridge and a bridge. The drawbridge icon shows water in the trench while the bridge icon shows a wooden archway spanning across two islands. The drawbridge icon implies there will be water in the game but this is unconfirmed at the moment.      Shatojon had to kill off a Bricktron worker that has gotten itself inactive broken. Either that or EvaxQA knew about this bug already.     Shatojon mentioned players who posted negative reviews havent played hasnt come back to play the latest version Castle Story and encouraged them to come and try the game again especially when the update is released.     EvaxQA reminded Shatojon the combat hasnt changed since v..     Shatojon explained if you hover your mouse over a construction item that is in progress it will show a pinklight purple progression blueprint of the task and how much resources it still need for it to be complete.     Shatojon was mistaken about coop conquest its already in the game. PvP Conquest will be a thing in the next update.     Due to EvaxQA underestimating Wave  for the first run Shatojon and EvaxQA lost this round.      Shatojon decides he will do construction and combat and EvaxQA will do resources management.      And no I am not going to mention Shatojons acnes on his forehead. Just the fact that hes  years older than me is surprising.  ltlt      EvaxQA mentioned the Taskbar now has numbers which you and your partners can easily tell if you need more Bricktrons for the construction tasks.      Mines now have been tweaked! Allows up to  Bricktron workers to mine in mines now.      Bricktrons can now walk across empty Stockpiles confirmed!      EvaxQA mentioned a sneak peek but hes not telling. He may be mentioning how Bricktrons are now able to go underneath a voxel high gap between the stairs and the brick hanging low from above. Or he is referring to the archway bridge that players can possibly build in the future. Also Ive noticed if you box select the unselected blueprints it will turn pink. Possible sneakpeek feature may include the ability for players to actually box select blueprints to quickly deletecopypaste them allinonego? Well see...         Shatojon said they wanted to do vs PVP livestream but they wanted to make sure the game is stable for it to work.      I reminded EvaxQA the idea of having a portable headlight that Bricktrons can bring while venturing at night. EvaxQA confirmed this is not yet planned but the idea is still intriguing.      At this exact timestamp the Bricktron worker now responds to replenished resources more responsively. A.I. improvements confirmed!      The shapes in the Taskbar are as follows              Square Warriors        Diamond Archers        Circle Workers  Unfortunately Shatojon didnt notice theres a Bricktron worker just idling in the corner of the building.      EvaxQA confirmed the door can heal itself. Im not sure if its because of a quirk in development or its because the door is placed near the big crystal as implied by Shatojon.      Shatojon confirms the door healing itself is a temporary measure in the game development.     Also during this timestamp Shatojon keeps referring the souls flying around the big crystal as Fireflies. Souls are nicknamed officially as Fireflies.  ltlt     EvaxQA showed wooden braces will automatically be attached to wooden beams when you extend the beams from wooden poles.     Shatojon describes playing with the Wood System is like learning how to ride a bicycle.     Lanterns are used to illuminate Corruptrons in the invisible fog of war.      Bricktron workers carrying bricks can now jump up  voxel high ledgesbrick walls and jump down. No need to build thick walls to accomodate the workers to walk to them.      Shatojon claimed he will shave his beard live on the stream. Audio is muddy but he did say he will shave.        EvaxQAs dog keeps licking Shatojons elbow... Tasty...      Majority of the viewers in Twitch voted to extend the livestream for an extra wave.      Game now shows the Test Spawn feature. This is a development build therefore Test Spawn will appear.      JokieW typed in Chinese... !. Not sure why...     In the chat people are saying they were either stalking the development of Castle Story or havent played Castle Story in a long time. Hopefully there will be more players playing when the next update comes out.      JokieW confirmed about Credit Island and that he will not have his little stone in that map.      Shatojon revealed he reads my posts every Saturday morning with a cup of coffee.     Taskbar now shows how much health a Bricktron has. Shapes in the Taskbar colored from orange to red represents that Bricktron health is medium to low.      Ending the stream with a blast!       Dont forget about Ask the Devs! session thats about to end next Wednesday!      EvaxQA confirmed you can tell your Archers to shoot at barrels to explode them from a distance and showed off how it is done.    See you all next week!,CastleStory,d351ibp,2,t5_2tb9e
