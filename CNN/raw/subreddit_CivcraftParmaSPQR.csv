5870403,0,t1_cxp24j1,We had to move the chests. I actually just removed them all because it will be a lot easier to put in the stairstorches youll see after the obsidian is in.Edit You can see where the obsidian is dug out for the walls floor and ceiling. Once its in Ill put the chests and everything together.Edit  If you dont want to put the obsidian in you can leave it in a chest and Ill do it. I found some in one of them. I assume were just doing SRO?,CivcraftParmaSPQR,cxp53br,1,t5_3b2qe
