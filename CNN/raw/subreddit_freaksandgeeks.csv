7880285,0,t3_4mgji4,I think it ended perfectly. It cements that Lindsay has decided to take a different path from the one she was put on. She grew up and changed and shes happy. The whole series is a story about different characters growing up and the challenges they face along the way. Its beautiful and it made me sad when I reflected on that fact that I dont know what path Im going to take from where I am in my life. I guess thats normal. But Im scared.,freaksandgeeks,d41tfuo,9,t5_2s44v

I can still relate to the characters even though Im a bit order than them. P.S. I have a crush on Lindsey like I havent had on anyone else ever. ,freaksandgeeks,dc9k6q8,1,t5_2s44v
