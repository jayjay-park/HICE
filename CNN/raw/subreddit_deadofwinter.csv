9121600,0,t3_50qi6z,I cant remember reading the rules about the icons. Do the rules say that the number one item there is the most likely to find? And they become less likely to find as it descends?or could it be that the icons position just indicates this is a decent place to get it.i.e For arguments sake. Lets say there were only  guns in the whole game and they were at the police station. I could understand the developers putting the gun symbol high in queue on the police station because it is your BEST chance of getting a gun and doesnt actually indicate that youre more likely to get a gun than anything pictured below it.,deadofwinter,d889msu,1,t5_32eoc
9254478,0,t3_570327,The way we play it from memory Yep  zombie per survivor and then roll a dice for each noise created  is a zombie  no zombie. . Spending an unused action die to attract zombies on your turn I think its  zombies from any location to a location where one of your survivors is at. We havent come across anything other than weapons and searching that creates noise but some cards might have you putting noise down but they would be pretty self explanatory. . One player can fill up all the noise spots at a location. Once all the noise spots are used up you stop searching. You look at all the cards in your hand from the search and choose one sometimes more than one if your ability allows it.. Nope incorrect. If a location is full you can leave it. You can also move to a location that is full of zombies but you or someone else would have to kill some of them or else the overrun would come at the end of the round and you would die given that you cant move the same survivor more than once per round. . Nope incorrect. Search all you like but just keep track of how many zombiessurvivors you share the location with and how much noise was generated there to try figure out if it will be overrun during the add zombies part of the colony phase. . Pretty sure its only the Sniper Rifle that can do this. Otherwise you need to be at the location where you want to kill the zombie. . Theres a really clear diagram in the rule book of this but basically youre adding zombies one at a time in an anticlockwise direction follow the numbers. So if the colony has no zombies but you need to add  you would put one at each numbered location then the th zombie would be put at the second spot of number  entrance. Its over run when you try to add a zombie to a spot that isnt available. . Yep barricades are one use only. So if you try to add a zombie as normal but there is a barricade on the spot where the zombie should go you take away the barricade and dont add the zombie. . Eating food from the colony doesnt require an action dice. You consume one food token to reroll one of your unused die. You could do this for all of your dice but its a dick move and you would be drawing attention to yourself. . You can call for a vote to exile at any point during your turn. The first player guy with the knife splits any ties. This is all just from memory so someone else might be able to clear some of these up if Ive made a boo boo. Like the others have mentioned after youve played a game or two reread the rules and they will be a lot clearer. Amazing game hope this helps ,deadofwinter,d8p2lbt,0,t5_32eoc
