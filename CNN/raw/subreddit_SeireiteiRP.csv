2757623,0,t1_cnhibno,Ichirou remains focused on the dummy scowling at it. Of course one wouldnt be able to tell under the goggles and mask over his mouth.After another few swings he gets fed up and kicks the dummy. Fucking bullshit dummy...,SeireiteiRP,cnhj481,1,t5_31kx7
2860976,0,t1_cns9vds,Reis scythe quickly took the leading claw off the creature as it lunged. It gave a howl of pain but had no way of stopping the momentum of its lunge. It caught the reverse end of the scythe clean in the center of the chest and the resulting implosion caused its howls of pain to go silent. It fell forward dead just in time for the second hollow to leap over it leading with a large closed fist trying to bat the shinigami into the wall beside her the close quarters of the forge allowing it to do so.,SeireiteiRP,cntalze,1,t5_31kx7
2890105,0,t1_cnwl9kq,Anya flips back onto her feet and returns the gesture by shaking Malcolms hand.Well I could give you a motivational speech about you shouldnt give up and if you keep trying youll succeed but youre not a little kid so Im not even gonna try that bullshit.She laughs to herself a little.Have you tried looking at the target. I mean like...She thinks for a moment. Closes one eye staring at the target for a second she then says the inaction for hado . Weak it did virtually no damage to the target but it still hit the target. She then stepped back.Sounds stupid but it works.,SeireiteiRP,cnwlwty,1,t5_31kx7
2941289,0,t1_co2fdv5,Group could be fun lemme know who else signs up. Id prefer to be grouped with someone that Malcolm has at least interacted with before,SeireiteiRP,co2frea,1,t5_31kx7

3008847,0,t1_co9kiq6,Hm. Complete disregard for ones own safety even in the face of danger. Attention to authority. Ignorance to scientific research.The man wasted no time in continuing to ramble on completely ignoring almost everything Aiku had to say. He swings what turned out to just be a normal metal rod around and placing it on the ground like a cane looks like his earlier threat was quite empty and reliant on the fact that Aiku couldnt see it at the time which turned out to be an utter failure.Alright Mr Boohoohata of the Boohoohata family. Ill let you help me but dont think for a second that youve earned my trust. Everything you said is something a spy would say its how you act however that give it away. Spies are far more suave.Without giving time for a rebuttal and complete ignorance to the pronunciation of Aikus name he turns on his heel and shuffles over to the beakers that were once filled with a black ooze and dumped the pink slime into a trash disposal mumbling disgruntlement the entire time.Anyway I dont have much time to waste I need you to pick me up some flowers.He leans over a nearby desk covered in papers his nose inches away from the surface and scans over them. The way he looks and acts combined with the sheer thickness of his glasses must mean that the man is indeed poor sighted if not partially blind.Well A flower specifically. Very rare and very valuable. Well valuable to me. Not something that could be sold on the black market or anything... not that youd do that since youre not a spy and probably dont even know where the black market is.He slams his finger on a small picture in a Ah ha! sort of fashion and picks it off the table holding it out to Aiku slightly off center giving further evidence to his poor eyesightThis is a photograph of a Frost Lotus I need you to get me one. The actual flower not another photograph. Its used as a preservative and I need it for a healing salve Im working on.Turning back around bumping into a table corner as he does the man scours over the table again finally picking up a large map and pulling a small clear canister out of his coat.Heres where you can probably most likely maybe find one. And use this containment unit to transport it as touching the lotus may give you a mild case of serious frost bite in the general region of your entire body. Just hold the opening over top of it and it should suck it up. He leans in close to Aikus face speaking quietlyI developed it myself.ANYWAYHe shouts the last bit leaning back and clapping his hands.That flower isnt going to get itself now off you go! Unless you have any menial questions you have to ask. Im certain that I explained everything quite clearly but Ill humor you for your sake.The map points far to the north in what looks like a mountain region far outside the Seireitei. A crude drawing of a cave is on the map where the mountains are with a note saying big cave cant miss watch for spies. along with another crude drawing in the corner of the map which looks like a stick man touching a flower with a big cross through it. Another reminder not to touch the Lotus.,SeireiteiRP,co9v4zv,1,t5_31kx7
3046693,0,t1_codpy90,The gears begin turning in Hotarus head as she starts to think about the situation and what she can do about it.Well these books might be a little lengthy and some of them will definitely be medical volumes and things like that...If you want I could read the books and write up a research paper for you...A brief summery of all the information you need to know! I can have it ready for you tomorrow but it will cost you! She says with a wink.,SeireiteiRP,codsevh,1,t5_31kx7
3093832,0,t1_cof987x,Listening to Char as he told her about all the people who had visited she smiles at him when he finishes and asks about her equipment she shrugs immediately followed by her wincing.I assumed they checked it when they gave it to me in the prep. Maybe it was the hollow itself but weve never been told about any Hollow like that that could hide its strength. Im only lucky they dont send us out on training missions alone.Looking down at her shoulder she moves her arm around to try and get rid of the ache.Did they say how bad my injuries were? Or what happened after I passed out?,SeireiteiRP,coioaae,1,t5_31kx7
3115773,0,t3_2vta0d,Walking into the cafe carrying some a few books Hotaru approaches the front counter and places the volumes on the table before the manager.Ah! Miss Tachibana! Thank you so much for delivering these books! We really wanted to branch out our brew methods and this is exactly what we wanted! Hotaru gives a small bow and the manager hands her a small bag of coins.Thank you so much sir! I am glad I could have helped! If you need anything else copied just let me know!Of course! Before you go! Id like to pay for your lunch! The owner reaches over to the counter and pulls out a cup of coffee and a slice of cake. Hotaru stares at the cake for a moment...drool forms on her lips and she wipes it away.Thank you....so much....delicious carbs... She takes her tray of food and turns around she sees a familiar face sitting at one of the tables.Oh! Buruhantasan! How are you? May I join you? Hotaru gives a smile and waits for a response.,SeireiteiRP,coky6p1,1,t5_31kx7
3177156,0,t1_coqe2l2,If I may ask what drove you to become a Shinigami? What Ive read in the books is that your clan are against all sorts of war. The life of a Shinigami is full of combat and death.We have books written about us? He laughs softly. Everything about him seems to be soft his voice the gentle inviting look in his eyes that spoke of no malice everything. He was growing to like Raiki more and more the blue haired man seemed to be very kind and he could certainly hold a conversation up.Well I do have my reasons. He says as he starts to walk. Assuming that Raiki walked with him he would have continued speaking. Above all the Yukimura value peace. Joining the Shinigami may seem hypocritical because of that He glances at him his smile polite. but seeing as the eradication of Hollows brings peace its one of the few times we will willingly fight. I hope that answers it. He continues to walk along in silence for a few seconds enjoying the sights and sounds.And what made you join the Gotei  then?,SeireiteiRP,corb7fk,1,t5_31kx7
3234804,0,t1_cow5piu,As Aisaka stepped out onto the ice she slipped a little but caught herself with the assistance of the girl it didnt take a great deal of time to get to the plant while she was not great on the ice her new friend seemed quite comfortable walking across the frozen surface as they reached the plant she took a moment to admire it up closeThat was quite impressive I though it was going to be an ice bridge instead you froze the entire fucking lake thats pretty cool.Any youve helped me out a great deal and we still havent introduced ourselves Im Aisaka Eto it was a pleasure and a lot of luck that a I met you.While she made idle chitchat Aisaka had pulled length of cloth from her pocket and wrapped it around her hand effectivly insulting her hand and giving her thr ability to grasp the plant after being warned about the plant she didnt feel like taking unnecessary risksTaking out a pocket knife she cut one of the stems with a few of the plants flowers connected to it should be a big enough sample for the crazy scientistCould I get a hand back to shore I still have about as much balance on ice as bambi...,SeireiteiRP,coxal29,1,t5_31kx7
3254411,0,t1_coza13s,A Military Operation run as a social club. And Zero Division didnt even provide a free bar.The honest truth was that Tokuji didnt really know where he would fit into all of this. At present the Seireitei was mainly just chaos except for the occasional order and mission passed down from the Zero Division. But otherwise anyone could do whatever they wanted. And as messed up as it was Tokuji actually enjoyed it. But it would probably soon come to an end when people began to take charge and cliques began to form. It did present a lot of opportunities though.It could all go horribly wrong. Too many people could try and direct everyone else factions form and then BAM! Civil War. Worst case scenario sure but the Seireitei could be burning by the time we get back. Well at least it would end the night in fireworks.With that comment the food arrived at the table. The waitress carefully place down the two bowls of Nikujaga before bowing refilling Ries drink and wishing them a pleasant meal. Though the food looked basic it smelled remarkable wellseasoned. Tokuji knew the dishes here would be very basic but it was basic done phenomenally well. He took another sip from his drink before digging into the main course. It certainly looked like it would be a filling meal.I get the feeling that you are too ambitious to let this chance escape from your grasp. Incoherence rules the Seireitei at present. So tell me how are going to use this to your advantage? Its a good opportunity for you to take some kind of authoritative position after all. What are you going to do?,SeireiteiRP,cozbw5h,1,t5_31kx7
3321681,0,t1_cp26kye,Izumi hadnt really noticed anything exceptionally about this man whod just come striding forward. Hed just been another face in the crowd until he strode forward pushing slightly to get towards the front of the queue forming in front of her. When he spoke she cringed a little noting the intentionally obnoxious volume of his voice and the sheer inappropriateness of his question. She stared at him coldly with nothing to say for about five full seconds. The crowd around them had gone quiet waiting to see how this exchange would play out. Izumi wasnt going to stand for any of this shit though and her response seemed to freeze the air around her.As with all respectable Squads there will be no behaviour of that nature tolerated in my squad. If you even need to ask that question then perhaps this squad isnt for you.Who are you?She added the last part rather rudely. She sounded firm and serious otherwise and did her best to keep her tone confident and even. She didnt want to look as though she didnt have control of the situation and she did a damn good job of not losing her cool aside from the last question. ,SeireiteiRP,cp6werj,1,t5_31kx7
3341955,0,t1_cp8r52n,He laughed at her facial response. That was hilarious! Nevertheless he shook his head to indicate that he was just kidding. He then listened to her explanation that she tested it on herself. He could just continue messing with her but he could just test the drink for himself. He took the drink from her and popped it open and swigging it back. Holy hell this worked like XTC. He got a quick burst of energy as the Kido almost subconciously formed in his hand again he was a little overloaded. Excuse me.. he said to her before standing up and locating a free dummy and firing a burst of five Byakurai at the dummy. I was overloading my reiatsu. Anyway your little potion works its magic thanks!,SeireiteiRP,cp97hg5,1,t5_31kx7
3484459,0,t1_cpowpvt,Hotaru puffs her chest out and takes a swig of water. She is obviously proud of her increased exploration of the human world but she is far from an expert she has only been twice as well...Oh yeah! I go over there all the time! I have been trying to set up a lab with some of their computers and things like that! Its funny humans cant use kido or manipulate reishi but their hardware can be converted so easily converted to run off it! They have these things called smart phones that use towers to bounce signals and messages off of but I am thinking I could modify them to use reiatsu instead as a beacon! This is again...early in development but I think we could really do some cool stuff!as my oc said this is just stuff I am thinking of doing I am good IRL friends with the Renneta Neo and we were talking about bringing his Mirror Mirror app to the Seireitei. Just talking nothing worth noting.,SeireiteiRP,cppgbyn,1,t5_31kx7
3532908,0,t1_cpuetks,Theres no such thing as overconfidence. Arrogance isnt a bad trait either. Sometimes believing in yourself even when you have no advantage can become your advantage. Ive seen fights decided by confidence alone its an extreme factor. If you dont believe youll win hell if you dont believe youll survive you might as well gut yourself before your opponent does...Cezar kept fidgeting in his bag until finally he got a handful of yellow powder. He turned around walking back to the shrine that was dedicated to his long lost friend. He still acknowledged Tokujis presense.I see the world a different way than most. The first thing I do when I look at someone is size up their strength. Theres signs beyond physical such as where they are or how they sound the emotions they carry. Anybody with a brain knows that this aint a safe area those kids excluded because they are young. If ya gonna wander out here in the outskirts ya got to have some fighting skills. So there is that. You where a Shuhakisho you have a Zanpakuto. You stay back and watch me fight hollows then approach a stranger who was capable of battle joking with them about their fight. I aint the only one confident bub. Them are signs of confidence as well. You stand tall confident. You talk like a kind guy but what you say shows confidence. Youre in hostile territory yet you seem in a chipper mood. Yea youre just as confident as me. If not more so.Cezar sprinkled the powder around the shrine letting it sink in to the cracks of the rocks. It fell into the dirt and the grass. It let off an aroma of garlic revealing to be a garlicpowder blend. You always liked garlic you weirdo... Thought C.After I size up my opponents strength I try to decide how long it would take for either them or me to win in combat and how much damage I could take and deliver. Thats always a wildcard because who knows the truth behind that.,SeireiteiRP,cpuz4mg,1,t5_31kx7
3714703,0,t1_cqf9ucq,Hmm? Important? Private?Ai takes a brief glance down at the note decides that its not his business to read and hands it to Hotaru. She seemed to be pretty panicked that it wasnt in her possession after all.I guess that I wouldnt care to know what it says then. My names Ai and Im new around here. Really know actually I was actually just going to find a dormitory to stay in.Sorry for how short this is I didnt have much time to write.,SeireiteiRP,cqfpagg,1,t5_31kx7

3799528,0,t3_33wrws,Ash yawned lightly as he stepped out from the bar his current assistant Yuki following behind him hounding the young captain. The black haired woman adjusted her glasses shuffling a few papers as the duo walked a look of annoyance on her face.Karyutaichou do you not understand that you have a lot of paperwork to catch up on? You dont have time to be running around to bars!Now now. Ash said calmly sipping at a flask that he had hidden inside of his Shihakusho. My division was started inside of a bar like this one call it... recruiting if you want to justify it.He took a few more steps before he noticed Tokuji running down one of the side alleys men following behind him. Ash cocked his head to the side a small grin on his face. Maybe tonight would be more interesting than he had thought.Yukichan you never learned shunpo did you? Ash asked grinding his back foot into the ground slightly.No I didnt. Why is that rele In a flash of movement Ash was gone headed to the rooftops to follow behind Tokuji. He wouldnt get involved if a fight started after all it was the mans decision to start an altercation he could solve the problem himself.When the black haired Shinigami had finally escaped Ash Shunpod a few feet away from him the force of the step causing his captains haori to blow slightly behind him.So.. He started scratching at the back of his head. Is this something Im going to have to do paperwork for or did you just sleep with one  of their wives?,SeireiteiRP,cqpdjhy,1,t5_31kx7
4323904,0,t1_cscnqo5,She puts a hand on her hip and looks at him quizzically having heard his little slip of the tongue. Luckily she doesnt seem to pay it too much mind.Oh that mightve been me... Sanzunokawa thats my Zanpakuto keeps her blade cold no matter what. Comes in handy on days like this. The light mightve reflected into your eyes sorry about that...She rubs the back of her head and shrugs apologetically before moving on to explaining what she was doing there.Well I was assigned to patrol this part of the Seireitei today. Im usually lucky enough to get a morning patrol in the Rukon but not today I suppose. What about you? What has you wandering around?,SeireiteiRP,csd16xz,1,t5_31kx7
