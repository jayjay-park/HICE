But today an overwhelming number of people are developing homosexual tendencies due to the shit that is put in front of their eyes as they are growing up.Also lets define the term mental illness shall we? Mental illness is any disease or condition that influences the way a person thinks feels behaves andor relates to others and to his or her surroundings.  Mental disorders are generally defined by a combination of how a person feels acts thinks or perceives  Pathology any of various disorders in which a persons thoughts emotions or behaviour are so abnormal as to cause suffering to himself herself or other people Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions  disorders that affect your mood thinking and behavior.Gender dysphoria fits perfectly into it therefore it is a mental illness whether people choose to call it one or not.

5125828,0,t1_cuzkbze,I think you are misunderstanding how reddit works.reddit claims at least to support free nonharassing speech while simultaneously giving mods control over their subs.This means that if you want to create a sub called rcopslivesmatter or ralllivesmatter or rblacklivesmatterbutthatdoesntmeantheygetodefyoffcops reddit will give you that space.  You as a mod  can choose whether BLM supporters can post stuff you disagree with or whether you want an echo chamber.   If you opt for the echo chamber someone else can come along and create a sub for debate on the subject.  That seems pretty pro free speech to me.There are too damn many subs for the admins to moderate.  And I can tell you that if the admins came in and moderated the content in my sub for nonexceptional reasons unlike say harassment suicidal users child porn etc Id be gone in a hurry.A sub to me is a lot like a club with an open mike.  It will suck if people dont come but if youre the one who opened to club and advertised it if you want to say No Country Music I think you should have that right.I would add that I dont agree with banning a user without notifying them as to why and providing an appeal system.  But then again I dont know how daunting it is to deal with the volume of a default sub.,Upvoted,cv3urxx,1,t5_2r77i

5273245,0,t1_cvl5rrd,This program is very different from the ones you have mentioned. Id say the main difference is that the students in the program I mentioned are the ones responsible for generating any and all income via fundraising and most of our time was spent either traveling to fundraisers fundraising itself or in the shop creating the merchandise we needed to create a more legitimate fundraising facade. If a person couldnt stand outside of Walmart for  hours no matter what the weather no matter if they had physical disabilities that made standing painful or uncomfortable no matter if it was  degrees outside to  degrees with wind blowing  miles an hour you HAD to fundraise. Talking to my sisters in the program the most traumatic thing we had to do was fundraise. Its hard to describe how bad it really is. One of my closest friends caught staphylococcus on her perirectal area she had a massive painful boil on her private areas and it was only after multiple requests to go to the emergency room was she eventually allowed to go after the smell became apparent outside of her clothes. They did not allow any medicine for the pain and her screams from the doctors office made everyone in the waiting room extremely uncomfortable. The doctor prescribed bed rest but the next day was a fundraiser. She had to fundraise bottom line.     I am not trying to villainize Christianity in this piece. Any reasonable person wouldnt lump this style of Christianity in with all of the others. ,Upvoted,cvlpt30,2,t5_2r77i

5483233,0,t3_3okgp6,You experience culture shock if you move anywhere. Even within the United States I have yet to move to a different state or even area without some degree of culture shock. My best example is moving from California to Florida. While there is still some element of American culture that is similar like large stores and reliable running water everything else was totally different. From homeless people to the way people treat one another. People in California are materialistic in some degree but in Florida it is so much more prevalent that I was at first repulsed by it. In California people look past race in casual interactions while in Florida people stick to their group be it various Hispanic groups to East Coast Jews. Even Southern whites wont interact with whites from the north. I spent a lot of time in Canada and frankly it was less shocking than spending time in Texas. Culture is a local creation with some national influences but mostly the result of the communitys experiences and history. Immigrants and internal migrants will experience it as part of moving. It is not brave or perplexing to deal with else all the millions of Italian immigrants would have never assimilated in the United States. Adapting to the culture you move to is social survival not more heroic than eating so you dont die of starvation. You will of course bring your culture with you but you either synchronize the two or become a hermit. Let the trolling begin. ,Upvoted,cwcj8gn,2,t5_2r77i
5502308,0,t1_cwe8a5b,No problem. One issue I have is with the assertion that people are lazy so when they do things by hand it becomes simpler.The correct history is. etchings and imprintings that are imperfect due to crude human tools. type chiseled into stone requiring things like serifs to make edges cleaner these are geometrically simple compared to  and more laborious. script hand drawn again back to imperfect because they are hand done. typography back to perfect machines let us be simple againSo really when you look at futura it takes a lot more skill to render that type than it does to make less geometrically precise type aka your own handwriting. Even with a calligraphic pen youd have to essentially fill in some of the strokes or lines that you draw rather than render that type with a few strokes. this is because the machines make the letterforms legible without requiring  of strokes or doing any sort of measuring. So even though futura is simpler it is harder to craft it with a pen than it would be to craft a flourished script.Aside from blackletter scripts and handwritten fonts main goal is forming the words without lifting your pen to speed up the writing process.Even blackletter pays attention to it but at the cost of legibility.Of course talented artists may be able to render geometric fonts as rapidly as they could render highly intricate calligraphy but writing simple words takes remarkably longer if trying to attain geometric precision.,Upvoted,cweyz8f,2,t5_2r77i
