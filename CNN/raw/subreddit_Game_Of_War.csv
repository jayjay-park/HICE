Now you need to spend a few hundred just to be able to play.   mil?   Thatll be zeroed in  minutes now.   There is a fundamental issue with game balance.   You need to spend to play and you need to keep spending to survive.    ,Game_Of_War,cutt7kp,2,t5_32smn

8784469,0,t1_d73prkm,Wow crazy awesome you got the full imperial dragon set. So tell me if you have that why are you bothering with the Xena defense set? Or am I going bonkers and mixing the sets up? Id probably cry a little bit if I got a super good pack offered to me because I swore I wouldnt spend another dollar and Im trying so hard to get out. I didnt even buy to get the banners so that thing is jumping up and down at me all the dingdang time.When I talked about my kingdom being a mess I was not kidding. We just had our biggest two or three alliances leave the kingdom. Basically it seems like the only people left are assholes people who cant drop  for an advanced kingdom teleport and people who are loyal for whatever reason to one of the two former categories. Im B and C combined. My alliance has been gutted but I feel too loyal to my current alliance leader to leave her and all this time the only reason Ive continued playing the game is those people. So its this weird space Im in  I could ditch the really great people who are left but most of them are either not big spenders and thus will never be competitive or they have a lot of RL stuff at the moment. And I dont even know what alliance Id join if I were to ditch them. Our wonder is basically abandoned most of the time now. Its so bad.Im not sure what on earth is a healthy replacement tbh. I tried gardening and I love it but thats one of those things where its like... well ok I did all the fun parts where I built a garden. Its very pretty. Theres some stuff left to do of course as the seasons change but winter is coming lol and thats definitely a lull. Also heh gardening is not much cheaper than mobile games. At least its more socially acceptable to spend money on. P My last addiction was to a MUSH which was at least free. Sometimes I consider trying to go back to that but its way easier to put down a tablet whenever you want vs the social commitments of a scene. Anyway... good times I guess. Glad to hear youre having fun with it now though! D ,Game_Of_War,d73qc0m,1,t5_32smn
