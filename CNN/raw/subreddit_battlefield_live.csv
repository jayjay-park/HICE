Also p CQ with less flags would be needed..Rush is really unpopular at the moment reasons areonly  players should be minimum P because tanks are domination on certain maps. Also some rush map design needs tweaking can you bring Rush more popular again? Also many players are complaining that all servers are same not enough varietly. So we need and we are missing proper mixed mode servers that gives boost to gaming as it did in BF. Reason is because of this locked player counts By mode.

10607919,0,t3_5rs4kb,This clip perfectly illustrates why I think this is the same issue as black smoking choppers in BF. It looks alike its a disagreement between where your client is showing the visual model and where the server thinks the vehicle is. Essentially the grenade hits the vehicle on the client send the hit to the server the server rejects it because the vehicle is not there so the grenade does not instantly explode just bounces. Ive never had this happen on a stationary vehicle.In your video your grenade bounces of the top edge of the truck which immediately starts moving forward. But because of all the latencies involved that truck actually started moving ms ago moving forward enough that your grenade would have sailed over the top so the server rejects the hit and you just get a client side bounce.,battlefield_live,dda4iys,7,t5_3hht5

10852990,0,t3_5ut6x9,Looking at the Art Of Battlefield  book they had some really cool designs and customisation could really go well with BF clothes and equipment modification could be awesome to bring into the game I think even if its a simple customisation element itd be well worth doing and not only would satisfy the people who want customisation but the people who want more unlockables and content not all of the designs seemed suitable due to silhouettes and colour schemes as they pointed out themselves in the book so its easily identifiable as to which country they belong to  but I really think they missed a trick by not including it in the final game maybe slight variables in heads like battlefront some facial hair variants or equipment and clothing choices or different stages of weathering. Im sure it would be a fair bit of work but perhaps with the CTE and everyone expressing their views they may take notice and chose to do so and I for one would be happy if they did.also the Art Of Battlefield  book is awesome for anyone interested its got some great designs that show the development of the game and is well worth checking out if you like BF,battlefield_live,ddzeqk0,3,t5_3hht5
10854654,0,t3_5v2g1n,I am on the ropes. I kind of thought that flamethrower is meh for elite class standards for a while but I changed my mind once I played more with it and made adjustments not being damaged by your own fire in full game kind of helped a lot too. In the end my performance improved a lot once I started prefiring and flaming corners and stairways with incendiaries before getting to them. Also it requires putting way more thought into positioning than Sentries or even TH. Issues with bayonet charges? Do your best to stick close to corners you can hide behind as much as possible.

Also there is too many AAs on Empires Edgethere is like   A flag B flag E flag F flag x around G flag  x around D flag I would remove the ones from around D flag as AA from BF and E can cover that airspace easily.Here is the map of all AA guns and what space they can cover on  Empires Edge map,battlefield_live,de0n83q,1,t5_3hht5
10865597,0,t1_de0mmhd,gt One assault player throwing all  AT grenades at a heavy tank about  seconds will do around  damage or more. I regularly see this argument and I dont see it happening against decent tankers that at all times keep stretches of distance between them and the infantry. Mostly they even keep out of HE mortar range. Meaning Kbullets and AT rifle are the only common threats to them. With the repairantics and spotsystems in the game they are hardly a threat. Assault infantry trying to close the gap to flank and kill it are easily picked off with the splash or laser acurate driver MG and extremely flexible and easy rd POV that lets you see behind all forms of cover. This problem arose since the open beta and DICE neglected it. DICE over casualized the tankgameplay in this game and its hurting the game. ,battlefield_live,de0pjii,2,t5_3hht5

They wont offer a different type of gameplay just another  clip bolt action rifle.What is the point of having so many weapons for each class? It will be a nightmare to get the balancing right while still offering a different experience. I really dont get why people constantly complain about the lack of weapons. There are quite a few distinct weapons for each class and more are added in the DLC. Currently the weapons are balanced quite well there are no weapons which are too powerful compared to their class alternatives. And there is no class that can win the game by itself like the assault class in previous games. Why cant you play the game out of sheer enjoyment why is it necessary to get rewarded for spending your time on a game? Even if they add a few more guns after a month you will start crying there is nothing else to unlock.

10958391,0,t1_dea94gv,The HE Crossbow is great for disabling weapons on the heavy tank and armored train and is pretty effective with knocking out the tracks on a landship as well.I dont think it was meant to be a Support class version of the Assaults AT Rocket since that would end up diminishing the role of Assault as the primary AntiArmor kit.I like to think of the HE Crossbow as the Supports version of the K Bullets given to Scouts. The K Bullets arent there to make Scouts able to solo a tank. Their main use is to interrupt repairs and get disables on weakspots  weapons tracks engine etc from long or short range.The Crossbow happens to be very good at those exact things too.

I dont think that means saying no to specific solutions if they work or doing exactly what seemed to work in the past. We need to find a way for this game in this time that makes sense and still reaches the gameplay improvements across the board we are looking for. I think for instance that a majority of players not playing the teamplay game simply dont see the fun in it  I think that is one part to attack. Being in a teamplaying squad that works together is one of the best feelings on the battlefield  what we need is help eveyone play more like that in general and in specific situations. There is no magic bullet here IMO  loads of small but impactful changes to balance the game and how we communicate it will do the trick. Especially the comms part is key IMO  I think we can change lots of behaviour of players in lemming mode by adjusting these things and add new focused missions in game suggested by Chris amp also something Ive personally wanted in some form since BF inception but never got to.,battlefield_live,dedulty,4,t5_3hht5

Players have to wait long for any changes to happen. Too long in FPSgameland.DICE refuses to pick up serious balance issues with the vehicles. Both tanks and airplanes.

As of now you are physically incapable of spamming as many explosives under the autoregen system than you were under the previous system.

The only issue with BFs implementation of ammo as a whole was grenades could be resupplied from ammo pouches extremely fast with no penalty to movement. This was something that was changed from the previous game and was the wrong change.They just needed to revert that change or make a heavy modification to it such as limiting pouch grenade resupply time to around the current autoregen times and the system would be back to no problems.There are things within this that could be added to benefit the old system such as suppression affecting resupply from crates and potentially the overcharge feature which could be limited to ammo crates to make more of a choice between ammo crates or pouches,battlefield_live,df3u49e,3,t5_3hht5
11223909,0,t1_df4795u,gtWell then what would be the role of the medic guns?

11231635,0,t1_df52eex,The difference between getting ammo back faster amp getting ammo back slower if the difference between constantly playing aggressively and constantly playing conservatively. Its very similar to the current medic dynamic. You can sit amp wait for health regen to take place over maybe s or you can get healed by a medic amp set off towards the next objective in no time. The player who is supported by a medic in that scenario is going to have an undeniably greater impact on the round than the one who isnt.Also have you ever gone up against a heavy tank with an outside repper in this game? Theyre basically fucking invincible. Like take  direct hits in a row and are still on  health when they kill you levels of invincible.

11240676,0,t3_60aw8p,Just to clarify with ammo . we wont always have grenades. Well just get them back more consistently without a support player.I still hate the idea of ammo . completely though. If you use your grenades or gadgets you should REQUIRE a support player. Otherwise they should change the command in the commorose from NEED AMMO to NEED FASTER AMMO COOLDOWN.When it comes to the upcoming changes to resupplying gadgets I think DICE is overlooking an important aspect to gameplay. Situational urgency. Players dont usually need a steady consistent flow of ammo. They often need a surplus of ammo to deal with a specific situation at a moments notice. Sometimes a clutch resupply of an assault player can be the difference between life and death when battling a tank. In that situation you need the gadget ammo immediately. Sitting on a crate for  seconds while a tank is after you will usually spell certain death. But when that situation is over the assault player should be forced to use a support player to resupply to be ready for the next engagement.,battlefield_live,df644gq,2,t5_3hht5

I already play support the most because I run out of ammo quickly with Assault. I just dont have faith in the player base enough for them to actually do their job. On the other hand Im not a fan of magic ammo and grenades appearing after a certain amount of time it actually benefits players like me too. While I do try and find a support guy they usually dont drop ammo... I get annoyed and pick up an enemy or friendly kit and improvise. I see nothing wrong with that. I just pick up a dead support kit and drop myself ammo and switch guns entirely. ,battlefield_live,df6mthh,7,t5_3hht5

11277417,0,t3_60x38b,This is what I have been thinking about as well for the past few days. It was in BFMC and Bad Company  and I thought it worked great in those games. It gets rid of the grenade spam caused by support player ammo drops and autoreplenishing grenades.   It makes grenades a more valuable resource because people have to fall back and actively take themselves out of combat to get a grenade. No longer is it statistically worth it to instantly chuck grenades right when you spawn.  Its much simpler than the current ammo .. Casuals can understand it and quite frankly people like myself who have been playing this series for over a decade can also understand it. I think these universal crates should also resupply up to  ammo for each gadget. Support still has a role especially on the frontline where the action is taking place but players also dont get frustrated trying to get support players to drop ammo. It will still be more beneficial for the team to have support players drop ammo because assault players will get rocket gun ammo much quicker that they can put to good use immediately.,battlefield_live,dfaa1q1,2,t5_3hht5
11278393,0,t1_df9s5o5,It was to fix more then grenade and explosive spam and does.  Why is Assault less effective against vehicles?

In my opinion if you forced them to deal with it you would see plenty are capable of doing so when needed and would learn how to play that way and over some period of time grow to like it as was the case in games years ago. However it is obvious DICE is directing these games to be as accessible as possible to reach a broader audience though claiming not to so a different game mode for players like myself would at least be a compromise.

Behemoths grenades and bayonets are AIDS but the guns are largely fine. gtpeople are sooo obsesed about balance that they forget about funAnd whats so fun about imbalanced gunplay? Lets go back to the MA orgy that was BF! gteven less customization than in bf BF effectively has more customization than BF. In BF if you wanted an optimally performing weapon you often only had one choice of attachment combinations. For example if you want a good AEK you use compstubby and pretty much nothing else. A few weapons had  or  good attachment combinations but even there there still existed one superior combination of attachments. In BF you are guaranteed three optimally performing attachment combinations for pretty much every weapon. Why should freedom for a worse weapon be a thing if weapon balance is a goal? After all imbalanced gunplay isnt fun. BF also has effectively more weapon variety than BF despite having less options. The differences between the various  rpm ARs are smaller than the differences between even the various Mondragon variants for example. Theres effectively no difference between the  rpm ARs in terms of play style while the three MP variants play extremely differently. How differently do the various BF bolt actions play?

Not matter what please keep in mind that it is a damn tank. Like a big motorised armoured vehicle with a canon that shoots explosive rounds. If that thing isnt powerful or scary then I dont know what could be.There is a difference between being scary and being largely unbalanced for all the wrong reasons.Like a big armored self repairing vehicle that drives relatively fast sees everything with an all seeing eye in the sky including in and behind cover...and has large splash with ammo that magically regenerates. Nothing new there though. Its ok. But dynamite limpets AT nades? Never reaches good tankers. And dont forget the never reloading autocannon on the flanker tank. It. Never. Pauses. You must really hate infantry on vehicle conquest maps. And the AT rifle? Does less damage than BFs weakest AT option the MBTLAW. And that has no drop higher reload and much less risk to use. But WAIT AT rifle ricochets often if tank is on a slope or moving! HOW AWESOME IS THAT.Whilst BF tanks received increased killfarm ability on medium to long range.

11554289,0,t3_64wts9,Once again you cannot compare bf grenades to bf grenades. The reason why bf system isnt in bf is simply because it will not work for a multitude of reasons. For instance in bf you had one size fit all weapons due to gunplay mechanics. You could out sniper snipers with smgs meaning you never had to worry about closing any kind of distance gap to be effective with your weapon. Meaning any weapon could be effective at any range in any situation. In Bf you cannot do this because of the way the gunplay is set up. You cant out sniper a sniper with an automatico and every weapon class has a dominant range. The assaults dominate at close range why would any other class but assaults try to attack a position given the assaults dominance with rpm hip firing automaticos and ohk shotguns plus the cap zones being incredibly small and devoid of any cover? This is where the grenade becomes the great equalizer to this problem. If maps were larger and more spread out like Sinai Empires Edge St Quentin Scar the grenade problem is far less of an actual issue just like in bf where the maps were larger spread out a bit more and the cap zones were larger and filled with more cover. I think grenades as they work in the CTE right now are very good. It requires teamwork to get them back but you arent punished for living more than  seconds.,battlefield_live,dg5oksb,3,t5_3hht5
11562356,0,t3_5vnf45,I totally agree I believe there is a lot of people bitching about maps and stuff but this one Ive actually had a lot of real problems with and I agree with your points and I think its something that needs to be addressed.,battlefield_live,dg6lj3m,1,t5_3hht5
11565425,0,t3_65108i,Just an anecdotal thing but has anyone seen a more vile chat? Online games have always been full of peoples bullshit but it feels like BFs chat is always filled with slurs and all sorts of shit. I feel like it has something to do with the presence of Germany in the game and the polarization of the United States in the wake of the election.,battlefield_live,dg6y2lc,1,t5_3hht5
11568663,0,t1_dg7b969,Either I was to stupid to realize it or on the wrong side gonna have a look for myself thx for that info ,battlefield_live,dg7baom,1,t5_3hht5
11569265,0,t1_dg77i79,That this the thing  and Auto  are good short range SLR also SLR are quicker to aim and kill than LMG so it makes it easier for a Medic to defend themselves switching from wrench to weapon. Which is the point a Support jumping out of a tank to repair needs more time to take out an attacking Assault than what a Medic would.A Medic can repair both injured vehicles and team mates at the same time. Drop a health kit would see to that. If you are talking revive then it is a tough choice revive infantry or repair a team spawn point.  Even a medic with Rifle HE Grenade and Light AntiTank Grenade is not stronger than Support with HE Mortar.,battlefield_live,dg7dr5g,1,t5_3hht5
11589046,0,t3_6560uj,IMO the one who dealt the most damage to the behemoth should get the kills and the  points no matter who dealt the last damage. Currently it doesnt motivate people to damage the behemoth at all before its nearly destroyed.,battlefield_live,dg9mjgf,1,t5_3hht5
11599423,0,t3_65jr5s,Ive made a few posts and comments as to how this map would fit really well in the upcoming Turning Tides DLC. However with the recent announcement of a free standalone map Nivelle Nights I figured Id repost this to hopefully inspire some of the Devs!ampnbsp The Battle of Tanga would offer a lot in terms of gameplay amphibious landing trenches dense forestfoliage and a small town.ampnbsp  This map would be a pleasant change with sandy beaches and palm trees and would be a unique setting in a rather unexplored theater of war. ampnbsp DICE wouldnt have to worry about adding a new faction we already have the British and Germans!ampnbsp Just take a look at the map layout! It looks like it was already made for the game!TLDRIf DICE Devs plan on adding free standalone maps Premiumexclusive or not then I think the Battle of Tanga would offer a lot in the form of fun interesting gameplay and a unique setting.,battlefield_live,dgasxdj,8,t5_3hht5
11602806,0,t1_dgb2nov,They fixed the netcode grenade spam balanced weapons so it made sense a low rate of fire weapon should be more viable at range than a high rate of fire one added some of the most unique maps and weapons to the whole Battlefield  roster. I think they did a mighty fine job for just being given a mess of game to deal with. I get that they missed some areas but they got a lot done. AA balance was messed up from the beginning with DICE Stockholms addition of passive air missiles I dont think their solely to blame. They did way more good than bad and I think they should be praised for it. ,battlefield_live,dgb6r5z,18,t5_3hht5
11625661,0,t1_dgdqapd,I read through this exchange a couple of times and I struggle to see anything besides a simple You had rotten luck I did not case without some hidden meaning. I know that the amount of snarkiness and personal jabs in game communities in general are pretty high to put it nicely and can result in feeling suspicious about intent of the other poster hell I have to be very careful to keep that mindset in check myself there is no shame in feeling that as long as we dont act on it but this time it simply isnt the case so lets try not to search for negativity that simply isnt there shall we? I really doubt that it would result in anything besides rolling into rulebreaking territory as tempers flare. Do we all need or want that? I really dont think so.post edited a couple of times due to typos,battlefield_live,dgds43f,2,t5_3hht5
11638248,0,t1_dgezmyg,Well... I didnt exactly push for it although I did include it in some feedback I Lanky and a few others sent to some of the devs.Although I think that being able to choose your own colors just like you can choose your own colors for hit markers should be a feature in the game.I may not be colorblind but I still use the tritanopia setting as its colors are more clear in a way.EDIT I recommend this website ,battlefield_live,dgf7ils,4,t5_3hht5
11672615,0,t3_66k61x,That what in place now.A passive timer that once it reach  you can get a grenade for a crate instantly. ,battlefield_live,dgj3v74,4,t5_3hht5
11679391,0,t1_dgjcruy,Haha! Good morning. Went straight to bed after replying yesterday.  A slider is a good way to give the player the full control over his experience. Some people play Battlefield for its intense and immersion and I believe most players will actually not change it.I would almost go so far and say slider for everything where it makes sense. Giving the player a lot of options to customise and personalise his gameplay experience plays a big role in Battlefield if you ask me and always has. ,battlefield_live,dgjvj6t,14,t5_3hht5
11723340,0,t3_679qh7,Will never happen. One of the main reasons I spend very little time playing BF and most of my time in Overwatch is because a dev recently in this subreddit told me I should enjoy the gameplay primarily. I enjoy the gameplay in overwatch but wouldnt play it if it didnt have all that ranking comp etc... I guess thats exactly the process Im going through with BF now boredom and disinterest. Its a casual game and op neither you nor me are the target audience anymore. ,battlefield_live,dgovcy3,5,t5_3hht5
11730611,0,t1_dgp5rc6,Idk I kind of prefer it how it is. In BF I could look across the map not even ADS just spotting everywhere finding guys I couldnt even see. Seems kind of cheesy to locate an enemy that you technically couldnt spot with your own eyes. ,battlefield_live,dgpp1ef,2,t5_3hht5
11739155,0,t1_dgqnmjc,Please calm down. I have removed posts for violation of Rule . Disagreeing is fine but please do it in a constructive way instead of resorting to personal attacks.,battlefield_live,dgqnvv7,1,t5_3hht5
11741171,0,t1_dgokbvh,yet they never relied on RNG in the other BF titles that had microtransactions and still made money off them. Keep in mind these are all just pixels. It literally costs them NOTHING to offer them for sale while giving them out for for completing a task or doing well. Anything they make off the sales is pure profit anyway. Id say let what you unlock still rely on a dice roll and that will be enough to incentivise the microtransactions.As it is now you get many duplicates and if MTs were the main push behind this why not offer legendary and superior packs for sale instead of the plain jane packs? Id much rather buy say  superior for what  plain packs cost. At least then you are guaranteed something decent. ,battlefield_live,dgqw3xa,1,t5_3hht5
11748306,0,t1_dgrn2jf,When I have a Party of  People which are all  then of cource we have more high ranks. It wozld be garbage if the game would split us up.,battlefield_live,dgrp7bm,1,t5_3hht5

11766316,0,t3_67rmxz,Please bring it back as I stated in another comment requesting it Domination is too fast and Conquest large is too hectic at least imo. Please DICE.,battlefield_live,dgtqqbh,2,t5_3hht5
11768508,0,t1_dgtz1u7,It is unplayable for us with high ping. Just look at the comments here.    Ive been playing in SEA region in BF and now HK servers in BF. We did not really get a lot of hates from the locals for having high pings we actually made a lot of friends. So I dont really get where you have the ideas high ping players made the locals unplayable.    After the patch I cant even get any hit registration shooting at enemies less than m FACE TO FACE. It is not about lead to compensate. It is a serious netcode issue here.    Also just for your information some chinese players get ms ping connecting to HK servers due to geography. They are locals and they also got punished for playing in own region.    ,battlefield_live,dgtzox3,9,t5_3hht5
11773447,0,t1_dgujq9x,Haha!  OK  thats a second known about bug.  Its supposed to return you to the warmup session if the number of players drops to a certain threshold.  That number is currently ...  So it doesnt return you to the warmup session.  Next patch should have that number set to .  So if only  people remain while its counting down itll kick back to the warm up session allowing you to mess around while waiting to get back up to .,battlefield_live,dgujyic,1,t5_3hht5

11785981,0,t3_67yr08,How being faster and able to drop shot lowers the skill gap?Its quite the opposite actually.Theres all this trash talk about cod playstile which is senseless comparing the esport side of the two gamesbf is more casual than cod by farnot only for gameplay reasonstanks and planes require more  than a player to kill themtheyre available till the start rather than being earned in combat but also because of bf limitation in gunplaysuch as random spreadsuppression rather than a damage model made to create effective ranges without punishing the accurate playerlike R for example.In shortgameplay is way more important than realism.,battlefield_live,dgvzala,0,t5_3hht5
11790386,0,t1_dgvolx3,No the low health colorwash actually cuts out alot of the color of the gas. You can only just barely make it out at low health.,battlefield_live,dgwhael,1,t5_3hht5

11805613,0,t1_dgy6s9v,I meant variants not the amount of weapons. We never get to play with the Springfield infantry or the BARM low weight. The variant system restricts me from playing with these weapons the way I want to. ,battlefield_live,dgy7goe,1,t5_3hht5
