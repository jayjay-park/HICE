3042676,0,t1_cocxgw4,Lemme think... Depending on the size of the venue Id shoot for like  or  hours in advance? I showed up to the first show like  minutes before it started but there was a big merch stand and shit so lots of people got distracted and I got to the front anyway. Plus that venue was pretty small.The second venue was a lot bigger there. I showed up there around  or pm iirc and the show was at  completely going off of memory here its been a while. I was in the middle for the two opening acts but just slowly edged my way to the front and I was right against the stage in time for NMH. If you dont want to like be aggressive and stuff then Id shoot for at least  hours early unless the venue is particularly small.,neutralmilkhotel,coddf53,1,t5_2ro9f

7484823,0,t3_4hw99m,Some others and I talked about it before here Im almost  sure its fake the names of some of the instrumental songs on this recording were decided by the original revealer of the tape on nmh.org who said he guessed names like we breathe skin every day oh baby strawberry etc based on the lyrics of those songs. Unless the original guy was lying and made up the names himself these tracks are not from Beauty because they have no lyrics to be named after.This and other issues like the high production quality compared to tapes before and after it the same pedal effect throughout the entire tape something jeff never did etc. make me believe someone made this up for fun and forgot a few key details.,neutralmilkhotel,d2szenk,4,t5_2ro9f
