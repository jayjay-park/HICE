6383419,0,t1_czf4y1y,Wondering this same thing. Im thinking they mean staggers because I went around breaking his crystals for a while and never saw them drop anything. Also there are other drops on the list that mention breaking parts of bosses that have no actual extra target spawning. Going to go farm the  ramuh once or twice and see if I can get him to give one up. Will report back.Update  tries on  Quest Bolt of Surging Fury.  No dice on Shattered Levin. Still getting the same drops from staggerbreaks that he gave from lower star quests.

6396000,0,t3_438w14,This is something I first noticed on my monk usimg vacuum wave. If you start the animation and change targets when you teleport as part of the animation it will go to your target so as long as you change targets before the hit occurs you will move to whatever you targeted last. A nice way to warp out of the way on certain bosses. Dryad for example if you change to a monster or vine you can warp out of breath range or warp away from her burrowing attack. ,FinalFantasyExplorers,czgnr0f,3,t5_3599n

Ive unlocked all jobs except SAM and PLD and thats because like in all games I like saving my materials. Its loads of fun to solo with a few monster companions and what little Ive played online is cool minus the FPS drops on occassion.While not the best game Ive ever played Id love it if this game could get a sequel that fleshed everything out just abit more.

Using it as MH Lite is just additional lemonade from the lemons presented at endgame. If you have any friends that couldnt get into monster hunter due to difficulty point them here and have them revisit once theres nowhere else to go in this heh.

6652727,0,t3_46ocrq,Just my  cents Ive almost finished my late game sammy build and I got rid of all healingsupport spells because the snowstormnether mooncherry blossom combo is all you need for support.  All three of those skills can get hp absorb and ap absorb mutations.  nether mooncherry blossom also have ap absorb built into the ability.  Link them and the three ability combo is faster than auto attacking three times it should also easily restore  of your hp depending on crits and at least one should crit if you have decent crit.  If you use this combo with effective mutations absorb  links then you can ditch the accessory and go for Artefact  str crit rate crit power restore function which will greatly increase your damage. Also if you arent using Peerless Illusion you are just missing out.  So much fun to be had with that ability!,FinalFantasyExplorers,d07g6zl,1,t5_3599n

If you want you can also put a few points of Link Puncture to CDG and do a DD gt Puncture gt Merc Thrust gtTrue Thrust gt Moulin gt CDG gt Puncture gt Merc gt TT gt Moulin  link combo... since the cd of the  skills are fast and it is doable if you timed it correctly. However I doubt you can stand around for this long to do such a long combo....Keep having removing buff on some skills to remove rage or any defensive buffs.Heal is for floating and buffing..... And occasionally healing but I find I use it to gain buffs a lot more often... Other use is to circle Surges as a heal with  pets inside the circle can refresh it most times.Against some more damaging enemies will advise to go for the  hit combo Merc gt TT gt Moulin gtCDG and keep DD and Puncture for dodging purposes thus the Instant CD on both of them.As you can see I didnt have Jump inside my build... I dont know where to fit it as it cannot link and doesnt do anything my DDpuncture cannot already do.EDIT I have since changed my skill build... still experimenting and will update once I am done,FinalFantasyExplorers,d0hjqlg,1,t5_3599n

6874323,0,t1_d0uwymz, Crit Rate  gives you  crit  more damage. I dont know what base crit power is. I think its  could be . Crit Power  gives you  more damage on Crits. So if you had  Crit it gives you  more damage. Since you will never have  crit outside of Critical Star dont use gear with Crit Power. Gear with Crit rate is pretty bad too but for other reasons low max caps.Check this google doc for the stat caps Basically gear with negative stats have higher caps and end up being much stronger than other weapons.,FinalFantasyExplorers,d0vin5g,1,t5_3599n

7146856,0,t3_47nrlx,So I was thinking about making a few changes on the build. Mainly I wanted to squeeze in Chant du Cygne because then you are able to loop all of your offensive abilities like this Sneak Attack gt Trick Attack gt Blade Dance gt Mirage Dive gt Mistral gt Chant du Cygne gt Sneak Attack repeatAlso by the time you go through the full combo Sneak Attack and Trick Attack always come off cooldown. If you space the combo out a little bit you can get Blade Dance to come off CD too. The extra damage of Chant du Cygne could possibly get pretty ridiculous. I am not sure which mutations to use on Chant du Cygne yet but I would probably like to have some Crit boosting and Resonance Factor because the whole combo loop builds up crazy resonance.To make this change I had to drop Accelerator and I have to use gear that gives me  load but since I am a huge fan of the Thief class set I can work with that and it can be upgraded up to match the Ebon armor statwise.Also for mobility I would like to bump up the Haste in Greased Lightning to  at least. To get this I would drop the Regen because why would I need Regen with a good Thief Anklet.PS Full disclosure this change was mainly done because I fucking love the animation of Chant du Cygne and want it in no matter what. But I think that I made it work pretty well.,FinalFantasyExplorers,d1qiuaj,1,t5_3599n
