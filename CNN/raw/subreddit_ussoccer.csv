1098052,1,t3_26o4cu,I hear your opinion and I am glad the man has his supporters but I respectfully disagree. He isnt a scapegoat for me in this match as I feel most of the team played poorly against a style of play that we will not face in the World Cup Finals. His selection last night wasnt the best but that isnt his fault. At least he is getting fitness.I dont hate Jones. He is a very specific type of player that works well in certain games and last night was a great example of what he cant do. He cant control the pace of a game or break down defenders or make a long pass to save his life. He doesnt have a good flow with our best player Bradley and often gets in his way and doesnt provide passing options for him. Frankly hes not the player for an attacking game. In a game like that we are much better off with a creative player beside Bradley.But like I said we arent going to be playing games like that in the World Cup. Jones can be valuable in tracking back and stopping play through the air. He can bully players off the ball and provide an extra line of defense against three very attacking teams. So he will have his uses and can likely turn in some good performances if he keeps his head on his shoulders and makes smart challenges. I dont see him ever truly benefiting our attack the way any of our other CMs do. I dont think he expressed vocal leadership other than barking at other players and his loafing around and inability to stay on his feet is not a way to win over fans.Honestly I hope for the best for him and us in the WC Finals.,ussoccer,cht3q4f,4,t5_2sk2p

Same can be said for Manchester Citys title with Mancini who said that United had it wrapped up and it was impossible to win. I think its telling that Klinsmann had the opportunity to redactamend the statement and still chose not to.

1317299,0,t3_2963g4,Ill preface this by saying that I was on the Gonzalez train maybe a year or two ago when he was playing well early in qualifying.  I lost faith in him over the past  months as he fell out of form.  I continue to believe that our best centerback pairing is BeslerCameron but Gonzalez had a mostly great game today.  He used his size to his advantage and was in the right spot to mark German attackers on crosses.  I think were all forgetting that he did have a typical miscue when he whiffed at that cross at his feet early on in the first half.  We were lucky that a German attacker wasnt able to get on the end of it.  Bottom line I think he played a good game and I certainly am more optimistic about our entire defense after three games than I was before the tournament started.  Id still start Cameron next to Besler but I wont be as upset with Klinsmann if he chooses Gonzalez again.  Gotta give a lot of credit to Klinsmann to change up the back line after not starting Gonzalez any of the send off series matches nor either of the first two group matches.  Hes pulling all the right strings.  ,ussoccer,cihta3j,10,t5_2sk2p

Yea yea we advanced out the group stage but people forget that we made it to the semifinal in . This idea that we are  years away from winning the WC is BS. What the U.S. needs and has always needed is a manager with tactical acumen who can help build us a soccer pipeline. If JK is supposed to be that guy we need him to be a champion of MLS and lower division soccer in the U.S. He can give players advice on their careers privately but stop with the headline grabbing quotes dude. And JK was a successful player but what has he done as a coach? A year stint at Bayern Munich? Less than two years with the German National team? Third place in the WC is nice although some argue he was never really tested until he played Italy. I give him the benefit of the doubt and Sunil Gulati really wanted him so I trust US Soccer.

Others have preferred to stay stateside longterm and have done just fine for both club and country. Plus IMHO keeping the best young players in the MLS is a necessary step to growing both the league and the USMNT.

6557005,0,t1_czxdf1z,gt Soccer is no more chaotic than baseball. It can be broken down into tactical moments that influence what kind of decisions need to be made and we as Americans know how to teach that.I agree with you that its about building up instincts regardless of the sport. I think the difference is really that in soccer you are out there for  minutes without a break and without input from the coach and in most other sports you can have a timeout at basically any point in time plus there are numerous regular breaks. I think chaos is a poor word to describe this but this is the real challenge that distinguishes soccer in baseball you have plays being called in constantly sometimes even every pitch. In basketball many coaches call a play every time up the field and in football every play is called. In soccer you must dynamically react to each new situation without stopping and while I agree that it is the same as developing the instincts to turn a double play I maintain that it is fundamentally more complicated. Its a problem that has perhaps  variables more than turning a double play and you dont have a coach to tell you to move into double play depth before the play.,ussoccer,czxjquk,1,t5_2sk2p
6625725,0,t3_46fc0k,Completely dumbfounded how Julie is on there over Becky.  Julie just came onto the scene right before the world cup.

As a pure defender she is far superior and reads the field so well that her outlet passes from the back line are excellent.I am confused why they have Henry in the midfield when Nadine Keler should be there.  She was the Fifa Womens world player of the year in  but because she was injured prior to cup she gets no love? Lastly how do they not have Sinclaire in there as Forward.   all time for goals scored and is on a lesser talented team then the  listed there and Wambach who is  all time.

9197656,0,t1_d8hl2ey,gt I think this is one of those lies damn lies and statistics things.Were talking specifically about things that are tracked by statistics though i.e. turning the ball over. Theres a couple of things to note here First of all Michael Bradley has the highest average passes per game in all of MLS at . Only six players average  ppg Bradley Ozzie Alonso Nigel de Jong Wil Trapp Dax McCarty and Javier Morales. Of those players only Morales has more key passes per game . than Bradley . and the next closest is Alonso at .. Bradley also has the most long balls played per game at  which is more than even defenders and goal keepers. Why these stats are signifcantTeams are asking Mike B to be a deep lying play maker which inherently lends itself to making lowpercentage passes up the field to hold possession and to also be a destroyer. There isnt another player in either MLS or the USMNT who bears as much responsibility as he does and he still manages to come out with consistently good match ratings. The problem of course is negativity bias. Remember hes averaging about  of  passes completed in a game. Of those about  are long balls re low percentage so if we just estimate that hes completing  of the  long balls then of the  misplaced passes  of them are passes he should probably complete and probably only about  are in bad spots and those are the only  passes in the game youre likely to remember. Obviously you dont want to see four passes given away in bad spots but when youre asking a guy to make  passes a game youre gonna get that. Barcelona doesnt even ask that of Sergio Busquets. ,ussoccer,d8hvcbx,2,t5_2sk2p

We have a pretty big gap in that our best playmakers are Benny amp Klejestan who are both past thirty there really arent any great younger domestic players in MLS filling this role in their mid twenties I mean other than Nagbe who is used more as a winger you have like what TMac amp Kelyn Rowe unless say someone like Mauro Diaz gets US Citizenship in the next year or two? I.e not so great. The other options are really young like Hyndman and Zelalem and Maybe Carleton which isnt terrible since they exist at least.

I wish they would of come out aggressive in the same attacking style they did on Friday. One thing to take from this though that is pleasantly surprising is we got some young guys into the game and villafana is a great lb. Omar Gonzalez I hope never sees the field again and although we had no choice zusi was pretty mediocre at rb. Bradley and Jones just dont work together. Bradley goes from solid performance to shiting the bed again but not sure if his or Jones fault. Altidore always seems disinterested in physical away games.

11395909,0,t3_62llbg,Heres the age of the starting lineup you listed in  approximate I just added  to their current age  Wood   Perez   Pulisic   Carleton   Hyndman   Adams   Brooks   CCV   Yedlin   Horvath   That is an average age of . which would have been the youngest of any team at Brazil in  The high for average age was Argentina with . and the low was Ghana at . with Nigeria the only other country less than . The US FWIW was .. Point being that while those are some really exciting prospects and its fun to contemplate what could be I doubt well have a  man midfield that is all between  and  years old.  That lineup is basically  new faces exceptions of Wood Pulisic Yedlin and theres likely to be several other players already within the USMNT system that are still on the team in .Those statistics are actually average roster not average starting lineup age. My total guess is that starting lineups were actually a little older because each team brought along a young player or two that didnt see any real time Like Green for the USMNT.,ussoccer,dfnpls6,13,t5_2sk2p

11584599,0,t1_dg8bhzd,A couple quick point.  First long passes passes over  yards accounted for an avg of  of all MLS passes in .  The completion rate was around .  So although your point is well taken half is a bit of an exaggeration.Second College soccer is an issue but at this point in time most youth soccer players have no other option.  This country is SO big with SO many players that its nearly impossible to get noticed by a professional team unless you live within a very small radius of the team.  Most kids and their parents arent thinking about Pro soccer at all.  Theyre goal is still largely to play college soccer.  Finally its impossible to not have instincts.  The problem is their instincts are wrong.  Take a look at the way young player  are taught to play.  Theyre taught skill move after skill move.  Always taught to take players on and almost never to get their heads up.  So their instincts when they get older is to Dribble.  Dribble Dribble Dribble.  I dont think non coaches have any idea how difficult it is to get players to ignore those instincts.  Coaches in the younger age groups need to work on teaching kids to make decisions. Intelligent soccer players are good soccer players.  We need to be teaching kids to observe their surroundings assess their situation and make appropriate decisions from an early age.  That is how you prepare players.,ussoccer,dg94djv,6,t5_2sk2p
11625694,1,t3_65wlvt,Yes it is possible.  Dortmund and Spurs play styles that are similar. Pulisic is young and the Spurs manager has shown that he values youth in their transfers. His transfer value is probably in their wheelhouse maybe he would be similar to their purchase of Lamella. I believe he was M and was a young fringe player at Roma.  Pulisic is an attacking versatile midlfielder another type of player valued by Spurs. Yes he is a strategic and financial fit for Spurs. ,ussoccer,dgds8yh,3,t5_2sk2p
