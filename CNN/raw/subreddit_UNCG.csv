390816,0,t3_1xehe3,I just responded to another post like this. I just moved here a few weeks ago but I lived in a Grove in Arkansas and it was awesome. They have a lot of cool things to do there like a pool game room and free coffee. You also get your own room bathroom and closet. You only have to share the living room and kitchen. And its furnished so you dont have to worry with furniture. Im not sure exactly where it is but Im sure it is close to campus.,UNCG,cfl9vbm,0,t5_2sdw3

2948582,0,t1_co37iub,Or you can transfer to UNCChapel Hill and join FTAGN Boardgaming Club. This is in reference to DramaticStars comment on my post.But in all seriousness SF was one of the best experiences Ive had at UNCG. The people are definitely amazing. Watch out when playing boardgames though theres some people who cheat even when they say they wont. Just kidding. ,UNCG,co39njz,2,t5_2sdw3

3906022,0,t3_32mkgg,Theres a modest punk scene in greensboro but other than that theres not much.  The Blind Tiger has shows every week but the booking.... the bookings are just not that great.  NYP on Tate Street also has quite a few shows that usually fill up the tiny venue its a fun place.  I bike almost everywhere.  To be honest this town sucks for cyclists but its possible to get around.  There are few designated cycling lanes and those that do exist are often littered with parked cars.,UNCG,cr1irg4,1,t5_2sdw3
8110944,0,t3_4qb7x9,As far as cities go Greensboro is pretty nice and fairly quiet. If youre into clubbing there are a couple clubs uptown. Theres tons of good food in Greensboro. Indian food Chinese and of course American food is around everywhere. If you like animals Friendly pets is great play with pups for free but you need a car. Anything else drop me a PM Id be happy to help out ,UNCG,d4rqrli,2,t5_2sdw3
8542809,0,t3_4wor3v,Yes. Its for all Honors if I remember correctly. I say that because Im in North Spencer and Im disciplinary. Well Im not disciplinary yet. Im an honors freshman thats currently in a weird position because I have all my general education fulfilled so I dont really fit into the International Honors and I am told to just take my normal classes the first semester and sign up to Disciplinary in the spring while the standard honors freshmen have to take their HSS courses and stuff.,UNCG,d69f5gv,1,t5_2sdw3
