2718209,0,t1_cncqcao,Well i live at home and commute  minutes to and from everyday plus it takes an hour to find a parking space. Dorming renting is not what i would like to do cuz northridge can be pretty sketchy especially at night and you cant really do much for entertainment unless you want to go all the way downtown and hang out there. Its really not much of a college experience it feels more like an extension of high school. And i hate the weather in socal. Its always unpredictable trust me ive lived in socal most of my life. Its not that great. Not sure if it helped...?,collegeadvice,cnd1rtm,1,t5_2s7mp

To make sure I dont go into the wrong classroom or miss a class is write down all the classescourse numbers room numbers and datetime I have the class for the week in my notes app on my phone and just check it to make sure its right. Its only the first week! If you miss any notes just ask a classmate before or after class for it. Hope your second week goes better! ,collegeadvice,cnrohy8,1,t5_2s7mp
