I didnt not like the screen.the screen was a semi circle and she performed in the middle with  dancers on the side. It tended to wash miku out. The crowd responded well!

The song tells a story a fabled tale and Miku is recalling her past events in her lifetime. Well actually I have no idea able the lyrics but that is how I interpret the song to be. However I strongly recommend listening to the entire length and the paths and trails in the song. There is sadness there is happiness there is triumph packed into a epic tale of a song.

2217425,0,t1_clli8zu,nd gen here fluent speaker as long as the subject matter stays pedestriannonspecialized. I never experienced an uncanny valley with vocaloids but some of them Rin and Len specifically especially were a bit of an acquired taste. I believe this was more because of how high their voices were and so more detached from human voices than some of the first vocaloids I heard. I may be wrong but IIRC the uncanny valley is supposed to become more prominent the better something mimics us which is why I doubt the valley here. If Im wrong then yeah that mightve been valley antics.Its hard for me to get into the English songs because of the Engrish I think. I hope Im speaking only for myself here but the nd gen identity mightve created conditions that feed my dislike of vocaloid Engrish. Not my proudest thing to admit but when I was younger I had a bit of an aversion to nonperfect English pronunciation. Id like to think Ive grown out of this but I still find vocaloid Engrish to be hard to listen to.One last thing Id like to note. Im one of those people who can never hear out the songs lyrics English Japanese vocaloid or human. Unless its the chorus I will probably be reading the subtitles on those nicodou vids. This was true since my first viewing and couldve affected any perception of an uncanny valley.edit word,Vocaloid,cllorw7,3,t5_2rn75

The main character is a bocchithe articles marked for deletion but thats just a question of relevance the content is soundFor one reason or another she really hates the world her classroom and doesnt want to be considered a part of it. Hence if this class were turned into a movie I dont want my name in the credits. The mood in the lyrics is denial and rejection of a social atmosphere the protagonist considers to be degenerate and superficial. Implicitly shes placing herself in some kind of higher standingmorally? not sure than the other rabble note the angellic wings she grows near the end of the song Im not sure if this is meant to be ironic or selfmocking.If youre interested in this kind of mindset I would recommend the anime Yahari Ore No Seishun Rabukome Wa Machigatteru.

5159282,0,t3_3lodma,Hello rVocaloid. Been a while since I posted a cover of mine in here. I hope you guys still remember older songs hahaha. Ive pretty much stopped listening to new Vocaloid stuff except for the few exVocaloPs I follow but I still like all those songs Ive disovered throughout my more active years. Shinkaron CodeVariant is one of them. Not a huge fan of ORYO in general but this song stuck with me. Its pretty fun to play and the solo is actually one of the most challenging I can play and that I learned by ear so its a pretty good achievement for me! I hope you guys and girls will enjoy it! ,Vocaloid,cv7vvvf,1,t5_2rn75

5750991,0,t3_3tw5xl,Heya Ive been to Mikunopolis  in LA and Miku Expo  also in LA.In Miku Expo  everyone got a swag bag that contained a few flyer ads that were vocaloid related and a single Miku Expo branded glowstick green color.  So if they are running Miku Expo  the same way as they did for last years you shouldnt have to worry about not getting any glowsticks since everyone that picks up a swag bag will get one They had PLENTYYYY of bags to give away Edit Not Mikunopolis branded glowsticksI honestly cant remember if they gave away glowsticks for Mikunopolis.  Its been so long and I actually brought my own set at the time.However if the venue itself does not allow glowsticks thats a serious bummer since half the fun IMHO is being able to participate in the cheering and Id imagine its not as meaningful or entertaining without everyone waving and cheering with the glowsticks in unison.If youve been to any other nonvocaloid related concert theyre pretty similar in all honesty. Lots of flashing lights super loud music that you can feel hitting your chest lots of cheering and jumping.. The place usually gets a bit hot and you will definitely sweat if youre jumping and swinging your glowsticks around nonstop.The cheering choreography itself is pretty straightforward. If you dunno what to do just copy what the people in front of you are doing or look up videos on youtube.Im not sure if theyve fixed this yet but hopefully you got seats that are somewhat centered with the screen since the images being projected to the glass seem to become more transparent at extreme angles.If this is your first Miku concert youre going to have the time of your life.  Itll be life changing.  Oh yeah and make sure to use the bathroom before the concert starts!,Vocaloid,cx9ys0v,8,t5_2rn75

I also just found out that Ive unlocked everything in the shops except for things where you need to beat the songs on super hard mode which Ive not even unlocked for any of the six songs its for. So basically Ill never unlock those things because I cant do the majority of songs on hard. Im just not good enough. I have yet to  any song on any mode because I always get a couple fine because my fingerhand locks up.

9289804,0,t3_579w1s,PSVR owner here. I bought Live VR the second I got home.Its awesome if you have money to spend. It was  for the first stage which has  songs you can pick and a private encore that doesnt have an option to choose.Theres not a ton of actual gameplay. You have to shake your controller in the same rhythm as the crowd. In progressive songs you can choose your glow stick green red three of them a leek a tambourine. Occasionally Miku will talk to the audience and you have to yell konnichiwa or ehhhhhhhh. Playing through the games earns you different outfits you can choose in the private encore.Lack of gameplay aside its a crazy experience. It feels like you can reach out and touch the other audience members. Miku feels like she is in the room with you. I had a few tears.I look at this game as a proof of concept. Hopefully someone in Japan will use VR tech to give us other experiences like this. Id love to see an Ims or Raibu game where you go their lives. ,Vocaloid,d8tjs8n,1,t5_2rn75

Because of that I like both versions but I prefer the V bank simply because theres less phoneme switching I have to do.
