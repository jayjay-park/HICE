1731490,0,t1_ciyr9s5,The essence of capitalism is voluntary exchange between individuals. However what the layperson usually means by capitalism is the collusion between the state and corporations. Thats called crony capitalism which is not capitalism at all but something diametrically opposite.With voluntary exchange comes competition and with competition the prices essentially drop to the cost to produce the good with a small overhead. The only thing that can keep drugs expensive is FDA and patent laws which get in the way of competition which benefits the consumer.,longevity,cjxf3b2,1,t5_2qzmo

3465126,0,t1_cpn8uv4,gtReally the issue from what I understand is that cancer is more likely to survive the bodys various defenses and become malignant if you have longer telomeres. If the cancer has shorter telomeres its more likely that the immune system will be capable of handling it before it actually becomes a real problem. Telomeres dont have anything to do with the immune system.The issue here is that if a cell is overproducing telomerase the enzyme that causes telomere growth so its telomeres keep getting longer that cell can replicate itself endlessly forever and rapidly without ever running out of cycles.  Thats one of the mutations that has to happen in order for a cell to turn cancerous because cancer cells have to reproduce rapidly and spread in order to turn dangerous.  It doesnt make a cell into a cancer cell by itself but its one of the necessary mutations to allow that to happen.Other things can cause telomeres to get longer or shorter and those arent linked to cancer.   Its just that one specific type of mutation that cancer cells have.  A cell that has long telomeres but doesnt overproduce telomerase still cant become a cancer cell because its still limited in how many times it can duplicate itself.,longevity,cpn8zbf,2,t5_2qzmo

If I go along a bit of a longer way I might get them curious. The front page doesnt deal with all the details but it is just trying to slowly plant into their minds the seed of the doubt that perhaps ageing isnt okay after all.I am not sure mine is the best way to go so Ill think about your idea. I already have written things as concisely as possible in the lengthy Advocacy section its organized in paragraphs and wherever applicable in subheadings. This just isnt a simple topic and I think that if I want to get people to understand I need to crack the shell of their prejudice just a few words no matter how wise wont do it Im afraid.

6458354,0,t3_442o51,Absolutely nothing. Certain events in my life have led me to believe quantum immortality is true hence I already expect to live indefinitely. Even before that my goal was to be the last thing living. Ever. Because I want to see the final moment that can be seen.You know Ive been living this way for so long I dont actually feel any particular empathy understanding or connection to the me who was there before I made that choice. Interesting.Prior to the events that shifted my beliefs as regards quantum immortality I had a few contingency plans and a planned to live my life somewhat more agressively. Now it seems as if theres little point in leaving a footprint on history because the length of my future is indefinite.Honestly... Im not happy or sad or anything about it. Time isnt my enemy but it isnt my ally either. Time is not my anything and so things to which it has realtion  or which believe that it has relation to them  are largely beyond my concern. I look at them and think this too shall die.For the sake of my indefinite sanity I ceased having any strong relationships with other human beings beyond my closest family members shorlty after I decided to live forever. Im currently trying to gently persuade said family members into being prolife extension and proactive about it but one day our paths through phase space will diverge and Ill see them die. I just dont want it to happen early although after sufficiently many gigayears everything will seem to have been early. Tempus futilit I guess.As for the future Id look towards most?Its the one where we gain the ability to travel in phase space. Even then Id still be immortal but I could escape from the corollary of eventually losing everyone I loved.If thats not possible... well itd go a long way towards proving my hypothesis that the universe is actually hell.

6727063,0,t1_d0d1uec,If youre claiming its just an assumption that we age because of metabolism then there has to be specific errors in the way science describes the way crosslinks are formed and their part in aging and you should be able to point these errors out.gtIt aging was caused by crosslinks parabiosis would have to reverse it since parabiosis reverses aging.This is a really basic error. Crosslinks arent all of aging and its perfectly possible to reverse parts of aging without touching crosslinks. Your claim that young blood reverses crosslinks needs specific evidence. As far as I know they only tested for aging by doing things like measuring muscles and cognitive ability and the like i.e. stuff on the macro level. In other words we have no idea what parabiosis did to cells and molecules though presumably it did something.,longevity,d0f4xy0,1,t5_2qzmo

Occasional recreational use for pain or to reduce anxiety is probably fine. If smoking helps you sleep at night that offers an immediate benefit since lack of sleep really messes with your body in numerous ways.But it seems silly to me to get crazy with pot  smoking it all day everyday like kids I knew in high school.  That brainfry phenomena you see in the movies and TV I saw firsthand with several friends growing up. They went from normal kids to total stoners over about  years time.  It absolutely affected their mental capabilities motivation alertness etc. Whoever says that it cant happen is lying or misinformed.So the drug is not harmless but taking too much of anything all the time probably isnt a good idea.
