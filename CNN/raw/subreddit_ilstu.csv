5268561,0,t3_3n4dl1,Great stuff here. A couple additions from a towniepart time ISU employeelawyer.Housing. Make sure your roommate is paying hisher share of rent. Most likely there is a joint and several liability clause in your lease. This is lawyer speak for theyll sue all of you for the rent even if only one guy was failing to pay his share. Go see the lawyer in campus before your legal problems get too bad. Eds a great guy with great advice. Drinking. Dont drink and drive. If you are pulled over for drinking and driving you are not legally required to perform field sobriety tests. The officer doesnt have to tell you this. Hell say things like I need to check to make sure you are good to drive. What this actually means is I need more evidence to use against you to establish your guilt. If the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe you are drunk he can require to you to provide a breath or blood sample. He will read you a warning before this. If you blow over  license gone for  months. If you refuse  license gone for a year.If you are underage dont drink. Dont use a fake ID. Either charge can result in you losing your license for a year. Even if you werent driving.Stores. Red racoon games downtown has games nights for a variety of board games. Check out their Facebook page for dates and what games they will be playing. Put down your phone and go have a conversation with another human. ,ilstu,cvl48tv,4,t5_2s609

Stairsonly in fire alarms. It creates its own weather. Ask folks about the wind tunnel. Its brutal in winter. Its proximity to the railroad means really loud train noises at times.
