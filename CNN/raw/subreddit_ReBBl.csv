10300013,0,t3_5nhb9d,Since LiamCoulston and I started preparing for the weekly review show for the Big O Sandune has been one of the coaches who has offered to share his experience and help out any way he can so first I want to give him a big shout out for that.As for my question the runner is a positional in Dark Elf teams where their merits are often debated. In his Dark Elf team Sandune has a runner who is built as a QB style thrower so I would be interested in hearing his opinions both on the runner in dark elf teams generally and why he chose to skill up his runner the way he did.Big O Represent!ps. I apologise for how utterly devoid of humour this question is.,ReBBl,dcbk90g,1,t5_3i18u

He came across as cool and calm and well thought out as when he is coaching! This is one of my favourites so far. Keep em rolling Metal and Ill keep the questions coming!!

10454643,0,t1_dcswmju,Despite being heavy favorites the Pastry Pests tied the Handsome Jacks in season . In a postgame interview Choco Chipmunk had this for comment.I dont know what hit us. Their ogre charged straight at Marmint.  He smacked him and then proceeded to body slam him so hard they needed to bring out the stretcher.  I was getting ready to receive the ball when suddenly the monster gets up and was coming for me.  I tried to get out of the way but he shoved me to the ground and jumped on me too.  I was fortunate to get out with only a dislocated leg.When your team has a giant that can crush players under his weight thats huge.The player of the game Huge Jackedman recorded  casualties and  KO.,ReBBl,dct4z7o,4,t5_3i18u

10515911,0,t3_5ql20g,Hi All Im Superfedtv coach of the Orc team Brazzerz and Im totally new to REBBL and effectively started playing blood bowl a month ago after catching Strippin and Krendor by accident. That said Im an all or nothing kind of person and since I caught the Blood Bowl bug Ive gone full ham probably no less than  matches in the last month. The timing for this leagues new season was perfect for me and judging by the amount of new teams Im guessing my story isnt all that unique. One of the coolest things Ive seen in the Blood Bowl and more specifically the REBBL community is the side content write ups streams commentary. I love it. The weekly progress originally seemed like it would be too slow but with the recaps and write ups it works out great. This past week with the outpouring over a fallen player has been inspiring and while I feel a little on the outside looking in I know that it has to start somewhere. So Im going to pitch in. I have some experience streaming and creating video content and dabbled in writing a little in spare time at work. So I plan on creating content around the league but with so many teams I plan on starting somewhat small and going from there. For now I plan on focusing on the REL Divisions  which seem to be made up of mostly new teams. Tracking their progress and looking for any stand out star players in the making. If time allows for more Ill try to expand to the O G leagues but with the focus still being on the up and comers. Anytime I see the recap of my division I get all giddy with excitement to see what others think of my team and my hope is that I can pay that kind of feeling forward but I cant catch everything so if you feel like you have a star player in the making on your team feel free to shoot me a note too. Thanks for reading feedback of all kinds welcome seriously!,ReBBl,dd03asv,2,t5_3i18u
