1788183,0,t1_ck4finm,Yeah I have always rooted for Penn State because of family. I always was a big Joepa fan. I am so glad the off season is over. Its been too long since UCF played. And with how we ended last season the wait had been hard!,UCFKnights,ck4jwe7,2,t5_2syyt

9662344,0,t1_da34izc,It was not undiagnosed and OLeary was found at trial to have been a barrier to medical assistance.  Theres a reason UCF had a huge verdict against them.He has a very mixed record overall.  He certainly professionalized the football program won some big games had an excellent academic record and built the football largedonor community but he had poor relationships with the average fans two winless seasons the latter of which clearly hurt in the Big  expansion discussing and several other losing seasons in addition to offfield incidents like Ereck Plancher dying. Also how about the record against USF and embarrassing losses to FIU?  We dodged a huge bullet when he was asked to retire and not given the reigns as AD.  He would have been disastrous given his disdain for marketing and disrespect toward the average fan and wed have his incompetent crony Brent Key in charge.  At any rate doing a statue now is too soon and Im glad UCF is trying to minimize the whole ordeal.  I think some of the large donors insisted on it.  A few years perspective perhaps after Frost has fully cleaned up the onfield mess would have been much kinder to George and his reception on Saturday.,UCFKnights,da43429,1,t5_2syyt
