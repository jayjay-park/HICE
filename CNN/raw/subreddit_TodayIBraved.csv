This is a tale of connections made and missed punishing regrets and the grace of second chances. Intense hilarious provocative and moving A Long Way Down is a novel about suicide that is surprisingly full of life. Whats your jumpingoff point? MaureenWhy is it the biggest sin of all? All your life youre told that youll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh I can see that its a kind of queuejumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office people tut. Or sometimes they say Excuse me I was here first. They dont say You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity. That would be a bit strong. MartinId spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time the coroner says the same thing He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed. And then you read the story about the poor bastard His wife was sleeping with his best friend hed lost his job his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello Mr. Coroner? Im sorry but theres no disturbed mental balance here my friend. Id say he got it just right. JessI was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo spaceout reggae. At midnight one of them clapped sarcastically and a couple of others laughed and that was itHappy New Year to you too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London and youd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasnt the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously. JJNew Years Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course thered be a lowrent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier datelike March  when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river or November  Nick Drake. If anybody had been on the roof on either of those nights the chances are they would have been likeminded souls rather than hopeless fckups who had somehow persuaded themselves that the end of a calendar year is in any way significant.gt .gt .gt .gt . gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt BOOK..ONLINE..
