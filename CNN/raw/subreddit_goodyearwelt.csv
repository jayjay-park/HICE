288535,0,t3_1xepd0,I actually think they are s as the pair in the photos does not appear to be storm welted. In addition my s do not have a RW logo on the uppers.In the American market I would say that no they are not worth  USD probably more around  which is not that far off considering you would have to pay that difference to get a similar pair to Australia in the first place. The condition of the sole is a big determinant in price. I would assume that these would need a resole soon if not immediately so factor the costs of a resole into the equation as well. I think if you can get the seller down to  USD range that would be a better price for you considering these look like they need some refurbishment and shoe trees.,goodyearwelt,cfao603,6,t5_2w64o

543400,0,t3_20cfq9,I have a pair of Rancourt natural shell loafers. Havent worn them that much since I got them at the end of last season.Its a great material looks beautiful. However there are going to be some imperfections and you are not going to get a perfect pair of these. These are handsewn by a company that is of the opinion that handsewn doesnt mean perfect pairs. I cant emphasize this enough. For example one of the shoes has some wrinkles that showed up once I put them on just because of the way the shoe flexed with my foot in it. No big deal to me and absolutely nothing Rancourt can do about that with unlined shoes. Also the penny slots have a bit of an odd shape to them apparently just the way the leather reacted to being punched with that particular die. I have pictures of them up in the Styleforum Rancourt thread.So yeah I think they look great and they arent dress shoes. There are some mixed opinions on this but my opinion is that you cant expect a small company to allow you to get madetoorder custom shell shoes and expect them to absorb potentially  pairs of seconds to get it  correct. You might get something flawless my shell rangers or you might get something that look wonderful but also look handmade as my beefrolls.

635088,0,t3_21f424,Any half decent cobbler can talk the talk all day but youll need to basically test the cobbler by trailing their lesser services before opting for more comprehensive work like resoles. At some point though you will have to take the plunge and sometimes good cobblers make mistakes. Re RecraftingAllen Edmonds recraft is different than a resole. Allen Edmonds rewelts the shoe using the existing insole but replaces the gemming and cork filling. This basically requires the original last but a similar last would work but is not ideal. The package is much more comprehensive than a basic resole. Cobblers like B Nelson also provide these services as well and probably your local cobbler but you dont have one that you trust yet. What Im trying to say here is that you shouldnt balk at the recrafting costs before understanding what they actual entail. ,goodyearwelt,cgcgkhs,9,t5_2w64o

They have exceeded my expectations and are holding up fantastically. The leather is still in great shape even after not conditioning them at all for the first two years of ownership. The sole is still in good shape and is not close to needing resoling. Also after the initial breakin which wasnt bad at all they have become incredibly comfortable like the most comfortable boots I have ever put on my feet and have only continued to get better. Initial comfort was great fresh out of the box which is one of the reasons why I bought them.

1014029,0,t1_chjake6,Red Wings are great American work boots but we need to go deeper. Like all boot brands there are some cheap shitty models. Go to site and sort by Made in USA and if you want waterproof boots then select the Goretex water proofing method its far superior to there alternative and more breathable. That should narrow it down quite a bit. The most important thing to look at is the CONSTRUCTION category. You better make sure it says some sort of welted construction dual density super sole welt or something like that. By sorting made in usa they should all be welted boots. The made in China boots might be Direct attach construction where they just fuse the bottom and top together. Its much cheaper but can come apart quickly avoid at all costs. Welted boots can also be resoled so the uppers should last for as long as youre able to take care of them. This is a good year welt sub after all! Write down the model numbers of the boots you like and go get fitted for them. Im a huge fan of the   boot. The Green triangle on the tongue tells everyone that your boot meets some special safety criteria that may be required in some job sites. I think puncture resistant and steel toed I have a surveying background so I like to know my boots wont be punctured going through some uncharted land. EDIT that is about a  boot though but you might find another one a little cheaper using those criteria. You can get it resoled after a couple years of wear.,goodyearwelt,chjjw3a,6,t5_2w64o

1352101,0,t3_29ka5n,There is actually a brand that does a modified Goodyearwelted construction FEIT although Im not intimately familiar with how their construction works.That being said there are sneakers that are resoleable due to their stitched constructions. Common Projects Buttero MMM Epaulets new sneakers etc uses stitched constructions that are resoleable although the resole process isnt easy. You would have to find a cobbler who could do it and the sole although Ive heard Buttero will ship you the sole if you ask. Again Im not intimately familiar with the construction method but I believe its simply a stitch through the upper and upturned edge of the sole.Generally Goodyearwelting is not done on sneakers because it takes up too much space and because it requires a shelf to place the welt. Most people are looking for slimmer sneakers and so Goodyearwelting isnt helpful. In addition it requires the presence of a welt so you need to have somewhere to put the welt. Usually that ruins the lines of the shoe from a sneaker perspective.I hope that helps somewhere.,goodyearwelt,cilrzr9,11,t5_2w64o

One their lasts the heels are lined with metal so that when the nail strikes the metal piece of the last the nail cinches. That is one of the reasons why they use a heelpad.

1763580,0,t1_ck1gaa5,You should be able to scratch away the grain to reveal the corium  beneath the surface of a leather welt. This wont always be the case as there are plenty of split leather welts out there but you want the welt to act like leather when you scratch it. Go try it on the tongue of your wks where it wont be seen. Scratch the leather with your thumb and see how the leather acts. You basically want a welt to act in the same way. Some leather welts will be tougher than others but if it is leather you should be able to indent and scratch it. If you find that a welt appears to be leather but is virtually unscratchable even when applying a large amount of force with your thumbnail youre probably looking at leatherboard it is hard to scratch a leatherboard welt with a key. If you find that you can indent the welt but when you scratch it you do not reveal anything different beneath the surface youre probably looking at PVC.

Any shoe store should have them sitting around somewhere. The general rule of thumb for the trubalance last that Indys are on is to go one half size down from your brannock so if youre a D then go with .D etc. I could have probably gone down a full size though so its all up to what youre comfortable with. You want no heel slippage.And in the future we have a daily simple questions and general discussion thread that gets a lot of activity so this question would be appropriate for that thread ,goodyearwelt,cklr6dx,1,t5_2w64o

Id call it a partial success.  One boot is quiet the other makes a bit of noise but less than before.He used a smooth leather Id been envisioning something more like suede.  Now instead of rubbing on the hard midsole its rubbing against the leather which is a bit quieter but not perfect.  I think if it had been suede or something else notsmooth it would probably have worked.The other possibility is that that theres something broken in the midsole area and what I think is the insole rubbing is actually two parts of the midsole rubbing against each other.

2161937,0,t1_clek8qz,gt What really blows my mind is that you wore these boots I think once? They look like youve beaten them to hell over  months.Yes this is about  hours total. Stance was decent out of the box. And I said it before in this thread but it is tough to produce a good grain out leather for these boots. Everyone wants grain out leathers but they dont want to pay for it. The roughout or split leathers handle the creasing better obviously but they are not as desirable. Split leather yields probably result in cheaper side prices so all in all I think they did a decent job with the leather given the pricepoint. I agree with you on the price increase but staying under that  mark I feel is very important for the entry level customers. ,goodyearwelt,clemr0o,2,t5_2w64o

2354409,0,t1_cm2n1zq,I just bought the Linemans off of a fellow Canadian on one of the BST threads about a month ago. I got them almost new though Ive been wearing them a ton probably every other day since then especially since the snow sets in. I think its probably a little early to say how well theyre doing but no complaints from me so far. They look very workbootish which is what I wanted so Im happy.As far as suitability for temperatures go Im in a different situation than most people here I live in Saskatchewan where weve had snow on the ground for about  weeks and its currently going from about  degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime to F at nights. The boots are definitely fine for going to work etc but I couldnt speak to their ability to hold up once the temperatures get into JanFeb lows. For most people in the USA I think itll hold up fine. Personally I very much want a pair of Ice Cutters for myself to check them out with the lining but thats on hold until I find them on sale.

2507704,0,t3_2ocbs2,Will try to answer these to the best of my abilities but you should get more responses in the U.S. morning or if you post in the GD thread.Generally you do not need to condition leather that often. It will vary depending on how often you wear them and under what conditions but youll be able to tell when the need it as they will feel dry and will lookfeel rougher. Certain areas will show those qualities quicker such as along the ball flex point. At least once a seasonquarter should be good. Lexol is fine.Polishing is a surface dyetreatment and doesnt really need to be done for boots.If your feet get wet it would probably be good to use a sealant but it is again not necessary. Generally Obenaufs HDLP is the product that is recommended here for that.Get yourself some shoe trees especially considering youll be getting the boots wet often. They will help deter contraction as the boots dry out. If you can let the boots have a days rest alternate footware before wearing them again so that they arent constantly wet.

2516659,0,t3_2oh6hn,So its getting cold and I was in the market for a new pair of slippers. I had seen these Quoddys on East Dane and thought they looked insane. I was on the fence about picking these up as I was struggling to justify the price premium over say a pair of LL Bean sheepskin lined slippers. Under normal circumstances I wouldve waited for these to go on clearance but there was only one left in my size and I didnt want to take the chance for it to go out of stock so I took advantage of the Black Friday week deals to grab these at a slight discount.    The Details  Quoddy Lodge Moc  Upper Leather Suede with CXL Trim  Dark Brown  Lace Rawhide Leather  Black  Lining White Sheepskin  Sole Handsewn Horween Chromepak Sole  Light Brown      Impressions  These are some seriously tricked out slippers. I dont think I wouldve changed a thing if I were to think about having Quoddy custom a pair. In terms of pure practicality I am sure that they are just as comfy and warm as any other sheepskin lined slippers but the uniqueness in the way that they look is just miles ahead of anything else out there. I love the contrast between the suede and the leather trim. The sheepskin is soft warm and comfy as expected. What I really love is the interesting stitching pattern on these slippers. I havent seen another example of a moc sewn in this way as you usually see horizontal or cross stitching but these are vertical. Immediately after putting these on I knew that I was keeping them. To me they are definitely worth the price premium. I just look forward to putting them on every morningevening while lounging around in sweats,goodyearwelt,cmn2cyy,3,t5_2w64o

I paid a little under  for the pair and although I have only worn them around the house for a moment I can safely say theyre by far the highest quality sneakers Ive ever held. The suede is so buttery soft and smooth and the padding in between the liner and the outside so thick and luxurious. It definitely makes you redefine what you thought a sneaker could be. For sizing I took a bit of an educated guess. Im a . brannock and everything I read said to size down so I got a . At first when I took them out of the box I thought to myself No chance in hell these are going to fit. WAAY to small. I had to unlace the top few eyelets just to get them on but once I did they actually felt pretty good. Length was perfect though they were a bit narrow overall. I imagine after I wear them a while theyll stretch out to just about perfect. Anyways as far as Im concerned the hype is real and Im looking forward to grabbing a pair of black suede low tops whenever I see a pair in the  neighborhood. If these end of lasting and looking good over time I might just cave and shell out more if it feels like the value is there. I mostly wear boots and mostly just have a few pair of junky sneakers for rare occasions but Im definitely looking forward to getting these into my weekly routine. ,goodyearwelt,cmvl57y,10,t5_2w64o

We dont exactly praise them here but mostly from a value perspective.Theyre priced right around what the PNW makers charge and their quality is far and away better. Their CS is incredible. OSB on the other hand has had lots of issues with their customers.Previously they needed to mark their boots and handsewns up because they did not make them. They may have invested in the factory in NY that makes their boots but I havent seen any evidence of it. Their handsewns are farmed out to Maine.This isnt a bad thing necessarily. But it means they have to mark them up in a way that Nicks Chippewa or Red Wing dont.Theyre in this odd price point that makes them not that much better than Red Wing but  more.

My wife is a pediatric neurosurgery PA and my son had a really traumatic birth in which he was without oxygen for an extended period of time and had to undergo brain cooling.  Its amazing how plastic the infant brain is hes now  months old and doing great despite his scary birth.  The neurologist said that the brain cooling in combination with the newborn brains ability to rewire itself is probably the reason hes not showing any effects of his dramatic entrance to the world.

2913396,0,t1_cnz2isg,Bought the pair from uTooBeau?I love the christy sole on my pair. It stands out from all of the other typical block heel Vibergs that are out there. Vibergs are rare enough as it is in the USA and christy soled Vibergs are even rarer still. It is also insanely comfortable its way more comfortable than my dainite Vibergs and my leather soled Vibergs.Heres a picture of my Pauw olive chromepak boots next to my brown waxed flesh boots on dainite. The color is different enough for me to justify keeping both of them IMO. The olive chromepak looks incredible with black jeans whereas Id probably never wear my waxed flesh boots with black jeans because they have too much of a workwear look to them. Here is a fit pic of me wearing the olive chromepaks. The instagram filter fucked up the color but hopefully it gives you an idea of how they can be worn. The dark coffee chromepak looks like it would be a similarly dark shade of brown like my waxed flesh boots.

For such a wellbuilt boot in such a great leather Im okay with the wait.BuildAs I mentioned in my post about the olive chromexcel pair Nicks accidentally made for me I made a few changes to the build. I didnt want to end up with two boots identical save for the leather.   inch Robert Olive Chromepak Vibram  Antique hooks and eyes Black tongue Black finish Dogger heel Cap toeI kind of wish Id left the edge finish alone but at least it makes them a bit different from my other boots.ImpressionsTheyre just like my other pair. The fit feels exactly the same. In fact the three pairs of Nicks Ive tried on in this size all felt the same. Thats worth mentioning I think because my two pairs of Whites feel different in spite of being the same size.The laces seen here are some that I cut myself. Unlike my CXL pair these didnt come with rawhide laces. The ones I threw on are oil tan and theyll work okay until rawhide laces arrive.I included some pics of the chromepak and chromexcel alongside one another. You can see that the chromexcel leans brown. The chromepak is straight up dark olive with some yellow kind of seen in the pull up. ,goodyearwelt,coxakix,7,t5_2w64o

3274500,0,t3_2xikmd,If this this is a fluoropolymerbased waterproofing spray.     Collonils FAQ and youtube are informativegtIn which order should waterproofing sprays and care products be used?  gtFor a satisfying result clean the shoe first then use a waterproofing spray and only after that apply caring products. This way the waterproofers active agents penetrate into the leathers deeper layers and can therefore develop a long lasting effect. BUT Our Nano products make an exception here because they leave a water repellent structure on the surface and should therefore only be used at the end of the cleaning and caring procedure.  gt  gtHow do I waterproof appropriately?  gtSpray from a distance of  cm in order to produce a fine spray dust. For basic waterproofing repeat the spraying procedure at least  times and make sure the material does not get too wet. To renew the waterproofing repeat the procedure after you have worn the shoes  times.  gt  gtWhat is the best way to dry my shoes?  gtNever dry your shoes next to heat sources because it makes the leather brittle. Even using a hairdryer is not such a good idea. If you want your shoes to dry quickly stuff them with newspaper to draw the moisture out of the leather. Additionally we recommend wooden shoe trees.  gt  gtDo I need to waterproof new shoes?  gtAs a rule yes. New shoes are rarely waterproofed by the manufacturer before selling. After purchasing we recommend you spray them at least  times before wearing.,goodyearwelt,cp1iqa9,1,t5_2w64o

3605218,0,t3_31nj0b,A shoe that fits right will feel snug but not tight. Your toes should not feel compressed a sign of too narrow or short there should not be overlap of your toes ouch too narrow and your forefoot should not be sliding around too wide or really at any part of the foot. Some of it is up to personal preference.A shoe can also be too wide in the heel leading to excessive amounts of heel slip. This is a sign that the last is just not intended for your foot.Please check out our fit and sizing information in the sidebar,goodyearwelt,cq37yft,2,t5_2w64o

So increase weight and lower breathability.  Probably great for the winter but not so much for summer.  Haha yea social norms definitely prohibit airing out your pants in public.I feel like for pants to be in that range for me theyd have to be some really fantastic fabric plus the ideal fit and a handful of neat details.

Interesting to note that they were designed by a doctor who had broken his ankle and needed a more comfortable boot. Almost as though significant swelling were factored into the dimensions lol...As far as the sole well no more foot knee and back pain. I walk  hours a day on concrete at my job and these soles are perfect for that. Hiking no the soles are just too big and flat. Yes they are a bit tough to break in.

3943601,0,t1_cr5pnqc,Those vibergs look gorgeous. That texture is something else and the stitching and sole contrast really makes it pop.  editI also totally agree about leather soles. I have a pair of BBSurrey? Wingtips that were broken into someone elses feet and used to be incredibly uncomfortable. When I bought my thousand miles I was incredibly impressed by how comfortable the soles were even before break in.

3962517,0,t3_35umam,ALBUM HEREBackgroundEver since I started getting into goodyear welted footwear Id been looking to get a black boot. Trouble is I was paralysed by paranoia either being crushed by buyers remorse or completely screwing up sizing. My own indecisiveness didnt help  I couldnt choose between the workwear aesthetic and the more military service boot  leaving me to push the idea on the back burner.That changed during last weekend when I finally decided to hit up the Red Wing store in London and pull on a few pairs to work out what I liked. I had a few ideas  the review of the Harvester by ublaster managed to edge them above the Iron Rangers and I knew RW did them in black. But I also loved the sole and heel aesthetic of the Nicks x VP  Captoes that upirieca ordered so my mind seemed to be a bit split.After getting to the store on Saturday afternoon I decided to try on the Iron Rangers and Harvesters in black with the Harvesters being a clear winner. But theyre also a bit close to my Loake Samuels and so didnt give me more variety other than the colour and shape.Id almost decided on the Harvesters but on a whim asked if I could give the Engineers a go. And I was blown away. The BootThese are like nothing Ive ever worn before. Heavy duty serious workwear boots. Theyre black chrome edit not chromexcel as stated in the title  sorry! with a steel toecap a lugged sole and fluted heel. The nickel buckles are easy to pull in and the stitching is solid throughout. I feel like I could stomp through nuclear fallout with these things strapped to my feet.The fit is unusual as Id not felt anything like it before. My feet pushed in with a pop much like pulling on wellies but were solid and secure around my feet. The calf buckle feels weird and will take some getting used to but it doesnt feel wrong. And with my cuffed jeans hanging over them the outside seam rests neatly on top of the buckle providing excellent jeansboot interaction.Sizing Im normally an  UK standard width but went down half a size for these to .Looking down on them from above was misleading to me as it looked like I had two black blobs on my feet. But from any other ankle they looked like classy workwear almost like rugged monkstrap boots. Theyve got that blend of practicality and unusual eccentricity that I love and I was truly smitten with them.Then my wife said I wasnt leaving the store without them and that was that.My only complaint so far is that the heel stack isnt rubber and leather. Instead it seems like a plastic block has been used to create the separation and I think Ill look to replace this when it comes to resoling them. Other than that I think theyre amazing boots and great value for money and I cant wait to share some fit pics wearing them!,goodyearwelt,cr7yl1a,3,t5_2w64o

They didnt know the construction what was inside etc. Im not sure that they picked materials because of solid knowledge or because that feels comfortable and is cheap. They just seemed out of the loop and while maybe Im a weirdo outlier Id like to know as much as I can about a product or industry before getting into it.Couple that with the poor quality and the boots feel overpriced.,goodyearwelt,crlc0p7,1,t5_2w64o

4162338,0,t1_crukops,I definitely like the different settings. They have something to offer. I just prefer my postapocalyptic settings in the desert. Within the larger universe of science fiction I think they tend to allow for higher stakes. Theyre more likely to have more groups of more organized survivors than urban areas. In Fallout the Vaults help keep people around. And I think that they got the balance right in the two new games. The factions in  seemed smaller and less in control of territories. But in NV they had this great setting full of tribes and factions competing in between a standoff between two large militaries trying to rebuild society.Either way I love me some more Fallout. They could set it in Salina Kansas and Id probably still be excited.I hear you on Halo. As Ive gotten older my critical standards have fallen. I like the universe its in. ODST was decent. I enjoyed Reach.  was pretty silly at the end. On the Playstation I really liked Infamous. I never played the second one but absolutely loved the first.

I got my Brown Dress boots back and the heel was much better but they were apparently uninterested in revamping with better leather. Its a real shame because I think it ruins the appearance of the Dress leather. Theyre real comfy boots and I think they look pretty cool but unfortunately Im regretting the  height and the Cuban heel. I should have just stuck to what seems to be my favorite combo on boots   shaft height and block heel.I think you saw my  Distressed RO right? That was my last pair. Theyre actually giving me a lot of pain in my ankle where I have a big puffy vein over my ankle bone. It seems when I wrap my ankle to add some padding between me and the boot it helps but thats a weird thing to have to do every time I wear them.

4579026,0,t1_ct7rxf1,Yep this is where you ask simple questions!I had this happen to me a few times with some footwear I owned its a simple fix and things to remember so it doesnt happen again.  You should get some white vinegar dilute it however much you want doesnt really matter bc sometimes I dont even dilute put it on a cloth and go into your boot to wipe it down. Undoing the laces helps your reach.  Then get a damp cloth and go in and rewipe the area so that youre removing some of the residual vinegar.  Then get a dry cloth and wipe around.  Make sure you hit all the mold in the toe box though or else itll come back.  Just look in with a flashlight or something.From now on when you come home after a long day let your boots air out for a few hours first.  I will normally take my shoesboots off right when I get into the house let them sit for a few hours while I work out or something and then once Im done I put the shoe trees back in.  If you put the trees in right after it traps all the moisture in the toe box and doesnt let it escape.  The wood can only absorb so much and I wouldnt be surprised if you see some mold on the trees as well I did.

If you dont actually need to live out in the country then you shouldnt.

Theres serious talk of just letting those I dont want neighbors people die in the blaze.Not to mention the other ecological impacts. You have a much smaller carbon footprint if you live in a city and thats more important now than it ever has been.Plus the over valuation of isolated or rural land is putting pressure on lower profit agriculture to sell out.

Sagara x NoKipple Cap Toe Boot  UK album  Grailed LinkThese are from Sagaras collaboration with NoKipple and feature a brogue toe cap and curved hemshaft. Great condition literally worn once.  degree handwelted according to Sagara looks fantastic no real flaws. Double leather sole vintage cats paw heel. These are a size D US UK. They are a bit big on me as I am a  DE Brannock but fit alright with an insole. Theyd probably fit well for a .E or D brannock. I did a review on these here and heres the boot on the webstore still at about  on sale. Comes with their dust bags. b Store Chukkas  EU album  Grailed LinkThese are from the b Store from about  years ago. These are a size  or size  US but they fit quite small too small for my  DE brannock. Would probably fit a .D brannock or small  well. They have only been worn inside for a couple hours basically brand new. b Store is a fashion house and do a lot of Opening Ceremonys shoe designs. These were around  originally. Some of the softest leather Ive ever felt. These are a navy blue with a crepe sole. Comes with a nice dust bag. Grenson Ankle Boots  G UK album  Grailed LinkThese are Grensons mustard yellow ankle boots with all speed hooks. Have a light outsole so make for very comfortable walking especially in the city. Grenson size  G which translates to around a D US these fit me alright with the laces tied tight but would probable fit a D or .E brannock better. Probably some of my lightest boots. These have some minimal wear but have plenty of life left in them the sole has even gotten too much wear as you can see. Quoddy Chukka  D US album  Grailed LinkThese are black Quoddy Chukkas with a crepe sole. They are a size D and would work best for a . or  brannock. They have seen some moderate wear and have been resoled and refurbished once last year. They still have plenty of life and the current sole still has a good amount of mileage left as you can see.  Rancourt Chromepak Ranger Moc MTO E US album  Grailed LinkThese were custom made by Rancourt based off their ranger moc with oz super thick chromepak. I did a review on these here  These just arent really my style Ive realized I have red wing ankle boots that are similar and I usually just wear some derbies or pf flyers instead of these. So because of that these dont really have much wear and still havent been broken in yet! These are a size E and fit kind of large. They are a bit big on me and would probably fit a a .

5220719,0,t3_3mim3b,You can overcondition your boot. Leather is fibrous like paper. Its held together by the friction of the rough fibers. It also has a certain amount of oils and waxes impregnated in between the fibers. This helps with water repelance and gives leather its sort of reparative properties. If you add too much conditioner you tip to the other side of the scale. The addition of too much oil causes the fibers to slip. This can lead to excess creasing loose grain almost and stretching in places you dont want it. It can allow dirt and stuff to enter the leather too changing the coloration near permanently.,goodyearwelt,cvfae6d,2,t5_2w64o

I live in the southeast U.S. so its not necessarily known for its heavy snowfall but I do not have lots of money and Id actually like to be able to buy two pairs one brown and one black so economical is important although I understand a quality boot will cost some money.

5295390,0,t3_3ngd8i,The biggest problem with these boots besides the odd stiching and purely decorative zipper is that they are a pretty awkward mish mash of different styles. Generally speaking its incredibly difficult to combine elements of boots built for different purposes and come out with a coherent and stylish whole. The top half of these boots have styling cues of a work boot speed hooks fat cloth laces reinforced suede tongue etc. while the bottom half has the styling cues of a dress boot sleek almost pointed toe no cap etc.  To give you a better idea of what Im talking about the Wolverine  mile is something of a prototypical work boot albeit with vintage turn of the century actually leanings. Note how the toe is much rounder and larger than in something like an Allen Edmonds fifth street which is a pretty classically styled dress boot. Your boots are trying rather unsuccessfully to combine the two. Car design can be a helpful way to think about this. A dress boot is a porsche  while a work boot at least the vintage inspired ones youll see people fawning over here is a vintage range rover Now theyre both lovely to look at but they they achieve this with VERY different aesthetics. Heres what happens when you combine the two.  ,goodyearwelt,cvojppi,5,t5_2w64o

5457046,0,t3_3pt54y,The style I went with this time is a twist on the classic boondocker. I started with a oz oil tanned leather These went relatively quickly thanks to this old sewing machine I acquired. There was some growing pains to get it running properly as seen on the quarter of the left boot where the SPI is inconsistent and the stitches are crooked. Instead of redoing them I opted to keep going since boots are meant to be worn.The vamp is lined with soft black goatskin and the toe is unstructured The front  degrees is norvegese stitched then the vamp is folded out and stitched down to the midsole Nails and glue hold down the rear. Above the midsole not pictured is a steel shank thick leather shank cover and more nails. The heel cup is stitched directly to the insole similarly to the norvegese stitch but positioned underneath. You can see that stitching here The sole is a Dr Sole raw cord full sole that I cut down to a half sole. Too many soles in that sentence. The thickness of the half sole and leather midsole make it really hard to align the stitches. I need a longer awl blade so next time I can stitch from the top instead of from the bottom. This will make it so I can have a much neater row of stitching.The half sole transitions to a nd midsole in the rear. Then the leather heel stack and the matching raw cord heel are pressed on with X tons of force. ,goodyearwelt,cw96tnl,23,t5_2w64o

5550351,0,t3_3r20bu,I own Alden Indys  in Brown CXL and Viberg service boots in Black fatty calf. I previously owned OSB trench boots in Black CXL Dainite.I love my Indys. They have had zero quality problems. Their creasing seems normal for CXL. They are extremely comfortable due to their narrow width for my narrow feet thinner leather and the cork Nitrile soles.I was very happy with my OSBs when I first got them as reported here The quality was great. But as the leather softened up with wear they felt too wide on my narrow feet. I sold them and replaced them with the Vibergs. You can see my Viberg comments here The Vibergs are my favorite looking of these  boots but the Indys are still the most comfortable for my narrow feet.If you expect to wear your boots hard then I would recommend OSB or Viberg due to their thicker leather and Dainite soles. Either should last a very long time if properly cared for. If you will be treating them more gently and like the look then consider the Indys.

5558972,0,t3_3r9soz,Theyre finally here!Ordering ProcessThese are currently my first and so far only MTO. Because theyre in shell cordovan there wasnt an opportunity to do a GMTO. Interestingly the difference in price between Enzo and Carmina was  at the time due to Carminas  markup for a single MTO so going with Enzo was a no brainer.  It ended up being a little more than that after factoring the upcharge for the norvegese welt and double leather sole but not that much.I made the order back on April nd so these took a bit over  months to get in.  Originally I was told these would probably be around  months a bit longer than Enzos  month time due to the fact that theyre in shell and done with a norvegese welt.  However I think that was before Enzo built up quite a bit of backlog from Skoaks free MTO program.Im not quite sure if Skoak is going to be covering customs for these like theyre doing with new orders from the US store so well see how much I get hit with on that.SizingAnother reason Im really glad I ended up with Enzo for these is how well their lasts fit my feet.  At the time all I knew was that Enzo had a high instep which I thought would work well for me.  Over the summer I picked up a pair of suede wingtips in the same size and last MOD which fit perfectly so I definitely made the right decision here.These dont fit quite as well out of the box as the suede wingtips but thats just because the shell needs to get broken in a little bit as do the double leather soles which are quite stiff.  Initially I couldnt get the laces fully closed but after walking around a little bit they got better.  I think once theyre broken in the fit will be perfect just like my wingtips.ConstructionThese are built like tanks. Given that my other Enzos are more sleek I wasnt expecting how damn sturdy these came out.   But between the thickest shell cordovan Ive seen the double leather soles and  degree welt theyre very very solid. A great example of a longwing in my opinion.  Topped off with the norvegese welt I think theyre something really special.Another nice touch was that Enzo custom does the inscription in the heel so theyre Handmade for ltMy Name Heregt.  That might have made selling them a bit tough but I wont be needing to do that. It also seems like the stitching matches up much better with the wheeling than in some of my other pairs.  Its still not perfect like my Rosznyais but still very well done.  Another cool thing that they were able to do was have the stitching for the norvegese welt be black but the stitching in the welt be natural.  I thought a black stitching there with a more natural color welt would look off and Im really happy about how that came out.  Skoak wasnt quite sure if they could do it but it looks like they could.Other commentsUnfortunately it looks like these had a really rough trip over here.  The box was broken down two of the sides and I think being tossed around a lot ended up getting the shoes scuffed a bit from the shoe bags  which you can see in a lot of the photos.  Luckily none of it is too deep or bad as I was able to just rub with my finger a little bit and most of it would go away.  I think a little black cordovan shoe cream should take care of the rest.The Enzo shoe trees are also really cool.  Glad I got them to go with these.All in all I think these are quite stellar and Im really happy with how my first MTO came out.,goodyearwelt,cwm53o5,3,t5_2w64o

Those will fully dry your boots over night and will extend the boots life. Also use mink oil specifically and regularly to maintain the leather and help waterproof them. If you are looking for winter boots specifically I highly recommend the ice cutters. There are also new blacksmiths and iron rangers that have a more rugged sole that would be appropriate for what you need in the winter as well as every other month. Sick choice is also key.

5926408,0,t3_3wirjd,GD So Im in Boston this weekend and I stopped by NEOCs holiday party at the popup shop and also swung by yesterday for an hour or so. The party was pretty fun and yesterday I just hung around talking to Greg uNEOGreg and Ian Clegg Frank Cleggs son for a while. Hearing all about NEOCs roots dreams and potential plans. It really reinforced why I think NEOC is such a great company and gave me so much respect for Greg and what hes doing. We need to support the few craftsmanship based things and handmade things left in the world especially on our soil and Greg is pioneering one of them. Probably going to get something made for my birthday by them my girlfriend seemed to want to take the design reins for it and surprise me so I let her haha. Greg gave us his card and let us know to contact him when she gets her design together on our way out. Really really cool guys and an awesome businessbrand. We also talked a lot about leather in general and our favorite footwear brands. Which led to discussions on hand welting and Gregs couple forays into it. I of course let him know wed be glad to support him if they were to begin offering handwelted boots and shoes MTOs made in the USA as well as their normal Mocs in the future. Of course its a hugely time consuming process and a whole other shoe manufacturing process as well so well see what the future brings!All in all I had a great time just shooting the shit over at the Pop Up so if youre in Boston you should definitely pop in. Haha. PS uDeusis I was wearing your Vibergs that I bought off you.

If you were to do the basic minimum in shoe maintenance this would be the product to own. It also adds a light glowing shine after buffing. AE shoe cream is a hybrid of polish and conditioner. Should be good for covering scuffs and giving the shoe a more uniform look.  ,goodyearwelt,cymy90t,2,t5_2w64o

6533405,0,t1_czv2ire,Haha thanks man! And Im glad you have found my posts to be inspiring. I am but a humble hobbyist!Spenl is a little slow with getting orders through every now and then. Youll most likely have to pay up front on your first order but once youve successfully purchased from them one time they just ship the bill with the lasts the following times. Also ask them for the tracking number. Otherwise you wont get it and the lasts just show up after a couple of weeks.I actually have no idea what A. A. Crack charges for their hides. Id suggest you email them theyre friendly and helpful and tell them youre looking to make your first pair of shoes and have them suggest a decent upper leather for a first project. As such you probably dont want to splurge on something like Horween Latigo for roughly  a hide... Insole leather and sole bends are probably going to be what will be the most expensive for you. Leather amp Grindery has decent basic sole bends though.Material cost for one single pair of shoes will probably be around  but you will have to buy more of each leather than you will need for a single pair so that cost is not true to what you will spend starting up. And then there are the tools. Also closing the uppers is difficult without a proper post bed sewing machine so you might want to try a Carreducker kit if you dont want to hand stitch the uppers or try and figure out how to do it with a domestic sewing machine.,goodyearwelt,czv3u1w,1,t5_2w64o

6764340,0,t1_d0izw0d,Absolutely! First off I had some problems with these my first pair of welted boots. I got them on Amazon in a size . which is a half size down from normal as per many recommendations. I got them for  or so. Many other sites are really close to the MSRP of . When I got the boots they seemed a little on the tight side but I was willing to forgive that. I had to return them due to the right boot making an air puff sound when pressing the heal down. I figured there was a void in the cork never really figured out the cause. Since they were out of stock I got them in my true size of . This pair it just about perfect. There is some extra room near the front but I like that I can wear thicker socks when needed. Quality They seem very well made but that first pair had the annoying air puff and the second pair didnt have that issue but had other very small problems with the finish stray marks and such as well as more noticeable defects like one of the edges of exposed leather being damaged where the leather had split and lifted a bit on the edge. Couple other finishing problems which I would not expect to see from such a highly regarded boot maker but hey its handmade. BreakinNot bad at least for me. Feels like walking on a linoleum floor but it is getting better and better. It isnt intended to be a really comfortable shoe so no surprises there. Value Yet to be seen I think I got a very nicely made shoe which should last a long time. It is still a lot of money for a pair of Chukkas. The lower end market is very competitive and you can get a good pair of Chukkas for  very easily. These have a pretty one of a kind classic look to them and they feel like a finely crafted versatile boot. I am happy with what I paid but if they do not hold up for a few years I think it would be a bit of a let down. Color and Finish I wasnt sure which color I should pick as they all seemed to have pluses and minuses. Copper Rough and Tough has been nice though. The pair I returned had a more brown color to this pairs dark orange. I like the look and it is breaking in to be rustic and refined. Not sure how leather treatments will react to the finish though. The crepe sole is going to be tough to keep clean but it will look good clean or dirty. Conclusions after a weekHappy I got these.

Maybe but one of the other band disbanded with total drama and the other band got their vocalist and bassist ODd. Well we might be able to avoid those things but who knows?

7107866,0,t1_d1ly0j6,I see what youre saying and Im not going to say who is right and who is wrong here but there are some things to keep in mind here.First is that designs are fairly standard. People have been making footwear for thousands of years. This particular design is recognizable but not unique.If Viberg wanted it to be unique theyd have commissioned an exclusive sole not used an off the shelf outsole. Wedge soles arent novel. Service boots arent novel. I think for Viberg to think that their designs and use of leather are theirs alone to use is incredibly naive and honestly I dont think they publicly feel this way. I think Brett just gets frustrated the way anyone does. I dont think what the Indonesian makers do is wrong although one of them is offputting to me Sagara maybe?. You cant refer to your lasts and designs as Viberg or Red Wing.I dont see a problem paying homage to a brand past or present but directly invoking them or outright counterfeiting is another matter.Having said that there are a few reasons why some are proTruman and less favorable to Indonesian brands.A big element here is quality. People feel confident in the quality and service Vince offers. The Indonesian brands can be really hit or miss generally fine though. Another is pride and patriotism. It may be lame but some would buy Truman over Viberg not because of cost but because they want to buy American. This contributes to why they feel cold on Asian brands making heritage or homage products.,goodyearwelt,d1m1wrm,17,t5_2w64o

7156014,0,t1_d1rifxj,Another thing that you want to remember is that as you initially wear GYW shoes or boots a break in occurs. Leather will tend to stretch width wise but not length wise. Also your foot will start to settle in the footbed which is typically made from cork. As these things occur the shoe or boot will have even more room. So in actuality its better to start off a bit snug and not tight than to begin with something already to roomy to begin with. So here again make sure you have a bit of space between your largest toe and the end of the boot by about a thumb nail but width wise it should be a bit snug from the get go.,goodyearwelt,d1rkhib,1,t5_2w64o

Or was this to another professional such as yourself?So I will converse with the wife when she returns from training  she may want a crack at something from this. Whether it is within my price point is a different question entirely?Couple of thoughtsquestions from my side How well does it bend  aka would it work as a lanyard that was folded in half  or is it a bit too brittle for that without a backing? I ask because it is not a consistent density across so it comes with known failuretearing points. The question is whether those points are of a sufficient durability. For a mens wallet  would think either a bifold  interior being a cordovan could make it pop and be very distinctive. Alternatively for a more subdued look Stonewall or safeguard. I do think that this could see definite use as a womens clutch  basically one of those large envelope clutches from a single piece.

7312817,0,t3_4fjuhh,Heres the albumIve loved the look of Dublin leather for a while and was itching for a pair of boots in them so when Truman restocked natural Dublin I decided to jump in and get a pair. Now I kind of wish I had waited for the brown horsehide now but thats a different matter.Getting them I never had cause to talk to Vince since the ordering process was super easy. I stayed pretty close a standard makeup just dropped the pull tab and went with a commando sole. The original post promised  to  weeks and they shipped at  weeks on the dot and arrived a couple of days later.Buildaesthetics I cant find anything to fault constructionwise. As others have said Truman does great work and the boot feels like a tank. All the stitching is clean and precise and leather quality is great. The natural Dublin is lighter than Id expected but shows really cool character and highslows in color out of the box. Seems like this is a leather that really benefits from aging and wear to get the kind of look that I loved. There were some small scratch marksnicks but seems like thats expected with Dublin and they dont take away from the look. The commando sole is nice with more tread depth than I was expecting.Fit I sized down a halfsize to . as I did with Viberg  s which I wouldnt recommend. I was surprised how much more compact Trumans last is compared to the . I liked it in that it looks sleeker than many workboots kind of like Ks but didnt work out for me fitwise. The toe box is much shorter and the boot overall is narrower. Im fine on length but only squeezed into the right boot using thin socks whereas I need thick socks for the s. I prefer thick socks so will have to return or send them back to Truman to get stretched to E width. If anyone experienced a similar issue with Trumans Id love to hear how it went for you.Bottom line These are great boots built incredibly well and they look sharp. Hoping I can sort out the size issues soon and start wearing them. ,goodyearwelt,d29f1ey,3,t5_2w64o

Ive never tried conditioning it for the reasons you gave I think the surface is somehow rubberized and thus wont take up any oils or age particularly well. My creases are somewhat pitted too which I think is from the rubber cracking off.Thats a good idea about reaching out to Buttero. I got them on sale online from Carson Street Clothiers for  retail near  but that doesnt really excuse the rather poor quality from a brand like Buttero which people here seem to think is fairly decent.,goodyearwelt,d2x1j6b,1,t5_2w64o

7761139,0,t1_d3od11q,Last time I had this type of discussion it was with someone who lacked experience with the particular subject we were discussing. It sounds like we have the same thing going on here as well. Kind of hard to have this type of discussion when we are entering it at a different level of understanding and experience. Especially when the one with no or little experience initially claims that the person with more experience is giving bad advice. Often this advice with this particular shoe works but not always. Of course my advice wont work for everybody. Thats evident just look at the rest of this thread. In fact at times thats why I use a disclaimer. But Im human sometimes I forget to use the disclaimer. People here often buy shoes without trying them on. Not the advice I would give if all things were equal. The problem with these particular shoes is even if you do that the leather will tend to stretch to the point were you can no longer wear them. Unfortunately this happens on one of the types of shoes where everything needs to be almost just right to wear them loafers. This is not your typical shoe and this type of leather does not hold its original shape very well so results are mixed.,goodyearwelt,d3odqjb,1,t5_2w64o

The work environment is great and the pay is fine for an interim job so Im happy. Wednesday Family came in and thats... always interesting. Ive always felt a bit detached from nonimmediate family so it kind of pains me to spend multiple days with them on end and this time theyre staying for about  weeks. Thursday wasnt bad because I had about half a days worth of reprieve but today was terrible. The  weeks that theyll be here might hurt quite a bit if I dont find a way to escape!Thursday Tried something called sugarbacon at a place named in kind that only contained sugar in the BBQ sauce on top. Color me disappointed. Met ubankingoil to obtain the vibergs he picked up for me at the sample sale and taking this picture to commemorate the occasion. I am very happy with the pickups and cant wait to take them out for a spin! I am also now in possession of a pair of socks and tshirt that he left in one of the boots for transportation and am using this post to let him know muhahahaha  Attended an informal latte art competition hosted by a super secret society group of local baristas to watch and learn the way of the barista. Didnt stay long as the place was quite crowded and I didnt REALLY know anyone.Friday Found an amazing sake that Ive been looking for for quite some time now. My SO and I first tried it at a sushi restaurant and have been searching for it ever since. Super happy about that and already had about half the bottle with her after dinner. Found a hidden local coffee roaster that was really chill. They donate some of the proceeds to local charities and offer quite a lot of variety which is A in my book. I talked the ear off an employee despite them admitting that their boss was the one with the extensive coffee knowledge. I anticipate multiple visits and discussions in the future!I intend to lurk in the coming weeks with the new job and family so perhaps this is the last large post for a bit. I have some first impressions in the works but I need to take more pictures and get around to finishing one more out and I am willing to bet that laziness will most often prevail.I believe that is all.

Aside from the fact that they are Oxblood style brogues I am really fond of the thick braided welt. I think thats part of the welt isnt it? Or does it just sit on top of the welt?  And thus my question what kind of welt is it? This morning I only knew about Goodyear Welts. Now I have learned about Norwegian Welts and other types but my searching hasnt turned up anything quite like this one.

8427431,0,t3_4v2rvf,There are many factors that play into the price of a shoe one of them being the way they cut the leather to make the shoe.With the exact same hide one brand could make  pairs of shoes while another brand makes only . This is because leather comes from an animal so leather coming from the belly area will be different from leather coming from the back area. Every single area has its own characteristic. A pricier company will carefully cut the leather as to only use the best part of the hide for whatever part of the shoe they make. Additionally hides will have some problem areas such as scratches loose grain stretch marks etc that pricier companies will cut around. Therefore a company like OSB might waste a lot more leather than TBC but their product will ultimately look better and last longer.Apart from the way the leather is cut there are many more factors going into the cost of the shoes. The materials for the other parts may be more expensive production may be more labor intensive employees might be higher paid etc. ,goodyearwelt,d5uyxtf,3,t5_2w64o

8615972,0,t1_d6ijn5i,Since the mohawk is fairly textured you could use a spray conditioner like Lexols so you dont have to physically rub something onto the leather. You could also spray the inside of the boot to condition them if youd prefer just because the inside is the smooth grain part of the leather. As for the belt since the boot is fairly variable in colour you could pick out a brown shade that stands out to you and find a belt in that colour?

9623701,0,t3_5cq1kw,Hi guys! I may be traveling to Europe in December and am thinking of a good pair of shoes to bring with. I like to travel light aka just a duffel and smart casual usually bring with me button ups and outlier slim dungarees or futureworks so Id like shoes that go with that wardrobe more so because Id be visiting my gfs family during the holidays so dont wanna look too shabby haha. Since I travel light and for two weeks at most I usually violate the more than one pair of shoes so you can let one pair rest every day principle of good shoe care and I like to bring with me shoes that will be appropriate to dress up or down but also do alright with inclement weather and airports and planes early on I discovered that big chunky boots with tall soles may make you feel safe in the snow but theyre the most uncomfortable and heavy shoe when stuck on a plane for ten hours!During the spring I brought a pair of timberland brogue derbies that were super comfortable and weatherproof but were a bit more slippery than Id like the sole was sortofcommandolooking but definitely not good on grip. Previously Ive traveled with chukkas and jodhpurs that did alright but I moved countries so those shoes are far away and probably worn by one of my siblings haha Ive never done chelseas and am finally willing to give them a chance too!I have a budget that can go up to  for a good prospect but since I actually have pretty good  though too tall and heavy  boots for the upcoming winter here in the city Id rather just get a good looking midrange shoe I can just rough up when traveling if theres something in the lt range that sounds good that would be way more financially responsible!I dress a lot in black and dark grays and blues so something in charcoal or black would be pretty versatile I think. For reference Ive been considering the following Common projects suede chelsea Not a fan of the external branding or the crepe sole would like to know how foolish it is to resort to such a sole for an allpurpose early winter shoe. Feit military handsewn chelsea I dont know how Id make this shoe work in my wardrobe really but I kinda like feits offerings this season this one has cozylooking suede and a commando sole. I own their military hikers in black and theyre definitely pretty comfy and robust despite the brands low GYWclout p  End x Trickers Club sole burton brogue Im a sucker for brogues and I find low shoes way less constricting when stuck in planes and trains though its definitely less protective too. Not sure if a dainite sole is good for Germany in December if its anything like NYC in Frankfurt maybe snow wont be too crazy yet? END x Trickers Ellis boot Does this even actually work like a chelsea?? It looks pretty darn crazy which I like and I know it may be less comfy than my other options but if its easy to take on and off and will actually withstand travel this is my favorite thus far. Trickers Henry Black Elastic Brogue Boot Another interesting looking shoe from Trickers does anyone have experience buying directly from them and shipping to the US?

In America it is the Blucher and in the UK it is the Derby or less often the Gibson.gtA Derby is defined by the way the lacing and eyelets close the shoe. The closing panels are sewn on top of the vamp giving the shoe a more solid appearance and more room for the higher instep.gtBecause the facings are on top of the vamp there is added height and bulk to the shoe which makes it a good platform for a more rugged style. This is why we often team the derby with a country design such as those worn for country pursuits or rambling walks.From the above theres probably also an America vs UK difference in definition,goodyearwelt,dajw5dw,1,t5_2w64o

10102644,0,t1_dbo2p4q,I havent owned my pair with taps long enough to really say one way or another but it does seem like they keep the toe looking nicer since there is no wear on the toes. I think most people find them to be a good investment. It will also depend on the cobbler you use as most local cobblers arent skilled enough to put flush metal taps on. You can get plastic taps which wont last as long and wont be set into the sole. But even rubber or plastic taps will help extend the life of your soles. Im not sure about adding them to already worn pairs. It probably will depend on how worn the toe is although I have heard of a skilled cobbler building back the toe with some leather when applying taps.

Also the leather on the inside of the back of the shaft has gotten caught on my heel when pulling on and off so that the leather has stretched out  this makes it even hard to slide my heel passed since it pulls the excess leather along with it.

10582202,0,t3_5riewn,I just received my first pairs of Meermin shoes  FINALLY. I believe I paid for these earlymid December. Here are some initial pics as well as a bonus pic of my GYW corner.I am no expert in shoes. My previous GYW experience is limited to Allen Edmonds Red Wings Wolverine and a pair of Thursday Boots I impulsivelyand regretfully purchased.With that said my first impressions are very positive. For the price these pairs seem to have much better quality control than AE both firsts and seconds. When I first purchased my AE shoes I was sort of disappointed with the quality control of my first pairs. AE is highly recommended on this subreddit as well as SF. Prior Ive only had experience with mall brand dress shoes. I figured maybe these sort of defects were normal and I just had to lower my standards and look at the bigger picture.I dont really think Ill be buying any more AE shoes  for the price Meermin seems to be better quality my opinionI am D in dalton and strand. I purchased UK in all the Meermin shoes and they all fit. I have to say my foot fits the Elton last very well  much comfier than the  last from AE for me. I would really like to try Carmina next and see how the quality of those compare.,goodyearwelt,dd7h0r2,6,t5_2w64o

Thursday Boot is in a very low price range while carrying a style that appeals to a lot of people and its not like their product is going to disintegrate in a couple months. I think if you like the styling and are under that budget constraint you should get them. Alternative may be the J Crew Kenton cap toe boot. I saw them on sale for  CAD this summer.

Is your office more casual or not? The IR is definitely a more casual boot for the office IMO. Beckmans can be shined up and look good albeit the toe box will give away that its a boot vs shoe not sure how stringent your office dress code is.Lastly the Blacksmith is a good middle ground between the two. It has the mini lugs like the black IR speed hooks like the IR Rolled top like the Beckman and plain toe like the Beckman. It does not have a leather mid sole and commando sole like the beckman which is a big draw to those boots but neither does the IR so maybe thats not something youre considering?

11008921,0,t1_defp21a,I spent several years on the product side so you dont sound jaded at all. Biometrics are only good as a second factor IMHO and there are greater and lesser implementations.  There are matchonsensor MoC sensors for PCs where the complexityminutiaeridge data i.e. not an acutal fingerprint is never outside the sensor and thus never in the clear to be captured.  NonMoC sensors that are either hardware assisted meaning that information is transported outside the sensor often encrypted but still transported or software assisted which is even less secure.  But an MoC implementation with a strong password or pin is awfully secure especially a password with decent complexity rules.  There are plenty of consumergrade sensors that are just for convenience and are only marginally secure in the enterprisecorporate sense.,goodyearwelt,deftwpt,1,t5_2w64o

11273562,0,t1_df8dnub,Hi!So I just bought a pair of RM Williams Comfort Craftsman in Black. I still havent worn them yet because they costed so much a little bit over  to buy them retail let me know if this is normal or not. They seemed really comfortable to put on in the store and I mostly bought these so I could wear something comfortable.Im wondering if I should wear these all the time or like wear them even at work? I dunno maybe the amount I paid for them is having me think that I should wear them in fancy scenarios. That being said Id love to have a brown version and Im contemplating buying chestnut pair for that reason. Thoughts?I literally just found this subreddit so forgive me if I dont use any of the lingo but do you find yourself missing other types of boots  shoes that look maybe a tad bit more rugged or like traditional cap toe Allen Edmonds type shoes?Also Im like paralyzed because I know the RM Williams comfort wise beat out so many other shoes and I wear these shoes doing a lot of walking possibly jogging in NYC so Im wondering if the comfort will stack up to the RM Williams enough that Id want to even wear them.
