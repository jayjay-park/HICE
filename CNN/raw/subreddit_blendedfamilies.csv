Feel free to call his bluff if he threatens to go to court.Although from past personal experience... months is very quick to be back into a relationship and certain about its future enough to introduce the kids.  I would strongly encourage you to hold off for another  months before you introduce the kids to that situation.  They get attached too and if this relationship tubes out they get to process yet another loss.  Take your time date to establish trust.  ,blendedfamilies,cyzejqh,2,t5_34na3

Its hard enough to get on your feet and not get jaded by how hard life can be if you dont have people you can count on to help you when things get tough. Does he not want any relationship with her? Do they do anything fun together even share a joke? I think a ride to work before the buses run is a pretty reasonable request especially with gas money. It sounds like he just doesnt care and thats pretty sad.,blendedfamilies,d44s2np,2,t5_34na3
