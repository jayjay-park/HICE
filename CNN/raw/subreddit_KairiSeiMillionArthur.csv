7738278,0,t3_4kpcje,on c play  priority attacks these cards need to buff an offensive stat or enchant you. you should chain light with ur remaining cost if you cant do it with ur  cards. the usual method is shabi or pana water and dark fp enchants followed by sophie u need to play them in this order. if you dont have sophie the alternative is using genderbend dietrich UR max card from one of the sp key dungeons. if you dont have sophie and are worried that dietrich will pull down your hp or something you can just chain light with a debuff card like soccer fionare and use a buff with higher hp like loli scaha,KairiSeiMillionArthur,d3lsayp,1,t5_3b0c9

Thief is hard if you didnt roll many thief cards in the gacha. There arent as many event thief cards compare to the other .I would roll the  gacha until you hit  gems and stop dont ever waste your gems on  gem rolls. Depending on what cards you get for the gacha I would start with that class like if you got a lot of warrior cards,KairiSeiMillionArthur,d3xnwgs,1,t5_3b0c9
