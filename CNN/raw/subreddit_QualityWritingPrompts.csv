3266833,0,t3_2wx1j4,You know you think this is a Barbie doll how they hell is a Barbie doll going to scare you.Listen I know this one guy hes a collector. He like well toys. Hes got Optimus prime and a Millennium Falcon. Like the real stuff from the set. Thing is he likes women a lot. Dresses them up all cosplay and shit. Real weird though. The thing is I clean up. Ive seen death a thousand times and carry bleach and lime with me. Hes just a job. But its real weird like the kid never grew up from five. Race Car bed and a dead women. And by dead I mean shes ripped apart blood everywhere inside the car. The rest of the room around the bed was clean spick and span. But I saw the shelf with the one Barbie doll the nurse bent over looking at her. So I take the pieces he had bent everything weird cuts bruises he tried to switch an arm and leg can you believe that he was horrible tailor. Some guys he pays right though I havent forgiven myself for what Ive done for a lot money. So how can a Barbie doll scare you? When your looking it in the face. Five days later here I am tucked into a race car bed staring at a nurse the drug are wearing off I dont want to scream. ,QualityWritingPrompts,cp0n933,1,t5_373e4
