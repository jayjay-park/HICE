1681624,0,t1_cjqo3m4,No worries whatsoever. You are great and this feedback is really helpful. Were still building up the tools and a userbase around the selfservice ad system.  I think the sponsored headline is a solid ad unit on reddit and the bones are there. We need to keep hearing from folks like you about what we can do better. This might not be the feature that meets your particular needs. The interest audience targeting is finer grained than the frontpage. We see advertisers target the frontpage that just dont know how to find targets any other way. reddit is confusing with more than  active subreddits. This is one way to help people. Its not the only way and its not the only way were planning on solving this problem. This is v of this feature. We want to improve reporting on reddit ads as well. Your suggestions are definitely in line with what weve got on the roadmap. gt In general I want all the metrics I can have. Options for CPC CPM CTR Comments Votes any other ROIfocused metrics which would typically require conversion tracking although bigger advertisers probably have their own setup.Can you spend a second sharing with me how you use these to evaluate success? It may be redundant and may sound like a stupid question but its something I want to not make any assumptions around.gt Also Im a RES user and I dont recall what the differences are in the main Reddit UI but is there a way to make all images in posts display inline? I realized as I was reading through the HowTo with RES that it would be a TON of images to have to click back and forth on. I get why you do it for the main Reddit site but your official posts like this could benefit from implementing that by default for everyone. If I didnt use RES that strikes me as being a headache to read through.This. Also something were thinking about as the fullpage ad  similar to taking out a full page ad in the print edition of The New York Times. I think selfposts or reddit content ads can be really powerful. There is so much that we could do here. Again though weve got to figure out how to measure the value of these posts. Why Im really curious about how you measure ROI or use the metrics provided for you and why Im asking so many questions. ,selfserve,cjr4qwi,1,t5_2rcph

6239993,0,t3_411clb,rpermaculture is a relatively small subreddit so the impressions tend to get booked quickly. This is going to be a lot easier soon because were so close to launching an ads auction. So rpermaculture ads would go to the highest bidder instead of the current platform system of firstcomefirstserve. Were planning on launching auction this quarter.,selfserve,cyyx4hg,1,t5_2rcph
6538210,0,t1_czvk6xl,Wait you work for Reddit? that makes more sense. Can we not turn this feature onoff in a campaign? I think its a neat addition but could hurt in some niche cases.,selfserve,czvlr78,1,t5_2rcph

8243351,0,t3_4s5kht,Hi GrandsonaccountYou can add subreddits to your campaign by editing a live campaign. Navigate to your campaign dashboard and you should see a blue edit button on your campaign. You can then add additional subreddits change your enddate or a number of other changes. Please note When editing a campaign your ad will need to be reapproved. This can take up to  hours if done outside of business hours. Let me know if you have any other questions. BestKHANNNNN,selfserve,d57z375,2,t5_2rcph
9199595,0,t3_55urmu,HiThis can happen if you are using an ad blocker. Do you have AdBlock on? Thats probably it! If you are please turn it off or whitelist reddit.com to prevent this issue. ,selfserve,d8i47c1,2,t5_2rcph
