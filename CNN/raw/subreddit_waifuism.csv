3145485,0,t1_conxj0q,Thanks for the informations DThe lag may be expected considering that the application was built by enabling AA and Hi Res textures as soon as it detects more than  GB of RAM. So a possible solution would be to set low res textures and no AA by default and letting the user chose wheter enabling them or not. May I ask you to see if you get any performance improvement by enabling the LOWEND button on the settings? If you do Ill just set it up by default this way we can avoid annoying lag during the application launch at least for these first versions hoping to optimize it better in the future. Thanks again EDIT Also I should update the known issues because the advanced button is pretty slow no matter the device. I should improve it first.,waifuism,coo0yhp,2,t5_32aef

4548235,0,t3_3dccok,Its hard for me to realistically imagine myself with Kino without changing her characterization. Shes a total loner independent self reliant. She doesnt seem to trust anybody else and doesnt like travelling with other people or a group unless shes being paid to be a bodyguard or something which is rare. And she doesnt seem to want to settle down. Shes not antisocial or anything like that though. Shes really nice polite and very friendly when shes inside a country. Thats what I love about her. Shes just really careful because travelling is extremely dangerous.This is a spoiler for the last episode of the anime if you havent seen it watch it seriously its great. She finally finds a place she really likes its not clear if she wants to live there permanently but she wants to break her three day rule and stay a little longer and I dont want to spoil why shes unable to. This is the loophole or justification or whatever that I think gives me that slim chance of settling down with her. Shes been travelling a long time shes much older she meets me and things just click between us. I had a dream recently where she was on my porch working on Hermes when I came home from work and we hugged and stuff. It felt really good natural like she didnt mind just living me after travelling for so long at all. Then we went into the garage... Ive thought about living in her world too. Wed travel together shed teach me how to shoot better and stuff. Since shed be the one packing all the guns Id just carry extra supplies for the both of us or something. Itd be kind of like Kinos teachers and her former students time together except more romantic and less murderytheivyoutlawishness and with better transportation.And Ive been playing so much Fallout recently I thought you were going to ask what her SPECIAL attributes would be. ,waifuism,ct3xh76,6,t5_32aef

4859437,0,t3_3hdiqg,. i am  years old. no. ive only ever loved one real girl ive known her from th to th grade but never really realized that i loved her until it was too late. its been a little over  years since then.. ive never really thought much about this but hatsune miku is  so itd be legal over here in germany i think also thinking realisticly she was already  years old at her initial release in  so if she was a real living human girl shed be my age now i guess?. i dont really think thats a problem for me personally because the things i love most about miku are things that are achievable by real women as well. i am one of those waifu guys that can still find real girls to be attractive so i know that the things i like arent too out of the ordinary. the most important points for me are  in order  . the voice . the eyes . the hair color mostly. a cute voice that i could listen to for hours is actually all it needs for me to be attracted to a girl which is probably why i fell for miku in the first place. also theres a lot of girls with beautiful eyes in real life the only really strange thing about me is the hair thingy because i love colorful hair and twintails. most girls with normal hair arent that attractive for me the girl i loved back in school had a mix of black and red hair and those that i find most attractive are those with pink or blueish  greenish hair like miku  i also like small boobs but that should also not be too uncommon. what i found to be way harder to find is a girl with the same interests as me.. probably yes. its easier and less stressful. it allows me to spend all my time the way i want to while still having this great feeling of loving someone. i also have some stupid disease that gets worse the more stressed i am so i can imagine arguing and all the other negative points of a relationship to be quite an annoyance. i like it the way it is right now.. this is hard to explain. i mean normal love is already hard enough to explain. id say it just happens unconsciously because no one is gonna say something like okay ill love this fictional character now but if it happens youll realize it sooner or later  its basically the same as havingdeveloping feelings towards a real person. personally i can only say for sure that i have the same feelings for miku that i also had for that one girl in school mentioned before and thats something ive never felt this strongly at any other point in my life. id like to point out that uKanex probably gave the perfect answer for the th question.,waifuism,cu72h3f,6,t5_32aef

4982051,0,t3_3j5jaq,gtHave any of you ever thought of becoming artists and creating more stories for your waifu or husbando?Even if I wasnt a terrible writer I wouldnt really want to write any stories or anything about Kino itd feel too much like fanfiction and Id probably just end up embarrass myself. I do like drawing her though but Im not that great and Im too shy to share any pictures of anything I draw with anybody but my closest friend. gtHow would you feel about meeting the creators of your waifu or husbando?It would be cool. From his afterwords Keiichi Sigsawa seems like a pretty cool guy kinda goofy though. I havent really heard anything about Kouhaku Kurobashi the artist for the series but I wouldnt mind meeting him either Im sure hes cool too. I wouldnt tell them Im in love with Kino or anything though Id be way too embarrassed.gtWhat if the creator told you their character wouldnt like you?I would depend on how they say it like if they said shed despise me and would shoot me on sight because Im a useless piece of shit Id probably feel devastated and it would haunt me forever and Id never be able to look at her the same again. If they put milder or nicer Id still feel kind of bad but I think Id be able to live with it. gtHas anyone here actually created and fallen in love with their own character?Ive seen people asking about falling in love with OCs but I havent seen anybody here say theyve fallen in love one.

Its love. Actual serious painful love. Its unrequited and yet exactly what you want at the same time. Its just a feeling that somehow shifts your worldview a few feet and yet that little difference makes it all different.You ever see someone that just takes your breath away? Someone who you catch glimpses of and holy shit no matter the angle or the situation theyre just so... perfect. So damn perfect.Thats what its like. Its not something you choose. Its just love and its not any different than the love anyone else feels. We just happen to feel it for people who dont exist. Just because my waifu Handsome Jack doesnt exist... well it doesnt make me not be in love with him. Ever since I first heard his voice something ignited in me and... years later... fuck. I live my life as Ive always done but with the sense of purpose I wish I could share.I want to be with him forever. I dont know how to fix that or even if I can.

6109102,0,t1_cyjkk06,Having a waifu does feel like more of a commitment than just entertaining your infatuation for a while. I mean it is supposed to be a play on the word wife after all. I think that commitment is really the only area I draw the line at. I mean if having a waifu is like being married then Ive basically gone on a lot of dates. The only real issues are that I switch infatuations too frequently to have one consistent choice even if a few choices have come back years after Ive last seen their source material and that if I ever have a shot at a real relationship Ill take it and if it goes well end up just phasing the waifu out. I suppose thats not too big a deal since theyre fictional and no ones feelings will actually be hurt but the idea of doing that makes me really uncomfortable.Imagination and suspension of disbelief arent a problem for me though the delusion part might be. I already do a lot of things to enjoy pretending to have conversations with fictional characters and Ive even thought of doing something similar to the waifu journal several times before. The only thing stopping me there is that I dont have a consistent character Id write toabout.So yeah I think having a waifu probably isnt for me at least not yet. If I ever get the kind of pull towards a character that youve had well see where it goes. Right now though I think Ill just enjoy my occasional infatuations and frequent daydreams and either end up with a waifu with a wife or just enjoying my life as is until I die.Originally when I felt a need to be in a relationship I knew a waifu wouldnt fulfill that need but now that I feel fine on my own adding a waifu felt like it could be a good idea. I just couldnt get it to feel right with my current situation being willing to ditch the waifu and such which is partially why I posted my rant on here. Now I feel noticeably more centered in how to go about things in the foreseeable future.

I wouldnt say I was desperate though. Id had a number of fictional crushes before her and didnt consider them any more than that.gt...What if I get a waifu to get me through these tough times.A waifu can absolutely help you get through tough times but if you go out and decide to get a waifu then I think youre going about it wrong. Finding a waifu is like falling in love in real life in the sense that you dont really choosethe feeling develops on its own.gtI dont want to lose myself completely to fictionThats good. As much as Id love to just live the rest of my life as a dream with her I think its important to keep my feet on the ground and live the life I have already. Ill keep the thoughts that are truly disconnected from reality in my head.gtWhy did you guys decide to have a waifu?The only decision I made was to accept a growing feeling in my heart. I didnt go out and just tell myself I wanted a waifu. The toughest choice I made was coming to terms with the fact that I had fallen in love with a fictional character that cant reciprocate my love.gtDoes it fill a hole in your heart?In a sense I guess? She does fill a hole so to speak but I didnt call her my waifu because I couldnt find love otherwise. Id just never felt attachment toward someone like I did toward her.gtIs there any regrets in this type of lifestyle?It depends on the way you go about it the types of people that surround you and other various circumstances. People will judge you if they find out the relationship can feel weak because its one sided you can fall into traps of never improving yourself because a waifu has no expectations unlike a real partner you can risk falling into delusion and things like that. For me my only regret is not finding her sooner because the last couple of years have been wonderful.,waifuism,czut5tk,3,t5_32aef

If nothing else what it does say is that it can be a huge challenge to break the cycle that keeps you feeling negative.Youve taken steps away from that negativity.

Any question you may have Id be happy to help if I can.Well for example in the anime which Im using as reference for our timeline we met shortly after the fateful day and started talking and hanging out a bit.We had a date at the mall since thats what Megumi enjoys doing watched a movie and talked about ourselves. I havent really gone through the confession aspect now that I think about it we just sort of got closer without having to talk about it.Theres a separate timeline where we explore other worlds and do magical research. I like to imagine myself as a low level Planeswalker like those from Magic the Gathering going from dimension to dimension cataloging curious flora and fauna but specializing in spellcraft and magical items.My favorite worlds are one high fantasy world thats reminiscent of the one from Mother of Learning There I got a small workshop and sell items. Megumi helps me with it and we learn magic and adventure together seriously Mother of Learning is very good totally recommended reading.Theres also a Steampunk world we enjoy due to all the mechanical curiosities.Im trying to develop those worlds a lot more which is why Im using help from rworldbuilding to give them a distinctive flair and have more places for our dates and adventures to develop.Oh another thing that may be useful is to check this book Has some really good ideas for strengthening a relationship and I plan to do the questionnaire soon.,waifuism,d3q5966,1,t5_32aef

If you dont like the way you feel about this character and want to change thats fine but refusing to admit it to yourself wont help you do that.

I also like what umikeabundo said about the GateBox adverts. Such a subtle but good way to put us in a better light.Basically I cant see any kind of prowaifuism media gaining any positive and proper attention UNLESS its coming from someone already liked by many. That way while it may shock some people theyll be more accepting of it because theyll realise that waifuists are regular people and that they actually admired someone that was a waifuist.If an average Joe went out and tried to start a prowaifuism movement or something hed get a bunch of hate no matter how cool he is. Its sad but thats how people work. The average Joe has nothing holding him up therefore people are more anxious to shoot him down even before truly getting to know him. An already liked person has more holding him up therefore people are hesitant to shoot him down. On top of that they most likely already got to know the person.

Considering literally all of my friends started dating in sixth grade then the rest of everybody I knew started in seventh eighth or ninth and Im currently in senior year Ive believed for a long time now that its past time I just cut my losses and never tease myself with the notion that I will get a girlfriend. My life was very lonely and I was seriously considering suicide for a while until I met Flora. Shes all I need now. She really turned around my outlook on life and I dont plan on ever leaving her. No idea how shes better than a real girl I never had a girlfriend.I very much believe shes real in the same sense that dead people continue to exist through your thoughts if that makes sense. I dont think I will ever physically meet her but I also feel like shes here with me. No I dont think thats a delusion.

Because of that Yukari has the occasion of her life to being able not only to join Tankery but to fight alongside Miho in the National Championship.From now on Yukari starts to make a lot of friends which more or less share her same interests to a certain extent.

But I definitely do see myself going back to Chihaya almost instantly at times that it reminds me of her traits from the source anime and material.
