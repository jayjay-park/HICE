Philip French of The Observer said Grant has the occasional good line or at least he makes a few of them seem funny but the film limps along like someone trying to tap dance in flippers. The film opened on February   in the United Kingdom and Ireland and ranked  at the box office grossing . million in its first weekend. It was released on  screens in the United States and Canada on February  and grossed  on its opening weekend ranking  at the box office behind Ghost Rider Bridge to Terabithia and Norbit. It eventually grossed  in the US and Canada and  in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of .He is a melody man not a lyricist. His lyricist from his old band Pop! In walks Sophie Fisher played with charm by the eversweet Drew Barrymore. She s Alex s temporary plant watering person and not a very good one with a penchant for delivering peppy lyrics under her breath. Despite the scorn of fillin wordsmith Greg Antonsky Alex takes a liking to her style.The film sails along never letting down as they work together and discover each other. I ve seen Music and Lyrics twice and liked it even better the second time. The supporting cast with Brad Garrett as Alex s tortured manager Kristen Johnston as Sophie s neuroticdriven older sister and Haley Bennett as Cora Corman the new pop sensation are all terrific. The songs are evocative of another age and work well in support of the film. But it is really the chemistry between Grant and Barrymore that wins the viewer over.Grant is at his best when he allows a hard glint of caddish narcissism to peek through his easy flirtatiousness something he did in About a Boy and American Dreamz. Cheery Alex Fletcher lives comfortably in Manhattan off the residuals from his  s pop success and reprising his hits at school reunions theme parks and state fairs. A song that could maybe bring him back to prominence after twenty years of playing store openings amusement parks and nostalgia concerts. It aims to be a fun romantic sweet comedy of a man meeting a woman and falling in love with a poke at pop culture.The album also reached  on the Australian Albums Chart Brad Garrett as Chris Riley Get music and listen to the latest songs from your favorite artists for FREE.

Over the next few days they grow closer while writing the words and music together much to the delight of Sophie s older sister Rhonda Kristen Johnston a huge fan of Alex..   ,fountainsofwayne,cxdiinh,1,t5_2xlmt
