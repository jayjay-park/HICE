9688724,0,t3_5d0r8i,There is some new Circuitry drawings which are really nice and Fred did a lot of cleanup and updating and such. But the vast majority is what was in books . So if youre only looking for lots of new content maybe not. It is a really nicely put together omnibus though  seriously thick and heavy with content. I bought one even though I already had books  and Im glad I did.,megatokyo,da7c9mw,2,t5_2xr7b
