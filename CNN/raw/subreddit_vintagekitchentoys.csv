Theyre out of my price range one sold for  on Ebay a few months back but I do live in a heavy agingretired people area so one day running across one is not completely implausible.

It makes contact with the bottom of the bowl and allows it to turn when the mixer is on.  So the inside beater is the square cross shape they dont have the vinyl buttons.  The other is the outside that follows the shape of the bowl it slightly curves inward. ,vintagekitchentoys,csco7cq,6,t5_31qif
