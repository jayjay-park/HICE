If you plan on using them for the next few years as an alternative to a tent Id say go for it. But I havent really looked too much in to other brands because I bought what I did before the hammock trend began. ENO is solid in m experience and it all works well together and I rarely pack my sleeping pad unless it is too cold. If you are going for more of a grab a hammock just in case you want to hang thing check out a cheaper hammock. Also lurk more and read as much as you can on the sidebar. But for the price the atlas and a doubelnest get a double nest trust me you wont be unhappy. I also upgraded my caribiners because of less weight so that was another  bucks.

1967345,0,t3_2h7f7p,Maybe start with exactly what youre doing now and whats not working for you. Pictures would be even better.Its entirely possible to get along with webbing and knots just fine if thats really all youre looking for. You can also sew loops into the ends to get rid of some of the knots. If youre backpacking with your setup there are lighter alternatives but if youre not then maybe what youve got is just fine.At the very highest level what you want to have are straps around the trees which means that unless youre hanging in the same place all the time youll need straps that can handle a range of circumferences and a means for adjusting the length of the suspension between the tree and the hammock. Exactly how you accomplish those things can vary.Even if youre going to DIY looking at existing kits to get ideas is always smart. Some systems use nothing but webbing for both pieces. ENOs Atlas Straps and Kammoks Python Straps are basically just variations on a theme  a webbing daisy chain that is both the tree strap and affords some amount of adjustability by giving you a series of sewn loops to hook your hammock into.There are other lighter and more flexible allwebbing systems though like Warbonnet Outdoors adjustable webbing kit or SLDs cinch buckle suspension that work by running the webbing through buckles that attach to your hammock.Then there are other setups like a marlinspike hitchwhoopie sling suspension that use a shorter length of webbing just to go around the tree and a splicedline whoopie sling to provide the adjustability between the hammock and the tree. One end of the whoopie is connected to the hammock and the other end hooks over a marlinspike hitch knot that you tie in the strap using a toggle of some sort. There are plenty of people making these sorts of kits I use this one from AHE on one of my hammocks. But of course you can make the exact same thing yourself pretty easily.By no means is that an exhaustive list. Whats proper is really going to come down a lot more to your specifics.,Hammocks,ckq9ldq,2,t5_2s7lm

2141264,0,t3_2jhe7s,I started off with homemade  treehuggers and big snaplink carabiners or locking climbing carabiners with rope.  It was strong but heavy and bulky.  I bought a pair of slapstraps from Eno and they work well but they are also bulky and heavy plus they tend to creep a bit after youre set and you can only get within about a foot of your desired strap length because the loops are a foot apart.My Hennessy Hammock came with strong cordage already connected and it was easy to use a lighter treestrap and light carabiner to have tiein point for the cord.  I am not afraid of tying knots so I use the carabiner as a place to loop the cord through and tie a slide and grip knot either an improved tautline hitch a blakes hitch an adjustablegrip hitch or something similar.Then I learned about the WhoopeeSling.  I bought some AmsteelBlue cord and made a few of these wonderful adjustable loops.  I use lightweight polyester  treestraps and a toggle tying a MarlinSpike hitch close to the tree in the webbing then just drop the loop of the WhoopeeSling over it.  Adjustment is quick and easy and it never slips or lets go.The advantage is weight and bulk.  This is by far the lightest setup Ive ever had and it takes up the least amount of room in my pack.  Frankly the larger cord that I removed from my Hennessy Hammock was just as easy to tie and has a couple of other advantages but if youre going for weight and bulk savings the WhoopeeSling is King.By the way sewing loops into webbing is very easy to do.  Nylon stretches by there are stronger straps out there with less stretch and they are not much more expensive.  You can also buy straps with loops presewn for very little money.

Blues grass nonstop campsite jams all night theres even designated areas. There is a music academy  days before so many musicians go to this festival. It really is an amazing experience and everyone is so friendly. Last year I hitch liked from southern nj down to Nashville for  days then hitched from Nashville to Cumberland Maryland for delfest for  days and caught a ride from there home. Did the whole trip without a dollar to my name or any food or even a cellphone. Everyone there is so friendly are caring. Theres a big family scene too. Its rd family rd musicians and  festival goers. Ive yet to hear of anyone who has been to delfest and hasnt made it a yearly tradition since. There is also a natural river running alongside of it and everyone brings floats and does the lazy river. Its fairly cheap I think . The music is amazing and del mccoury is whose festival it is. Its a must go qtleast once for anyone that remotely enjoys music festivals or playing instruments. Last two years I jammed from campsite to campsite from sunset to sunrise every night. And if you like to get weird all the hippies camp in the woods along the river. Other then that you can camp by the familys that dont stay up all night or on the side all the musicians are to just hang out and hear jams all night. Theres a jam tent I slept behind last year in my hammock that had anywhere from  people jamming at once and every  feet there was another campsite filled with people jamming. Its basically the one thing I look forward to every year. Even if you cant make it print me up like  flyers for your company and Ill pass them out all weekend to get you exposure.

He then put a larks head hitch over the bulky knot at the time he connected the kite.Over years of very vigorous flying the larks head never came off of the bulky knot and at the end of the flying day it came off of the line in a second or two when I decided to disconnect it.  While I like the idea of the softshackle it might be overkill.  Of course if you want to make one more power to you.  The solution you propose is really like making one side of the softshackle on one end of the hammock and the other side of the softshackle on the other end of the hammock which should work quite well.,Hammocks,co4ofsr,3,t5_2s7lm

4029924,0,t3_36o8z4,There are two main things that you need to be able to adjust for the size of your trees and the distance between them. Whoopie slings are just a lightweight way to provide that second point of adjustment. When used with a marlin spike hitch where you tie the hitch on the strap provides the first.The sling itself is just a length of hollowbraid line typically Amsteel but some folks use other things like Dynaglide that has a fixed loop at one end and an adjustable loop at the other.The adjustable loop is formed by splicing the line back through itself. When the sling is under tension the braid of the outer section of this bury constricts to grip the inner section preventing the loop from slipping. When you release the tension however you can slide the inner line to make the loop smaller or larger which is what changes the overall length of the sling.Whether you use a structural ridgeline on your hammock or not has nothing to do with whether you use whoopie slings. You can use either one without the other or both together.,Hammocks,crfn4j3,4,t5_2s7lm

4515727,0,t1_cszu3c5,Yes. So the on paper difference is nylon will be better for outdoor use maintain its color longer deal with getting wet better stretch a little less but sacrifice the softness of cotton.We are in the process of testing all of those claims now to see if this is true as we honestly didnt know to what degree this is true.From a comfort stand point I can tell when I first get in which is which but its a minor difference. Weve had friends and family try both and they dont notice the difference. On the durability side the jury is still out.

Results from the tests were that the sheet bend bw webbing and rope is secure for when the webbing forms the U in the bend which would work for my set up at least. Although for the case where the rope forms the U as in your case the knot fails from the rope slipping which wouldnt happen for a fixed loop like yours.

Namely that quilts are too big and heavy.

10090639,0,t3_5kacbv,I have an  ft double wide double layer hexon with the knotty mod fronky net and have only used a daisy chain type set up but actually got whoopie slings for Christmas. I love the fronky net I usually just keep it on the mock when I stuff it in the sack. Its easy to take on and off and easy to get in and out  of. The knotty mod has helped me keep my shit in place where Ive felt like I wouldve have things fall over the side namely my sleeping pad til I get an underquilt. Dont have experience with the cinch buckle but people seem to like them on here they look like a good UL option but the whoopies are really light too and I think the versatility justifies the extra weight ,Hammocks,dbmts07,3,t5_2s7lm

10308107,0,t3_5nkigf,gtKeeps you insulated from the groundThis isnt really a benefit. Instead of the cold ground you get to deal with the cold breeze. Both tents and hammocks need some sort of insulation under you. For a cold AF bug out bag youre going to want a good thick underquilt as well as an overquilt though you need that for tents too. That negates the weight advantage.Trees arent necessarily required either  if you can find decent sized fallen branches pipes or other long straightish things that can support weight you can lash them together and make a turtledog stand You need  with no stakes  if you have at least  stakes or  if you find really strong supports and like  stakes.

10316406,0,t3_5ly0ua, for Dream Hammock. Best camping related purchase I ever made and I sleep in it at home in summer I have a heavy woven cotton hammock for winter. Papa Smurf and the others will look after all your questions and requests. I wanted a custom overcoverbugnet setup and we figured it out together and got it made how I wanted it. Fit and finish is perfect not a stitch out of place. And so many fabric and design choices you will be overwhelmed by choice.My cats sleep with me and their claws have not yet caused a failure hole or run in the fabric. Edit My only regret is Im totally satisfied with my hammock so I have no excuse to go through the customisation process again.
