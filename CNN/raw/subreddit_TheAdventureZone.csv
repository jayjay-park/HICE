8798470,0,t3_508tjf,Very experienced DM here not so experienced with Podcasts but Ive listened to most of the Mcelroy brothers various shows over the last year. My rankings from best to worst... Petals to the Metal Really superb sympathetic characters with some great interactions with the gang. Fantastic comedic and actionoriented moments and setpieces.  Only part to criticize was the boss fight at the end which felt a little too scripted. The epilogue with Captain Captain Bane more then compensated for it though. Murder on the Rockport Limited Fantastic setting with some really funny character interactions. The lack of combat allows for a really goofheavy environment and kept things moving along at a nice pace. I felt like it also gave each character a bit more room to grow and solidify themselves so that by the end of the arc we finally had their basic personalities set down. Griffin created a solid mystery that played out nicely with a fantastic conclusion. Here there be Gerblins This might be a bit of a surprise but I love this arc for two main reasons. First and foremost its because it feels like the Brothers imposing their zaniness on a stock fantasy world which makes a lot of the goofs extra funny to me. The other arcs all take place in the wonderful world Griffin has created for us but which also sort of accommodate the brothers as theyve gotten the hang of the systemsetting. In Gerblins it still feels like theyre messing around with what they can do and you can feel how much theyre enjoying the freedom that comes with playing an RPG. I guess you could say its the only arc in which I feel like its the brothers playing and not their characters. Certainly I wouldnt want TAZ to be that way forever but it does make Gerblins uniquely funny to me. Secondly its the only one so far that lacks a feel good ending and it really sets up the stakes for the rest of the entire campaign. Without the destruction of Phandalin every other arc would really lack for potential negative outcomes at least from a narrative perspective. That the characters are still referencing how much they fcked up in this arc speaks to that. I also just find their total failure really funny and kind of fitting for their characters rather than the frequent success weve seen them enjoy since. The Eleventh Hour Absolutely superb concept thats been well executed. I like the characters weve met and the mysterious aspect has been great. It does seem like its a bit light on actionfights while lacking the clearcut sense of progression we had with Murder on the Rockport. Yet Im very interested to see how it will end and I could definitely see it getting ranked higher in the future. Crystal Kingdom I LOVED the s scifi atmosphere in this one and at times it enjoyed some of the best goofs of the series. Unfortunately I did find that it dragged a bit given the seeming lack of player choice relative to the other arcs. I have no problem whatsoever with episodesarcs running long if it does so because of wacky shenanigans the boys trying to break into the Sharks Hideout in Petals springs to mind but this felt like it ran a bit long without that element of character playfulnessinvention.Moonlighting episodes are great but I dont consider them a full arc at least until the campaign is over. And just to emphasize even the worst TAZ episode is better than any other podcast DnD or otherwise Ive ever listened to.Keep it up bros!,TheAdventureZone,d75gf8a,2,t5_35q2i

9627484,0,t3_5ct86t,Ive been DMing off and on for about  years now having used several different systems while doing so. You are definitely picking the right edition to get started with! This is going to be long winded I hope any of it can help.So one of the biggest things is knowing your players. You adapt the game to fit their wants and needs. Its also quite likely you will have multiple personalities at the table and one of the hardest parts as a DM is navigating these choppy waters. You may have  people who are all about minmaxing character stats and participating in combat and then another  who are big into the role play aspect of things that dont necessarily enjoy combat and then the other  are there to participate in collaborative storytelling. There is no right way to play this game everyones play style is equally as good as someone else even though the two players may not agree on that. My advice for this is use your first session to figure this out watch their tendencies ask what they enjoyed and what they didnt enjoy when the session is done.Next work to know the rules and work as a group to determine at which level they are necessary. This seems weird to say but as you know in the podcast the boys dont follow all the rules and often miss things. Will your playgroup be okay with that? You dont want to be spending your time constantly looking up rules and some times as DM you need to make a ruling to speed the game along even though it may not be Rules as Written RAW. My group for instance has a house rule guide as we had to implement systems for certain rules. This is because of the types of players we have if a rule is made and can be exploited it will be exploited the people at the table like to win and will do whatever gaming of the system that they can. Other groups are not like this and are okay with letting the DM rule and though it may not be exact every time you are okay with it. Certain scenarios for instance youd rather play out as a role play rather than break out into a combat. So even though there are things in combat that would require a feat you may let happen in the role play for the sake of story. But there are people who dont like that at all why have rules to the world if they arent being followed. Figuring this out ties into my first point.This wont be a huge issue as you know the story fairly well and with the resources people have made which include a campaign guide for each arc which is amazing to have. But a huge key as a DM is knowing your world inside and out. Its a huge job and a big undertaking. This can be debated on some DMs will spending  hours prepping for every  hour played others will just have the book and improvise as they see fit. From a personal standpoint I would say the more you know the better. If you know exactly what each NPC sounds like what their personalities are and what they know then having a conversation as them becomes much easier especially if your players start to ask off script questions. I am running Princes of the Apocalypse currently and when I started I had only read a portion of the book and it only made my DMing easier when I had read through the whole story and back story being able to understand the big picture as well as each individual stories. It allowed me to weave a better story.Dont be rigid let it play out how it plays out. You arent recreating TAZ so dont expect that and dont try to foster that. The campaign is just the setting for your players let them help create the story you narrate and they fill the book with the details and conversations. The campaign is fairly linear and doesnt allow for much open world which is great and makes prepping much easier! The great habit you can get into and your players can get into you dont want I am going to do a perception check to figure out whats in the room thats not how it works. Sometimes checks arent needed and you are the deciding factor of this. There are times you may get them to do it just to make it seem like there was a chance at failure. Perception is one of those hard ones everyone has a passive perception and that should be used at all times unless the player is definitely focused elsewhere. The habit your players want to get into is expressing what you want to do and how you want to do it. You as the DM then determine what if any role should be made. I want to explore this room the how using eyes and hands presumably for secret doors or treasure the what you respond to this by presenting a roll or the outcome if a roll isnt needed. Im going to slide down from the roof how the jump off at the last second how and try and land on the guard below trying to knock him unconscious what. This is more a player thing but you foster this. When your players are telling you the skills they want to use to complete a task get them off of that. Stop looking at your sheet and just tell me what you wanna do and how you want to achieve it and Ill tell you what youll be rolling. The only thing I can add to this I like to think the PC would be able to assess a situation and know how difficult it is where the player themselves may not know but you do. The DC will be  which is very hard but the player may be assuming its going to be an easy task so I add things like Looking at the jump you need to make to the guard you know it will be a difficult task will you follow through with your slide? Give them the opportunity to back out if you think they would be able to acknowledge how difficult their task will be. A good rule of thumb for determining if a role is necessary will their be consequences to failure. If the party has all day to search a tavern it is useless to get them to do a perception check when they can just try again next turn until they find what they are looking for. Now if they are being chased and are in a rush to leave the tavern then there are consequences to them failing the perception check.There are so many more tips I can give but Ill just give this one. Do what you can to speed up combats it may not be pretty and some people will argue against this but you have  players and combat will be slow so when they get down to the last goblin and there are  surrounding it dont play it out just finish the combat through role playing. Thats about it if you have any questions specifically let me know! Definitely use the fight scaling tool ukrobb recommended its fantastic. My only tip with this dont always add more mobs it definitely ups the difficulty for certain fights for others it doesnt make it more difficult even though it says it does. If you have  things that have a  to attack and an AC of  HP of  sure there are  of them but they are often missing and almost always dying in one hit. It may show its a Deadly encounter but you would have been better off finding something with higher CR rather than  things of lower CR. Make it fit the narrative thats the primary concern. Best of luck and hope to hear an update!,TheAdventureZone,d9zsa66,12,t5_35q2i

9842703,0,t1_daqirjh,I think its so important to not think of racism as just hate. It can be accidental or even wellmeaning. To ignore those effects what we might broadly call structural racism is to ignore a huge part of what lingers today.,TheAdventureZone,daqizq4,5,t5_35q2i
9858179,0,t1_dasg4fn,Lets lose that severely there. Severely is a movinggoalposts sort of word... it means whatever the user wants it to mean. The fact that something isnt AS detrimental as something else doesnt mean that its not important.As for why its detrimental at all well Im not going to go into tremendous detail here not only are there lots of subtle reasons this is troubling but Im a white straight man so a number of them are largely invisible or nonintuitive to me and could be better explained by people who are more directly affected by them. But one particularly big problem is that limited representation in media helps reenforce and justify stereotypes... to just use TAZ as an example if the THB are white even if Angus and the Director and everyone in the BoB are persons of color then that is sending a clear message about who matters and who is there to support the people who matter. No its not a purposeful message. I know that. But the thing about messages is that you receive and are influenced by them whether they are intended or not and whether you want to be or not. And this message is as troubling as it is because there are so few counterpoints to it. If fantasy were generally good about representation then this wouldnt be an issue.  ,TheAdventureZone,dasjl5e,9,t5_35q2i

11393764,0,t3_62dhnp,Two really great Dad McElroy moments from the episode. Griffins uggggghhhhh as Clint really got into his sleazy cheesy radio DJ voice intro was amazing. You could feel his soul wanting to leave his body.. Clint casually blowing everyones mind by dropping oh yeah Merle is a dick to everyone who interacts with the party because hes so insecure and everyone realized holy shit hes totally right.It just reinforces my thought that hes consciously playing the role of a rd wheel and letting the other PCs drive the action and just getting in there when he can. Sort of like on a morning zoo radio show there are usually  main hosts and then a rd who takes more of a back seat role providing a laugh track and pitching in when needed. ,TheAdventureZone,dfngtrm,57,t5_35q2i

11549779,0,t1_dg4do69,no problem. its a really great show that shows what dampd can be at its best. TAZ is wonderful my favorite podcast tbh but i think everyone can agree its hardly dampd at this point. i am an admitted dampd nerd played it my first time  years ago so seeing a wellmade show playing the game truetorules is something that i can enjoy in a different light than TAZ. theres really no getting around the episode length though lol. i usually just turn it on when im doing something else. that way i dont have to block out  straight hours to do nothing but watch youtube.,TheAdventureZone,dg565b0,1,t5_35q2i

11576392,0,t1_dg82b4f,Small town straight white male here. That was my initial reaction as well but I took a little time to think about it trying to set aside my past thoughts about transgender and the kinda culture that surrounds it and what I kinda came down to is this. This is not my world. This is Griffin McElroys brain child and everything that is created in this place is up to him. If he wants to represent a portion of the community that supportshas supported him for all of these years he has every right to. Regardless if it came across organically or not I think he just genuinely wanted to show his appreciation and support in someway to a community that has helped make his creation what it is today. But maybe Im really far off and he just wanted Lup to be trans from her inception. We the case is Im just excited I get to see Taako and Lup on an adventure so I get to listen to their dynamic play out!,TheAdventureZone,dg86utv,23,t5_35q2i
11578479,0,t1_dg8exf0,Its got nothing to do with the identity politics of the whole thing and more about letting fans influence the story. I feel bad that Griffin has to deal with those kind of people and that hes nice enough to to try and do what he can for them when inevitably its still going to come back and bite him because some people just like being offended.,TheAdventureZone,dg8fdp3,-4,t5_35q2i

11598494,0,t3_65dedq,I loved it I thought it was a cool departure and as a fan of general McElroy brand comedy I know theyll do fun stuff with it even if its not what we are used to from them.,TheAdventureZone,dgap4u1,1,t5_35q2i
11602300,0,t1_dgb0d6d,Im pretty sure it was Paloma. Edit yup confirmed Paloma  Now that you mention Istus though I listened to the whole thing a second time while waiting for episode . I noticed Istus went forward in time to see how the THB did and came back and said they were amazing.  At the time I thought she was going forward to the end of the th hour but what if she went forward to the end of the whole campaign? ,TheAdventureZone,dgb4omq,1,t5_35q2i
11604228,0,t3_65jbqv,Theres an issue with bringing Lup back. Itll mean that they leave the current plane to find another. Leaving pretty much all their friends they made behind.,TheAdventureZone,dgbcke4,2,t5_35q2i

11695686,0,t3_66meaa,Regarding your timeline questions at the end the gang remembers everything that happened after Lucretia wiped their memories of the IPRE in this universe so presumably all their memories of their adult lives happened postyeargap. They also have their memories from before they joined the IPRE so their memories of being children happened pre year gap. Its possible Lucretia also fed the very existence of the other universe into the voidfish so they assumed those childhood memories happened in the same placetime as their later untampered memories.,TheAdventureZone,dglq39i,1,t5_35q2i
11696232,0,t1_dglqsxc,I started when they switched to e like episode  or something like that. You definitely miss a decent amount of story but its still enjoyable and I was able to pick up on most of the relevant background. At some point they actually start a new campaign same characters so you could also try to start there somewhere around episode  i think.  edit They also have abridged versions of the first ish episodes. Basically cutting the hour long episodes down to ish minutes to capture the big story points. ,TheAdventureZone,dglsbei,5,t5_35q2i
11702012,0,t3_66yzsl,I was listening to MBMBAM old episodes last night and they talked about a fan getting a tattoo. I literally thought of this exact line. My favorite line of the whole series. Nice work on this. I genuinely love it,TheAdventureZone,dgmfwyv,14,t5_35q2i

11790133,0,t1_dgw8ytm,so what system do you propose to roleplay a year in half an hour,TheAdventureZone,dgwg97p,1,t5_35q2i
11793959,0,t3_686p7g,Theres something else you might want to consider here Lup is a master of the evocation school of magic. In DnD e that means she has access to an ability called Sculpt Spells allowing her to prevent her spells from harming people she isnt aiming for.The Gauntlet might be the most destructive relic but in Lups hands it would be a more directed and safer weapon. ,TheAdventureZone,dgwvvgk,12,t5_35q2i
11794143,0,t1_dgwvvgk,I was not aware of that thats super interesting!I guess they might actually use the Light of Creation willingly then but nonetheless later on it certainly seems they dont want to hold on to these relics considering they all hide them rather than attempt to use them to battle the Hunger and Im curious as to how they are going to come to that. ,TheAdventureZone,dgwwmib,6,t5_35q2i
