I also started talking to someone who seems to understand a lot of what I go through and its such a relief to share some things with him.,NoFapFemales,ckh1bfj,2,t5_2zbe0

3228754,0,t3_2x2ylh,Hey there and sorry to hear about your relapse.A powerful attitude shift that Ive encountered on the main sub is to look at it as follows I only looked at P once in three months! Let me keep it that way!Meaning yes you had a weak moment. But you for the most part have been incredible! Focus on that. Dont let that inner voice use guilt and remorse to pull you further down.Hope that helped in some way. Good luck on your journey!,NoFapFemales,cownydh,2,t5_2zbe0
