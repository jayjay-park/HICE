This team is in the midst of one of the worst injury bugs in NBA history do you really expect anything more than a tank out of our current noninjured players?While DAntoni may not be the best coach he certainly isnt the worst and should not be blamed for this season. Think about it guys we dont have any strong defensive minded guys we can put in the center for a full  minutesdont say Jordan Hill because his effectiveness dwindles the more minutes he gets and he is injured in nearly every other game and the injuries have been a revolving door effectively destroying any team cohesion possible. Before the injuries hit this teams defense was actually pretty good. Lakers fans seem to need to point the finger at someone for our current situation. In reality where this team is at is more of a product of horrific luck and the last  years of playoff runs. We are rebuilding get over it. ,lakers,cfergh6,10,t5_2qhv6

762210,0,t1_cgqezo5,The reason is the CBA requires all prospective athletes to declare for a draft before they can be signed by any team. However this does NOT mean all players that go through this process are drafted e.g. Pablo Prigioni who went undrafted in  had his rookie season last year. Or even that those players will necessarily be signed by their team. In fact that last development is part of what makes early second rounders so valuable. Rather than signing a first round pick to guaranteed money many organizations prefer to trade down and stash second rounders in Europe or Asia. Even when they want to sign a player though theyre powerless if he decides to play overseas. This is essentially what Tellem amp Pelinka did to help West get Kobe to LA.

1199309,0,t3_27u21a,I think wed beat the Heat for sure in a  game series but against the  Bulls its about . Kobe can harass old Jordan defensively but Jordan will be fresher overall in the end of games because the Bulls will undoubtedly put PippenRodman on Kobe and going up against the two best defenders of all time will be insanely exhausting for even young Kobe. Rick Fox is a toughnosed defender as well but Pippen will torture him. Rodman is a nonfactor on O so Id go ahead and play small more minutes for FoxHorry over Horace on the . Takes away Rodman from the rim and thus his rebounding due to their threepoint shooting ability and Horrys mediocre defense wont be exploited. Ultimately itll go down on how hard Shaq can dominate the paint. RodmanLongley wont be able to do shit against him so he should be putting up  easy. If Kobe can keep Jordan from exploding and Fox can bother Pippen sufficiently we should be able to pull out a win. In a  game series Kobe will also undoubtedly have one of those fuck your defense Im making everything cause Im Kobe motherfucking Bryant games and hopefully it wont be at the same game MJ has one too,lakers,ci4jh3s,12,t5_2qhv6

And Im sorry his offensive game at UK and Prestonwood was entirely based on bullying his defender and getting to the line. That wont work in a league where he is considered small for the PF position. Sure he has some finesse to his game but his limited skill set wont help him against larger defenders. What he has going for him is his motor and athleticism. However he is an extremely predictable player and an unwilling passer. If there is any current player in the NBA who resembles Randle its Anthony Bennet. They are both undersized PFs who dominated high school and college due to being a physical outmatch for their opponents.

Its professional basketball it takes both team and coaching talent to make it that far. And you even say that the Nets team wasnt good which means he deserves more credit. And that NO team was CP and David West. Talented but nothing special.And Kobe had to give his approval to those guys.

Did you ever think that maybe the same Cavs management that fucked up in the past is not in charge of things anymore? The incompetent management thing might have been a good gripe if it were actually a thing but they dont actually have incompetent management anymore which is why LeBron felt comfortable enough going home.Gilbert gets a lot of hate from entitled Laker fans but he is a IMO one of the top  owners in the league. Hes not afraid to fire people call critics on their BS and say what Cavs fans are thinking. He has been a very shrewd owner for them and has invested lots of money in Cleveland and Detroit. Picture how Jeanie or Magic would be if they were sole owner of the team. What is Laker fans only real beef with him? Oh that he wrote a letter that had nothing to do with the Cp trade being vetoed? Plenty of other owners said the same thing at the time including Mark Cuban Michael Jordan and the guy who owns the Spurs. But no one ever mentions their leaked letters. Face it we all know Gilbert was right. If Tommy Boy Buss and Mitch Kupcake didnt have the common sense to hold off a few hours on the trade it would have gone through. That they tried to force it through right after the owners were together is an insult of the highest order. And honestly how many of you can pretend to care about parity as long as your team is excluded from it? Im sick of this superstars or bust shit. We can win without them as the Spurs proved last year. I hope to God the next CBA goes even further in introducing NFL style parity to the NBA.

And if he felt like he could go why not?  Hindsight is  and had they known that hed be unable to go they probably wouldve pushed for a medical retirement.  Likely thats what the conversation was this time around as he struggled to get healthy for the season.  ,lakers,cluuywo,1,t5_2qhv6

Lin literally has not much options as soon as he gets past the half court line. It seems like its a crime to set picks and screens for Lin or something. Lanes are always clogged with jump shooters and their defenders. Lins game is dribble penetration and PampR.  I can tell Lin is trying to be assertive and aggressive by making some high percentage looks for the team. Sometimes when he does that without the right support cast he just over dribbles and turns it over.

2648048,0,t3_2q8xcl,Lets all calm down a LITTLE.  GSW played arguably their worst team game of the season shot poorly and had a slew of turnovers playing their rd game in  nights or something.  The Lakers admittedly played TEAM ball.  Which was great!  Perhaps if they played like that when Kobe is on the floor wed be much better than we are.  This whole the ball stops when Kobe is on the court phenomena is not new.  Anyone who remembers the preChampionship Phil Jackson teams with LO and Smush will remember Phil lamenting how the team passes to Kobe and then stands around watching him do what he does.  Phils solution was always to challenge players to demand the ball Kobe has the same solution and to insist on them running their cuts.  Obviously theres a disparity between when Kobe is on the floor and not but again a sample size of one game isnt as telling as you may think.  Teams playing without their star beating good teams is not a new phenomenon.  It happens quite frequently in the league.  The good team tends to overlook the game and the starless team tends to step up...So lets hold off on the Kobe should come off the benchretirebe tradedbe cut posts because a its not going to happen and b its not going to happen.

2765224,0,t1_cni0v3g,Actually I think this stat is especially good for comparing two players on the same team playing the same position Lin and Price. Especially in this case when they both have started almost the same amount of games so the overall team defense factor is controlled. Surprised at the difference though because Lin doesnt play with Davis much but still has better defense dashboard numbers.The problem with using this stat comparing different players on different teams is because of the overall team defense factor. For example almost all Warriors players will probably have a negative FG difference because of team defense playing well collectively. Flip side almost all Lakers will have a positive difference because the team defense suuucks. So the difference of Lin having an overall . opposing player shoots . better playing against him vs. Curry having an overall . opposing player shoots . worse against him doesnt exactly mean Curry holds his player to . worse FG than Lin. I guarantee if you swap them Lin would be in the negative and Curry would be in the positive although the difference between them would be smaller.Oh and I looked up the Laker bigs. Surprise surprise! Boozer had the best overall difference with . Davis . Hill .. WTF right?! But in bigs case I would probably look more at the less than  feet stat Boozer . Davis . Hill  ..,lakers,cnie8jp,4,t5_2qhv6

Kobe doesnt play well with others who dont see it his way which was forgivable when he was a superstar but not now thats hes washed up and everyone knows Pau was treated like something unpleasant you stepped on.   Moreover youve got to play for Byron Scott who is the opposite of a players coach and makes the last two guys look like geniuses.  Whod want to play for a guy like him?

If we want a shot at convincing free agents to head to the Lakers we will need all the talent we can get.I just dont think our team will be made or broken for a decade by a single pick this year. There are a lot of factors that go into building a successful team and I personally think we have neglected a lot of these areas. Obviously the more high picks we can secure the better but there are more Anthony Bennets extreme example than Kobes in every draft. Im looking forward to this offseason to see how we move forward. I think a lot of peoples frustration stems from the fact that we have been in a transitional limbo for the past few years with no strong presence or identity on the team anymore. ,lakers,cpww97i,1,t5_2qhv6

Pass more play off ball do something right?Hes light heartened so much as everything is just a big joke to him and lacks both professionalism and maturity. Everything that comes out of his mouth comes out as extremely ignorant and self serving. Either hes really that stupid or he for whatever reason feels the need to push this gimmick of his for attention. Either way its ridiculous.The team is made up of a bunch of people that at the current have lapses in effort professionalism and just general basketball skill so Im not surprised that Scotts lost some of them. Maybe its me but Id rather a coach call out Nick for his foolishness than help foster that attitude which could effect our rookies. Clarkson does not need to pick up cues from Nick Young.What redemption can he have? Hell be thirty next year and this is the player he is. Thats what hes been for his career.

The Mavericks Dirk especially were on a mission. We couldnt stop JJ Barea on the pick and roll. Their threepoint shooting was supernatural sure but it wasnt luck.

Because of recent concerns with Rondo well probably go all in and throw a max at Jimmy in which case drafting Mudiay would be a much more solid bet than Winslow.  There shouldnt be too much concern with Mudiay and Clarkson playing well together.  Clarkson looks like a classic combo guard who can play point or shooting guard with equal effectiveness.  His natural inclination is as a scorer whereas Mudiay is more the guy who runs the show. Could be a hell of a   punch ,lakers,crc7eln,1,t5_2qhv6

4037466,0,t1_crggfv2,I keep finding it hard to believe that there is that big of a difference between Towns and Okafor besides fit next to Randle. To me Towns and Okafor are as close to A and B as can be. I also think the fit next to Randle is too big of a concern. Both players will be young and have plenty of time to work on weaknesses. I think they can make it work defensively. Probably not immediately but eventually. ,lakers,crgi2o2,12,t5_2qhv6

4208863,0,t1_crzx7ek,I wasnt basing the argument solely off of size.

Davis did play more minutes in his season but if Caliparis played both individually for an equal time on either Kentucky squad I think Davis would have the higher offensive and defensive rating due to the aforementioned qualities.  I am not trying to knock Towns and would like to see him play with Randle if the Lakers do draft him but I am not convinced that his path to becoming an amazing player or even a really good player is as easy as you think,lakers,crzzy2v,1,t5_2qhv6

How many pro scouting reports have you seen on these players exactly?  Are you a member of the Lakers FO?   We really dont even know what pro scouts say.  Draftexpress doesnt count.  All we have are unreliable reporters that feed information to us that teams feel like giving them.  In fact there was a series of tweets a few days ago from Alex Kennedy that said many FO people felt it was laughable that the general public thought there was any sort of real gap between Towns and Okafor.  Said they were neck and neck.  You made the mistake of thinking that post ability is Okafors only advantage.  Okafor is a better face up player than Towns.  He can score with either hand.  Okafor is a much better finisher. ,lakers,cs4o17i,1,t5_2qhv6

It really wouldnt have made a difference cause he would still have to shoot a high volume to even keep the game close. Kobe would have had a better PPG average cause he drew a lot of shooting fouls in his prime. Lebron literally did everything that he could do his percentages were bad cause he had to play overaggressive for long stretches of games. Playing that way leads to lower percentages and higher turnovers. IMO giving Andre the finals MVP was a terrible decision.

4351873,0,t1_csg5t1m,While I cant say with certainty that Randle and Okafor will become allstars as Cousins is now I still consider them two of the most promising big men drafted and to be drafted in the last few years.  They have the tournament success were coached by Calipari and K to the NCAA title game.  Okafors college stats were . points . rebounds . assists . blocks per game.  Randles  points . rebounds . assists . blocks per game.  Randle played well in summer league before injury showing off guardlike handles good passing ability to finish under double team pressure.  The bottom line is that while they really havent been stellar on both ends of the floor overall the Lakers have great value in pairing them up considering that Julius Randle is  and Jahlil Okafor is .  I find it crazy that people would want to trade them now when in five years they might become an improved more athletic version of the Grizzlies RandolphGasol.

Sure he has somewhat of a tunnel vision thats always been his main weakness but hes a guy Ill trust to be able to get shots out of a double or triple team and make them ala Kobe. You need guys like that for when an offense can get stagnant. Shouldcan he do that every play? ...well of course not especially because hes not an SGSF.

The guy was x the ballhog Kobe ever was the biggest and only real knock on Kobe BTW and routinely got beat by lesser teams because of it. Secondary to that the s Bulls were a damned good team without Jordan. Best coach ever another top  player  other All Star caliber players and some of the best role players to ever set foot on the hardwood. Does that make Jordan better or worse ? I feel like it greatly exaggerates his position because the Bulls were simply better than everyone else at the time. By a lot.As for Lebron are you serious ?! Or just too young too have seen great basketball ? Half the reason anybody even talks about this clown on this level is because they hate Kobe  the Lakers. Hes physically dominant sure but the league is small ball now weak defense no interior presence etc. Id be more inclined to call him GLOAT than GOAT at this point.I measure players based on who they beat and the quality of their competition not just how much everyone else rides their jock. Its easy now for a big SFSG to go low or drive and physically dominate compared to the days of giants. As for you putting LeBron above Magic ... you must be nuts. Magic effectively averaged  for his career in THE most competitive era of basketball weve ever seen. He routinely beat other players and teams who are considered top  HOF etc etc. James hasnt. He was also one of the if not the most clutch players in big games ever. Sure he didnt have the showy shots of Jordan or Kobe but he absolutely dominated routinely. Hell Kobe also has routinely beat great teams and HOF players put up killer stats in his prime etc etc. How many better than Kobe players have we had to endure now ? Iverson Carter McGrady Pierce Allen etc etc. None of which was true then or now all of which were perpetuated by Kobe and Laker haters. Consider this  every argument that people have in favor of Lebron backs Kobes case as well and Kobe has more rings and honestly hasnt been straight up outworked or outplayed consistently like Lebron has. Did you watch that Magic series a few years back ?Lebron essentially has  quality championship against the Spurs in . He completely bombed against an above average Magic team in  lost twice to the same Spurs  for those keeping track where Kobe v the Duncan teams is  etc etc. The only argument people have with him is raw numbers.

No. Does he look like a decent player out there? I think so yes. He is not taking a lot of chances and therefore is not hurting the team which is probably the thing to do while he learns on the job. I think hell be less of a wallflower when he find the NBA range. I dont know if hell be a superstar but he at least doesnt look like some rookies who clearly dont belong in the pros.

5703767,1,t3_3t8fog,Ill repost my thoughts from another Russell threadYou seem to be like most people around here focusing on the upside of Russell based on statistical analysis. The problem youre all running into is in exactly the way youre approaching the issue. Its not a matter of stats produced how that compares to players from previous draft classes or decades or what the expectations were for him relative to the production of other rookie players over the years.Determining the growth potential of Russell comes down to an assessment of his overall talent and how that translates to the current NBA. You can throw all the stats at me you want but Ill ignore numbers and focus on the fact that he doesnt pass the eyeball test. If you have a special player with a special ceiling whether that player reaches the ceiling or not he flashes greatness whenever hes on the court. Youll see small glimmers of ability that set him apart from his peers. In Russells case I see nothing special.Ive said it a million times but my biggest concern is that he cant drive past an overwhelming percentage of NBA defenders in a fast break or iso situation. His athleticism is average at best in a league full of elite athletes at his position and to be honest its mostly mediocre for a  year old who should be extremely agile.The comparisons to James Harden are ridiculous. From day one Harden has been able to drive against virtually any defender in the league. Even if he doesnt flat out beat his man off the dribble he still gets most defenders on his hip which is where his brute strength allows him to power through on the way to the rim drawing contact for a nearly league leading number of free throw attempts. That one dominant skill powers the rest of his game. It buys him space on the perimeter with defenders scared of getting taken to the cup it forces defenses to collapse on him opening up passing lanes and creating opportunities for teammates and most importantly it gives him the tools he needs to manage the offense however he sees fit. If he needs to get guys involved he can. If he needs to shoulder the offensive load he can do that too. And none of it is dependent on a coach an offense his teammates or any help whatsoever. He simply decides to do it and he imposes his will on a game.The rest of the players you mentioned combined several dominant traits to become the AllStar Championship players they were. Some for longer stretches than others but all with a peak of production that was league dominant.Russell has no element of his game that is truly game breaking. He is a dependent player who cannot impose his will on anyone in any situation and at any time. Everyone here crying for more minutes more time for him to mature and for patience around the horn... they simply dont want to believe what their eyes are telling them. This is not terribly difficult to assess but its difficult to digest because we want the Lakers to be competitive again. Unfortunately Jim Buss botched the nd pick. Im not saying Russell cant be a productive NBA player but Im saying hes not going to be an AllStar and hes not going to be a core piece of any championship runs. Hes complimentary.,lakers,cx43wb6,-2,t5_2qhv6

5712362,1,t3_3tbkpv,The best part of the article is where it admits it has a lot to do with our players actually not being very good. I wish the fans would shut up with Byron already hes here we dont have options and you have to deal with him til he leaves. He does a lot of things wrong but its rare for him to be called out for the things HE is actually responsible for most of the things people here blame him for are personal issues with players.You can horde karma here by attacking Byron or protecting any of the other players especially DLo. its ridiculous. The truth is Byron is what Byron has always been he is a standin Coach who is actually doing well developing if you compare the first games or especially summer league to these past few games. However our players are our players too and we happen to have a ton of players who have always been pace disrupting volume shooters who play no defense. thats just the truth and those are the things hurting us and stopping us from winning those games we shouldve won.So hate him all you want but his man up comment actually applies here. DLo has obviously been holding some kind of grudge lately.,lakers,cx56ah5,1,t5_2qhv6
5724982,0,t3_3tej8s,I know we arent a very good team but tanking to obtain a top  pick is just ridiculous as of now. Tanking isnt a very good idea anyway. If the draft was an inverse order of the standings tanking would be harmless but it is completely dangerous to lose many games with the possibility of plummeting and losing the draft pick. The young players still have potential of winning games and if they arent giving their best effort then players wont be able to develop late in games and our team will become incredibly dysfunctional. I dont think the draft pick will have much of a significant impact right away and we are probably going to be talking of tanking NEXT SEASON if it happens this year. The only way to progress is to get big free agents to come to LA and that is possible if we just let Jim Buss go. And although we dont have a good team if everyone is able to play hard then some players on opposing teams might be impressed with the upside and could potentially buy it if the Lakers are able to convince him that he can be the FRANCHISE PLAYER. We should wait until at least January and if no progress is made then the discussion can begin. As of now its dangerous and unlogical.,lakers,cx6qniy,1,t5_2qhv6

Paying Kobe for the reasons you stated did happen though but you seem shocked. I thought that was just common knowledge as to why Kobe got paid.I dont think Kobe is thinking fuck it either. This is more obviously a matter of Kobe going out finally seeing hes no longer capable of the things he used to be good at. however I think these new players will be the reason Kobes career is extended another  yearsas a coach. This guy is going to see how good these guys are gonna be and how well he is doing coaching them up and going to lead the Lakers to their new Dynasty. Coachbe and the Kids. Hes Phil Jackson Lite anyway.but yeah Kobe didnt sacrifice anything its just wishful thinking on your end. he got paid its all he wanted on his way out cuz he thought he was still able to go and hes finding now that he cant. its why he wont resign with a good contract. he will either retire more than likely now or take a backseat with vets min.

5979563,0,t3_3xch5e,This trade doesnt work for anybody.First off what does a RandleNoel front court have over a NoelOkafor front court. Theyll have the same spacing issues that they had before because neither Okafor or Randle have a knock down shot and the defense would be about the same. Their offense would still be a mess on that end. Perhaps even worse off since Okafor is a legit low post scorer averaging near  ppg and neither Randle or Noel are able to replace that production at the moment.Of course now you can say they are doing the trade for Clarkson but again why would they make that trade? They need a point guard but trading their potential franchise center to get a capable PG would be pretty near sighted especially for a franchise like Philly that has been willing to tank for the last few seasons. Theyre obviously in tank mode as well so why would they make a move to improve their roster by giving up potential? I just dont see them doing it. So when we look at the combined trade of Clarkson and Randle for Okafor we need to do a proper job of assessing value. I do believe that out of Randle and Clarkson one of them will become an all star but Jahlil has the potential to be a franchise player. Even though the trade may seem equal trading two potential all stars for a potential franchise player teams normally dont make these type of young talent for slightly better young talent trades. For reference it would be like Orlando trading Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton for Philadelphias Nerlens Noel and Robert Covington. Its not a good enough trade for either side to want to make the trade let alone both so it probably wouldnt go through. Teams normally want to keep their good young talent to try and develop chemistry between all the players and personal. Unless a trade is going to make a clear difference for the team its not going to happen. As for us I dont think the trade works for us either. You talked about how Russell and Okafor could create a great two man game together but how? Their play styles certainly dont lend themselves to each other. Okafor cant run the Pick and Roll or Pick and Pop. Hes not fast enough or a good enough finisher in the lane to be a good PnR player and he cant shoot more than  feet away from the basket making him not able to run the PnP. His scoring style doesnt require someone to facilitate for him. Okafor scores by posting up toss him the ball in the paint and hell normally come up with a basket. Its not a matter of having a good point guard getting him better looks its a matter of him getting a mismatch on his defender and having good spacing. However Randle can easily feed off of Russell on the offensive end. Randle can run the PnR pretty well already due to his speed and size he also has shown that he could develop a shoot. He made a three last night and has made midrange shots before. He definitely is not there yet but he has the potential to improve into a decent shooter. I am still a little weary of the ClarksonRussell back court because their defense is atrocious but I do not think this trade is the way to go about amending that problem. ,lakers,cy3g9tw,7,t5_2qhv6

Hes already  years old and turning  in two months.  Hes a nice vet to have but if we want to start making noises again hes not going to solve our problems. Mozgov wont be going anywhere Cavs are capped out so the only thing they can do is resign their own guys. And I doubt they would allow him to walk especially if their only other center is Andy Varajao. Plus its hard to convince a guy to leave Lebron James. lolBismack Biyombo isnt a free agent this year hes locked in until . And I dont think Biyombo is the answer for your starting center for an  game season. Good role player though if you have guys that like ISOing all day. I cant see him in a Spurs or Warriors type of offense where every player is critical and is a threat to the defense. Unfortunately nowadays max contract guys dont have to dominate both ends of the floor I understand your belief because I was on the same boat.

That ball in there hands is so small because there so huge its like if we were shooting free throws with a tennis ball. Not much grip for them so technically its not free points for them. There should be some type of change when ur in crunch time maybe make centers shoot  free throws idk that could help by if u hack then you could loose the game if he makes all three or you get lucky he doesnt hit any.            You people depict it as if these guys arent practicing all the time. Look at a guy like rondo or how bout Tracy mcgrady too both were guards both huge hands both werent  percent free throw shooters.

6827006,0,t1_d0q3pwn,Theyre good achievements for sure. Melo has much more of a Lebron statline now and shows that he wants to work with the team. However I think that his achievements are outweighed by his failures. Hiring Fisher was not a bad idea although there were significant growing pains. The issue was his midseason firing. Signing a veteran who knows the triangle is not a bad idea but having Vujacic as your only other SG was not a smart plan. Similarly overloading the frontcourt when KP needs developmental time probably not the best choice. ,lakers,d0q52t3,9,t5_2qhv6

There are exceptions though so its not  out of  times. Jabar Magic Duncan LeBron level prospects you dont trade even for current top  guys in all cases. Especially now with the stupid value of rookie contracts and depending upon the contract duration and value for the top  guy youre trading for. If Lebron was coming out this year without knowing anything about his career I would not trade the  for Boogie Blake any of the superstars on one year deals KD westbrooke etc unless you had a good chance of getting them to resign. ,lakers,d0z19jb,0,t5_2qhv6

7220428,0,t1_d1ytrya,In hindsight the Steve Nash move was a bad idea. I can understand the argument for hiring dantoni over Phil.  Steve NashDwight pampr could have been great but didnt end up working out because Nash got hurt and one of the best pick and roll big men didnt want to play pick and roll. Dantonis offense has influenced a lot of modern NBA teams. It could have been more of Jims doing but no one here knows the whole story.Since then Mitch has realized that no one wants to come to LA right now so he needs to build through the draft. I think he hired laker family to take the fall over the past two seasons because good established coaches probably want to stay away from the team in its current condition. Byron probably took the job because he really doesnt have much to lose in terms of his coaching record. This contract could be his one last big payday before he retires and spends the rest of his life chillin. Mitch has drafted decently with his picks. Sure hes made mistakes but hes also had some bad cards dealt to him. It took him a few years after the shaqKobe breakup and it will take a few years after all the shit thats gone wrong lately.

I didnt dispute that these teams have a triangle back bone however they play at a significantly higher pace. He also had gripes with Fisher for running too much PnR which is probably the best goto play for the talents of our guards and Randle. Phils hate parade is mounting because his ego wont allow him to hire a good proven coach he obviously knows talent if he had the balls to take Porzingis but he seems to be an ego maniac in his old age and i dont what his arrogance Jerry West is a lot more humble. The problem isnt the triangle the problem is that Phils cronies dont make it eclectic like the Warriors have and that can be measured. ,lakers,d1z1icu,1,t5_2qhv6

He plays great man defense and is great at rotating over but by no means does he protect the rim. Thats why I was saying when he moves over to the five the fact that the rest of the guys can play great defense and keep their man in front of them limits the amount of times draymond has to move over and contest people at the rim.

Itll only be a  year deal and the cap is going to increase every year which makes the contract we offer not the max eventually. He is still young and wont really be out of his prime when our young guys hopefully finish developing and start producing. Also with such a young team we need a guy that can get his own shot and bail the team out.

7820399,0,t1_d3v174l,Whiteside Ive said this a ton. Hes the only player besides Durant this summer that paying him M wouldnt at all be a mistake. Horford Personally I think hes garbage. Ive watched his teams fail every single postseason and he disappears. If you think thats his coach and his team or some other reason Im not gonna argue. I think on a max players around the league would stupidly agree and think its a great signing. Batum Parsons Lee Bazemore are all indemand. Theres no way to get them except overpay and do it significantly. Even if its a . chance of Landing KD  Ibaka and they want to come without Westbrook wed still have a slot for Blake Griffin Gordon Hayward or Gallinari. Finally  wins and the worst team in the league is possible beacuse Sixers are looking to trade Noel  Okafor for a veteran PG at the moment that rumor is Jeff Teague theyre adding a  pick and finally getting two of their previous lottery picks. Thats like signing all  Courtney Lees at the very least. They should easily jump to  wins.  Brooklyn has  to  million to spend this summer and they cant even tank if they wanted to for three years. Theyll be the ones offering Lee M Barnes M Bazemore M. Theyll easily get past  wins in the East Phoenix is getting their AllStar guard back  the th th and th and th pick. Even if they waste two of those picks on highrisk highreward players theyre probably coming away with a starter and a rotation player.  more wins done. Minny probably doesnt have to do anything. Their bourbon is in the barrel its just gonna get better every year.  Denver with      and the only player theyre gonna lose is DJ Augustine. They probably dont get much better but I cant see them getting worse.  Sacramento finally a coach for Cousins that values bigs and wont get fired midseason.  wins minimum. If they manage to steal Mike Conley from the Grizzlies may as well Swap Memphis and the Kings. Marc Gasol Randolph and Tony Allen win  games though. Possible they hold out Gasol and tank but their pick is only top protected their coach said they dont plan on losing. New Orleans or New York could easily fall down a bit depending on their summers. But each team has just enough pieces that barring a major injury theyre not going to lose more than  games. If the Lakers only add Ingram and a couple vets youre asking our core which includes an yearold rookie get more than double their wins without any of the veteran help they had the year before and without a leader like Kobe Bryant. I dont think Mitch wants a total collegedorm type locker room and will indeed go after some vets but hell try to get guys on  year deals and minimums again. Theres even the chance that Mitch sees the landscape in December and tries to get a couple pickswaps to guarantee a top pick by giving away talent and taking on a bad contract.

8140668,0,t3_4qqm4c,With Clarkson being a restricted free agent Im not really sure why the Lakers signed him so fast like this. The worst case scenario would have been if any other team offered Clarkson  years for  million and the Lakers would have just matched it and kept him anyway. Also the benefit of that happening would have been that Clarksons contract would have been structured for the Lakers where they only would have had to pay him just under  million for each of the first two seasons before his salary jumped up to  million for each of the last two seasons. By signing him now instead the Lakers will just have to pay him . million for each of the four seasons. I guess they save  million total but it is possible nobody else would have even offered Clarkson the max since it would have helped out the Lakers by allowing them to match and have his contract be so capfriendly for the next two years. I guess it probably wont matter too much though since the Lakers still have some  million in cap space. ,lakers,d4v4ngr,0,t5_2qhv6

Hes most effective at pf and we have a rookie behind him so not surprised ppl think its a weak position.Center is not a position of weakness imo at least not in this system and in todays NBA where centers just need to rebound defend screen and put back. Weve got an NBA quality big with moz and a energetic capable backup in black and a promising rook with zubs.For me I chose sg because both Lou and Clarkson are slightly undersized imo especially Lou. Both arent above average defenders both are about average at shooting and both do better with the ball in their hands. So imo if I had to upgrade any position it would be sg and have Clarkson come off the bench to lead the second unit. Pg and pf are the two strengths of this team imo.,lakers,d8zlio4,2,t5_2qhv6

9392328,0,t1_d96hyb8,It makes sense though right? Young is natural in the  slot with more defensive upside than Lou and Clarkson hopefully Clarkson works on this over the season. Lou is more of a natural th man. However his minutes will be a tad bit limited because Clarkson should be getting starter minutes even off the bench. Our potential starting  has a lot of defensive upside with good shooting coming from . Ingram should be coming off the bench for awhile with some games starting. He has much to learn and I think Deng is the perfect teacher for him. If Randle can develop a consistent midrange he should get the starting role. However I think the player that develops into the better PnR playerdefensive upside should get the starting spot. Be that Nance or Randle is a debate for another day.

9516277,0,t3_5b1fa4,I think the Celtics have the same problem now that theyve had for the last few seasons they dont have anyone on their roster who looks like they could develop into the kind of star you need if youre going to win titles. They have a lot of very solid players and maybe even a player or two who could be a third best player on a championship team possibly a second best player but I doubt it. So the Celtics might be slightly better than last year but I still expect them to get hammered in the playoffs by a team that does have those kinds of players. The Lakers on the other hand do not yet have this issue even if they are clearly a worse team right now. The Lakers maybe just because they are so young represent a lot of potential upside that a more realized team like Boston doesnt have. We dont yet know if any of the Lakers young core will be superstars but at least the jury is still out and the most optimistic people think its possible at least one of the young Lakers could eventually be good enough to be a primary option for a title team. But nobody really knows that for sure yet obviously. I will say that I think the Lakers have a couple players currently on the team with a higher potential ceiling than anyone in Boston. Whether they live up to that potential though remains to be seen. In other words the Celtics most likely path to a championship right now involves a player who is not yet on their roster they will either draft this player or more likely will trade for him. The Lakers most likely path to a title though probably does involve someone who is already on the roster. If all the young Lakers are busts then obviously they wont win anything but if they do win a title in the next decade odds are its because at least one and maybe a couple of the young guys develop into a bona fide star. ,lakers,d9m317o,1,t5_2qhv6

9608600,0,t3_5ckgvz,Im not too worried about the bad shots per say on Offense and Im more than happy with where our effort and understanding are at on Defense but I do not like how long it takes us to get into offensive motions. We are great on transition because our players can go  on  and if we have the ball up the court fast we usually run really clean sets. However when we bring the ball up slowly usually we only start a deliberate move with  or so seconds left on the shot clock and that rushes it for us. Weve gotten lucky with tip ins and offensive rebounding but that will be an issue for us when the game slows down and matters.  Obviously the Warriors have so much more talent and skill and time together but whenever they are on offense their players also move a lot. We have great ball movement on offense but our players are too stationary. Going to a more dynamic offense is very hard but thats the one thing that Id like to see more and more. Even if its just by a few seconds I want to see more action.,lakers,d9xgfqr,3,t5_2qhv6

Also if Klay continues to get phased out of the offense in Golden State he could be a target in . He can come home to LA and play for Luke who he already likes.

But they also shown that they can fall flat on their faces quite easily.  We lost two trap games against a struggling Dallas and Chicago on a back to back without Wade.  I feel a lot of it probably had to do with the unconscious expectation that they could win the game easily since the odds were in their favor.Lets also not mention how tilted they were during the shitty Twolves game with terrible officiating.I feel like if they can make strides in enduring things when they dont go their way they can really become a possible playoff team.Well only time will tell.

McLemore and WCS on the kings and Hezonja on the Magic.

10021066,0,t3_5j4f5d,When I watch Brandon play I see a player whos conflicted. At Duke he wasnt at all bashful about hitting those catchandshoot s. He knocked em down. Were all upset hes not hitting his shots  I think it has something to do with coaching. Lukes got BI playing the point and so Brandon is thinking about his teammates getting open to the point that he doesnt realize when hes open himself. Id like to see a game when DLo is back where DLo and Luke do their best to get Brandon consistent shots throughout the game and keep that up for a game stretch. Yes you have good shooters to pass to Brandon but youve got as much scoring talent as anyone on the floor. Use it.With that said finding a balance between distributing and scoring is one of the most difficult things for a young guard in this league to understand. Glad Luke is focusing on distributing right now but I dont want BI to grow into a secondary point guard I want a killerinstinct scorer who fires at will.,lakers,dbdrtu4,6,t5_2qhv6

I wouldnt want the front office to stop trying to seek a defensive cornerstone at center just because mozgov is already there and being paid luckily most our best players are on rookie contracts so when the time comes to extend them moz should be about on his way out or at least his contract will be far more tradeable by then. ,lakers,ddc6tgp,10,t5_2qhv6

Thats all we can ask for now we just wait and see what happens. We arent building around anyone. Were still developing young talent and seeing who pans out.

10632115,0,t1_ddck096,Honestly his ceiling is predicated on two things his efficiency and his freethrow rate. Right now he attempts . shots per game which may not seem like much but when adjusted to per  thats nearly  attempts per game. That mark puts him near Bradley Beal Jimmy Butler etc. in terms of attempts per . He already takes a bunch of shots for a guy of his age. So if he can shoot anywhere from  from the field in the future which is totally feasible JC shoots  from the field hes pretty much a guaranteed  PPG scorer. On top of that if he can take his . FTr and bring it up to like . thats an additional  PPG. If he can do these two things hes a star. But if he continues to not go to the line much and remains a  shooter who relies almost exclusively on his perimeter shot hell be a longterm starter which isnt bad but isnt what youd want from a number two pick,lakers,ddcmeeu,6,t5_2qhv6

I visited with my dad yesterday and told him about this and your usernamehes almost  and laughed and also asked him why didnt the Sixers back then beat Russells Celtics and he said that it seemed like the Celtics as a team were far above the rest Wilt was a phenomenon but the Celtics could restrain him with Russell and beat the rest. I never liked how Jerry West left the Lakers organization Phil Jackson had a great coaching record and all that but it too often made me think that that record was more about him being in the right place at the right time than about pure basketball wizardry. If he was so great how come he couldnt get Shaq and Kobe to coexist? Shaq was almost a get out of jail free card as far as referring him wenttoo much of what he did on offense seemed like technically an offensive foul to me whether his jump step or just being so massive that even when he legally pivoted in the post his defender would be easily brushed aside and Shaq would have a clear look. I wish Kobe couldve overlooked Shaqs dietary issues and just played with him they probably couldve won  titles together at least. ,lakers,ddqsbtb,1,t5_2qhv6

Ive seen him get compared to B Roy as a player plenty of times lol. Even B Roy had horrible knees in college but played through it. College players hoping for the NBA play through injury in college so they can keep it disguised and get to the league. I see Fultz took that approach in the beginning but just couldnt handle it. Must be bad if he couldve just gotten on the court and played relaxed like he didnt care that wouldve been best. Scouts would just give him the Ben Simmons treatment and be like Oh okay he checked out.

11162017,0,t1_dex1oi8,No I love DLo. But he is immature. I think he will be fine long term. He has already matured a lot. So how has he never done anything wrong? Look if you think the franchise is wrong ok but you also think the media is missing on this? The media has called him out. Go on twitter of any writer your pick to a manwoman they have written a piece about him being immature. Again if it was one person it might be a grudge. BUT when it is EVERY single person who knows anything about him their is truth there. Yes he says a lot of the right stuff publicly. Those arent actions. You clearly never dealt with someone with a drug addiction. I have co worker. She always says the right things. Always charming. But she is destroying her own life. Fall for it if you want but in truth he needs to continue to grow up. And I say that as a fan. The more mature he is the better chance he hits his ceiling. So you should be on my side. We want the same thing.I didnt complain when Randle got benched either. Young players need to be held accountable. I dont understand why you think because Booker gets minutes all young players should. Thats like saying MS lets its employees go home at  Google needs to do that. Um no there is no proof leaving early makes you more productive. In fact I dont understand why fans use Booker at all. So just so you here is Bookers Advanced stats difference from his rookie yearHe is up in PER by  points. His TS is exactly the same. His assist percentage is down .. His WS down .. His BPM went up by .. VORP by .. DLo has his PER increased by  points better than Booker. TS increase slightly. Assist percentage increased by . WS by . BPM by .. And VORP by ..One player is making good progress the other is Booker. Booker is making hardly any. Yet you pretend like he is breaking through. In fact their per  are nearly identical this year. Except Booker scores  more points and DLo gets  more assist. Advanced stats have DLo as clearly better this year.My point about things like facilities is that teams are spending millions to help the players be the best they can. They are not sabotaging them. All teams are actively trying to improve players. You guys act like they want DLo to fail. Top  picks get more invested in them than anything. They havent jerk him around. They have been harder on him to get him to improve again more than Booker has. Maybe everyone in the FO is wrong. Maybe the coaching staff is wrong. Maybe the media is wrong. Maybe the whole world is wrong about DLo. But can you name me a time when everyone else is wrong. Sounds a lot like a drug user. PS.      DLo complaint last night was how poorly he played the minus  plus minus not playing time. Not starting. If you could be objective you would see that.,lakers,dex7b5f,4,t5_2qhv6

A guard can play off the ball or on the ball or both. If the guard can do both it just means he can be used in more ways by the offense than a guard who can only do one.DLo played both on and off the ball in college. Hes done both for his two years as a pro. He played both last night. He played guard. That is all. Luke Waltons offense is similar to the Warriors in that no one player dominates the usage rate. Steph Curry plays off the ball plenty. He plays on the ball plenty. Same with DLo.

11332153,0,t1_dfger08,Is DAngelo going to make a leap because of  more minutes per game? No. He should be playing because thats his job and the experience is good. I think what people may not understand is Russell needs to learn to do his damage in about  minutes because in the best case scenario where we land a top pick hit on our late s pick grab Paul George and maybe a couple serviceable players he wont be playing extended minutes or have a particularly high usage. Thats how Golden State won  games. They had top tier talent that was fresh for  games and they had a strong bench. Curry played over  minutes only  times.  of his games were in the  mpg range. That means the context of the game determines if hell be in a little longer or shorter but the strategy was determined at the beginning of the season and followed strictly. Luke wasnt just hired because he can connect with players wore Purple and Gold or can run a pick and roll spread offense with a lot of motion. Hes bringing in an entire strategy that hes evolved from the coaching trees of Phil Jackson  Greg Popovich gt Steve Kerr gt Luke with input from BShaw and the rest of the coaching staff. Its fine if you disagree but at least recognize the strategy ies. DAngelo is also still very young and Luke should and has no problem disciplining poor play. DAngelo hasnt complained about any of this. Hes in the loop on why his minutes are fluctuating our pick situation and why the team is playing guys with expiring contracts and his own personal goals and assigned mission is. Also from a development standpoint I think more than understanding the game or putting up shots his body needs the most work and nobody makes gains during the NBA season playing  mpg. Offseason is more important and you can only do that if youre healthy. With a month and a half left why risk it by burning him out on a high MPG high usage plan?,lakers,dfghaur,8,t5_2qhv6

11631965,0,t1_dgefrw1,Youre just dead wrong. SSampR on SB Nation is also very pro DLo along with Lakersground. The only big anti DLo crowd is the social media fools on Twitter and FB who do  research and expect every top pick to become an immediate AllStar. If you cant see why people love DLo I can break it down simply. His per  PPG APG RPG and steal numbers at his age have only been matchedexceeded by Lebron James in NBA history. He is already a starting caliber PG at age  and advanced stats back it up. He is without a doubt the best PG in his age group and has the most potential. His court vision and passing ability is great but haters point to the turnovers and relatively low assist totals. A lot of turnovers are caused by guys fumbling the ball or not being ready for a ball that is fit through traffic. The low assist totals are caused by the fact our only consistent shooter this year outside of DLo was Nick Young and Lou Will but he barely played with Lou. His defense needs work but he has the length and size to be at worst a good team defender. It doesnt help that the team is devoid of good defenders.The most maddening thing about DLo haters is they all want Lonzo Ball to replace him. People think that Lonzo is the savior of the franchise when in reality he will have growing pains and will likely have the same issues on defense as DLo. DLo and Lonzo could work phenomenally together offensively. DLo needs another playmaker on the team in order to maximize his scoring ability and same with Lonzo Ball.  TLDR DLo is our best player and the best young guard in the league and we should keep him.,lakers,dgehuv9,16,t5_2qhv6

Giving up any of the core will create more problems with the exception of Ingram who looks to be the best of the pack. Tricky situation. Cant wait till ping pong day. Its consequently the day I graduate from college!,lakers,dgu4atr,7,t5_2qhv6
