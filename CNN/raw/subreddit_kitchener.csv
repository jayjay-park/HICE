289847,0,t3_1xergt,As another incentive Wind will give you unlimited calling and internet in the US for  a month.  You can add it anytime and cancel it any time.Data when youre on the road wont be great because outside of the cities even on the  between here and Toronto you will have dead spots.  However phone calls and I believe texting can be made from those areas at a reasonable additional price.  Data though will cost you an arm and a leg when roaming.Wind has been great for our family and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend them to anyone so long as they understand that the savings come at the price of countryside coverage.  Dead spots in KW are no worse than any other carrier but are in different places.  For example Rogers has  bars coverage at my house Telus  Wind .  A friends house provides  bars Telus  bars Rogers  bars Wind.  ,kitchener,cfat2ix,1,t5_2rzoh

7418681,0,t1_d2k0l0z,gt Because there is underlying systemic racism in stereotypical responses like thatThe point youre trying to make is worth making but youre losing your audience. When you simply call someone racist they dont see themselves as such e.g. Im no KKK member and will generally not seek to understand the truth from which your desire to comment stems. First the presence of a recent immigrant community does predictably increase the local access to that communitys cuisine. Of course part of this is because those people dont have access to other work so start small restaurant businesses. At the same time its not at all racist to celebrate ones access to diverse cuisines. I personally dont assume that uzeePlatooN meant to express that immigrant communities are only good for their food. My understanding of the point youre trying to make is that we all have limited experience and understanding of other cultures and can have a tendency to envision them as caricatures. Its a natural human tendency to do so and we have to be aware of it so that we can avoid doing it and seek true understanding before making assumptions. ,kitchener,d2lgff3,2,t5_2rzoh

I wanted all my electives to be film but nooooo Laurier wanted me to balance out my course load with useless classes I could care less about.ampnbspIll admit Ive lost some interest in the art and foreign films I loved while I was in school. Simply dont have time anymore and with Gen X gone its so much harder to check out that great Italian film you just heard about. The central KPL location has an incredible foreign film section though.Princess and the Apollo host some events cult film nights and festivals. Laurier also has film nights that Im pretty sure are open to the public or at least you can go check them out and no one is going to demand student ID at the door.,kitchener,d35la3m,1,t5_2rzoh

7874059,0,t1_d40y2n8,Thanks for your reply and concern.  The advisory committee doesnt work that way.  Nor do we earn a paycheck since we are all volunteers chosen by elected city council.   No advisory committee chooses the future design of the school.  The architect that the school board chooses would have a heritage theme to continue any future additions.  As for professionals the architect that designed Bluevale Collegiate was a professional that designed a school without windows for classrooms on the second and third floors which were the floors with the most amount of classrooms per square foot of floor space.  It was like that for many decades.  The school board approved it back then.  I learned from the professor last month that Bluevale was renovated to incorporate windows into the classrooms not just the ones facing the expressway. Another bonus to the public having a designation say is more info is available to the public regarding the students learning atmosphere.  Ill give you an example from yesterdays approval of Suddabys application for new windows and a door.  A councilor asked if the work will be done during summers months when school is out?  The representative stated the school board was not able to have windows purchased in time for the summer.  I asked if the work will be done after school and weekends?  The answer was no during school hours.   I know what its like trying to concentrate during construction.  Mind you replacing windows and a door is not as bad as a jack hammer on concrete or dump trucks slamming their tailgate via quick acceleration to get the last few remains out but it is still a distraction that the public now knows in advance.  It also tells us of the decision making skills for construction planning at the school board whether it be not researching permitting and ordering in advance or putting out tenders for a construction crew to work after school and on weekends or even winter holidays.  So they may be professionals as in getting paid for their work but they were not diligent nor mindful respectful of the students atmosphere. I understand the difficulty in placing a tender and choosing a company for trust and quality of work but the criteria is something the school board has control when placing the tender as opposed to the quality of construction and completeness city hall rotunda rain leak.  So this Heritage permit process yesterday was revelation to the city volunteers media and public.  As for the school board choosing books well I can tell you as an advanced Biology student at Bluevale the school board chose to rebind text books from the s that were proven wrong instead of new text books The school was opened in the s.  What good is disproven text books for students headed for university in s?  These were rebound text books that instructed students to blacken a piece of glass with smoke from a candle then look through it towards the sun during an eclipse!,kitchener,d4147qz,1,t5_2rzoh
7874279,0,t1_d411g91,Have you ever installed windows and doors on a building?  I have.  Old windows are the easiest to repair which is what these high schools have unless replaced with modern windows.  Depending on the school you walk in with a pane of glass remove the old hardened putty place new window pane in place and reputty the edges.  Choosing a modern window means you have to remove the entire encased window which is a two person job.  The old way is the cheaper way. haha.  The new modern way is more expensive to purchase and costs more to install which I still recommend regardless if it has heritage protection or not.  Also the new windows of today are more insulating not just thermally but acoustically as well.  Thanks for your contribution.,kitchener,d4153sj,2,t5_2rzoh

7898240,0,t1_d43q7sz,Theres also the issue that were starting to see Boomers sell their semirural and smalltown homes and move back into the cities as they downsize and move closer to services. And those moving from edgesuburbs back towards the city cores.The Boomers are competing with the Millennials the people who could possibly most use cheaper housing prices but they have a marked tendency to prefer the cores and proximity to transit so even the welltodo ones who can afford a house car and a commute replication the urban flight or a generation or two earlier.It makes me wonder whether the GenXers like myself are going to be the winners or losers here. We had the skyrocketing educational debt and lousy job prospects that everybody seems to think are unique to Millennials and fewer of us own our own homes than our Boomer parents did at the same age. But were mostly settled now and theres a large cadre in its s that would love to own their first home. Wed like to move out to the country  we understand that urban flight dream of our boomer parents  but were also the ones who started the sequence of antisuburban urban revitalization that makes it possible for the Millennials to have that choice of staying closer to the city cores so we understand services amp transit access too. Though that was mostly because we could hardly afford to live in the suburbs and the cheap apartments and condos of empty decaying cores bequeathed to us by the Boomers were there and the businesses just followed us in.What to do.

10010528,0,t1_dbbkt3m,Problem is like everybody here has been telling you it did snow continuously if lightly for over  hours contrary to your claim.It also seems like youre not tacking into account a few things.First if its snowing while they are plowing you could go through half an hour or an hour after an early morning plow on your way to work and there would that much accumulation again. Same thing goes for your drive home from work.Second when it is snowing continuously like it did for over  hours when do the snowplow operators get a break? And I dont just mean a  every few hours I mean time to sleep.So heres my hypothesis. You went to work Thursday morning around  about  hours after the snow plows last went through on your route so there was further accumulation. You not realizing how much it had been snowing or that it had been snowing pretty much continuously since Tuesday morning and overnight thought that nothing had been plowed. Then on your way home from work the plows had gone along your route before rush hour but because it was still snowing and accumulation would have happened you think that things still havent been plowed.Since you thought thought that the City waited until the snow stopped falling to start plowing rather than that cm benchmark that would seem like a reasonable hypothesis to me.,kitchener,dbcefpt,2,t5_2rzoh

This is more so for the larger  lane roundabouts where the inside lane has many options. Lets talk pedestrians using the crossovers.
