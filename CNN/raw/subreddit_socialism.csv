In fact in a lot of places a substantial basic income could be achieved without altering the tax code at all.gt Im affraid I dont fully understand your answer to the first part. Can we look at an example? Fast food jobs cleaning jobs why would anyone want to work in them if they were guaranteed money for not doing anything every month?That works out fine unless you want to buy a new TV some weed or you want to eat out more often. Rather than working these jobs just to get by the people who do work them would be doing so to afford luxury goods. This has a few positive impacts It spurs consumption and by extension production. There are a lot of people who would purchase a new TV but just do not have the means to do so as all or nearly all of their wages go towards living expenses. It gives laborers more leverage. If Im only working a shitty fast food job so that I can afford luxuries then I can afford to quit my job or strike if Im working under bad conditions. It eases automation. In the next  years were expected to displace over  of the workforce most of those jobs entry level or near entry level.

99688,0,t3_1v8l62,gtwhich I think is pretty much true of uswho is this us?In many ways discussions like this are futile.  The terms and vocabulary of the debate have been defined and so any argument is lost without first redefining the terms.  Take redistribution.  This has been defined as taking wealth which naturally and rightfully belongs to the capitalists who appropriate it from workers and giving it to the undeserving or as charity to those who have made poor choices etc.Even liberals will accept that the wealth rightfully belongs to the capitalists. Or that they rightfully earned it through their hard work.  Or variations on this theme.  As long as redistribution is seen in terms where those who have appropriated the wealth of workers legitimately control that wealth in anyway the argument is lost. Not sure you can launch into conversation in the middle of class in the context of the teacher actively propagandizing which would be worth the effort.

The Federal government U.S. by intervening in the economy ensures they keep that money at the top through taxes inflation and borrowing a lot of which they ensure stays in the stock market and financial system through regulation.Then there is price.

495598,0,t1_cfw091w,I would argue that internationalism can be achieved alongside socialism. Both are key to to the other. All the international socialist groups seem to be the ones that survive and continue to have strength socialist ideals wont survive unless they are supported domestically and internationally.I agree that we should support their right to independence but why should we support a decision to have Russia consume Crimea even if it is the will of  of Crimeans? What about all those people who didnt want to? We should support their right to independence as well....socialism cant be achieved without grass roots independence movements. Unfortunately the situation seems to be more about patriotism and allegiance than independence. Even if a vote was passed in Crimea to join Russia I would support western action to prevent Russia from just consuming them. Democracy is great but on something as big as becoming part of another country its not good enough just getting  of the vote. I would say that there being greatly opposed groups in Crimea Russians and Ukrainians we need to propose solutions that would make the maximum number of people happy either splitting the region between between where the majority of each group lies which I think would be ridiculous and unethical to all the other groups and a big compromise from a socialist standpoint or giving them independence from both Russia and Ukraine.Using Science to work out what is best for the most possible amount of people alongside democracy I think is the way we should be going. Not just blinding following a  system where the rest could represent a huge number.Another poster in this thread said Selfdetermination is the only way we can resolve this situation without the very real possibility of a global clusterfuck. In short let the Ukranians get fucked so everyone else doesnt.No matter what I couldnt accept letting that happen to the Ukrainians just so we can not get fucked for a little longer. We always need to stand against what we see as immoral acts even if that leads to more immediate damage. Because if humanity isnt a species that stands against things like fascism and human suffering what hope do we have for our future? Unfortunately not many governments around the world can be trusted to do this but that doesnt mean some of their efforts cant be good. Dont just say the US or West is just as bad as Russia or whatever and the reverse can apply of course or that they are all imperialists we can still support their actions on a case by case basis on what we see the outcome and over all motive to be.,socialism,cfwlq9o,1,t5_2qjii

I suppose the real question is what contributes more to the inaccuracy of news presenting news as entertainment sensationalising certain issues and overrepresenting problems or is it governmental influence. If the former then institutions like the BBC are preferable if the latter then privately owned media may be preferable. I think it lies somewhere between the two although the entertainment in media is much more contributory. How can you have a media institution present news fairly AND make enough money to pay their journalists and staff. You want something like CBC or BBC but as independent and free of governmental influence as possible. I suppose the answer lies in legislation and laws regarding free speech. ,socialism,cg6moes,2,t5_2qjii

669042,0,t3_21s2nl,I deny that any of those countries were socialist. There can be no socialism in one country. Having socialist in your name doesnt make you one.Secondly there was indeed progress in those socialist countries. Russia made enormous economic progress for example. At the time of the revolution like  of the population were peasants ffs. Why do the leaders of so many third world countries try to follow that model? Because they fucking industrialised in like a generation. To say that there was no progress in these places is just bizarre.Thirdly like capitalism is so great? Lets look at that track record for a second. Currently there are people starving to death. Right now. While you are reading this someone has died of starvation. Meanwhile theres food just sitting there. Food being thrown away. Because food isnt produced for human need under capitalism its produced as a commodity to be sold and the starving cant afford to buy it. Same goes for medicine water in many places transport shelter. There are more empty places in vacant houses and office blocks than there are homeless people. Homes arent for people to live in under capitalism theyre for people to buy so babies freeze to death. Millions die because they cant buy the necessities. Then theres war a fundamental part of capitalism. War on a scale like no one has seen it before. People watch their friends and family get blown up in front of them  and this is a legitimate way for companies to make PROFITS. All the deaths you can point to in the USSR or China or wherever the fuck else happen under capitalism time and time over. Oh the Chinese communists were so evil blah blah blah. Newsflash! Capitalist imperialist powers shit all over that. The British starved  million in one year in China alone  forget the tens of millions more they were starving in India at the time or Ireland before that.  million in a year in one country. Chinese parents swapped their children because they couldnt bear to kill and eat their own kids. Direct consequence of capitalism. That was a bad year though we have good years now.

Rather you are insulting logic.  Remember you believe that everyone had a right to a decent amount of entertainment your words.  What sort of entertainment should that be?  Pornography?  Child porn?  Sponge Bob?  Your leader will decide this for you I guess  by the way can you guess my point here?. You argue like a woman.  On healthcare I clearly say that I am talking about publicly funded hospitals of which we have an enormous amount in the States.  However rather than concede the point you decide to argue something inapplicable choosing to focus on your perception of private hospitals.  Is this a tactic of argument on your part that is based in dishonesty?  Or are you inflicted with some sort of mental disorder that prevents you from maintaining appropriate focus?  You say it all in your last paragraph in which you claim that you just want to help people.  Try to be rational here and think about your statement.  Does that mean that others with dissimilar political perspectives do not want to help people therefore they must want to hurt people?  Does it mean that all you do is justified as long as your intent is to help people?  On that point one can only hope that you are never the leader of a major state as that way of thinking will undoubtedly start World Wars   and !Your statement about just wanting to help people is meaningless and inconsequential in the grand scheme of things though it means something to you.  It certainly does not give you license to try to fuck up the world.  It is inevitable that any socialist state will be administered by a commandcontrol governmental structure.  You the people will not own or control anything rather your government will.  You cannot and will not exist without a state and a government unless the entire world unites in a socialist clusterfuck.  This is of course fantasy.  Any society that exists without government will be overrun robbed and destroyed.  Thus government to some degree is necessary if for no other reason than defense.  But have no doubt the government WILL control property production and all else.  This has not worked out so well for aspiration all Marxists in the past under communistsocialist regimes?  Why?  Because a socialist society pursuant to doctrine cedes too much authority the people which quickly becomes the state.  It always amazes me how gullible people are.  ,socialism,cgnc1w3,-14,t5_2qjii

Youre also not really listening reading or understanding what Im explaining as you keep repeating the same point despite the fact that its explicit that surplus value materialistic not metaphysical value only comes from the workers.Marx explainsgtThe capitalist takes good care that the work is done in a proper manner and the means of production are applied directly to the purpose so that the raw material is not wasted and the instruments of labor are spared. From the instance the worker steps into the workshop the usevalue of his laborpower and therefore also its use which is labor belongs to the capitalist. From the capitalists point of view the labor process is nothing more than the consumption of the commodity purchased i.e. of laborpower but he can consume this laborpower only by adding the means of production to it.Again the capitalist is making profit through the means of production only off of labor power which only comes from the worker. From MarxgtThe product  the property of the capitalist  is a usevalue as yarn for example or boots. Usevalues are produced by capitalists only because and in so far as they form the material substratum of exchangevalue and secondly he wants to produce a commodity greater in value than the sum of the values of the commodities used to produce it namely the means of production and the laborpower he purchased. His aim is to produce not only a usevalue but a commodity not only a usevalue but a value and not just value but also surplusvalue.This only happens because the capitalist can get value out of the worker due to unequal relations greater than value than the sum of the values.gtI know what class struggle isObviously you dont as you repeatedly refuse to accept this fact. Also the labor theory of value doesnt measure values like some microeconomic nonsense that thinks its measuring values when its only measuring prices and profit not value.So yeah technoncrats do not offer value in the Marxian sense of value as surplus value only comes from workers.,socialism,ch40fhe,1,t5_2qjii

During the lifetime of great revolutionaries the oppressing classes constantly hounded them received their theories with the most savage malice the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons to canonize them so to say and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the consolation of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarizing it. Today the bourgeoisie and the opportunists within the labor movement concur in this doctoring of Marxism. They omit obscure or distort the revolutionary side of this theory its revolutionary soul.

1103081,0,t3_26q6os,If you want to stump him try throwing the idea of Surplus Labor at him. Marx obviously explains it better than I can see here but the basic idea is thisWhile making goods a workers first hours are sociallynecessary labor time which is the time required to make enough product to meet the demands of society. Heshe is paid a wage to compensate for this. Anything produced after this is surplus product and is produced through surplus labor. The Capitalist does not need to pay the worker for surplus labor and can adjust the amount of surplus labor by increasing the rate of production or the hours worked absolute vs. relative surplus labor if I recall correctly. The problem with this is that the only way for the Capitalist to make a profit is for himher to pay the worker less than the value of what the workers labor. This leads to the further problems of the Capitalist making money off the workers labor and is brought about by the workers not owning the products of their labor.Like I said this is very simplistic so if you have the time read the chapter of Capital I linked to and the other relevant chapters its dense and boring but informative or online summaries. There are some arguments which the procapitalism guy might be able to use for instance about machines producing labor and such and while their are counterarguments you can research I highly doubt hell be prepared for the Marxist perspective and wont have those arguments ready anyway.

Think about the Robber Baron Eras that have come before.  As Thomas Piketty has stated liberal economist not Marxian  Capitalism leads to inequality.  So the workers wont really look to create a business unless that option is known.And honestly Friedman and Hayek were all about unsettling the labor movements particularly after the s.  So getting them to make businesses that compete with capitalist enterprises is liable to create conflict as the coop movement gets larger.  I do predict that as the capitalist organization remember its about a CEO or shareholders making decisions compete with coop organizations remember workers making decisions I do believe that youll see that conflict begin to influence industries as people make choices on them.  The gaming industry does have something similar like EA versus Valve.  EA runs just like a regular business and people hate them for it.

1176004,0,t3_27l0o3,I do agree with UBI being a part of a greater platform. Your first and second points are valid and I think they are very worthy to raise. As for your third point  of course UBI isnt a cure for anything. However it does give further opportunities for people whom are already reliant or caught on welfare to break out of the common stigmas surrounding their care. This no longer makes them the untouchables of western society rather they can have a voice and this is critical for a proper democracy and furthermore socialism.As for your forth point with regards to political capital I dont think thats necessarily true. I think that the only way that any meaningful change can happen is through a series of small steps and UBI is a rather significant milestone.

1190920,0,t1_ci3kwug,gtYes but as far as the society trying to determine proper proportions of the social division of labor given limited amounts of total labor available their various proportions of necessary labortime does make them have a shared comparable aspect no?Not really. The end goal is the abolition of the division of labor. The reason labor has value is because it is its alienated. If labor were to become lifes prime want theres no need to consider it as objectified in commodities. In terms of social planning there wouldnt be as pressing a need to boil everything down to simple abstract labor. See this is the thing the labors that go into producing a chair and food are entirely different. Theyre really not reducible to some abstract universal yet our society does this. But theyre qualitatively different. So we might have to consider shitty labor like janitorial as being a measure of value for longer but in a state of abundance where people actually find fulfillment in their labor why would we have to equivocate the work of a carpenter with that of a cobbler? We should be more worried about the social relations of the production itself like how much time you personally contribute to producing social surplus and doing the necessary labor to reproduce society not how much is embodied in a good. When you produce a chair in socialism outside of the time thats required of you to labor for the reproduction of society youd do it for selffulfillment and the amount of socially average labor to produce it wouldnt affect how much its worth to you. ,socialism,ci3lif3,2,t5_2qjii

Hell systematic misdiagnosis of mental disability is a common tool in Europe for keeping Roma children in separate schools from the general neurotypical population... and here in the US we stopped using that particular racist tactic decades ago.

1204067,0,t1_ci4zyue,gt Why do small businesses need to profit? Shortages aside could they not simply take what they need from their own stock and sell the rest at cost? Is it literally not possible for them to sustain themselves by selling in country? Or is it the allure of higher profits that drive them to sell across the border? If it is indeed the case that a small business owner cannot sustain themselves by selling within the VZ border then I can understand your concern. However please understand that Im highly suspicious that this isnt the case.Youre assuming theyre only smuggling food across the border among the regulated goods are also electronic items and commodities and many other items. These small business owners cant make a profit for more on this you can google dakazo most of it will be in spanish but you can translate it and get the gist. I would like to explan the whole thing but it would take pages. I understand youre suspicious that isnt the case so let me go a little into depth on why it happens The official dollar rate is about  the price of the black market dollar. The government bases ts regulated prce on the assumpton every business owner has acces to the official rate this of course is not the case hence the existence of the black market. Now say I own a business and import goods to the country. If i get those goods through the official dollar exchange rate I can make a profit of up to  no more because thats the law. I think this is fine. However if I import those same goods using the black market dollar I have to spend  more on them so a profit is impossible Heres a good artiicle that explains the exchange rate. It is a bit outdated but the system is the same. If you read the article and have a basic grasp of economics youll understand the consequences of the exchange rate. If youre still ahving doubts Ill try my best to explain it in depth. Right now I dont have the time but you can also do your own research as there has been many studies done on this. gtNo people should not die hungry. Our country suffers from a very different abuse of labor and each part of the working class is under assault in a different way but yes I do profit from my labor. I do not blame Venezuelans for trying to survive but I do blame those who place personal profit before the welfare of their communities no matter the nationality.I understand and youre right in that that is a common problem here I mean people putting personal profit before their communities. That is a problem among government officials too though. The thing is most people arent like this most people are just trying to get by like everywhere in the world and the fact the government makes it so easy for smugglers and speculators makes me think they are profiting from it too. I have no way to prove this of course so it is another thing that only time will show us the truth. gtI didnt mean it to sound like that. Im trying to say that I believe that global capitalism has a much better propaganda machine and more wellfunded saboteurs than any individual country.I agree. However dont underestimate our governments capability for the same things however mediocre their propaganda actually is compared to the very complex capitalist one For a funny anecdote on this The head of the National Assembly and one of the leaders of the Bolivarian revolution Diosdado Cabello recently showed in his TV show how an opposition General had an arsenal hidden in his home. The picture he shows shows up among the first google images results if you search for airsoft weapons The picture belongs to an arsoft rental store in the US. Thats the kind of thing we Venezuelans have to debunk almost every single week when the government claims theyve found proof of a coup in process. gtI sincerely apologize for my assumption. I honestly do believe though that many of the problems VZ is currently experiencing is the result of an assault on your country by global capitalism which sees you as a threat to its continued existence.I respect your belief that it is an assault but you have to understand why I dont trust a government that claims to be anticapitalist yet sells PDVSA the national oil industry stock to Halliburton. That link is in spanish and I dont know how to translate it so youll have to do it yourself. Also recently the government released proof of a magnicide plan against Maduro which consisted of emails between opposition figures clearly talking about having him killed. They used real headers from their emails with date and everything but changed the text itself. Some of those opposition leaders actually released the emails from their account with the same headers as the ones the government showed but with the original text none of them were conspiracies of course. One of them even challenged the National Attorney to travel to the google headquarters to check the original emails and most of them have already asked the google company to prove those werent the emails sent. The fact that the government actually thought that would hold up shows how little they think of the Venezuelan public and our inteligence. I also believe there are capitalist interest playing a part in this but I bet you theyre mostly just laughing their ass off watching how the government destroys itself and waiting to pick the pieces up through a dictatorship or any other of the shit they have done in the past like flood us with multinationals so they can steal our resources I do want to avoid this but I think the only way to avoid it is a change of government because if the current government stays in line with what they have been doing the country will be unstable enough for the US to justify intervention somehow. Again I cant prove that but I honestly believe this is the case.  Thanks for engaging in real discussion instead of just downvoting me because Im anti Chvez.

1269915,0,t3_28mm98,Scot here. I think at this point pretty much every significant left group supports independence.For me there are a few reasons. It would create a better institutional setup for socialists. The Scottish Parliament is elected via PR which has allowed groups like the SSP and the Greens to gain a foothold  more funding more publicity less tactical voting and an ability to have concrete policies to win people over with while exposing the SNP.  Meanwhile what have we gained in Westminster for the last  years? Galloway? In line with a stronger left wing presence we would be in a better position to resist or even roll back things like antiunion reforms which all the parties in Westminster have pursued for  years and continue to pursue today. If the above proved true Scotland could be both an example to others and a force for good in institutions like the EU Scotland would also gain more seats in the EU as an independent entity. It would weaken UK imperialism. The military would be smaller its funding would be smaller theyd have to rethink their nuclear strategy theyd be weaker in the EU UN and around the world. The SNP has now pledged to stay in NATO but hopefully that could change in future when theyre no longer fighting a referendum. And Scotland would certainly be less keen to openly follow the US.A lot of the debate in Scotland at the moment is along the lines of youd be  betterworse off! but to me this misses the point. Independence wouldnt turn Scotland into a socialist paradise overnight by any means but it would put us into a significantly stronger position. Tactically independence seems the obvious choice.Or to put it all another way if Scotland was already independent would any socialist vote to join the UK?,socialism,cichdbj,5,t5_2qjii

Recognize it was concessions forced upon the state by working class agitation lead by communists and socialists.Yes Im familiar with this history.gt Check out The Case for Reparations for some well researched background on the actual impact of the welfare capitalism Democrats promoted during the th century. Unfortunately the author doesnt recognize this as part of the class war and the intent to sow divisions and stir up racial antagonisms.Well I actually wouldnt be so conspiratorial about the motivations...  the New Deal required the support of the segregationist Southern Democrats to pass.  A lot of it was designed to prevent blacks from being able to benefit from it which was actually meant to reduce racial antagonisms at least on the part of whites toward blacks.  In other words the New Deal tried to cut out blacks in order to satisfy Southern whites.Generally though I dont at all disagree with the contention that the New Deal was designed to save capitalism and such.  Thats absolutely true and an important thing to understand.  Yet the fact remains that it was a concession to the working class i.e. it gave the working class of the time some of what they genuinely wanted which hugely reduced poverty and continues to do so to this day even in its amended state.gt singing into law by a Democratic Party President of the Taft Hartley ActActually the TaftHartley Act was not signed into law by the president.

1350480,0,t1_cilk0yu,gt So I guess you are social democrat and seem to be struggling with this idea of workplace democracyNo I am not. Workplace democracy is good.What I dont see is the necessity for abolishment of private ownership of the means of production. I mean if  workers own a factory and make decisions on whats best for them I dont see the big difference in practice from  stockowners owning the factory. I dont buy the argument about capitalists not being in the community. Sure if you allow such inequalities that capitalists can decouple themselves totally from society thats true. But why on Earth would we let that happen? Social democracies are the most equal countries on earth already. You need regulations and inspectors under socialism and theres no reason why theyd be more effective than inspectors under capitalism. If milk inspectors can make sure milk producers dont make decisions detrimental to safety under socialism the very same inpectors can do the very same job under capitalism. And its not just safety. You can regulate prices wages work hours etc. Nothing is outside the purview of regulation if it is necessary to ensure societys common goals.My other point I bring up a problem. You bring up a solution. Thats fine. But you have to admit that these problems have surfaced already  under capitalism  and the solutions have been brought up already  under capitalism. Theres nothing new here. What I worry about is a movement who has abolishing private property in the means of production as THE goal when the solutions to the problems created by capitalism are the very same as solutions to the problems created by socialism. Its seems that this goal is so allencompassing that it clouds most other issues and even bars otherwise wellintentioned people from participating actively in bringing forth and supporting effective policies.My impression is that this one utopian goal is harder and more harmful to accomplish  and much less effective in realising socialist ideals  than socialists think.,socialism,cilkoey,1,t5_2qjii

There is no evidence to back this up in the argument so leaves it self very weak. If you can provide evidence that people are not lazy or uncooperative then you have substantial weakened the argument.  Then the logic fallows that socialism uses force to try and overcome these inherent qualities of the people.  There is no evidence given that this is actually what all forms of socialism do. It is just presumed that all socialism does is force people to do as it says.  It presumes that all force is bad and justifiable. Which is a very hard to argue when you think about it for a moment.It then goes on to reason that you cannot force people to change that are inherently lazy and lethargic. Thus socialism fails because you just can change people and that is what it tries to do.  first off it is basically implied that the number of lazy people is relevant. There is no evidence that most people are lazy which does not help the conclusion. One could argue that this becomes obsolete as technology progresses to the point where most of the population does not need to work.

Although Marx did have policies he advocated most of his work just details whats wrong with capitalism how to analyze historypolitics as the product of class struggle and a few basic ideas for what a postcapitalist society might look like.Leninism is an extension of Marxism such that every Leninist is also a Marxist but not every Marxist is necessarily a Leninist. Leninism holds that the best way to achieve communism is through the leadership of an elite communist vanguard of professional revolutionaries who would direct the march from feudalismcapitalism through socialism and on to communism. This idea may have been a result of Lenins fear that the revolution would be coopted andor undone by counterrevolutionaries trying to restore old regimes. Leninists are also generally in favor of central planning systems.Trotsky was an outspoken opponent of vanguardism and rejected what he saw as the top down bureaucracy of the soviet union.

Have you ever ascertained which tasks a machine should do? Have you ever expensed production equipment? Do you know how much boring things cost let alone these exciting new machines? Also you didnt address the evidence in real world implementation. Why arent all shopping checkouts self checkout? Why isnt ordering at McDonalds using a touch pad? That doesnt even cover some of the hardest labor to emulate mechanically working with humans and picking vegetables. Yes one day we shall see a golden era of robot slaves but giving someone a living wage isnt going to cause it. While you live and think in the hypothetical youll find most socialists are in the trenches of reality understanding the real reason why labor costs what it does won through struggle not this pure balance sheet of supply and demand curves. If you are right the minimum wage could be because that is how much McDonalds pays in Denmark where they havent been replaced by androids. ,socialism,ckabjki,1,t5_2qjii

1958017,0,t1_cknor1w,Reading this comments chain I understand what youre saying here. It is a concern but its one thats not unique to markets is it? People will always be unequal in some way or another. One person will always be faster or smarter or more practiced when it comes to labor.  hours of labor from Joseph wont be exactly the same as  hours from Karl and it never will be regardless of the labor being done. In that way no one will ever be physically equal no and yoking value to that labor might lead to some eventually severe inequalities.However I actually think a market system can help aggregate that value and smooth out the inequalities when it comes to laborvalue for the whole. If we look at income sharing on a company wide scale say among  workers working  hours each per week. We get  hours of labor each week and we get  units produced and sold at a rate of  per unit. This gives us  a week or  per hour of labor split among the  hours. Thats a  paycheck each week for  hours of labor for each worker.Now maybe Joe on the production line only handles  units a day  hour work day   days a week and Karl in QA deals with  units a day  hour work day  days a week. Joe is doing one job thats needed. Karl is doing another job thats needed. Theyre different jobs they require different traits and skills they deal with a different volume of product but they pay the same  per hour. Labor isnt directly connected to value on the individual levels but on the coop or group level it certainly is. If the workers help the new hires out and get them skilled quickly and efficiently they can increase output and everyone benefits. No one is vying for the cushy supervisor position. No one is sucking up to the boss. They just care about making the best product for the best price in the most efficient way possible because that directly translates to money in their pocket at the end of the week. So each person does what theyre best at and what they enjoy the most.Now where the market comes in is primarily as the motivator for this system. Workers arent going to be hired and fired as disposable units when everything is under worker control. Expanding hiring new people even firing existing employees will have to be decided by the workers themselves because if this is socialism there is no owner or stockholder to answer to other than the workers. Each worker is incentivized to make sure they and everyone else where they work are doing well at their jobs are trained appropriately are safe and are contributing to the whole of the production. Again no bosses no owners no worries about surprise layoffs or being outsourced because profits would be hire in Bangladesh where they can pay  a day for  hours of labor. The only real incentive is to work as well as you can over a reasonable period of time and come home with enough to take care of yourself and your family.As for interindustry equality I think it will actually work out in markets pretty well overall. Especially given todays technology level. Farming doesnt take thousands of people to feed thousands of people anymore it takes dozens of people to feed tens of thousands of people. At that rate of production you can produce large volumes of lowcost consumables so that everything is equitable on both sides of the market. Food costs stay low the people growing the food get paid as decently as everyone else for their time laboring and the labor equalization on a perfarm basis can work just like it does percompany. It could even work on a percrop basis if were talking about a large international market for foodstuffs in the way we currently have large international markets for things like oil. However without people betting on futures buying up things they cant actually use or even store or generally acting like capitalist owners and executives we just have people buying what they need from a grocer or distribution center or local farmers roadside stand so theres no cornering the market on foodstuffs or other goods.Im not saying its perfect. It doesnt directly deal with those who are unable to work through disease or disorder but still need to be cared for. It doesnt deal with government style or taxes or potential welfare systems or anything else. Its not supposed to either. Its an economic system that describes how resources will be used goods produced and distributed and value handled. This seems the most equitable way of transitioning from our current system to one that is at least capable of being called socialist where most people will see that their work has value etc.Central planning has its advantages too. Its undeniable. A smart system would likely incorporate markets with central planning. Capitalists already do that in service to themselves. Theres no reason a socialist society wouldnt want to mix the two systems to greater effect as well. No system is going to make people physically or mentally equal however. Labor and value will always be relative. Right now people who can work Excel spreadsheets have value.  years ago they wouldnt.  years from now theyd likely be obsolete. Thats the fate of every worker. The ploughman and his oxen arent needed today because we have tractors. Tractors might not be needed in  years due to technological advancement. However if you provide labor and value right now you can be decently compensated in an equitable way along with everyone else and without being exploited to make someone else rich. Market socialism can do that. So can central planning. So can various combinations and permutations of the two. Holding on to some ideal valuetolabor translation isnt going to help with that however. Value will change over time through seasons according to technology and tastes etc. The best we can probably do in reality is form a system where labor is rewarded equitably regardless of the real value produced.I think that functionally this is going to be important for people who specialize in academic labor service labor researchbased labor etc. One person might make the breakthrough in some field of research but it takes all the thousands of researchers and peerreviewers and lab techs etc to actually make that breakthrough possible for that one person. In that way all labor is of equal merit. Even in physical production if a new farm hand spends one month screwing up and learning in order to become a better farmhand then whatever gap between the value he created and what he was paid is made up for in the labor he performed by learning his new skills which will pay off in future seasons for everyone who eats the food he raises.I hope that all makes some kind of sense. Were dealing with abstracts here and trying to do so in a materialist way so it can be difficult at times. ,socialism,ckp56e1,1,t5_2qjii

If a boss wants to keep you and senses you might want to quit he will give you some bullshit award employee of the month or best dressed or a raise.

The effort to cloak the US ruling elites plundering of the region in the mantle of human rights has become one of the chief means by which layers of the upper middle class are swung behind imperialist war.

Only when Sharpton explicitly denounced black youth in a pullyourselfupbyyourbootstraps speech did they evince the slightest criticism of him  and even then it was extremely timid. The ISOs entire line  that the Ferguson shooting was primarily a product of the racial composition of the local police force dovetailed with attempts by various figures in the Democratic Party to prevent any discussion of the relation between the events in St Louis the decades long assault on democratic rights and the growth of social inequality and to use the tragedy to promote racial politics.

2266042,0,t1_clrrb9n,Well alright Ill share a few basics.In small elections like this it comes down to whats called retail politics. My candidate was young  and totally unknown but won his primary against five other much more established and experienced candidates because he was kind intelligent personable and people liked him and liked talking to him. All sorts of people came out to the primary to vote for him because they trusted his personal judgment even if they disagreed with his formal issue stances. My biggest piece of advice is to just talk to people facetoface as often as possible even if its not about hotbutton political issues. People would much rather vote for a person than an automated voting machine or even for a faceless candidate in their party line. In a small election like this your biggest asset is them looking down at their ballot and seeing your face and hearing your voice when they read your name next to the check box.When you talk to folks strike a conscious balance between what voters care about and what you care about. Propose and explain and relate your ideas to people but dont do it at the expense of talking about what they want to talk about. A lot of people in the district will care much more about schools and property taxes than minimum wage or about things that dont even concern you like Medicare or Social Security. Tell them what you can do to help in these departments but dont overpromise. People can smell that a mile away. Also be sure to reach out to people in your target group i.e. politically active orgs and ageeconomic groups who you think will support your main ideas and spend a lot of time talking with them since this will be a big voter block for you although there will probably be other candidates to contend with here.Find a person or two who is willing to help you out big time who can help you with behindthescenes work like planning doorknocking maps using voter rolls from past elections that you can sometimes order through the state staying up late signing stacks of sorry I missed you! cards for houses or apartments where nobody is home when you doorknock making election reminder calls putting out yard signs etc. Someone to be your lieutenant. Also put together a small group that can be oncall that can help when you need numbers like that will walk with you in parades which you should sign up to be in that will show up to debates that will help collect signatures for the ballot if you need it and will help you collect donations and get people registered to vote but that wont be in for a huge time commitment. Try to organize a dinner for people like this early on where you guys can get together and talk about the issues and about whats important to everyone. See who cares enough to follow through when you ask them to help. Friends relatives neighbors whoever you think would be interested.I could go on forever so like I said shoot me a PM. But for us for this sized election it came down to retail. Have as many good substantive discussions with as many people as humanly possible.,socialism,clrswk0,9,t5_2qjii

2312415,0,t3_2lqbx1,As someone who has lived in Catalonia and in central Barcelona I have found that the main reasons the Catalan want to leave is because many Spaniards HATE the Catalans. Not all of course but quite a lot. Its a very bizarre hatred that has absolutely nothing to do with the current situation. It has complex historical causes that I dont completely understand but it is a very real hatred. The Catalans feel they have very few similarities with the Spaniards and they feel disliked and that the Spaniards only want them for their money. There are also historical injustices most recently Franco and going all the way back to the destruction of a fifth of Barcelona and the dissolution of the Catalan government by the Bourbons in  at the end of the War of Spanish Succession.

A large number of them see and disagree with the injustice around them but they come to completely different conclusions because they either dont perceive something as injustice or lack context or are the victims of propaganda and preconceived notions.Furthermore they are alienated. And this sort of violence is exactly what the capitalists want  uncontrolled unfocused unorganized senseless violence with which to discredit the enemies of capitalism and with which to further drive up support for the police state which will squeeze out even more of your liberties to give you that security which the masses will be made to think they need more than ever.Like isolated tribes on Polynesian islands they constantly at odds with one another over resources they otherwise would be sharing.

Person X and Person Y both want to make sure the homeless get help but since Y is prochoice and X is vehemently antichoice nothing gets done.We as socialists must fight against this.

It muddles the argument against police use of force. It suggests that the solution is race based. when its an issue with the poor getting poorer It ignores the fact that this happens to ANY race but mainly to people in poor underclasses neighborhoods. The argument should be Police use too much force. Not black lives do not matter.  There is no reason to play the race card in this situation. IF people want to use race in this situation protest city hall not the police station. The police are guys trying to protect us.

They are not something that we should rely on alone.gtAnd I guess as a broader question do you believe in ethical consumerism? I think that ethical consumerism can be useful but it should not be the primary method that socialists should rely on both for the reason that Cyridius gave and for the reason that it is just simply not as effective as unionism. Theres too many variables that ethical consumerism depends upon in order to be truly effective that unionism would not have to deal with. Probably the best example of these dependent variables is competition. In order to have a good boycott you need to have a good competitor that consumers can go to as an alternative. This is especially the case for a necessity such as gasoline or airline service necessity being another dependent variable. These dependent variables can be easily corrupted by different factors such as there being bad competion Ex. I boycott WalMart for treating its employees badly but find out that the competitor that I rely on Target is just as bad as walmart making the boycott pointless and monopolies or oligopolies over a necessity.Again Im not saying that ethical consumerism should not be used at all. It just shouldnt be the primary method used to pursuade corrupt companies to get their acts together.

2704116,0,t1_cnbforo,At that point one has to wonder what exactly these terms mean to him. You may know that Marx himself said that he was no Marxist. Sometimes the problem is more with some of the political and ideological movements that form around terms like these and less about the philosophy itself. For example the scene in which Zenibaba crafts the hair band together with Chihiros friends just screams about adressing the difference between unalienated labour. The hair band serves almost no function although it does in the end show that the whole episode was more than a dream as Chihiro still has it after she escapes from the magical land exept for showing the production process. Still it is interesting that he ties it to writing Nausica. From elsewhere on the pagegt His manga on the other hand explores the darker side of human nature violence hatred anger greed stupidity war and so forth. Still his manga is optimistic in the sense that it shows his strong belief in human spirit and strong will to live.This may have been something that broke his faith in the Japanese communist movements as realistic rather than convincing him of capitalism or that the fundamental philosophy of communism is wrong.  And of course one of the greatest challenges for communists is to find organisational structures in which communism works. There have been plenty of politicians and political movements with the right values but wrong concrete ideas creating for example worker cooperatives that ended in disaster because they were thrown together and organised the wrong way. For example Zizek emphasized this about Hugo Chavez  saying that Chavez made significant moves into the right direction and definitly having the right values but also made technical mistakes like that.,socialism,cnbg4ob,7,t5_2qjii

Che was against worker cooperativesmarket socialism precisely because these forms of socialism are against the Marxian conception of socialism. The Marxian conception includes negating the law of value and the commodity form as Marx laid out in the Critique of the Gotha Programme. Practicing planning instead of markets is the most important economic principle of Marxian socialism after the workers seize control of the means of production.

2762469,0,t1_cnhtf1f,If I can offer my opinion I think there is a confusion.  Zizek is against strict control of the people and surveillance.  He says this pretty clearly in the linked video in his point about biogenetics at min.  He mentions the stated goals for a Chinese biogenetics department and how it is focused control of the people and he says it pretty much terrified me.I think the confusion comes from the fact that that Zizek prefers the strict control of the people seen in China to what we see in the US. He explains this pretty clearly in the linked video from the min mark to the end but I will explain here as well.  Why would he prefer this? Because in the US we are not free as we like to think and instead have only this illusion of freedom.    It is this illusion that is the real problem.  At least the people in China have no illusion about how their lives are controlled.  They know if they speak out against the government bad things will happen to them.  Individuals in the US are controlled in many ways but because of the illusion they cannot see it.  This makes the situation even worse because if they are unable to see and identify the problem then the chances it will ever change are very slim.  Please watch the video from min and I think it will give you a lot of insight to this view. If you care to read on I will offer the point again using another example I have heard from him which made it more clear to me.  Consider the time of slavery in the colonial US.  Who is a better person? The slave owner who beats his slaves and treats them horribly or the slave owner who is very kind to his slaves and makes sure they are happy and taken care of.  Zizek would argue that the kind slave owner is the real villain.  Slavery in itself is a terrible institution so to cover this fact with kindness is to create a lie to cover up the tragedy being committed and would further ensure the slave never realizes the true horror of his situation.,socialism,cni2yyp,20,t5_2qjii

This local action was subsequently backed by the Partys national leadership. The PCF General Secretary Georges Marchais sent an open letter to the Rector of the Paris Mosque justifying the Mayors actions. Marchais noted that he approved of the Mayors refusal to allow the already high number of immigrant workers in his commune to increase. The General Secretary insisted that the Communists were no racists but that immigration was one of the evils created by capitalism. source,socialism,cnnjy9s,3,t5_2qjii

2818155,0,t1_cno34fy,I agree with everything you wrote except this gtCapitalism is destroying the middleclass in its quest for profit.I think for claritys sake we should keep any analysis of capitalism devoid of this term. The term middle class is for all intents and purposes an obfuscation of the facts. There are the workers who do the actual creating in society and the capitalists who leech off the working class by virtue of their privilege to own the means of production. Higherpayed workers along with small business owners and the selfemployed what a liberal would call the middle class are merely a sideproduct of the rising wages associated with temporary labor shortages and imperialism and subsequent raping of undeveloped markets in Africa Asia and to some extent South America. Of course there is a legitimate middle class mostly made up of small business owners and the selfemployed. But when a modern liberal says middle class they are almost certainly referring to the illusion I referred to above of workers who are payed well enough to afford a comfortable lifestyle. That we see the middle class evaporating simply means that the labor shortage is over and competition for jobs will increase leading to falling wages. This liberal notion of middle class can exist and perpetuate itself through state intervention in the form of progressive taxes minimum wages and other welfare programs. We saw this in FDRs New Deal which was essentially a compromise between liberal progressives and the capitalist elite at the expense of radical leftists who drove the Depressionera popular movements in the first place. However I dont see a return to the th century paradigm of wellpayed workers as capitalism completes the process of globalization and the capitalists consolidate their wealth and political power.,socialism,cnof181,4,t5_2qjii

3002190,0,t3_2ukazj,Well starting yourselves out as Communists wont help. I would suggest rationalists off the top of my head. Fighting the bullshit or more acceptable language if your teachers would prefer. Then basically come out with very simple statements. You dont choose which family to be born into. It should only be merit that counts. Everyone deserves an equal chance. Depending on your time scale you can gradually move these along why should the business owner make more money from my work than I do? or just stand on that basic platform. People cant disagree theyll probably be drawn to the fact that reasoning is being shown especially if you can find specific policies of other parties that directly contradict your simple truths.As a first year uni student in what is a reasonably left wing university Im going to advise you now that there is more antileft stigma than you can imagine. Not the commie bastards kind but rather the unthinking oh yeah its a nice idea that I dont understand but it cant work in practice. Ive got that one from a girl who has read the communist manifesto.

3003064,0,t1_co96ctq,Thanks for the detailed response particularly your analysis around Makhno. I wasnt expecting you to put quite so much effort in.Personaly Im very critical of Makhno. Particularly the way he disrupted the war economy by handing out food and money without much thought to broader social consequences beyond the immediate village his army found itself in Im aware he sent grain to the cities in the RSFR even though the Bolsheviks didnt send him arms in return  but the Bolsheviks claimed that it wasnt his prerogative to decide resource allocation at a supranational level during a civil war and I would agree with them and generally his complete inability to theorise socialist development in the Free Territory beyond petitbourgeois agriculture where relations between the peasants and the workers would supposedly be resolved through trade... Saying that he was an excellent commander and the Black army had a lot of impressive victories against larger better equipped foes. Its a pity that it had to end the way it did.Just to get your view why do you think logistics is such a common problem with Anarchist revolutions? Its a key part of any revolution  Proudhon himself acknowledged that even if he was talking about bread as opposed to rifles. The same thing happened in Spain with the CNTFAI who couldnt get access to the materials they needed on the front lines.Personally I would criticise the fetishisation of hierarchy and unaccountable power  the Anarchists in Spain nobly declined to accept positions of civil power in Catalonia during the revolution whilst Makhno rode into a village liberated it and then rode off again  leaving a peasantry prejudiced with petitbourgeois aspirations to decide how best to best organise itself. In both instances power wasnt seized for the reorganisation of society on the basis of securing the revolution  which is what the Bolsheviks managed to do. Yes I agree that under ideal circumstances its completely unacceptable to use coercion to enforce relations of illegitimate authority. Unfortunately in a revolutionary situation sometimes its necessary if people are starving to death in cities sometimes its necessary to requisition grain from the peasantry. If workers councils arent capable of organising production on a national level to meet requirements for the war effort sometimes its necessary to reinstate bourgeois technicians and managers to meet those requirements. Its a tragic temporary defeat but its necessary to avoid total permanent defeat.For me organisation is the main issue here  and you touch on that in your previous post. I dont think its a step too far to see how we move from Anarchist and Marxist theory to very different forms of praxis. Im just curious to hear your view on how these organisational issues might realistically be overcome.,socialism,co99kl6,4,t5_2qjii

3101617,0,t1_cojh32d,I very specifically am against advocating minimum over basic income. Minimum wage just means your employer is that much more likely to replace you with a machine and they might be more reluctant to hire more employees. Also commodities would just adjust in price relative to minimum wage so not much would happen in the long run. E.g. Australia had a decent minimum wage but everything is just more expensive. In a world with machine automation basic income makes so much more sense. Minimum wage is fine but if you are going to prioritize minimum wage over basic income I dont really care too much about your organization.Edit also Im going to call you out on No. . Artificially creating employment is fucking stupid. If machine automation can supply us with all industrial production necessary there is no reason to be obsessed with idea of employment.

Pure labor socialism focuses on dividing work and being inclusive so that less and less demanding jobs are available to more and more people.  However it is also possible to embrace political socialism that does not tightly link material participation in the economy with lucrative enterprises.  In one form this involves sponsoring professional artists athletes etc. so that more people can pursue their dreams while enjoying a share of material productivity.  In another subsistence or even comfort are established as social minima so unemployment is all about hope for achievement or access to special perksincentives.  We can get there . . . the fundamental lesson of economic scarcity is perversely applied to good and services but not natural resources when modern economies actually command an abundance of goods and services while straining scarce resources.

3295954,0,t1_cp3ylay,Thats interesting. See I want to end capitalism too but we dont have a magic way to suddenly make socialism overnight. So we kind of have to build up to it. Part of building up to it will mean taking steps to build workers power and community power so we can really make a serious challenge to capitalism. To build power we can pursue some reforms. Those can be reforms that help with organizing like minimum wage increases. We can also build worker cooperatives and communes to have as bases of power. We can also use government services to help build toward socialism. For example in some places they have a fully nationalized health service that provides free health care to everyone. Actually several countries have that. Obviously none of those things are socialism. But likewise sitting around talking about revolution is also not socialism. If we want revolution we would have to build up to it. We could build up to it by starting with some smaller organizations that pursue reforms like minimum wage increases and stuff.  ,socialism,cp3yrb2,-2,t5_2qjii

3401736,0,t1_cpfwaqn,gtwhat you seem to want to call white culture is at least in the US really a hodgepodge of traits stolen from exploited peoples. I dont know what youre referring to here. While white people obviously partake in massive amounts of cultural appropriation I cant think of any traits specifically associated with whiteness or white people that were themselves appropriated. I fail to see why in and around a white population growing smaller and smaller proportionally and increasingly detached from various historical national identities an identity would or could not either develop or be externally assigned. I dont agree that the phenomenon I am referring to is not the sort of whitepride whitecentric assertion of identity of the historically privileged and currently threatened.  I think its a byproduct of changing demographics and increasingly the shrinking white share of industrial capital and the material shifts in white economic supremacy that have come about as a result. I am speaking from Western Canada and cannot comment with any authority on areas where the white share of capital seems to be staying the same or increasing. ,socialism,cpg0uuq,2,t5_2qjii

The role they were playing was one of policing it was reactionary but they come from a different place and have a different ideology to the modern police force. Theres a reason why some Cossacks could be won over and lots of soldiers were won over while virtually none of the actual Russian police were won over. Most had to be killed they were nearly exclusively on the side of the whites. I only say most and nearly to cover my butt but I am unaware of even a single cop who sided with the revolution.

This means that it is legally considered ASSAULT for a youth to push away a parent who wants to say beat them with a belt because that is the parents right Be denied the right to vote despite paying taxes Be denied the right to work and thus be forced to depend on parents Be paid less than minimum wage Be arrested for sharing pictures of their own body with people the same age Face increased restriction of abortions Be forced to disclose pregnancies to parents Be denied medical treatment without parental permission meaning things that they may want to be kept private especially sexual issues are forced to be known to parents. Be denied agelimited medical treatment such as the HPV vaccine GardasilCervarix or other necessary vaccines despite their desire Be forced to undergo medical treatments despite objections. See young Jehovahs Witnesses forced to undergo transfusion and young cancer patients even some whose parents want treatment to stop forced to undergo chemotherapy Forced to go to schools where they experience bullying.

Competition keeps prices down but discourages competing firms from sharing information that could be used to improve production overall this is the basis of trade secrets.

Granted no single person is the authority but at least they have the perspective.All Socialists should be in a party or organisation and being active in organising. Sanders no Sanders doesnt matter. Thats what we should always be doing no matter whats going on.When you are doing this then you can get the perspective required for what we need to do to move forward as a movement. Only by organising on the ground in reality do you get the moods of workers find avenues for our ideas and find out what the effects of events are on us. Anything else is just abstract and disconnected.Not trying to shit on you or anything but if this is your response to someones views that were not doing anything so eh Might as well do this! it isnt a good one. We should always be doing stuff and even if somehow we werent that doesnt mean we hop on any movement. With that said I think it will be very much worth our time to try and win over Sanders supporters.We need to criticise Sanders expose him where hes bad and show people that they deserve better. We need to be consistent and skillful in how we take up the issue of Sanders. That means we cant just crudely bombard people with fuck Sanders etc as much as many of us may think it. He provides a glimmer of hope for a lot of people and we shouldnt extinguish it but we need to show that the Democratic Party machine is against workers so that when Sanders does fail people realise that theres a need to move outside the Party machine and when the time comes away from Sanders. This doesnt and wont happen on Reddit itll happen when you organise as part of a party and become active in your area.

4098663,0,t1_crngsik,gt No and I read your other response about this. So if your going to browbeat me with individuals when I am also talking on a species level its not really going to go anywhere. Call it biological attachment or emotion or whatever.Okay. Well first of all thank you for saying no as the other person was apparently incapable of doing so. Regarding the distinction of species from individuals the point of this reddit post is to call into question the special status of the human species and of speciesism as a whole. I am contesting that membership of an individual to a species is morally relevant and that is precisely the question that we are seeking to answer by engaging in this conversation.Therefore when you say you support meritocracy of sapience at the species level but not at the individual level within a species and I ask you how you justify this disparity if you appeal to the moral relevance of species membership you are stating the claim in your argument. If you cannot find a way to justify this disparity without appealing to the claim you have an unjustified premise and that is what I am taking issue with.From my side of the fence where speciesism has been abandoned it looks like with regard to moral relevance species are nothing more than collections of individuals who differ greatly from one another but not in some biologically important way that allows them to reproduce with one another. It seems like this biological similarity is irrelevant to the question of whether meritocracy would be just for the members of the species since biological reproductive capabilities seem to be outside the scope of merit they are certainly outside the scope of sentience. If you would take issue with this view go ahead but dont appeal to speciesism itself because thats what is being called into question.gt In response to your next point socialism is radical but it wouldnt require putting the world in a bottle to achieve its goals. Im not going to say you actually support it but the logical conclusion of antisuffering and the like would be the destruction of all things that cause suffering. Socialism on the other hand would cause the destruction of a class and you dont NEED to kill people to eradicate a class.Yes. The end of suffering is the logical consequence of opposing suffering. I do not see why this is a problem as a world where we have ended suffering does seem like a much better world than a world where we have not. I am not sure you do not need to kill people to eradicate a class and I think socialism at all costs except dont harm anyone is probably misguided although naturally Id prefer to see the bourgeoisie entreat with the agents of the revolution and agree after a short dialogue that giving up all of their special privileges would be the right thing to do. As you can probably tell however I dont think this is likely to happen.gt Im curious would you support the destruction of the human race if it was proven we cause more suffering than we could possibly alleviate?Suppose the assumption that the human race causes more suffering than we could possibly alleviate ever. If a morally perfect being were given the choice of pressing a button which could suddenly cause the world to a no longer contain humans b never have contained humans and c enact no harm to the humans who existed before but simply cause them painlessly to cease to exist then a logical consequence of my view is that yes such a morally perfect being would push the button.Would I actually wanna destroy the human race? Not sure because its not such a simple situation as the example I gave above. How can we say for sure the inevitable suffering caused by destroying the human race would be worth it? There are far too many difficulties in considering the relevant policiesactions. I hope that answers your question.,socialism,crnh17b,1,t5_2qjii

The New Deal was motivated in part by radical movements but even Upton Sinclair couldnt win on a Socialist running as Democrat! ticket in  despite that perfect storm.  There were as many or more Francis Townsendtype cranks and lowermiddle class nonradicals who drove the New Deal.

Voting for Bernie matters a hell of a lot more if you are mobilizing people who dont vote because unless there is a THREAT of actual political action the status quo will crush you.

Occupy gets crushed and wafts into oblivion because it didnt generate political firepower while a bullshit topdown movement like the Tea Party lead to congressional stagnation austerity and several states being gerrymandered into oblivion.

You trying to prove youre better than me or something?!Once again missing the point. My point was about taking progressive steps instead of holding out for a miracle to change everything and thats what it would need in England  a miracle. Voting for a socialist Labour leader could make a positive change within a few years compared to attempting to achieve outright socialism in the UK which wouldnt be remotely possible for decades barring another huge financial crisis or mass unemployment due to automation. gtBut yeah the Greens a bunch of cultish militant liberals with new age bullshit mixed in.

Things like guaranteed employment free healthcare quality education for everyone and a guarantee of shelter and food. Even in times of famine the USSR tried its best to feed its population. In its early days it was also the first state to abolish laws against homosexuality birth control and no fault divorce for women. For a short time they even abolished the death penalty granted it didnt last long but baby steps.But at the same time it must be remembered the repressive nature of its governance. There was little if any real political freedom for the average soviet citizen as far as government was concerned. The arts were strictly controlled by the state as was the press and media. Opposing a certain politician could be dangerous even lethal at times.

I would propose that this be run by the state though Im sure there could be other methods of doing so.As for empowering workers there is a simple solution.

4399699,0,t1_csliq7w,Dont know why you were downvoted for asking a question but whatever. To answer your question yes owning a business is a form of exploitation. Keep in mind the word exploitation doesnt have to be a negative thing the word is used often in sports when people say one team exploited the other teams weaknesses and its not meant to be negative. Its just an illustration of what one side did to another. If one starts a business he is looking to make a profit. He hires workers to perform labor and he pays them wages and has other overhead costs. The workers he hired have to produce enough to pay for the entrepreneurs expenses and in addition make enough of a profit for him to have his own income. By doing this he is seeking to get the full benefit off of the labor of others in addition to whatever he brings to the business. This by definition is exploitation. As for businessmen who only hire themselves they are very much in the minority to the point were they have a small impact on the market. Exploitation gets a negative connotation with respect to capitalism because there are a multitude of examples of malpractice by capitalist enterprises starting in the th century up to the present with child labor bringing in thugs to break up workers strikes pollution unsafe labor conditions and low wages that are substantially lower than the value of the workers production. ,socialism,cslkwrs,8,t5_2qjii

What you call socialist homophobia is entirely a conservative retreat from Lenins line. But put that asideeven if it werent a betrayal of Lenin it would still be wrong! Its wrong when fascists do it it was wrong when the RCP did it. What we learn though from the era of Lenins leadership is that homophobia was not some deep entrenched value as you portray it but rather that revolutionary Russia was ready to overthrow its traditions and build a better society. The reimposition of conservative values during Stalins time was a topdown process that involved the introduction of new laws new institutional structures and a new ideological line.

4421045,0,t3_3bnaj2,Firstly we need to differentiate between concessions by the Capitalist class towards existing struggles and actual liberation socialism. These concessions arent all too bad public schools health care minimum wage laws and many other Liberal things were won by Radical comrades. But the reason Liberals gave up those concessions was not because they were socialist or genuinely cared about our struggle it was in order to maintain control and pacify the masses and stave off a total defeat of the system. So while we support public schools and stuff we should also recognize why they were given to us in the first place.Secondly socialist society places the people and their liberation at the forefront of society. Franz Fanon in his book The Wretched of the Earth uses the slogan the Last shall come First in order to express the way the oppressed masses are able to see genuine change in social structures that affects them. While a concession does give something to the last they still are not in command of those changes public schools are gutted by the capitalist class in crisis for example or are used to spread bourgeois ideologies . Only when oppressed people are in command of their communities their education their healthcare ect. and are not dependent upon CapitalistLiberal concessions will we know socialism has been realized. ,socialism,csnzjah,5,t5_2qjii

The arguments i made only apply to property in natural resources and property that commands an income from its title that is property in social means of production  they do not apply to products of labor that cant command an increase such as food. The ownership of buildings so long as it is founded upon use rather than title and hence cant command an increase i.e there is no rent likewise is possession rather than property. My arguments were a critique of the entitlement theory that you support not a complete rejection of any entitlement theory in general or a rejection of the ability to own anything at all that would also be an absurd position.Possession founded upon labor and usufruct is a matter of fact. Property founded upon a class society and hence upon law relies on the force of the State and changes with every different mode of production. Paraphrasing Marx we do not wish to stop people from appropriating the products of society but we do not allow them to subjugate the labor of others by means of such appropriation. Paraphrasing him some more in abolishing private property over means of production land and capital we will make individual property over the products of labour a reality.,socialism,csyjwf4,2,t5_2qjii

They are improving at a very slow rate with slidebacks in a very few places parts of SubSaharan Africa for a host of reasons but to discard all that technological progress new infrastructure communication etc... in the extremely low odds of a revolution leading to positive chance.  Well I think thats madness.  If the vain hope of revolution makes you happy then fine but there has been a ton of meaningful reform that has led to better lives for a substantial portion of humanity and ignoring that in a utopian dream that revolution soonnow will be better is tragic and not really respectable.

4557024,0,t1_ct50fmm,gt The metaphor of the waterboarding both uncovers and hides the truth of what happened at the Eurogroup first and at the Eurosummit later. It is a powerful metaphor for the cruelty and the mental torture to which Tsipras was subject and this is a perfectly good reason why we should use it. The EU lost what remained of its reputation on Sunday. The metaphor however also hides the truth for there is a decisive dissimilarity between what happened on Sunday and an actual waterboarding Tsipras had the freedom to leave the room. He could have chosen to break with his torturers. The fact he did not do it is only partially an outcome of relations of force. And it is not the symptom of some form of personal opportunism as Tsipras is hardly going to gain something from this on the long run and perhaps even in the short one. In this sense the comparisons between Tsipras and the Italian Bertinotti or Vendola who decisively contributed to destroy the Italian radical left are misplaced. Tsipras decision to stay and capitulate is rather the final outcome of a gigantic analytical and strategic mistake it is the symptom of a specific political strategy which revealed to be entirely inadequate to the situation. Tsipras beatendog face reminded me more of the selfsacrificial attitude of Enrico Berlinguer. And they have some aspects in common notably the combination between a fundamental mistrust in the working class and its selforganization and an exaggerated trust in the democratic propensity of their counterparts as well as in their willingness to compromise for the common good.

These things are largely inevitable and will happen whether or not the wage is raised. If increases in minimum wages do have a noticeable effect it will more likely be the movement of capital to areas with weaker worker protections.But I agree with you overall. Piecemeal improvements to capitalism without accepting that capitalism is fundamentally flawed allow arguments that rely on capitalist values to have weight. If we accept capitalism we must accept profit as a goal. If we reject profit as a goal we must reject capitalism.,socialism,cthk2cb,2,t5_2qjii

If the goal of this campaign is to focus attention to the working class this is not the most practical way of doing it.At best its an ineffective strategy. At worst its radical social democratic revisionism as uperlevy pointed out. For example the Black Lives Matter movement got more press by jumping on stage at a SandersOMalley event than they would have if they held a separate event. Why not do something similar?

4686361,1,t3_3f3rt3,The public need to move towards the left before any serious inroads can be made against the rule in this country by finance capital. The public are already in favour of leftist policies like nationalisation but they lack the class consciousness to select a nonbourgeois party at the elections. This could be remedied by turning a bourgeois party into a workers party. Im speaking of course of the left faction in Labour who look about to elect Corbyn as the leader of the opposition. I think democratic leftists should think seriously about Trotskys idea of transitional demands and trying to achieve socialism through a combination of parliamentary and revolutionary action.If Corbyn is elected as leader of Labour leftist parties like TUSC and the CPGB should try to become affiliates inside it in order to solidify it as a genuine socialist party with a mass base amongst the proletariat. The reaction from the Labour careerists will blow over and they will split off into one of the other bourgeois parties. At that point we will be closer than ever before to socialism in Britain. So my advice to you specifically is to look into joining the Labour party. If Corbyn isnt elected or the reactionaries manage to eject him and the other leftists then it will back to the drawing board but Im really hopeful. ,socialism,ctl9e6t,-4,t5_2qjii

This is correct. Its one thing to critique identity politics. Its another to use the term as a vehicle for denying racism and sexism or denying the relevance of those struggles to the overall socialist project. That is the distinguishing factor between what is acceptable and what is not.And frankly I dont think its that hard to distinguish between the two.

It may be that I have a kneejerk reaction to Salon in particular but the issue I found with the article and ones similar to it is its appeal to a return of this postwar United States that was the result of New Deal policies where wages and profits were simultaneously high. I think part of our job as socialists is also to educate people as to why the material conditions such as the liquidation of value from the Great Depression going into the nd World War do not exist anymore for liberal social democracy to thrive on like it once did. This isnt to say we shouldnt be on the fronts with the working class or as working class people ourselves in all facets of the class struggle but liberal arguments like the ones in articles like this will ultimately do little to bring working class consciousness because they always carry with it the assumption that we can simply patch up our economic system to serve the people better. ,socialism,ctsictg,3,t5_2qjii

No there was but one free and fair election in  that the communists led by Ho Chi Minh swept by a huge marginThe Geneva Accords which ended the Vietnamese war of independence from the French in  stipulated that there would be a temporary division of the country into north and south for  years and elections would held in both north and south to create a national unity government whose task would be to finally reunite the country. The U.S. never signed the accords and used that to support the Diem governments decision never to hold those elections. Instead Diem held a rigged referendum to legalize his decision to become dictator of a permanent South Viet Nam.Now there were certainly atrocities committed by the NLF and the VCP so its not wrong to say either force was kind of terrible.

4939173,0,t1_cuh3ujg,gtThe USSR had a system that called StateCapitalism. This is here the state fills the role of the capitalist but instead of prioritizing profits it prioritized the welfare of society. There were also Workers Councils where the word Soviet comes from that had a easy in what the workers did. They did this because at the time Russia had been through a lot of shit The Great War RevolutionCivil War industrialization all the work they had to do to transition to socialism and the people would not continue to support the Bolsheviks if they said Okay guys we just need another  years of hard work until weve fully converted. So Stalin told everybody that they had Socialism to keep them happy and not put them through even more stress.gtBut then Khrushchev came started reforming every thing to be more along the lines is Social Democracy think of Sweden and I among others despise him for that.Thanks for this but when did the Soviets who were anti capitalist ever describe themselves as capitalists?  Why would you bemoan someone for trying to be like Sweden?  I thought that was considered by many to be one of the most egalitarian and wealthy countries in the world?gtWell it is highly debated whether or not all of these were actually socialist. Again USSR might have had statecapitalism. China started revising their system and they have not besn socialist for years.Then is there anything that has existed or does exist that is universally considered socialist?gtBut I know for a fact that North Korean and Khmer Rouge communism is a complete lie. These two regimes are anything but communism both in theory and in practice. NK had Juche which is practically monarchy. Pol Pot just straight up committed genocide and did nothing to build socialism. They were communist in name only.But why did they call themselves as such then?gtLiterally let everyone choose their job and what they go to school for. Education is freesuper affordable in socialist society so everyone gets to go. The USSR for example did let people choose what job they wanted to get as long as they did well in school cant have a dummy operating a nuclear power plant!This is fair enough but how does one control quality like you cant just have people who dont have the intelligence for university in can you?gtIt depends on which freedom. The freedom I want is to be free of exploitation by capitalists and free of poverty and classism if youre poor you dont have many options in life. I guess you want Freedom of Speech as described in the US constitution and all that stuff that Americans sank over. Personally I prioritize people not being poor over freedom of speech because freedom of speech is uesles if youre starving and homeless so Im okay with a government that censors capitalism and fascism. But in a new socialist nation we might decide that you still get freedom of speech even if you say horrible things that undermine socialism and encourage people to revert back to capitalism or even worse fascism.Yeah but you cant ameliorate poverty or any condition if people arent free to organize and agitate and call for reforms to change remove it.  Also whats the point in living if youre not free?  If I was a well treated slave Id still ask to be shot in the face to put me out of my misery.  Or just rebel PHow would censorship work then?gtSome people do want to do that actually. Its called Democratic Socialism which is completely different from Social Democracy dont confuse them where socialism is achieved through politics and democracy. Personally I dont think this is possible but hey Id someone does manage to do it awesome!Oh?  Can you point me to these groups?gtThank you for taking the time to actually learn by the way.

4951370,1,t3_3ip2gu,I have a few theories on this. Now if the whole world isnt socialist and the hypothetical socialist country in question is developing i.e. third world such as the DPRK Laos Vietnam etc. then I would say a strict hierarchical military is desirable. It would not be democratic because if soldiers of a higher rank are accountable to soldiers of a lower rank then tough drill sergeants for example could be removed in favor of a more amiable one and this will degrade the efficacy of the military in question. Imagine if Che Guevara had been held accountable for his incredibly brutal style of military leadership? Developing world socialist militaries are going to have to be several times more disciplined and vigilant in order to deal with their capitalist enemies that currently have the advantage in society. Capitalism forces many people of the working class to conscript because of economic pressure. This means that a voluntary socialist military would be several times smaller than a military formed in a capitalist country so I would say conscription and service should be mandatory of all citizens in developing socialist countries.First world socialist countries should invest heavily in technology and eliminate the need for a trained military. Obviously I mean a military in a developed socialist country would make heavy use of drones and other autonomous weapons systems AWS. I would otherwise abolish the military completely in a developed country and just put resources toward a military into technology thats just me. If the entire world is socialist abolish the military it wouldnt serve a purpose in an international socialist collective. ,socialism,cuinr8o,1,t5_2qjii

5023829,0,t1_curc3p5,gt One first of all has to see why the sailors of Kronstadt occupied an asset instead of continuing to be a valuable force within the revolution. This is because their demands to the revolutionary government werent met. When you take a look at these demands you see that they were purely libertarian socialist in nature and derived from communist thought.And if the list of fifteen demands were issued during peacetime you would be hard pressed to find a single person who would disagree with the demands.The issue is that you cannot carry out war on a national scale with the threat that every few months parts of the military commit mutiny in order to demand better conditions and a wholesale reorganisation of national command and control structures from a position of strategic ignorance. gtThey werent unreasonable material demands either as it was mostly about ideologically liberty.Some of them were entirely unreasonable in the context of a war such as  below. Others such as the equalisation of rations among workers were much more reasonable.gtgtDemand  Immediate new elections to the Soviets the present Soviets no longer express the wishes of the workers and peasants. The new elections should be held by secret ballot and should be preceded by free electoral propaganda for all workers and peasants before the elections.What would have happened if a garrison of the Royal Navy mutinied and issued demands that elections be held to appoint a new cabinet during the middle of WWII because they rightly assessed that Churchill was a complete bastard? Not to be glib but you simply cannot wage a successful military campaign if the pieces on your chessboard refuse to move or do what they want.Again Ill stress that this isnt a matter of whether the demands are right or wrong in the abstract of course theyre correct in the abstract its whether they were correct to make the demands at that point in time under existing material conditions. You and others would argue that assessment of the Krondstad sailors was correct that the present Soviets no longer express the wishes of the workers and peasants. I would argue the opposite that winning the war is the most important interest of the workers and peasants all other interests are secondary in light of such an existential threat. Would the workers have been allowed to form Soviets if the war had been lost? No. Would the peasants have been allowed to keep their newly seized land had the war been lost? No. Regardless of your view on how things evolved after the war  I dont think anybody here would wish for a White victory.Yes the trees were stripped of bark for  miles around Petrograd as the workers had to grind the bark down to mix with their flour rations. Was that in their interest to do so? No. Yes the peasants had their grain requisitioned in order to feed the workers in the cities workers who were operating the factories necessary for the production of war materials. Was it in their narrow self interest to see their hardearned grain requisitioned? No. Yes the armed forces were placed under the iron control of Trotsky and the Bolshevik political commisars. Was it in the interest of the soldiers to find themselves fighting once again under their old officers with the same command structures now with a political commissar telling them how to think? No.Are any of the above examples instances of what people signed up to when they saw the potential for a revolutionary government? No. Did these actions enable the Bolsheviks to win the war thus laying the foundations for a stable political climate in which a revolutionary government could operate? Yes.Its beyond absurd to think that one might immediately transition to a socialist mode of production during a period of total war or that such a transition is the most important and immediate task during said period. If a critique of Bolshevik policy during the civil war as per Kronstadt amounts to they werent building Socialism or the demands by workers and peasants for immediate socialist reform of production relations werent being met Im afraid that at best its not a particularly thoughtful critique at worst its implicitly destructive in light of the fragile system of national production which just about kept the war effort on its feet over the five year period.,socialism,curk9og,3,t5_2qjii

5117997,0,t1_cv2wpz4,Maybe this will help explaingtCapital is in the first place an accumulation of money and cannot make its appearance in history until the circulation of commodities has given rise to the money relation.gtSecondly the distinction between money which is capital and money which is money only arises from the difference in their form of circulation. Money which is acquired in order to buy something is just money facilitating the exchange of commodities. Marx represent this as C  M  C or Commodity  Money  Commodity. On the other hand capital is money which is used to buy something only in order to sell it again. Marx represented this as M  C  M. This means that capital exists only within the process of buying and selling as money advanced only in order to get it back again.gtThirdly money is only capital if it buys a good whose consumption brings about an increase in the value of the commodity realised in selling it for a Profit or M  C  M.,socialism,cv2ws16,1,t5_2qjii
5119196,0,t3_3l3zd9,Liberalism is essentially the attempt to soften capitalism in order to prevent revolution. I think its actually worth praising because it could provide a more graceful and possibly completely legal and peaceful transition to a socialist society. Less people have to die in riots or of starvation.Socialism is perhaps always radical in theory but certainly not always violent nor is it only achieved outside of traditional institutions. In fact Karl Marx himself has said that the Untied States and England and perhaps the Netherlands having such particularly democratic governments could transition rather painlessly into socialism.,socialism,cv31zpt,9,t5_2qjii

5155229,0,t1_cv79dxv,gtNo communists are people who think that this is impossible to do through reform and is only doable via revolution. This ranges from your classic MarxistLeninists to anarchists which should make it clear that the idea that communism is totalitarian government control is false.This is really not accurate at all. What you are describing is reformism vs radicalism while I would be willing to say there are very few reformist communists they have and still do exist. Reformism are those that think capitalism can be gradually reformed into socialism via voting or whatever legal means exist in liberal democracies. Radicalism thinks there must be a radical shift from capitalism to socialism without a continuum between the two. It is actually possible to not be revolutionary and still be a radical but it is a rarely held view.Communism is explicitly a classless stateless moneyless society where the economy is controlled collectively. Socialism is simply an economy that is controlled by the working class. ,socialism,cv7ebeo,1,t5_2qjii

5216200,0,t1_cve2nal,Ive been very poor. Now Im... well not rich still living from payday to payday but Im able to actually afford to eat every evening and pay my bills. Being very poor you absolutely cannot plan. Odds are you are relying on some form of benefit payment  so youre utterly screwed from the start. Someone at the Job center or whatever the US equivalent is WILL fuck up your claim. Try being honest and claim that three days part time work you did? I tried this on two occasions. Your benefits claim gets put on hold then it is supposed to be used as a topup to the level of benefits you were supposed to receive. What actually happens is this  your benefits do not get paid  you call up and it turns out that the claim has not been processed. Youve now got no money and a fortnight to go before you get any more. You take out a crisis loan  which then you have to repay out of your benefits that are not quite enough to live on anyway. Then Housing Benefits gets in touch because your circumstances have changed  leading to yet another month long delay in getting anything sorted and your rent going unpaid in the meantime. Given the chronic lack of staff at HB and JCP odds are that some undertrained underpaid and overworked desk jockey is going to loose your details at least once. I rarely had a claim sorted out smoothly.Oh and of course youre paying tonnes more for electric because youre using a prepaid key  scratch that  because you can never know how much money you will have in your account at any given time you absolutely cannot set up a direct debit. Damn near everything works out cheaper with direct debit payments and you cant set them up for fear of not having enough money to meet them and getting a bank charge on top of everything else. . charges might not seem that much when youve got money but when youre poor that could eisilly be your food budget for the week.On top of that  say an appliance breaks down? Sure you could get financing for a new decent washing machine that might last four or five years. Oh except you cant  because you cant make the repayments. What you do instead is beg and borrow from relatives until youve got  to buy a cheap second hand model that is going to break down in a year. You got an interview? Thats brilliant! Of course you get paid in arrears  and of course youre going to have to get the bus there if you get the job which is going to cost a fortune. Obviously there are discretionary payments made by the job center. Unfortunately noone who works there will tell you about them you have to ask. And of course noone who works there really knows how anything much works as the staff turnover is so damn high so you might not get them in time anyway. When youre poor you cant plan for shit in the long term but get outstanding at planning in the short term. Your income usually fluctuates wildly you literally do not have enough cash to meet all your outgoing payments ever. Your horizon shrinks to When I run out of the small amount of money I have right now  usually a week at most.This means that if by some stroke of luck you find a tenner lying around that you do not have to immediately use right this moment you spend it on something fun. Know why? Because you cant save that tenner or use it for anything useful. You owe so much money so many things need fixing or sorting and you have no idea what will happen next week that frankly putting that tenner aside is pointless  you might as well not bother because it will make no difference. Youll still be flat broke by the end of the week regardless so you go out buy something nice for dinner or a bottle of something perhaps and get to feel like a human being for an evening.EDIT Ive actually found it a little hard to adjust to having a steady income and plan for more than a weeks time. Poverty is a very hard mindset to get out of. I genuinely understand why poor people who suddenly become very rich sometimes blow it all in months  its because you get into the mindset where you cannot plan for the long term. Thats my experience anyway. ,socialism,cveqtf1,8,t5_2qjii

5410699,0,t1_cw38rc3,In part its a leftover from Cold War propaganda that equated democracy with free enterprise and contrasted rugged individualism with collectivism. In another part it derives from the economic theories of F.A. Hayek who posed that government intervention in the market and welfare programs destabilized some mythic ability of the market to selforganize Adam Smiths invisible hand and thus became de facto socialistic.The big irony is that for the majority of the Cold War America and Western Europes economies were constantly intervened at with high taxation levels and welfare programs. For the Cold War liberals Daniel Bell Arthur Schlesinger J.K. Galbraight Walt Rostow Zbigniew Brzezinski etc the ability of the state to assist markets showed the superiority over the capitalist West over the communist East. After this system went into crisis around  the inability to maintain social welfare programs with the cost of Vietnam combined with the collapse of the postwar Bretton Woods agreement the door was open for the theories of Hayek and more specifically Milton Friedman to attack liberalism with what is now referred to as neoliberalism. It took a while to catch up finally breaking through in America with Ronald Reagan and in England with Margaret Thatcher. The current equation of welfareregulationtaxation with socialism is the very strategically deployed bastard child of these developments.,socialism,cw39yry,2,t5_2qjii
5411945,0,t1_cw3f0cu,Im sorry but youre the one whos spreading the bullshit and it isnt even new. Ive heard this before time and time again often times by nonMuslims who dont even have a basic understanding of Islamic political thought. I mean Wahhabism? Can you possibly explain what that is exactly? Who it came from? Why is it called what it is called?When I speak of Islamism Im talking about a certain strain of political thought born as a reaction to the failures of both capitalism communism and nationalism of both of those things. Im sorry you cant figure out that the world is just a bit more complicated than you think it is. Pertaining to Sayyid Qutb yeah Im aware that hes taken out of context by ISISlike men all the time now a days. But bring the guy himself back to life and hell tell you that blowing up the twin towers or enslaving Yazidi women was never what he had in mind for the Muslim world. Hell look at this quote from his book MilestonesgtIslam does not force people to accept its belief but it wants to provide a free environment in which they will have the choice of beliefs. What it wants is to abolish those oppressive political systems under which people are prevented from expressing their freedom to choose whatever beliefs they want and after that it gives them complete freedom to decide whether they will accept Islam or not.,socialism,cw3fopi,4,t5_2qjii

On top of that a lot of the issues that face women are tied to capital so freeing them of that economic barrier makes perfect sense. Saying that people should be judged and given opportunity regardless of gender is like saying Everyone should be given the opportunity to finish a race but well just completely ignore the fact that some lanes are clear and some lanes have hurdles and some racers are carrying heavy burdens.

5558461,0,t1_cwleul0,The problem with liberal democracies is precisely the nature of the drive for profit in capitalist society. My country Australia is a good example.  In the s and s when our unions won better wages and conditions as well as some of the social democratic political demands commonly espoused  free education more substantial welfare state etc. The ruling class can tolerate this in bosom times but when the profit rate begins to fall the ruling class cuts back on this expenditure the whole logic of neoliberalism and takes hold education cuts welfare cuts etc. To say that the limits of your demands and action must be to gain some social democratic demands relies on a misunderstanding of the dialectical relationship between capital and labour. As well as this if we limit our demands to political ones within the framework of capitalism we limit ourselves when the class is taking action and developing its conciousness our orientation must beto intervene best so as to direct that conciousness to a revolutionary conciousness while we are winning demands is the best time to mobilise for further demands  to strike while the iron is hot. ,socialism,cwm2tja,1,t5_2qjii

5656564,0,t1_cwy6122,gt I am not quite convinced of the universality of that principle from a single anecdote. Puerto Rico has many other factors affecting its economy than a minimum wageIndeed true there are many factors in an economy that can cause job loss.  However if you were isolate out only the effect of the minimum wage rises then you will see that there are fewer jobs as a result of it than there would have been without it.  Here is a more recent case  Seattle is slowly transitioning to a  minimum wage.  How can we analyze the effects of raising the minimum wage?  By analyzing the industry that is disproportionately affected by it  The restaurant industry.  This analysis has been done and has found  gt . The loss of  restaurant jobs in May following the minimum wage increase in April  was the largest one month job decline since a  drop in January gt. In contrast to the JanuaryJune loss  of restaurant jobs in the Seattle area a restaurant employment nationally increased by  jobs and by . during that same period b overall employment in the Seattle MSA increased . and by  jobsgt. NonSeattle MSA restaurant employment in Washington increased . and by  jobsSource  Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute.  Time still needs to pass to fully analyze the effects in Seattle this is simply analysis of the results so far.  Also perhaps anecdotal a number of Seattle waiters and waitresses have noted smaller tip sizes due to the perception that they are already making hr not true for another few years.  gtRegarding the McDonalds story technological displacement is happening and will continue regardless of wages. If there is an effect from wages I believe it is only in a marginal effect on the timeline.It has a lot to do with wages.  If the minimum wage increases too high the greedy capitalist will find ways to save money which includes automating labor done by humans.  You dont have to pay a machine minimum wage only maintenance costs and it does the same things McDonalds employees can do.  gtSo I am not so certain that labor can adapt in the same way from this as it did in the case of a shift from agricultural employment.Indeed there is a lot of uncertainty going into the future.  However I trust in human innovation.  The internet has created millions of jobs.  Could any economist have predicted that a few decades ago?  No.  We do not know what human innovations will occur that will change the landscape of labor availability.  Technology will automate many jobs for us.  I dont think this means everybody who lost their job to a machine will just sit around and wait for death.  They will seek opportunity.  They will specialize they will find ways to contribute.    ,socialism,cwy92p6,1,t5_2qjii

The idea was that you had to avoid them in order to do the mission successfully but she took a video where someone had gone up to them and killed them and dragged their dead nearly naked bodies around and then went on a rant talking about how the game was awful and sexist because the women were put there for the male protagonist to kill and use their bodies for the players sexual enjoyment. Of course no player actually does that although it is possible it hurts you in the game by making you lose points or something like that. So yes this sexist content was in the game but it was only one scene out of a much larger game and she tried to paint it as though the whole game was like that.Meanwhile there are games like League of Legends which although being a very fun game unfortunately needlessly oversexualized pretty much every single one of its female characters in a way that is obviously pandering to a primarily young male audience.So although her heart seems to be in the right place there are some times when she either knowingly blows things out of proportion to appeal to those who dont actually play the games or she genuinely just isnt knowledgeable about the games she criticizes. I think there was also some quote where she said she didnt like most video games because they were too violent or something like that so the concerns about her in that regard may be true. I would not be surprised to find out that she was only ever in it for the money or attention and doesnt really care for video games too much.,socialism,cx6lksj,2,t5_2qjii

The rulers shouldnt be killed but given an appropriate punishment. And if there is a death penalty then they will die. This is the least I could ask for as a Christian.That said personally I think that everyone can be forgiven especially if they are victim to a basic flaw in the human psyche find themselves born at the end of a barbaric period in human history only in a wealthy position because of circumstance of birth and play a very very small part in defending an arbitrary economic system. If theyre a reactionary counter revolutionary force after the revolution itself then by all means punish them appropriately but if not then theres no real need to.

The first is it forces them to pay their workers more or face open rebellion like what happened throughout the world at the beginning of the s. The second is related because it allows them to pay a sharecroppers wage. They arent free they arent able to invest nor do as they wish but they are forced into labor and to buy from those that employ them.

5962608,0,t1_cy17equ,The idea that autonomous infrastructure cant challenge capitalism is not something I agree with and in fact the idea of socialism becoming a reality without new infrastructure is foolish in my opinion. In Principles of Communism its made explicitly known that capitalism could not have happened if it were not for the Industrial Revolution the creation of the factory system and the division of labor. And the only reason why this transition happened is because the advent of these new developments lead to a system that was widely efficient at producing large amounts of products at extremely cheap prices which is what drives the market and is why the market survives. I do not feel that we can take the principles of socialism and successfully implement them through the infrastructure of capitalism. Socialism needs its own technological revolution and part of that revolution includes distributed networks and the Internet.Socialism is literally where the workers own the means of production. In extremely large ways the sharing economy already achieves this. Every driver for Uber already owns all of the capital needed to perform the labor the car. What they dont own is the network that facilitates the management and cooperation between the drivers. Yes purchasing a solar panel gives someone money. Purchasing a car gives someone money. Purchasing my home gives some one money. But the marginal cost production of the energy from the panel after you own it is zero. The cost of renting out your car particularly if it runs on renewable energy is zero. The cost of renting out your home and acting as a hotel after you own it is zero. After you own a D printer the cost of production of manufactured goods runs down to near zero.The entire point is that with personal infrastructure  solar panels and turbines indoor hydroponic food systems mesh networks and community ISPs decentralized internet platforms powered by workers etc.  that we can a create individual human beings who are autonomous in their survival and b create scalable networks of distributed production and infrastructure that can be run more democratically more efficiently and cheaper than the current infrastructure that supports capitalism. Centralization is extremely expensive insecure and inefficient. I think that until capitalism because less efficient than production through socialist infrastructure it will never happen. And no bitcoin farming is one aspect of how blockchain technology works. Just the same I believe that cryptocurrency can do an extremely good job at battling capitalism. It is literally the decentralization of the means of producing money.and the stateclass it protects will just look idly by while this happens?Im sorry but in what possible scenario are going to discuss the development of socialism without retaliation from capitalism. Of course they wont  thats not the point. But what is the other option if not making capitalism technologically obsolete? Armed revolution? Good luck.a You cannot end value. Things in the real world have value even beyond capitalism. A banana has value because I can eat it water has value because it keeps me alive time has value. You cannot separate value from a physical world. It ends exploitation by ending dependency.

6010019,0,t3_3xrux9,I like this wellthoughtout post although as a person with Aspergers or at least someone whos been told that all his life I would disagree with it on several points.Firstly on the video I find it very implausible that the neurotypical view of walking down the street is anything approaching reality.  There is simply no possible way that someone could simply casually walk down such a busy city street without hearing any noises nor even briefly looking at one of the myriad of shiny objects strewn about the environment.  It feels like they just took a normal walk kept the camera pointed in one direction turned the brightness down and muted the volume... although come to think about it that would explain why all of the normal people around me seem to like sunlight and loud music so much.With regards to politics I actually havent had nearly as much problems from conservatives as I have had from liberals in the American sense.  Back in the days when I hung out on liberaloriented websites I routinely heard autistic used by liberal feminists as a snarl word to refer to libertarians.  For some reason autismAspergers appears to be the only disability that can be used as an insult without it being ableism Ive heard MRAs claim that this is because autism predominantly affects men but Im fairly sure that thats not the actual reason.I never quite understood all of the people who argued that autistic people are just faking a disability in order to freeload.  Some people would frequently lecture me on how its wrong that autistic people use their disability as an excuse to misbehave and expect everyone to bend over backwards to accommodate them and I always get confused in these conversations because Ive literally never observed what theyre talking about.  Quite the reverse in fact... Myself and all of the other autistic people I know strive to be independent and never freeload from others as a matter of principle whereas while were mulling about our own business some neurotypicals will come up and demand that we behave in a certain way in order to satisfy preferences and rules that they made up.Yeah autistic peoples talents are definitely squandered in our society although Im not sure how much I agree with the idea that one of our talents is compassion and sensitivity.  Theres a difference between sensitivity to physical sensations and sensitivity to social subtleties.  Also I could be wrong on this but Im pretty sure the defining trait of sociopathy isnt that they arent sensitive to other peoples emotions but that they are sensitive to other peoples emotions and manipulate them for their own advantage.I definitely share your perceptions on the social justice movement except for the part where they believe that kindness is weakness  I dont think Ive ever seen that claim from someone who identifies with that camp.  Most of them seem to have a superficial commitment to kindness while not actually doing anything to advance it.  But the part about allowing minorities a place within capitalism without abolishing capitalism itself spot on I think.,socialism,cy7g04y,6,t5_2qjii

6014988,0,t1_cy7ff17,Mr. Tankie? Are you genuinely ignorant or does strawmanning just come naturally to you? Do you even know what tendency I belong to? Because Im sure as shit far from Stalinism. Im not sure where you derive your hostility or your ignorance from. Perhaps you mistaken me for another user or perhaps youre stupid enough to think all who do not utilize some pettybourgeois criticism of the Bolshevik Revolution like you do are automatically Tankies. Nevertheless I will address your commentgtSocialism in the Marxian and also anarchist sense is a moneyless classless democratic society otherwise known as communism in which workers would seize control of the means of production and control it through worker councils.ltNo shit. Look at you you can define socialism correctly. Want a medal? gtIn Russia they were known as sovietsltNot necessarily. Soviets were not the same as workers councils or factory committees. There is some confusion because both are organic democratic organizations by the workers but they are not the same thing. gtLenin after seizing control of Russia during a coup or a revolution if youre a tankie in  from the provisional government.ltLenin didnt seize power the Bolshevik power threw out the provisional government did away with the Constituent Assembly and vested supreme power into the Congress of Soviets. Theres a reason why they took power SPECIFICALLY when they gained a MAJORITY in the Soviets.gtHe quickly realized that socialism could not take place in Russia because of its small industrial base and economic backwardness.ltNot true. The Bolsheviks consciously knew the position Russia was in it wasnt that they took power and quickly realized their dreams went to the devil. Their revolution was ENTIRELY contingent on a broader European or at least a German one. All of them knew socialism couldnt exist in one country hence why Lenin SPECIFICALLY outlined that their use of the term socialist in USSR only referred to their transition TO socialism see Tax in Kind.gtA decentralized state and a powerful industrial state were irreconcilable and he began to crush the workers councils in an attempt to centralize all economic and political power to the communist government. Destroying workers councils  defeats the whole purpose of socialism as they are supposed to have the power not state.ltA decentralized state was never on the agenda you fool nor is it the program of communists. The proletarian dictatorship has no decentralized element you can read Engels expositions on the superior nature of unitary states as opposed to federated ones if you wish a more original backing of this concept. Lenin knew this full and well and as does all genuine communists. We support the centralization of power into the hands of the proletariat specifically the PARTY of the proletariat. The purpose of socialism isnt to give power to da worker councils and not da state its to establish a society based on freely associated labor where the free development of each becomes the condition for the free development of all. There is nothing decentralist about the labor state. Will the proletarian dictatorship naturally be expressed through workers councils? Perhaps. We do not know. This was the political expression of the proletarian revolution in  and also in the Hungarian one later on against Stalinism. We can say confidently we do not know if workers councils are going to be the organs of state power in any future proletarian dictatorship. The point of these things is that they are organic as in  etc. and not imposed out of principle as you seem to posit!. As for the Bolsheviks doing away with nonBolshevik Soviets of course they did and nobody contests this. I will quote another user on this issue because he explains it well enoughgtThere is no snappy and concise response to explain why the Bolsheviks suppressed the Soviets where they did not have a majority. But mainly it is this They had overthrown capitalism in Russia and were fighting to spread world revolution. The Mensheviks and Right SRs would have returned power to the bourgeoisie and left Russia in control of foreign capital or perhaps even a restored monarchy. These were extreme measures in extreme circumstances. The idea that the Bolsheviks would have said okay you got a couple of more votes than we did so go ahead and liquidate the revolution doesnt really make sense. Their biggest commitment was to world revolution not to local soviet democracy which IS NOT EXPLICITLY SOCIALIST ON ITS OWN. Lenin was no hypocrite. And there is a great deal of literature on this stuff. I recommend E.H. Carrs works on the Russian Revolution for a nonparticipants view. None of the Bolsheviks ever stated anywhere that is known a desire for a oneparty state. And frankly they may have made some errors in clamping down on factions  but they were under siege literally.ltI highly suggest Trotskys Terrorism and Communism for further reading.As for now I will leave you with this quote by Plekhanov who ended up a renegade The success of the revolution is the highest law. And if the success of the revolution demands a temporary limitation on the working of this or that democratic principle then it would be criminal to refrain from such a limitation...The revolutionary proletariat might limit the political rights of the higher classes ...If in a burst of revolutionary enthusiasm the people chose a very fine parliament ...then we would make of it a long parliament and if the elections turned out unsuccessfully then we would have to try to disperse it. ,socialism,cy83bvc,2,t5_2qjii

Do you? gt antisocial personality disorder doesnt existthey do but guess what most people with personality disorders dont go on shooting sprees and those who do usually have more motivation behind it besides antisocial personality disorders.gt claiming that all mentally ill people have the same problems. to say that mentally ill people share a common experience of oppression isnt to say that they all have the same problems they dont all have the same problems.My point as it has been from the beginning is that mental illness is almost NEVER the sole cause or the primary cause of mass shootings less than  of mass shooters even had mental illnesses and those who did almost always had reactionary motivation. Buying into the liberal myth that mentally ill people are dangerous with guns and mentally ill people are the main perpetrators of mass shootings is nothing but ableist and does nothing but further the material and ideological oppression and stigma against mentally disabled people.,socialism,cyqz11d,4,t5_2qjii

Also organic farming relies heavily on animal manure for fertility and this manure comes from confined animals. If you dont want to eat meat that is fine but you also need to be aware that animals are harmed due to plant based agriculture as well.

To avoid boring you to death and butchering theory Id recommend some of the links in my original comment What is Property? The Conquest of Bread and Mutual Aid are the long form versions that would without a doubt answer every possible question you could imagine regarding these issues..The intro videos I linked to are also a good starting point as they cover and lay out both Marxist and anarchist perspectives. I cant recommend Chomsky and Richard Wolff enough as they are very succinct speakers.To avoid repeating myselfgtId rather just keep the factory personalYou can do that. Its only personal property when you are the only one using it to produce.gtSounds like private policing.Except its the exact opposite.gtSo is spending time with my kids which would become priority number one since I have no need to produce things for others and since my needs are taken care of. I would just spend time with my family.In a communist society you could do that automation. In a socialist society the work week would be drastically shorter.Both are wins if that is your goal.gt Life is coercive. If you dont work the land or hunt you die. Unless others are providing for your needs. I dont work in a factory atm because Im coerced but because I prefer it over hunting and gatheringWithout a capitalist state or private equivalent enforcing dispossession people would have access to the necessary productive means of life that already exist. Production would be for their benefit the workers not the benefit of the owner of the toolsmachineryworkplace profit.gt my self built factoryNo. Relate this back to what I said about computers.sidenote Im also  positive there has never been a selfbuilt factorygtOr is all of this not possible till we have full automation of production.There seems to be a confusion here so to clear it up Socialism is a political ideology and movement which has proposed a set of social and economic measures policies and systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production.  WikipediaIn political and social sciences communism is a social political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes money and the state.  WikipediaCommunism is the highest developed stage of socialism wherein there is no state no money no class system. High levels of automation ensure the means of production provide for all.

6730368,0,t1_d0fe0kk,gtMany Disney stories tacitly endorse monarchal rule. Snow White and Cinderella for example both feature protagonists who are surreptitiously deposed members of the royal family and things can only be set right when they reclaim their rightful place among the aristocracy.Uhhh..what? Snow White has a freaking Evil Queen who is trying to murder someone who she even thinks poses a threat to her power because she has a goddamn magic mirror. If anything that seems to strongly indicate that the aristocracy has way too much unchecked power. I mean they literally wrote her as evil. I say they because The Grimm Brothers wrote the original story. Its actually pretty tame for them but they still gruesomely kill the queen at the end by making her dance in shoes they put in burning coals until she falls down from exhaustion and dies from the coals.Cinderellas origins also old and arguably just cynical. She just gets her dress ripped up by her stepsisters who then go on to marry lords. Disney only made it more childish and whimsical in the good people get rewarded kind of way.gtIn Sleeping Beauty the kingdom is threatened because King Stefans only daughter cannot marry thus giving him a male heir until Maleficents curse is broken.Disney didnt really write Sleeping Beauty either. Like many of their stories in that era they were based off of old fairy tales. Btw heres the source material they worked with. In case you dont read it there were already royalty in that story and all Disney did is alter it so it could be presented with a G rating instead of a hard R rating.gtEven in Robin Hood a story about a folk hero theif fighting oppression peace cannot truly be restored until Prince John is deposed by the good King Richard whose claim to the throne is more legitimate because he is the older brother.Okay but again a product of its time. Plus Robin Hood is the protagonist of the movie and hes basically a revolutionary anarchist trying to redistribute the wealth that those in power wrongfully took. Plus in the original story he hates clerics organized religion and the sheriff of Nottingham the government police.gtOne could say that these stories come from a time when monarchy was the only game around and thats true. It is also true however that Disney chose to retell these stories with that tacit endorsement of monarchy still in tact.Aaaaand here is where you completely give up reason to try and misrepresent Disney who again I think is far from a perfect company and has more or less tacitly endorsed racism before. Disney just toned down the violence and cynicism in these stories so they could work with a modern child audience. Unless youre arguing that any work that is set in that time period is by presenting the world as it was endorsing that we should go back to it. Thats would be insane. Game of Thrones if anything makes the most compelling argument against monarchy Ive ever seen.Edit I guess evidence is not needed or wanted on this sub. Fucking morons.,socialism,d0fh98o,-4,t5_2qjii

Socialism is really broad and by definition asking if socialism works or whatever is bonkers. Socialism is not a system its a negative a reaction an opposition.Now there are socialists systems deriving from the critique of capitalism actually a lot of them. But they are not socialism itself they are whatever socialist system. There is no unity between Blanqui Proudhon St Simon Marx Bakunin to stay in the th century etc. beside opposition to capitalism. Heck I dont think that I would rather live in the system that  of this sub wants leninists maos stals ... I dont fancy being dead than in today France which is pretty shitty. And Im clearly a socialist and they are too since they oppose capitalism.So I dont really see the point of fighting for the socialist identity defending socialism etc ... Youre against capitalism ? Great youre a socialist. Now lets see on what we can actually work together. If we cant I dont really care that you are a socialist. For example I knocked a few teeth out of people from the LTF french part of ICL FI when they came defending Daech near a Kurdish rally and they are socialist.

And it actually caters to bourgeois morality.I certainly think there are people who would like the idea of fulfilling someones sexual needs without the intent of profit I have felt that way many times myself. Again my example of women who share their pictures on gonewild for free.

6762625,0,t1_d0isjb1,gtA state in an economy with private ownership is necessarily owned or at least inordinately influenced by the capitalists and so anything it owns is not socialist but capitalist in nature and exists to support the ruling order.That doesnt jive. The its not socialism so it must be capitalism is the problem here. The two ideologies are fundamentally incompatible specifically with regards to ownership.Basic Capitalist ideology is private ownership with political structures to support that. Many ideologies that are BASED on capitalism take private ownership of most things any profit driven industry that doesnt push social inequality too far for the populace to accept and include publicstate ownership of the rest. That model is not capitalism neither is it socialism. Its a hybrid model of capitalism such as state or welfare capitalism or one of the many other models. My entire argument is not defending capitalism or attacking socialism. Its that calling something capitalism because it meets  of capitalist ideologies but claiming anything that isnt  socialism isnt socialism is a contradictory logic.In no way do I think capitalism is better it isnt or that the hybrid models of capitalism weve implemented are better I dont think they are.,socialism,d0itlj8,2,t5_2qjii

6809272,0,t1_d0o45zv,Look please reread what I have written. The discussion about two class parties has little relevance in a country where  are farmers  are selfemployed and in reality some of those self employed are workers who are classified as selfemployed to evade the various labour laws. Yes there are managerial layers and certain intermediate strata but this is very different from the discussion around Pepper. In a country with a population like this the agitational use of the slogan of a party of the  an anticapitalist party and a party of working people. SAlt is not advocating a two class party. I am not advocating a two class party. No substantial force in the US today is advocating anything of the sort.,socialism,d0o4ls6,1,t5_2qjii
6809868,0,t1_d0o4sce,So what are the two classes you think people are trying to build a party around? The unemployed are not a class for a start. They are part of the proletariat. The proletariat and the bourgeois are the overwhelming majority of the population of the US today. The movement around Sanders has a completely different class base to the populist movement. As I said the Trotsky quote was not really relevant other than the general and undeniable fact that Marxists are opposed to collaboration between the bourgeois and the proletariat. There are no workers parties in the US today. There are smaller and larger propaganda groups. In the absence of a working class party the movement around Sanders has got an echo from sections of workers. The people who support Sanders are predominantly working class. His program is predominantly composed of reformist working class demands. I support those demands as far as they go. I dont support his illusions in reforming the democratic party. This party is not a multiclass FarmerLabour party even in the sense that the Stalinised Comintern used it but a party of the bourgeois. You are correct that some of Sanders demands for example his call for the breakup of the banks are pettybourgeois demands that offer no way forward. As a socialist I advocate socialisation of the banks major industries under workers control and management. So what you have is a radicalisation of sections of workers around a figure with a background in the socialist movement and a program very similar to that of reformist workers parties. That is strictly speaking a petit bourgeois program.What SAlt are doing is trying to steer this movement of workers in the direction of independent working class politics fighting for an openly socialist program. That has very little in common with a proposal to liquidate the early Communist Party into a movement composed mainly of farmers.,socialism,d0o71ly,1,t5_2qjii

He writes with great emotion about the thousands of tramautized soldiers many of who lose their minds and are penned like animals until they die and he notes that in his time returning veterans are three times more likely to die prematurely than those who stayed home.BlumUS distribution of wealthThe Centre for Investigative JournalismSome history on US imperialism by us corporations.The real newsManufacturing consent,socialism,d0y3rom,4,t5_2qjii

6909203,0,t1_d0zghqi,I think we share quite a few similar positions to the anarchists with regards to the Bolsheviks but I think that most left communists typically favour the Bolsheviks from earlier on and some of the more authoritarian left communists support them as far as . I myself am particularly libertarian in my alignment so I dont want you to think my views are representative of the whole of left communism.Orthodox Marxism was also a part of the Second International and largely influenced it before its split though certainly social democrats and such were all a part of it too and revised even further from it. We would also say that systematisation leads to dogmatic practices and understandings of society  which I see to be linked to the theory of scientific revolutions as laid out by Kuhn.Marx differed between the lower and higher stages of communist society with the difference between them being stability and resources whether or not rationing and control of resources would be needed especially during the emergence of communism when the last burdens of capitalism were being undone. Yet both are still communistic societies and thus are free of a state whereas it has been revised to be understood that the lower stage of communism known now as socialism is said to be characterised by its presence of a state.On the state it is in one of Marx or Engels works in which they make it clear that the dictatorship of the proletariat is not to be understood as a state and that the word doesnt truly explain the concept using instead a German word which I think translates roughly to mean commune. We also emphasise that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the transformative process that society undertakes with all organs of working class power encompassing this whether they be councils unions municipalities or whatever form they might take.,socialism,d0zh82q,4,t5_2qjii

Anarchists criticized communism for its advocacy of the working class seizing the State. Marxists believe that any apparatus or social model that replaces the functions of the bourgeois state in terms of protecting and redistributing property is the dictatorship of the proletariat. So to an anarchist DotP means either the U.S.S.R. becoming corrupt or SYRIZA becoming impotent and selfserving. To a communist DotP can equally refer to Lenins Russia as well as Catalonias CNTFAI.

7122356,0,t3_4d1l76,No. However unlike the idealist and typically Maoist perception of Socialism it had nothing to do with the ideals of the leadership suddenly shifting away from Socialism and then the DPRK being left with bad socialist leaders. The DPRKs leadership was never interested in Socialism and anyone who isnt persuaded by someone simply waving a red flag and proclaiming their desire for Socialism could easily see that. What changed for the DPRK was the collapse of the Soviet Union. This effected pretty much all the Soviet Bloc  including for example Cuba. It had nothing to do with some change in leadership just a shift in economic circumstances.The DPRK was always a totalitarian nationalist dictatorship with no interest in Socialism. But it wasnt always in such a sorry state. The destruction of its biggest trade partner created a bad situation for it just as it would for anyone. In any case people massively overstate its economic successes over the ROK. South Korea is one of the most rapidly developing economies on the planet and has been for decades and it did that on the basis of Capitalism and the markets. Indeed its only real competitors in the area of economic developmentThat is the impressive scale of it were the Soviet Union in its first few decades Japan and China.,socialism,d1nq7tj,14,t5_2qjii

I have a few questions.gtAnarchists believe that when anyone worker or bourgeois gains political power they will work to strengthen and extend their power. In the revolutionary vanguard tradition we criticize it because we believe that the vanguard will become the new bourgeoisie and will distribute property in ways that either favors them personally or strengthens their power.Why do you think that a vanguard inevitably would lead to bureaucracy? Why would all of the members of a vanguard suddenly become counterrevolutionaries simply because theyre in power? It seems like that simply means the wrong people were in the vanguard since then they werent dedicated to the revolution.gtIf you disagree with a law you dont have to follow it.What would be the point of a law if you can just break it with no penalty?

I dont vehemently oppose markets but when it comes to the bigger necessary things like food and other necessities it does a terrible job. Markets abstract the time and necessary labor that it takes to produce a commodity. You can find youtube videos to introduce you to the subject matter. Check out kapitalism . Innovation can occur without markets yes. Innovation is not necessarily beneficial. There really isnt a need for what many consider innovations under capitalism.

The right is much more pragmatic in this regard and is concerned about results. To some people on the left if you dont resist just the way they envision somehow youre wrong to resist at all. Some acts even if they arent revolutionary are shunned because now is not the time when in fact any time is really the time.  The problem is this what is action to you? I think to many people once you ask them what their idea of political action is it really shows how far people are willing to go in their aims to change society.

Clown is my current favorite. Even kids can agree.Edit Comrades Im not a fascist sympathizer. Please let Orwell help me explain emphasis addedgtFascism is also a political and economic system. Why then cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one  not yet anyway. To say why would take too long but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves nor the Conservatives nor Socialists of any colour are willing to make.

Look at what classicalconservative proponents of civilization say about it.  There are good attributes that we should steal.  Im an Anarchist who subscribes to the idea that Anarchism is an ideological magpie.  Additionally repurposing a term takes it away from its previous owner pulling the rug out from under their feet.Also I dispute the notion of materially social equals.  Some people are going to have more or better things than others and thats not inherently a problem.  The only way to have perfect material equality is for everything to be the same everywhere which is obviously absurd regardless Im talking about social equality which means that nobody is considered better or worse or more or less socially respectable just because they have more or less wealth or a different skin color or language or customs or a different job or job equivalent.gtThe only mutual aid each citizen gives to others is what is necessary to continue the relation.Can you clarify?

7404787,0,t3_4gossn,gtWhat are differences between a Communist dictator and a Fascist FurherDuce? Im not really understanding how for example Kim Jong Un is anything but a total Fascist ruler.  Does Communism support Nationalism? Fascism is a right wing ultranationalist authoritarian politcal ideology that advocates a corporatist economic system and promises a national rejuvenation. Communists on the other hand support the creation of a stateless classless moneyless society where the things we use to produce goods are shared by all. The DPRK is not communist. gtDoes Communism support Nationalism?I think this depends on what you mean by nationalism and who youre talking to. I think this Bookchin quote sums up my views on the subject pretty well.Cultural freedom and variety let me emphasize should not be confused with nationalism. That specific peoples should be free to fully develop their own cultural capacities is not merely a right but a desideratum. The world will be a drab place indeed if a magnificent mosaic of different cultures do not replace the largely deculturated and homogenized world created by modern capitalism. But by the same token the world will be completely divided and peoples will be chronically at odds with one another if their cultural differences are parochialized and if seeming cultural differences are rooted in biologistic notions of gender racial and physical superiority. Historically there is a sense in which the national consolidation of peoples along territorial lines did produce a social sphere that was broader than the narrow kinship basis for kinship societies because it obviously is more open to strangers just as cities tend to foster broader human affinities than tribes. But neither tribal affinities nor territorial boundaries constitute a realization of humanitys potentiality to achieve a full sense of commonality with rich but harmonious cultural variations. Frontiers have no place on the map of the planet any more than they have a place on the landscape of the mind.gtI have tried to find some information on the topic however I only find Zionist Conspiracy videos and the like.Yeah stay away from that shit.

And as I tried to illustrate Those sections who separate themselves in order to fight on those terms invariably betray the very people they were supposed to represent.There will always be coalitions independent bodies advisors think tanks economists and any number of intelligentsia whose job is to attack the conditions of the worker and wage class war from the top down. No worker inspired think tank will change that let alone be an effective weapon against it.What is an effective weapon is industrial action  the strike the picket line the stopwork  and grassroots action  organisation mass demonstration.

7599920,0,t3_4jd9y6,I think its easier to read and explain Chapter  starting with Section  The Fetishism of the Commodity and the Secret Thereof first. Alot of people get tripped up with different forms of Value and how they relate to each other and Marx does a bad job at making that clear in chapter  read in order it appears as if Marx continually contradicts himself especially if you have zero grounding in Classical Economics. Section  is when the chapter really comes together and you get the clearest explanation of Commodities Use amp Exchange Value etc. without reading the entirety of Capital.I read a letter written by Engels that for the life of me I cant find again that was written after Marxs death that made it clear that Marx was aware of the difficulty of Vol. which he put down to terrible editing and which he wanted to go back and correct a project that he never had time for.Anyway with the previous in mind me and some comrades have been chucking around some ideas to make a Wikipedialike version of Capital which hyperlinks core concepts to better descriptions appendix notes etc. from Marxs texts which will hopefully make self study easier without introducing secondary biases from people like David Harvey.    ,socialism,d362mo2,2,t5_2qjii

7837061,0,t3_4mltan,gt Secondly the KPD wrongly identified its enemy. Its members were told to focus their efforts on untiring daily exposure of the shameless treacherous role of the SPD...gt gt The Communists certainly had many legitimate criticisms of the reformist Socialist Party leadership. During the revolution that began in  the SPD sided with capitalism and encouraged its violent suppression by the Freikorps rightwing militias. The long term consequences of this were tragic. The fledgling Soviet democracy established by workers in Russia was isolated in a backward country dominated by peasants. Deprived of international support Russias Bolsheviks eventually succumbed to Stalinist counterrevolution.gt gt The SPD leadership had connived in the murder of the first leaders of German Communism Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in . During the rise of Hitler the SPD used language not dissimilar to that thrown against it by the KPD A bosses alliance has arisen  Nazis and Communists. Whoever votes for the Communists... serves the interests of the employers and helps reaction. In other words the SPD was a thoroughly reformist party with all the limitations and problems that that entailed for the achievement of socialism.gt gt But a balanced judgement of the situation required something more than a critique of fellow left wingers. What was needed was sober analysis.gt gt Trotsky and his German supporters pleaded in vain with the Communists to concentrate their efforts on the key issues of the moment above all the threat of Nazism Denying this threat belittling it failing to take it seriously is the greatest crime that can be committed today. Instead of the ridiculous accusation that the foremost enemy was social fascism he called on the Communists to say the following to the Socialists The policies of our parties are irreconcilably opposed but if the fascists come tonight to your organisations hall we will come running arms in hand to help you. Will you promise us that if our organisation is threatened you will rush to our aid?gt gt Alas this united front was rejected by the Communists. The Trotskyists could do nothing. They were too small an organisation to have any impact on either of the main workers parties.gt gt There has been some debate about why Germanys Communists became so obsessed with castigating other parts of the left. The key responsibility for this certainly lay with Stalin who having established a state capitalist dictatorship in Russia was using the foreign communist movement as a tool of his foreign policy. He had been engaged in a faction fight with opponents such as Trotsky and Bukharin and wanted to promote a line which sounded radical irrespective of the damage this would do on an international level.gt gt The hypocrisy involved was shown a few years later when Stalin reversed his position entirely. He then argued for a popular front alliance against fascism which not only encompassed other working class parties but openly right wing capitalist forces.gt gt Numerous Communists see the social fascist ie SPD influenced factory committees and trade union officers as comrades who are fighting for the same goal  socialism... Numerous Communists do not see the social fascist functionaries and in particular the honourable reformists as the main enemy.gt gt However the lesson of the Third Period disaster goes beyond the need for a united front against fascism. That menace was just one component of a larger picture. The call for a united front did not mean that everything else should be forgotten. That is why Trotsky did not suggest that the Communists gloss over the fact that SPD and KPD policies were irreconcilably opposed. The key problem was that the KPD had lost its sense of perspective and priority its sense of what was important at any given moment. Focusing its work on attacking another part of the left it was ignoring the economic crisis political turmoil capitalist offensives as well as Nazi manoeuvring.gtgtSo it is important that revolutionary socialists always make a careful assessment of the overall situation shape their political actions around that and while building a revolutionary party  the essential component for change  work with others in united fronts.,socialism,d3wybmh,-1,t5_2qjii

It is perfectly correct to state that the man who was punched by a racist Trump supporter while being escorted out of the stadium was in point of fact being escorted out. As for the actions of Trumpss supporter you pointed out assuming no prior phyisical provocation and I have no evidence that there was any then I have no reason to believe that they were justified. Signs are private property. A persons body is private property. Both of those things cannot be attacked.

I dont. gtWhat do you gain coming to rSocialism defending a Fascist like Trump is and victimizing the White Supremacists that go in his rally and clearly initiated the aggression against minorities and oppressed groups ?I dont defend fascist like Trump first because I do not believe Trump to be a fascist but second because what I defend is the physical integrity of individuals.As to what I gain from coming here  a different perspective.   gtYeah this must tell us something. The fact that youre outraged by his notions on trade or his speech patterns and not by the fact that he wants to censor the press segregate Mexican people ID Muslims violently kick all Illegal Immigrants legitimize Police Violence on Black People out and reinstate the Red Scare.Youre not outraged by the fact that he thinks hes the chosen one that hes authoritarian that he appreciates Mussolinis ideas that he believes in things like White Genocide...Youre not outraged that his supporters are creating a paramilitary group to defend him. Youre not outraged by the fact that they believe in jingoistic Nationalism and Christian fundamentalism.I hope you and all the people that want to make excessive and empty subjectivism on Donald Trump are quite happy when this guy is elected and he initiates another Middle East war when his Mexico Wall is complete and when he starts to make temporary concentration camps to deport the millions of people he thinks are undesirable in the United States.Theres a string of accusation here some of which are true some of which arent as far as I can tell. In any event I dont endorse a large part of what was said there. But yes I do care about trade and the cognitive ability of whoever is gonna become president. I suppose I must be sorry for not caring about the things you care about. Perhaps you can be sorry for not caring about the things I care about. gtTo portray Mr. Trump and his supporters like the ones that are being attackedThey were attacked. This is an undisputed fact. That antiTrump supporters were attacked is also an undisputed fact. What I also said is that the disruption of rallies mostly went one way. You then tell me that Trump supporter attacked the antiTrump people first while they were being at Trumps rally and that this justifies everything that happened subsequently. Thats a view. I dont agree with it but its a view. I believe it justifies self defense on the spot of the attack and the pressing of charges against the perpetrator not retaliation against other people at some other event. I know these people dont want a dialogue. Its fairly clear what they want   deport illegals  bar muslims from entry  sealed border  trade wars. ,socialism,d3xdmmq,-3,t5_2qjii

I dont believe that the Russian Revolution lead to the Holocaust or that the Holocaust necessitated the Cuban Revolution etc. Rather the point is that they were both violent means to bring about an end one of which we agree with the other we adamantly oppose. If we want to live in a world where a communist or socialist violent uprising can take place we must accept that a fascist violent uprising can also take place. Violence seems to be in our human nature so both are possible. I think then the issues with we have no way of knowing if were wrong stem from definitions. That is were not exactly debating the same thing. I using know in a much preciser way in this discussion than I would colloquially daytoday. For example I know   . There is no question. I do not know that x  . I may believe that x  . I may even have very good reasons to believe so but that can only make my belief stronger but that does not mean I know. I could have very well overlooked something that could have minutely or radically changed my beliefs. We cant know anything in this way. Our senses are fallible nor do we ever have the whole picture. This doesnt mean I dont believe things. I believe many things wholeheartedly. But I could have missed something and I could be wrong. If we were to silence the fascists who we believe are wholly wrong we have very good evidence to counter their points where do we decide is the magic line between rightness and wrongness? Furthermore our ideology is not perfect. There are things we certainly overlook things we dont even consider. Silencing the dialog would mean that we may never confront those topics as a society. Even if the other side is wrong about those topics because they brought it to the discussion they have provided some amount of use to society. Talk is cheap. Until they do anything its just talk. We cannot stop someone based on future actions that have not yet happened. And yes I could be a target of a Holocaust type event. I would very much fall into the political dissident category as we all would. Not to mention that any of us could very well be targeted by fascist violence at anytime. ,socialism,d4c0mom,1,t5_2qjii

I also did not talk about Tsipras at allgtIts the EU that cut the funding to rescue operations in the Mediterrenean to a fraction of what it was.Its the governments that are cutting funding to something that can only be achieved by pooling resources.

He is taught to respect law enforcement and that they help keep him his family and his community safe. He is told his entire life that police are the good guys.The boy grows up. Because of his circumstances he doesnt have many options in life. But one option shines out above the rest become a police officer. After all he wants to help his community. He wants to keep people safe. He wants to be a good guy.Sometimes hell have a job that involves arresting some guy who was smoking weed. Sometimes he stops a wouldby child rapist. Sometimes hes handing out tickets to people driving  mph over the limit. Sometimes he saves a woman from an abusive relationship.He doesnt think about those times when maybe he isnt the good guy. Because why would he? After all police are the good guys thats what he had been told all his life.My point in bringing this up is to highlight that very rarely is it the individual officers who are going out of their way to oppress people. They are victims of state indoctrination and they truly believe that they are a force for good in this world. Rather than killing cops our time would be much better spent addressing why they become cops in the first place.,socialism,d54v0q7,24,t5_2qjii

The more oppressive the force the more powerful you have to be to keep control. I dont believe there is ever a point where the balance of oppression and power becomes insurmountable and history has shown groups of extremely oppressed people rising up to prove that. If that point does exist it is certainly not within the DPRK. Outside of the context of this one particular state this is not a particularly controversial thought among socialists. What makes the DPRK different then? To suggest that something is different is to imply that the people there are either less strong or less intelligent than the people of other countries. This is backed up by the statement that they need foreign intervention the people of other countries are able to stand up to their government but not them. The implication that we here halfway across the world are able to tell exactly how oppressed they really are when they who actually live through it can not.

I think its perfectly fine to advocate a strategy where you vote for Clinton if you live in a swing state and vote for Green Party or PSL or whatever if you live in a nonswing state i.e. Ill vote for Jill Stein since I live in California based on the strategic decision to vote against a possible Trump presidency and the capture of Americas sprawling security apparatus by a protofascist movement.  There is no moral dimension to voting for a candidate because the presidential race is structurally designed to be a contest between two bourgeoisie parties that is isolated to a few swing states.  You dont have to feel guilty or icky or whatever for voting for the lesser evil if youre in a place where the votes actually affect the outcome as long as your political activity is not simply to vote every four years.  Real politics takes place outside the ballot box.  If the only thing you do is vote then a vote for Stein is just as useless as a vote for Clinton. What matters is socialist organizing in the workplace in the streets in the schools etc.  If you are actually involved in this level of substantive politics a vote for Clinton doesnt mean you support Clintonit can simply mean you oppose Trump more.                ,socialism,d5td4iz,3,t5_2qjii

His first point that for a society to function as a commune there must be a state exterior to the commune that must organize it is completely fallacious people can organize themselves. Communities can organize themselves and do so through popular institutions that arent separate from the community. He doubts local democracy as a possibility because he doesnt want to have to attend meetings about the organization of the community in other words he has no interest in independent living. Independence implies responsibility  if Im independent then the only person responsibly for my life is myself and I have to organize and maintain it. He doesnt want this. He just wants something that delivers and functions. He is a consumer concerned with consumption. Not only is he advocating for states hes wants a transnational state because apparently the only solution to the problems created by nationstates are to create even bigger more centralized states. Once again Im left completely uninterested in anything Zizek has to say or offer.

8466488,0,t1_d5zgk6j,gtuncle tomantifeminist it upYoure not saying I have to be an Uncle Tom to disregard race issues are you? Because if you are Ive got some news for you There is no way to solve race issues within capitalism seeing that any more change would require uprooting the class structure thats been established. I support educating people about race and fighting against racism but being black is not a part of my revolutionary identity. Why cant I say this without being an Uncle Tom? This to me is the reality. In my experience race is nothing more than a distraction part of the greater issue of bourgeois nationalism. To bring race into our movement would be setting a precedent for black socialism and white socialism which is kind of the opposite of what we want. I even have to wonder what youre talking about when you say that race issues arent just a distraction. Do you want socialists to do so solve racism within capitalism? OR are you saying that antiracism is part of our movement? The former is impossible the latter is naturally true.Ultimately this is my takeaway Race issues will be solved when people no longer have a reason to hate.

It made me think about why social spending doesnt work in my country as opposed to this country. I understood it boiled down to corruption. Which led me to realize the whole capitalism vs  communism was just a facade. When I had that much of an awareness I was gravitated to learn more about it. I witnessed a lot of bribery first hand. I had a teacher pass me the answers to a state competition I was afraid of getting caught so I crumpled the paper kept it under my food until it was over. Later Made me angry after I got cheated out of a competition I realized everyone else was doing this shit too and competition as an economic system was just Bullshit ie look insider trading I got way more but I gotta participate in the capitalist system  brb,socialism,d65tki7,2,t5_2qjii

8549770,0,t1_d6a9sul,Im not afraid to say the Soviet Union wasnt socialist. I do not consider it defeatist to say that socialism can only come about after the successful abolition of class society. I consider it defeatist to say otherwise. If we start saying that societies that havent abolished class society or capitalism are socialist then we lose sight of what socialism actually is. Socialism just becomes a meaningless term for something we agree with and before you know it you have US politicians arguing for welfare capitalism and calling it socialism. You can call socialism whatever you want just dont be surprised when people question the validity of such claims. If a society still has classes capitalism private property alienation wage labour the law of value and generalised commodity production what difference does it make if you drape it in red flags and call it socialism? It just obscures the reality of the situation and makes us think weve achieved our goal when in fact were a far way from home.A revolution never means seizing power a revolution is by definition a forcible overthrow of the existing social order in favour of a new one. If you seize power without overthrowing the existing social order then you havent had a revolution youve just changed the people at the top.

8620121,0,t3_4xqbpe,These are my two most favorite quotes in the world about the hypocrisy and evilness of liberalism. Both from Malcolm X. These are both perfect for not only racial relations but the class struggle as well.Malcolm XThe white liberal is the worst enemy to America and the worst enemy to the black man. Let me explain what I mean by the white liberal. In America there is no such thing as Democrat or Republican anymore. In America you have liberals and conservatives.The only people living in the past who think in terms of Im a Democrat or Republican is the American Negro. Hes the one that runs around bragging about party affiliation. Hes the one that sticks to the Democrat or sticks to the Republican.But white people are divided into two groups liberals and conservative. The Democrats who are conservative vote with the Republicans who are conservative. The Democrats who are liberal vote with the Republicans that are liberal.The white liberal arent white people who are for independence who are moral and ethical in their thinking. They are just a faction of white people that are jockeying for power. The same as the white conservative is a faction of white people that are jockeying for power.They are fighting each other for power and prestige and the one that is the football in the game is the Negro  million black people. A political football a political pawn an economic football and economic pawn. A social football a social pawn.The liberal elements of whites are those who have perfected the art of selling themselves to the Negro as a friend of the Negro. Getting sympathy of the Negro getting the allegiance of the Negro and getting the mind of the Negro. Then the Negro sides with the white liberal and the white liberal use the Negro against the white conservative.So that anything that the Negro does is never for his own good never for his own advancement never for his own progress hes only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal.The worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros and calling himself a liberal and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have.If the Negro wasnt taken tricked or deceived by the white liberal then Negros would get together and solve our own problems.I only cite these things to show you that in America the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white man. The only way that our problem will be solved is when the black man wakes up clean himself up stand on his own feet and stop begging the white man and take immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white man to do for us. Once we do for self then we will be able to solve our own problemsThe white conservatives arent friends of the Negro either but they at least dont try to hide it. They are like wolves they show their teeth in a snarl that keeps the Negro always aware of where he stands with them. But the white liberals are foxes who also show their teeth to the Negro but pretend that they are smiling. The white liberals are more dangerous than the conservatives they lure the Negro and as the Negro runs from the growling wolf he flees into the open jaws of the smiling fox. One is the wolf the other is a fox. No matter what theyll both eat you.,socialism,d6j4669,1,t5_2qjii

We have enough of that under neoliberal capitalisms secondorder mechanics. This just swaps one surveillance state for another.One of the things I think about is the ability to plan a basic economy and by basic I mean get people food and shelter at least. To predict this you watch peoples spending habits and data in Capitalism how much food the average person consumes blah blah and you build a model of production from that so say that the average person eats  loaves of bread a year you make  for each person etc etc you then still have computers watch and model peoples consumption habits and models of production adjust according to those maybe on a  month basis. I understand how impossible it is to model a Capitalist economy there are so many products in Capitalism it would be impossible how do you monitor if people want this toothbrush or this other toothbrush etc etc? But Im of the opinion that with the coming resource crunch and climate change that whatever system supercedes Capitalism will not have such a complex economy. I predict that a future economy will put sustainability over all else and for that you need economic planning and sadly but true a sustainable economy is not a diverse economy.A book has come out recently called Trekonomics and it argues that a future economy will be reputation based rather than commodity I tend to agree.

And while some people accuse her of pandering when she talks to any AfricanAmerican there is much evidence to the contrary. Clinton has repeatedly reached out to the black community.

Isnt talking to people and telling youre gonna do something for them pandering? If they get something in return then I guess not  but this writer wrote that theres much evidence. gt Kaepernick referenced her  comment super predators.

She was referencing gang culture but many interpreted the term as racially coded language. I agree and I despised the term.This guy is not a very good spinmeister...gt Nonetheless Clinton apologized for the words she used  years ago that didnt receive mainstream press until she was running for President. She apologized for not using a sneaky enough dog whistle not for using Ku Klux Klan rhetoric.gt Additionally AfricanAmericans have held the Clintons accountable for years. Its a myth that AfricanAmericans blindly supported the Clintons. In  AfricanAmerican turnout bottomed at only  the lowest it had been since President Jimmy Carter in .Wow.

In what way is the Catholic Church going through lean years exactly?

It never really finishes its criticism. The author fails to actually show the futility of religion and never links the conditions that led to St.Theresas status to the injustices of capitalism.

Check out this reply for an explanation of where they went wrong.       gtMarxs Law of Value isnt a theory about the relationship between people and objects it is a theory about economic relationship between people and other people. Marx understands economic value to be a phenomena that emerges when people exchange the product of their labor for other products of labor at regular exchange ratios and his concept of value as sociallynecessary labor time is a theoretical construct employed to make sense of capitalist production as a whole. The real prediction of his analysis is that labor is the only input that can produce more economic value in the aggregate because more economic value cannot be created in exchange alone not what price of commodities wouldought to be like or what will make consumers desire goods more.,socialism,d7dyke9,17,t5_2qjii

The politician chooses to serve certain segments of the ruling class at the expense of certain other segments of the ruling class and this is definitely undertaken significantly though not entirely at their own initiative. But as for what theyre able to accomplish this is still nothing other than a negotiation between the people and the ruling class.

Perhaps people will do one thing when they are young and another thing when they grow older. Those who are but indifferent workers may continue with their groups those who are efficient will lose patience at always working with beginners and will go ahead by themselves unless a very altruist disposition makes it a pleasure to them to act as teachers or advisers to younger people.

Thus a free and easy change from one variety of Communism to another thence to any variety of Individualism and so on would be the most obvious and elementary thing in a really free society and if any group of people tried to check this to make one system predominant they would be as bitterly fought as revolutionists fight the present system.Theres bound to be conflict this is unavoidable as people are different have different values opinions and desires.

9405581,0,t3_59finj,Why does this market socialist shit pop up every few days? Here is what I wrote some time ago in response to another Schweickart videoWow this is even more astounding than I expected. Schweikharts proposels in short order Make every company into a democratically controlled coop. Keep the market for commodities and regulate it. Have a flat tax on the profits of all coops instead of the financial market allocate the capital he calls it that even! to regions according to the size of the population. Have the money loaned out ! from public banks to communities who want to start new businesses. This takes care of capitalism everything will be great from there...WTF?This so called socialism doesnt get rid of wage labor the commodity form money the state competition or even markets! How in hell does Schweickart expect this to not suffer from all the problems of capitalism?Coops will compete against each other on the market so that they can keep larger amounts of their pretax profits in order to have a higher standard of living and an even better chance to beat the competition in the next round of investing. Nice features of capitalism like joblesness due to automatizationrationalization will also go on because competition makes it inevitable. The coops can either choose vote to hang on to workers who arent needed anymore reducing their competitiveness or they can bow to the market pressures as every capitalist would and get rid of the newest the least productive the female and the oldest workers so that the rest can keep on competing.The propertyless wage workers will also compete against each other for a place in the best coops. There will be a mass of coops that cant compete and will either dissolve setting people free to migrate to where the successful coops are or they will be upheld with the loans from the general tax made into not competing sinkholes that produce substandard commodities for their communities and others that were impoverished like themselves.In addition this socialism will reproduce the inequality between economic centers and poorrural regions because the population density that is used for the distribution of the taxed money is of course a result of population movements under capitalism meaning that those regions that have will soon have even more while poor and rural regions will continue to wither away.Schweickart may believe that he gets rid of capitalist social relations by democratizing businesses but property and wage labor persists meaning that instead of a capitalist class you will soon have a managerial classworker aristocracy from coops most succesful in exploiting themselves in producing surplus value. Those will begin to dominate the economy and the politics of the state taking over the tax distribution process and establishing a second fortress of domination over those who lost in competition.By definition market socialism doesnt get rid of the capitalist anarchy of production either meaning that the structural tendency to overproduction and overaccumulation will still be a feature as well as the tendency of profits to fall. This in turn will result in regular crisis of the system while at least one of the capitalist features that resolve such situations destruction of financialized capital isnt available anymore.TLDR Schweickart is either an opportunist in the worst sense imaginable Bernstein or he just never understood the marxian critique of political economy.,socialism,d988249,12,t5_2qjii

But it is not because of rape laws as much as it is racist judges and juries convicting people of color. Again in my experience this is not a problem unique to rape cases and its not a problem caused by rape laws. gtThose same laws also disempower women. Its saying that a female cant really be trusted to make her own decisions and that its the males responsibility to make sure shes making sensible decisions for herself.To be fair what laws are you talking about? What counts as consent is pretty fluid and situational and the idea that a legal system can fully capture it is fantasy. gtThat could really mess with trial by jurys though if they listen to the press that has prejudged the defendant.Duke lacrosse team got off.

And Jill Stein didnt do well when confronted with that.I am not saying it is reasonable to vote for Trump Clinton or Johnson simply because Jill Stein fears Wifi and nuclear power plants she is still far better than any of these alternatives and a push for rd parties is needed.I just came to realize that Jill herself provides no reason for me as a science major to favor her aside from foreign policies and progressive financial politics but the context of her alternatives.,socialism,d9e0pp9,3,t5_2qjii

9487797,0,t3_5aou3x,There are important lessons to be learned from either following how the media mostly large network media report on NoDAPL or by actively involving ourselves in solidarity with the the movement.For the majority of us I would recommend paying attention to how the state wields its sanctioning power against nonviolent protectors at the behest of private capital interests. The US has a long history of violent repression and subversion against labor movements and mass popular movements and we would do well to remember that while we can act as witnesses to the tactics utilized by the state from afar. The more of us that are willing to study the states reaction to this movement the better  especially for movements and organizing efforts in the future and as this movement persists in the coming months.Infiltration is a common tactic that the state often makes use of  the intent is to cause division within the movement and to give the sanctioning power of the state a justified reason to respond with greater force violence. Movements have to be ready to counteract this tactic  checkpoints sign ins and or vetting on the exterior parts of the front lines  whereby individuals are not allowed to participate until they have been deemed committed to nonviolent tactics. Self policing within movements and ongoing nonviolent education for participants is key to foil state tactics that seek to escalate and provoke violence from the movement.Chris Hedges has written about these and similar tactics used by the state during the OWS movement in NYC including infiltration and assaults denial of access for reportersmedia and including sexual assaults by policeI remember during my freshman year at University my parents would randomly bring up the Occupy Wall Street movements that were then spreading through the countries urban areas they were positing the tired Soros connections and lazy rich kids rhetoric that MSM was pushing  interesting my mother has since become much more sympathetic as she has realized that she too is part of the  and that deferring to the overwhelming majority of the scientific community she recognizes that climate change is being influenced by humans and that change is needed. I was far too entrenched in the haze that the first year of college often provides to really study and witness the movement and pay close attention to the states response to OWS. This time around I am witnessing studying and supporting from afar for the time being. I hope they are prepared for the full weight of state sanction power and resources that are coming their way. I assume more than anything they will likely need more people if they are too be successful. gt People with power understand exactly one thing violence.  Chomsky,socialism,d9iko6n,10,t5_2qjii

The point about issues like this is that they involve balancing of interests. There comes a point that even for most prochoice proponents the interests of the child outweigh the mothers right to bodily autonomy.  The debate is not actually about whether a fetus is a person thats a factor whose implications have to be balanced against other factors.Demonizing people for their honest and not unreasonable beliefs is not a good way to reach consensus.,socialism,da52vqt,50,t5_2qjii

Their failure says little about Socialism as a whole which is vast diverse and not a monolithic ideology and more about the MarxismLeninism of the Soviet Union and its allies.Lets also bear in mind that Capitalist Liberal Democracy didnt get off the ground very easily either. The French Revolution traded one despot for another for example. gtAnd when a socialist society fails socialist claim it really wasnt socialismNot once did I say a failed Socialist society wasnt Socialism. Most MarxistLeninist states devolved into what are called state capitalist societies but again thats more reflective of MarxismLeninism than it is of Socialism as a whole. However as a general rule if you encounter that argument think about whether the society in question has the workers owning the means of production. If they dont its not socialist.

Does it still exist today?Read this article From the article gt An analysis of the relationships between  transnational corporations has identified a relatively small group of companies mainly banks with disproportionate power over the global economy.gtThe work to be published in PLoS One revealed a core of  companies with interlocking ownerships see image. Each of the  had ties to two or more other companies and on average they were connected to . Whats more although they represented  per cent of global operating revenues the  appeared to collectively own through their shares the majority of the worlds large blue chip and manufacturing firms  the real economy  representing a further  per cent of global revenues.gtWhen the team further untangled the web of ownership it found much of it tracked back to a superentity of  even more tightly knit companies  all of their ownership was held by other members of the superentity  that controlled  per cent of the total wealth in the network. In effect less than  per cent of the companies were able to control  per cent of the entire network says Glattfelder. Most were financial institutions. The top  included Barclays Bank JPMorgan Chase amp Co and The Goldman Sachs Group.And as for the oligarchic aspect consider how thoroughly things such as fossil fuel interests have hijacked our government for their own good instead of the common good. Or for another related example look how companies profiteered off of the Iraq war and basically had BushCheney at their whims. This sort of thing happens all the time.

Judging from the way this has been written Im assuming youre still in high school or whatever equivalent. An easy way to structure essays at this level isTitleIntro Paragraph Start with a few sentences to give context to your argument. Follow this up with your hypothesisargument itself. This should take the form of because of x y occurs or something similar. You should then signpost a quick summary of what evidence your essay will use to prove your argumenthypothesis.Body Paragraphs These should begin with a quick intro sentence that explains what you are going to be talking about and how this relates back to your argument. Make sure when you quote your sources you respond to each of them with why is this important? Obviously you arent going to literally type that up but if you keep asking yourself Why? youll inevitably come away with some form of analysis. It might seem like its obvious enough at face value but your presumptions wont always line up with others. Dont ever settle for just because as justification for anything. Depending on whats being asked of you youll also want to reject or comment on other possible counter arguments or alternative answers and why they are or arent relevant.Conclusion This should pretty much be the intro but flipped over. Recap your body paragraphs then summarize why they prove your argument. Finally finish with something that really encapsulates why this is important relevant or even worthy of arguing in the first place.

9955607,0,t3_5i23ju,I find it interesting that you mention policies ... traditionally the socialist movement has considered itself a movement separate from the liberal nationstate democracy and thus doesnt use words like policies. Socialism is a system and school of thought totally separate from policy making and election platforms. It is very important to understand that socialism is not loyal to this tradition of right wing democracy but actually views it as quite undemocratic!That doesnt mean however that socialism cant align itself with liberal policies and consider them progressive and positive and in reality the border between socialism and liberalism have some soft parts. As many socialists here and elsewhere will point out social democracy isnt considered socialist but liberal. You will then see people refer you to democratic socialism which is socialism that tries to use the liberal or rather bourgeosois  read up on this word and how it connects to the socialist world view democracy as a platform to implement socialist thought and gradually transform nationstates to socialist democracies. Both social democrats and democratic socialists often belong to the same parties and can be said to be two factions inside the same movement. For example Tony Blair is a social democrat the most extremely right leaning social democrat you can find basically Jeremy Corbyn is leaning towards democratic socialism rather than social democracy Bernie Sanders is a social democrat that calls himself democratic socialism just like Olof Palme did a man who during different parts of his life aligned with both social democrat and democratic socialist tendencies. It is a very complex situation! But the important thing to remember is that social democracy is content with the welfare state and capitalism with the policies the movement legislated during the th century and all socialist factions oppose this pointless limiting of progression.Back to your first question. Many here can tell you the basic principles of socialism and have about workers control over their lives and about stopping exploitation. Chances are since you ask these questions in this manner that you dont feel especially exploited and even though stopping this horrible relationship between worker and owner is argument enough let me then tell you the point of view from my own socialist faction which might appeal to you with its broader wordingEverything should be democratic except the choice of your toothbrush so to speak. Voting with a firstpastthepost system or any other cobtemporary and lacking voting system for some people you have no real connection to make decisions in your name every few years is pointless. Democracy must mean more than passive consumer like choises. Democracy must also mean participation that there is a system where everyone can do political work for the community and that there is a culture that not only promotes political participation but also makes it friendly and not frightening and tiresome. Some people call this communism others call it anarchism. And thus this ties in to your third questionCommunism is both thus the endstate scenario where we have acheived total democracy as well as a faction with its separate tactic concerning how to acheive this. This tactic is to grab state power in a revolution and use it to gradually transform society into socialismcommunismanarchism like a really radical democratic socialist. Both tendencies believe using the nation state as vehicles for socialism is the way to go but democratic socialism doesnt believe revolution is necessary. Anarchism however believes that socialism has to be created separately from the capitalist nation states decentralised from the very beginning and then push away and perhaps outcompete the nationstates. Of course there are special cases where people have ideas that fall inbetween these tactical tendencies there are communists who are grouped inside the libertarian socialist umbrella together with anarchism and often social democrats communists and anarchists cooperate. And often theres infighting ... which historically have led to some extremely horrible results.Second question then Personally Im a libertarian socialist libertarian socialism is so hot right now and Im critical of communism just as Im critical of democratic socialism. But in the end this is merely disagreement on tactics and I consider them my comrades unless they try to be Stalin apologetics of course. Socialists do not view Stalin as socialist but there are people who like to counter American propaganda which is good but often it can go to far and people sort if slip into lessening the evils of Stalin and other failures of socialist revolutions. The ghosts of the cold war still walks among us.Last question Socialism is not only realistic it is necessary. We are creatures who need control of and participation in the fabric of our lives. We have a collective nature with families friends communities and a sense of a shared human experience. This collective relationship can only survive through solidarity and reason which is what socialism is. Everything else is defeatist and only realistic if you think competition struggle conflict and the destruction of organisations is something to strive for for some reason.,socialism,db58o61,2,t5_2qjii

Rather than immediately cranking the paranoia up to  think about what realistic threats you amp your organizations are facing from state actors to altright trolls.If you belong towork for a larger liberal organizations e.g. those affiliated with mainstream labor movement or working within the Democratic Party you should consider enacting internal policies that help increase email security like requiring everyone use twofactor authentication. This could have prevented the John Podesta email leaks.Organizations working closely with people directly threatened by the Trump administration e.g. immigrants amp religious minorities should consider extra steps to lock up any data relating to those they represent names addresses etc.If you suspect youre being monitored by a state actor its probably safest to avoid digital communication for any sensitive purpose regardless of how technical adept you are.Some common best practices Use twofactor authentication for all accounts email social media personal finance etc. Even if you dont use social media for any serious communication remember that someone who gains access to your account could pose as you. Use safe passwords. Dont reuse passwords. Regularly rotate passwords. XKCD provides a great example of how to create passwords that are hard to guess and easy to remember. Too many passwords? Use a password manager. Most browsers come with a builtin password manager! Purchase a VPN subscription  very useful if you frequent public WiFi When planning street level protests consider using a mesh networking app like FireChat ahead of time. This wont provide secure communication but it may bypass police attempts to shut down wireless networks like during SFs BART protests Consider storing sensitive information on cloud platforms e.g. Google Drive instead of hard copies  this will make it more challenging for law enforcement agencies to gain access to your data in event of a physical raid Encrypt your hard drive using a service like TrueCrypt  again this can protect your data in event that a law enforcement agency gains physical access,socialism,db7qal5,4,t5_2qjii

There are ways which tucker is right  I mean there is wide support for raising wages. But its clear that the opposition is the mega rich. Tuckers agreement with Elan in a means to dismiss and move from that topic is cover for the real opposition to higher wages.Tucker Carlson  Fox News And actually RNC  i consider Fox their media arm trying to convince or hammer the message that private union sector supports Trump. My own anecdotal evidence actually indicates this to be true.. and it needs to be analyzed further by revolutionary workers organizations.And the new narrative which I havent seen too much  i dont watch Fox news  is this admission that immigration adds to labor pool which drives wages down. I thought Elan did well on this point. but this focus on naturalized citizen working class shouldnt be too surprising from Fox News. It is surprising to see some admission to this. Finally the only thing which caused Tucker to change topics as quick as possible was when Elan started talking about Goldman Sachs. That got Tucker to change the topic quickly.

10187479,0,t1_dbx04fd,My two cents it stems from the hopelessness that many millennial workers feel about their economic prospects. Instead of revolt they feel coerced into participation as a matter of survival. It is hard to place blame on workers who simply wish to feed themselves.Part of the willingness to participate rather than revolt is probably driven by many still believing that someday in the future they will be able to afford the house and two cars that the Boomer generation enjoyed. Many Boomer parents pressure their kids to pursue that American dream because they do not understand that their generations economic success was likely a historical anomaly.Lastly and I know this is just a stream of consciousness post at this point it is hard to revolt when there does not seem to be a consensus amongst millennials that it is necessary. Most millennials agree that things are unfair but I dont think as a group that they are ready to actually stand up and say enough is enough.  A millennial on the tail end of the generationPS for what its worth I went to one of the best undergraduate institutions in the country and a T law school but finished my formal education right when the world economy went to shit.

10285464,0,t3_5n9a01,I reject the libertarianauthoritarian dichotomy to begin with because its fundamentally incoherent and idealist. It needs to be kept in mind that Leninism is a postOctober creation. The idea of a vanguard party in the Leninist sense was only universalised after the Bolshevik Revolution as a result of the lessons Lenin learned during the processes which unfolded. Believe it or not he didnt go into everything with a grand plan much of what we understand as Leninism today are conclusions the Bolsheviks drew from observation of historical processes around the world not from predetermined doctrinal practice. That is they took a Marxist approach.Theres also no real contradiction between the broader vision set out by Lenin in State and Revolution and the practice of building a revolutionary party. The revolutionary party is the instrument which leads the working class to power it itself is not the working class nor is it the workers state. One party dictatorship was not a matter of principle for the Bolsheviks it was something forced onto them by events and so there wouldve been no reason for Lenin to write SampR with that in mind.,socialism,dc9wwwv,11,t5_2qjii

Companies like Starbucks and RED have even made our guilt about these issues a commodity by donating  to congolese women or whatever for every x products sold.

But alright lets take another example ureyggg asked about.gtWhat about the professions that are paid handsomely for entertainment actors sports stars porn stars youtubers etc..YouTube is such a fantastic example of why monetary motivation is unnecessary or even counterproductive. Im sure most of us can remember a time when the idea of doing YouTube as a career was fucking ludicrous but there was still no shortage of quality content on YouTube. Many would argue the quality has gone down since its become so commercialized  the site has become absolutely polluted with clickbait and its harder and harder to find the small channels that are really doing something creative and entertaining and not just there because its become another way to make a buck.

10490891,0,t3_5q3vn6,Im a fan of Makhno but my perspective is close to the exact opposite of the person defending him in this thread. I appreciate his theory more and see his practice at times as some of the most morally ambiguous moments in anarchisms history. And its true as another poster mentions that the Free Territory didnt get that far on the economic angle of things.Making this subject much harder to approach is that there are very few if any sources on it that dont have some considerable bias considering the nature of the Russian Civil War and the niche status of the Makhno. Sources Ive read in English largely fall into three categories here antiMakhno works based on the Bolsheviks perspective proMakhno works from contemporary anarchists looking back and antiMakhno works based off White supporters religious groups and liberals. Some liberals can be somewhat positive towards him though. Theres some stuff coming out in the past couple years in Ukraine trying to recast him as a nationalist figure but I havent read any and its likely not of academic quality.The central focus of criticism of Makhno seems to be around perceived despotism on his part. Ive read things that point both ways that say he controlled RIA with an iron fist and that he didnt at all. As far as I can tell Makhno did personally select many officers but otherwise was pretty loose about military organization. Instances of antiJew pogroms are often mentioned as well. Makhno himself was pretty insistent against antisemitism and supported Jewish figures like Goldman having an audience for her at one point if I remember correctly. Despite this there is a strong possibility that parts of his military did enact pogroms its important to keep in mind that ALL militaries in the Russian Civil War had instances of this including the Red Army! This isnt to excuse these barbaric acts but military discipline was very difficult in these conditions and I dont think Makhno wouldve allowed such things to occur under his watch.The focus on antiJew pogroms is unfortunate though because it obfuscates atrocities that we can say happened in the Free Territory with certainty namely the Eichenfeld massacre. The only ambiguity there is whether Makhno personally OKed it or if the soldiers were doing their own thing. Makhno did have some very antiMennonite stuff in his journals Ive heard and made statements against them publicly as well. There are some anarchists out there that try to defend this or act like it was others at fault but honestly this reminds me of Furr more than anything. If youre interested in reading more about it this is a short article by an academic whos done a lot of work in this area.Now as to Makhnos theory I dont think its fair to just write him off as an ignorant peasant who couldnt put the Free Territory into words effectively when writing The Platform. This betrays that one hasnt even read it or understood the context of the document being that Makhno wrote it after the Free Territory was long gone in an attempt to impart some of what he learned in that experience not simply repeat it. I recommend just checking it out yourself sometime its a very straightforward work that I think would be approachable to many new socialists.,socialism,dcx942o,5,t5_2qjii

You may very well see an uprising on the left but it is being countered with an uprising on the right this is directly related to the institution bashing on the right.

10743695,1,t1_ddo3kaa,Man is a logical animal. My point is that suppression only makes those with differing ideals feel vindicated when a group tries to shut down discussion. To add to your point about not tolerating intolerance would Islam and many other ideologies not be included in such a statement about intolerance? Also historically when the left has tried to suppress those on the right and libertarians in violent ways in the name of tolerance it always ends badly for both sides mainly the left due to the right having more access to violent means such as weapons. All Im suggesting is that in the end violence and suppression hurts the views of both sides.

10780502,0,t1_ddrmwv7,Most contemporary pagans arent white supremacists although a strong and perhaps majority contingent in germanic paganism is based around racial identity. There are many pagan sects that arent concerned with race and plenty of pagans hold the position that they respect other pagan faiths but wouldnt abide by them because it would be intruding on another culture. Thats more for the sake of preventing cultural appropriation and such. White supremacist paganism basically doesnt exist in CelticDruidic paganism or Roman or Hellenic paganism but its not uncommon to see nazis with GermanicNorse pagan beliefs because of the Volkish movement in nazi Germany and a number of white supremacist ideologues like David Lane and Else Christensen who proposed Wotanism and Odinism as belief systems inherent to white Germanic peoples and therefore belonging to them and opposed to the moral corruption of liberal western Christian society.That being said there are plenty of Germanic and Norse pagan groups that refuse racial alignment such as The Troth. Currently the only practicing Norse pagan temple in the world in Iceland also holds a nonracial view. Racialism in paganism is more to do with nazis being attracted to paganism than it is pagans being attracted to nazism. Its diverse like any other group.But yeah fuck pagan white supremacists fuck volkists etc.,socialism,ddrxi7r,2,t5_2qjii

Yugoslavia and the other exsocialist countries had to embark on that process in one of the most hostile environments possible  with the entire forces of capital and imperialism at their throats. This creates many more challenges for the socialist government.Look to Cuba as a perfect example of a country that is not particularly wealthy where the needs of all of the people are not always met  but which is miles ahead of other Caribbean countries or capitalist countries with a similar wealth because it has a socialistic system of production and distribution.,socialism,ddyza3k,6,t5_2qjii

10871643,0,t3_5vdhzs,Fascism is enabled as a persistent ideology through fear and material conditions. Since capitalism is the source for all modern material conditions and fear waxes and wanes depending on multiple factors that can fairly easily be pointed back to capitalism corporate media economic boom and bust cycles manufactured labor excess manufactured good shortage fascism is a constant threat to any and all capitalist states. This is why fascism is an issue in right leaning and left leaning capitalist states US and Sweden for example.

10881438,0,t1_de1vxnd,You misunderstood my question. How does not calling a fascist a fascist make them stop being a fascist? This argument only makes sense if someone is more or less considering becoming a fascist and theyre talking about it with you. If theyre already a fascist I really do not understand how not calling them a fascist makes them stop being one.gtIf a wave of nice people invade an alt right facebook page and nicely ask for data backing up their claims then if presented with evidence politely and logically demolish those claims youll get people more likely to listen to what you have to say.I tried that for a long long time. I changed maybe or two minds not completely only one one specific issue through argumentation in thousands and thousands of conversations. These people create pseudoscience about each and every ethnic group in the world and construct from that a racial hierarchy. These people speak in code and dog whistles and view any contradictory evidence no matter how compelling as proof of a conspiracy against them therefore their side is right. Theyre like conspiracy theorists in that way. Ultimately why is it preferable to get fascists to listen than it is to destroy their ability to make negative changes in the world?gtThere is a time to take a militant attitude toward fascism but thats only if fascists strike first.How do you define strike? I feel like their current political wave is very clearly their first strike their genocidal rhetoric is clearly a first strike.

The cost for which is made practicable by virtue of technological deflation.gt it is far less clear how they could protect access to resources. This is the case where economic verticals can be reproduced via automation. gton the public trust idea i am not sure how you expect it to work. if the ruling class can usurp the tax collectorThe difference is that the public trust is a stockholder. You may as well say if a stockholder can usurp another stockholder. This is what I mean by entangle the fates of private shareholders and the public at large.gtand if they have no active interst in any plan that benefits the masses it is not clear why they would accept the existence of this trust.This class of corporation would not be able to prevent such a trust from purchasing shares of their corporation. gt why not try to buy it outdismantle it etc.Because you want the corporation to continue to operate for the benefit of its shareholders and the public trust. gtthis can be made impossible by legislationThis can be made possible by legislation. gtwe are proposing tougher regulation and state oversightThere is no tougher oversight than that of the shareholders. The public trust is an active shareholder and will probably be able to demand board representation. gtif we radicalise a little we will become new deal democrats.I dont think that such a proposal would be considered as a ilttle radical.

11148247,0,t1_devlc47,The LTOV is not exclusively marxist it has its roots in John Locke and is central to classical economics it is a Marxist tenet but not a marxist invention I dont know what you mean by ecological rift and historical materialism at least in is vulgar basics prim communism gt slave society gt feudalism gt capitalism gt etc. the basesuperstructure distinction are reject by many leftists either for its eurocentrism the stages of history takes European history as normative reductionism many thinkers believe the dependence of superstructure on base is reductive albeit the modern understanding of this is more lateEngels than it is Marx nonetheless it is Marxism and optimism after the twentieth century and stuff like Fordism and Fascism some have less than total faith in the destiny of the proletariat and thus include minorities and activists into the necessary revolutionary strata.With nuance one can agree and disagree with all of this and still remain a Marxist or nonMarxist.  I find the titles ultimately useless and while I have read enough I can certainly be called a Marxist I would only claim to be such with nuance I agree with too much th century stuff to identify with a midth century thinker   with an ist or ian.  In the American context Eugene Debs was no Marxist in thought or organization but he was good enough in action to rally from demsoc to anarchist to his side and many Marxists were among them.  Meanwhile the SPD in Germany declared itself Marxist while it slaughtered the Spartacists with protofascist militias.  I think reading is good labels are unnecessary except in the final instance Red vs White Bolshevik vs Menshevik and big tents come in different varieties.  None of these are necessarily tied to the other and I think the ideal path involves reading and cooperation.  ,socialism,devn48d,11,t5_2qjii
11154944,0,t3_5z9e26,I see this issue pop up sometimes but it seems misguided. I dont think socialism is necessarily concerned with the issue of guns which means that it could go either way depending on how the society itself feels. A socialist society may deem it fit to have free or strict access to guns if its principles line up that way. I dont see a reason why a society with a socialist economic model would necessarily fall into one stance on the issue. Meaning a person can still support socialism regardless of their stance on guns. Other socialists may disagree somewhat but it doesnt define what socialism is for them so it wouldnt be that big of an argument. ,socialism,dewegc2,11,t5_2qjii

Theres a reason why precisely  out of  of the original Council of Peoples Commissars survived long enough to die of natural causes and why communism is inseperable from deportations in myriad areas of Eastern Europe. For christs sakes he presided over a government that put indigenous Khanty children in boarding schools and suppressed the ensuing revolt like a North American settler leader.

11558128,0,t1_dg48gum,Venezuelan here. Been living in the US for the last  years. I agreedisagree with everything stated in this thread but lets make things clear  Venezuela isnt a socialist country per se.  ChavezCurrent government were not revolutionary in their ideas of wealth distribution.  Venezuelas downfall has been a combination of corruption and compulsory nepotism. On the first point you are correct. Venezuela does function in a capitalistlike structure not neoliberal free market. The state has nationalized the major industries of production and all natural resources. The backbone of this strategy has been even before Chavez generating revenue to subsidize social programs in the country. I.E. subsidizing gas to make it affordable for all Venezuelans building public hospitals schools and housing creating markets that sale subsidized products food meds electronics etc. for cheaper access for all Venezuelans. Mind you there was always a parallel private provider for all the aforementioned services and goods except gas which was price regulated altogether by the state.This brings me to the next point. Chavezs socialist ideas werent new to Venezuela therefore not revolutionary. The practices that Chavez construed as new had been around for decades before his coming to power. Access to subsidized public education public health services gasoline food etc. had been commonplace and established by prior governments ever since the oil boom allowed the funds to do so. My parents now in their s benefited from statesubsidized higher education they both attended state universities specifically LUZ for example.What Im trying emphasize is programs of this nature have been embedded in Venezuelas culture before Chavezs first term. Chavez was merely the first politician to label it socialism. Personally Im sure the vast majority of the Venezuelan opposition which the government recurrently characterizes as evil feudalist and bourgeoise regards the former subsidized services as inherent rights for Venezuelans ensuring such things is regarded as the governments job not a gratuity.However its the majority of the opposition also doesnt oppose the availability of private equivalents for those who desire to not utilize the statesubsidized resources. This doesnt imply being waived from taxation or being refunded for services not used. Simply means being able to opt out from services and paying for the alternative yourselfThe world constantly asks what brought Venezuela to its current situation was it socialism? was it Chavez? No. The cause has been in its face a matter of corruption nepotism and greed. As youve pointed out and most people on this thread have agreed Venezuelas primary economic activity is oil extraction and refining which in its prime created enough revenue to sustain not only itself but also all our socialized services along with nominal taxes paid by Venezuelans. When Chavez came into power PDVSA the state owned oil company was in all aspects from CEOs and CFOs all the way down to oil field roughnecks run by employees that possessed the skills relevant to their positions. Chavez changed that when he literally at his leisure appointed underskilled friends family political colleagues to managerial positions in PDVSA and dismissing anybody that openly dissented his policies. These actions eventually dominoed and those underskilled friends family and colleagues of Chavez went on to appoint their own underskilled friends family and colleagues to vital positions within the company. This explains PDVSAs deficient performance which itself translates to a decrease in revenue which ultimately translates to underfunded socialized services. More recently with Venezuelan oil becoming less marketable than its OPEC counterparts mainly due to being heavier and therefore more expensive to process the state has attempted to subsidize its social welfare programs with oil revenue that just doesnt exist. Currently in lieu of guaranteeing subsidized prices for services the government has implemented stronger control over the prices of its private counterparts the government mandated prices are asinine and unrealistic in correlation to the costs of materials and overhead  which has led the private sector to shutting down altogether or modifying its production strategies to comply with the state mandated prices  this is ultimately what has caused scarcity and inflation. Its evident the root of the issue isnt the private sector alone but the government officials incapacity lack of expertise and greed that has caused the grievances of all Venezuelans. This is why I find its justifiable for people to regard socialism even when it isnt exactly so as negative because this perception isnt a product of their ignorance of socialist theory alone but rather of the misconstruction and use of the word by pseudosocialist governments themselves. TLDR Chavezs government and its allies have taken a huge shit on socialism themselves. ,socialism,dg649ck,3,t5_2qjii

Genocide is central to their ideology and no matter how they dress up their words they are using them to incite systemic violence against minority groups. Personal violence against someone inciting systemic violence is arguably even nobler than personal violence against someone using personal violence in other words defense of another a perfectly legal and moral justification for physical force.As another thought exercise lets ask ourselves when exactly violence becomes acceptable to use against nazis. We can all agree that violence has been used to topple nazis in the past. Youd be hard pressed to find anyone who disagrees with the destruction of the Third Reich correct? After all the holocaust was an abomination against humanity. Hitler was evil. But what if we could have toppled Hitler before the concentration camps? Would it have been justifiable? I think so. Does an atrocity need to be committed before the perpetrators are dealt with? In America we charge murder premeditation as murder itself.

If you are in university or not start or join a Socialism club as someone else here said. Id consult with the guidance counselor a school handbook outlining their policies against bullying and possibly an attorney if the school doesnt intervene and is unwilling to do so if the bullying becomes more severe than those slurs.I assume that the backlash you are receiving from the adults is that because communism is a criticism of capitalism and an appeal to the conscience and no one likes to face their conscience you are being bullied for it. I hope you live up to those principles of solidarity.Godspeed.,socialism,dgeqm8x,1,t5_2qjii

11665788,0,t3_66d1dy,gt Francis of Assisi had been unusually holy even for saints. His father had been a rich businessman and he grew up in a world of luxury sports and feasting. One day he was out selling cloth for his fathers business when a beggar approached him and asked for alms. Francis tossed him a coin and the beggar went away. Then he sat and thought for a few minutes. Then he ran after the beggar caught up with him and gave him everything he had.gt When he told his father what had happened the old man was outraged. Why had he blown away his money like that? Well why indeed? Francis couldnt answer. He just thoughtwell doesnt the Bible say we should do good? Not that much good Francis!gt His father sent Francis off to war. On the way to battle Francis saw another knight with worse armor than he and gave the man his armor. Apparently he was no more a soldier than a merchant.

Moreover the problem that I find with universities and colleges is that it is this sort of perpetuation of colleges and universities only doing this for money nowadays instead of actually promoting intellectual thought and knowledge. Further I find college and university to be a scam due to the greed and exploitation of young adults entering trying to earn a degree so that they can feel like they have done something worthwhile in their lives when in reality they are entering into the biggest scam that will continue unless they leave college and pay off that debt. ,socialism,dgprawq,6,t5_2qjii

Ive seen multiple posts videos tweets just a large variety of social media coming from the Altright and their nazi counterparts that is focused on exposing those involved with AntiFa. Quite recently as of yesterday i saw that pols had created an entire list of people associated with AntiFa had doxxed them made their personal information readily available to anyone in the altright to have access to. Im sure this has been going on for some time now but lately due to the surge in AntiFa protests I feel as though it will only continue to rise and possibly lead to violence against our fellow comrades.

11799589,0,t1_dgx8cgm,Absolutely. As a shareholder your sole purpose is to give your money to someone else to fund their ventures and with that you expect a return because you are taking a major risk. If that venture fails you fail to make an even return. It isnt only rich people that invest are shareholders but there are also middle class people that do it. Their life savings could be in said venture the return may pay for their retirement a house or childrens education. I think the hate for shareholders is because of most people being in the middle class realm so they unfairly hate those that spend their disposable income on things that will help them financially. Whilst they can only spend their money on necessities or have other interests. Such is life. ,socialism,dgxivn8,5,t5_2qjii
