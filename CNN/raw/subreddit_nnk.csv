5286628,0,t1_cvndvey,Well NNS is currently in DGs hands.He always talked about how we should stray from the NNK traditional gameplay and go commercial. More up to date in terms of gameplay and so on.Its not a bad thing but being the one guy that stuck around since  and literally used every bit of his motivation to push this project through I really wanted to keep NNKs soul intact. Advancing it while still keeping it an underground Naruto game.I could have stayed and work on NNS but NNK was really my baby and I just cant stand looking at it going in these other directions.This by the way happened before. After R was released.I will probably talk about it more in the live stream. ,nnk,cvnfg8i,1,t5_2wnwu
