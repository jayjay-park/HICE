3486478,0,t1_cppocv4,It means you might have a Sirius radio as opposed to an XM radio. If you have a Sirius radio then your trial will include Sirius Select as opposed to XM Select. Sirius Select does include Howard Stern NFL and NASCAR. But it doesnt include streaming you still have to get Sirius All Access for that. Same prices same terms the only difference is the type of radio you have and the premium channels you get with the Select package. XM Select gives you Oprah Martha Stewart and Opie while Sirius Select gives you Howard NFL and NASCAR.,siriusxm,cppom9h,1,t5_2swe4
5477567,0,t1_cw7e4hb,Ive only called to cancel radios followed by me saying no to many deals to keep it. Then come the many more phone calls later to come back ...,siriusxm,cwbt6ks,1,t5_2swe4
8054319,0,t1_d4l68yj,Hmm. That makes sense as I know RDS for FM radio works in a similar fashion  except that one DOES resolve fully with my Kenwood unit it just takes a few seconds before all of the information is there.But Ill be tuned to an XM station for long periods of time like an hour or two sometimes and the name NEVER goes above  characters if not only for a second or two before it changes.Given what you said Im thinking this is Kenwoods problem either the head unit itself has some update to fix it or nobody complained so they never fixed it.I was going to comment on how the reception should be fine because Im using the same rooftop antenna that my cars factory unit had but then I remembered that the factory one did the same thing.  Maybe thats also a culprit.  Are there better antennas these days? I tried one of the cheap ones like the  ones which is cheap for a car part and it made no difference  the reception was actually worse than using the rooftop because I had to keep it inside my car and under the windshield.Interesting note about the Xtra Channels.  I was actually miffed about streamingonly stations... a bit offtopic butWhen Road Trip Radio premiered I happened to notice it as a newly added channel while browsing and immediately loved it.  Added it as one of my presets.A month or two later they were playing a loop saying Were moving to a new channel saying it was some channel in the s iirc while my tuner only goes up to something.  I called the SiriusXM customer service and asked if my tuner needed an update to get those channels because mine didnt have anything in the s and the guy told me those ones are webonly.  I said well thats odd it didnt SAY webonly it just gave a channel number and he told me theyd take that into consideration and possibly change the broadcast.Months later I noticed it came back this time on channel  which seems to be used for limitedtime channels and just shifts every month or two.  They recently killed it off again like a week ago or something now its lightrock Yacht Rock radio.Is there truly no way to get the other channels in the s besides paying for streaming? Its not that I object to streaming but its a massive waste of my data plan when I have an antenna on the car anyway... when I saw the Xtra Channels were in the s I got hopeful for a minute until I clicked the link and saw it was only a tiny number of them not including Road Trip Radio.  Meh.,siriusxm,d4ldqsg,1,t5_2swe4

9717472,0,t3_5dtxzt,Fallout from clear channel digging their hooks into it seriously.Ive seen in places that it used to be a utopia from regular radio but quickly went down the tubes during the mergers and such.Any of them oldiescountry ss etc have the same annoying dj format and tightly looped playlists.Its what makes me hesitate getting a subscription can program a larger playlist in my mobile device or flash sticks and play that in my truck versus a top  format,siriusxm,daaw0vu,2,t5_2swe4

11788838,0,t1_dgwadah,if youre not big into talk radio or sports you can talk to the rep about Mostly Music Just the music channels and its even less expensive. The offer that Sirius has at the moment is basically  a month.the  months for  is the same price its just the length of the plan that changes thats why they got rid of the for and went to for. Those that Negotiate for the other deal are not really even saving anything.Dont forget theres always the US Music licence fee and tax so Ive seen  end up anywhere between  and  depending on where you live.,siriusxm,dgwaypx,2,t5_2swe4
