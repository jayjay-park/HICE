2758468,0,t3_2i3e81,Name Sonia BowmanAlias ScribeAge Philosophy DefendersMain Power Ink Manipulation  Sonia can control ink in the same way someone would control water able to both control and create it. For example she could launch a ball of ink at someone in order to distract or attack them. Another thing that I thought might be cool is if she can manipulate and use the tattoos on her body as part of the ink manipulation as detailed here. An example of this would be if she had a tattoo of a sword she could manifest it and use the ink tattoo as an actual sword albeit made out of solid ink. In terms of combat with this ability she would only have a sword tattoo that she can use for now but I was thinking that as she ranks up and becomes stronger she could get more tattoos for more weapons.Minor Power Fourth Wall Awareness  Like I went over with Light this wouldnt be anything reality warping or omniscient just the knowledge that she is a fictional character so that she can make a few jokes and comments. Weakness Salt can stop her ink constructs in their path and can absorb any ink that she creates. It can also stop her from having control or creating any ink.Drawbacks The more ink she creates and controls the more tired she will become. Large quantities  Large amounts of energy basically. Another drawback is a more social one. Due to her ability to recognize the fourth wall people often think that she is insane which is not helped by her usually volatile personality.Born Pilot City,HeroRP,cnhmkyk,1,t5_33kf2

2768740,0,t1_cnisgmj,OOC Maria is an orphan.  She ran away from the orphanage and lived as a thief on the streets.  She has trust issues because everyone was trying to screw her over.  Im not going to use rape as a backstory but she doesnt like being touched and freaks out from it.  In terms of having the scarf touched she lost Carlis in a big fight and he fell helplessly into a river.  It took her a week to find him and she was pretty broken up over it.   I probably shouldve put that in her intro post....sorry....its why Carlis shakes peoples hands and not her.IC I....no not molested but.....Maria sighed and wiped her tearsJust please dont touch Carlis.  Please.,HeroRP,cnisnas,1,t5_33kf2
