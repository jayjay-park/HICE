7565366,0,t3_4ivgai,I for sure feel like story driven games are being phased out biggest example Halo. Halo  story was extremely disappointing compared to the others in the franchise. Microsoft did nothing to hide the fact they spent a TON of time with the MLG community creating a faster paced PvP game. Im not surprised Overwatch is PvP only made for an ESports arena that is Blizzards thing. But on the counter to that there have been a large number of PvE exclusive games or games that have minimal PvP that are story driven. Fallout Tomb Raider Uncharted Ratchet and Clank Division Quantum Break ect. Thinking about it shooter based games are often shaped for competitive PvP play now a days. That would hurt the casual shooter gamer who wants a story driven FPS but the casual gamer who wants story in general there are plenty out there. I agree with Duro with making more coop games I miss the couch parties.,MulehornGaming,d32593e,4,t5_3ek4z

Fortunately weve been able to build extensive online communities that help us find friends to play with fairly easily when games are popular.  When it becomes tougher is as player bases dwindle and fewer people are playing.  My fear has been that this game will lose steam as people get bored with doing the same thing over and over but I may be wrong.  Fighting games mainstream sports games and Rocket League have pretty repetitive game play mechanics and they are able to hold a player base so Overwatch could too.  If they support this game post launch with additional characters maps and new game modes they could keep the hype train rolling for a long time.,MulehornGaming,d3us15d,2,t5_3ek4z
