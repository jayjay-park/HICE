8179812,0,t3_4rcwsz,Also could you clarify if the Pokemon on Showdown should be set to level  or defaulted at level ? It might clear up some confusion too. ,UCLOfficial,d500xtz,1,t5_3991h
8208260,0,t1_d53k7u5,No the most relevant coverage moves Ambipom has are the ones used to hit normalresists i.e. Steel and Rock types these moves are Seed Bomb and Brick Break which arent boosted by Technician. When it comes to taking on the role of an offensive normal type even NU choices like Tauros and Kangaskhan are fundamentally better because they do a better job at weakening things used to check them.If you want to find out in more detail as to why Ambipom is a subpar Pokemon you can check out Smogons RU Viability Rankings thread here ,UCLOfficial,d53l5ig,0,t5_3991h
