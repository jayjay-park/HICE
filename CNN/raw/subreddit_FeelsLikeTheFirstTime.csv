2996529,0,t3_2udvih,Story time! My first time seeing fireflies was just this past summer! I had never seen them before and thought I was having a stroke. Just walking through the woods and I saw this slight flash. I was like is that coming from the camp site? or....did someone flash a light over? I brushed it off and thought I was seeing things when it happened again. So I started looking through the bushes for the source of the tiny flickering light but I couldnt find it. I thought it was a waste of time so I kept walking and I just about missed a clearing to my right that overlooked a pond swarming with fireflies! Im glad it caught my eye because it was the freaking coolest thing ever! Havent seen a single one since...but wowwee!,FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,co8l67g,2,t5_368tm

It was strange knowing that someone could go the majority of their life without knowing what their genitalia looked like.I was happy knowing that those women could explore their bodies for the first time and I smiled when that one girl said it was a relief that hers looked so normal. When the majority of man see a vagina its just that a vagina. The fact that I can see it means Im doing something right I now have access to a forbidden part of a womans body. I get to do the unspeakable unless of course youre with a group of male friends. To me there is no such thing as an ugly vagina. The fact that I can see it and the fact that my face is so close to it means that I am performing the expected of me I am man and I have confidence that I can now perform. ,FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,cok2j7e,43,t5_368tm

Because Im am Argentine and Im about to tell you how to make it properly. You fill the gourd with loose leaves until its around half full. Maybe . You then cover the opening with your hand and tilt it or shake it so all the fine powder goes to the top and it doesnt obstruct the metal straw. Make sure to leave a tiny mountain of yerba the name of the leaves on one side of the mate. Then you add the water pouring it in the valley next to the mountain of yerba until the gourd is full and then you stick the metal straw again in the valley. This will make it so the flavor lasts longer and the straw doesnt get obstructed.  Also if you add sugar you should be punished with exile.Finally the grapefruit is used to make terere which is mate bit with cold water or cold fruit juice. It is true that mate is a very social drink and its also the kind of thing you dont refuse to anyone. If I was with my friends drinking mate and my worst enemy came and asked for a mate I would probably give them one.,FeelsLikeTheFirstTime,d75j1qm,4,t5_368tm
