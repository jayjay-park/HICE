2887521,0,t3_2t560y,I prefer Big Reactors Im not sure if it is better or worse but I always goto that after I use a single Steam Dynamo to get me by in survival.I really like Big Reactors and not sure what better Fission Reactors can be as they are already really great.  I asked about it but no one seemed to have an answer.You can adjust the rods height in  increments which affects how fast it burns and how much power you get.  You can hook a computer to a computer port and even have it manage it turning off when power isnt needed and back on when the batteries are about to run out.There is also a machine you can make to recycle the waste to provide a little bit more efficiency.  They also look really cool especially cooled reactors with something like unstable redstone flowing through it.,technicpack,cnwbbiu,1,t5_2t4tq

2984901,0,t1_co7c039,No I havent was thinking about just making my own with the ones we like Thermal Expansion Galactic Craft Applied Energistics and so on but dont want to have to deal with having to keep them updated and compatible. Yeah I know about  Minecraft is in java and isnt coded very well performancewise.  My point is if it is out there chances are people are using it and most likely with less hardware than me.,technicpack,co7drqi,1,t5_2t4tq
6927247,0,t3_49p3nx,Sounds like you need to check for dependencies.  You likely have a few addon mods that require thaumcraft to work.  Btw I totally agree.  Thaumcraft is in every modpack ever its obnoxious with flux and ugly world generation is extremely tedious to play and offers tons of risk to use and nothing worth having in return,technicpack,d11j1ic,1,t5_2t4tq
