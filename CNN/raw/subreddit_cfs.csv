52729,0,t3_1u3q7k,I think I am a little better I started doing the aerobic threshold thing in January. I was able to start a walking program in March. I can walk up to  miles every other day although usually I can only do . The summer I had gotten sick I had planned to take up kayaking as a hobby but couldnt due to being bedridden. After six years of waiting to get better  I was able to paddle my kayak on flat water for up  hours many times. My boyfriend is wonderful he helps me cartop it and get it down to the waters edge then waits for me onshore while I paddle. Its heaven. I was able to paddle into November. Looking forward to getting out early this year.  I did not have my usual fall collapse when the weather turned cold nor have I collapsed now during the southward extension of the polar vortex. Crashes are few and far between. I only had  cold this year but it was doozy about  weeks to get back to normal.  My tolerance for caffeine has increased. I take that to mean that my heart is a little stronger now. Previously caffeine made me feel like the alien was ready to jump out of my chest.On the other hand I have made zero progress on my messy house. It seems I can keep up with only the most basic things like dishes laundry cat boxes meanwhile entropy increases. Although it only took a week to decorate the Christmas tree this year and I actually got it done before Christmas. I wonder how long its going to take to get it down.,cfs,cekfm0r,2,t5_2r4lw

190140,0,t3_1w9yqb,I too find it easier to sleep during the day. Its called Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder Ive had it since I was a kid. That doesnt mean its impossible to sleep at night just that its harder for us. I also have an anxietydepression disorder so I know how it feels.OK lots you can do to bust out of the rut Drugs. Antidepressants tranquilizers and sleeping pills abound. Antidepressants work on depression and anxiety. They also help with chronic pain so if youre experiencing pain from the CFS they can help. SNRIs or SSRIs are what are typically prescribed. They have fewer side effects and are prolly more effective. Tricyclics are an older class of AD but many are sedating so they can double as sleeping pills. These pills arent addictive but you cant cold turkey on them either. If you start taking them you have to stick with them or taper. Tranquilizers such as lorazepam can help you get to sleep in the evening and can also be used for anxiety. But they can be very addictive. Sleeping pills come in all kinds. Some tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed at lower doses for sleep some tranquilizers are prescribed for sleep and then there are things specifically designed for sleep like ambien. I take a half dose of ambien it works great for me. I have been taking it for years and dont experience any side effects at this time. In the past I used to eat in the middle of the night. Made myself stop. The problem with these is they can get you over the hump but you become dependent upon them. Ive had lifelong insomnia so I figured Id rather take a pill than continue to fight the insomnia forever.  Pain relievers. If you have pain it will keep you from falling asleep. If you are already taking something for pain SSRISNRI Lyrica GABA etc... or not you can take an OTC pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen at bedtime. Whether or not you can take one with some sleep meds in it depends on what other drugs you already take. Some folks here swear by MMJ. Its not an option for me where I live so I cant comment on its effectiveness. If you want to learn more about drugs for sleep read Insomniac by Greene there is one chapter on drugs. Behaviors for sleep The biggest things you can do is  Get up at the same time every day no matter what. Set the alarm for whatever and get up when it goes off.  Do not nap. You want your bodys desire for sleep to build up sleep pressure. Napping relieves the pressure. I understand that you cant stay awake during the day. If you really have to nap keep it under an hour. Set a timer. Use a kitchen timer or an app or if you google  minute timer you can use your browser to beep you in  minutes. They say you shouldnt nap more than  minutes but I find that too short.   No caffeine after lunchtime noon. That includes tea coffee decaf soda energy drinks etc...  If you want to learn more about good habits and coping behaviors for sleep read Sleep Right in Five Nights by Perl. Instead of lying awake at night you can read it. I found it very helpful. There are more things you can do for anxiety. Exercise ha ha like we can but it works great. No doubt our inability to exercise and exercise hard leads to our anxiety. Meditate or do relaxation exercises daily. Read Full Catastrophe Living by KabatZinn. Excellent book. Also stay away from caffeine. Even chocolate has caffeine and too much of it can aggravate anxiety. Other things Get f.lux for your computer it dims your screen at night. Avoid TV tablets that dont have f.lux or equivalent bright lights etc... at night. Light therapy might help you reset your clock. Visit cet.org and take the quizes to see if it would help you. Sleep studies are discussed in the FAQ. Also dont obsess if you dont sleep. Missing one night is usually not a big deal. You wont feel good but you wont collapse. If you cant sleep find something quiet to do like read. Or lie there and rest and dont worry if you sleep or not. Its okay. Enjoy the darkness and the quiet and know that you will get some rest just from relaxing in bed.,cfs,cf03hnr,2,t5_2r4lw

I once became so obsessed with it I spent hours researching the perfect shoe because I was adamant that I was going to get better and go running. I think a lot of us were quite active people before cfs so its like being forced to live a life that doesnt fit with your personality and who u are at ur core.

1114562,0,t3_26vftu,I work from home. I started my own Web content business before my CFS progressed to where I am now. I have a team of writers and serve as the editor for client work. But I rarely work more than two hours in any given day because of the mental fatigue. I couldnt report to an office job anymore... even  minutes of physical activity like folding laundry is enough to trigger PEM so the stresses of reporting to a job somewhere else would never work. My husband gets up and gets our son on the bus each morning so I can sleep. Im home to get our son off the bus in the afternoon. Im very grateful that our sons independence has increased over the last year as my illnesses have increased in severity.I waste a lot of time on the Internet but at least tangentially building up my social media accounts is a form of marketing.

If it is comorbid with CFS then it should be checked for and if present treated to provide some symptom relief. I have other comorbid conditions and once I got those fixed I felt better.

1922298,0,t3_2gmwwc,That sounds awfully difficult. The puppies and bunnies were a wise decision though.Were not docs of course and I could guess that the unusual physical discomfort you feel is a result of unrelieved exhaustion. But thats really just a guess. Its also possible that something else is making you restless and uncomfortable wearing you down and driving the exhaustion ahead of it. Given your medical history Im sure you know your way around and I doubt there is anything I can suggest about relaxation or pacing or getting the most from your doctors that would be new to you. I can suggest electrolyte or hormone issues can sometimes cause the crawlyrestless stuff but Im sure your docs have already considered that as well.My frontline method of handling physical discomfort is marijuana despite living in a state where its not legal I can discuss that in depth if you like many of us here and in the fibro community have found it helpful to varying degrees. I can make another wild guess and suggest maybe a sleep study could help if something has changed that makes your nightly sleep less restful that can cause a cascade of unpleasant symptoms and for the most part people with these sorts of sleep problems dont know and cant know that they have a problem until they are properly tested.

2703780,0,t1_cnb7ze7,Thank you for sharing your experiences.Im thankfully not at the point of being disappointed or crushed when something doesnt work and never hold that expectation.  Trying new stuff isnt a stressor for me sort of the opposite as I know Im doing all I can within my limits then I can feel Im still useful  good at something.So far Ive lost my job fun fancy large scale IT projects  brain puzzles lost my cohabiting partner of  years. The brain fog is far more crippling than the pain so reading novels is no good my wit  mental abilities that I heavily relied on to define myself are mush and stamina has dropped from an km run to an exerted push to make a  minute walk and a nap.  So Im accepted the situation and just doing what I can.  I know something is wrong with my bodymind and with the chronic pain randomly everywhere I dont put much value in a lot of my bodys feedback.  So if I get a sugar craving Ill have a salad if I need to eat yucky thing  for a month to try and make a difference I will.  It can be hard to keep track of everything but its my goal to keep investing in my health.The only bad result any test has shown so far is mild arthritis in my feet amp hands amp shoulders so I want to ensure that all my other systems are in good shape once I get this fatigue thing sorted out and dont have another year of physio amp new diet habits amp heart medication  whatever complications a low energy lifestyle can lead to without being monitored effectively.TLDR If I stop experimenting with new approaches Ill just curl up amp sleep for the fact that theres nothing else I can do.,cfs,cnber5s,1,t5_2r4lw

2857220,0,t3_2sl9qv,I took gabapentin for  years and it really helped my sleep in a nice subtle way not a knockyouout kind of way. I would take between mg  night a few hours before bed.That being said I decided to cycle off of it last year just to give my body a rest and it turned out to be moderately difficult requiring tapering the dose down over a couple of weeks and I still experienced about a week of pretty bad rebound insomnia. But thats not the interesting part...A couple weeks after stopping the gabapentin after my sleep was finally back to normal I started noticing that I was much more verbally fluent in work meetings and my word recall seemed to be greatly improved. At first I just chalked it up to being a little less hung over from the gabapentin as it would tend to make me feel a bit tired in the morning but it seemed more significant than that. After doing some reading I came across the link below which discusses a study where researchers found that gabapentin strongly inhibits the brains ability to form new synapses. This is especially problematic for kids taking gabapentin but based on my experience Id say it had a significant negative impact on my word recall and memory in general.Im not saying that Id never take gabapentin again if my sleep got really bad as sleep deprivation probably isnt good for forming new synapses either but its worth considering taking periodic drug holidays to get a clearer idea of how these things are affecting our bodies long term.

2905616,0,t3_2tet4r,As you know there are lots of things that can make you feel miserable. Hypothyroidism is certainly one possibility and a simple blood test will tell you if you have it or not. Thats really the only way to be sure. The good news is that it is generally easy to fix.Keep in mind that some people believe that there is a class of thyroid disorders Adrenal fatigue that do not show up on standard tests but which requires unusual testing that does not have either a welldefined baseline or clear clinical significance.

3121463,0,t3_2vv72k,I had actually been thinking about making a post about this recently.  I feel like Im finally to a state where I feel more normal than not.  I dont know if this is something where Ill ever feel  but It no longer dominates my thoughts in day to day life.  In fact I have days where I hardly think about it at all now.  I mean I still cant be super physical and still avoid triggers like alcohol and coffee but on the whole during a standard day quality of life is much improved.For me what worked was time and gradual exercise.  I was lucky to to naturally make progress over time albeit extremely slowly but once I got to a certain point I found I was able to accelerate progress with gradual exercise. The toughest part about it is you want to see results and hit milestones so youll want to push yourself.  Self restraint is hard and going too fast is dangerous.  I kept myself to a very slow pace and had my fair share of setbacks. In the beginning I could only manage walking around the block I lived on once and could do that twice a week.  It took me over a year and a half to be able to walk a mile.  It was a big deal for me a little less then a year after that when I hit  miles.  I remember clearly the first time I did a little too much but got tired instead of fatigued.  Theres such an important difference between those words and it had been years since I had felt it. Now another year after that point my body has some amount of resilience. I can exert within limits get tired sleep it off and be back on my feet the next day.  Im not going to go train for a marathon or anything but Im not as held back from experiencing life. its a great feeling.  All together it has taken about  years to get to where I am now.While Im stoked to be able to share a positive story in this sub Id like to throw out a word of caution. CFS is essentially a blanket term that describes a certain spectrum of symptoms. While many of us may share the same underlying cause there are certainly many who do not.  What worked for another may not work for you. If you try something like gradual exercise be careful go slow listen to your body. Some people will respond to it some wont.  The most important thing is to try to stay positive.  Its hard when dealing with something thats so disruptive to just living life but if you lose it it will make moving forward so much worse.  I wish you the best.  Hopefully its you sharing a positive post in this sub at some point.,cfs,coljed3,3,t5_2r4lw

4886477,0,t1_cua3hhe,I had a similar problem getting digestion problems when I overdid it and just feeling really ill. At some point after a bit of looking around I found the anecdote of a doctor with CFS. She recommends intermittent fasting. I.E for a few days a week you get all your food in a  hour window.I saw the people asking if the immune system reset in mice after fasting for  days would work for us. I wondered how relevant it was. So I called a family friend whos studied medicine and went through the whole story she explained that while mice arent particularly similar to humans weve not properly focused on food amp digestions effect on human health  weve been preoccupied with curing diseases so we simply dont know if its true that fasting will help your immune system. That said she was like go ahead and try it it cant hurt. Her reasoning being that plenty of religions impose fasts of one type or another without detriment as long as you drink enough water.So Im trying this intermittent fasting thing for a month or two. Im a few weeks in and I was feeling absolutely wrecked when I started. I dont feel better I still have very little energy to spend. But I definitely feel less bad. While I felt like I had a super severe stomach flu when I started I now just feel low on energy. I also dont feel as ill after overdoing it on chores.Since my feeling better normally means an increase in energy which Im lacking at this moment Im inclined to think the fasting might be doing something for me. But it still might be coincidence or even placebo who knows?P.S I made no changes in my diet. The current one is the same as its been for  months. Im on  kcal daily to lose weight and eat whatever I feel likecapable of making with dinner usually being my biggest meal of the day. When I feel incapable of making dinner I order in pizza or kebab.,cfs,cuah8zb,1,t5_2r4lw

Turns out the Dr didnt check for atypical lymphocytes or there were none which need to show along with a monospot for a positive diagnosis.

6998394,0,t1_d16cobf,I have had CFS for  years and have also been diagnosed with a genetic mitochondrial disease. I am not a scientist so this is going to be a very rudimentary explanation. Genetic mutations can occur several ways only one is through heritability. Our cells are all constantly replacing themselves. When they are being replaced they rely on the recorded DNA instructions to know what cell to become. The DNA itself gets copied from one cell to the next. In this process a mistake in copying can occur causing a spontaneous genetic mutation.Spontaneous genetic mutations can absolutely happen in the mitichondria. Mitochondria perform a range of different functions as someone else pointed out. It is unknown whether the mutations that cause adult onset mitochondrial diseases have been inherited or are from mistakes in copying or both. One theory is that the mitochondrial disease may be present from birth but not faulty enough to cause a major problem in infancy and severe symptoms may be kicked off by some other physical or environmental factor that exposes the weakness and creates more severe dysfunction. The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation statesgtCan adults have Mitochondrial Disease?gtYes many adults are diagnosed with adultonset mitochondrial disease.  Some of these individuals have been ill their whole lives but went undiagnosed.  Others have carried the genetic mutation that causes mitochondrial disease since birth but did not show any symptoms until a severe illness brought them on.  Adult mitochondrial patients are affected in a similar manner to the children who are affected.Mitochondrial Diseases can cause damage to multiple body systems and the symptoms of different diseases can absolutely align with MECFS. In fact the multiple body systems involvement in CFS is a good indicator that there is a systemic energy production problem which could very easily relate to mitochondrial dysfunction.,cfs,d19m0vx,2,t5_2r4lw

8680459,0,t3_4ydfz1,undoubtedly it was one of the first symptoms   leg muscles felt heavy and unresponsive while walking  rather than springy  light  energetic   it seemed to vary somewhat over time  days . I also breath faster than normal at times when not completely in a rest state  suggesting some sort of inefficiency at processing oxygen  I dont smoke . I have enough energy and a basic understanding to interpret what this is saying      Interestingly evidence exists to suggest the role of central impairment in CFSME patients. For example Whiteside and colleagues  reported CFSME patients to exhibit a dysfunction of nociceptive inhibition during exercise This basically means that you are more sensitive to pain etc under certain conditions and you might feel slightly more tired not particularly important.   Effectively oxidative and nitrosative stress involve the enhanced production of ROS and reactive nitrogen species RNS in addition to other free radicals these reactive species have the potential to disrupt cell membrane function through lipid peroxidation as well as damage to functional proteins and DNA. This can ultimately lead to alterations in cell structure and disease initiating mutations   This is pretty bad you dont want this really    its certain chemicals that are unstable or volatile that sort of react with anything they touch and ruin it   sort of like if you tipped concentrated acid onto something   normally small amounts of this would naturally occur and the body deals with it somehow    this seems to be saying that greater quantities of this reactive chemicals is being produced by our cells for some reason.    Elevated ROSRNS exhibit the capacity to profoundly impair mitochondrial function which has been suggested to be due to the accumulation of oxidative modified mitochondrial proteins lipids and DNA   It breaks stuff   things which were already not working correctly are made worse    Furthermore CFSME patients also exhibited marked alterations in muscle membrane excitability indicated by lengthened Mwave duration during the recovery period .   They tested peoples muscle response with electric shock machines and found that different readouts were produced for CFS people   a pivotal finding of the more recent study  was that ICFSME patients exhibited significant accentuation of blood oxidant status at rest in addition to muscle hypoexcitability at work  If your cfs started by a major infection e.g. EBV  it could explain why your symptoms are different to other peoples    excessive oxidative and nitrosative stress has also been suggested to be associated with secondary autoimmune responses. Prolonged oxidative and nitrosative stress may cause damage to protein and lipid structures to such an extent that they lose immunogenic tolerance and autoantibodies begin to be formed against them  This part I find really interesting   remember I said that ROS ruins stuff that it touches ?   well it seems that this would include certain nutrients that are in the body like lipid chains   producing a sort of alternate version   this new chemical isnt meant to be in the body  so when the immune system detects it its not on the list of allowed substances and it does not like it   so say these nutrients find their way into cells  they then present this chemical to the patrolling T cells or what not  and the T cell then decides to attack that cell just because it contains that unwanted material    not entirely sure on the specifics of this though      If this is true then it could mean that the immune system isnt the original source of the disease   its just reacting in response to abnormal conditions arising from dysfunction in normal body cells  ,cfs,d6qojmy,2,t5_2r4lw

I think there are multiple pathways to fatigue so the key phrase is some people might benefit from any particular treatment and others may not.Any time you bring up links or overlaps between CFS and depression you run the risk that someone will make CFS out to be psychosomatic or secondary to mental illness which ultimately hurts the cause IMO. Its not surprising that arthritis patients feel less depressed when their inflammation is reduced I would be surprised if they didnt.,cfs,d71wm5g,1,t5_2r4lw

Not sure if its the same cream youre talking about or not. Had to be specially ordered and made up on the spot by a specific chemist. She said it generally has very good results in most of her patients but that time frames vary. She didnt mention relapses though. The CFS diagnosis was a similar process. Useless Dr Good Dr My own Dr and then a specialist in a public hospital. The only issue with him was that he didnt explain the significance of having abnormal complement factors in my blood.
