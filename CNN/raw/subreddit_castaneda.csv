8247830,0,t1_d57ekv6,From what I understand store energy by not wasting it.  This passage from Fire From Within explains something interesting about a humans energyI have always told you that sexual energy is something of ultimate importance and that it has to be controlled and used with great care. But you have always resented what I said because you thought I was speaking of control in terms of moralityI always meant it in terms of saving and rechanneling energy. ...It is the Eagles command that sexual energy be used for creating life. Through sexual energy the eagle bestows awareness. So when sentient beings are engaged in sexual intercourse the emanations inside their cocoons do their best to bestow awareness to the new sentient being they are creating. He said that during the sexual act the emanations encased inside the cocoon of both partners undergo a profound agitation the culminating point of which is a merging a fusing of two pieces of the glow of awareness one from each partner that separate from their cocoons. Sexual intercourse is always a bestowal of awareness even though the bestowal may not be consolidated he went on. The emanations inside the cocoon of human beings dont know of intercourse for fun. ... All I know is what it means to warriors. They know that the only real energy we possess is a life bestowing sexual energy. This knowledge makes them permanently conscious of their responsibility. If warriors want to have enough energy to see they must become misers with their sexual energy.,castaneda,d58j8yr,2,t5_2sblm
