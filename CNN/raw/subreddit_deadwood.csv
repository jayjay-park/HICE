4446351,0,t3_3bzvl5,Oh man there are literally dozens upon dozens from this show. Some funny as hell and some poignant and thought provoking. It absolutely has the best dialogue of any show Ive ever seen.Ill go with he wants me to tell him something pretty because thats not a popular choice but yet it really resonates with me given the circumstances and that its the last line of the show.,deadwood,csr5d7b,2,t5_2ru33
4818301,0,t3_3gtydq,Story time. When I was  I served a mission for the LDS church. I lived in England for two years completely separated from pop culture movies television etc. I have since left the church since it doesnt match my lifestyle at all but thats besides the point. When I got home I went to college and started catching up on great shows that I had missed out on. One of them was Deadwood. I instantly fell in love with the show. It became my favorite along with The Wire. It has retained that spot to this day even over other great shows like Mad Men Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. I was watching the show by torrenting the episodes one season at a time. Heres the kicker. For some reason I thought there was four seasons. I was certain that there was four seasons. I watched the third season and loved it but I was dying to know what happened next. I immediately hopped on to kat.ph to search for the season  torrents. I couldnt find them anywhere. Finally I went on to IMDB and realized that Im a fucking idiot and that the show got cancelled after the third season. Holy shit I was furious. It honestly still bothers me. If this is true and Deadwood comes back Ill sacrifice a goat to say thanks. ,deadwood,cu1vx2n,3,t5_2ru33

5831848,0,t3_3v1ifk,The first one honestly. I was stoned as bejezus I couldnt understand a single word anyone was saying and I had no idea what was going on. But I loved it.It was a rainy day during a week long beach house vacation with a bunch of bros. Me and two other dudes ended up watching seven episodes or something ridiculous like that.,deadwood,cxk2yne,2,t5_2ru33
6365905,0,t1_czbvo7e,Holy shit this so unbelievably ridiculous Id be amazed if it was intentional but its so unbelievably hilarious that I choose to believe it is.,deadwood,czd8enp,1,t5_2ru33
7927322,0,t3_4dtxg9,One of the best tricks of Deadwood is that for a full season it kind of tricks you into thinking Sweringen is the bad guy because youre coming into the middle of his machinations. Yes he is duping the NY dude but thats a purely financial enterprise he doesnt entertain murder until he is threatened with the Pinkertons who with historical context would have rained down absolute destruction on the entire town in order to fuck him. His plot to murder the Squarehead girl is kind of just him being backed into a corner. The slaughter of her family was done behind his back but it was done by his own men. He would never get his neck out of the noose if she had talked. The genius of his character is that he climbs his way out of the perception your given him in episode one and by season two you realize he is more interested in running his own business and eventually protecting the town. Its fucking Tolliver that is pure evil. ,deadwood,d473tbb,1,t5_2ru33
8268159,0,t1_d5ar1r2,For the purposes of this game Im classifying supporting characters as those whose actor counterparts are not credited in the main titles. I didnt want to make distinctions between who is plot integral and who is not. That felt too subjective. So this means Francis Wolcott and George Hearst are contenders in the game but little Sofia and William are not. Yeah its weird but its not supposed to be science. Its supposed to be fun. Im also not telling anyone how to vote. Vote for the plot integral character or vote for the character you find the funniest or the nicest. Its entirely up to you. Hawkeye is more plot integral but Im voting for the Irish guy that works for Farnum because the idea of him getting drunk shitting his pants and burying his pants under rocksmultiple timesis too absurdly funny. Im sure Richardson will reign supreme but then Ive heard rumors of a large Tittylicker contingent... ,deadwood,d5b2tas,1,t5_2ru33
8355515,0,t1_d5lvylo,Also makes a great appearance in Oh Brother Where Art Thou. Strongly suggest watching if you havent seen. Not just because the reverend is in it he doesnt even have a big role but just because its awesome and I try to tell people to watch it whenever I can ,deadwood,d5lzqa6,2,t5_2ru33

8599972,0,t1_d6gkphh,Well Tbh I could hardly grasp the dialogue to truely understand what was all going down throughout the seasons.  Im not that smart lol and you know how they talk In deadwood.  That being said I kinda came into it biased against Olyphant always thought he was kind of a cheesy actor.   But its kinda like how roro said all that kinda made me like his character.  And when you kinda get to understanding who Bullock is all his actions and reactions are kinda justified  lol no pun intended,deadwood,d6gl8bd,4,t5_2ru33
8600242,0,t1_d6gl8bd,I didnt really have a problem with his actions or had trouble following his motivation his deliveryacting just seemed offincongruent with the story,deadwood,d6gmg6j,0,t5_2ru33
8772256,0,t3_506g62,Bravo for Deadwood getting some love. Too bad HBO showed it none when it mattered.Best of lists are the original clickbait. They serve a minor and somewhat entertaining purpose but are most often musings pulled out of someones butt.As for this one? No exception though it tries to attach a pseudosystematic measured logic to its musings. As for the shows themselves? Im going to go way out on a reddit limb here The Wire isnt even the best David Simon TV show. That would be Homicide Life on the Street.,deadwood,d727591,1,t5_2ru33
