4017216,0,t3_36emds,Basically there is no legendary soviet design keyset out there. I already thougt of this. The problem is to hit the right colors as red and gold are iconical colors. The hardest is to match the right red color as some red colors have negative effects on people. There are some dark crimson colors whose bring the blood to boil just by looking at it. I got a red color in my head which i would prefer for this set. Try RAS RDD RCQ  and RN out one of these colors is what you need. For gold i would take YBP for example. There is one color missing and it must be an light color so you can calm down these intense colors i already counted. Just try them out in different postitions and combinations. Something like this ,keycapdesigners,cre6yjg,1,t5_389nj

4817069,0,t1_cu1jg69,Thanks  thats pretty much what Ive heard from everyone Ive talked to.Were currently talking with Signature Plastics about what they can do so some changes are coming. Im almost sure the profile will switch to SA but other changes are more up in the air. Trans yellow polycarbonate keycaps are also planned but it depends on how close their colors are to the legos. Ill update the post when the changes are ready but most of the discussion is taking place on the interest check page on GeekHack at this point. Stay tuned!,keycapdesigners,cu1qbp7,1,t5_389nj

6249334,0,t3_40edbn,I was wondering the same thing. I want to keep my double shot design as cheap as I can but design a few of the onesi dont like. But I dont want to unintentionally have all the legends so slightly different that it would be custom and cost for a new legend mold,keycapdesigners,cyzzcwh,1,t5_389nj
