4872798,0,t3_3hlj6g,gt If the system is riggedIf the system is rigged then theres no way Bernie can win. He doesnt have a super PAC hes not cozying up to big donors in fact hes actively fighting against the moneyed interests in Washington. If its really true that the system is rigged then its impossible for Bernie to win.So Im not sure why Lessig is arguing contradictory points? If he really thinks the system is rigged why is he spending all his time trying to drag Bernie down? There would be no need to do that just let the super PACs do it for him and he could focus on talking about the issues..... but if Bernie does win what does that mean? It either means that the system isnt actually rigged or it means that in the process of winning Bernie wouldve have broken the system.gt Do we really imagine millions of people occupying Washington?Apparently Lessig doesnt think that getting a candidate elected without big money is a revolution? That openly defying big money and winning with the support of the average american wouldnt be important? Its something thats never been done in my lifetime. Its something that no has actually tried to do and had a chance of succeeding.Lessig complains that we arent thinking big enough but Bernies campaign is the biggest change to happen in US politics in  years at least. Hes the first politician to actively and honestly fight for the average american against the big money players that are trying to corrupt the process. And hes the first candidate who has a chance to win and is making campaign finance reform a cornerstone of their campaign.,Lessig2016,cu8r5h9,1,t5_39hni

5286453,0,t1_cvndvnr,Yeah thats still not being allowed on the track. There have been more than  polls.From that same article you quoted And other secondtier candidates have registered zero percent in many polls meaning they had less than  percent support. But they have been included in every recent survey allowing them to catch  percent here and  percent there giving them enough of a cushion to qualify for the debate stage.And Lessig argues that if his name showed up in all nine surveys in the field since he entered the race he would have met CNNs threshold.,Lessig2016,cvnen79,-1,t5_39hni

Im not interested in hearing your results much less your cheeky mockerywith the possible exception of extremely clever mockery.Oh how I love the Texas Tribune.,Lessig2016,cw3rxj2,4,t5_39hni

5571860,0,t3_3rexkc,Although people often bemoan the feeling of picking between the lesser of two evils I dont think that will ever stop me from voting. Life isnt perfect you wont always agree  with any given candidate but supporting someone you favor even by the slightest margin is in my view better than doing nothing. If you literally cant find yourself leaning one way or the other for as different as the two major parties are in a lot of areas sure we can all get together and say theyre both captured by the system etc. but their platforms and ideals are very different by the slightest margin then I guess you get a pass but otherwise I think exercising some pragmatism is the way to go. Not meant to be a direct affront to you or anyone else its just a peeve of mine. Pardon my high horse.Hopefully the day will come where you dont feel like you have to compromise your values to have a meaningful vote and the state you live in wont determine your president electing worth because there are certainly millions of people in the country who feel the same way you do.,Lessig2016,cwnqo8n,2,t5_39hni

Ten star gold threads all over the place Started to get a little sad as time went on and then straight up narcissistically evil once he embarrassed himself on Realtime and declared hed be a much shittier version of Bernie Sanders instead.Is it really too much to ask to settle for publicly financed elections via the guy who has a  chance to beat Hillary?,Lessig2016,cwq9v75,1,t5_39hni
