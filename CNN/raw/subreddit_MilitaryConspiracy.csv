10814184,0,t3_5unoc4,As a military conspiracy I am very concerned about these becoming F starfighters. Basically you could build these on the cheap and they would be effective first class space target hunters reusable and probably expendable i.e. cheap. Able to loiter over any area and in seconds navigate an entire field of command of any given area. These things are probably able to penetrate a large area effectively and surprisingly stealthy to some degree due to there small size.I am guessing you could probably load whatever ordinance you wanted onto a X as it carries a load approximate in size to that of a bed on a pick up truck. wtf very scary shit to weaponize space.,MilitaryConspiracy,ddvenog,1,t5_2v8hj
