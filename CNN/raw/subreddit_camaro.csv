The car always runs at a good temp Ive never had a problem with it overheating.The reason I wonder about the timing is that the guy I bought it from said that he had retarded the timing a bit before I drove the car home.  He said it would get better fuel mileage that way. ?

597601,0,t3_20yziz,I will say Im a huge fan of OnStar. Not so much of the dealer I bought my car from. Heres whyAfter I bought my car at  miles I broke an axle. I was close to the dealership the ended up replacing the rear end and right axle as well. Winter in the north is a pain so the car was put away in storage till that spring. I got it out drove for awhile then decided to give a launch another try. Broke the right axle at  miles. This time however I was  miles from homevisiting my folks. It was a Saturday and Chevrolet Roadside only pays for a tow to the closest dealer which was only  miles away but still  from home. So I called the dealership which I bought the car from. I got the big old FU from them as they wouldnt do anything to help get me home. OnStar on the other handI was still in trial call for the cab and paid for it to take me the  miles home. In my mind they went above and beyond to help me when I was stranded. I will forever because of their customer service be an advocate for them. Plus I like using the app to check how many gallons the car says it has left as well as the per trip estimated MPG. Edit grammar and on the app I also like the remote door lockunlock and if I had it remote start from anywhere,camaro,cg878om,2,t5_2s44r

Street tires are hard and make for road handling and lasting for thousands of miles. Unfortunately the only way to even begin to hook even at a prepped track is to run a drag radial like the Nitto R.Until then practice feathering the throttle out of the launch.

Not very streetable in my opinion. Magnaflows would sound decent and would keep the exhaust exiting out of the rear which will help kill drone issues.Exhaust always boils down to opinion. Some do flow better than others but how much drone and rasp are you willing to accept to gain more hp?,camaro,cmsdxjp,1,t5_2s44r

And cars of all types modded unmodded common rare fast slow ridiculous plain notchy etc etc. By your train of thought I cant take my  Z to a car show just because it is bone stock.

8581611,0,t3_4uk2my,Im a bit late to the party but heres my two cents... The LT LE will be a hell of a car but keep in mind that its a track focused vehicle. If youre just trying to get back and forth from work in style then you really dont need what the LE offers. For the cost of the LT LE you could just get a LT and have a much more loaded out car comfortwise. For somebody whos a new buyer looking to get into the auto world I would say get a base LT. The lower cost will keep your disposable income intact and that money can go towards new mods for you car which you will be doing yourself. Youll make mistakes but youll learn a ton. And thats the best way to get started into all this. And real car enthusiasts love cars regardless of their makemodelengine displacement.

Its low quality so you cant make out the plates. They drove up one street hitting random cars. Tagged  or  cars in my apartment complex. Also threw a brick through someones windshield. Hit another apartment complex around the corner. And then got one more street. They painted clowns and smiley faces. ,camaro,dfe2m3f,4,t5_2s44r
