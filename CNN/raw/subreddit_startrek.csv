4528,0,t3_1u5k1q,Im excited CBS decided to take up the legacy once again its about dang time and the premises for the medically based show sounds interesting but there are a lot of possibilities for this to be a bastardized version of the purity that Roddenberry originally envisioned for the series. Plus the idea of a Jump warp is cheating in my opinion. A majority of the interest of the show comes from the limitations of the technology ex. the entire VOY series. If Chekov and Sulu are going to be in this show as rumored and their era was much before VOY isnt there an opportunity for interference with the plots of other series? Other than that this seems to be looking inward instead of outward as the other series always have.I am very skeptical about this new series but I will in no means pigeon hole it before I have even seen it. Until then I await the pilots.,startrek,ceeyb89,2,t5_2qixm

It deviates from the formula and for some reason people consider that a bad thing. Do you know the reason doctor who has been on for so long? Change. It changes every two or three seasons. It constantly deviates from the formula and that keeps people interested. Do you know why we havent had a new trek show in so long?

258286,0,t3_1x0uj5,The TOS episode Patterns of Force had such a strong and obvious connection to Germanys past that it was not shown on German television when the show first aired in its dubbed version in the s. They thaught it might be too hard to swallow for the German audience. The episode was finally dubbed and shown in Germany for the  premiere of the remastered series.To put this in a context one should know that on German television in the s the show was aimed at a younger audience thus some episodes were actually recut and dubbed with changed dialogue. One such episode was Amok Time which has strong sexual references. Most of this was remedied for the remastered version in .,startrek,cf7j111,2,t5_2qixm

I think with the war ENT did shift the format a bit but they couldnt break from it the episode with the Old West planet for example.DS has always been my favorite but the premise of the show necessitated a different format they stay in one place generally speaking because the premise demanded it.I think your format could work nicely with a good idea that matches it. I really do. But to shoehorn an idea into it might feel clunky. Keep at it  think up a show idea and outline a few episodes with the format. See if it works.

383285,0,t1_cfk5jik,As somebody who started watching Star Trek in  and actually saw and liked as I still do the first reboot movie before watching any of the TOS films I believe this goes way beyond nostalgia.In terms of motive Khan really wasnt much better than Nero and in terms of actual problemsolving Wrath of Khan is quite weak. However I found that Montalban came off a veritable fountain of charisma whereas Cumberbatch mostly seemed to be channeling his inner Gollum. To put it in fairer terms Cumberbatch was a grittier and more realistic criminal whereas Montalban was an operatic largerthanlife antagonist and I usually find the latter much more appealing.However I think the main difference I see between the two movies and this extends to the characters is a sign of the times The pacing. The Wrath of Khan is actionoriented sure but the action feels more like padding around the dialogue scenes which play to TOS greatest strength The chemistry between the characters. Indeed if you took Khan out of the movie all together youd still have a fairly enjoyable character drama.Nevertheless the action provides a good backdrop for the discussions about aging death and the nowin scenario and it intensifies very elegantly over time and builds up to an incredibly satisfying climax.In Star Trek Into Darkness I feel that dialogue and action have had their roles reversed The dialogue is now padding for the action which is the main attraction. Scotty has a great part to play but apart from that I feel like most of the characters are thrown out the window apart from the very disappointing discussion about Spock and Uhuras relationship I sort of feel like the characters didnt even need to be there they could have been replaced with just about any ragtag team of adventurers.This is also why they need a Khan who is more of a super villain rather than just a wellread madman with a ship he is the impetus for action not drama. And as with most action films these days STID blows its load too early on and drags the ending out for five hours too long.In short I like Montalbans performance more than Cumberbatchs but they are both heavily influenced by the movie theyre part of. Its sometimes commented that Frank Langella gave one hell of a performance as Skeletor in The Masters of the Universe but few people notice it because the movie is such a brainless trainwreck that brings shame over the film industry.,startrek,cfkhqtg,7,t5_2qixm

With the exception of the wormhole there is little strategic value in DS. Although is later episodes they risk a lot to retake it its possible that the strategic significance has changed.  Ie other star bases that they used as rendezvous points and repair have been distroyed.With the mines in place and the station sabotaged it was an acceptable risk to leave the station and give up the sector as the resources required to hold the station were deemed not to be worth it.

Moore raised the excellent point in his critique of Voyagers treatment of her character when he argued that there is nothing wrong with sexuality in Star Trek but that unfortunately it seems that women are more often sexualized than men.So her costume really sticks in peoples craws as cynical fanservice pushed on her character by network execs chasing ratings. Its interesting to note that both Seven and TPol probably the most sexualized main characters in Trek were in series that were produced for network television rather than for syndication.

Probably because one of the reasons to love Trek is the attempt at being based on real science which this episode pooped on. Obviously Trek writers invent tons of fake science but rarely do they intentionally contradict real science. They even went out of their way to include Heisenberg compensators on the transporters.After a decent track record it is understandable why some people were offended by an episode about deevolution... though at the time of writing science did think that introns were leftover junk DNA and so the episode is far more forgivable than Voyagers Threshold where two individuals evolved to the future state of mankind which was apparently predetermined by evolution to be a giant newt.,startrek,cgadzew,7,t5_2qixm

She may have even done it before then....   shes understandably tentative about being Q but her statement seemed... odd if she was really bringing them back to life from death as whole beings.Also her parents were Q so there is some issue there as to what death and resurrection as a Q means and what it means for random humans.Im not sure they can bring people back from whenever at least not in  an ultimate sense that it is  them.

The moment you address it you give it more weight than it needs.Theres a reason that no explanation is given for the device that allows Worf to control Quarks movements in Looking for parMach in All the Wrong Places because how something works is far far less important than the role it plays in the story.Scottys line in Relics is so trivial so momentary that it doesnt need to be explained away.

642656,0,t3_21hbe1,It all also lines up with the broader allegory of the FederationKlingonRomulan triad established in TOS based in s geopolitics and then allowed to progress and develop on its own from there onward.In TOS however the FederationKlingon conflict was in many ways supposed to serve as an allegory for the Cold War with the Romulans playing the role of China. In terms of their early partnership and uneasy coventures it very much mirrors the rapidly evaporated alliance between the USSR and China which started in  barely lasted through the s and then deteriorated into a number of shooting conflicts and proxy wars in the s and s people tend to group the USSR and China into one Communist bloc glossing over that Mao and Stalin hated each other and the USSR and PRC had very different conceptions of Communist ideology and statecraft. But I digress. This allegorical relationship loses much of its staying power once TNG starts up given the changing dynamics of the Federation Klingons and Romulans but it accounts for some of the original dynamics. More broadly though given the precarious footing of the Klingon Empire itself by the TNG era desperate times call for desperate measures.,startrek,cgdbjsm,1,t5_2qixm

The point is WoK and UC are generally well regarded amongst the majority of Trek fans whereas the new films arent. While the reasons for this are debatable clearly there is something that more Trek fans like in those older films that wasnt captured in the new ones.

929455,0,t1_ch9xk2e,How is that more content? I am saying to not allow memes and merch pics which are currently allowed. That would technically be less content. Allowing other kinds of images to be directly linked wouldnt be more content as much as it would be more active users and more visible content. I am looking at the front page. The third and fifth posts are images. They just dont get the same visibility of other types of link posts videos tweets and articles because self posts dont get a lot of views. If your argument is that the  percent of readers this sub lost is a good thing because you want a smaller sub with less people on it then you should say that. Thats a valid opinion. Its not an opinion that I would agree with. I think rstartrek as the main Trek sub should grow the brands visibility on Reddit and be inclusive as rdoctorwho is for their show and as rstarwars is for theirs. Let it be a hub for the smaller discussion based Trek subs and the meme based Trek subs. Why kill the sub just to make it smaller? Why not just go to a smaller sub?Saying that allowing image posts sans memes and merch is going to lead to more content directly isnt the case since all images are currently allowed. What it will lead to is higher visibility of the sub and perhaps the return of the thousands of people who no longer see this sub or go out of their way to visit it. That indirectly will lead to more content as well as more of everything else. ,startrek,ch9xm7q,1,t5_2qixm

1058179,0,t1_chojkdb,Its absolutely true that Janeways character was flipfloppy because of poor writing which victimizes the entire crew and the show as a whole. I could never get into that show despite multiple attempts because of the inconsistency and the feeling that it was written down to a lessintelligent audience vs. TNG and DS which were always much more intellectual and thoughtinspiring. Picard is pretty consistent throughout although some of his decisions contradict other ones  his treatment of the Native Americans and of Wesley Crusher in Journeys End being probably the most glaring example. He doesnt grow much throughout the show oddly even though it seemed at the beginning that he was given the most rough edges to be smoothed out.Sisko is definitely one of the best characters in the history of Trek. Right from the characters conception he got the best possibility for growth. A normal man who suddenly becomes a religious icon to an entire people all while juggling Starfleet duties single fatherhood and then an interstellar war? Thats beyond operatic in scope and equal credit belongs to Avery Brooks for delivering an amazing and extremely multifaceted if sometimes overthetop performance worthy of the material. Even Archer comes a long way in his time its a shame Voyager didnt give the same opportunity to Janeway and Kate Mulgrew. Probably the greatest travesty of Voyager is that it had the most potential  you want brave new worlds and new civilizations?

1104011,0,t3_26rh43,I have watched every episode of most of the Star Treks minus ToS several times. I actually like Voyager the best and I dont think it should change.   It is probably a little dated for  but comparable with TNG in terms of style.Why would I like Voyager over TNG or others?  Well the concept.  They are really lost in deep space.  And there is that long running arc with the mission to return home.  TNG never really had a long running arc except the Romulan war or the occasional borg encounter.  There were a couple of episodes like The Void that really solidified a Star Trek episode.  Here is Voyager completely left on their own with no contact with any ship.  How will they survive?  Will they ever get home?  How do they trade or interact with other species.On your post my only comment is about the Maquis.  It seemed pointless to further the Maquis story line because you figure eventually everyone is going to have to work together to survive.  I thought the whole Maquis angle was kind of pointless and they pretty much dropped talking about it after the first couple of seasons.  Once Seska was gone they all but stopped talking about it.,startrek,chts6nm,8,t5_2qixm
1104435,0,t1_chtovji,In the very first episode of DS someone throws a mace at Odos face which just passes through it.Odo seems to limit himself when fighting a lot. He could just grow huge tentacles and take on  men at once. Its been established that hes basically superman in one episode the entire DS staff working together could not catch him. If Odo wanted to take over the station he could do so. Things we know about changelings Can survive in the vacuum of space Laas was shown flying in space Can fly simply by transforming into something that can fly Odo did this many times Are either biologically immortal or very longlived One of the Founders comments to Odo implies that changelings do not die of old age. Have strength that far exceeds any humanoid Odo is seen doing things like stopping a lift thats out of control and has no problem taking on seemingly anyone he chooses. Are very resistant to beam weapons. It took like  disruptors continued fire to kill the Martok Changeling who didnt feel like limiting itself like Odo when it fought and just grew tentacles. Can travel at very high speeds in liquid form. The Kazinsky changeling that took over the Defiant was frequently seen escaping at rapid speed before people could react.So yeah Odo is basically supermanEdit Then again there are inconsistencies to this this portrayal Odo has been knocked out by a blow to the head like in Vortix with rocks falling on him. Odo does not actually have a brain and has been shown to be able to sustain considerable physical punishment without any ill effects. Bashir once stated that Odo has no internal organs comparable to any humanoid structure when he takes humanoid form and his internals are simply a homogeneous solid substance which has a completely identical density throughout him. In Treachery Faith and the Great River Odo strongly implies that he can die from cold and lack of oxygen. Laas has been shown to be able to survive in space and Odo himself was found adrift in space. Its unclear why Odo would need oxygen or any temperature at all since he has no metabolism that requires oxygen to function nor does he have any enzymes that need to be at a particular temperature to operate. There have been various cases of Odo struggling to restrain someone. Odo himself implies that whatever organs shown on the outside are physical approximations and do not actually function. He has a nose but he does not need oxygen and cannot smell they could test for changelings by just asking them what something smells like? but he has time and time demonstrated that he can be snuck up from behind and clearly needs to turn his head to see certain things and even look around corners with his head while he could grow an eyeball from his hand if he wanted to. When hes in the form of a barrel its implied he can see omnidirectionally around him so why not as a humanoid? His combadge is it part of him or not? Maybe he just absorbs it into his body when he changes who knows.,startrek,chttx8u,2,t5_2qixm

1123799,0,t1_chw0jfe,For a monster episode The Man Trap wasnt actually all that bad. For a junior high kid watching those tentacles wrap themselves around Kirks head as he screams in agony was really great stuff! I think NBC had their demographic figured out pretty well when they decided to do a switch with Where No Man Has Gone Before. But it completely contradicted their media campaign.An occasional monster episode is fine but consider the revived Dr. Who every single week another monster for the Doctor to fight. At least thats what it was earlier I stopped watching after Tennant. It seems theres more acceptability of that today so Im a something fish out of water. I think the disappointment with The Man Trap was due more to media stories about how Star Trek was going to be an intelligent series and how it was getting cooperation from NASA. And you have to remember all this was before the first moon shot. It was an exciting time to watch Project Mercury become Project Gemini then become Project Apollo. It was possible for a kid back then to tell his father while he was driving that the speed limit had changed from Warp Factor  to Warp Factor  from  mph to  mph. I remember the day after Return of the Archons in the schoolyard a gradually increasing group of us going around interrogating kids Are you of the Body? and woe to those who werent. Interestingly though most had actually seen the episode the previous night and understood the gag and we really did get responses like Peace and tranquillity be unto you until our principal noticed something going on and suspecting some sort of sedition ordered us all inside.TNG was something that I really looked forward to seeing. It wasnt a bad show and as you mention it tried  especially at the beginning  to be a continuation of the series in another form. I conceptualized it as being something along the lines of MASH which was supposed to be about the earlier US action in Korea but which everybody knew was really about the Vietnam War. So I regarded TNG as being replacement Star Trek just with new characters and a yearlater date to account for actual technological improvements since the airing of TOS. I was hoping they would adapt from the wealth of science fiction writing some of the stories just as TOS had. But its my feeling that they had ordinary scriptwriters who really couldnt get into the material not specialists like D.C. Fontana and others who could and did adapt some pretty serious SF. In TOS Kirk must decide whether his love for Edith Keeler is more important than saving the Earth from the onslaught of naziism. In one episode of TNG Picard must rescue an awayteam crewmember who has committed the death penalty offence of stepping on the lawn! Talk about a case of the first time as tragedy the second as farce.,startrek,chw1bg3,1,t5_2qixm

I dont recall it being seen as at all out of the ordinary that Khan beamed directly to the Klingon homeworld. That tech is part of Trek now.Third the blood cured a disease and resurrected a dead Tribble and human killed by radiation. It didnt just cure radiation poisoning. This is the future and medical science can easily replicate that blood and more than likely they can do all kinds of stuff with its ability to revitalize dead cells so efficiently that people can be revived soon after death. Its the kind of technology that should change all of medicine. It wont because itll be inconvenient to the writers.These are the kinds of plot holes that killed the tv show Heroes which starred Zachary QuintoSpock among others where characters got way too powerful too fast because it sounded cool when written. Then characters with powers that shouldve been brought in to deal with different situations were conveniently forgottennot mentioned.

1289387,0,t3_28ix9x,Final Frontier was the closest thing to the Original Series as the movies ever got. But because it follows the Genesis trilogy which was excellent exciting and occasionally quite deep a return to more the campy pseudosciencey aspects of TOS feel really like a let down. There are also a couple of GROSS continuity errors and a couple of character assassinations ahem Scotty ahem in the name of humor. It still has some incredible moments however. The entire first act until the crew gets underway on their adventure is actually amazing character development and very heartfelt. Kirk Spock and McCoy sitting around a campfire really brings back the triumvirate from TOS in a great way. Some of Shatners best acting as James T. The rest of the movie is significantly less well done although there is some great acting from Nimoy and Kelley about s through. My suggestion watch it with an open mind and try to appreciate the several excellent moments in it... but just be aware it also has terrible flaws that make it the worst of the TOS movies. Undiscovered Country is fucking excellent and superior to the Genesis trilogy but I dont think that is a very common opinion. Have fun! ,startrek,cieo858,1,t5_2qixm

Never mentioned again nor does the whole experience seem to leave any kind of impression on him.

1548189,0,t3_2bxhgv,Human. Or Klingon Federation OfficerThe utopian future that the Federation enjoys seems very limited to the Federation.  No other race seems to enjoy the clean lawful nomoney economy pursuit of dreams and art and passions  like the federation does.Heck most races are jokes that can be boiled down to a single hyperexaggerated stereotype trait.  The Klingons are tough and warful and  their society is a nightmare of self preservation constant danger and early death. While the Vulcans are federation species they are so scientific and logical that they seem disconnected from anything that could be considered joyful.  Emotions may have some problems but happiness and joy are imo worth exploring.  They shut themselves down to be better and that doesnt sound fun.  Though i will say they are probably a close second for races as their economy and environment seem pretty good.Ferengi is this even a legitimate option?  I mean these guys are capitalist to a comical degree.  They are so capitalistically motivated that they backstab and betray even their own kind in order make more money.  The ONLY benefit I can see from being Ferengi is that if youre a male with some success you can probably lead a pretty perverted and wild lifestyle.Kardassians are just like Romulans as far as Im concerned.  A pain in the ass bad attitude race that has basically been injected into the series because they spent so much time reforming Klingons that they needed a new general enemy.  The Romulans I dont know a ton about from a lifestyle perspective but they seem sneaky untrustworthy and quagmired in mistrust and political posturing I have a hard time believing that would be a good culture to be a part of.  The Kardassians are no better in fact they are worse becasue their ongoing war with both Beojor and the Federation seems to have no substance or legitimacy.  Plus their uniforms are drab black and Kim Kardashian is a bitch though she has a GREAT body Bejorans are in dead last place.  What a worthless piece of shit race they are.  They sit around worshipping and being a theocracy that DS shows us is COMPLETELY corrupt and totally broken.  Evil dominates and the citizen population is held back by their religious zealotry.  I would rather be a mother fucking monkey on earth than a good for nothing Bejoran.  So Id be human.  Id enjoy earth which seems like a paradise.  If I could get through Star Fleet youd bet your ass Id try.  Id have to diet and exercise a lot to stay looking good in that uniform but itd be worth it.  If not then Id try to build a holodeck in my house.If I get to pick my life path set my destiny rather than just live as a normal member of my race Id go Klingon to be the biggest and toughest in Star Fleet plus I imagine Klingon sex is pretty wild ,startrek,cjac7oj,-2,t5_2qixm
1549291,0,t1_cjaflmh,I gave you one example where they explicitly say that there are multiple timelines TNGParallels.Time travel is relative most time travel episodes are told from the perspective of the time traveler so from that persons perspective when they enter an alternate timeline it appears that things have changed and when they get back to their own timeline it appears things have changed back. That doesnt eliminate the alternate timeline only changes what parts of the multiverse the traveler is experiencing.Yesterdays Enterprise for example is mostly from the perspective of the Enterprise Cs crew with the exception of a few minutes at the start and end of the episode. We see the timeline they traveled to when they moved forward in time. When they return to the time theyre supposed to be in our perspective shifts back to the Enterprise Ds crew however there is still out there in the multiverse a group of Klingon captains celebrating the destruction of the Federations flagship in glorious battle.,startrek,cjah6pp,1,t5_2qixm

1567173,0,t3_2c6jf9,According to Michael Okuda warp levels are logarithmically more energy intensive than the previous oneTo read this chart the light blue line is TNG era and later for the average power vs. warp speed. Keep in mind that the right side scale shows power usage logarithmically.As a side note the white line shows the transitional thresholds which are the reason warp travel is mostly done at whole numbers. Theres an energy peak and valley at every warp level so each whole warp number was set at the valley.Think like what a cars gas mileage does when an automatic transmission changes gears. At mph a car might be in rd gear using more gas than at mph when it shifts in to th gear. Same basic concept of energy usage applies here too.tldr version warp  isnt just  more energy usage than warp .

1668878,0,t1_cjpheqv,gt That aside If I had a friend who only dated people of his or her own skin colour. Or even a friend who was white as hell but only came home with black women. I would indeed say This is the fourth one of the same minority skin colour now? Do you judge people on their skin colour?  That is kinda awful I am sorry but if someone came up to me and said Hey Mike you seem to only date white people are you judging people by their skin color? I would ask them why my personal taste in women has to lineup with some sort of misguided social justice standard.  Seriously I think we need to stop right here and understand the difference between personal agency and institutional racism.  For example does Siskos choice in relationships on the reflect some sort of clearly implied standard? Is every character on that show following that same standard and only dating inside their own race or species?   Since we know from other examples of relationships in the show that DSs writing staff did not hold everyone to some sort of date in your own racespecies! standard than we can clearly infer that Siskos choice in women was not a message from the writers to the audience about the writers racial tolerance.  Perhaps what I am saying here is that none of us really have some sort of checklist we keep around that helps us keep track of the ethnicityracecolor of the people we date there should never be a point where someone comes up to you and says Hey according to my records you have only dated whiteblackAsianetc people clearly you are judging them by color and thus you should mix it up next time.  To tell that to someone is to essentially take their own personal agency out of the equation in favor of your own view of social tolerance and that is not right at all.gtI dont see how Worf is a black klingon all klingons are black in the sense of skin colour. Im pretty sure Klingons do not have the same races as human beings. Even in their primitive TOS makeup they were basically shoepolished to be dark skinned.  Lets not dance around this Worf as a character represents racial tolerance and Michael Dorn had been doing the character enough by DS to really inject himself into the role and make Worf a more three dimensional character as such it is difficult to not see Michael Dorn when you see Worf he is not simply another Klingon character with brown facepaint and it comes through in his performance.gtWorf and TroiDax was an issue of different species not races and not an issue at all. Which is kind of interesting Jake is fine dating a bajoran as long as shes black...?  Actually this falls into the same area as Worf being black or not we can play the semantics game and say but Dax is not white she is a Trill! but that still does not change the fact that Terry Farrel is white and her character is clearly being played as white on the show.  The same can be said of Troi are you seriously going to dismiss the obvious interracial undertones there? Seriously?  gtIts not racist but its not exactly at the forefront of challenging racial issues as well.  So the writers need to make sure that every relationship that the main characters have is somehow challenging? That every character be some sort of Chuck Yeager like figure that challenges every social barrier just because?  We seem to be getting into the issue where we need to find the line between affirmative action like choices and quotas at what point do you just allow the writers to write compelling stories without telling them that X percent of story elements need to be socially challenging.  Just because Star trek has a reputation of challenging social norms does not mean that it does so  of the time to expect that to happen  of the time is to want a really contrived and needlessly heavy handed show that would get tiresome and boring really quick.        ,startrek,cjpiv52,0,t5_2qixm

1931195,0,t1_cklntda,gt The only question here is the energy supply. You said they basically have free energy  i dont remember if anyone ever said what energy source most of the federation uses. We know on the ships its antimatter. But was there ever any explanation as to where they get the antimatter?Warpcapable vessels use a matterantimatter engine but most energy in the Federation definitely comes from fusion reactors. While warp engines produce more energy as weve seen theyre quite volatile if theres a breach which makes use on planets or even on space stations prohibitively dangerous. Deep Space Nine for example has four operational fusion reactors to power the entire station. Because the fuel is a stable form of hydrogen and because the power generation is so efficient iirc very little hydrogen is needed to maintain very high power output the energy is tantamount to being free. I dont remember where they get antimatter whether its collected or somehow manufactured. Thats a good question. Im going to have to look into that because its an essential part of Star Trek technology. Plus its fun. ,startrek,cklw81z,2,t5_2qixm

Meanwhile billions of people have died because of the war with the Dominion...yea the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many is the message Insurrection gave me. Also the Baku hate technology but constantly use technology Big giant dam anyone? And just go along with Captain Picards plan of foiling the Sona..with technology. TGWTG put it eloquently Hey thanks for saving us with your technology by the way we hate technology!Furthermore the whole point of the movie is dumb as hell. Instead of wasting time trying to learn about the Baku why dont they just take the radiation and leave? The Sona hate them anyway and moving the Baku off the planet will be a death sentence so why bother learning about them? Just take the radiation and go home. Let Data stay on the Enterprise so it doesnt become a problem and enjoy your miracle radiation! By the way....SOMEONE has had to have come across this miracle radiation at SOME point. Why are we just NOW hearing of it?

1949465,0,t1_cko1bpu,gtAll that said how do you think a nonTrek fan or semiTrek fan feels when all he hears from core Trekkies is that this movie sucked and that movie sucked and I cant believe theyre destroying Kirk with this crap Into Darkness?Honestly? The same way I feel when I hear from hardcore Tolkien fans that the Hobbit movies are terrible. I may not like the Hobbit movies as much as the previous trilogy but theyre fun and I go see them because theyre fun. I dont have a decadeslong passion and fandom built around that particular collection so when Tolkien fanatics are furious about the movie because of their deep knowledge and love of the series it doesnt really affect me. Think about a franchise youre only casually interested in. Maybe its Harry Potter or James Bond or Star Wars or Shrek. How seriously would you really take hardcore fans complaining about them? How seriously did you take the outrage from Bong fans who hated Quantum of Solace? And really my personal complaints about Trek moviestv are largely going to be complaints that make sense to other big fans. When I say for example that B should have been whistling Pop Goes the Weasel at the end of Nemesis only people who get that Im referencing Encounter at Farpoint would really care. Yes I complain about plot holes in Into Darkness or Nemesis but it doesnt take a super fan to recognize inconsistencies. People who had only a casual interest in Trek complained about those. gtBut dont act like youre some big important Trek fan just because you watched all the commercials on UPN and bought a novel or two all the while talking about how it was a pile of crap.That was a very specific response to a now deleted post from someone who was basically shouting down anyone who ever complained about anything as being responsible for the show being off the air. I dont think Im special at all I just dont think I can be blamed for Star Treks commercial failures. The fans arent to blame for Star Trek leaving television or changing hands to a new creative team or anything like that. And I dont think its fair to blame people who care enough about Star Trek to be honest both in praise and criticism. ,startrek,cko4446,2,t5_2qixm

Also throughout the s Trek had a mass audience. It didnt lose it because it was too smart for them and needed to be dumbed down if it was then TNG and DS wouldnt have had the ratings they had it lost it because the brand started to sour with oversaturation which turned into rehash after rehash of lazy writing phonedin performances and general hackiness.

There was a weak implication that youre supposed to accept that a good amount of time has passed but would it really have killed them to have a throwaway line about how hard it was to get the ship back together? Or just in general they pay lip service to stuff like replicator rations but its hard to take seriously as they never seem to be under any real difficulties due to supply shortages. The ballooning amount of torpedoes coming out of nowhere for example. They could have gotten some interesting plots out of Voyager having to trade for supplies and whatnot maybe present a tough decision about whether it was a good idea to supply the planets leaders with the torpedo schematics. Plus do a couple of episodes like that and people stop complaining about where the hell the supplies are coming from because youve clearly established that Voyager is doing this kind of trading even if you stop showing it in later seasons. TNG gets away with not directly dealing with stiff like repairs only because its established that theyre never too far from home.

I mean cmon Star Trek XIII hasnt even got a title or a release date yet the very least we as fans could do is give it the benefit of the doubt until something concrete is released. Even if you disliked the previous two movies there are too many unknownfactors at play to justify prejudging it.

So cmon guys chill out a bit.Anyway about the possibility of a Shatner cameorole. I dont think the film necessarily has to have a timetravel plot for it to work.

Bankss Culture series?  AIs would be much more capable of controlling a starship than humans.

2280289,0,t3_2l8opi,Under the circumstances the plot Its logical for Star Fleet to assume a more aggressive posture. Perhaps the militaristic expansion needs to be refined to a more passive thing. The ships may have more advanced technology but not necessarily war ships. SF was always about finding the best solution to difficult problems even when faced with certain annihilation. Upholding its principles till death. Sacrifice in face of brutality. To prove a point. While this script is a logical extrapolation on the events of Voyager ST is not about logic. Its about the ideas ideals and moral values which SF tries to bring to conflicting species. While I appreciate your effort this plot looks like a plot for a series based upon the latest movies. But its not what ST is about. And I would hate to see it unfold like this. I understand that youre not Roddenberry but if you are really serious about making this a THING go down on war. Way down. Every scenario that youve imagined  think of a passive solution. It wont be always possible yes but dont make it a rule to go in guns blazing. Thanks. ,startrek,cltk84a,1,t5_2qixm

2284146,0,t1_cltmokz,I dont think so. At least from my perspective I didnt give it too much thought when it was on air because A I was busy with life at the timeno cable TV and B Trek burnout. I had been watching Star Trek religiously since TNG first aired.I started watching ENT and falling in love with it maybe because there hasnt been a trek on for a long time but thats not why I like it. If that were the case then Id like TAS more than I do. not muchHeres something Ive posted before about why I love ENT.gtSame here. Im from a family of trekkies and I grew up on TNG which was my favorite for most of my life. When ENT came out I was sort of busy with life and could only catch an episode here and there at my parents house  I didnt have cable back then just like now. However once it was added to Netflix and I was able to do multiple playthroughs I fell in love.gtENT is now my favorite series and I think it does a better job at episodic exploration the drama of interpersonal relationships and combat and the fleshing out of Star Trek lore than any other series. Plus I feel Captain Archer progresses the most as a character than anyone else. The naivete he had exploring for the time right until the end where hes a seasoned battlehardened human that can still see the point in exploring the unknown fostering the spirit of camaraderie between the species of the soon to be UFP serves as an analogue for the progression of the human species as a whole in the early years of discovery with the warp  engine.Edit These are just my opinions so please dont treat them as me stating facts as they are not.

The Nexus doesnt explain Sorans motivation because we are told that everything that happened to Soran also happened to Guinan and yet one character is malignant and the other is benign. We also see Picard and Kirk experience the Nexus and it has no more profound effect on them than maybe a night out drinking would be. Therefore Sorans behavior is unexplained or nonsensical. If Soran was as he claims formerly a moral person what made him abandon his principles? What else did he try to do cope with his loss? Did he seek therapy? Drugs? Did he follow the development of holodecks that could offer much the same fantasy play as the Nexus in a controllable way? Did he ever wrestle with the concept that his having less than perfect satisfaction doesnt justify wiping out whole star systems? Again Guinan experienced the same trauma without turning into a monster so something else turned Soran into a monster and we dont have a clue what that is.,startrek,cme6zlk,1,t5_2qixm

2584363,0,t3_2pdbyy,In regards to Frakes not being on the list. Frakes directed First Contact which is my favorite TNG film. He has been director for multiple tv series recently. I like Frakes. I was hoping that he might try to bring some of the Gene Roddenberrys ideals back to Trek. The jj verse just doesnt feel like trek.Normal verse people tend to act with reason I say tend because we do see some examples of stupidity. But the entire plot arc of a movieepisode is never based around a center characters sheer incompetence. Or I cant think of one if you have one let me know I take criticism well. I like to be proven wrong. Its how I learn. They usually technobableproblem solve their way out of trouble to a usually good conclusion of the episodemovie. jj verse on the other handKirk was an idiot for fighting nero alone the federation has thousands of ships. When you are helplessly outgunned it is better to make a strategic retreat and fight another day than to fight for no reason and die. Kirk helped spock on some helpless revenge run and luckedlens flared his way through it.Kirk was an idiot for bringing on an unknown missile with unknown properties. Kirk was an idiot for firing Scotty.Kirk was an idiot in many regards in that movie were he a regular sane person the film wouldnt have happened.As much as I would love to think that the candidates listed would do a better job than JJ I dont believe it. The more modern directors seem to just put explosions and shooting in place of the ethical issues. First Contact is great because it is a hybrid you have the explosions to entertain the crowd that wants that. But then there is the prime directive  the temporal prime directive and a whole host of ehtical issues faced. I think renegades axanar and the other handful of decent budget fan produced Trek will be the only way we get any new star trek that fits with the trends and feel of pre JJ trek.,startrek,cmvwwte,5,t5_2qixm

2676389,0,t1_cn7vygk,As I said my issue with Voyager is not that it isnt serialized.  My problem is that they forget the premise of being lost alone and far from home.  One week they talk about wagering replicator rations and the next week theyre firing up the Holodecks with no regard for power use.  Theres nothing about Voyager in the vast majority of the show aside from the dialogue that would suggest they are actually lost far from home.I dont hate Voyagerin fact I like quite a few episodes.  But the best episodes are reminders of how much better the show could have been if theyd stuck with the premise.  Year of Hell is a story about Voyagers decay in the absence of Starfleet making tenuous alliances and the crew splitting upall elements that would have been great if used as overall themes instead of a twoparter.  We actually see the characters dealing with the reduced functionality of the ship and the limitations of their situation.  Likewise Worst Case Scenario is an episode about a Maquis uprising overthrowing Captain Janewayan interesting idea that flows from the mostly abandoned premise that half of Voyagers crew were enemies of the Federation in the Alpha Quadrant.  Both episodes show off well that the show really works when those themes are explored.  And in both of these great episodes they LITERALLY hit the reset button at the endYear of Hell ends with a hacky it never happened time travel plotpoint and Worst Case Scenario turns out to take place in the Holodeck.  Their best story ideas that flow naturally from the premise are thrown away and literally reset at the end.  Thats why I say objectively DSs writing is betterbecause even if you dont like the show the stories at least flow from the premise of a station orbiting a world following a devastating occupation.  And they dont throw away their best ideas with hacky resets.  I do think that DSs religious angle went too far near the endGene would be rolling in his grave.Ill ignore the fact that you seem to think Im a dumb kid because I wasnt around when TOS aired.  One of my points was that DSs partially serialized storytelling was ahead of its timeI watched all the other Star Trek series when they originally aired.  Incidentally Ill write critiques of any other Star Trek series just as scathing because I love the shows and Ive seen them all.  The first two seasons of TNG and DS are mostly garbage with a few gems and the seventh season of both suffered from severe idea shortages.  TOS despite its progressive message inventive gadgets and memorable characters is often sexist garbageand many show off the limitations of the Genes vision.  Enterprise suffers from an unpredictable and often inexplicably ignorant captain wonky prequelsyndrome and severe Vulcanblaming.  But Ive seen them all and I enjoyed them.  Theyre Star Trek after all. ,startrek,cn7xbv9,1,t5_2qixm
2680146,0,t3_2qo8ln,You really think Scott Bakula is convincing?  I love the guy but he is stilted as all hell.  He has very little presence.  He worked great on Quantum Leap but the way he delivers lines trying to be a tough captain or whatever ...I dunno he just always seems to sound wimpy or something.  Compare him to Nathan Fillion who played Malcom Reynolds on Firefly.  Nathan Fillion is not who I would think of when I think tough badass captain and yet he pulled it off.  Really well.  He was convincing.  Scott is just like too Nice Guy.  Also a considerable portion of the episodes are nothing more than rehash of old westerns or other paintbynumbers plots.  Consider Marauders in Season  as a particularly formulaic cheesy pointless and silly episode.  Last I gotta say Mayweather and Reed are just really weak.  It almost seems like the casting director knew they didnt want to overshadow Scott which would be pretty easy to do so they kept the rest of the dudes pretty weak and basic.  ,startrek,cn8ez92,1,t5_2qixm

And yes this includes TNG which got a ton of shit from diehard TOS fans who just couldnt stop saying that since the TOS cast was still making movies they should have been given a series. Source me paleoTrekkie i.e. have watched it since it was originally broadcast and had internet access preEternal September. gt And then theres In The Pale Moonlight. A couple of the biggest complaints leveled at the latest movie can be leveled at that episode.Not with much justification. STID is more of a straightup post analogy given that the whole KhanVengeance thing is a reaction to one really bad day. Not only was In the Pale Moonlight set well into an ongoing war not insignificant in terms of the actions taken but its remarkable that DS itself ended more than two years before  and addressed some of the concerns about civil liberties and the security state well before they became part of the evening news. If the specific concern for both is that well the Federation just doesnt do that well DS is the first and really only Trek series set during an ongoing war VOY for the most part took place well away from the action and was only peripherally involved ENT didnt last long enough to cover the Romulan war. Its appropriate that they addressed ethical concerns that even maybe especially a relatively open and free society needs to face during a major war.gt When they brought in the Defiant and Worf it felt like fanservice.sigh OK Im going to try not to be ranty here but fanservice like Mary Sue is one of those terms that gets bandied about so much that it tends to lose any real meaning. The thing about fanservice is that its obviously even risibly gratuitous putting a deassimilated exdrone in a skintight suit with no overlayer is gratuitous as is taking every opportunity to show your topranking female officer in underwear or less arguably so are the miniskirt uniforms of TOS not shown in either of the pilots or most of Trois outfits. Theres nothing particularly gratuitous about stationing an experimental warship at a space station thats guarding a wormhole to an extremely hostile empire that just destroyed one of your most advanced starships with a much smaller craft nor is it gratuitous to transfer in an experienced officer who also happens to be one of Starfleets top experts on another empire that just kicked a centuryold peace treaty to the curb. ,startrek,cncgqcb,5,t5_2qixm

Though it was also designed to show human arrgoance and that maybe maybe we shouldnt be exploring the galaxy in a warp five ship because we are in fact a savage race and we did need oversite from the vulcans. Thats one thing I loved and still love about enterprise. Theres always this uneasy feeling about the majority of the decisions made. Do we really have the right to be meddling in this race? Do we really have the right to even be exploring this ship? The Ethics of enterprise are supposed to be uneasy.

3016722,0,t1_coa4b93,Interesting theory. My head cannon always assumed that they never actually reached warp  but instead made it to something really really really close. So close that the sensors couldnt distinguish the difference. Maybe something like warp .... with  nines after the decimal place. I figured that after a certain number nines following the decimal point you achieve infinite velocity not truly infinite but effectively so within a certain radius. This radius would expand as you got closer and closer to Warp  but would never truly encompass the whole universe. In the episode Tom was able to collect detailed sensor logs only of the sector they were in. Maybe instead of the computer being filled up at that point he only achieve infinite velocity within that sector?I like to think that Toms evolution was not really evolution but rather a series of random mutations were caused not by the extreme speed itself but rather by the fact that he was occupying all points in the sector at once. While occupying all points in the sector at once his DNA could have been affected by any number of things  Alien DNA Radiation it is kind of hard for the shields to keep radiation out when you are in all places at once Sharing the same point as a star Sharing the same point as a black hole etc.,startrek,coaojbk,1,t5_2qixm

Most of their planets are agrarian farmer level yet they build ships with the power of stars?  Their robotics tech is a joke but their FTL is insanely advanced?  Societies dont tend to have advances in  fields of research and absolutely zero parallel advances even culturally.  Their primary fighting was done via manually operated dog fighting planes.... With no shielding. Why?  How could they actually do anything to a larger ship? This debate is sort of dumb.... Star Trek is scifi and Star Wars is fantasy with robots.

3047093,0,t3_2v1vp7,Primarily it seems obvious that internal force fields are just scaleddown versions of the wellknown external deflector shields. That helps to understand the very basic properties of the force fields which subsequently constitute the EMH. So this boils down to the fact that the question vastly depends on the amount of energy transferred by the laser andor phaser beam that interacts with the EMH.     Strong energy transmitting beams generally wear down force fields and penetrate them after their maximum absorption potential is reached  this happens when the EMH is attacked with a phaser weapon. Additionally phaser are particle streams comprised of nadions  the Doctors holographic appearance seems to optimizedconfigured to absorbrefractreflect light in the visible spectrum. A laser on the other hand is a flow of photons. Borg lasers do not appear to have any capacity to penetrate  their intensity is not that high and their wavelength is on the lower end lower energy per photon of the visible spectrum as their ocular implants possess red beams.   This leads to the conclusion that the Borg lasers are reflected similar to visible light unless they have builtin holographic countermeasures which jam the holographic emitters or they can vary the energy output of their ocular implants up to a value above the tolerance level of the EMH.    Edit I researched a bit more and encountered this specific scene in STFirst Contact where Picard and Lily hide on the holodeck. Two drones enter and proceed with scanning a hologram whereby the holographic image is massively destabilized. So apparently a Borg laser is able to penetrate a holgram in a way though the laser of the ocular implant is not as focused in this specific scene.YT link to the aforementioned scene ,startrek,codtwko,3,t5_2qixm

Great action strong characterizations life or death stakes and a sense of melancholy at the characters aging.  Plus Spock has some big moments.  and  make up a trilogy  The Search For Spock is the weakest of them but still enjoyable and was Leonard Nimoys first directing job.

3279658,0,t3_2xoemp,I thought its against regulation for the captain to date a member of the crew. No?  I assumed thats why he goes on away missions so often. To get some alien tail. EDIT  this is what I was thinking of.  Regulation EditThis regulation covers fraternization between Starfleet members. Starfleet members may not engage in business or romantic relationships with superiors in their direct chain of command inasmuch as this may be harmful to discipline andor the functioning of the organization. Clause Beta prohibits officerenlisted relationships Clause Gamma covers relationships between one officer and another subordinate officer and Clause Theta prohibits a commanding officer or other unit head from being in a relationship with any other member of their unit.Antifraternization policies are common to nearly all codes of military law but Starfleets is notably looser than usual due to the dual nature of the service as both a military service and an exploratory and diplomatic service. Because Federation starships are often out for months or even years at a time between ports it is practically inevitable for such relationships to form and so R has been interpreted rather loosely by the Starfleet Judge Advocate Generals Corps with the emphasis being on preventing only relationships verifiably harmful to the organization rather than any relationship at all. Overly familiar platonic relationships are also banned but are generally overlooked for much the same reason. The regulation does not prohibit relationships between Starfleet personnel in different departments or specialties within the same unit even in cases of rank difference as the participants are not in the same direct chain of command. ,startrek,cp23vpf,-1,t5_2qixm

Wanna see how the Reliant would fare against the refit Enterprise without the element of surprise?  hint it wouldnt end well.One neat feature was that the bigger the ship the more powerful it was but the slower it turned.

I think they could have made the time frame closer ...maybe thirty or forty years later but I suspect they didnt want to deal with the issue of people questioning which characters from the original cast would still have been around had they done that instead which is why I think they opted for eight decades later. That way they could sidestep the original cast pretty much entirely while also leaving out other questions about the lack of similarity of the aesthetics between the original series and the new series.And I never liked the idea of kids on board either nor did most of the producers and writing team.

3424766,0,t1_cpikw0q,Actually the job that Chief OBrien did was closer to an E.  Commander Riker is closer to a Commander or at minimum the first officer on a ship.  This rank in the US Navy might not always be Commander but it is usually O to O or Lieutenant Commander or Commander.  Typically in conversation O is referred to as Commander to make it easier on the person talking.Petty officers existed in Starfleet so that means that NCOs did in the same respect that officers exist the only reason most of the characters we meet are officers is because of the fact that theyre the most identifiable ranking structure for the general public in the military.  This is explainable and justifiable in character because officers go to Starfleet Academy which is their equivalent of a four year prestigious university and because of that the cadets learn much more hands on and much more intensive fields.  That means that a regular recruit might be able to get on board a starship quickly but theyd just be a crewman and theyd never be able to hold command.That said that isnt to say that an enlisted or noncommissioned officer might not be very important.  In fact in Chief OBriens case we get to see an NCO becoming extremely important on Deep Space Nine but this just shows that said NCOs might be treated equivalent to officers in certain circumstances.  It is heavily implied because of this that there are chiefs and maybe even master chiefs on a Federation starship the same way there are lieutenant commanders and Captains on a ship.  All the difference is who went to Starfleet Academy and who didnt.  People can join Starfleet without going to the Academy but you just wont have a commission as an officer.  It works the same way in the Navy you enlist you go through Basic training and you get sent onto a ship or a shore command but there are dozens of enlisted personnel for every officer.Hopefully this makes it clearer.,startrek,cpinclu,9,t5_2qixm

3543337,0,t1_cpw50d4,gtShit yeah  Id have no issue with it.  Parts of it i.e. Threshold have already been removed from canon anyway.  I also dont consider Enterprise to be canon since it sucks and messes up continuity e.g. the Ferengi and the Borg.It sucks therefore it doesnt exists. Does that mean Spock is still dead. Because TSFS sucks according to me? Every movie with Spock would be noncanon to me. That is just silly. The encounter with the Borg makes perfect sense. It ties in with First Contact and the fact that Q sent Enterprise to see that the Borg were already on their way assuming that they heard the distress call the two lost Borg sent out. Which hey said word take about  years to get there.gtBesides if you take Voyager awaygt The Borg are a much more convincing antagonist before they were castrated by Voyager which reduced them to the point where they could be bargained with VOY Scorpion or fucked with VOY Unimatrix Zero.The Borg became obsolete once Picard defeated them they never recovered. gt DS does a much better job of addressing the Maquis from the threat they pose to the role of former Starfleet personnel Eddington and Hudson to their destruction at the hands of the Dominon.  Voyager only sees them as a minor issue in a handful of episodes e.g. VOY Learning Curve.The Maquis were in the alpha quadrant not the Delta. They were a way to tie in VOY to the universe. Why would they need to expand on a group that is k light years away. gt We really dont need the magic bullet and God Mode from VOY Endgame transphasic torpedoes and Batmobile armour.Yes the series finale was bad but every single Trek finale has been bad. gt Anything that happened on Voyager was moot anyway because of the Magic Reset Button they applied every week.  One week the ship is mostly destroyed by the Vidiians or the Hirogen or the Krenim the next week its fine.  Im not saying it had to be like Battlestar Galactica but something more convincing than simple reboot is much better.Yes because we need  minute recaps of how they were able to find a friendly trader or planet to explain what is obvious at the beginning of every episode. It makes sense that they would find ways to repair and refuel. There is no need to spoon feed it. gt Neelix would never have been encountered.Neelix was awesome.

There have been numerous articles about how entire scenes have been changed because Shatner either pictched an aboslute hissy or said Thats not what Kirk would do and maybe he was right on that aspect but still. Everything Ive seen has said that Shatner is essentially well represented by Tim Allens character. In the movie he goes through a transformation of self worth. This is what I wished would have happened to Shatner... its what he needs. Just the fact that this is posted here in rstartrek and getting serious attention makes this point just consider that we dont have Babylon  Firefly or Star Wars stuff here standing alone without much reference to Star TrekDo not mistake my rambling as a commentary on his acting skills. Except. For his. Pauses in weird.... places... his acting skills are really top notch and I can thoroughly stand behind the character and personality traits he portrayed including the Wild West Cowboy portrayal of what is supposed to be the best mankind offers.The entire cast of Galaxy Quest did a great job but I cant see a series being as well scripted and acted as the movie was and I think this would be a mark against the statement that I feel needed to be said and needs to stand tall as an example for all who follow in Shatners extremely large footsteps.,startrek,cqk1unb,10,t5_2qixm

I mean you know quark is constantly looking for any way to make more profit he can find. To me thats the interesting thing about quarks character. He is not evil and if all things are equal he would like to do the right thing. But when latinum is involved and things are not equal he will take the profit over everything else. the evolution of quarks character is toward becoming at least a little less self centered and greedy.

4308493,0,t1_csbaau1,I think story arcs are something you can do when youve got people hooked but until they are you need self contained episodes. As a percentage of episodes made TOS S was very high on the quality front. TNGs first season was horrible and the second wasnt much better. Once it got into season  it started having some killer episodes and Season  of TOS had some howling stinkers. Later TNG was far better on average than early and TOS never really got to show how it would develop and I think were probably better for not having had more than three seasons of it because it was clearly on a downward trajectory.The thing is though Star Trek has been a journey and watching the shows in their broadcast order is the right way to do it as you see the development of the style and ideas. Some episodes are a struggle but I still think people should work through them and they have some redeeming features. Otherwise just randomly selecting episodes from TOS or TNG would be fine but DS has to be watched all the way through because of the story arc and thats something for the dedicated fan IMHO.,startrek,csbak0d,1,t5_2qixm

Sisko on the other hand is very playful when hes been disrespected by his crew. Just watched Bashir interrupt a subspace message from Dukat and try and procure a runabout for Garek. Siskos reaction is almost giddy he gets to mess with  a junior officer.

5158142,0,t1_cv6ql0w,Its a... different notion of temperature than the one youre probably used to. The distribution of energies will unless something truly funky is happening always follow an exponential pattern. The fraction of the atoms or whatever with kinetic energy E measured in Joules say will be Z expEkT where T turns out to be the temperature in Kelvin and k is Boltzmanns constant which fixes the units... its Joules per Kelvin so the argument of the exponential function is unitless which it has to be. k is around .x JK not that thats very important. Z is the partition function and varies from substance to substance but doesnt change within one substance as E or T changes. Anyway because of the negative sign in there the function always decreases as the energy increases. So more energetic atoms are rarer than less energetic atoms. Unless T is negative... A negative temperature describes a very unusual situation where the population of more energetic atoms is larger. This sort of situation is always unstable and has to be carefully set up to exist. The most common situation where this happens is in the generation of a laser beam. Such a system will give energy to any normal system with positive temperature so negative temperatures are in some sense hotter than positive temperatures. Yes that is weird. Anyway the older more widely known definition of temperature as the average kinetic energy of the atoms or whatever making up a substance matches up perfectly with the above when the temperature is positive though so the difference usually doesnt matter. ,startrek,cv7qy5v,3,t5_2qixm

He gets caught because Odo was supposed to deactivate certain security features but didnt because of his involvement with the female changeling. So the scene I like most is the one right after Rom gets caught and Kira is storming down the corridors on her way to have it out with him. The way Nana Visitor plays that scene the seething anger the vitriol the way she slams her fist into the bulkheads... It made it seem so real. Visitor was fantastic on that show the role was made for her.

5356945,0,t3_3ocoqs,DS is the best written with deep characters and complicated plots and storylines. Its darker than the other star treks and focuses a bit on what the rest of the world in the star trek universe is like. Its the most similar to TNG so I recommend that next if you havent seen it.Voyager is a lot of fun and has more of the adventure star trek feel. A lot of people criticize it because of weird plot lines and a more action based feel but I think its great.If you havent watch the original series do that. Its pretty campy and out of date but its a lot of fun.Enterprise is weird. I like it but its kind of bad in a lot of ways. Its trying to do too many things and its not sure what it is most of the time. Season  is a weird throwback to older star treks and full of references Season  is trying to create its own feel and universe Season  is a great dramatic cliffhanger action story and Season  was the writers running out of idea and coming up with a lot of gibberish. Lowest priority but worth watching for a lot of the characters and a few amazing episodes.Battlestar Galactica was created by the creators of DS. Its pretty much what both DS and Voyager should have been. A small group of people lost in deep space trying to find their way home full of political drama strong character driven story epic space battles and deep philosophical issues. Its not officially star trek but its better in a lot of ways and has a lot of very similar themes to a number of TNG and DS episodes.

After the swift asswhoopin dealt by the Borg theyd have to start updating their ships and fleet the personnel and resources had to be reassigned to accommodate which lead to Defiant Akira Steamrunner Saber and Sovereign classes and then theyd need to start phasing out the older ships.

5797864,0,t3_3uldei,I can think of some reasons. Picard is quite a bit older than the rest of the bridge crew. He was also wearing a rank designation that they immediately noticed.  The Satarrans went to a lot of trouble to ensure people retained their skills but not their memories. Picards leadership and tactical expertise may have been considered vital. They may have wished to keep the number of changes minimal. Demoting Riker to Second Officer and inserting Commander MacDuff is a minimal change. It means less records and logs to alter. Demoting Picard would be potentially the biggest change they could possibly make.  The further from the truth they try to change things the more likely they are to be caught. Humans notice discrepancies.  The most obvious easy excuse is that theres a room on deck  with a door labelled Captains Quarters. I believe it also has his name on it. That room is full of Picards personal belongings. They cant do anything about physical objects. ,startrek,cxfs3ch,14,t5_2qixm

5836591,0,t1_cxkooai,Definitely fair comments.  On the other hand Spock has been portrayed I think slightly more emotionally in these movies and also a little less knowitall to a certain extent so I could see it working... if he sees how distraught Kirk is at the mere thought of it being the Khan guy maybe just running to the nearest console to look it up might not be the right reaction... they have a budding friendship here remember so seeing his friend in distress might make him react a little differently in this incarnation.Besides I know I keep repeating myself but even though youre right about Bones not being a historian if Khan is really as bad as hes meant to be then itd be like one of us not knowing the name Hitler now... it would be a bit WTF... then again I suppose you could fairly make the same argument about Spock youd certainly expect him to know who Hitler was so wouldnt he know Khan too?Eh its all just good conversation... the key point is none of us likes the way it was ACTUALLY done ,startrek,cxkpcxs,1,t5_2qixm

5904269,0,t3_3w3ofm,Ironically watching the remastered version is more seamless and less jarring than watching the original FX version.  The live action shots were mastered in mm film.  And so when they were scanned for HD they looked crisp.  Some of the live action shots looked like they couldve been filmed today.But the FX shots were mastered on low resolution film.  They do not look HD.  They do not even look good enough for video.  Theyre extremely blurry and grainy.  Watching an entire episode in HD its very jarring whenever the episode transition from HD live action shots to these awfully blurry FX shots.  One moment youre watching HD then suddenly you find yourself staring at something that looks like a th generation video tape copy.The remastered CGI effects are totally new and look just as HD as the live action shots.  Watching an entire episode the transition from HD live action to HD special FX is seamless.  The original series was never intended to be watched on anything other than a s analog television.  They never imagined people would be watching these episodes in high definition and so the effects had always been in low resolution.This is not like the TNG remaster where the HD version meticulously recreated the special FX for HD presentation.  The TOS remaster of the original FX simply scanned the original master which had always been in low resolution.  If you want the effects scenes in HD youd have to watch the CGI version.,startrek,cxtl0kw,3,t5_2qixm

5946026,0,t1_cxyweix,I sure the problem is people are complaining about a plot that has yet to be revealed.  A teaser trailer is that a teaser.

People complaining that the music isnt fitting for the trailer the trailers pacing or the lens flairs are justifiable.  Those opinion can be pinpointed to the actual trailer.  People saying the film ruins Star Trek or that plot is horrible are not justifiable because they are baseless claims.  You cant criticize a nonexisting plot.With that being said I dont think leaving the forums is going to solve anything.  Its the internet.  Anyone can be bold online because there is no physical interactivity.

The way the world is today these topics just arent as appealing to a mass audience the way that they were in the late th century.

Given thats the case it makes logistical sense to keep the headquarters of Starfleet there too since they are so inextricably tied. And with both the political and military centers of the Federation on the same planet it also follows that many associated organizations such as Starfleet medical would also be headquartered there. Note that its never said that for example Utopia Planitia is the largest shipyard Starfleet has. It just gets brought up a lot because it happens to be next to Earth. Its entirely possible that Starfleets main shipbuilding facilities are in a nebula somewhere that just hasnt been mentioned. Also note that while Starfleet Sciences is based on Earth they no doubt are more of an organizational body and that the bulk of the research takes place in other facilities. It would be reasonable to assume that the Vulcan Science Academy has a much higher pedigree of up and coming scientists studying there than Earth does.gt Starfleet is almost exclusively humanThis may actually be the case but its also plausible that we as viewers tend to be shown human crews over others. The obvious reason is budget of course but inuniverse one could argue that Starfleet intentionally groups up ships with compatible crews into the same areas so that in the event of any cooperative effort they would be better suited to work together. Vulcans for example have always been shown to have fundamentally different ways of thinking than humans. Benzites cant breathe standard classM air.  Betazoids would probably go insane if they were on a mixed ship hearing the unfiltered thoughts of everyone on board .Also consider that amongst all the major species portrayed across Trek humans are shown by far to be the most adventurous and willing to take risks. Therefore it would make sense for Starfleet to assign mostly human crews to do exploration which would also explain why the various Enterprises tend to only run into other human crews. Note that throughout the Dominion war Starfleet fielded close to a thousand starships and we are only ever privy to the crew composition of a select few of them throughout all the series. Its entirely plausible that while exploration and military engagements tend to be assigned to human crews the majority of the crews assigned to the more mundane tasks of transport patrols medical science etc are in fact nonhuman crews. And the reason we never hear of these crews is because the titular ships and one station that we follow are all on the frontier of exploration far beyond the safe confines of Federation core worlds. So one could argue that Starfleet is not actually majority human its just the parts were shown that are.gt Be it the Quadrants or Sectors mapping system being used both use Earth as the point of referenceThis is true but also a nonissue. Someone had to divide up the galaxy and they happened to choose Earth as a starting point thats all. Its similar to the fact that London is UTC . Its just an arbitrary point that no one really cares about.gt Earth dominates the diplomacy ...... assuming there is a nonhuman representing the Federation at allThis isnt actually true. There are many many episodes wherein the Enterprise is tasked with escorting a nonhuman diplomat to an important negotiation. Off the top of my head I can think of Datas Day Man of the People and Sarek. We also hear a lot about Curzon Dax though I cant remember the episode. And lest we forget Kirks trial at the end of Star Trek IV was chock full of nonhumansgt Humans seem unique within the Federation for having the unusual need to colonize world all over the place while most species stick around their home systemThe second part of your statement isnt true at all. Were shown plenty of nonhuman colonies including Vulcan and Bajoran. And even if we werent shown many I already touched on the argument that Starfleet would try to assign human crews to be near other human ships and colonies. Its reasonable logical one might even say for Vulcan ships to patrol Vulcan colonies.The first part of your statement is true insofar as humans are incredibly prolific. As I mentioned canonically humans have a drive for exploration and adventure that surpasses any other species so it makes sense that they like to go settle on random planets. Given thats the case it also makes sense that frontier starships with human crews are also more likely to encounter such colonies in the case of trouble.gt Maybe its because Earth seems to constantly be the only planet in perilIf you were to count all the episodes wherein some planetmoon is in peril across all of Trek I think you would find that Earth is merely one among hundreds. We tend to feel a greater sense of urgency towards it as viewers because its our home but Earth is by no means in the most danger. In fact given how central it is to the Federation its surprising that it ever gets in trouble at all. The only instances I can think of when it was truly in peril are the Xindi weapon Vger the whale probe and the two Borg invasions. That may sound like a lot but consider that Vger was originally from earth as were the whales so those had nothing to do with the Federation. The two borg invasions were directed at Starfleet headquarters as a tactical move. Now contrast Earth with other planets. Betazed was lost to the Dominion. Cardassia had all its major cities razed and almost a billion civilians massacred. The Klingon homeworld of QonoS was in danger of extinction after their only moon exploded. Compared to these and many others Earth actually gets away relatively unscathed throughout all the series.gt I wouldnt be shocked if Humans not only where the most numerous species in the Federation but a majorityThis is pretty much impossible. At the time of First Contact the human population had been reduced to th century levels and due to the loss of most world governments major cities and infrastructure its safe to say that population growth had also slowed considerably. On top of that the fact is Earth can only comfortably fit  billion people and there is no mention in canon of another human colony or planet that comes anywhere near that number. The largest ever mentioned is Alpha Eridani II with a population of  million. The next largest is Deneva with under  million. All other human colonies we see number only in the thousands. Now consider that the Federation has  member worlds each one having obviously passed the requirements to develop warp capability which requires significant history social structure and industrial infrastructure. Given this fact along with what weve seen of other major member planets its reasonable to assume their populations are similar to Earths in size. Based on this there is no way Earth is any significant fraction of the Federation as a whole. gt Almost all ships are named after Earth historyThis is totally true and not cool. Not cool humans! Let the andorians name a ship for once!,startrek,cyhf0u1,47,t5_2qixm

If you are looking to find that hook to bring you in to watch more as far as DS is concerned I highly recommend season  episode  and episode  Improbable Cause and The Die is Cast.  These episodes are a small arc so you have to watch them together but they wound up saving my Trek experience further down the road.  By this time we had a VCR so I was able to record the show.  When these episodes aired I recorded them and was showing them to my best friend.  My uncle came to visit from out of town and he had not seen the show but he watched these two episodes with me and my best friend and he was hooked!  After that Star Trek Voyager came out and we didnt have cable so I couldnt watch it on UPN so my uncle started recording it for me.  Every couple months when hed come to visit hed bring new episodes of Voyager for me to binge on!   I would not have been able to watch Voyager at that time and then later Enterprise if it hadnt been for those two DS episodes that got him hooked and subsequently got him recording them for me too!  ,startrek,cykektv,1,t5_2qixm

Now some people would say they just claim thisto give the Federation plausible deniability. And thats possible but we know from Extreme Measures that they have an operative in the Federation Presidents Cabinet sending them reports on the President. Why would a legitimate organization be spying on the commanderinchief? So Id say they are indeed unaccountable or at least think they are and thats dangerous.

When I first heard of the line I was in part hoping for something along the sizequalitybuild of what Product Enterprise did some years ago with the Space Eagles but realized that would be impossible  costs of an Engineers Reference Series would make the line outofreach for pretty much everyone. Similarly keeping all the offerings to a single scale would be impractical.These are solid very good quality and good to great detail offerings. I know the DS itself got some knocks for the painting scheme but short of building one yourself or maybe accurizing the old Playmates toy youre not going to find much better.Im also happy theyre delving deep into the series for a lot of designs  background ships from the Dominion War and Wolf  a few from the Animated Series etc.  but Id still like to see the old Franz Joseph designs from the Starfleet Technical Manual the Dreadnaught the tug the ScoutDestroyer. ,startrek,czl3od7,1,t5_2qixm

In reality Picard was never the action hero type lets ignore that they tried to make him that in the later movies they intended Riker for the Away Team role from the start the whole rule was a plot device for TNG to make that happen and overall in TNG we did see Picard on away missions a few times... it just became less important from a storytelling perspective i think so they conveniently never mentioned it again.  ,startrek,d0d9wnq,6,t5_2qixm

Nothing seemed out of place or like it was too much except for the aforementioned bloom effects lens flares.The sets are well done and eraappropriate. Not sure about the compression rifle they introduced which looks like one of the phaser rifles from VOY. Most of the other props were good and eraappropriate. The wardrobe was pretty good but it seemed like a few of the uniforms just didnt fit correctly on some of the actors. Something like this is to be expected for a lowbudget production. My guess is that the wardrobe was premade and not tailored to the actor so it could be reused.The writing was...alright. It wasnt bad but I wasnt in love with the dialog. A lot of it seemed forced but that could have just been the actors. It almost seemed like they wanted to stay true to the script at the expense of more organic dialog. This also could have been a direction issue.The story was interesting but it didnt feel right. It felt like Star Trek but not like Star Trek at the same time. Almost like an impostor that looks and sounds just like Star Trek put on Star Treks clothes for a day and lived its life but deep down you know its someone else.On the Star Trek fan film scale I give it a .

This was completely typical for Roddenberry.  And he would usually take the last pass on scripts he hadnt had anything to do with in order to get a writing credit.You might check out the famous story about him taking cowriting credit on the theme song merely by adding some lyrics which never actually got used in the show.

Its interesting and I think it might have to do with people expectations and what they views as their preferred things in Trek favored storytelling styles etc. rather than something like bad storytelling which imho is not a fair description of STID. It is better written than  though it could have benefitted from a different longer cut because the way they cut it to fit within h made some things less obvious if youre not watching closely especially when it comes to elements like Khans torpedoes and the things between him amp Marcus. ,startrek,d0g5a1d,0,t5_2qixm

And usually by emotionally immature white guys who are mad because people are finally telling them to behave themselves.

Even if there always have been Trek toys and tieins they were very few when you compare it with say Star Wars and not from the top manufacturers. Only after the split from Viacom and all merchandising rights going to CBS were starting to see more toys and better quality collectibles.In the case of video games Activision literally dropped the rights to create games for Trek in  even after some very successful games like Armada and Elite Force because Paramount was doing absolutely nothing to help Trek grow. Bethesda got the rights on  and did the same thing shortly afterwards. Those are two of the industry biggest publishers and they said Paramount wasnt doing enough to promote the franchise!!This attitude remains today with the last two games under Paramount DAC and Star Trek  being complete garbage while being directly supervised by Paramount its like theyre happy just doing the bare minimum to just cash in on the franchise instead of doing something more significant.

7209522,0,t1_d1xnh64,gtMy question is why bother rehashing story elements to try to make them relevant? You could thrust the federation into an entirely new set of circumstances and stay true to the scifi heart of star trek.True. But another part of working with an established universe is you dont throw away the established elements. The whole point of continuity and a fictional universe is there are continuing threads consequences repercussions etc. Ill admit at worse maybe the Borg idea is a pet idea of mine but it actually touches on a lot of things that if not relevant to a lot of people right now will be sooner or later. We live in a rapidly advancing technological society. This would be Star Treks opportunity to address a lot of those themes. A lot of scifi in my eyes fails at least in a predictive sense because it doesnt anticipate the changes that information technology connectivity etc will have on our lives. The Borg are probably the most relevant idea Star Trek has right now. But not in their current form. There are a lot of story telling opportunities waiting to happen that have not been fully explored in a highly exposed contemporary pop culture setting. Star Trek has an opportunity to do that. It just happens in my opinion that the Borg are the best vehicle for those stories. ,startrek,d1xnzo8,1,t5_2qixm

7231570,0,t3_4eei09,I want to be excited for this film but stuff like this only creates or exacerbates the impression that Paramount is afraid of what they have in this film. It would be nice if they were afraid because they have a film that embraces its Trekness to the point of losing at the box office because it fails to draw the casual moviegoer but the first trailer kills that dream dead in my mind.Are they starting to turn turtle into that weird place studios go into where they try to pretend the film doesnt exist and they can release it quietly and no one will notice its coming and going and they can just carry on? Even though that never works in real life? I dont know.I know I wanted a great anniversary film but Ive pretty much given up hope for that. I would be OK with just a good film. Even one the critics beat up as its an overlong TV episode masquerading as a movie. Id be OK with that. Disclaimer I still have a soft spot for Insurrection.But the more Paramount seems indifferent to the fact that this movie is a thing that theyre releasing soon enough now the more I feel like this is just going to be a movie Ill be aggravated I spent money on to go see in a theatre.So I probably wont unless someone really wants to see it and have me along. Or the reviews all start out along the lines of Remember when the first trailer horrified the fans? Remember that between BvS and Captain America hype you figured no other movies were coming out until the fall anyhow? Forget that go run to Star Trek Beyond.My expectation level is down to setting such a low bar that most anything the new CBS All Access series does will be hailed as genius by comparison. Disclaimer I am not pissing on the All Access series or assuming its going to suck. I just thing Beyond is really going to warp my personal viewpoint curve on how good All Access has to be for me to embrace it.I mean when you have the director saying how he discovered during making this film that Star Trek is really great television first paraphrased but I think fairly said Im possibly irretrievably at the stage of why should I care about the film at this point.,startrek,d206cxx,3,t5_2qixm

More of a movie trope but I hope it doesnt sneak into a television show but I really dont want to see any of the main characters have a case of the notgays Its the th century maybe th maybe nd regardless its the future. In a sort of libertarian post consumer society where you can do whatever you want so long as it doesnt harm a person without their permission then in the movies it seems out of place to put so much emphasis on making sure every knows that a character is heterosexual. No one should give a shit and hell even exploring that would be interesting to not simply blowover with a case of the notgays.  It would also be rather nice if early episodes affected alter episodes and there were a fewer number of standalones.

In fact to me this is the first original NuTrek film in that it isnt beholden to the Prime Universe in a way  and ID were. That said I think fans of the series would have appreciated that it wasnt trying to break off so hard from the Prime Timeline or adopt elements of it in an out of place way or bring up things that didnt make sense like Chekhov or the whole Khan debacle though I thought it was handled well enough in context. Then again without s nu origin story a lot of questions would have been raised. Ultimately I agree with the user who says it should have been the second film. ,startrek,d40781t,1,t5_2qixm
7868434,0,t3_4n2nn8,Ive always considered The Undiscovered Country to be superior to The Wrath of Khan for a simple reason of the two The Undiscovered Country is the one that works best as a standalone movie.While The Wrath of Khan works a lot of what makes it work is what you know of the franchise. You know for the most part in the original series adventures were episodic and had little to no impact on what would happen next week. TWoK works best as a deconstruction of this. Sure you might enjoy it even if youre not overly familiar with the original series or even if you hadnt seen much Star Trek at all before then but it works a lot better when you are familiar with it.The Undiscovered Country works best as a response to the political atmosphere of the time. Sure theres a few lines which work better when you know the franchise but even if this is the first Star Trek movie youve seen you can still enjoy it and it still works. Essentially The Undiscovered Country is more accessible in a way in spite of being the sixth movie in a franchise.,startrek,d40hguw,69,t5_2qixm

7873793,0,t1_d40gaco,I think nothing on screen in First Contact and Voyage Home rules out alternative universes being involved.In Voyage Home there is some overlap between when Kirk and Co go back and when they return. They appear to return before they actually go back in the past. They come back shortly after the window on Starfleet HQ shatters but after the window shatters it takes some time before the crew even attempts to go back in time.For me that makes it more likely that they went to another universe instead of just back in time. And if it were the case all other instances of the slingshot method may involve another universe as well.The another universe approach has also be my headcannon for First Contact for quite some time giving Enterprise the freedom to do what the new movies now do.,startrek,d4134zc,2,t5_2qixm

7924537,0,t3_4ntbbg,As an interested amateur linguist English is still definitely evolving but the new evolution is more based around new vocabulary than ever before. The simple reason is that we are a global culture now.Like species evolution major shifts in language occur over time when populations are either geographically isolated or when multiple languages rub up against each other. Isolation is how we end up with AmericanBritishAustralian variants of the same language which would eventually become unique if we still had to spend months traveling between these places. Meanwhile coexistence is how we end up with weirdness like Viking and Welsh grammar combined with words from German French Greek and Latin in the same language which is how Old English is so wildly different than Middle English.However Middle English as the article demonstrates is very recognizable even if it can take a bit of decoding and that was  years ago without any sort of official controls on the language. Now were far more rigid. We have standards bodies like the OED that dictate what is and isnt proper English. We have mass produced writingrecording that enforces standard spelling and pronunciation. We have global telecommunications that remove barriers between linguistic populations. New words cross the globe instantly so the lexicon advances in lock step everywhere. If anything  years in the Star Trek future their English will be much closer to our English than our English is to still recognizable Middle English.,startrek,d46sk9d,27,t5_2qixm

TWOK is held up as the pinnacle of cinematic Star Trek but unlike Space Seed its not really a detailed examination of Future Humanity vs. Present Humanity  its an action flick that centers around a hammy villain getting revenge on Kirk.The only film I would really call cerebral is TUC which it mainly inherits from being a political thriller as opposed to an action movie. Even then its less subtle than your average TNG episode.Movies are insanely expensive to make nowadays and Dumb Action Star Trek is a way more reliable cash cow than Smart Contemplative Star Trek.

The star ships are clearly not like your standard vehicle that is more than capable of hitting the speed limit and operating with limited service.

8082692,0,t1_d4oav5d,gt  I think we couldve gotten that mythical season  and beyond we might even be watching another new Enterprise.I dont think so. There was a lot more behind the cancellation of Enterprise than just Berman amp Bragas writer fatigue. Firstly UPN didnt like the idea of a prequel to begin with. In fact the whole temporal cold war came about because the network wanted a futuristic element of the show. Secondly the entire administration of UPN changed when Enterprise came on. Most of the people in charge had no idea what Star Trek was and were quite shocked when they learned that the Trek crew were pretty much given carte blanche to do whatever they want. So they started interfering more and more demanding they stay on budget per episode previously the Star Trek crew were allowed to go WAY over budget for a particular episode as long as they managed to make the seasons budget equal out at the end of the year...and they always did.Another reason for Enterprises poor ratings was the fact that local UPN affiliate stations were delaying the shows scheduled time to air local basketball games. Most of the country couldnt watch UPN anyway without wrapping foil around their TV antennae. And the ones that actually had good reception could never figure out when the damn show was on because their local UPN station kept changing the air time.The reason that season  was so good was not only because of Coto and the ReevesStevens though they were the major reason but also because they show was already cancelled at that point. The network was absent from season  because they just didnt give a fuck anymore. Thus the Trek crew actually got to have a lot of freedom there at the end.Berman and Braga had a lot of problems. But they werent the sole reason Enterprise was cancelled.,startrek,d4okhu1,1,t5_2qixm

But they equally demonstrate that there are more complicated things going on as is so often the case with genetics.There is no reason to assume the closet is the best explanation when we have plenty of perfectly valid ones. Sulu and PrimeSulu are at most on the level of monozygotic twins.

8281391,0,t1_d5cn0cv,gt Cadet Kirk gets command of an advanced starship.Yeah that really bugged me.  Heres how I mentally retconned it Kirk actually got a direct commission because he had experience on civilian starships when Pike tracked him down.  He was in an advanced command program at Starfleet Academy rather than officer basic training and his rank of Cadet was a product of the training environment while he was really a LT at the time of the movie.  This also explains why McCoy is at the academy  For some specialized deepspace medical training.  Because the Enterprise didnt have a ships manifest yet she was running with a skeleton crew and they were pulling in cadets to run things.  All other real officers were specialiststechnicians or also cadets without any command experience or training while Kirk had at least some and was therefore the best choice.  Not a perfect retcon by any means but it gives me a little internal consistency even though its just because J.J. Abrams doesnt care about plot holes.,startrek,d5cqec3,7,t5_2qixm

8283928,0,t1_d5cye4t,Sorry have to reply to this apologies for the rant coming in ...   The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.    Khan Noonien Singh  has history with TOS Kirk in the TV show and  years later he hates Kirk for the deaths of his people.  The Death of Spock James Kirk  Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner had played these characters for  years a long time Spock showed Kirk that the only way to beat the no win situation is thru self sacrifice forcing Kirk to face death finally! They earned that death scene.  NuTrek  two whole films plus he barely died for  minutes forcing Spock to go beat up NuKahn to deal with his grief whereas in WoK everybody thought Spock was dead until the next film was titled In search of Spock.  Carol Marcus In WoK she showed Kirk the life he might have had in ID she showed Kirk her bra and panties.  The theme in Wrath is aging dying and death.The theme in ID is that JJ might have heard about science  once no its Tribbles are space labrats no its Kirk loses more crew than in  years of Trek no Spock learns its ok to phone old Spock on a whim.    So yea Into Darkness isnt a retelling of Wrath but it distills the best Trek of that film and shoves it into its own mega blockbuster summer scifi extravaganza and explains why Trek nerds are pissed off about it.

He says For all we know at this very moment somewhere far beyond all those distant stars Benny Russell is dreaming of us. That really speaks to me.

We dont know the composition of the crew we dont know the timeline its being set inother than prime universe. All we have is a delta winged ship design that looks vaguely Klingon and vaguely Star Fleet. While this sub has a tendency to knee jerk this is getting out of hand people need to take a step back and breath. Look at this objectively were truly sailing into the unknown. Thats what Star Trek is all about and since when have Star Trek ships ever had to look always pretty? Is their some sort of canon requirement that says a ship cant look dominating and menacing?  I think the general assumption now is that its designed by the Klingons and Federation and its not like Fuller doesnt know what hes doing Im sure the ship will be explained in the plot. This was a first look. It never said teaser anywhere in the title and people are flipping their shit going all drama on it like its the end of the world remember how the first trailer made beyond look like and now everyone loves it and they already said the ship isnt a final design. Top it all off Voyager changed its design last minute and I for one hope that they dont change the ship design if it fits into the plot or Canon somehow. ,startrek,d5q5573,9,t5_2qixm

My closest assumption would be after The Undiscovered Country around the years  based on this timeline I like to think this is based on the Phase II Enterprise design which was intended to be for The Motion Picture but due to the design implications I expect they decided to push that ahead. It looks like they brought up Ralph McQuarries deltawing concept which I strangely like   as it has a less polished look but makes my expectations for Discovery to be a little more gritty similar to Battlestar Galactica and not so Roddenberry Utopianesque. Others Concept  Concept  Concept To be frank Ive never really liked the perfect society of Roddenberry no racism poverty war etc as weve seen plenty of greed war and hypocrisy in Starfleet and the Star Trek Universe while having crew explain how Earth has developed and evolved beyond these things.

8477235,0,t3_4vrzbp,I recall very well watching it and thinking the show wouldnt last. You know how everyone knocks TMP as being slow paced and dull? Encounter at Farpoint was that to me. From the start the show started off with a slow pan up to the new ship the new Captain steps out of the shadows with a slow monologue and tour of this fancy new looking ship and everyone looking relaxed and happy.  This was in stark contrast to what I was used to with TOS which from episode  threw us right into the mission and quickly moved forward with a sense of tense uncertainty.  Familiar RoddenberryFontana tropes were present and welcome but they seemed skewed or subdued  the typical Godlike entity was there but he didnt seem particularly threatening or intelligent just wanting to have a rather superficial debate about the ills of humanity even though there are many nonhuman members of the Enterprise and the Federation.... The bewilderedlooking elderly Captain surrendered his ship on his first outing and once they did finally make it to Farpoint they slowly unraveled the mystery with the help of poor Marina Sirtis in a gogo skirt screaming PAAAAIN!That being said the effects and exterior shots looked REALLY good  way better than anything else on TV at the time and the promisehope of expanding on the Star Trek lore kept me watching.

8499209,0,t3_4w3qdv,For me TOS is pure nostalgia.  Its the groundwork from which all other series are obviously built from.  It isnt the finest Trek but it certainly is the most important of all the series.TNG as others have said is the finest TV incarnation of Trek.  It built on TOS but reached new heights.  DS is my personal favorite.  While I can clearly see why TNG is favored over DS DS suceeded in taking Trek in a new direction making it darker and edgier.  My favorite episodes of any Star Trek are from DS with the exception of The Inner Light.VOY is a less successful continuation of TNG.  I feel as though VOY tried to redo TNG albeit less successfully.  They would occasionally capitalize on the Borg to boost ratings.  To be honest they are the only VOY episodes that entertain me.To answer your question ENT is the most divisive.

The initial trailer was poor and the final trailer gave away a pivotal plot point reveal  add all this to the fact that Paramount seemed to be strangely silent on the film and it all added up towards disappointment there was just no buzz generated around the film.The fact that  is the th anniversary of Star Trek would make you think youre on to winner and that perhaps was part of the problem theyre facing now  Paramount never seemed to show any interest in the  years of history that came before it.

The NX class was cool looking but definitely felt like a huge step behind the Constitution class.The problem with the NX is though the hull shape and linework its clearly a th century ship with old nacelles on it.Ive seen some fan designs that are much better and much more fit into the TOS aesthetic while keeping the general idea of the NX. I agree with the NX shouldnt be smooth like TOS era but I would have liked a TOS shaped hull and line work but not the nice greywhite colour but silver and shit just hanging off it like phaser banks torpedo launchers satellites etc.The new Archer class ship is what the NX should have looked like more IMO.,startrek,d7atuzy,1,t5_2qixm

8887768,0,t3_51zmxk,Great question!Im sure others will chime in and help me here but from my perspective each series offers something unique. The Original Series was great because it was new and exciting at the time. Its been likened to a Western in space which admittedly isnt unfounded. Great fun but campy. The Next Generation is fantastic in advocating for different approaches to resolve conflict without violence. Its my favorite and can be very heavy on diplomacy and cultural understanding at times. Voyager can be a lot of fun because its the first instance of a starship captain not being a male. Capt. Janeway is fantastic for a lot of folks for others shes hit or miss. Like TNG it tends to be very episodic especially in the initial seasons. Deep Space  is great if youre into darker themes and political intrigue. Assassination terrorism those are found through the series. The guys who worked on DS laid the groundwork for a much more gritty show in the Battlestar Galactica remake. Great show with lots to offer. Enterprise is a neat series in that it provides a lot of background info to how the Federation came to be. A lot of Trekkies have issues with some of the canon inconsistencies but if you approach it as a standalone series it can be fun to watch. As for the movies the only suggestion I would have is dont watch any of the movies with The Next Generation crew until youve seen some if not all of the series. Otherwise youll miss a lot of those inside jokesconnections. I know that was super broad but hopefully that helps somewhat!,startrek,d7g6myf,8,t5_2qixm

Theyve even changed the definition of words to allow black racists to generalize and discriminate against Whites without actually being called racist.

Still totally watchable. Nemesis Good parts in an overall depressing and drab movie. DS Im currently watching this for the first time. Season  starts getting watchable and season  has been badass. Still not totally sold on all the characters but the ideas and stories are really different and fun avenues for exploration. Voyager Gets better the more you watch it. Especially backtoback episodes.

She thought it was the best Trek film.On the big screen wow. Shots of starships passing by really feel so much more significant. Reliant towering over the audience was something else. It shows that a short  second shot in a Trek film can really invoke a sense of dread. Of course the nebula battle stood out as a feeling so much more grand. Those microtransactions in Kirks strategy feel so much more significant.Now I cried like a baby when Data died in Nemesis but this was the first time Spocks death rattled me. I do think as OP said that it has to do with Nimoys passing. Seeing For The Love of Spock last week only added to that feeling.

And note that the glottal stop apostrophe is a consonant not punctuation.

I also suspect there will be more coming from their spin room now that Fuller has spoken publicly and countered CBS false claim that he is still actively involved.What we do know is this Bryan Fuller is a television auteur who took time out from an already packed schedule to go back to his dream job at CBS request. He did not wish to rush bringing Star Trek back to television after it had been banished to the land of wind and ghosts and JJ Abrams for over ten years. He wanted to get it right for a network which claimed it wanted to be in the prestige television business on streaming.By contrast behind door  CBS is a network built on geriatrics reality TV sitcoms and stuffy aging procedurals you can print by the dozen which now expects people to pay for commercials on an allnew pay streaming service and has made its fortune by never rocking the boat or straying too far from the aegis of NCIS The Big Bang Theory Criminal Minds and Big Brother. And multiple reports have said there was tension BTS about Fullers careful handling of the show vs. CBS accelerated timetable for their pointless new service and its launch.If you choose to buy into a prepackaged narrative of your own creation in which Flaky Creator Cant Get the Job Done go ahead. I suspect Les Moonves will back you up on that within  hours. Me I go with quality over quantity.,startrek,daq0wg7,1,t5_2qixm

9878032,0,t1_dav4aqe,Yes its a reference to both the Wrath of Khan and Bryan Fullers exit from the show. Fuller is Spock in this metaphor. As much as I cannot believe I need to point this out you may recall Spock was deceased at the time.Youre being stubborn about this because youve made this personal and you consider any and all cynicism about CBS handling of this situation and DSC to be tantamount to extreme negativity about DSC and Trek in general. Its not. Its just calling this situation what it is which is shitty and full of PR bullshit from the network. Many of us want DSC to do well myself included. I have a lot of hope for the show succeeding based on Fullers vision and the great team he left in place. But I can also call out an obvious dodge by a controlling network when I see it in print and backed up by substantial evidence from the other parties involved. I can find that situation shitty and underhanded and still feel hopeful about Star Trek Discovery.In other words I can walk and chew gum at the same time. You should try it.

9892034,0,t3_5h024s,If I were seeding a baseball tournament with Startrek franchises I think Id go with the following. DS  the only team with any actual experience playing.  Current record  but still held the Logicians to  runs If theyd been human we wouldve held them to five.  One of the first teams to show any sort of meaningful continuity between atbats.. TNG  early scouting reports that despite not having the heart necessary for baseball Data is an effective pitcher.  However they have a weaker outfield in players like the Crushers Troi and Barclay.  Guinan is a surprisingly good coach.  Picard is upset at the stadium lighting insisting they were promised five lights but there are only four.. ENT  a young fit crew still familiar with what would be an ancient sport to the other crews.  Their unique playing style will be the origin of many new rules and strategies used in future games.. VOY  The Voyager crew has the most dedication out of all the teams.  Despite getting lost en route the team overcame vehicle breakdowns and is determined to compete.  Theyve even added two hitchhikers to their roster.. TOS  Their playing style is old and traditional.  But if the benches clear for a brawl TOS will hold their own.  Despite a slumping performance as of late their fanbase is loyal and provides a loud enthusiastic cheering section.. Kelvin  The team that showed up in the fanciest bus wears the shiniest uniforms and looks great posing with fans.  Theyre a favorite among the younger fans but still have a lot to prove on the field.,startrek,dawyega,2,t5_2qixm

Continuity is barely present on most of them and character growth is kept to a bare minimum. But DS was normally so much better about that than the rest of them.

10039564,0,t3_5jfplx,Its not horrible but it had a lot of wasted potential.  Instead of taking the interesting premise it had and making it a unique show based on that it basically turned into a rehash of TNG but with less interesting characters exceptions being The Doctor and Seven of Nine and not as good writing.  We see very little in the way of tensions between Starfleet and the Maquis very little in the way of them struggling to survive in a foreign environment etc.  And another problem I had is that when those things do pop up you know itll be resolved at the end of the episode or the next episode if its a parter with everyone acting like it never happened in the next one with the exception of the Kazon arc.  Theres no tension at all in the show like DS managed to develop with their long story arcs and very little character development outside of The Doctor and Seven.

Halfway through DSs last season I stopped watching it abandoned humanism for the supernatural Ive struggled several times to get through Voyager and I dont think Ive ever made it through a whole episode of ENT.

10307583,0,t1_dcceged,Venezuela would certainly claim socialism N. Korea calls themselves a democratic republic But we call them communists. My point though is this no two governments are the same. Theyre all unique. The US a capitalist nation has many many socialist policies in place. However we are still called capitalist. Socialdemocracy is just a nice buzzword for a socialist country whos officials are elected democratically. These words are defined by how we choose to use them. There is no officialdefinition.It all has to do with what a society considers to be ethical. On one hand you have the utilitarian perspective or in Trek terms the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Socialism leans toward utilitarian ethics. On the other hand is Star Trek s mantra the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many. From this perspective the needs of the individual are paramount. All choices must be voluntary. Any force or mandate on the individual to decide for him is wrong because it wasnt his choice. Voluntary association is more of a libertarian ethic and is more aligned with capitalism.So which one is right? Both and neither. One ethics system is not enough to apply unilaterally across the board. With every unique situation we must chose the proper course of action. ,startrek,dccf4sv,1,t5_2qixm

10572714,1,t1_dd6h6j1,Here are some things that are probably worth keeping in mind when reacting to my vocal online minority thing. Star Trek has a very very deeply entrenched core fanbase. Not only that but it is a fanbase that has largely like most other deeply entrenched fandoms existed in rather isolated online communities like this one. It is easy to think that the opinions whether you agree with them or not you see on these forums are representative of the views and opinions of the much larger much less active casual fanbase.   Now when I say casual fanbase I mean the people who may love Star trek but dont really get wrapped up in the online discussions or even actively seek out the early early news releases that you might frequently see here. These are the majority and while that may kinda piss off us core fans who have eaten breathed and lived this stuff it is how it is.   It has always been this way in the online Star trek community. Back in the days where Trekweb and TrekBBS dominated there were constant and fervent complaints about the design of ships like the NX. You had people who would say Why cant Paramount see that nobody wants the Akiraprise! The same happened with the reboot films. Fans on these boards went nuts about various visual elements casting and even the basic tone but in the end they were but a drop in the figurative bucket as far as market demographics go and the larger casual Trek fan audience still went and saw the films and even enjoyed them.  This subreddit is chocked full of very opinionated very devoted fans who all have their own very specific and sometimes reasonable sometimes unreasonable expectations about any new show or film and every small detail about them. CBS wont care. CBS has teams of marketing experts who would be quick to step in if the majority of viewers hated the design outright. Since the design is still largely unchanged after the initial reveal I think it is safe to say that the silent majority has remained silent as always.   Now I think you should probably reread what I said. I did not say that I speak for the majority. Not at all not even a little bit. What I said is that I am glad that CBS and the production team went with a design that is unpopular with a rather loud group of fans who dont really speak for the majority of Trek fans in the grand scheme of things.   Think about it this subreddit has about  users even if more than half of them hated the design with the passion of a thousand suns they would still not be even close to enough to actually say that nobody likes the design as I have see said largely unchallenged on this subreddit.   I can see how people may take what I said personally but the opinions of the devoted online fan community are not really representative of the majority of casual fans who will tune in to the show.   ,startrek,dd6hqz6,-1,t5_2qixm
10575785,0,t1_dd5sedi,Better fix would be to say that it wasnt a test at all.

They almost always vote against non cisgender rights. They almost always vote against environmentalism which almost always effects those with less wealth the hardest.

Also the Mirror universe eps were funtheres always episodes that let the actors play against type and most had fun with it.

Bye.gtWhy of course the people dont want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally the common people dont want war neither in Russia nor in England nor in America nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.  Gilbert There is one difference. In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.  Gring Oh that is all well and good but voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

10877125,0,t3_5vgbqf,The whole deaging thing only occurred under specific circumstances in a transporter accident. Recreating the exact transporter anomaly could very well be difficult and extremely risky for the participants. Whos to say that the next people to try it wont materialize inside out and then explode? There would also be the question of what long term effects this would have even if the procedure was successful. The people involved in the accident didnt stay children for very long. For all you know their DNA may start disintegrating after a few weeks or something like that. Point is it was a weird transporter accident that would require years of study and experimentation before it could be considered a reliable means to immortality and thats putting aside the ethical and practical considerations of having an immortal population. ,startrek,de1wc7r,8,t5_2qixm
10879903,0,t3_5vdhqf,My biggest fear is that the prequel aspect of the show will be a hindrance rather than an asset. Im worried that the setting will back the writers into a corner and limit creativity in the long term.Enterprise managed to swerve this issue to a great extent by giving itself a buffer zone of roughly  years before TOS thus granting the show a rather substantial amount of creative freedom both in terms of the aesthetic and the stories it wished to tell. The time period was almost completely unknown to the audience giving the show a great blank canvas to work on. With Discovery being set so very very close to TOS or even at the same time if we include The Cage the show doesnt have anywhere near that same freedom. The setting will carry certain expectations from both the aesthetic and storytelling and any deviations from that will undoubtedly cause frustration from some quarters of the fan base.So we have a show that either has to toe the line and play it safe working within those confines set by its time period or a show that breaks free from those constraints and risks alienating those very fans its aimed at.Im desperately trying to keep an open mind and I do wish to be proven wrong but I am yet to see a single reason as to why the setting is a good idea. Ive not seen any convincing arguments as to why this setting will work better than one far in the future. I understand that some feel that technology had advanced too far by the end of Voyager but these are minor things that could be explained and worked around with good storytelling. Theres an entire universe worth of stories out there so why restrict ourselves to such a small welltrodden corner of it? ,startrek,de26nce,2,t5_2qixm

Im pretty sure Quark and Sisko didnt strip search her. In the first season of TNG theyve got phasers smaller than a remote control and they seem more powerful than what the Vorta had. As for why it wasnt standard issue I guess I really wouldnt see the point. The Vorta are rarely seen without the JemHadar present.

10988222,0,t1_debzy06,I will open by correcting my previous post. I miscopied the wrong number from your lower post. I mentioned x as K while I should have said .Does this resolve your issue with my post?I agree with most of what youre saying. Its not news to me. The only issue I have with your post is the suggestion that a  video with the same height as K resolution isnt a K video. But you acknowledge that a  video in p is still p. You seem to suggest that the actual height of a p because  is the height or width of a K because  is the width of the video defines whether it is in fact p or K. I respectfully disagree. I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that the absolute resolution of the p  video is not x. But Im not talking about the technical definition of the word resolution or the use of K as a number. Im talking about the video industry terminology that basically uses K or p as the NAME of the resolution for any video that hits EITHER the full height or full width of that resolution that name originates from the number of pixels but it isnt an absolute reference to how much of the width or height of that frame is actually used. In other words any video that has  pixels of height doesnt need to be upscaled to fit on a p screen even if it isnt full width. They still call that a p video. For example  of films are wider than  so they do NOT reach  vertical pixels of video image. But they do hit the  width of the p resolution. These are still considered p quality videos.The bottom line that Im saying is that the resolution of a video product like this is basically a reference to the density of its pixels  the DPI if you will. p is not not a guarantee that you have the full x pixels of visual information. It just means that EITHER a widescreen  or wider video will be  pixels wide OR anything less than widescreen  or narrower will be  pixels high. Only an actual  video will reach both the horizontal and vertical limits of the resolution. TNG blue rays ARE p but they are only x pixels At least thats what I calculate based on the math. The point of calling it p is to say that the  image area of the screen has the same pixel density as the middle part of a  image that is x.Similarly a  image in K may not have  pixels of width but the  area of image will have the same equivalent pixel density as the middle area of a a  K video. The  image WILL have the same vertical resolution of  pixels but only  wide. Its still K resolution. That doesnt make it K resolution because the resolution is defined by both dimensions. If you had a K TV it would not have enough vertical pixels to display  K image.This all comes down to the fact that weve pigeonholed resolutions being standardized into a  ratio. So all of the defined resolutions are set in that ratio but the bottom line is if the video will natively fill a K screen with the appropriate letterboxing on EITHER the vertical or horizontal dimension or if it has to be upscaledstretched to fill the screen.Ive probably repeated myself a few times so sorry about that.,startrek,dedhaq4,0,t5_2qixm

Its still glitchy when the driver switches tracking from one camera to another room scale is smaller and has issues all the USB cables etc.Vive weight is now down to match the Rift doesnt have near the God rays or other visual artifacts that the Rift does and has a display three times brighter measured and still much dimmer than just going outside but makes everything look much better than in the Rift.The best thing to do though is to try both for yourself and make your own decision. People like the Rift until they try the Vive and room scale. And if you want to wait for gen  there are some really cool things coming to the Vive and that whole ecosystem is expanding with other manufacturers signing onto the Valve tracking system. Rifts Constellation is turning into a dead end though Heaney will go on about computer vision which the Rift tracking isnt.

That someone has somehow managed to negate this fact in The Expanses universe and constructed the first feasible stealth ships is an utter revolution in military affairs.And for even less you could destroy every last one of them.,startrek,dg8cder,3,t5_2qixm

Every time a clip of Beyond played th anniversary shouldve been included somewhere. This shouldve been a nobrainer.And its SO bizarre because clearly the entire reason the fought tooth and nail to even get Beyond out in  was to coincide with the th anniversary but then they did absolutely nothing to remind people of that. I will never get it. I dont think any of us will. And sadly Beyond bombed at the box office. The only good Star Trek to do that....on its th anniversary.

It takes its time to get going into the overarching story the budget is really low and some of the acting isnt the best early on but after watching  seasons of it and all the beautiful writing the whole way through the chemistry amp history between all the characters I cried for two hours after the final episode.. and before that it was ds that was responsible for my worst bawling ever.

11801925,0,t3_68d4pq,The Borg originally worked so well because they were used infrequently on TNG. Even then with I Borg and Descent the writers were creating a group outside of the main collective in order to further explore humanity.The main Borg collective were only used properly in Q Who and Best of Both Worlds.  This meant that when we next saw them in First Contact there was still a menace about them and an unknown.   Hell they were still able to get to heart of the Federation and it took a fleet of the newest starships Starfleet could muster to take out one cube.Voyager on the other hand used the Borg so frequently and the ship took no damage that any encouter with them was without risk. They were able to negotiate an alliance with the Borg!Yes some scenes were visually stunning and there were a couple of excellent episodes around the Borg.  Seven was also a relevation some of the best character development in Voyager  shame most of the other main characters were the same in Endgame as they were in Caretaker!.Voyager had many problems over the years one of which was the writers inability to come up with a significant villain race.
