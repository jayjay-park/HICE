7549186,0,t3_4ipuxv,I still prefer Talisman for the early goldcdrregen and later team engage. Targons Brace is a pathetic upgrade and Kindlegems upgrade cost vs stats is still a joke starting coin had always resulted in smoother early game for me.New Taric probably fucked this up because his costs are so high but you spam so much less. I used to StunTapShatterTapCtrl and walk back into the brush so I needed that mana regen. Now hes just a shittier Bard and I guess you get to proc Relic Shield because you have fuckall else to do in lane now.,taricmains,d30b174,2,t5_38ph0
7942937,0,t3_4nuu0e,It is busted and Riot is promising a change for supports in an upcoming patch. But for now the best way to get an S on support is to steal kills. Tarics damage is super low but if you time your E stun right off the engage jungler you can pick up a kill or two accidentally that way ,taricmains,d48uz79,2,t5_38ph0

11090498,0,t1_deo8iie,Cinderhulk was better when tarics heal was HP based so he could heal himself for TONs of HP.,taricmains,dep3jyc,1,t5_38ph0
11635309,0,t3_65zlku,Pray and hope u guys can get thru laning phaselol.But if u dont want that u can take ignite with  into grasp.... tell draven to all in lulu lvl ... but really its just up to that lulu player... and also taric is so fun if paired with strong early adc like lucian so draven pick is like...  into cait and lulu no less,taricmains,dgevihk,2,t5_38ph0
