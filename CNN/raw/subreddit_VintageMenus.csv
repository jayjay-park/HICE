These meals could knock the socks off some regular meals served at home in the States these days.Its interesting that sometimes dinner meat was served cold and sometimes it and fish was served heated. I dont think Ive ever enjoyed cold meat for dinner perhaps I should try it.The meals dont necessarily go to the meatandthreeveg standard that the Brits and the Americans became known for. There are interesting variations and I read that puddings and cheese were common. I guess thats the same as completing a meal in American with pie or ice cream or whatnot.Some seafoodandmeat combo plates.Arrowroot blancmange rice capers  just a few ingredients that suggest that life wasnt all Oliver Twiststyle porridge after the writing of Charles Dickens. But then perhaps that this set of menus was printed meant that the people consuming this publication could afford better. Otherwise one imagines that these ingredients were common enough.That pea soup with pork liquid sounds good enough to stop me. That broiled herring with mustard sauce has me howling.Rabbit is really underrated in the USA these days. I was once fortunate enough to dine in a foreign military chow hall  and it probably saving money  had its cooks catch and skin rabbit. They were chopped up and cooked up sort of like American chicken wings. ,VintageMenus,ddd44cu,9,t5_3fk9a
