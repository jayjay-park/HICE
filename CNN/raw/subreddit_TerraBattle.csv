It has worked  for me so far but still annoying to set it up each time.Still I really suggest you contact support AND TELL THEM YOU LIVE IN FREAKING CANADA.

2769943,0,t1_cniwn4u,gt Do you have any numbers to support the fact that MZ is not very efficient in comparison for MZ even for level ? Ive suspected the same. Its less pertinent to this topic but if you have a level  AoE clearer its not worth running MZ.  If youre still mid level and dont have a good AoE clearer or someone at least Lv  then MZ can definitely be worth it.  I got a bit off topic with the last post.At Difficulty  for MZ base XP per metal enemy is  XP  At Difficulty  for MZ base XP per metal enemy is  XP.  If you assume that the number of mobs that spawn is about the same etc the base XP per stamina is about  for MZ and  for MZ.  So MZ wins.  If youre running All Hail the King the king has one more enemy in MZ so its a bit more favorable for MZ if you chain kill everything you get another  XP bonus on the king worth about  of base XP plus another enemy to kill worth about  of base XP.  Of course if you arent using a Lv clearer to level then MZ can be worth it if you have trouble pushing the difficulty of MZ to .gtSimilar question here. MZ is only  more stamina than . Unless my memory serves me wrong the quoted number for exp in  is k and only if you chain everything together. I found that on some runs it was less than k again my memory might be wrong.gtgtSuppose that MZ is the same exp as  even without the King. Some people take  minutes to do  but the average good time seems to be  minutes.gtgtI guess it depends on how much your time is worth. In my view it might be worth spending  extra stamina to run MZ and save yourself time. It depends on how much your time is worth and how much the drops Animaton Dark Matter Oxsecium Moon Tear  coins is worth and how much your time is worth.

PaD has more characters and a greater variety of characters. I love the entire character aspect of it however the actual gameplay isnt especially fun. There is little to no tactical element or difference between the fights it is just match  or more in as many combinations as possible every level.

Keep the Kuscah as your healer he can handle most of the content in game. He should be able to carry you through the story. if you have bahlone of the best dps characters in the game you can start building up a sword team. Kapori a common pull would be a great addition if you decide to build a sword team as he has negateaugment circle which pretty much takes you out of the circle of carnageyou do more damage to other weapons they do normal damage to you.Edit If you decide to reroll make sure you take press change device and take down your info. An SS or Z mage would be best but this guy is one of the hardest characters to completely maxout starting from his nonz form.nd edit Rerolling really isnt necessary I started with Eileen and Daianna and I now have just about everything and completed just about everything starting with a Z lambda character is a great luxury to have.rd edit Against the current final boss on on normal mode if you max out Bahls . stack times you get at least over k in damage against the boss which is about  his health by done by Bahl alone on her second pincer. This without her other buff Otomos and without augment circle. I used an older damage formula and rounded some numbers but it should be around k. ,TerraBattle,cvprun3,1,t5_33ih6

7817964,0,t3_4mdfnv,Camellia is a more niche character. She might be getting a recode soon but as of right this second shes a niche okaydamage character. She depends on having male characters on your party to maximize her dps and will most likely be traded out for a more rounded out character as you play the game if you choose to keep her. The Terra Battle tier list in game is actually decently accurate. S is worse than SS and Zs are almost always worth keeping. Maybe a side note would be the DPS trinity Macuri Bahl and Snaip who are below S level but they have some of the highest none Z physical attack output in the game I believe. To be frank some people re roll until they can get a Z character. But you can beat the game on all S and AB characters. I see this game as more of a character collecting puzzle game. But if you really want to re roll any of the Z mages even in their SS form are worth it imo. I personally love Rejin Z Samantha Z and Ami Z. I also have a partial favoritism to Yukken Z because she was the first character I ever recoded. All in all remember its a game and you should play for fun! Minimizing and maximizing is fun but I dont think thats a giant part of this game. Happy gaming,TerraBattle,d3usyau,2,t5_33ih6

The L PoFoF adventurers also enable you to run many of the Daily events with L and get monsters and O II companions which sell for significant coins.    I typically advise people to either pull until they have  total characters including Palpa and Bagunar or pull a  event once before clearing PoF so there is a little risk of getting an adventurer you could have obtained with coins but I dont think its practical to not do any pulls until after clearing PoF because you wont have many characters to use and you miss out on the ability to do other events.,TerraBattle,dc8s2s8,1,t5_33ih6

If you purely mean storywise it is but it gets extremely hard at some point if you dont know what to expect the game is admittedly actually very hard for a lot of people that are overwhelmed with what may at first seem complicated mechanics but its actually quite simple once you understand. I think most people will end up doing it anyway after realising that with some little dedication doing Attack of the Coins Creeps on weekends or during half stamina arena events will clear it relatively quickly and the benefits of having done so is very apparent youll realise once you get to the part of recoding adventurers. The more hardcore bunch wont actually progress until a certain point of story content to keep two certain stages locked into Hard Mode for farming purposes but its probably not relevant to you since it involves pretty extreme farming.,TerraBattle,dfjssb5,1,t5_33ih6
