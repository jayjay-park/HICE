423115,0,t3_1yx442,Its generally been considered cheaper and easier to build these using rods. But you can  and some have  cut a disc out of sheet metal as well as made a cone out of sheet metal assembled and voila.Advantages? maybe mechanical  to a point snicker But really  its not much. If your interest is in the higher freqs it may be some what easier to assemble a smaller discone using sheet. But for lower freqs the traditional rod method really is best. If you feel you really have to go for smoke you can add ribs n rings to a discone ring is a circular conductor joining the ends of each rod both disc and cone  think hem of a skirt. Ribs same idea just join the rods at various levels in parallel.. But mostly thats for show  except rare special situations.

721164,0,t3_22c5w3,Hi  To build a upconverter you need two basic parts a RF Mixer and a RF Oscillator.  Have a lots of types of RF Mixer chips like SANE or diode rings like ADE.  But can build using discrete parts diodes or transistors.   RF Oscillator can be discrete crystal circuit or a Oscillator Chip on a rectangular metal box.  You can find both on salvaged electronics devices. Like radios mixer network interfaces oscillator.  And other parts too.  Oscillator frequency need to be above minimum tunable frequency of tuner chip on rtl dongle. MHz to RT and MHZ to E. MHz or MHz are used on ethernet cards NIC.  I build one using FM front end mixer used on FM radios and MHz oscillator from NIC.  My project can be download from   This  have a collections of upconvertes.  And even need PCB many build circuits using only parts leads as support and solder join.  Its is my upconverter on idea test stage   ,RTLSDR,cgm8zxq,1,t5_2tr68
762012,0,t3_22thuc,Id disable squelch too.  And just mute the virtual audio cables output in the sound mixer if you dont want to listen. I have mine muted and running all the time in the background.Your results are what mine looked like when I first found the local pager network frequency... It was total garbage. But once I put the dongles antenna on the windowsill and got all the settings zeroed in its been at  ever since.  But then here its at .MHz so its probably an easier signal to receive with the stock antenna.,RTLSDR,cgqwang,1,t5_2tr68
762449,0,t3_22vu9v,Moderately narrowband but directional.  The former means you have gain only at a fairly narrow range of frequencies as youve observed.The latter means you have to point it exactly at the transmitter of interest  at azimuthal angles other than that particular direction the gain will be low even less than  dB or gain of .If thats OK great.  Again usually you want  broadwide band frequency coverage and  omnidirectional gain all directions because as you tune through the whole range of the RTLSDR you have no idea what frequency or direction from which the signal will be ahead of time.  This is why discones and biconicals are the ideal choice most of the time.  They dont have crazy high gain but they have good gain which is better than the small default antenna that comes with an RTLSDR dongle and thats enough usually to give you enough signal for it.  And they are omnidirectional in the plane of the Earth which fits with the lineofsight of VHF and UHF the primary bands of the RTLSDR.,RTLSDR,cgqy30a,1,t5_2tr68
845960,0,t1_ch031m2,Hmm yes I just went and listened to the packet you recorded.  You can tell that the sound changes significantly about halfway through the packet.  I think you can see it on the waterfall too that rising noise sound is probably? the pattern that looks like tire tracks running horizontally across the end of the packet.

878327,0,t1_ch40m7o,Electrically those are loading coils which actually hurt the gain to get a better impedance match on a too short antenna.,RTLSDR,ch44b16,2,t5_2tr68
887432,0,t1_ch52k3p,I dont understand why you would want to use a vertical beam for ADSB. because aircraft with ADSB are all around you and the problematic signals are at the horizon so what you want is a high gain omnidirectional antenna that allows you to receive signals from long distances away that are basically all within just one or two degrees of the horizon. Youre also trying to receive vertically polarized signals. Not horizontal TV antennas are designed for TV band horizontal reception. Perhaps when you built the coaxial? collinear you had the velocity factor wrong. Velocity factor for various  ohm coax varies over a fairly wide range. The way to test it for your particular cable is to build a quarter wave stub and measure where the null occurs with a signal source like a diode noise bridge.Have you ever seen these PCB LPDAs? If you want a directional antenna buy one premade.The long and the short of it for the TV antennas is  its unlikely to work even in a half assed way because the mast will detune the antenna its not designed to be a broadband vertical antenna. Also it will be mechanically unstable. Perhaps even dangerous.You should look at something like the below perhaps. Also its cheap. To avoid the problem above the only way to do it well with large Yagis is to use two identical antennas one on each end of a boom in an H sort of with the mast and rotator in the middle. Using a phasing harness.,RTLSDR,ch55kav,1,t5_2tr68

1874075,0,t3_2g2ht3,It seems to me like the librtlsdr mod only reliably seems to extend the USABLE lower tuning level down to around  MHz and between  and  MHz the tuning is erratic. Some people have received extremely strong signals below that range as low as  MHz by turning the Rf gain way up but its not really receiving its like trying to listen to people on the other side of a thick concrete wall.. Its not going to be useful..For  Mhz it works but its much less predictable and that makes it not as useful as one would hope however it does work. the tuning ends at around  Mhz which unfortunately is still around a MHz shy of the popular  meter ham band. My guess is that given that the device is tuning those freqs there is probably some very simple and fairly noninvasive hardware mod that would take you farther  without the commitment required for irect sampling.. making a direct connection to the I input on the RTL chip  dont do this mod thats shown in this picture unless you know what else you have to do to provide the chip with the right band of frequencies and prevent ESD damage  which ruins the dongle for VHFUHF  is usually what people doAs it is It will let you tune the two highest shortwave bands that are in daily use. during the daytime they are dead at nightits not a great solution. But it does sort of work. And the mod does improve performance in the low part of the RTs range by moving some things around.,RTLSDR,ckf0pjk,1,t5_2tr68

2279653,0,t1_clsq70m,Actually Ive been an RF engineer and public safety radio system architect for about nine years and have designed and commissioned several local and widearea SmartNet multizone Type II Motorola trunked radio systems and have experience with analog digital and ASTRO twoway radio system implementations with mixedmode clear and encrypted talkgroups.So yeah I know more than you. To correct what you said.. no they arent close at all. I have been involved in enduser training and system familiarization with new builds which includes seminars with police. They are told from day one what encryption is and what channels are and are not encrypted. Most police and especially their commanders are quite aware of encryption and know that clear channels can easily be monitored with a TrunkTracker scanner except the newer  baud control channels theyre tougher  and Motorola has the capability of encrypting their control channels now which stops all scanners in their tracksPlus the new line of ASTRO portables will alert the user when they are entering and leaving encrypted channels both with a visual and audible alert. Its a simple matter of programming it into the master codeplug. You dont need special hardware to encrypt or decrypt. You can buy a Motorola Astro Saber III w DESOFB on eBay right now for  and with the right software you can get a radio on any TRS that is encryption capable.But without the encryption key you arent gonna be able to listen into anything encrypted. And since the latest Motorola encryption codes are based on AES you arent gonna stumble across it. And if you do it wont be of much use for long.

This means that no upconverter circuit is required.However the difficulty with direct sampling is that a hardware modification to the dongle is required. Also the performance can not be expected to be as good as an upconverter without the addition of extra filtering circuits.,RTLSDR,cqxty3u,3,t5_2tr68

6258132,0,t3_41a7sm,The easy part about Shazam Im guessing because I havent seen their implementation is you have a library of songs on file you run them through a pattern algorithm to generate a mathematical signature for that song and the phones microphone does the same with the unknown song and then you just look in the database for a matching signature. Youre only dealing with an audio signal you know its gonna be music youre listening to and the scope of the problem is limited and clearly defined.Auto identifying RF signals has many more options so its a more difficult problem.  Looking at the actual content of the signal ie trying to see if the output makes sense is probably too difficult for some modes but may be ok with others eg PSK is conversational so you could do a dictionary match for detecting decode quality while JT or a CW contest may only have callsigns and signal reports which is harder to quantify. You could also do an analysis on the bandwidth and temporal characteristics of the signal to figure out what sort of mode it is likely to be.  CW will be single frequency and high temporal power variance SSB will have kHz bandwidth and be temporally variable while PSK will be temporally power stable and have a narrow bandwidth consisting of  baud symbol rate.Writing all of this into code would be quite some effort though ,RTLSDR,cz0zbsg,5,t5_2tr68

When that happens you get both the positive and negative version of that math. So . gives you .. If you didnt put in the LO offset that is where youd have to tune to hear that same frequency up converted. So your offset is adding  to all the frequencies to give you the real world frequency in your display. But the mixing process also creates .. which will display at .. Usually this half of filtered off but if you have strong signals like FM radio it can still have some strength. The other two signals you will see are the  and . source signals which can also leak through a little giving you response at  and . respectively.Compare the strength of the signals at . . and . when you are in up convert mode with the offset applied and I think you will see some differences.It is working how it should I believe but you should be able to see something in the lower frequencies now.

Merely two metal rodsbarswirespizza pans lets say mm long each with one rod connected to the center of the coax and the other to the shield of the coax for RG this is aluminum and very difficult to solder crimping is recommended and youre off to the races.If youre feeling really cheap just cut mm of the outer plastic layer off the end of some RG and then pull the shield in one direction and the center conductor in another and you also have a dipole.Put in a vertical manner and youll have good coverage of VHF. I typically use spring steel cut up tape measures but copper is better. Id also definitely recommend getting either an MCX to F type or SMA to F type adapter.,RTLSDR,d6f8038,2,t5_2tr68

9219406,0,t1_d8kj04m,If they are using different CTCSS tones the receiver will only output audio if the stronger signal has the same CTCSS channel as the receiver is configured for. Some radios will latch the CTCSS tone presence as long as squelch is present so you can end up with some unexpected and receiver specific behavior when one transmitter turns onoff. ,RTLSDR,d8kml9o,1,t5_2tr68

11268045,0,t3_60sula,gt CB antennaMHz seems to be what you mean by CB in the US but theres MHz CB in other places. If you have the former it might work purely by the fact its a larger antenna even if it is massively out of band. The latter will work very well if thats what you have  a lot of offroaders use  UHF CB antennas around these parts.gt inline preampUnless you have one sitting around Id spend the money on a better antenna even if you make it yourself. If you do have one laying around make sure it covers the MHz range.gt DSDI find it can be very twitchy with DMR try adjusting your levels one way until it starts to drop out then the other until it drops out and set it in the middle of those two points. If youre using SDR or similar also check the received signal strength to see if its any good  using the AGC and preamp settings in the driver may or may not help you.gt PI dont know enough to help you sorry.,RTLSDR,df97sju,3,t5_2tr68
11386220,0,t3_62by2g,Thanks for the replies Im in Australia by the way. We have similar databases to search for towers but theres no doubt that there would be one nearby so dont feel I need to go looking. Its impossible to be certain but I think its interference from appliances next door it comes an go in secondslong bursts across mhz rather than a constant broadcast. Its an outdoor turnstile antenna that I bought from eBay that worked perfectly at the last house. My neighbours are literally two metres away from it with an open kitchen window. I havent bought any new applicances of my own so dont think its me. Also facing the top of the turnstile towards their house blows the spectrum away. My guess is cheap electronics. Im renting so dont have much option about where the antenna can go currently its sitting on a post in my backyard that has decent NS views. Very similar to my previous setup except for the proximity of neighbours. Funnily enough I had excellent reception of Meteor M this morning max elevation of  degrees but still not as good as before. Enough to keep me interested though. Could the airport have anything to do with it? Im really close only a few kilometres. I guess on the flip side aviation channels are five by five.,RTLSDR,dfmlxa0,1,t5_2tr68
