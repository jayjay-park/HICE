4289591,0,t1_cs89x2c,You are right. In the sense that both are drugs they should be treated similarly. Many reservations outlaw alcohol to begin with. But my reasons for upholding the interdict on marijuana is for morality.If the government willing submits even participates in overturning laws and making legal substances that have major potential to harm our people they are in effect saying they approve of that. Much like you I could have gotten any drug  especially alcohol  on the rez without much uproar going down. Problem is making legal doesnt reinforce the notion it can be dangerous.However I should note that I am not completely against marijuana. I recognize that is has medical uses which benefit many including natives. I am OK with that. What I take issue with which I shouldve made more clear in my original comment is the approval of recreational use. That is what puts people at the risk of abusing it. Making it fully legal means that it will be abused even more because now people will change their mentality. Well if our government says it is fine then it must be. Sure they have guidelines and regulations but people disregarded that while it was illegal why listen to them when it is legal now? Not everyone will think like that but as it is evident from experience that is what will happen. Without government disapproval people who avoided marijuana because of fear of consequences will no longer be inclined to feel such a way.I say this because if we do as you and the president say which is treat it like alcohol the same problems we face with the legality of alcohol are what we will face with marijuana.,IndianCountry,cs95psb,2,t5_34kjy
4426287,0,t3_3bomd3,Well shit.  It really had me going then it ended when it got to the really interesting questions!The practice and phenomenon of passing is where the deception lives.  Passing and BlacknessBlacks do not typically have their guard up as to people trying to infiltrate their group and the cultural appropriation they experienced in the th Century is an open secret see the history of rock and roll for starters.  The Black designation in America is one half of the binary racial society that those in power have tried to build protecting White privilige and identity and the raceclassbased labor system established in the colonial era behind race laws such as the onedrop rule which retains its potency today.  Blackness in America was designed by law policy and cultural practice to be an inclusive category that grows in contrast to Whiteness an exclusive category wrapped in privilige and racial purity.  And lets not forget this all occurs in the context of slavery and its long shadow which makes the th Amendment necessary even today.The traditional dynamic of passing as to Blacks and Whites involves people with some degree of Black heritage and a sufficient degree of phenotypical White traits representing themselves as White.  Introspective meditations on Blackness typically contain an assimilative or integrative imperative spoken or assumed.  The thrust is making different looking parts fit into the larger group and there is strength in that.  Expelling component parts?  Not so much.  Racial purist sensibilities in the more extreme forms of Black Power typically express themselves in the form of dominance not expulsion or purgation.Personally I find it facially ridiculous when people who are largely indistinguishable from White are pressured or forced to identify as Black and the racial purist notion that people with White heritage cant identify with to an extent or fuck it maybe even boxcheck that White heritage.America has basically treated Blackness like a kind of prison so its a surprise when someone gets caught breaking in.All of this is why Rachel Dolezal came as a surprise.  Blackness is something that Whites have historically exploited without selfidentifying as such.Passing and IndigeneityBy comparison the Indian category is a creature of federal state and tribal law in addition to informal culture and general practices.  The continued existence of tribal nations creates a racial landscape with a number of exceptions.  Indians get caught between issues of racial identity cultural identity and tribal citizenship.  Thats why Who is an Indian? as a threshold question that seems obvious to some people yes including assholes isnt really all that obvious all the time.Some tribes can formally adopt people making the adoptees whatever internal tribal status is assigned to them.  They cant receive federal services reserved for Indians though because the federal government looks to the tribal identity and imputes a lineal descent requirement of some kind.Other people are like leaves in the wind blown from the tree that was the larger tribal group.  They claim descent from a tribe validly or not and thats their foot in the Indigeneity door.  Some Americans only have a general familial awareness of Native heritage which is again valid or not.  This generally aware group also with their foot in the same door occassionally feels a sense of entitlement as to their territorial holdings in the Americas partially moored in the indigenous claim.Fewer still but enough of these people try to pass for Native which is simultaneously easier and harder to accomplish depending on the kind of passing were talking about.  The federal government is less apt to allow it but thats a narrow area.Indigeneity does not carry the badges and incidents of slavery that Blackness does regardless of the facts that Natives were enslaved and even brokendown into component parts for the Black community through procreation and assimilation.  Indigeneity like Blackness and Whiteness has its advantages making attaining it desirable for some people who try to pass.  Best yet people who pass often get to retain the priviliges of Blackness and Whiteness.  Those who pass often dont marry into the an Indian community and in an ivory tower or political context keep the communities from whom they derive their Indigeneity at arms length.The most pernicious form of this kind of passing is when cultural appropriators take Native resources andor become cultural gatekeepers involved in the business of saying who is Indian who isnt or determining policy related to funds and laws that touch Indian Country and its people.  Im not really in a position to name names it practically merits a casebycase approach.ConclusionsNatives are no strangers to passing as a means of usurping the benefits of Indigeneity but we dont have the same kind of media marketshare population power or representation that Blacks enjoy.Our outrage at the disparity in reactions should be measured but not diluted by these facts.The question I ask is What should be done with the Andrea Smiths of the world?Peoples answer typically betrays whether theyre an isolationist or an expansionist.  If youre an isolationist whos holding onto a notion of cultural and racial purity Ive got to ask is that who your people were traditionally or is your belief postcolonial?  How much of isolationism do you think is part of the federal governments Indian Policy?  Do you think reservations were established so that we would prosper and grow?Being stuck in survival mode for too long is selfdefeating.  If we cant figure out how to use these people yes the Andrea Smiths and Rachel Dolezals for our benefit and appropriately deal with the ones who arent part of the program or refuse to actually assimilate into the community that they profess to be part of then were dead.  This is a cause of death in the same contributory sense of it being one of several shooters simultaneously firing into the still living body of Indian Country.  It might not happen in our lifetime it might have happened long before we were born but it will happen.  And everyone will get their turn.I just think we need to adjust our course aware of where were going with all of this.,IndianCountry,csomigr,6,t5_34kjy

It wasnt thousands of years ago. It was less than  years ago. That invalidates the time portion of your comment. And by the principle of your statement that means the land you andor your family legally own if you own any plots of land property doesnt belong to you regardless if your parents bought it or not.By the principle of your statement that means you dont care that lands were literally stolen from native tribes lands that they lived currently lived on not including the many years they and their ancestors inhabited it. It isnt a care of we lived here then we moved but we still claim it. Natives were still living on those lands when they were stolen from them. When they were killed for it.That is a ludicrous statement if I ever heard one. Of course it was and is our land. It is call an inheritance. You cannot possibly justify the stealing of property and then refusing to give it back because the descendants of the original owners rightfully claim it as their inheritance as it was meant to be according to tradition as morally right. Countries do the same thing today. They claim land that isnt legally theirs because it used to be their land or it currently has their people in that land.,IndianCountry,cvec2om,2,t5_34kjy

5612919,0,t3_3s06a4,Science and MathematicsPreColumbian Americans pursued a detailed understanding the world just as their counterparts elsewhere in the world did. In the Americas the Maya are most famous for their scientific and mathematical efforts. The Long Count calendar requires a detailed understanding of zero as a number something that Mesoamericans realized before Hindu mathematicians introduced the concept to Eurasia. While this calendar may have been created outside of the Maya region the Maya quickly made it their own and employed it thoroughly. Equipped with the Long Count Maya astronomers made precise astronomical observations and were able to calculate the astronomical length of a month and the length  years for Earth Venus and Mars to within mere seconds.  Such precise observations allowed the Maya to devise longrange predictive eclipse charts though given scarcity of surviving Maya codices its unclear if Maya astronomers were able to predict where an eclipse would occur in addition to when it would occur. The Maya werent the only PreColumbian astronomers of course. Archaeoastronomical sites  places where people encoded their knowledge of the sky into their architecture and their art  are commonplace in the Americas though there is often debate to concerning whether the creators of these sites intended these astronomical alignments or if theyre merely coincidental. To find one of the best attested archaeoastronomy sites in the PreColumbian Americas we return to one of my favorite archaeological sites the Newark Earthworks. I mentioned previously possessed an observatory. This structure consists of a acre circular earthen enclosure connected to a acre octagonal enclosure. This structure is believed to be an observatory perhaps in addition to other functions yet unknown is because its major axis aligns with the northernmost rising of the moon one of the eight lunar standstills  points in the moons orbit where it seems to stop as it drifts slowly north and south. The other seven lunar standstills align the other features of the structure including the two tangent lines running corners of the Octagon to the Observatory Circle. The entire lunar standstill cycle occurs once every . years so the Scioto Hopewell who built the structure perhaps  years ago would need have at minimum nearly two decades of astronomical data to build the Observatory Circle and Octagon. More than likely they would have used a larger data set before committing to building such a large structure. Its not clear why the Scioto Hopewell were interested in the lunar standstill cycle but since it is something you need to know in order to predict lunar and solar eclipses their studies may have been a means to that end. The Newark Earthworks also reveals the Scioto Hopewell to have been expert geometers tackling the problem of squaring the circle which vexed ancient mathematicians on the other side of the world. This problem involves creating circles and squares with the same area. As mentioned the Observatory Circles area is  acres which is the same as the Wright Square another portion of the Newark Earthworks. In turn the Squares perimeter is the same as the Great Circles circumference. This along with the order in which these three features were constructed Observatory Circle first Great Circle last indicates that the Scioto Hopewell knew of pi or an analogous mathematical concept. As a final note on the Newark Earthworks To be more specific this basic Scioto unit of distance is known archaeologically as the Observatory Circle Diameter or OCD for short about  feet. More than likely the actual unit was some fraction of this but it was first noticed by archaeologists in relation to the Observatory Circle so the name stuck. Circular enclosures with Observatory Circle Diameters are a common feature of other Hopewell site notably four in the vicinity of Chillicothe Ohio one of which was connected to another though smaller octagonal enclosure with suspected lunar alignments but has seen been destroyed. Throughout the Newark site OCDs were used to construct other features  the Octagon is composed of two squares with sides equal to one OCD the center of the Observatory is six OCDs from the center of the Great Circle as is the center of the Octagon from the center of the Wright Square. ,IndianCountry,cwsu4zm,7,t5_34kjy

While I view social protest as the legitimate expression of political will against social injustice you view it rather cynically as a way of distracting from fundamental political issues. Help me if Im wrong? However the use of detournement by such groups as Ad Busters strikes me as merely elitist social protest. It isnt sign waving or street marching sure but it is antagonistic to the system in a way that is almost entirely intelectual.

9243302,0,t1_d8nmtmz,Haha! Trust me I know how diverse languages can be. We have the same issues here. Even the scripts end up changing. If I travel about kms in any direction I wouldnt be able to communicate with ANYONE! Im actually very curious about American linguistics and have been checking out videos on YouTube about it.Also I forgot to ask earlier has native food been adapted into mainstream America? Im sure native cuisine will be as diverse as the culture itself. And North America being so rich in biodiversity will produce some intense food Im sure. ,IndianCountry,d8nnm5n,2,t5_34kjy

Other than the fact that Native American Mascotry hurts Native kids and a whole host of other reasons this is yet another why it all should go Shitty opposition teams do shitty things in pursuit of their fun and underlying dominance game that make Native Americans so much collateral damage.Let me guess what theyre thinkingIts just sports. orNobody would think Indian is about anything but a football team.Real convincing.,IndianCountry,d9crsvo,8,t5_34kjy

9698458,0,t3_5dztzx,Hey Ani! Thanks for joining us here today it is greatly appreciated. And thank you for lending your husband to us every now and then haha. Ive got a few questions if you dont mind.  How difficult is it to have an established Native presence in the Nations Capital? Do you encounter any opposition or more friends than one might think? What is the general opinion toward you as a Navajo and your group? As in are people surprised to see a community of a more westward tribe in that area? Your opinion on blood quantum? Favorite food?Thanks again for doing this!,IndianCountry,da8ji69,2,t5_34kjy
9802499,0,t3_5fmk78,Thanks for joining us guys! We are happy to have you. To start things off Im curious about how niitsiiosin translates from a traditionally oral language to something written down and recorded with roman letters.

10475781,0,t1_dcvf6tn,A lot of links Ive seen mention barrels and gallons umcrakin.   Significant Pipeline Spills Already This Year Exposes Troubling Safety Record    Years of Oil and Gas Pipeline Accidents Mapped. The sheer number of incidents involving Americas fossil fuel infrastructure suggests environmental concerns should go beyond Standing Rock.  Pipeline spills  gallons of crude into creek about  miles from Dakota Access protest camp.  At least  barrels of crude oil have been spilled in an Amazonian region after leaks from Perus main oil pipeline the state oil company said.The oil has polluted two rivers that at least eight indigenous communities rely on for water the government and indigenous leaders said.  Oil Spills Stain Peruvian Amazon The recent leak of  barrels of oil in Perus Amazon jungle will cause incalculable damage according to scientists  Another Gulf oil spill adds fuel to movement against new offshore drilling leases.Last week a damaged pipeline at a Royal Dutch Shell deepwater production field about  miles off the Louisiana coast spilled whats been officially estimated at  gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before the leak was stopped.Etc etc etc......

10546369,0,t3_5qygcs,I think if that had happened to me in highschool I would have just done my best to do whatever it was they wanted of me so that I could graduate and get out of there.However now that I am an adult I absolutely refuse to ever let anyone treat me that way. I hate confrontation but I am at the point where I would rather say something and deal with the stress of confrontation I get so sweaty and nervous but the more I deal with it the easier it gets.So if you want to deal with potential confrontation I would schedule a meeting with the principalheadmasterperson in charge. I would have a list of all the issues that I have had including the names of the teachers involved. I would also have contacted a civil rights group such as NARF as suggested by another post prior to my meeting. They may even suggest talking to a lawyer. I would then come into my meeting with all of that information to show the principal that their employees are discriminating against me and it will not be tolerated. In many cases the threat of a lawsuit is all that you need for higher ups to put pressure on the faculty. If you want to do this though you need to practice potential conversation pathways so that you come off as professional knowledgable and selfpossessed  as opposed to terrified or whiny and I say whiny only because so many people in older generations really hate on millenials and complain how entitled we are.It is absolute crap for any teacher to single you out for any physical feature or race. However it is up to you whether you want to let it slide so that you can stay under the radar or fight it and potentially have it be a big deal that will require some work on your end.If you do decide to fight please feel free to pm me for support encouragement or advice if you want it. Whatever your choice though good luck!,IndianCountry,dd3jrku,4,t5_34kjy

Im guessing was fakeTrump would have bragged about it even if the media were hiding it. The pipeline being  miles away seemed to be a real thing though. But I guess it environmentally effects the towns or something?I havent been following it super up close so I just hear these wildly differing stories from both sides. I WORRY that that the democrats are just using it for politics. Id be happy to hear a proper explanation though. Why is this the focus if its  miles away,IndianCountry,dg1d0bv,-4,t5_34kjy

11766554,0,t3_67wf6n,Culture music arts etcMany instruments of preColumbian origin are still used in common musicProbably one of the most famous is the maraca rattle as mentioned before it was used and I think still used by current living tribes in one hand during rituals in preColumbian times in post Columbian times its used one in each hand and is used a lot in various musical stylesAnother instrument is the guiro which is like a gourd with notches and sound is produced by rubbing a stick making a scratch sound I think is of taino or caribean origin but I read its used as far as brazil similar instrument is the Colombian guacharaca which I have read it was used to lure a bird with the same name in preColumbian timesDrums probably have various origins since there is various types and the most probable are African ones infact there is a lot of African influence in latinamerica music I think even in genres like tango but not so sure about that oneI cant make a list classifying music styles since I barely know about thatDont know much about flutes or other wind instruments from preColumbian origin that are still used in Venezuela besides the ones used by current living tribes the famous Peruvian pan flute named zampoa I think dont reach VenezuelaChords instruments were almost non existant in preColumbian latinamerica as far as I know only one I know of is a type of maya drum with a chord attached to the leather piece and hold vertical with a stick and another stick is used to rub the cord and produces a sound similar to jaguar grunts some Europeans instruments like the guitar where modified like one small bolivian guitar like instrument that is made from the shell of a armadilloA dance style wich is like the national dance style of Venezuela is the joropo Its supposedly based in the fandango wich is a spanish style but its origins are uncertains some say it has from Moorish origin to African and native south American origins too  a Spanish dictionary of the s mention the fandango as a American mullato dance and that it was introduced by travelers from the indies so its probably that it does have some native American origin and the joropo itselfs do seems to have some native American influence a explanation definition I found is that apparently in colonial times in the central plains regions of Colombia when the dance and music was performed the local indigenous people of the Casanare region when they participated they used to say more joropo! and thus the word was associated with the dance EDIT correction aparently it was when the music and dance stoped that the local indigenous said joropo! more joropo! as were asking for the music to continueThe dresses used in joropo are considered as one of the national dresses the music normally associated with joropo is a type of folk music named musica llanera due to originating from the central plain region called llano wich is a word used for flat terrain or plainThe Andean region folklore dress consist of a poncho like cloth called ruana and I think other names tooCoastal areas and other African influenced regions have folk music heavily based in drums and fast rhythm that sometimes look almost identical to African dance style though I do have read there was native influence too hard to define it only on basic instruments like drumsIn other arts normally there is tons of crafts that have native origin and probably African too that are mostly seem in street markets in tourist areas is normal that current living tribes sell their craft to tourists too things like basketry and ornaments like necklaces bracers etcThere is statues depicting indigenous historical figures in various parts especially in places related to them like guaicaipuro in caracas and Yaracuy in yaracui state one in particular is one called monument to the indian woman was build at the beginning of the  century is a monolith that have  plaques representing the countryes liberated by bolivar and at the top a figure of a indian woman that represents freedomAnother thing that may be related to culture is that a common gesture in Venezuela and other regions of latinmaerica is to point at stuff with the mouth or lips or chin especially directions wich I read is also common among northamerican natives is mentioned in this wikitravel guide,IndianCountry,dgtrpci,5,t5_34kjy
