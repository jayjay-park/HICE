95954,0,t3_1v5z1k,I hit a curb  weeks ago and damaged my right front rim. I also had to have my bearings replaced and the part was  and about  to install.I was experiencing the same symptoms as you.

1168738,0,t1_chykhda,I have a  Gx with about  miles on it.  The engine and transmission are still very strong.  You do need to check oil levels in these VQ engines frequently and expect to add a quart every  miles depending upon your driving habits.  Only problems Ive had  CD changer quit working  disc Bose unit. Had to replace front passenger side axle.  This is a fairly common replacement for this car and most and a little pricier for the axle and harder to find since the only car in the world which uses this axle is the  Gx.  Expect that to cost  for the part but its a fairly easy DIY.  And FYI and everyone elses there is no clip on the groove in the axle spline this part is actually already preinserted permanently into the front differential and does not come out with the axle.I also had to replace a torpedoed front differential and front drive shaft.  I believe the damage to the drive shaft occurred after hitting some road debris so this really isnt a part commonly needing replacement.  An aftermarketslashremanufactured drive shaft was  and the front differential from salvage was .  Labor at Infiniti dealership was .  This is the only car repair I didnt attempt myself. The drive belts on the G are super simple to replace.   Belts should run you under  to replace and theyll have a lifetime warranty if you get them at Autozone or OReillys or NAPA or....Also the last issue I had was replacement of the lower control arm Infiniti call this the compression rod bushings.  OEM has a rubber bushing I opted for an aftermarket polyurethane bushing.  One more thing Ive replaced was the front antiroll bar endlinks.  Easy and a set costs about  IIRC.  When you start hearing the front end knocking over bumps its either the compression rod bushing going bad or the antiroll bar end links.This car has been super reliable and I am not too easy on it.  ,infiniti,ci13q98,2,t5_2s6lc

I used two flat head screwdrivers to get them to roll on.

6404234,0,t1_czhkgj2,The first sign that it is failing is that the clutch will move to its bite point when engaging with basically zero force. Then when disengaging it will not move past the bite point on its own. You may have to stick a toe under the clutch pedal and pull it the rest of the way. It may otherwise work fine and this may only happen once in several depressions. Youll know it has fully failed when the clutch falls all the way to the floor without engaging.

8187572,0,t1_d50yj9y,I believe most of the cars theses days have the knock sensors that adjusts the timing to avoid damaging the engine. So knocking is definitely not common anymore unless youre driving a very old car. I think Im going to try regular with periodic supreme for now. The dealer also told me that regular is fine and he uses regular for his BMW as well. Since I live quite far from work the bill will definitely add up quickly using premium.,infiniti,d50zxzq,1,t5_2s6lc

8994347,0,t3_53g94o,Working on polishing up cleaning up the engine bay on my  G. I definitely recommend hitting up Baid Polish he does amazing work.

11073064,0,t3_5y317p,Good plan. I think the biggest thing you have going for you is like you mentioned is the fact it is a manual. Much more desirable in my experience and at k it wouldnt be a bad car for a young professional between the ages of  who is looking for an affordable sport sedan with good reliability.
