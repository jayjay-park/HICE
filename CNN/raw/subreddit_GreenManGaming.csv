4832492,0,t1_cu2mehj,If Im reading this correctly it sounds like you were trying to buy a key for the North American servers but were given one for the European servers? If you think they were deceptive and seem to be refusing to act on good faith you might be able to dispute any charges with GMG via your credit card company. Id suggest looking into it regardless  their support is clearly ages behind the times. ,GreenManGaming,cu3obdw,1,t5_2su4j
