3888256,0,t1_cqytzot,Thank you so so much for your help. I posted a revised version above but here is the redraft below.  If you still have any time Id really appreciate any thoughts you might have.  This version is intended to be far more charactercentric.Begin summary.Every young person dreams that theyre special.  Nicholas Foster however is facing the realization that he isnt and never was.His career creating fantasy artwork is going nowhere his new boss hates him and his girlfriend is openly wondering if its about time to grow up.  Worse hes being plagued by puzzling nightmares in which creatures from his artwork appear to recognize and beckon to him.  He dismisses these as byproducts of the feverish stress in his life until a knock at the day reveals the same old man hed dreamed the night before.  In a quaking voice the old man informs Nick that his dreams have done terrible damage to the barriers between the real and the imagined that a great wound has been opened in the fabric of thought and that only he can fix it.Just days after he was on the cusp of concluding that he was nobody Nick finds himself at the center of an ancient struggle waged just beyond our perceptions.  The source of all our nightmares is looking for him and the outcome threatens to tear the waking world asunder.  Nick will find that his dreams coming true might be the last thing he ever wanted and in order to set things right hell have no choice but to become person he hoped he was all along.  Dreams are not quite what he thought they were  but perhaps neither is he.,Queries,cqzhtrv,1,t5_383qi
4090880,0,t1_crmkiu7,Thank you so much for your feedback! A lot of people have said they like The Silencing Rooms better.gtI thought this was metaphorical I never even considered that heh. I have a little rewriting to do. gtwhereas all you really need to convey at this point is that she committed a crime and hurt them.Well I think do need to convey that shes in the dark regarding who they are for the first half of the novel as well as slip in who they really are and what the crime really means for their family. But I think I agree about focusing on the meat... the meat of the story is so multifaceted though much like Game of Thrones is multifaceted. Its difficult to grind down to such a multifaceted thing in one page so I wanted to focus on whats at stake.,Queries,crml2up,2,t5_383qi
