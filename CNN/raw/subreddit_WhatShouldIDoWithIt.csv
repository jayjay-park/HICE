2451389,0,t3_2nktz5,I bet you could probably use them as some sort of giant ball bearings and make something like a giant lazy susan table.Not sure how youd apply it exactly but the giant ball bearing idea leaves you with some interesting options. It wouldnt need to be as perfect as you see in the picture since youre not really going for performance just functionality.With  golf balls you could seriously come up with something that you could make multiple of and sell. Maybe use a glass top so you can see the golf balls and make a golf enthusiasts night stand? Youd need a locking mechanism to make sure it doesnt just spin unwanted but there are tons of ways you could do that. ,WhatShouldIDoWithIt,cmep132,2,t5_35498
