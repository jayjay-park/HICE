1000403,0,t3_25hgde,Its really up to you. Personally I hate conventional automatic transmisions with every touch of the gas pedal and every shift. I also love manual transmissions. The XT you are looking at and Subarus in general have great torque and good gearing that will eliminate the old I hate driving a manual in stopandgo traffic argument. Just maintain good following distance and try to never come to a complete stop. Throw a short shifter on it for even better feel. I am using a Kartboy setup and I can row through the gears while keeping my hand in almost exactly the same spot using only finger motions. It took me  months to find a manual FXT in my price range and I had to travel  miles for it. ,SubaruForester,chi053g,3,t5_2y78a

5214472,0,t1_cvccytl,Yep this is totally correct. In my experience the rear diff oil might make even more of a difference than the front in terms in driving feel. I removed the rear diff plugs by using a ratcheting  breaker bar and floor jack and essentially jacking the rear of the vehicle up with the breaker bar. Sounds sketchy but it is a wellknown trick and works great. Also when changing your rear diff fluid remember to ALWAYS remove the fill plug top first!Good luck with the Subie OP I bet she will drive considerably better with some simple fluid changes.,SubaruForester,cvejci9,1,t5_2y78a
