227083,0,t3_1wor54,So why are both the pots on a high temp with no one watching over them?  I am guessing someone is intentionally trying to burn something but there isnt even steam or smoke coming from them.There should be something coming from those pots.Where are the dials to control the temp of the stove tops? Even fancy stoves have a touchscreen to control the temps of the stove and oven. Yet this one works on magic.Since when are the cabinets behind the sink? This is the first one I have seen with cabinets behind the sink. It might make sense if there was more room on the other side of the sink but this island is to small to be having cabinets on both sides. Also that space underneath is for the plumbing for the sink why would you have someone work backwards to fix your sink?How does the oven open? The door goes straight to the floor leaving no room for the door to actually open. Most ovens I have encountered have a space underneath where you can store pots and pans. That space gives the door enough space to open. Your oven does not have that space.I have work in many kitchens in my life. It is a very nice render and it looks like you are going for a realistic look. With these inconsistencies with reality it is not realistic. Keep up the good work though and I like where you are going. ,blender,cf4a99u,5,t5_2qim4

770138,0,t3_22yxil,I made a lengthy critique for you. I downloaded your image and used arrows and circles to note a few things. You can find that image here One. Your model is three dimensional however your moon is a single plane. While this is low poly your moon should have at least a tiny bit of depth to it. Two. There is a random brown plane that is part of the mountain here. However it is so flat and not connected to anything visible that it just looks like filler material and a single plane that you just plonked down. Three. The river at this point is very very high. Because you are using low poly it is very difficult to make realistic water paths. However at this point the water it so thick that it looks like a giant wave coming from the mountains that will swallow up the valley below. Four. The side of your mountain looks like it just ends. As if a giant knife were to have cut through that point.Thats all I have for now! Just make sure you branch away from low poly. Its a good art style but its incredibly limited and only utilizes some of the vast quantities of animation and design tools in Blender.rawr,blender,cgrti8l,3,t5_2qim4

812528,0,t1_cgwkk7c,gt you can accidentally move something without noticing it and that can ruin your work amp waste hours of time. Well... to each his own but I find this ridiculous. If you move something by accident you simply undo. The Blender way of doing things requires two clicks of two different buttons to pick up something to move and to confirm its repositioning. This is inherently at least twice as slow rather than the remote possibility that you wont notice a mistake and supposedly waste hours you are guaranteed to waste hours on menial clicking to do a basic operation.The thing that worries me is the attitude I see the Blender community.gt how blender works and is thus easier amp faster to use than other suites.gt This is one of the reasons why rightclick select is superiorThis kind of yay our side boo their side! cheerleading is ultimately an impediment to progress.

The reason its like that is because I wanted to keep the view somewhat symmetrical hence the name of the video and if i had it going through one of the holes in the structure it would have looked uneven.  Also if I made the camera bigger the animation would have appeared shorter than it actually was.

2782149,0,t3_2rxs1q,First off I like the ring design and the gemstones look pretty good.But I can see a kind of fan pattern around some of the gems which is usually caused by smooth shading trying to interpolate normals across faces where it shouldnt. Maybe play around with edgesplitbevel settings to try and fix that.The hand also doesnt feel very realistic especially in comparison to the ring. If possible you should try to improve its shader maybe basing it off the Subsurface Scattering node instead of Diffuse. It could probably also benefit from a displacement texture to add skin and fingerprints. Musgrave and Wave noise textures might be a good base for such a thing. It might also help to add those creases between finger segments as part of the geometry itself.Sorry if all this seems a bit much. But really this scene could be a pretty solid base to which incremental improvements are made until it looks truly epic. ,blender,cnkbk9p,1,t5_2qim4

If you see something like Use nodes and a grey field below it or Surface Background and a greyish field the light isnt coming from above  its coming from all around.  Without having the blend or a telling screenshot there are a couple of things that couldve gone wrong with the spot   Its facing in the wrong direction.   Its too weak compared to the light of the scene.   Its settings are wrong too big a lightsource too big a radius falloff...   Its on a layer thats not selected to render  etc.    You could try to add a sun to the scene and then move and rotate it until it points at your robot.  Suns are pretty strong in blender you should see a difference now.  If not well... you can always upload your file to pasteall.org and we can have a closer look at what went wrong.

3301572,0,t1_cp4l6ty,blender has the multiresolution modifier. I guess that would be similar. I think it has more to do with how vray handles high resolution meshes than how youre d software does.  im not advanced enough to know. Pentium  whoa look out! Its a real screamer lol. vray is definitely decreasing polycount according to final pixel size. optimizations make all the difference. when I get into more professional jobs ill be looking into vray for decreasing rendertimes. Its definitely a lot more mature than cycles. but at least cycles will keep getting nicer like everything else.  for modeling textures animation blender does a great job and I enjoy using it.  ,blender,cp4ltdk,2,t5_2qim4

Sometimes even on the bug tracker.

3472859,0,t1_cpnmu5d,ahh i just saw it on deviant The hair is so much better now although the front bit which sticks out over her forehead should either be reduced to half the height it is currently or removed in my opinion. This is due to the fact it casts a very large shadow onto her head which is out of style for this sort of render. The eyebrows should probably be done with a bezier aswellsmooth one piece part as currently they still look like the old hair like playdough smeared onto her face.The rest of the face is perfect for the style and very well done. I like the style and its a bit like the style used in the movie tangled as you can see here You can learn a lot from studying a professionals work like this image for example you can see the whites of her eyes are more matte than specular and it brings out the specularity in her iris and pupil compared to your eyes which look like glass eyesmaybe go for a mix between the two mess around but never go full specularity no hardness. Another thing you can see is that from your deviantart description you seem to be going for a happycute theme but your lighting is very dark and gloomy and makes her seem sad. If you are going for the dark and gloomy however you still need to maintain proper lighting techniques like  point lighting and such. You should also note that a light source is generally not next to a face and so you do not get any sharp shadows but a soft transition over the face however your light source means you cast a shadow over the nose and lips which exaggerates the shape of her face. refrence This scene i quickly made shows how having a large volume light like a square with an emmision surface produces soft shadows and the such which looks nice and means no matter how extruded i made Suzannes face the shading stayed smooth. The third image however shows a spotlight and you can see how it creates shadows similar to those in your image which break up the shading creating hard unappealing shadows.,blender,cpo4qee,1,t5_2qim4

The ray tracer basically does a pass for each pixel for each ray tracing light in the scene so a scene with  spot lights will take  times as long to render as a scene with just . This is specific to raytracing however. Its really not much of an issue with buffer shadows. Not at all sure how it affects cycles if at all since I mostly use IR.,blender,cq9iviq,2,t5_2qim4

Black will be . roughness or super clear  and white will be . or super muddy.For the liquid you might want a consistent roughness  but on the glass you might want to paint one some light roughness to add condensation on parts of the glass and maybe remove some to add finger prints or marks to add some detail.if the surface isnt enough if for example you need the ice to fade better you can use the volume nodes,blender,csila0b,2,t5_2qim4

4708862,0,t3_3fexy8,can try something like this but if you plan to animate its probably not an ideal solution. There are  shaders. A shader for more cubic structures using the geometrys normal. The math adds to the normal moving the gradient so the color ramp has more values to play with. The color ramp is set to constant to give you a sharp transition between colors. and its funneled through an emit shader which will not accept shadow or light.. An alternate version of the above shader but with a normal node plugged in letting you choose where the light direction is. . For the more cylinder like objects i used layer weight node instead of a geometrys normal node to feed into the color ramp. Adding a few more colors into the color ramp to give it stripes.And thats all for the shaders  also set it to use freestyle but kept it in cycles because the cycles nodes were being used. EDIT apparently i deleted the main camera before uploading it sorry about that not sure why that happened. No going to waste pastealls space by uploading it again just a heads up.,blender,cto39ae,1,t5_2qim4

OBJ is the most reliable but OBJ does not contain object information as in if you have multiple objects in one obj file it will join them together. .dae collada has always had troubles and quirks so i would steer clear of that one... .dxf is a autocad file format not really aimed at animation... so yeh i would stick to obj then dsfbx if that doesnt suit your purposes.,blender,cu0yfzd,5,t5_2qim4

5073714,0,t1_cuwjply,gt and it has something to do with the aperture of the lens having an oval shape.More precisely in real life at least it has to do with the aperture of the lens not having an oval shape.It comes from when movies were shot on film with an aspect ratio of  but the movies needed to be widescreen. Rather than leaving the top and bottom of the frame unexposed and wasted nonspherical lenses were developed called anamorphic. These produce an image thats stretched vertically to expose all the film. When the film was ready to be shown it was projected threw a corresponding projector that squashed it back to widescreen.When you have an ovalshaped lens but your aperture is still circular it does weird things to the bokeh. This is the reason anamorphic lenses are sometimes used with digital cameras today. It gives an interesting bokeh look that reminds you of when it made more practical sense for image quality purposes.,blender,cuxkozn,3,t5_2qim4

6325442,0,t3_426yh6,It looks really nice! However you asked for a critique so...The rock looks a little off... it looks like you maybe? used a displacement mesh but the settings are a bit off. And it looks like the UV mapping is not quite what it should be the rock striations are your giveaway.Also the edges of the rock are almost... hmmm... too sharp? Too smooth? Maybe add a second displacement modifier with the mesh on a smaller scale to add to the roughness Also I may turn down the contrast on the sea rocks to make them a little... darker? The light and dark patches at that size should come from the rock data itself the image texture is too large to really be realistic from this distance.Maybe turn up the roughness on glossy node for the lighthouse too. It seems too smooth on the surface scale. And it looks like you added an image texture to the lighthouse but skipped the displacement modifier. The texture doesnt seem to have much depth if you will more of a light shaded overlay.After that Id turn down the size of the light source sun lamp right? which will help sharpen the shadows. The larger the sunlamp the bigger and smoother the shadows.It looks really good though! I havent done anything with the ocean simulator yet!

6544443,0,t1_czw4nn1,I find it fun to try and help with stuff like this it reminds me of when I tutored. and honestly the project Im working on at work is the worst and I need an excuse to break occasionallyI assume youre using Cycles though I never asked. You can see a list of render passes here You can activate them in Scene Panel under Passes.Also you probably know this but you need to select Render Animation not just render frame to output directly to a file. I totally forgot that. There are two methods I know of to output the passes  Select your output as a multilayer EXR as mentioned here I find doing this when using after effects to be a pain. I find that programs like Nuke are better suited to work with mutlilayer EXRs. Use the node editor in the compositing nodes section to create a file output node and manually add paths to the node. I just did this and it was pretty simple and output correctly. This was my quick setup If you go the multilayer route which I just tested and saves easily youll have to use the EXtractoR plugin in After Effects to separate all the layers from the single EXR file. Not really a huge problem but I find it just a bit annoying.Also The Irradiance pass doesnt seem to exist in Cycles. I use Maya at work and Blender at home and most D programs seem to be phasing it out for some reason even though I really really find it helpful. The closest similar thing is the Diffuse Direct pass which should only show the direct light from the camera and remove bounced light from the pass. The Diffuse Indirect shows only the bounced light and removes direct light sources. Both are very useful and can be exchanged for the Direct Irradiance map that older render softwares had and I still stubbornly use. ,blender,czw8yhd,2,t5_2qim4

Also I wanted to finish it before the weekend so I tried composing the music as finishing as possible hopefully giving some sense of logical ending. Not sure how it turned out because Ive watched it so many times now its really hard to get out of the box after a while.The tube is just a simple curve that is beveled using the settings inside the curve property settings and its hooked to two empty objects that are respectively patented to different parts of the tank. Its a super quick way of adding something extra flexible to the model. Too bad I cant figure out how to texture it because it doesnt seem to respond properly to neither UV unwrapping or any texture coordinate setting.But Im glad you liked it!

7501130,0,t1_d2urfz1,You could try adding depth of field that always works to make something like this look cooler.  I cant really think of a focus point for this scene eather because as you said its so simple.  If you want to turn it into a finished scene you could try adding something else to the scene.  If its just a learning exercise you definitely dont need one. What I personally would do for this scene is move the camera low to the surface of the board set the lens angle wide add depth of field so that only a few pieces are in focus and then really try to get a good looking wood texture onto the board.  The grains in the board look kind of flat as it is right now and I think it might help the scene to use a texture thats a little more detailed that you can use bumpdisplacement mapping with.  Having two wood objects the board and floor make them clash and they compete with each other in my opinion so just going low onto the board so you cant even see the floor would help,blender,d2uu8hl,1,t5_2qim4

Theyre both direct ray tracing renderers but VRay is far more heavily optimized for certain situations which makes it as much as several time faster for most commonsimple scenes at least on CPU but the drawback is that it ends up being slower in certain cases like with depthoffield effects a notable Achilless heel of VRay and makes it in my opinion much less flexible for uncommonexotic custom materials than Cycless simpler nodebased workflow.,blender,d3dsq9t,2,t5_2qim4

Its not Blender tutorials but I feel like it can be valuable information when you feel down and out on your work. I personally work on multiple things at a time I no longer care if I fail or when something turns out not the way I want I just press on to a new project. Worrying about failing is just going to scare you away from even opening the software which will lead you to of course never improve. IMO it looks like the Blenderguru is scared of the same thing considering hes never really posted a human model besides that astronaut or that old man under a tree. To be scared of doing something for over ten years seems kind of tragic. I might not be a pro but I think character and creature modelling is just too cool to pass up and Id rather try and fail at it than make barrels or teapots or something. ,blender,d4lj70j,2,t5_2qim4

The crash with the exporter happens if you have ngons in your mesh tris and quads are fine the mesh has a UV map and you have the Tangent Space option enabled in the FBX exporter like in the screenshot I posted. Im pretty sure you need the Tangent Space option enabled if you want to have any hope of using custom vertex normals so yeah tris and quads only.The degenerate tangent warning in my experience means your UVs are messed up with respect to the mesh and should be unwrapped again. Often if they have become overlapping or new faces created on the mesh but no matching faces on the UV map etc. ,blender,d4zya9b,1,t5_2qim4

The rubber base now includes a glossy shader as well as a bump map and the cone is now composed of a glossy diffuse translucent and subsurface shader.In my first model the base was completely flat which I realised after was incorrect as the cones would not be able to stack. I changed the model and added extra detail on the base. I then applied a subsurface modifier to the whole model and adjusted crease values of each edge to keep the shape correct.The shader for the reflective material is a modified version of this retroreflective material by Moony on blendswap with a hexagon texture I found on google images.Im really happy with how this turned out but if you have any critique that would help to make it even better please dont hesitate to say.,blender,d6ra656,8,t5_2qim4

9996323,0,t1_dbag0jx,On VFRI agree about VFR. We dont need it but it would be a time saver to have support for it. Frankly the issue that my video editing students have is due to Game Recorders that tend to record at VFR like Geforce Experience. In addition many smartphones still record in VFR too. So when I tell a viewer Hey you have to convert your video to CFR with Handbrake or FFmpeg they are usually a little annoyed that they have to take an extra step just to get the video audio synced in blender. On Hardware AccelerationHardware accelerated playback would really reduce the need for using video proxies which has become almost mandatory for videos that are P or higher on Midrange computer setups.Ive heard that GPU rendering is a little less versatile than CPU rendering but I dont know if that would also be true in order to support Hardware Accelerated ffmpeg Encoding.On FrameserverI also thought about using the frameserver feature but it was a little over my head. I would greatly appreciate any input you can give me on using frameserver with external FFmpeg encoder where we can control all the encoding options.  ,blender,dbajsid,1,t5_2qim4

There is also the Now archived Animation Fundamentals Course by Beorn that can help you get started as well! I first watched and attempted this course over a year ago when I was on and off Animation in BlenderI actually never finished the course sadly!. I would do something for a week then go on a break wasnt very productive at all. This was also the time when I was first starting out in Blender learning its User Interface and everything about it so it was very daunting to start. Nevertheless the lessons Beorn goes through in his course are very thorough and he takes the time to explain everything needed. Sure some of the videos may be long but theyre long for a reason as he explains every detail and why you should take on certain things. The Animators Survival KitPlease consider buying a copy for yourself to support the creators! When looking around for animation tips I kept seeing this one particular book being recommended to others constantly and went and gave it a shot. Purchased a copy for myself from Amazon to read home and I use this .pdf to read it on my phone on my breaks at work. Although a lot of it is for traditional animation a lot of the concepts is very relative to D animation as well! Im not even halfway done with the book myself and it has helped me understand the foundation of animation to a good point! I use this book for references as well as good tips and things to remember when animating. Alan Beckers Animation Tutorials or Youtube in General When I was first starting out I had seen Alan Beckers animation principle series where he breaks down each one and made it easy for me to understand. Animation itself is already complex as it is and his simple straighttothepoint videos made it easy to grasp. After which I then watch many youtube animation tutorials whether its DisneyDreamworks fanmade videos or lone tutorials.These are all the resources Ive used so far to get where I am now and still need lots more work to get done!

10294828,0,t1_dcaxs4h,Blender Render is useful for some things like for making cartoon style renders but if you want to compete with the big boys you really need to experiment with Cycles Render.If you made this with Cycles it would look much better. With Cycles it makes it look realistic and just more appealing. My main problem with Cycles is lighting but Im overcoming it everyday.I never was able to use tutorials its a very personal subject dont ask when I was first learning Blender but heres a good one. It may be a little outdated but I think it still holds up today.Cycles can be taxing on your hardware though. I wouldnt use it if you were working with  GBs of RAM or under. Side note I wouldnt use a Mac for Blender Usage. Windows and Linux versions are much better  GBs or above and you should be fine using Cycles for barely medium usage.Here on this subreddit you dont see too much Blender Render stuff besides toonstyle renders like that Happy Taco. Cycles is the way to go.Also how did you add textures with Blender Render? Ive been learning the game engine which only uses Blender Render now sadly when the devs could just condense and simplify Cycles for the games engine and Ive been wanting to add textures.

10513346,0,t3_5qh6j9,Most of these can be made in the node editor with the normal wireframe node controlling a mix shader with an emission and transparent shader.  ampnbsp  However the wireframe node always uses the triangulated mesh meaning that you cant get a wireframe of just a square or pentagon this seems to be an issue with other wireframe shaders as well. To get around this here is another method I made which uses modifiers.  I hope this helps   ampnbsp  Edit felt like adding one more method to make a true wireframe shader for something made exclusively of squares i.e. see the squares without lines going across their diagonals take the Parametric output of the Geometry node and plug it into a Separate XYZ node take the X output of this and plug it into a Colorramp plug the color output of the Colorramp into the factor of a Mix Shader between an Emission and Transparent node same as with normal wireframe setting the Colorramp to constant and adjusting the sliders should outline two of the edges on each square this method may not work well for something with a lot of open edges like a plane or object with a hole in it  Again I hope this helps ,blender,dczst1j,9,t5_2qim4

To convert your render camera to be orthographic just go to the camera options tab on the right side and click on Orthographic. To get the exact angle for Isometric projection so its exactly like your linked images select your camera press AltR to reset all the rotations from the camera. Now rotate on X by  degrees and then rotate on Z by  degrees. You can change what side you view from just make sure its always rotated so its pointing in a diagonal direction and tilted  degrees down from horizontal.,blender,dd1ytk7,11,t5_2qim4

10662871,0,t3_5sf08o,. Number of bounces can increase the render time. For example you have a room where the only light source is the sun from the window you get noisy result with  bounces so you need more sample  more render time. . Smaller number of max transparency doesnt really matter if you dont have transparent objects but if you have and  is not enough than it is a pretty great decrease in quality.. reflective caustics can decrease the time of the render and sometimes without much quality loss this is a good tip but only if the target audience know what this is. . refractive caustics is almost exclusively a quality loss if you dont have glass or something similar it doesnt cause quality loss but doesnt decrease the render time either.. filter glossy Maybe I am wrong but I think this doesnt matter the slightest if you disable the caustics. . you dont need to set the world max bounce to  if you already set it in the render panel to .  This is why I dont like many tutorials. It is simply not enough to go through the options without any explanation. ,blender,ddfsl5l,1,t5_2qim4

11467526,0,t1_dft06zo,Yeah. I often do spider and insect legs using sine and cosine waves together with IK since its hiliarously easily if youre okay with a bit of programming and out of the box gives a pretty natural result that can also be scaled with the speed of the walk fairly well. Come to think of it theres probably a way to implement this through the graph editor without any programming at all. I think the thing thats making your animation a little jerky is that the legs seem to come to a pause or a full stop at the end of each cycle.  Depending on the type of spider Id probably have the front and back legs travel a further distance on the front to back axis as well. The body is probably a little higher than I would put it the body tends to be lower to the ground in relation to the knees. If you rigged it using IK its really fun to adjust the position  attitude of the body since the IK chains will solve the new position between your IK target feet and your body automatically so you can easily adjust the relationship between the feet legs and body during an animation. ,blender,dfvu63z,2,t5_2qim4

11519099,0,t1_dg1n3ww,Thats weird. The gaps between a lot of the faces in your UVs make it seem as if they were individually marked as a seam. Heres a picture of what it should look like with a cylinder  This means that when you texture the rectangle of faces they will all be in line which allows you have a texture that isnt filled with seams. In case you didnt want to split it up into  pieces to fill UV space you can have UV maps at a ratio that isnt square so something  with x. That can be tedious to setup but its something to keep in mind as it can further decrease seams.Unless you want extreme close ups of the cloth Id just fake it with textures itd be easier. Though with the shape of where you want the cloth it wouldnt be too difficult to extrude a section of the bat where you want the cloth and separate it with the shortcut v to rip the edges. This would mean the mesh below it would be missing faces so you may need to readd them.,blender,dg1owj9,2,t5_2qim4

If you want you can upload the .blend and I will take a look.You could try applying materials to your mesh or selecting the faces you want and assigning the materials to the selection.,blender,dg2mh83,1,t5_2qim4

11720922,0,t1_dgobia2,This method looks really great. But in this case I think Im going to use the uRagingDerp one. I need to be able to destroy and warp the mesh easily.It can probably be done with your method but I think its more practical with how I already did it.Its good to know another method to go around things like this though. Ill have it in mind for future projects thanks!,blender,dgolgxg,3,t5_2qim4

I just did a  corner pin for my cloth simulation it seems like your original link had the full edges pinned. If you just jump into edit mode loop select the  edges and assign them to a vertex group youre going to pin your cloth simulation with you should get more similar results to the OP animation. ,blender,dgrr6fx,2,t5_2qim4

11796555,0,t3_689arz,Heres how you can make this less manual in the futureRightclick on the desktop and pick NewgtShortcutBrowse to the location of the blender executable which is probably something like CProgram FilesBlender FoundationBlenderblender.exeGive the shortcut the name Low Blender.Now right click the new shortcut and open the properties again. In the Target field just typecmd c start low blender.exeMake sure the Start In field still holds the diretory that Blender is installed in.Then you can change the icon by clicking change icon and again browsing to the blender executable and picking the binarys icon the other being the document icon.That icon will always launch blender at low priority. I have no idea why it doesnt work if the path is included.  You can pin it to your start bar or task bar or whatever if you want.Using the task manager still works if youve already started a render and want to turn down the priority after its already running of course.HTH!P.S. if you use Linux on the command line just prefix the command with nice.  I think renice is a thing too that lets you manually do what task manager can do graphically. I am guessing theres also something on the mac.,blender,dgx6ha8,5,t5_2qim4
