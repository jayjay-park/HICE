10803581,0,t1_ddsmjzw,Thanks both that is good feedback to have! There is certainly a balancing act between going fast enough not to keep people back and also ensure that we reach the end before everyone loses interest! and slow enough that people with different kinds of time constraints can be included.It will definitely take some calibration so I will be asking for feedback each week until we manage to find a level people can work with.I am interested to hear your thoughts on monday!morko.,TheGulagArchipelagoRG,ddubacq,1,t5_3j1kg
10971023,0,t1_dearuwd,It is interesting that you gained that perspective. During my education I came away with the impression that the SU was somewhat depraved in its internal politics but not as outwardly malicious as the Nazis were. We mustnt forget that the Nazis killed    million Jewish people purely based on group identity alone. Those numbers are staggering. Then again can this be said to be that different from the Holodomor As far as my weak understanding of it goes that was just as based on group identity. Perhaps it is different as the deaths were due to inaction or indirect action? The Nazis built and manned an efficient system of human slaughter.Perhaps the outcome here is that one simply cannot sensibly compare atrocities of this magnitude? The numbers are too high to be comprehended by human brains.Evil is evil regardless of form is the best I can come up with.morko.,TheGulagArchipelagoRG,debl0dt,3,t5_3j1kg
11080337,0,t1_denoc5j,Unprecedented wasnt what I had a problem with  I think it is unprecedented. It was gulf that I took issue with. I am pretty sure that a gulf isnt an accurate representation of the size of the problem.Could we perhaps agree that the administration has a different view of reality than I do Politico does and also the NYT CNN MSNBC etc.?It seems we have stumbled upon the central issue of postmodernism here. The administration and those aligned with it see it one way the others see it another way. So who is correct? How can we know? I would say that objective fact and empirical study appear to be on my side  but that might well just be my bias.morko.,TheGulagArchipelagoRG,deny2ql,2,t5_3j1kg
