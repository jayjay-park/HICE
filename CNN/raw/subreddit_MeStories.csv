3731935,0,t1_cqhkch5,Oh wow!  My hair curls as it is so for a while I decided to perm on top of the curls to get them tighter.I think a part of me likes the tight ringlet look but then I had it very short on one side and getting longer down the other.  The idea was to make it look like curls in the wind all the time. But it was the s and I was in grad school you could get away with anything! ,MeStories,cqhnxl3,5,t5_37tm2
3846211,0,t1_cqsbwz3,No youre definitely right. I had to get TWO cats to fill the void from Kitty  and the emptiness was still there. Getting only one would have been even more depressing.,MeStories,cqupaht,2,t5_37tm2

When I was a kid the neighbors got a my buddy dollyou know the Chucky doll.  Theyd bring it over and put it in my room in random places just because Id freak out over it.  ,MeStories,crwfy9d,3,t5_37tm2

9395075,0,t1_d96rbti,Lol no worries its always nice to get the full story. But yeah we owe about ten times what you did ish? Our house was about  in  and has been doubled in size and undergone a lot of renovations... but theyre paying about month for the mortgage. Its probably going to be worth about  when all the work is done Id hope. Which makes it sounds like a lot nicer than it really is.But wtf... BEANIE BABIES? Come on. That sounds like my parents if you hadnt gone to such expensive colleges this is your fault crap. Except uh... way worse. And the one income was from your mom working... a.k.a. your dad wasnt? She supported him for years and he treats her like that?Our families are so ridiculous I swear.,MeStories,d96w451,1,t5_37tm2
