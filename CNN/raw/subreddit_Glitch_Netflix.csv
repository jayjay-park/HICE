Like shows dont just randomly put in incredibly specific references like that without symbolism.The only two people who took the olive oil were Sara and Vic.... Those are the two characters in the show who have been or will be presumably possessed via dying and coming back. However Sarah died outside of Yoorana so only time will tell.,Glitch_Netflix,dbd5fa3,8,t5_3h80m
