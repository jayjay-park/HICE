1090963,0,t1_chsa5a3,I dont think a Strawhat Dev coded it. Im pretty sure it was an open plugin. Ill try and find the name and send it to you.Basically what it was was a plugin that was configurable ingame by a modadmin they could activate a tournament and set what type of tourney they wanted v v v etc etc. When this activated players would do tourney join and the plugin would match them up randomly and the matches would start.,ShadowPVP,chsannp,1,t5_2v4g5
