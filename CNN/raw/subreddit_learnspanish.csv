34666,0,t3_1uhy9m,It really depends how your mind processes information but ill share whats worked for me.  I use proprofs.com to make study questions q and a multiple choice matching etc at  questions per test.  I used to do  per test but it wasnt effective for me.  For me  questions gave me instant feedback of my rights and wrong.  Id repeat the set until I was satisfied.  Start the next set then every so often throw in the previous set. Its also important to do these selfmade tests everyday.  Also get enough sleep so your mind can retain the in formation. This method helped me graduate with a . GPA bachelors degree.

221594,0,t3_1wk8fu,There are lots of good comments here with the rules and things to memorize. That may be the best thing to do if youre studying for a test. But if youre trying to learn to speak Spanish por vs para will come fairly quickly with practice. I think ugummybaerchen and utamtam have mentioned the best rules of thumb but there are no rules that will apply in all situations. The best way to get it down is to practice speaking and reading until you develop an intuition for it.Edit almost forgot the English word per is pretty much synonymous with the Spanish word por so if you could use the word per in English its a pretty safe bet you can use por.

1116844,0,t3_26wgf4,Immersion is definetely the best way to learn! I volunteered in Costa Rica in a really isolated place where no English was spoken at all! I was forced to speak Spanish and the first day was incredibly tough. I only knew some basics of the language before and on my first day I could not even understand what they wanted me to do to help them. I was confused all the time. DAfter just a week there I already noticed a big difference and managed to have basic conversations. Five more months of travelling helped so much that I now speak Spanish better than French  even though I studied French for  years at school and used to be good at it!I just dont know if an immersion program is necessary.

6746822,0,t3_47ngvo,It took me an insane amount of time to roll my rs and the reality is that anyone can learn how to do it. Essentially anyone has the propensity to roll their rs yet it is so difficult for so many people to do because that is not the mouth movement they have incorporated in their native language and while as a child you are able to adapt to mouth movements pretty easily its harder past a certain age.Therefore dont give up hope! The best tip I can give to you is to first learn how to push out air. This can be done by putting your two lips together and pushing out air in such a fashion that your two lips make a brrrrr sound. Secondly I think the strategy of putting your tongue on the roof of your mouth and then blowing out air is false. I tried that when I was learning and I had similar problems to you. I think if you just relax your tongue in a normal position push out air and then slowly let your tongue rise to the alveolar ridge you might find it easier. There really is no secret to doing it just lots of effort until one day it clicks. Its an excruciating process but really worth it if proficiency in Spanish is your goal!,learnspanish,d0h6f2c,1,t5_2rd6d

10301911,0,t3_5nhteq,first of all sorry for my bad english im still learning itThe whole text is almost perfect and a native spanish would understand it. But there are some little mistakes. Just be careful with accents prposito  is wrong the correct word is propsito. Also the correct form of the verb fijar in this case is fije presente de subjuntivo and not fija presente de indicativoltltCrear un propsito que se fije en la mejora de los productos y los servicios.gtgt.Maybe it is better to translate recognizes as reconozca. But if you want to use the verb fijar the correct form is fije. At the end of this point it missing the word different I thinkltltEstablecer una filosofa nueva que reconozca que estamos en una era econmica diferentegtgtorltltEstablecer una filosofa nueva que fije que estamos en una era econmica diferentegtgt.In this point No depender de inspeccin sounds really bad to me. No depender de una inspeccin or No depender de inspecciones are better. If you want to keep the word inspeccin in singular add una else you change the word to plural. Both Possibilities are correct in this case. Calidad need the article la... la calidadltltNo depender de inspecciones masivas para controlar la calidadgtgtorltltNo depender de una inspeccin masiva para controlar la calidadgtgt.The verb negocinar dont use para after it.ltltNo negociar con los proveedores sus precios pero tambin considerar su calidad.gtgt.Mejora is a female word so the verb has to be female too. Also I think Focus is better translated as centrarse but fijarse is not wrong.ltltFijarse en mejora continuagtgtorltltCentrarse en una mejora continuagtgt.Mtodos has a accent in the e the word y and when the next word begins whit i is changed to e so y invierta is incorrent you should say e invierta. Also like all the text is wrote in infinitive form maybe is better to use invertir to keep the coherence.ltltPracticar mtodos modernos de entrenamiento e invertir en entrenamiento en el trabajo para todos los empleadosgtgt.Just two accents. mtodos and supervisinltltMejorar el liderazgo y practicar mtodos modernos de supervisin.gtgt.I dont know how to explain why but the correct form isltltDeshacerse del miedogtgt.In this context is better to use barreras instead of obstculos. Accent in rea. Sounds better is you put the adjetive diferentes  before the noun reas.ltltDerribar las barreras entre las diferentes reas del negocio.gtgt.This is perfect. Also it is accepted the word eslganes or consignas but eslogans is not bad.ltltEliminar los objetivos los eslogans las metas numricas en el lugar de trabajo.gtgt.Perfect too.ltltEliminar las cuotas numricas y las normas de trabajo.gtgt.obstculos is in plural so you have to use the correct verb form desalientan. In this case in Spanish we use the infinitive form de hacer. ltltEliminar los obstculos que desalientan a los empleados de hacer sus trabajos.gtgt.Programa dont has accent.ltltEstablecer un programa de educacin para todos los empleados.gtgt.Que defienda present of subjuntivo instead of que defenderltltCrear una estructura en el administracin superior que defienda vigorosamente los primeros  puntos.gtgt,learnspanish,dcbrzjf,3,t5_2rd6d

Here are the resources Im usingCoffee Break Spanish podcast  min episodesDuolingoMemrisePersonally I find the latter two to be supplemental at best. Theyre both flashcard style learning resources so I wouldnt recommend doing JUST those. I consider the podcast to be my primary learning resource with the other two being secondary resources which I use when I have  minutes to kill.,learnspanish,dfka3a2,3,t5_2rd6d
11408395,0,t3_62thz1,I recently purchased an audiobook of short stories in Spanish that was advertised as being for beginners but Ive still found it pretty challenging to understand in terms of comprehension not necessarily vocabulary or grammar. If you look in the Language Learning section of Audible youll see several books like this. On your smartphone you should be able to manually adjust the speed of playback which is helpful but does seem to have a slightly negative impact on audio quality depending on how much you slow it down. The one I bought is titled Spanish Short Stories for Beginners by Olly Richards. The stories themselves arent exactly riveting but Im mainly listening to improve my comprehension anyway. ,learnspanish,dfp4mp1,3,t5_2rd6d

11796644,0,t3_687fvm,Of course it depends on whats your native language and some other things but I would say not so much if you do not spend some other time going over things and everything.For example I am a native Spanish speaking and I am currently living in Croatia. I attend  hours of Croatian classes which consists mainly in listening and speaking since they use a communicative method. I am also exposed to Croatian in the streets and try to use it as often as possible. I also do some studying although not so much around  hours a weeks on average. I started in September and in June I will have attained more or less a B level according to the guys from the course I doubt my speaking skills are actually up to that level.Summarizing I spend at least double the time you propose in Croatian plus some time outside of the classroom and I live in the country and I progress relatively slowly of course Slavic languages and Romance languages have some differences that make it harder to learn. If you do that for three four years you could probably reach a comfortable speaking level but your grammar knowledge and your writing skills would be pretty bad.  minutes a day is not so much you would need to be exposed to the language at a greater rate than that to see quick improvement I believe.,learnspanish,dgx6udb,1,t5_2rd6d
