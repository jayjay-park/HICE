990162,0,t1_chftnp0,I think this is one of the biggest problems why MUDs arent popular. The majority of MUDs are tailored for seasoned players in such a way that before enjoying the game a new player needs to spend hours tinkering with a client scripts aliases mappers etc.Would you read a book which you could only read if you commuted for several hours in unknown territory to then once you have it in your hands need to learn a new language to enjoy it? or would you just take the two minutes to start the playback and watch a sitcom?The greatness of MUDs is about the complexity that can happen serverside compared to graphical games where the majority of development is for client side visuals. So benefit from this by having more serverside scripting. We need more serverside goodies for newcomers.Power users can turn this off and have there elite scripting but dont turn newbies away.,MUD,chgu76y,1,t5_2quk5

2338724,0,t3_2lwky0,It was a calm evening in the summer. Gentle rays of sunset settled upon the village of Norwich casting soothing light over its people and buildings and reflecting brightly off the sea in the horizon. Seagulls soared lazily high over the harbour letting out loud defiant cries.A young girl dashed quickly through the wheat fields laughing loudly in joy as an older boy followed her.Youll never catch me Talin! she cried playfully as she launched into a neighboring field of corn.Talin stopped at the edge of the corn field hands on knees panting. Tias this isnt a game! Its time to come home! he called after her exasperatedly.If you want me to come home come and get me! her voice called back from the center of the field. Breath caught Talin straightened his posture. Tias! he called out sharply Father will not be pleased to hear of this. It is time to come home! Mother has dinner waiting for us. No reply. Sighing Talin prepared to enter the field. Corn husks nearby rustled as Tias moved between them emerging to the side of Talin vision. Jumping forward he hooked his arm around her head dragging her in while he rustled her hair with his other hand.Lego Talin! she cried in protest as she struggled to extract herself from his grip. He began to slowly drag her towards their house grinning wildly.On the doorstep of their home Talin loosened his grip. Slipping out from under his arm Tias took off turning around a few hundred feet away from the home to grin triumphantly at Talin.Thats when the first cannonball hit.It collided directly with the front door where Talin was standing ripping him apart as it tore through flesh bone wood and brick. The house collapsed fire raging around the frame. Blown back by the force Tias struggled to get to her feet. There was pain in her right arm where a moderately sized piece of wood had lodged itself. Looking around her vision blurred with tears from the smoke and pain. Loud booms and terrified screams echoed around her as cannonball after cannonball made contact with wood and flesh alike. Steel on steel clashed nearby although initially caught off guard the people of the village were beginning to fight back.A ragged man with a large sword came into view skewering his most recent opponent Mr. Davershy the blacksmith from down the road. Tias let out a small whimper of fear. Turning his head his eyes locked onto the little girl. Weve got a live one lads! He yelled joyously as he walked hastily towards her sword drawn and dripping with blood.Desperately she ran for the fields at the edge of town. She could hear laughter and calm footsteps behind her but she didnt look back. Her only chance was to lose them in the fields. Jumping nimbly into the wheat field she crouched low and began to make her way hastily towards the corn fields.Losing herself within the maze of the corn fields she delved deep within only stopping when she could not hear any distinguishable voices or movement. Falling to the ground she breathed heavily. Blood trickled down her arm and it throbbed even worse now that she had jostled around the wood impaled in her arm. Grabbing a stalk of corn she bit down as she ripped the wood out of her arm. Faint with pain she let the wood and stalk fall to the ground.That was when she began to smell the smoke. Trickles at first tickling her nose she assumed they were stray puffs from the now burning village. As the smoke increased she could hear a roaring in the distance fast approaching. They were burning the fields! Hastily herded by fire all around her she fled the fields emerging just outside of the village limits and straight into the arms of a pirate.Gotcha! he yelled as he swung her over his shoulder and hauled her back into town towards the docks. Yell fetch a pretty penny on the black market wontcha child? he laughed cruelly. In a final desperate attempt to escape Tias bit down on the nearest bit of flesh she could find ignoring the rank smell that emanated from this man. He yelped and threw her to the ground hard. Bitch! he yelled as he struck her across the face hard. She felt only the first few blows before sweet unconsciousness took her.In her dreams she was home with Talin and her family peacefully eating dinner and laughing at her fathers silly jokes. No one was dead. Everything was how it should be. In that moment Tias hoped more than anything else that she would never wake up again.,MUD,cm0s1ob,2,t5_2quk5

Once again this can be done directly from your MUD client or via a graphical web builder thing.

5254740,0,t1_cvjc1gl,My take on this Less text.Seriously. Minecraft works on the younguns because its blocky and easy to buildcraft.  Theres no steep learning curve or millions of classes and spells to learn. Its all laid out really simply. New MUDs need to learn from this.  Shorter more punchy text thats easy to read and is more engaging would be best. More handholding too. New gamers are used to being led by the nose through the first level of a game  if you leave them to figure stuff out from the off then they will disengage immediately.Back in the old days when we had nothing much to do on our machines spending an evening reading location descriptions for little clues or for an immersive experience was a normal thing to do.  These days with so much else happening in other windows on your machine your attention span is much much shorter.Going off on a complete tangent... maybe a dedicated MUDding machine like an old laptop that runs a client full screen is a good way to reengage with the medium?,MUD,cvjdufu,1,t5_2quk5

6301709,0,t3_41tzmg,I dont think so. There isnt a video game everyone at rgaming or rgames would get behind and play together either for the same reason. MUD is a super generic term for a wide spectrum of media just like video games. There are RPGs Puzzlers Action games casual games etc. etc. etc. Someone who loves a hidden object game isnt going to enjoy playing something that someone who loves ARMA would enjoy. In the MUD world there are scifi games fantasy games modern games. There are roleplay focused games and there are purely hack and slash games. There are games with strict permadeth and games with lenient resurrections. There are solely PVP games and solely PVE games and some that have a fair mix and some that I imagine have no combat at all. Different people will be drawn to these different games for different reasons. Personally I dont really care for hackampslash muds. I get my fix of that with roguelikes and graphical video games. I play MUDs for roleplay and stories. Ive played characters that have no combat skills whatsoever before but hat a hell of a time because of the plotlines they got tangled up in. There are others who are in it for the twitchy hack and slash PVP. Neither perspective is wrong but I cannot imagine a game where we could both be satisfied. ,MUD,cz5xln9,1,t5_2quk5

Anything more than that and the world will be in pvp chaos all day long. Lol. If there were a few thousand online ... no. The active population is actually bigger than you are trying to imply partly because most of the seniors are pretty casual and login for an hour or so each day partly because idling is not really encouraged because you WILL very likely get ambushed while idling partly because several professions have ways to disappear from WHO partly because tbh our population was at a low before we went FP.

7753582,0,t1_d3nhsjr,Well let me give you a hypothetical situationYoure standing in a room and there are two slots in the wall in front of you. You know that sticking your hand into a slot will produce either pleasure or pain but you have no way of knowing for certain what each slot will do. Above each slot is a piece of paper a guestbook of sorts. This paper is purportedly filled out by the people who have previously stuck their hands in that slot. Both pieces of paper say good things and bad things about each slot but the paper above slot A has more negative things to say than the paper above slot B. Given that you only have enough time to stick your hand in one slot before you leave the room which slot do you put your hand into?Now any logical person will pick slot B because all things being equal the increased ratio of positive to negative reviews means that the experience is more likely to be positive than the experience with slot A. Conversely there is a higher chance of the experience of slot A being negative as compared to slot B because there is a higher percentage of negative reviews for slot A than there are for slot B. As such the clear choice is to either stick your hand in slot B or abstain altogether.In terms of this discussion slot A is Avalon with the poor reviews and concerns that have been discussed on this subreddit ad nauseum. Slot B is any other MUD that has better reviews than Avalon does. Given that most players have a limit on the time they can spend MUDding in a day and given that theyre naturally going to want to pick the bestsounding MUD to spend their time on is it really any wonder that just because of these rumors people dont wanna try Avalon?,MUD,d3nivwk,3,t5_2quk5

8205461,0,t3_4rok21,Im still getting used to Reddit. I figured Id reply to my own comment.Basically my idea midfantasy I know there is low and high fantasy so I guess theres midfantasytoo?.  Humans are all normal humans. Most of the folklore is real the rest is highly exaggerated. Magic is real if you count what priests healers monks etc do as magic. I wanted fantasy to come alive but I didnt want it in your face.  The gods are real and hear all prayers but they may not always answer. Demons the main baddies in the game are also real and will be the things players will be fighting against. I havent really thought out the role of demons yet though.I want a game with a Feudal Japan theme maybe loosely based is a better term? so that anyone with a passing interest in Japanese culture could play. I honestly dont know much about the era myself but Im very interested in learning. Plus I feel that just being themed would give me or us if I have help more wiggle room if wed like to introduce different things in the future.,MUD,d538juu,3,t5_2quk5

Pk in Lusternia is a little harder but you can always go raiding enemy territories as the game is mostly territory based struggle and there will always be someone to stop you. One of the reasons why I stopped playing Lusternia was PK requires so much preparation and knowledge and I had no time for that since I was studying. ,MUD,d6gx25l,1,t5_2quk5

10709149,0,t3_5t6rpa,Regarding the details on HackMUD the language is JavaScript which is to Java what carpet is to car. In other words no relation. It requires a purchase on Steam. And its also a make your own fun sort of game which is to say only a couple hours of content but hey people can write JavaScript applications.As a MUD Sindome is more satisfying. And some of the best cyberpunk flavor Ive seen in a game.On the other hand if you have experience in programming or hacking that youd like to apply in a game I would instead recommend getting involved in a wargame or CTF like Microcorruption or OverTheWire The Bandit wargame is all about using Unix commands on a remote box. They dont have the multiplayer component unless you join a CTF team for competitions but theyre much betterrounded as hacking challenges.If you want a little fictional flavor to your hacking VulnHub has some boxes with deliberate vulnerabilities which youll run in a virtual machine to play with fictional themes. Theres one called Necromancer with a high fantasy flavor and another inspired by the Mr. Robot TV show among others.Edit Oh and if youre just looking for a game that doesnt involve actual hackingprogramming theres a browser game called Hacker Experience which is about hacking other players and installing viruses like adware and bitcoin miners on their machines to make you money so you can upgrade your computer to run things faster while also keeping your machine free of malware which slows you down. A little like a multiplayer Uplink without the fancy graphics or story. It eschews the terminal for a GUI though and the game loop is pretty transparent.

I personally abhor everything about Mudlets interface which is why I dont use it but there is no denying that its display and response time is very very good. This is large part because of how it handles triggers.For many many games that doesnt matter. For ones including very fast paced combat like IRE muds it may matter more depending on exactly how you play and how much you automate.
