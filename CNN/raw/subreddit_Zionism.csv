4544589,0,t3_3d8d09,Watching all the ProNuclear commenters rush to rIsrael to call them all war hawks has been interesting.Iran swears death to Israel and death to America every Friday but of course its Israel and the Jews who are the War hawks for declaring their intent to defend themselves not Iran for their nuclear and ICBM program combined with constant threats to the only Jewish state on earth. ,Zionism,ct3h02a,1,t5_2qovq

4932561,0,t1_cuga334,gt The Houthis slogan is God is great death to America death to Israel Death to the Jews Death to the Jews Victory for Islam.Sounds like they dont have any Jewish slogan makers over because they are awfully repetitive with the whole Death to Jews thing twice... and death to Israel too... I mean if youre saying death to Jews one already assumes its death to Israel since Jews live there but then again these politicalactivistsbleedyhearttypes always copy their predecessors and the ones before them have always been death to Israel since  ... but before that they were singing the death to Jews song while the Zionists were forming Israel for  years.So you know how songs go they blend together after a while.Anyway hopefully they will begin singing a new hymn about Saudi Arabia raining death from the skies upon their Houthi asses.  Then they can add another line about death to the Saudis  Victory for our Version of Islam.gt Clarify? Also enemies dont become More alliedwith each other when one swears to wipe out the other they become less hostilelol.Look at Russia they are the largest land holder on the planet.How do they do they do it?Allied with Syria for a while now after a long haul they are exiting.Allied with Iran forever.Allied with China.Allied with N.Korea.Leverage GermanyLeverage EuropeEtc. Etc. etc.Its called politics thats how its done... America seems to think you can just buy  bomb their way into victory.No wonder they are such a young empire making such young brutish mistakes.Israel has the problem of insane religious hatred and the whole holy Jihad  holy land crap thats tough... hopefully this ISIS shit will wake up the sane ones in the region... hopefully they will ally with the moderateliberal military types who actually want to get shit done instead of living in a religious caliphate.,Zionism,cugaeab,-2,t5_2qovq
5295919,0,t1_cvoc11b,Well the internet isnt a good place for conversation because the very best and the very worst discussions are had. However where else would you have a conversation? The thing I miss about the internet when having a discussion at a party or at shule is that a discussion online somewhere like reddit might involve someone acting as a fact checker making sure that everyone isnt making baseless claims... at least most of the time.,Zionism,cvom53k,1,t5_2qovq
5622449,0,t3_3s2ypd,Your ignorance is so profound that it offends me. If you had any interest in legitimately learning youd spend at least  minutes on Wikipedia or better yet cracking open a Bible and reading a bit of the Old Testament.,Zionism,cwu0o7d,4,t5_2qovq

6663145,0,t1_d08isyq,but the settlements are segregated and the settlers attack surrounding palestinain communities several time each week.. i dont really think the settlers want to live next to the palestinians if they really wanted to live alongside palestinians why are they burning down palestinian houses and olive trees I mean its pretty obvious that the settlements are the biggest obstacle to building a palestinian state. continuing the settlements is basically a big fuck you.. its basically saying this is our land not yours ,Zionism,d08iynq,1,t5_2qovq

8108041,0,t1_d4qndyv,Your account was new so our automoderator autobanned your comment sorry Ive since approved it and you should be free to post anywhere on rZionism without any trouble now.As for your post there certainly were some Khazars who decided to convert to Judaism but its completely asinine to suggest that this is where ALL of modern day Ashkenazi Jews come from. Its simply yet another point of attack to make it seem as though JEws are not actually semitic and that The palestinians are the REAL semites! etc etc. Its really unfortunate that this conversation is always shrouded in someone trying to essentially disconnect Jews from the land of Israel when itd be nice to have the Khazar conversation from a purely historical standpoint without having it be against Zionism.,Zionism,d4rf0b2,1,t5_2qovq
