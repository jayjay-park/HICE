4142131,0,t1_crsdng5,because not everybody spends all day on the internet and not everybody knows how to work reddit specifically to your liking. why dont you post a quick stepbystep tutorial so that people will know isntead of just bitching about it?also i have followed a few different sets of directions to do so and have the most recent version of chrome and it just doesnt work. so yeah.,CumFarting,crsf53g,-5,t5_2uofa
4162116,0,t1_crsdng5,Because Ive been away on courses with work a few days and only had my phone. Doing reverse image searches on mobile is possible but a chore compared to on the computer and people should learn to list sources. Not just because of wanting to find the artist for more good times but also out of respect to the content creator. ,CumFarting,cruovt0,2,t5_2uofa
