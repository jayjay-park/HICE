You may or may not know but the previous Papa was not entirely fulfilled with the fame and fortune brought upon by the success of Ghost.

11322787,0,t1_dff9l83,There are two ways you can split credits for song writing. Split it even  no matter how much each part has contributed or have an intraband contract. Look at the band U. They split it even between the band members even though the drummer hasnt written a single line riff or solo. But he has been a part of the creative process. Look at The Beatles. All songwriting credits are split between Lennon and McCartney. Does that mean the contributed exactly  each in all songs?The music industry doesnt work like that.We dont know how much Omega contributed. We dont know how much Klas hlund contributed. The band probably doesnt know it themselves. Sure if the had a contract where they stopped the creative process every time someone came up with something and wrote that in a contract we might find out one day. But I highly doubt Ghost has done it that way.We know for a fact several people contributed to the songwriting. We also know for a fact these people arent around the band anymore. Will that effect how the songs in the future will turn out? Im sure it will. That is my point.,Ghostbc,dfff3bv,1,t5_2wt3j

You mentioned not making a profit due to band expenses lightspyrostage equipment. If this is the case then tf SHOULD have received the same financial gain as the  ghouls. If records show he has taken any different amount of monies than the ghouls he will most likely be sued for those wages duedamages. ,Ghostbc,dfxd4b6,6,t5_2wt3j

I think its great that you have translated all the docs for non Swedish speakers and I dont condone the people sending you threatening messages. But for me the ghost sub is for keeping the magic and the papa and ghouls sub is for discussing the band members. Its like having a sub for a film and all people talk about is the drama between the actors. Thank you for the translation work.

11772572,0,t1_dgu50qr,TF could in no way be ousted from Ghost. If anything hed have to pay the former members whats due. The lawsuit said that its not on paper that the band was a partnership and even if it were TF is still a partner. But none of that matters because TF can still release new material and that would be ridiculous for him to not do so because of this lawsuit. Like whats already been said AXs lawsuit is over them owing Warner Bros. another album yet they still released The Stage under Capitol Records. It would be incredibly stupid of TF to not release new material over this because if the lawsuit does take years then Ghosts popularity and marketing would dwindle over X amount of time.,Ghostbc,dgugcib,3,t5_2wt3j
