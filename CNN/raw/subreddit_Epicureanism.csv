1552315,0,t1_cjal08y,Unfortunately I dont have much of anything by Philodemus. I generally rely on secondary commentaries of his work. That epigram is something I saw on the Stanford Philosophy site and loved. I too lack the money to buy any of the translations available on Amazon.,Epicureanism,cjautun,1,t5_31lrd

6896386,0,t1_czj2qv4,Im inclined to agree with most of your positions but I do disagree specifically with your moral skepticism. I believe as I think Epicurus would in moral realism derived via negative hedonism. That is the empirical senses of suffering anxiety or pain are sensory proof of evil. Much like the mind being an emergent property of matter morality is also an emergent property of matter. Good is the base state of painfree sensation or qualia. ,Epicureanism,d0y0vbo,1,t5_31lrd

7851949,0,t3_4mvgqr,Abstractgt The Cyrenaics assert that  particular pleasure is the highest good and happiness is valued not for its own sake but only for the sake of the particular pleasures that compose it  we should not forego present pleasures for the sake of obtaining greater pleasure in the future. Their antieudaimonism and lack of futureconcern do not follow from their hedonism nor from their maximizing model of rationality contra Annas since the natural position to adopt if one has a maximizing hedonism is Socrates prudent hedonism as described in the Protagoras. So why do they assert  and ? After reviewing and criticizing the proposals put forward by Irwin and Tsouna I offer two possible reconstructions. In the first I explain claim  as follows happiness has no value above and beyond the value of the particular pleasures that compose it. Also there is no structure to happiness. The Cyrenaics are targeting the thesis that happiness involves having the activities of ones life forming an organized whole the value of which cannot be reduced to the value of the experiences within that life. I explain claim  as follows a maximally pleasant life is valuable but the best way to achieve it is to concentrate heedlessly on the present. In the second reconstruction the good is radically relativized to ones present preferences. The Cyrenaics assert that we desire some particular pleasure e.g. the pleasure that results from having this drink now. Thus our teloswhich is based upon our desiresis this particular  pleasure not generic pleasure or the maximization of pleasure over our lifetime. As our desires change so does our telos. I conclude that the scanty texts we have do not allow us to decide conclusively between these reconstructions but I give some reasons to support the second over the first.,Epicureanism,d3ymnsi,1,t5_31lrd
9719129,0,t3_5eai9m,I think either of your options is perfectly Epicurean and it depends on the person as to which is better. Epicurus had quite a lot to say about appetites and desires. But once the pain of a desire is gone then there is little pleasure in pursuing it further. So whatever fills the stomach is good enough...But one of my favourite Epicurus quotes as told by Seneca isgtYou must reflect carefully beforehand with whom you are to eat and drink rather than what you are to eat and drink. For a dinner of meats without the company of a friend is like the life of a lion or a wolf. So as long as your family is together then that is the best part of the meal.,Epicureanism,dab3dxa,11,t5_31lrd
