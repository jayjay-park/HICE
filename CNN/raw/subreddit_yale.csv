If you forget to apologize for vomiting in your interviewers lap send a letter when you return home NOT an email apology.

5984058,0,t1_cy3bmzr,Im pretty sure Odojas wasnt claiming that there are no exceptions to the First Amendment. Everyone knows that not all speech is protected. Pointing out that some speech is unprotected is not an argument that any particular instance of expression is unprotected.In fact speech is presumptively protected and loses protection only if it falls into one of the recognized exceptions. For several decades now the Supreme Court has been extremely hostile toward arguments in favor of adding new exceptions. The Court refused to create an exception for hateful and offensive speech just a few years ago see Snyder v. Phelps the Westboro Baptist case.,yale,cy41i5v,7,t5_2roag

11181678,0,t3_5ziusx,East Rock is a nice quiet and safe place. Its not really that hard to have a good social life if you live there its  min walk from downtown. East Rock is full of grad studentspostdocprofessors many of whom work on nearby Science Hill but its sort of like a suburban residential area. Theres not very many venues to meet people there.One of the coolest features about East Rock is that its close to East Rock which is a rock formation left by retreating glaciers. East Rock is a beautiful place filled with trees to go hiking or running. However since you are going to spending most of your time at the med school Id recommended getting a place more downtown where the med school is. Subletting during the summer to figure things out is a great idea!,yale,dezfic3,4,t5_2roag
