11573376,0,t1_dg7tszo,If it will become too hard to reach a consensus here IMHO the LoL subreddit is a bit comparable to our situation. The people in their are naturally hostile towards each other but the sub is a rather decen tplace despite its size.They have this explanation regarding evidenceIn particulargt . People can harm others just with a rumor or outright lie. It doesnt matter whether the rumor is true or false some people will believe the rumor and pass it along. We do not want to help any unsubstantiated claims that might cause real harm to people who did absolutely nothing wrong.gt . Readers need to be able to evaluate the case being made to see whether or not it is compelling. Hard to do that unless evidence of a claim is presented. The person being accused vaguely of wrongdoing also cant combat that accusation without being able to interact with the evidence being provided.,LegacyRealms,dg7ujnz,1,t5_3jzxl

People would help us out that dont even play WoW.They would have no interest. We just need to be sure to find a mediator type of person.,LegacyRealms,dgf9eez,1,t5_3jzxl
