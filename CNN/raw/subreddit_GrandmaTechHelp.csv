Many people my age dont even bother to change their oil they just want things to magically work without any upkeep or maintenance.Fortunately your computer shouldnt need regular maintenance in the same way a car does. There are very few moving parts in a computer and many of them are so simple that the only way they might fail is from years of dust buildup.What kind of computerlaptop do you have? Depending on what youre using we might be more helpful with certain kinds of advice. Computers can overheatComputers and laptops both have fans in them to help keep their internals cool. These are usually hidden behind grates or vents for the purpose of aesthetics and so many people never think about a computers cooling needs.Many times Ive seen people put a computer in an enclosed box or leave a laptop on a soft fabric cushion laptop vents are usually on the bottom and easily blocked and Im silently horrified at the sight of the poor computer quietly suffocating on its own hot air. Computer connections can be damaged through routine useIf you have a laptop this is a common problem with the power cable  it gets tugged every so often and eventually the metal within the computer is fatigued and bent so badly that it no longer charges the laptop.The Golden Rule of Electronics is If it doesnt fit dont force it. If a moderate force isnt enough to fit a plug into a socket it probably wasnt meant to go that way.The good news is that unless youre exceptionally rough with your laptop this probably isnt an issue. Computers can catch virusesYour computer runs programs  most of those programs are beneficial ones like your internet browser your email or your word processor.Unfortunately a computer runs any instructions its given regardless of their goal or purpose. Sometimes a program makes its way onto your computer that was written by a hacker or some other malicious third party.Typically the first tipoff that your computer has been infected is that its running slowly. If programs start appearing or disappearing if things dont seem to behave the same as they did previously or if you notice popup windows that dont seem normal those are also good signs that something is up.Viruses usually come from web pages or downloads  its best to be skeptical of anything that appears to be an advertisement especially if it sounds too good to be true or if its alarmist. General rule of the internet the harder something seems to be trying to grab your attention the less deserving of your attention it usually is. This holds true for advertisements images news articles everything.How can you clean a virus off your computer? Places like Best Buy and Staples will happily remove viruses but theyll often charge a good amount and try their hardest to sell you additional junk you dont need.One thing thats helpful is called a System Restore Point. Its like a reset button go back to the System Restore Point and your computer will go back to how it was when the point was made. Any changes made since that point will be lost  viruses and programs alike.,GrandmaTechHelp,cm3uc1f,2,t5_34ftm
