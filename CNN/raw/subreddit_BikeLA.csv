1017287,0,t3_25pm4t,You have the right to the lane but if you see a driver waiting to turn right its common courtesy to pull your bike over and let them do so.Youre allowed to turn right on red here so it is kind of a drag to have to wait for the light to change just because a cyclist cant move his bike over a couple of feet.That said its not a bad strategy for the lights with bad sensors as cars are more likely to trigger the light change.,BikeLA,chjx814,3,t5_2ry2s
