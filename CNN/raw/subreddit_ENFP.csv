157576,0,t1_cevledz,Yeah. If you can point out what flaw Im making or what information Im not taking into accountand explain why I should be taking it into account I will not only admit Im wrong but thank you for it. The problem is that when people make emotional arguments they are doing a lot of projecting. People have a tenancy to forget that not all situations effect every persons emotions the same way and that you cant convince someone into feeling the same way you do. Its much easier to think about things in terms of what place the players inhabit in space time what information they are exchanging and what the rules of the game are. All arguments should be discussed operationally and without any isness. This looks like changing a statement from you are being an ass to I feel like you are being an ass when you do X. When the argument has been reframed this way and all emotions are recognized as valid by both sides the argument usually resolves itself. This wouldnt have been the case when I was  though. I was raised to have an obsession with being right. The only kind of positive reinforcement I got when I was younger is when I was right and most smart people went through the same experience. A lot of young and less developed INTJs hinge their emotional worth and whether or not they are right. In my s I realized that there are no right answers and every time I think I have one I get into trouble. Im constantly in the search for more powerful more useful models without getting emotionally attached to them. Thats the ideal anyways and it rarely works out that way in reality. Im positive there is still plenty of garbage buried deep that is going to get drawn to the surface eventually. ,ENFP,cewdomh,4,t5_2r4yi

314477,0,t3_1xogu7,Thats so weird you said the ADHD thing. I take pills for it and they really help. Focus is hard for a guy like me. I just get bored suuuuper easily and lose track of my thoughts so notetaking is a must.That aside for long term goals it may seem overwhelming at first. You gotta break it up into small things and set baby step attainable achievements. Theres this Stickies app on my computer that I keep a list of things I want to achieve. One stickie has a long list of long term shit. One has daily things I can do whenever I have time. And a bunch of others with random things like go get an oil change next week etc.. So whenever Im just sitting around and feel like being productive I just look at the little notes and pick something. Sometimes youre not in the mood to do a huge project so you can pick something small sometimes you get super inspired and have tons of energy so you can pick something big. As long as youre being productive in any small way toward achieving you goals it all adds up in the end and you eventually get there. ,ENFP,cfdd518,3,t5_2r4yi

That was the beginning of the end for us.God I feel for you on this. I rarely buy really special presents for anyone as they usually involve a lot of thought and consideration and I refuse to do superficial swagthrowaway presents just for the sake of showing up with things.I had the same feeling one time after learning my spouse had lost a special set of earrings I had bought as a belated wedding present. Theyd been left laying around...not after wearing just left around. Im one of those people who has valuables in wellused but mint condition for years so possessions arent the point but the value and effort it took to choose and acquire them.Its funny because some people I know would laugh at the same situation you describe tell the person they are not cut out to be partners and move on without shedding a tear.

Also theres the problem of stress. When a person is under stress their primary function takes a back seat and negative versions of their shadow functions come out to play. The strongest function ideal gives way to the secondary function okay which gives way to the tertiary function not great and finally leaves the weakest function bad news. Its fun to type fictional characters but stressedout damaged ones take a lot of effort.

If you cant afford it try to make some money and invest in it.  Waking up each day with a positive outlook instead of dreading getting out of bed is priceless.

I teach classes tutor individuals and give presentations to local schools on behalf of my company big national test prep company.I get to meet so many different types of people teenagers and adults people for whom the ish class fee is a huge commitment and people who can easily afford  an hour for tutoring student athletes who just need to meet a schools bareminimum requirements and straightA students shooting for a perfect score.Ive been teaching for the same company in the same city for eight years now so my reputation has grown to the point that my name brings business to the company and I pretty much get my pick of assignments so I make my own schedule and can often reschedule things pretty easily if Im having a bad day.The worst part of my job is the driving avg.  minutes a day but I get to check out different parts of the city and suburbs and get inside some really really nice and interesting houses.The part I straightup DREAD though is the paperwork payroll expense reports etc.. Im a pretty outstanding employee in every area except for getting stupid mundane stuff turned in on time and it makes me look like an idiot because its really just like  minutes of work a week and I turn it in to fulltime desk employees who usually only see me come in all enthusiastic and energized something so they assume that I could surely spare energy on just a tiny fraction of the work they do all day but Id rather teach all damn day than have a min paperwork assignment. So I often put it off too long and turn in stuff late and all at once and that causes friction with the office but honestly I do so well at everything else so they kind of have to just accept it. Overall its an awesome job because I get to inspire so many people about something very few of them would ever hope to get excited about. Standardized test scores really help ease open doors of opportunity and I love helping people channel their energy into the test and see it as a positive learning experience rather than some dumb administrative roadblock.,ENFP,coof5ra,3,t5_2r4yi

3240284,0,t3_2x79d6,I have to mirror the other commenters spontaneous acts of attention and statements of feelings are the way to go. And sometimes I know I can be a little dense. For example if someone calls me beautiful it can go right in one ear and out the other. But if someone takes a picture of me while Im minding my own business and then shows it to me saying look at how beautiful you are. I friggen melt. The amount of money you put into a gift is also probably meaningless. But the effort it takes you and knowing that it is unique to me and my likes...gets huge points. So teddy bears are the most pointless space wasters and expensive jewelry makes me self conscious especially since I dont wear it but a replacement pack of bobby pins that I never have on hand? Swoon. You know me.Basically let me know that you pay attention to me when Im not in your face with my usual song and dance. Straight up I do have an insecurity that Im just not special enough to stick around in someones head after Ive left the room. Let your ENFP know with words and actions that she doesnt disappear in the long distance that her presence lingers that shes made a unique and special impact on you. If you dont let her know shes unforgettable her default will be to assume she is forgettable. Repeating things isnt fake for an ENFP. Were dynamic creatures whos feelings wax and wane all the time. Its confirmation that everyone is on the same page. Ive heard that ENFPs treat love like roses while some other types treat love like a diamond. The diamond is forever and nothing can scratch it. But even if the rose bush is in near perfect conditions it still needs regular care and upkeep to keep it healthy. ,ENFP,coxv21t,5,t5_2r4yi

3417595,0,t3_2zbpvm,Used to do drugs to escape reality broke into a family members house to take their prescription meds. Two horrible breakupsbreakupsThe first... I had just turned  had been talking to this one girl well call her Maria. So we were both in a school musical Oklahoma!...I was Will Parker and thats when I decided that I wasnt totally over the girl that I was in love with previously. Note I used to be super depressed and I had been cutting myself because of the previous chick. I switched from a charter school to the one Id normally go to because of this. Anyway I became super cold because Id never actually dated anyone before at that point and I didnt know what to do. She ended up screaming at me during a rehearsal. I was so selfishly cold. The second one was after I became a Christian not really a believer anymore though. This one girl and I had really liked each other for a while and eventually decided to move forward with it and called it a relationship. But her parents wereare insane...and insanely controlling. They were like NOPE WERE CRAZY YOU GUYS ARENT ALLOWED TO SEE EACH OTHER AT ALL OR TALK TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE. So after months of trying to stay together and all but not being able to talk rookie mistake righhh? I decided to ask if I  could call her and break it off... because I had to ask. To freaking do that. So yeah...felt really bad because she basically idolized me. Not a good situation. Dont hope to ever see her again. Just because its so so awkward. I do feel bad about it but...so awkward... Anyway I feel horrible about all thee of those things still. Mostly the first one. I feel like I dont even know myself sometimes since I would be willing to do that. I wouldnt do it again though obviously. I just feel so so bad about it. So bad. But now Im different.  I was an introvert then. Things changed. Acting and Christianity got me out of introversion and I became a much more positive person.Another side note is that I dont trust the MBTI...its like a horoscope in the sense that all the descriptions are pretty positive and agreeable.

I think there are three bits of advice Id give based on what youve said Based on what youve said about yourself you sound like a pretty cool dude.  Honestly you sound like the type of person I tend to be friends with given your interests and personality type A large percentage of my friends are INTJs and ISTJ.  Dont compromise your interests in the hopes of finding a gf who wouldnt want those.  Youll end up becoming someone you dont like.  Be confident in who you are and even if youre not the most outgoing guy that confidence will be apparent in the way you carry yourself.  Get yourself out there.  That doesnt mean throwing yourself at a girl and asking her out.  I doubt thats anywhere near your comfort zone. What might help is gradually expanding your comfort zone.  Give yourself small achievable goals involving talking to people you dont know as wellat all. Dont feel bad about not having had a gf or about not having one now.  Some things take time.

Then move on to integration. Master them. Then the rest is just conceptual stuff. Related rates?

In my experience people somewhat want clones of themselves.Theory I have is that we all judge each other by our strongest attributes. So someone who is a good dresser judges other people by their dress sense. Someone who is punctual judges others who are not punctual. I think its a sanity thing to make sure we feel worthwhile.The person telling you this perceives their strength is their ability to be ruthless so dont take it as a criticism take it as them trying to help you. Theyre kind of right in that the non authoritarian approach you value for yourself doesnt work for everyone. Some people havent earned it.Demonstrate to them that youve taken their advice on board and make sure they know that some action youve taken is because of their inspiring advice.

Ill just leave this nuggetHuman beings are not naturally egalitarian. It is human nature to provide for self and family first.We arent like other mammals. Were creative were intuitive were innovative. In order to maintain these traits in society we need incentive. Why? Because being innovative is great by itself but if it doesnt provide for self and family then why try and be innovative?When other people see theres a reward in being innovative it drives them to pursue innovation. We dont stop at just food or shelter because weve moved beyond that. We can now safely crave and get superficial things.No capitalism isnt perfect and it carries frivolity but its brought us to where we are now. Most of the great inventions of the last  years were engineered with the knowledge there was a reward at the end of the tunnel.Socialism in theory is nice but human beings naturally learn to and do exploit the system.,ENFP,csbau8m,3,t5_2r4yi

5048140,0,t3_3jrjei,Without fail the two best things you can do to get work done Do work with others nearby who will hold you accountable Be just a little bit too swamped with workAs long as the other people you are working with or working in the same area as ALSO are busy with their own studies they shouldnt distract you. In fact you will feel the social pressure to look busy and get your work done because ENFPs are nothing without our egos. When I am working near other people even if I am not directly engaged with them I am more comfortable and at ease than being alone. In fact Ive found that the opposite extreme i.e. siloing myself off in the deepest quietest compartment of the library only makes me less effective because I get stir crazy jump on FB or Imgur or get distracted by a book shelf about existentialists or Greek erotic art or some such thing this has happened so so so many times. You want to be swamped so that you literally have no time to procrastinate! For example my senior year was my most successful year of college academically but also my busiest! Why? Because I said YOLO to my senior year. I led a club started a small business and acted in plays. Further I had my toughest course load to date. The result was that I had a low supply of time and as such my time became more valuable. Mind you I had time enough to study sleep workout occasionally and watch a show or two on the weekend but consistent deadlines meant that my mind was logical and forward thinking rather than being procrastination prone.

Never satisfied things could always be better so Ive only sought out stuff where I have at least a decent amount of control and power to change things. Getting very very restless again and Im not even  months into this IT job. I dont see any scope. My previous job was help desk  it made me feel absolutely useless. My current IT job is still entertaining but not enough. Never enough. On a whim I decided to download a college level anatomy text book because I had to get that med school monkey off my back  dont think thats ever really going to leave me and had some rather unpleasant flashbacks to bio. And I realize even  years ago I never liked the sciences enough to work on them and excel be it chem bio or physics. It was different around  years ago when Id latched on to the rather fancy idea of hey lets be a doctor and help people!. I cant really stand people  they are exhausting. Small talk is exhausting. I dont like helping individuals much. I dont believe that the world can be saved one person at a time and think one needs a lot and lot of money to actually see meaningful change that can be sustained. I like people as an abstract concept something about making the world a better place but I dont like commitment I dont like dealing with users I hate messy human emotions I hate that people have so much control over my mental states and energy meditating might help but im far too impatient Id rather watch copious amounts of television get caught up in mysteries or think my way out of different boxes solving different problems getting instant gratification. I suppose anything even medicine can be thought of in nothing but abstract problems to be solved there is no person just a set of symptoms and your success or failure depends on catching these and treating these. Let others worry about feelings.  Life looks to be a process of elimination but the path to getting to good places  elusive. Accepting Ill never ever be happy that my happy states come in a few flavors  engaged entertained or euphoric. Being content angry or apathetic  those are not good states for me. For a person like me its never going to be one career. Back to tech. Its got enough problems for me to fix but I need a new place and a new set of problems. Im tired looking at the same landscape and people with their petty tiffs and myriads of social cues Im not capable of catching and navigating through.

They arent really that bad of fights but they are annoying and it does just generate some tensionenergy that wasnt there before. For those reasons I wouldnt consider ending the relationship because its just that were more comfortable around each other and in effect its easier to fight about things.

The reason why I see people say they dont want to change the definition of marriage is because they think it will lead to polygamy becoming legal eventually. At that point you have to ask what marriage even means they say. So its not really based on religious beliefs or so they claim. But what defines hateful? Imagine for a second that someone decides that all religion is hateful and gets a law passed that says religion gets in the way of pursuit of happiness. Its like a dystopian setting waiting to happen. A huge part of my belief is that when you take responsibility away from people they will act less responsible.

TWO of my best friends are guys that I went on one date with and despite there being either no chemistry or just circumstantially not working out I just kept them around. One of them went on to meet an awesome girl and married her a few months later. They moved around the corner from me and I hang out with them regularly. The other kind of works with me now  I got him a gig with someone I work with.Point is I love connecting with people even in a platonic way after the relationship way has proven to not work. ,ENFP,cx30fma,1,t5_2r4yi

5715354,0,t3_3tc532,eeyyyoooo female software eng here. Sometimes the environment this field generates is easier to deal with than what youre describing... and sometimes its really not. gt lack of positive social interactionsThis is what always eats at me the worst. I can deal with shade thrown by just about anyone if I have positive relationships to focus on instead but if I feel like I dont have anyone who understands it can get really bad. The important thing is to find the good people  and they do exist. Even if theyre the passive ones and you still have to do the speaking up fighting for someone can make you feel so much stronger. You mentioned friends in the cohort but it sounds like theres nobody there you trust. If you find someone you can trust to help turn your overanalysis into accurate analysis or at the least to validate your observations itll go miles.gt Not so much problem solving the inappropriate remark but internally  what can I do so that this isnt bothering me as much as it is?This kind of thing will weigh on me until I address it or until something stronger happens to wipe it out. If you need to you can directly call this comment out  even if its days too late even if someone laughs at you for caring so much  and youll have done the right thing.gt All of the girls were offended by the comment. Some think doing anything about it is pointless.Its never pointless. Its often exhausting and  to be frank  sometimes genuinely not worth the effort but this guy has zero chance of seeing the light on his own and if he doesnt he will make the same kind of cruel comment to someone else later probably someone who cant deal with it as well as you can. You are RIGHT ON with your inappropriate and paying to learn analyses. Unfortunately tech environments arent good at rewarding empathy and punishing cruelty the way more socially apt circles are and nobodys come up with a way to cram kindness down someones throat. Its hard to correct this behavior but its harder to live with it.Was this dude a fellow student? This is a long shot but is there a TAinstructor whos sympathetic to the cause and would take half an hour out of the coding lecture to address the importance and frankly appalling state of inclusionsensitivitydiversity in the tech world? There is a wealth of discussion going on right now. One of the best primer  articles Ive come across is Ways Men In Tech Are Unintentionally Sexist  it primarily deals with behavior more subtle than what you experienced but does a good job addressing why the general category is tricky and also very very important.Finally in your obviously massive amounts of free time so more likely if youre tuning out during lecture it helps to read as much as you can written by women talking about similar situations theyve been in. Often its more depressing than inspiring but the worst part about the diversity in tech situationproblem is that its a really young discussion and nobodys figured out what to do about it or even has promising ideas. Gather as much information as you can knowledge is ammunition and if you find something that helps you can share it. The Systers mailing list is a great lowcommitment resource for this.I wish you luck in your social endeavors and also in your coding ones and I hope I havent made the field sound too bleak! Coding is really rewarding personally AND professionally  it just takes more effort than usual to find a healthy environment. There are plenty of good and strong people working to make it better and youre one of them ,ENFP,cx5jn5s,3,t5_2r4yi

5997596,0,t3_3xm76i,Being an ENFP we get a bulk of our energy from inspiring and being inspired. What I recommend you do is find a way to get yourself involved with something that may inspire others. Do challenging things that involve a lot of work. Research on how to build your social media networks with the intention of inspiring others. Make friends that want to do the same. And maybe try to find a solid career that involves philanthropy. Youre low on energy because you havent been able to really use your characteristics and need to surround yourself with more people that are influential.Most importantly try to connect with yourself and try to avoid escapism as much as possible. Us ENFPs tend to do a lot of great things to fill a void and run away from ourselves or personal problems. More often than not the clues are in what we do for others being a reflection of what we should or subconsciously desire to do for ourselves. ,ENFP,cy5tdl5,4,t5_2r4yi
6043929,0,t3_3y79cy,Hey I dont know if this will help you but I have had lots of the same expiriences. What helped me alot was to travel just like you said you wanted to. I lived in Australia for  months then went to the states for a year then I lived in London for half a year then to small town in Norway for half a year and now I live in Oslo soon starting my second year of College. Dont let the expectations get to you just do what is close to your heart and you will expirience selfactualization to a certain point. This will really calm you down and help you stay more motivated beause you know in your heart that you have done what has been closest to your heart. It doesnt mean that you have to travel the world but go on an adventure. Do something out of the box and impress yourself. It really made me calm and not so restless. I know this comment might not be the right answer for you or for other ENFPs but it made my inner adventure take a nap at least for a while which made me more motivated for school work family etc. ,ENFP,cybv849,2,t5_2r4yi

Ive always been the oldest child and my little siblings all  of them are  years younger than me. I basically though my whole life that I was an introvert because I had to be around people  which was way too much indeed and I used to value every second I could spend alone. Just a year ago I moved to different city and felt first time in my life like I need socializing or Ill go nuts D What a weird feeling...!What helps tremendously is headphones and good music. If you can find a room where you can be alone without someone barging in every few second put on your headphones and listen to music that makes you happy and energized possibly drink a cup of tea and do something you would do in your own room i.e. read a bookinternet articles drawcolour something etc. Thats what I did and still do when Im staying at my parents house in the holidays. Immerse yourself to the music and forget all that noise coming from the room next door I personally like to listen to glitch hop and The Fat Rat especially is something I can whole heartedly recommend or Young the Giant which isnt glitch hop though... or huge amount of other bands I listen to P. Also enjoy the silence when your nephews are outside. Go outside when the noise inside your parents house gets so unbearable that you cant enjoylisten to music.

7440636,0,t3_4h71kv,Hey! ENFP  here and maybe this will help.Step  MAKE A GOOGLE CALENDAR! This has saved my butt numerous times. I usually put the weekly workload in and whatever I need to do. Its a reminder of what deadlines I have and what I have to do each dayStep  Set goals for yourself and make deadlines where you might fail if you dont work towards those goals. Im a drummer and my biggest boosts are when I have a gig and that big song comes up and its do or die for me. Id rather not die so I put in the work and it makes the gig and future ones easier for me.Step  Remember to relax but dont get too relaxed. Create the schedule and pace yourself so its not all crazy in one day but its staggered. Itll make the work more bearable and you can go to sleep easier knowing you worked on a thing.Hopefully this helps. Im usually a really stressed out guy with a lot on my plate and although I become really blitzed and unresponsive i.e. these past few weeks because finals and other gubbins life throws at you the schedule helps. It takes a few moments to do to get the general schedule and the rest fills itself in as it comes up. You got this just stick to your guns and do what you want to do and set goals to get it done!EDIT Just clearing some stuff my phone autocorrected incorrectly,ENFP,d2nyat7,2,t5_2r4yi

7648234,0,t1_d3bbmq9,Thank you! Im pretty proud of it. The filmmaker is amazing!I kinda fell into voiceover accidentally. I started out doing a bunch of amateur voice work as a fun and very secret hobby. Theres a ton of avenues online for people wishing to get into the amateur voice acting scene. Radio play reproductions. Podcasts etc. The whole time I was doing this I was getting more and more invested in the microphone equipment and the technical stuff behind the scenes. I wound up buying some nicesounding gear and learning how to mix and edit. After a few years of upgrading my studio bitbybit I started to wonder if maybe I might be able to start earning some money. I started out slow but gradually built up to a point where I was working enough to be able to quit my day job. I still have months where I spend weeks in a cold sweat wondering how the hell Im going to pay my rent! But largely Im doing pretty well.My experience is pretty meandering. It probably took around  or  years to go from starting out to where I am now. But I know of others who have taken a more direct approach  gotten coaching and training etc. I think theres no right or wrong way. If you wanna know more feel free to PM me. Happy to Skype and talk about voiceover stuff if youre interested!,ENFP,d3bk90e,1,t5_2r4yi
7663413,0,t3_4k7n6m,Over the years Ive learned how to develop my intuition.I think the development of my intuition started with depression and anxiety. In order to defeat those I had to take a very honest look at myself and understand the causes of why I felt the way I felt. It took years but that depression was a catalyst for selfunderstanding.  I felt misunderstood mostly because I didnt even understand myself. So how could anybody else understand me? So I did psychoanalysis mindfulness meditation Eckhart Tolle style and went on a philosophical journey to learn about ethics and developed my own ethical views that werent just based on cultural programming or what I was taught as a child. Ultimately I believe intuition starts with selfunderstanding. Like that quote Man know thyself and you shall know the universe.  Once I started understanding my own feelings instead of suppressing them or projecting them onto others I started understand why others feel the way that they do. It allowed me to develop empathy from others and to see life through their perspective.  I have a natural inclination to study psychology and some forms of occultism both of which take interesting approaches to understanding human nature. To be intuitive is to be in touch with your emotions and your own consciousness. It means that you can experience emotion without being knocked down by it and then analyze the source of the emotions that you experience by using logic. Intuition implies that theres a symbiosis between the emotive and logical faculties of the mind and they work together to uncover knowledge and truths that were otherwise unknown had they not worked together. The ability to tap into that source of wisdom is using your intuition. The following are some practices that help me continuously develop it  Regular journaling writing down without any sort of filter on your words  exactly what you feel and what youre dealing with.  Imagine that you had an imaginary best friend with whom you can retreat into the depths of your mind and tell them everything with radical vulnerability and oppenness. Dont leave things out and dont censor yourself. All of your feelings are valid and real and you want to write as much as possible about them.  Higher Self or Therapeutic Journaling In this type of journaling I switch gears. This practice involves me tapping into my higher self. Basically I imagine myself if I was achieving all of my goals and dreams and a perfectly integrated individual. I call her Future Me. Then I imagine myself as a tiny child vulnerable and needing of all the love and nurturing.  I call her Little Me. This type of journaling Future Me gives advice to Little Me. Future Me is a wise sage a cheerleader a mother figure a caretaker. She talks to Little Me in a loving yet stern way and helps Conglomerate Me my ego self recalibrate internally.  Dream Journaling My third mode is to write down my dreams as often as possible. This is an active way of tapping into the intuition since youre literally recording your subconscious.  Then I go back and do Jungianstyle dream analysis where I put my dreams in perspective with my waking emotions and whats going on with my life. This is a really powerful way to integrate the subconscious with the conscious increasing your intuitive powers. Good luck!,ENFP,d3dabku,12,t5_2r4yi

7984262,0,t1_d4d7jy1,Thats awesome that you are familiar with Agile!!  As an ENFP Im really drawn to it.  It gives me enough structure to tame a bit of the chaos while still giving the freedom to do things my way. One thing that is HUGE for me is that Im a very visual person.  Out of sight out of mind.  Agile stresses visual reminders and indicators of progress which I find super helpful.  For example if there is a task Im supposed to do but dont write it down it will always be floating around in the back of my mind making me feel guilty for not doing it but I never think of it when I have the time to do it.  Having my tasks be physical cards on my board helps me know what needs to be done when Im planning my day.  Another part of what I like about Agile is that it helps set clear expectations.  This is a big deal for me as I REALLY want to please others and do a good job but feel uneasy when I dont know what the expectations and boundaries are.  Maybe something as simple as a chore chart that he can check off everyday will help get the habit going.  For me just being secure in the idea that someones not going to come yelling at me out of the blue for not doing something is priceless.As far as personality and age I will say this  I was a SLOB until my midtolate s.  I still struggle sometimes but Ive gotten a lot better.  The main thing thats changed is that Ive realized that I can either spend  hours on a weekend doing all of the dishes for the week or I can spend  minutes each night before bed loading the dishwasher and  minutes in the morning putting them away.  Im much happier with the  minutes.   I used the tiny habits method to start the habit although I didnt know about this talk at the time.  I told myself  After my dinner TV show is over I will do the dishes and start the machine.  For really hard things I added and then I can have reward. Last thing  As far as your concern with children goes  I hear you!  I have this same struggle with my husband over different things though.  I know the last thing we want to think is that were training our men but... sometimes they need it.  Heck sometimes I need it... everyone struggles with SOMETHING.  Dont think of it as training but helping him be a better adult.  Many of us come out of HS or college with no idea at all how to adult were just figuring it out as we go.  If he wasnt raised to be selfsufficient doesnt sound like he was hes going to have to learn that now as an adult.  Unfortunately that means its going to fall on you to help him correct that damage. As his partner part of your job is to help him be the best man he can be and viceversa IMO.  Youre a team and team members push each other forward.  Think of this as experience for when you do have children whether with him or not on how to communicate and encourage someone else to do whats in their own best interest anyway.  If you had a child right now that was at an age where you wanted to start giving them chores and responsibilities how would you go about it?  Im not saying to treat him like a child really but the same techniques may work regardless of age.  Chore charts doing things together especially if he legitimately doesnt know how to do things and tiny habits can all help.  He will forget sometimes or do it wrong but if he trusts you to not blow up about it and to be patient with him it will get better.  DTLDR  He needs you to help him J for a while but in a supportive let me help you find your own system way not a do what I tell you way.  Be patient.  Visual reminders help A LOT.,ENFP,d4di8uv,3,t5_2r4yi

8132047,0,t3_4qlsnx,Hi M ENFP here. I had a relationship that ended a couple years ago for this same reason. We had been together for over  years. Periodically Id get that itch for affection which always led me to having a talk with her about at least needing some reciprocation. Unfortunately it was not in her nature to reciprocate and she would always try to reassure me that her coldness was not reflective of her feelings for me. Alas this explanation never seemed to calm my nerves and always left me feeling like a blind guy feeling his way through a complex labyrinth of a relationship.If theres anything I learned from that grueling experience its that there are some people who just cannot support you in the way you need and that is something an ENFP must ask them self if they are willing to accept or not.Unfortunately for me when I asked myself this same question I told myself I would accept the situation likely due to my low self esteem at the time and all that got me was an unhealthy relationship that lasted WAY too long and ended horribly. If you ever find yourself in this same situation please for the sake of your mental and emotional health make a decision that will keep you sane and whole!,ENFP,d4u45t6,11,t5_2r4yi

But in the middle of my undergrad I befriended a girl who wanted to hang out with me on a consistent basis. Few weeks later she ended up asking me to go steady. Today almost  years later we rent an apartment together in a different city from where we met. Its not all fun and games all the time and I wouldnt say we are absolutely enthralled by each other but we do love each other very much.ampnbsp My first advice to you is keep looking and dont give up! My second advice is to learn to embrace selfimprovement in all its facets Master your physical body master your finances and master your mind by disciplining your thoughts and emotions. Instead of looking for the perfect girlfriend become a person worthy of being called the perfect boyfriend. Invest in yourself first and others will eventually follow.Good luck!,ENFP,d52krum,2,t5_2r4yi

8405541,0,t1_d5s7obq,Feminists definitely have made dramatic changes in the political and social world for many groups that may have formerly been considered secondclass which is why I specified modern feminism. I wouldnt dream of downplaying that fact.Im actually glad you brought up the topic of selfcensorship. Im all for anyone avoiding certain terms or phrases for the sake of avoiding harmful words but what about language policing? Many SJWs will take it one step further and demand that not only they selfcensor but that everyone else does as well. Like you said when someone says Thats so gay they rarely mean gay within the concept of disparaging homosexuals but rather using it as slang for lame or stupid. I dont feel that its anyones right to stop me from saying phrases like that. Extending on that I feel that it is within anyones right to be racist or sexist as long as it is just within their words. I know at least one homophobe and he has said some pretty despicable things. I may tell him Hey man. Thats really not cool but I would never dream of actively stopping him from saying those things.This is where I seem to depart from a lot of SJW rhetoric. I have seen many examples of SJW groups actively censoring groups through acts such as pulling fire alarms at MRA seminars and throwing homemade tear gas grenades in crowds at NSBM concerts. While I disagree with what these groups are saying I find the act of silencing these groups to be abhorrent.,ENFP,d5s8ky7,6,t5_2r4yi

So personally I dont think finding that life has no point is necessarily the course to take. It can be if that helps I guess. I just think it is one choice  it feels more like a rejection or a disillusionment with the purpose we have been provided or finding that the one we thought was there is empty or even acknowledging that we hadnt searched for one and oops now its kind of important. I feel like nihilism is a nuclear option to clear foundations for making discovering ones own purpose. The depression was me finding nothing. I eventually did and continue to do so. There are some things she can try to mitigate it as it takes its course Exercise keeps the body busy and releases endorphins. Keep the mind busy with tasks maybe volunteering if they have the time. I found this helped me socially kept me busy and helped me develop new skills as well as knowing I was helping.Live day to day.As for you Id suggest not getting too involved. Although by the sounds of it youve been through it and cant really fall into the same hole again I hope. I guess be yourself and be supportive but dont let her use you like a crutch. I mention those because they were really a problem for me when I was going through it. My friend and I both went through it at the same time and we sort of used each other as emotional crutches.... Not sure it relevant but whatever.At the end I found that two things were important to meWherever I go make an impact  preferably one that leads to good things.Add value to others. Hope some of this is helpful. ,ENFP,d69oess,7,t5_2r4yi

8831966,0,t1_d79ayhm,Id say I definitely felt somewhat underappreciated. My INFJ was in a bad place when we decided to break it off. She was in the process of deciding to move back to the city she briefly moved to for opportunities. She hates it where I live. Like I also dislike this place but I feel like she projected that onto our relationship. I dont know I felt miserable because she was and I felt like I was one of the last few tethers keeping her here. So we broke it off. It sucked but we had to.Shes there now. She seems a lot happier now. I see it in the photos she posts and the messages we send and the way she sounds over the phone. Its like what it was before she realized her home was elsewhere and I miss that SO MUCH.Would I ever consider opening up that relationship again? Honestly I cant give you a definite answer. We closed it for a reason but whenever we talk it feels as if a sliver of hope comes back. Im probably headed to that city at one point or another because thats where I want to live and do my graduate studies at not for her tbh but for me but itll be awhile and honestly Id be shocked if she wasnt a hot commodity or taken by that time. Should we find ourselves together single and willing mutually then why not? If not its perfectly fine. I just hope shes happy.

We connect really well and I think we have the ability to speak honestly with each other.I think us ENFPs can really open them up and break them out of their shell and shake em up a bit. I love that my INFP will just let me go on and on about whatever weird thoughts are going on in my brain and then he will start rambling but in a slightly different way and way quieter. I find that INFPs have a harder time understanding different values and perspectives so you might need to explain your needsvaluesperspective in a way that will resonate.Also they need SO MUCH ALONE TIME. MY GOD. its taken me months to finally feel secure and not always spiral whenever my infp needs to be alone for days. after a conflict even the smallest things sometimes they need to reflect and recharge for so long. I find open and honest communication to be super key. Trying to understand their values. It really can be quite magical though.

But before I make any assumptions do you have times when she hangs out with you AND your friends? If not she might feel left out like shes only relegated to that part of your life and not allowed to see the rest of it. She probably wants to know your friends. Have you taken her to see exciting things that you like to do? If not maybe she wants that. If youve done those things and she just wants everything you do to be with her that does not sound healthy. She needs to understand that she is not the only important person in your life and sometimes you need to spend time with you friends privately because thats a different relationship. Also and Im guessing if you mentioned this to her she might get upset about it so dont you probably dont want your friends holding back or acting different because theyre uncomfortable with your girlfriend around and if that happens enough theyll just feel separated from you like she has your life.

Ive been where you are Im so sorry that youve been through all this heartbreak recently.Im going to give you some advice and if you want some extra context then let me know and Ill share more.The heart of an enfp is super special. When we connect with someone we give all that we have. We start out in life as open books  there is no such thing to us as a connection that is not emotional in some way.Sooner or later we get hurt and our view of the world gets broken. Our looking glass isnt as clear and its more difficult for us to see things the way we used to. Take some time and dont date. If you can make yourself off limits as well as every possible romantic interest for at least six months. Take some time to breathe and repair your heart.

10390417,0,t1_dclt8py,Now do not misunderstand what I am saying.  I would not be suprised MBTI has a lot to do with what you are talking about.  Even if you were the same attachment quadrant like secure anxious avoidant anxious ambivalent or disorganized attachment whether you are ISFP ENFP ISTJ etc will influence some of the behaviors you do while stressed and what makes you feel more secure.  In addition I bet MBTI has a lot of things that deal with what mentally exhausts and energizes you in your environment during your daily life and what you consider drama stressful etc.But what I am saying is your fear of finality I think is a fear of control and not being able to establish some form of control if life throws a lot of curveballs at you.  People with the secure attachment due to life experiences are more open to this change and less scared of the finality of it all but people of the anxiousambivalent and the anxiousavoidant quadrants know through personal experience that when life throws your curveballs sometimes you get hit in the body and thus you find the finality of it all like you are giving up control and thus have less agency to control your situation in the future for it feels like you have no levers to change your reality.Am I making any sense to you?

10474431,0,t3_5psub9,Part of the type of meditation that is of the zen tradition called mindfulness and this is what most people in the US mean by meditate but there are different types of meditations...but part of mindfulness is not trying to think of nothing it is not trying to stop the runaway train.Instead it is to embrace the runaway train and then while watching it become a little detached.As a metaphor imagine you are at a citys subway terminal like New York.  You are going to sit on a bench and just people watch for hours.  You can see both the inside of the train but also the platform of the people getting on and off the train you can see the stairs  escalator that leads down to the platform and you can see the rest of the station.Mindfulness is just watching.  It is seeing the people come and go at the train  subway station.  It is not focusing on individual people you may focus on them momentary but you do not linger on purpose on specific people.And if you keep on doing it after a while your brain can enter a different type of state instead of a focused state you can enter a form of reflective state that is between focused and reflective that is mindfulness.  In this state when you watch people it is kinda like watching a time lapse video of a subway station.  You see the people but you also see them leave your brain does not linger on a specific thing but instead is in a state of tranquility but also observation.  In this timelapse that is going on your head you can see what is relatively stable and what is relatively constant but also patterns of movement like you see people coming and going but there are also things like rush hour and so on.ampnbspampnbspI can explain all of what is happening in brain networks and recent stuff we discovered with fMRI and other neuroimaging techniques roughly around since  we discovered previous things with fMRI far prior to that.Like this figure from Scientific American magazine that specializes in neuroscience called Scientific American MindLinks to a picture of the figureOr talking about brian networks such as this picture here from Powers  article was in nature neuroscience reviewsLinks to pretty pictureLinks to nd pretty pictureWell those last two pictures are about dynamic networks we use in the brain for different types of tasks and how we switch between them and all of those brain areas with the same color are correlated and used together as a team.  And we constantly pass information between these various networks and we change the intensity of each network depending on the task and when we do so we purposefully reduce the activity of certain networks while increasing the activity of other networks.  Aka like turning on and off lights in a room but instead of completely off or on we increase or decrease the intensity of certain brain regions.Well when you are not doing anything that requires external attention or focus we use a network called the default mode network which is one of the networks we use in mind wandering.  Now mind wandering is just one of a dozen things we use the default mode network for we use it also for empathy processing  understanding ones emotions autobiographical memory recall using the minds eye to imagine social comprehension and interaction moral reference and dozens of tasks that are self referential like figuring out what is the connection of you with something else in the present but also in the past and future and what are the connections between you and it. Almost all tasks where you turn your attention onto yourself and away from the environment use the default mode network in some way not just mind wandering.But when we focus when we turn our attention to the external environment and we try to filter out information we use a collection of different networks often called the task positive network and it includes  different networks the cognitive control network  fronto parietal network the cingulo opercular network and the dorsal attention network.  You do not need to know what these  networks do they are just related to focus attention and solving problems and getting stuff done.Well these task positive network as a whole is anticorrelated with the default mode network.  If we are super engaged with the default mode network we have to diminish the task positive network and if we are super focused we can only use the default mode network somewhat.  And then there are states in between where we use the default mode network with the task positive network in a roughly equal fashion and when we do so we often can think outside the box in the most creative way.  Switching between these networks is important for depending on the situation the environment but also the task we need to swap the intensity of these networks.Note many other networks I did not mention.ampnbspWell mindfulness is a way of doing this it is a technique where you purposefully engage the default mode network the task positive network and a rd network called the emotional salience network in a specific order.  You let your mind wander but you also use your task positive network to not over linger with your thoughts and follow thought trails you instead acknowledge the thoughts and let your mind keep wandering you also do not not focus on a specific thing in particular but instead on yourself and your breathing spreading your focus outward but also inward.  You feel emotions you experience but you do not over linger on the emotions for you acknowledge them and then bring your attention back onto yourself and your environment.And via doing mindfulness you are able to enter a state of tranquility that is restorative to your mind and is relaxing.  It does completely cause some changes in your brain minor stuff but still real effects stuff that can help with anxiety chronic pain empathy emotional control relationship counseling etc.  For by recentering yourself you help the brain see both the short and long term and not get over invested in things if doing so is not productive it helps you see the big picture but also the little details at the same time.,ENFP,dcvdvkf,3,t5_2r4yi

For texts I always mean to reply but sometimes right when I get it isnt a good time for me to type things and then Ill forget . Normally.. within  minutes I would reply. But then there are times when I wont reply until the next halfday phone having been dead at midday due to not charging or putting it on a charger and forgetting about it.. I guess I havent had many shit texting conversations but the one thing I can think of is when someone ignores me not because they are busy or whatever but just because they dont care to give me a response. Depends on the nature of the message. If its unimportant Ill assume they will either respond or they wont and Ill just let it be.  If its something I would like to do or get together or something I may check in again later. How long depends on how soon I need an answer to include them. I may even call if its something I need to know right then.. Ill probably respond right back unless Im busy in which case I try to respond every couple minutes.offtopic Dont kill me is crossed out?

10864293,0,t3_5vaeuu,Pfoe that seems like a lot but you sure sound determined to make something out of it. That determination is good and us ENFPs seem to be really broad people. My best advice is get someone as a friendcoachpartner that allows you to channel that into the right directions. We are highly individual people and always want to do things on our own but thats a downfall. Our projects never see the light of day if we do em alone. Seems like you have plenty of ideas to go around and all of them could be a fullfledged living but without some to actually make you do it it wont happen.I dont know what type is perfectly suited for this kind of relationship. I see that you have a lot of friends so maybe in that pool there is one that can help you stick this through. I know that with your strength as an ENFP you can convince them to help you stick to a goal. You do all the work and they just keep you in check I Dont mean micromanage you but you know that nudge when you get off the road.Some assumptions here Maybe because you are sick and have this feeling that long term goals might be out of the picture? Id say have a longterm goal regardless. It feels amazing working towards something that you are passionate about so forget about your disease and live towards it.

11120731,0,t1_desbo6c,What he says is actually quite true. But there is a key part I would add to appease both sides there has to be a certain tact and procedure for you speaking up or disputing someone. As an ENFP you need to take a step back and become more objective and evaluate many factors. Whichever ones you know are right we usually always know those quite easily and just be GRACEFUL in how you handle those situations. Some relationships and interactions are indeed toxic but if we are not careful we can go out and vilify everybody because we see the same traits or viewpoints in SO many people. Even strangers.You have to be able to constantly evaluate your words and also the context and content of others . Dont always  read so much into them.If not youll be a loudmouth mess of a person with no connections to people and be quite lonely. Justifiably so sometimes because we can be VERY confrontational when we perceive certain slights at our core values. Or repeated behavior patterns from our stronger relationships. Dont shit on everyone. But dont  ignore or overlook those really toxic folks for too long  they will eventually end up with more power over you than you realize  and its hard to cope with that. It can make us borderline insane if we dont have the ability to walk away when a certain overlook threshold has been met. Its so different from person to person and all the offenses of others carry different weight. Youll have to decide case by case. But we love thinking things out so it can be very fun but in a way too.

They are worlds onto themselves they are not superior or inferior to these traditional people the oIrganizing factors are just different.In physics there is something called the standard model where the interaction of all particles in the universe can be boiled down to  different types of forces providing push and pull attraction and repulsion but also things like spiral movements where things revolve around each other.  Those  forces are gravity electromagnetic like protons and electrons and the strong and weak force stuff that work to make smaller particles than a proton and electron be contained in one particleSome people theorized that there must be a th force out there or that the four forces are just modified versions of a singular unifying force grand unifying theory has a good intro to help compare the standard model with this alternate theoryI do not claim to really know the ideas and math and stuff about these theories I am pretty much Rob Lowe in this scene from the west wing probably one of my favorite top  scenes about the west wing if I were to limit favorite scenes to a few minutes of silliness and not specific episodes. minutes of awesomeness,ENFP,df31njw,3,t5_2r4yi
