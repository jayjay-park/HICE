I understand that fans of cult bands like Ween are passionate but you sound like idiots yelling out songs that they play almost every song.  Ive seen Ween somewhere between  times and they always play You Fucked Up for example.  Just enjoy yourself and quit yelling out songs!  As Ive heard Gener say many times were going to play our songs people.  Another good reminder is to shut the hell up when your close to the taping section!  Please!  ,ween,cxhjc9y,3,t5_2rqbl

I had barely heard them at all at that point but it was a hilarious show that put me on the Ween path. Saw them a few times after that when they would stop by Chicago. Honestly the best shows Ive seen of them were both solo shows last year really small spaces so it was cool to be right up by the music. Gene Ween in Evanston tore it up absolutely dead on and loud as hell I thought it was just going to be a quiet acoustic type set but he had a backing band that roared. And Deaner on New Years at just a small bar uptown playing mind melting guitar with the Brownouts. Didnt make it to the reunion shows but watching tons of videos.,ween,d02rfrx,2,t5_2rqbl
