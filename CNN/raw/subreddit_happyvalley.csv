7071123,0,t1_d1hv0k1,The opening scene wasnt really all that random it introduced Alison and Daryl into the story. Also he wasnt naming exclusively aggressive dog breeds and most of the aggressive breeds he mentioned have a bad reputation due to their use then any actual innate maliciousness.I dont really think there are supposed to be parralles drawn between Daryl and Ryan either beyond the fact that Catherine is worried about the role genetics play in people who commit serial murder. Daryl was the product of incest whose father is never said to have any kind of violent proclivities. Ryan is a normal child whose father is a sociopath. I dont disagree the ending was trying to convey some kind of message but frankly I didnt think it was all that well done. I would much have preferred if the last shot was of Ryans letter being read. ,happyvalley,d1hvibp,1,t5_2uuit
