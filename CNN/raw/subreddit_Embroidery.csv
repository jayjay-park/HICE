212518,0,t3_1w50cv,I havent participated in anything like this but it sounded interesting when I read your post so I googled my area small town Canada. Theres an embroidery association that meets once a month in a large city nearby...Ive been considering going to a meeting just to see because the website thats set up isnt very infortmative.

266135,0,t3_1x4090,I spent several years when I was younger working as a cashier in a very small grocery store. The owner didnt mind us reading a book or doing a crossword puzzle or something else small with our hands to keep ourselves occupied when we werent busy. We were required to stay at the registers. Id always have some small hand sewing or embroidery I was working on. I worked with a much older woman who didnt have any children to pass things on to and her mother had recently died. She had inherited a lot of unfinished embroidery work and didnt know what to do with it. She asked if I wanted it and I gladly took ALL of it. I used the vintage pieces and cut and inlaid them into other sewing things. I have a blouse now with cuffs and collar with her mothers embroidery on it. It brought tears to her eyes to see that old stuff she thought nobody wanted used and seeing the light of day. She was so happy and proud. My public embroidery also got me a job when a local costume designer saw me working and admired it. I spent some happy time working for one of the largest costumers in the country. Public sewing sure does get you noticed! And I only have good memories and stories of it! ,Embroidery,cf8cf9b,11,t5_2rh53
721061,0,t1_cgm1f1h,gt  if you look between the three triangles there is a thread where the needledesign jumped to fill another part of the pattern. If I were to snip that piece off would it significantly jeopardize the strength of the embroidery? I need to work on how to get that not to happen in the designs that Im digitizing but I would like to know just for my own knowledge.No youre supposed to snip those. Get or use some thin sharp scissors. To my knowledge there is not way to avoid these unless you completely stop your embroiderer and start again in the new position with a new piece of tread. Your stitch is secure.gt  should I be tying off the threads at the start and finish of the design? My machine doesnt leave me with enough thread to be able to tie with my thick fingers but I want to make sure that the piece wont start unravelling.Nope  Your embroidery is secure as long as you dont go pulling on things to break the stitch. No need to tie threads off. Side note huge Zelda fan! I love it! How do you like Stitch Era Universal? I use AutoPunch for my Singer Futura and I have to admit for as much as it cost Im not very happy with it. I cant seem to digitize anything and make it look anywhere close to what the original design was supposed to be.,Embroidery,cgm8kqa,1,t5_2rh53

2606599,0,t1_cmym6a5,Yep put a satin stitch around the edge. My technique for perfect patches is to apply FrayCheck to the satin border allow it to dry then use an Xacto blade to cut the patch out of the surrounding fabric all without unhooping. Go slowly with cutting it takes a bit of practice and youre bound to clip a few border threads. Once your patch is free take a lighter and go over the edges quickly. Be careful not to set anything on fire.,Embroidery,cmytj25,2,t5_2rh53

4246140,0,t3_39kpw9,The name of your company is difficult to read remember write. I embrace all cultures and can differentiate between them linguistically but even I had trouble with the name. You may need to simplify it for Westerners.Its unclear who your market is but from the photo of the young Western ladies wearing the clothes and the fact that you are internet and popup shopbased Im guessing your target is young Westerners with money? So ostensibly you are massmarketing traditional garb to the masses. It appears to be a stepup from Urban Outfitters but I find myself questioning the business. Convince me otherwise.From your siteTaita Leila aims to do two things.The first is to bring out the stories behind the embroidery. Traditional dress in Palestine was a language of thread. We research repackage and rework with this language decoding the meaning behind it to share with you.The second is to employ women who know how to embroider. We work with different villages and cooperatives to make designs that are wearable and that can be incorporated into a modern wardrobe. Granny chic is making a comeback.OK but conscious shoppers would want to know how the embroiderers are compensated. Do you give them percentages of sales or a flat rate when they produce the work? Whats your markup?Companies like these that purport to honor traditions ought to be scrutinized in order to make sure the craftsmen and women are not being taken advantage of i.e. sweatshops or poor compensation.The sentence We research repackage and rework with this language decoding the meaning behind it to share with you is gobbledygook. What are you really saying? That with each garment will be a note stating the background and meaning of the motifs? If thats the case you should just say that.Granny chic is making a comeback? Thats pretty insulting and obnoxious really. If youre trying to promote traditional crafts thats great. Granny chic is a pejorative term inspires visions of mothballinfused wool sweaters from an attic. Plus its an overused term.,Embroidery,cs4917d,6,t5_2rh53

4558652,0,t1_ct500ne,Its not the worst thing in the world but its best if you use the tools for what they are designed.  Both hair shears and sewing shears need to be very sharp.  Dull hair shears will damage hair and if youve ever met someone who sews youll know we get possessive about our shears.  About a month ago someone used my moms sewing shears to cut wire.  She didnt know so she went to cut fabric and it ended up a mess.  There were chunks taken out of the blade and they couldnt cut anymore.  If she had been cutting expensive fabric instead of plain cotton or if there was a limited amount of fabric then that could turn into an expensive project ruining mistake. No amount of sharpening could save them so she had to go out and buy new  shears.  Still better than the time my grandpa used her even nicer shears to cut roofing tile.Looking at pictures online it looks like hair shears have blunted tips which is good for not stabbing people when cutting hair.  Embroidery shears have pointed tips which are good for getting to the exact thread you want even if it inbetween others or held tight to the ground fabric.   Anyway moral of the story is try to have a dedicated pair if you can because they are designed for the job.  If you cant then use the next best thing and be aware of the limitations that it brings.,Embroidery,ct58iv0,2,t5_2rh53

If its really old that it breaks easily you might want to start with new thread instead.    Please note that most of the posts in this sub use embroidery threads so if youre using knitting yarn youll get a different effect more fuzzy.
