3043368,0,t3_2v0nto,Aside from buying the domain awesomesite.com and pointing an A record at a public IP on the Fortigate you will need to configure a Virtual IP VIP on the Fortigate and a policy permitting the traffic. If your ISP is giving you multiple IPs you can set up a  VIP matching the public IP to the internal one. If you only have one you can do a portforward VIP for port . In either case set the interface on the VIP to the Internet facing interface. Then create a policy permitting outside any to the VIP port . ,fortinet,codg08v,2,t5_2w4qs

5120278,0,t1_cv36fsy,Assuming you rebooted the box?  Yes we did.Assuming mem usage looks good? Memory usage looks fine. CPU usage during speedtest fluctuates between  and .Have you checked live cpu usage while doing a speedtest? Well check into doing that. Do you have any internal vlans or devices off different ports? We dont have any of those. We did try the file copy and everything seemed ok. Sorry about my bad terminology re modem. Ive just put up this post where we bypassed the Fortigate with a Huawei HG fibre box our ISP provided us and we got speeds of bms up and down so the fault seems to be squarely with our Fortigate settings. Thanks for your help. ,fortinet,cv36p7m,1,t5_2w4qs
5129325,0,t1_cv31c9f,UPDATE ON FORTIGATE D ISSUE Our ISP have changed a setting on their end and now we are getting blazing fast connection speeds again.

7019911,0,t3_4biy12,Found a reason not to do it this way. If you need VIPs that are bound to any interface the interface with the lowest ID will respond to ARPs for it which may not be the interface you want to receive traffic on for it.,fortinet,d1c224i,1,t5_2w4qs

7943005,0,t3_4o1xw6, Did you try registering the serial number of the device? It may be bundled with a year of support and Fortiguard services which would allow you to download the latest firmware. Alternatively you can msg me the serial and I can check for you Im a Fortinet partner. Also that pricing seems a bit high for the  yr. x Forticare. The D is a nice price point for learning or for home use. Of course any fullfledged UTMNGFW is generally overkill for your average consumer connection but use what best fits you.  is a good place to start as well as the Fortinet KB  ,fortinet,d48v940,4,t5_2w4qs

9896070,0,t1_dawyk1o,As mentioned you should definitely take a look at the kernel table.Use grep so we can narrow it down to what we care about for this issue which is ssl.root routes. Example    areyousmokingyet  get router info kernel | grep ssl.root    tab vf scope type proto prio ......gt... pref... gwy... devssl.root    tab vf scope type proto prio ......gt... pref... gwy... devssl.root    tab vf scope type proto prio ......gt... pref... gwy... devssl.rootssl.root or whatever VDOM routes will always be injected into the kernel table depending on what the SSL VPN client range is.In this case the range is ....... FOS breaks this into subnets which you see above.Therefore you can have routing issues such as what you are seeing if the SSL VPN client range is misconfigured. The client range should not overlap with any other subnet in the network.Note you will not see the routes when the ssl.root interface is set down of course. If on . at least .. reenabling the interface will not automatically inject the routes back into the kernel table. One must hit Apply again on the SSL VPN Portal page. I dont think this is expected behaviour but Im not looking into it right now.  ,fortinet,daxhcl4,1,t5_2w4qs

10718697,0,t1_ddjgej4,Nothing seemed to work so.  We ended up dedicating a spare FG as a VPN Concentrator.  After seeing your post I wanted to try disabling LDAPsTLS and see if that resolved the problem we kept the config on the original FG we just changed the IP.  Before I turned off LDAPs and TLS on the nonworking FG I tested issued diag test authserver ldap My Server MyUsername MyPassword and it worked fine???  So apparently changing the interface IP did the trick.  Weird.  ,fortinet,ddljyk6,1,t5_2w4qs
10719012,0,t3_5tasnm,In defense of EMS its a decent centralized endpoint management tool within the Fortinet ecosystem You can allocate specific FortiClient profiles per OUs patch vulnerabilities accordingly and make use of locational fortigate telemetry good for locational VPN overview of all endpoint. On the downside  really lame rollout to consumer base no real patchingvulnerability reporting features on your domain lacks granular overview documentation could be better only works with . and up may need fact check ok that needs FC autopush to both windows and Mac. ,fortinet,ddll4oy,1,t5_2w4qs

Also note that the C Generation isnt compatible with FortiOS . or later as the model is End of Sale.Might be worth exploring a Trade Up to the D Generation.
