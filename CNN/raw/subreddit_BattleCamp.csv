8046300,0,t3_4pf6is,What ive learned is to save gold up for lucky spins. These are the ones that pop up randomly after a fight. The best time to do it is during the Dominion and Battle Royale events. These are the most sought after monsters. Make sure you are trading on Bcrank. That way you can trade if you dont get the sign you want. Hope this helps.,BattleCamp,d4khasa,2,t5_2xtap
