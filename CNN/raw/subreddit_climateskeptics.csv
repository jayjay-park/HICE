226774,0,t1_cf47lv5,gtI think that they were also primarily the salt water kind of swimming pools buoyancy and germ protection funny how we go full cycle on so many things.Well yes and yet no theyre not really the same thing.  Some of the older pools that were near oceans like this cover LA beach area pool were technically salt water pools as in ocean watersalt water yes. BTW this is still apparently common with cruise ships and swimming pools in places like the Caribbean  they drain amp refill frequently even daily. But in terms of the modern entity known as a salt water pool a fresh water pool that has had salt  sodium chloride  dissolved in it and with an ionization based chlorine regenerator operating on the filtrationrecirculation system... well no its really NOT the same thing as the ocean at all.See the latter has  hopefully around  ppm  of free chlorine in it technically its not chlorine in the water but rather its broken up via the ionizer into hypochlorous acid and a hypochlorite ion along with cyanuric acid aka stabilizer to reduce sunlightUV burnoff of the former along with algaecides etc  that functions as an active disinfectant to rapidly kill bacteria and other nasty microbes. Note the idea that a salt water pool has no chlorine in it is just marketing nonsense the chlorine is there and operates in the same way that a pool using liquidsolid chlorine does  and you WANT it to be there  the only difference is the source.The former  ocean water  does not really have the substantial levels of hypochlorous acid amp hypochlorite ions that you wantneed i.e. no disinfectant at all the ocean itself has other means of dispersing bacteria mainly intermixing and sheer volume  and if the volume doesnt mix it up properly as sometimes happens at certain beaches  then the water becomes just one big petri dish. Plus the salt levels of actual seawater are like x higher than what you have in a modern salt water pool.So... personally  knowing what I know about how various microbes can spread and propagate in water that has inadequate chlorination and moreover that has had probably dozens if not hundreds of people in it  I wouldnt swim in an ocean water pool unless I knew it had just been completely drained amp refilled and I was the first and only one to swim in it.I also refuse to swim in any public pool or probably even a private backyard pool though the risk there is lower just because of fewer people that I havent personally tested for proper pH and chlorine levels with my own test kit thank you very much.Also as a side note while the salt water i.e. ionized chlorine systems are probably perfectly fine for private residential lowbatherload swimming pools provided you dont have a HUGE pool party  I remain skeptical about their ability to maintain a CONSTANT gt  ppm free chlorine level in public varyinghighbatherload swimming pool environments. Im sure if the pool has a large enough volume AND the ionization system is properlyadequately sized i.e. significantly oversized to meet peak possible demand that it is possible... But the systems that I have seen installed dont seem up to the task i.e. an inadequate ionizer cannotwill not keep up with a rapid depletion of chlorine that can occur in many pools  when in a matter of minutes the number of people in the pool goes from ZERO to  all of them essentially sweaty and unwashed... plus each slathered with  bottle or more of unabsorbed sunscreen... not to mention the volume of makeup deodorant perfumes hair product etc  Ive seen the records from some of those systems and know the math involved and alas but the chlorine PPM can and does easily drop from  down to essentially ZERO in probably  to  minutes not to mention the pH change  given enough time  the ionizers may be able to get it back to  PPM... but in the meantime everyone is swimming in what is essentially zerodisinfectant water i.e. may as well be communal bath water  otherwise known as a community gastrointestinal party or if you want to be really crude the equivalent of a neighborhood rimjob orgy .The only systems that can adequately respond to that kind of massmobilechemobiological cesspool  and that FAST of a drop in free chlorine  are fullyautomated computerizedORPPPMtesting with variabletoHIGHvolume liquidchlorine dispensers and obviously with automatic pH compensation as well. The area I am from there iswas a particularly NASTY waterborne gastrointestinal bug protozoan  called Cryptosporidium  thing is darned difficult to kill off and you absolutely DONT want to contract it nor do you want it anywhere near your pool. While I admit to just generally being more anal rententive so to speak than most averagenormal people  in this case the cause of ME having the awarenessprofessional test kit is that I have been in charge of our communitys semipublic swimming pool for nearly a decade now and having perforce needed to upgrade my prior private pool experience to a higher level and acquire the skillsknowledge of a certified pro to bring the facility back into good condition... well Ive become increasingly known in our local area as the guy to call for problem pools  public and private  unfortunately I normally only get called in after other idiots and have pole will vacuum jerks have totally FUBARd the water chemistry can you say putrid swamp? with all kinds of expensive but worthless garbage and worse when its some emergency just a few days prior to some big event  normally the solution is the equivalent of the Nuke it from orbit but sometimes its faster to drain and start from fresh  hours to crystal clear amp safe.,climateskeptics,cf493hh,3,t5_2qk5q

A lot of water build up can occur on top of permafrost ground because the water cannot be absorbed by the frozen ground underneath. When this occurs roots that are close to the surface can be warped or the soil that holds up the tree can oversaturate and shift causing the plant to lose its bearings and slightly tip in one direction. Forests affected like this are called drunken forests because of the wobbly crooked appearance of the trees. SourceIOW it is not simply as the NatGeo article implies that the ground is warming or that permafrost is thawingmelting that causes the phenom  in can and is caused by various coolingfreezing cycles as well.

All types of power generation needs to be shut down for maintenance so theyre all intermittent. There is also variable demand because you have some big flexibility obstacles for turning power plants on and off this means letting generation run full blast and dumping the spare energy and then having another set of smaller power stations that you turn on only in the few days of the year that you expect the very highest power consumption which then stay off the rest of the year. Its spectacularly wasteful.The root of all of this is that by having energy capacity we can smooth out these peaks and jitters to be able to take advantage of this spinning reserve.

About  is radiated off as heat meaning we collectively emit about  trillion calories or about  trillion  x  joules per day. In comparison solar heating provides about  x  joules per day.

I am not sure we have instruments sensitive enough to measure heat input on that order. But that is all irrelevant because any energy emitted by humans is energy that is in the system.

Its perfectly capable of paying for itself if the rapid advance of the market gives the host country a dominant position in the newly created world market.I havent done a survey but I bet theres countless examples of past subsidies that have had an overall positive impact.I know you wont agree with this one but look at the market for electric cars  theyd still be a cute curiosity for the rich while battery tech improved if it werent for the heavy tax credits that went along with them. Instead Nissan has shipped over  Leaf sedans and Tesla has sufficient business for them to warrant building a new battery factory. The battery factory will then lower prices and a subsidy will no longer be critical to market success. The subsidy just jump starts selected industries when the cost seems worthwhile.In a few years if Tesla does as well with their lower prices vehicle as I think they will they may pay enough back to the US government in taxes to literally recoup all the money lost from tax credits.Were big on business in the US. I dont see why everyone is so weird about the US running itself like a business. And the US gets paid from markets so it can make sense to invest in market development.It definitely should never be the only way we expect markets to advance but to say it actually doesnt work seems to conflict with the economics of the situation.Ive heard plenty of people say subsidies cant work but thats an easier claim to make than it is to prove.,climateskeptics,cjxavsy,0,t5_2qk5q

How do you respond to that when they refuse to even use language correctly? Yeah words have multiple meanings but to claim they can mean whatever you want them too...I know its difficult to wrap your head around but there are a large number of people  significantly increasing in fact  who really DO hold this view in some fashion or another.At its root I think it is based in two things . the increasing distance of people from the realnatural world  lets face it especially in the western first world nations most people live their entire lives in an essentially if not wholly artificial environment true even before the advent of things like recent virtual reality video games but that of course has heightened the disconnect  a world where just about everything around them DOES in fact seem to be a matter or rather arbitrary choiceconfiguration and where cause amp effect are often hard to discern or where peoples experience of it is highly distorted via education media etc.. the educational system and the fact that most peoples learning is at a generally VERY superficial level  they learn the jargon the words but never really gain a full understanding of underlying concepts or worse gain an understanding but one that is fundamentally flawed distorted and erroneous this is especially problematic when you toss in things like relativity and social construct where the instructor is often themselves only vaguely familiar with the jargon and so teachesresponds to questions with a pretentiously distorted obfuscatory hodgepodge the primary point of which is to avoid people discovering that they the teachers are in fact clueless mediocrities  basically since they cannot dazzle with brilliance they baffle with bullshit... And weve had several generations of the above two now and at all levels in increasing degrees forgive the pun so the amount of distortion amp disconnect  even a sort of reversion to a type of primitivism albeit an urbanaffluentprimitivism that does NOT comprehend the workings of the things it is surrounded by i.e. just about everything is a black box that just mysteriously seems to work at least until it doesnt amp then it gets thrown out and replaced  or else repairedfixed by someone else... thus among other things we see a return to various types of mysticism and even animalistic behavior patterns i.e. breakdown of family structure inability to control impulsiveirresponsible behaviors even the acceptance and indeed endorsement of widespread hedonistic activities etc.If you want to dig in a bit further  and have the stomach to see just how far modern academia has dug that rabbit hole of inanity  Id highly recommend Alan Sokals book Fashionable Nonsense. The thing is that there IS a kernal of truth in those things. Words ARE social constructs and technically speaking couldcan have been defined to mean something entirely different and of course many things ARE definedexperienced only in a relative fashion. The problem is when people add in things like only  i.e. that words are only social constructs rather than names for abstract concepts and things that objectively exist and indeed preexisted being named or that everything is relative and then use that as an excuse to fall into solipsism and nihilism. One seemingly ironic aspect of this is that IMHO anyway it makes things like the Biblical story of Genesis to be far more profound than many give it credit for to wit the story notes that the animals were brought before Adam to see what he would name them... IOW they obviously preexisted his naming and the name was just a label which has importance and value in social  that is human interaction  contexts but that also means it is neither magical mysterious and while arbitrary is not willy nilly.,climateskeptics,cqh5f6n,6,t5_2qk5q

3927092,0,t1_cr3w8ti,gtWhenever it wasis my point is that that kind of climate change moves slowly whereas Antarctic ice loss in terms of volume is relatively very rapid.Ah but heres the crux of the problem.  We dont know how long ice loss from West Antarctica has been going on at the present rate plus or minus of course.  Weve only had instrumentation to measure it for a couple of decades and instrumentation to measure it well for less than a decade.  Its possible that ice loss has been going on for the last several thousand years.  Its also possible that it happened to start as soon as we started measuring it.  The latter would be a remarkable coincidence.gtIn other words yes volcanoes are playing a significant role in some regions of the WAIS but it would be an unlikely coincidence if they were the primary cause at exactly the time many climate scientists are expecting melting from warming mean temperatures.If its primarily from an increase in mean surface or near surface temperatures why is it not melting on the east side?  Why is sea ice increasing?  We have temperature measurements from around the melt area.  Why are they not above C?Personally I think there is likely some anthropogenic link to some of the Antarctic glacial melt but given all that we dont know and given that we do know that volcanoes are hot it makes even ballpark attribution very difficult.  I think we are very much in agreement that anyone saying that volcanoes have no effect has an agenda and I would go so far as to say that anyone saying that mankind has no effect on these glaciers also has an agenda.,climateskeptics,cr3x9z9,2,t5_2qk5q

5632250,0,t1_cwslhfb,gt this is a perfect example of the greenhouse affect. Because greenhouse gases such as CO have a higher spectra than nitrogen oxygen and carbon when the plant absorbs it the extra energy is then used to promote cell growth if you give it more energy it grows faster.Thats not how CO helps plants to grow faster. Its not more energy to the plant its literally gas converted to food for the plant.  Greenhouses work to produce extra warmth in sunshine because of two properties they greatly reduce convection that would normally carry away heat and the glass lets in ultraviolet rays but blocks the transmission of IR.  The convection is by far the more powerful of the two ways that greenhouses produce heat.But and this is important when plants are fed more CO without extra IR energy supplied they grow better.  The idea that more it is an increase in IR in certain frequencies that help plants to grow better is absurd.

6076675,0,t1_cyg16es,gtto convincingly show that warmism science is wrong youd have to show that its wrong using science itself. Yes and the way science is shown to be right is to have predictive power.  The current science does not.  gtand the accuracy of the models is expected to improve Yes and when it improves it will have to come in line with what we actually see happening.  Currently the observations that have been made all are found near the bottom of the predicted range.  The range is very large and all of the actions that are being demanded are based on the idea that the very top of the predicted range would warrant such actions.  Im perfectly willing to discuss actions required by the predictions once the middle of the predictions matches the observations.  This would require lowering the predictions substantially.  If the size of the predicted range did not change then lowering the midpoint to match observations would cause the lower range to actually be negative.  Which basically means that the range is too large or science has no idea whether it will actually warm or cool.  gt To convincingly show that a huge amount of money has been wasted youd have to show that the amount of money is huge and that it was wasted.Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent in the name of Climate Change activism.  If those dollars had been spent on growing food millions of people would eat better.  I consider that a better use of the money.  Currently were spending a lot of money forcing fuel companies to incorporate ethanol into our gasoline even though science has shown that the ethanol produces less energy than the gasoline reducing milespergallon and the production of the ethanol produces more CO in the long run than the equivalent gasoline would have.  Its a huge expensive counterproductive waste of time and money.There are other examples.  Im not against renewable energy sources and Im a huge promoter of research into things like better batteries and electric vehicles LED lights more efficient air conditioning etc.  I believe in maximizing our utilization of existing energy because doing so frees up money that can be used for other things.  But the push that were doing to convert systems away from efficient designs to more costly designs in the vain hope of reducing our future temperature by a few hundredths of a degree is robbing our current engineering talents that could be used to create great things.,climateskeptics,cyg4xu8,6,t5_2qk5q

6358609,1,t1_czcdj4h,Ok  I understand You are essentially quoting from this book Except Snook got the physics wrong.  Earth isnt a plate with  of its area facing the sun.    of the photons from the sun do not get absorbed by the earth.  The difference in solar energy related to the ice age are postulated as partly due to changes the orbital parameters of the sun around the earth that have happened over tens to hundreds of thousands of years Thats not over  months.  Aside Changes in eccentricity means that the entire orbit would change not just that it might be orbiting at a perihelion distance vs aphelion distance The . difference in surface areas of spheres at perihelion vs aphelion is at the extreme which is only for  day  a months effect at best. The sun isnt a point source energy source. The earth isnt an infinitely small point. The space between the earth and sun is filled with plasma and the distance is a simplification of roughly the center of mass of the earth to center of mass of the sun inside the actual sun and not fixed. So you cant just say in regards to EM radiative distance that the earth is now exactly at this exact further distance based on apoperigees. This means the simplistic two spheres calculation is invalid.  Even if incident energysquarearea changes by x that doesnt mean you take the temperature of the object in K and multiply by x to get how much the temperature will shift. For example Take a black piece of paper and a white piece of paper from the shade to the sun. The black piece of paper will warm up much more than the white piece despite both having an identical increase in energysquarearea. Or do the same thing with the same color objects but at different initial temperatures. The cooler objects get warmer faster than the warmer objects despite both having an identical increase in energysquarearea.,climateskeptics,czceiyt,0,t5_2qk5q

6588650,1,t3_45wy90,gt Global warming alarmists like to tell us that we can all trust the global warming science  because  of all scientists  an overwhelming consensus  agree with the science.Um. No. Thats not how hard sciences actually work. The X consensus where people argue about how much Xgt is handwaving to try to get the nonscientific to understand how science becomes settled science. Science becomes settled when there exists a theory that agrees with the known and understood laws of math and physics to explain a physically observed phenomena and there is no better theory. So CO causes warming that we see warming that humans are the major drivers of that increase in CO e.g. AGW is settled science. This hoopla about  of scientists is really not I personally think a good way to get the general public to understand how science works. I think a better explanation was given by Feynman here If we know the physics we know the math  we have the observations we followed the scientific method with logical and rational conclusions and there is no better theory that makes good predictions then its essentially settled science. In regards to the eggs story  you wont get any argument from me that the Medical Establishment has a long way to go before they are close to migrating to evidencebasedmedicine away from their current model of eminencebasedmedicine. I think this is also a good contrast example of why the  evidence for AGW is there and an example of how the evidence for eggs butter etc being bad for you was not.Story time  I was talking to an old doc a few years ago about eggs and he said He knew about the early eggcholesterol study  or so years ago and noticed that the original paper was published by an agresearch school in Kansas which said yes eggs have cholesterol but also have cholesterolinhibitors ... so on the whole so eating eggs should be good But he said the study was funded by the cereal manufacturers so that second part was dropped when it made it to the medical and popular publications and so only the first part about eggs being high in cholesterol was kept.  I did a search for that old study  but he wasnt specific enough and it was a few years ago we were discussing it so Im afraid I have no other information.

In other words create as true to form as one can and see what happens. Hey thats a fair question too. They actually have been many experiments that measure how CO causes a rise in temps in the entire environment it is in. From the simple does CO absorb IR radiation? to simple greenhouse gas experiments to simple experiments you can run at home to extremely detailed measurements by professional scientists over  years Aside There is also this site but as far as I know theyve not done a test to alter CO levels in the biosphere or even if they can if its truly a completely sealed environment.  But TLDR there have been many precise experiments verifying the physics of CO and how when you alter CO in an environment it raises temperatures in the entire environment including the surfaces in it. ,climateskeptics,d021iv4,0,t5_2qk5q

Im not sure what I can do other than what Ive already done and have planned but not yet accomplished.  What have I done? Well I bought an electric car and Ive reduced my electric energy usage outside of charging the car by replacing incandescent lights with LEDs.  I put my thermostat on  to  during the summer and  during the winter.  I telecommute to work so that I dont have that terrible waste of gasoline driving in every day.  Its so much more earth friendly to telecommute and I dont waste  hours a day sitting in my car. I like that a lot better.Now I dont own an electric company so I cant shut down the coal burning power plants in my area.  But my electric provider tells me they are working on doing just that  replacing coal with cleaner natural gas and adding solar power.  Again thats not something that I have any control over so its not my behavior that is under discussion here.I have recently taken a job out of the country and will be relocating.  I plan to lease an apartment near enough to the office so that I can walk or ride a bicycle to work  I dont think telecommuting will be an option there.  Where I am moving to never gets colder than  nor hotter than  so I wont run a furnace or airconditioning at all.  Ill eat only fresh locally grown fruit and vegetables beans and rice supplementing with sustainably caught fish.  I plan to live in a small one room efficiency so a couple of low wattage LED lights will be the only power Ill need beyond the few watts that my Apple computer uses.  Ive got a feeling that Im not going to be the one causing the problems here.

9298709,0,t1_d8u35m8,gtWell Ill admit that I am not familiar with this doubling concept you describe. That is the input metric for both TCR and ECS. Each is based on a doubling of CO from some starting point. We generally use preindustrial levels of  ppm as the starting point but it neednt be that. We could use todays  ppm as a starting point if we so chose.gtBut it is pretty clear in AR... This seems much higher than you report.Again that is committed warming based on those levels. gtIncidentally this RCP. scenario is not at all implausible.Heres a great article that goes into the details of RCP . gtgtRCP. assumes a slowing of technological innovation most clearly seen in energy use. By  energy efficiency has improved only slightly reversing the current decadeslong trend so that despite GDP being onethird lower than under RCP. energy consumption is over twice as large. Worse we will have gone back to a th Clike future where the world in  is powered by coal. This is possible but not a business as usual scenario.gtcoal use worldwide is still rising in You sure about that?But more to the point RCP . calls for more coal than there are reservesgtgtIn the IPCCs businessasusual scenario Representative Concentration Pathway RCP . coal accounts for half of future carbondioxide emissions through  and twothirds of the emissions through . The IPCCs coal burn is enormous twice the world reserves by  and seven times reserves by .Its implausible when it relies on more economically extractable resources than actually exist.Also you havent accounted for the fact that RCP . assumes the very highest population projection from the UN.gtEven the  ppm case that you seem to take for granted will not be easy to achieve without strong policies. Consider this. We use the resources with the highest Energy Returned on Energy Invested ERoEI first. That means we initially forego the more expensive and poorer quality stuff by picking the proverbial lowest hanging fruit first. Once we use the cheapest and easiest resources we go back for the marginal resources. Does this sound like a selftaxing commodity? It is. Look at fracking. It takes prices north of maybe   bbl for fracked oil to break even. Probably around the same for tar sands. Deep water stuff is in the same neighborhood. Dont let the current low prices of oil fool you. We dont find gushers any more.Does that mean that we should adopt a laissez faire energy policy? Of course not. The present policy results in oil and other prices that whipsaw the economy. Demand slowly grows until it exceeds production gt prices spike gt capital flows into new production gt high prices result in recession gt investment in production halts. I think you would be surprised at the number of skeptics who have solar panels on their homes drive EVs and support RampD of advanced nuclear power.

11112724,0,t1_derhg93,gtHeres a source for a recent study that says the PT extinction was caused by an iceage and its certainly the opposite of what you say.That source is interesting and I admit I was not aware of it until now but I wouldnt say it automatically falsifies previous theories. It also goes to show that we are still learning about how global climate works and it is unwise proceed as we are without knowledge of the consequences.gtAre you saying the geological record from  million years ago has a time resolution of less than  years the timespan for our current .ppmvyear CO blip?No Im saying we know CO concentrations rose about  ppm during a time period anywhere from  years long. Assuming it was a  year long period of increase the average yearly increase would be .ppm. Obviously it wouldnt be a steady increase of . ppm for  years straight. gtWouldnt it be more reasonable to assume there were many thousands of shortterm CO spikes that have been smeared over time to a .ppmv value average? Comparing your millions of years long average to a  year average is sensationalizing something makes no point at all on closer examination.Yes and I do assume that I thought the word average made that clear. If you think thats an invalid way to put it why not just use a graph of CO from the past  years?gtCome on now havent we all had enough with these kind of wild predictions?I assure you I hate those popsci articles far more than you do.
