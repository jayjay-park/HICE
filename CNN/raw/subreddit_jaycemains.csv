6417086,0,t1_czhytop,I think Selfie got stormraiders surge in order for the tenacity against lissandra and same for clense. Selfie definately played the safer optiong going with the likes of Youmuus and manamune. Im sure he wanted to stack his tear quickly and wanted to save mana by autoing to proc the stacks. I definitely agree with you though. And im impressed how Selfie brought himself back into the game considering he got caught alot early.thanks for commenting on my post aswell. massive fan from OCE,jaycemains,czj23af,1,t5_37wcr
6509725,0,t1_czsmnbm,Thanks for the reply. That makes a lot of sense. Ive found that the way I do it is faster and for me more accurate I just didnt want to lose out on damage just in case,jaycemains,czsnlv6,1,t5_37wcr
6615784,0,t1_d03kudz,I dont see getting Duskblade before ghostblade ever really. I think ghostblade with  arpen and a good enough active is too good. Or maybe Im bad but I do like ghostblade active for an early tower. ,jaycemains,d03mmwh,2,t5_37wcr

But dont play like a bitch play smart and aim to do the most damage in the game.You will eventually find it easy to win games give it time.Im in bronze and its taken me a lot of poor streaks to finally actually win games. you got this.,jaycemains,d0cjlsg,1,t5_37wcr

7933758,0,t1_d47601a,If youre just talking about the old build with trinity reaver and IE then obviously tear was unnecessary. But in the older seasons before reaver I would get tear ghostblade and IE and that would be all the crit I needed. It would give  crit reduced to  some time later and that was all I needed. Youre only getting like  autos max anyways.  out of  crit is enough most of the time if youre lucky you get more. Not saying tear is necessary but you can still incorporate it into your build now that tf is garbage. I personally will go tear still because with the full build I can get a last whisper and a QSS. I will still hurt with poke later as well as have a Qss because getting within  range puts you in danger. IE Muramana LDR lucidity Merc Reaver is an ideal build nowadays if you want to get crit and not waste an item slot on unnecessary attack speed. ,jaycemains,d47tuvu,1,t5_37wcr

8072703,0,t1_d4muq67,partywnys right Attackspeed is totally wasted on Jayce.I do think  is quite low but you dont necesserily need to crit every time since you dont rely solely on AAs. If one of the three hyper charges crits its enough.,jaycemains,d4ng4xp,3,t5_37wcr
8096738,0,t3_4q42l5,thing is YGERLWIE handles lategame damage just fine too. sure manamune has a lot of AD and lets you spam to your hearts content but it comes in late in a meta thats very earlymidgame oriented and those g could have been  longswords and a pot for lane dominance.sure if you have a lane you can totally dominate by throwing an empowered shockblast every  seconds go for it but in most cases youre gimping yourself.its not that its not always been a gimp but there used to be time to catch it up it used to stack a lot better and it used to give you mana back  now it just gives the mana its always done but only stacks on spells unless you upgrade it to manamune which is also a waste and it gives you nothing else than mana unless youre spamming. Games used to drag out till you caught up but they dont anymore.,jaycemains,d4q59tv,2,t5_37wcr

9363101,0,t3_58qd1d,Git Gud.How can we tell you how to carry when we have no idea what youre doing wrong right or just ok?Generic advice is probably just I know that seeing as how you have k mastery. Do you Q then E instead of E Q? Do you regularly top your mana off with W in hammer form? What do you build? Do you not ward enough and get camped? Do you never gank another lane after you win yours? Do you force your team to get objectives by shotcallingpinging? Do you auto reset with your W? Do you just auto attack when someone is trying to juke your Q instead of firing your Q? There is so many things you need to ask yourself to climb and Jayce being a mechanical powerhouse means you have more questions than say a malphite. ,jaycemains,d92u993,3,t5_37wcr

9637632,0,t1_d9zqsub,Lategame IR and ER is everything you need for damage just like... ever its just that the buildpath gives you a slump for  gold worth of time once youve finished the ADcomponents and until you finish ER and get the extra cloak to set you on  crit.had a kindasomewhatdecent game here managed to do a good deal of damage considering i wasnt really ahead. Lategame while chasing me that vi ran into a hypercharge and just died was amazing then the rest of them caught me but she stopped being so cocky after that pERIELucidDD also offers a good buildpath outside of the critslump and caps your CDR ,jaycemains,da11c6p,1,t5_37wcr
9849599,0,t1_dar6ip8,Yeap its pretty core for my Jayce build top or mid. As for the build order its pretty situational but a few things I doRushing Executioners gt Usually build LW st or nd item.Core gt Rush Cleaver and IBG. Cleaver is just so damn stronk. I tend to be very aggressive early so this core allows me to all in more than I could normally if I just went straight AD. vs AP gt Usually rush Hexdrinker as I dont use MR runes or QSS for a heavy CC champ. Still experimenting with EoN. YGB is still a core for the MS active and then you got Deaths Dance Duskblade Bloodthirster for some other dmg situationals. For tankier its usually situational as well but common items might be GA warmogs visage dead mans banshees. ,jaycemains,darfc0d,1,t5_37wcr

10599839,0,t1_dd99f1v,I never said EU gt NA and im in d not d.But well since you did bring up that topic i shouldnt have to say that a larger playerbase means a more refined leaderboard. That being said its true that EU ranked ladder is more difficult to climb than NA when i looked you up earlier you were d with  points and i was d with  points. You were around the top  Players in NA i was  in EUW. Larger playerbase  More refined leaderboards especially at the top.I really hope you can see the logic in this incase you cantImagine EUW is a server with  people where a max. of  ppl can be challenger and out of those  people   players are actually Challenger Material. Now in NA it would be around  People which would mean that only  players are Challenger material. Now obviously since there arent enough challenger players to fill all  spots  master tier players who wouldnt normally be in challenger are in challenger because of a smaller playerbase. This ofcourse is the case for the lower ranks aswell Obviously this is a very extreme example but it should help you understand why bigger servers have more refined soloQ ladders. There are more people fighting for the top spots so the top spots are more valuable.So we are both D and im playing on EUW you can think of the rest.And having a higher rank doesnt make you a better player with a certain champ. Why do you think Bjergsen went to get help from Tobias about GP? Cause Tobias was the better league player? No because his GP is sick.I dont hate NA in the slightest and idk why you would think that since i never implied that EU gt NA in my post i just said I wish i was on NA so i wouldnt have to play with  ping when i wanna go up against other jayce players.anyway im done argueing really cant be bothered.

11135495,0,t1_detn2je,Jayces scaling is alright but you mainly run into problems with heavy AD comps. Lethality builds do not feel good when the whole enemy team is building armour. Its definitely important to control the game early though,jaycemains,deu74bt,1,t5_37wcr

11406552,0,t1_dfowuei,The thing bout essence reaver is that it gains value when you have other crit items. So first iteming it would be a complete waste. The recipe needs a BF sword if you can accomplish that then you should just build duskblade and snowball the game instead of wasting  gold on  crit way too unreliable. Then second item IE another .k gold dayummm you taking slow path here. There are  cheap crit items with higher crit itd be a total waste to not use them. Problem? Jayce his W... So we need to max E second here and its all good. PD gt ER gt IE sounds the most viable in my opinion. Statik shiv feels good for waveclear but is probably not worth it. ,jaycemains,dfox2u5,1,t5_37wcr
