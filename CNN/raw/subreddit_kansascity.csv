12201,0,t1_cefo3wz,Those of us who signed up early during the rallies under the idea that Google will come through and install once and never again got nothing but a long wait.  A lot of those people still dont have service. Then Google launched a holiday promotion ended Dec  where the johnnycomelatelys who somehow missed the massive amount of PR Google was doing during the initial signup were allowed to sign up AND get free goodies to hold them over until their install date. That tablet they got is also a lot nicer and newer than what the initial customers got. So in short I think its cool that they reopened signups but I feel they really gave the finger to the people who generated so much of the initial interest.That said I cant be too mad because the service itself is pretty awesome.  For those of you still waiting I promise you its worth it.  ,kansascity,ceftnq9,3,t5_2qngc

My roommates were from Winfield so they would go early to setup their tents and claim a spot.  Its very easy to get lost at night looking for your tent if youve been drinking.  Everyone was very laid back and nice.  Lots of people carrying around instruments for impromptu jam sessions.  Stage  is the small stage inside the camping area. You can buy camping only pass and not go into the main area but stage  is available is pretty much whoever wants to jam.  You can hear some incredible people up there and Tommy Emmanuel would always come out after his last set on the big stage and jam on stage  for the campers.  I cant wait unitl i can find the time to go back!,kansascity,cihkkl5,3,t5_2qngc

1337978,0,t1_cihrmb5,gt So are you advocating for a law that requires procreation to get married?No.gtWhat about someone who is sterile or otherwise cannot have kids?What about them?gt No marriage for them?That is their business not mine.gtAnd how is samesex marriage keeping heteros from having kids?I dont know if there is any impact.So what am I talking about? There is a question much more fundamental that serves as the foundation to the marriage debate. Is there such thing as truth and if there is from where does it come? I suspect most who advocate for legal recognition of same sex marriage come from the perspective that what is true about marriage comes from public consciousnesses. That is people hold it to be true and therefore it is true.I consider this philosophy to be false. I hold any truth to be an objective fact without regard to how others think or feel about it.Think of a rock. I type the word rock and a certain image comes to mind. Platonic philosophers would call this the form of rock the abstract rockness that anything must conform to to be a rock.The word rock serves as a goto referencing the actual real thing of a rock. But lets say that the government requires trees to be also included in that goto. So I say rock and maybe Im talking about what you previously imagined or perhaps a Maple Tree comes to mind. The goto changed but not the objective thing itself.Marriage is an agreement between persons for the exchange of acts fitting for procreation and the sharing of responsibility of any children that may be produced from such acts. Thus the concept of consummation of marriage. The word marriage is a goto for that state of living.It has become popular in this age to include relationships that in principle are nonprocreative as opposed to those who fail merely because of age disease or timing as marriage. When the government recognizes that as marriage they are telling a lie. They are saying those two relationships are the same. They are not. Furthermore they require those who must state the nature of a relationship clerks lawyers other professionals to themselves lie.I dont care what other people do but I resent being coerced by the government to state something to be that which it is not. I dont care if it is the government telling me that I have to state that a tree is a rock or that a sodometic relationship is marriage. I just want to be honest and when I say marriage I want it to be in reference to relationships where there was an agreement for the exchange of acts fitting for procreation.,kansascity,cik4ztj,0,t5_2qngc

1594385,0,t1_cjg002m,Its kind of a long story just to add to what ulabchimp had to say.  IHOP has more or less taken over Grandview and the portion of South Kansas City east of where this picture was taken Minor Park.They are an end times cult that believe the end of the world could literally happen at any moment.  They have conned people from all over the country to basically leave where they are at sell all their worldly possessions and make their way to the church who then gladly takes their money.The church puts them up in housing that it owns.  The church owns over  houses in Grandview alone I am told.  They pack people in  per house and do whatever it is they do pray mostly.The cultists are something of a nuisance I have several friends that live in Grandview that tell me stories about the crazy shit they do mostly causing problems due to the high density of people living together in a single house and violating building codes.The IHOP cult has essentially bought and paid for the city government in Grandview since they have brought so many people to that part of town theoretically increasing the tax base I guess.  The mayor of Grandview resigned a while back allegedly due to some shady stuff that went on between him and IHOP.Its a long fucked up story.  Im only scratching the surface.  I grew up in Grandview and still have friends there thats basically why I even know any of this.

This leaves your steel too brittle though so you then want to do a lowtemperature quench in a kiln or the like around F for two hours then aircool.

The heat pumps  elecrtrical heat are great for fall and spring weather but they would be far from ideal during winter from the perspective of both cost and comfort. With that said when we replaced two AC units dating from the s with two high efficiency heat pumps the difference in price between AC only outdoor unites and heat pumps was only a few hundred bucks after considering rebates and incentives. However we live in KCMO proper and some friends of ours who live in Leewood said the incentives were not near as good for them.I like our heat pumps but I would never install them in a house in the KC area without a complimentary natural gas heater.,kansascity,cmk1cqb,1,t5_2qngc

3023895,0,t1_coauc6y,Lincoln Prep is a better school than many of the private schools in our area. The city could partner with the district to repurpose many of the vacant school buildings into support centers that provide wrap around services like family counseling tutoring mentoring programs and safe entertainment for the students and surrounding community. No matter what district you go to the kids who are succeeding have adults who are invested in them. Most of the kids who are failing do not have anyone who cares whether they succeed or not. It is in Kansas Citys best economic interest to care about the success of every single kid in KCPS. If we can defeat the stigma that affects enrollment numbers and long term residency in KCs urban core I promise you we would see new investment in our city. Basic city services and an accredited school district are the two best economic development tools we could provide. The more we continue to offer tax increases as a way to increase revenue for economic development downtown the more we will continue to drive residents out of the city. There is a path to a repeal of the ETax but its at least  if not  years in the future and thats only if we have capable leadership consistently providing us with responsible investment in the urban core.,kansascity,cobf9ln,1,t5_2qngc

It isnt always about getting from both locations to the other. This is about getting people from the Northland into Downtown and further if other lines are built without having to drive.

The sweet heat sauce was much better than their regular and x better than their white sauce. Definitely not the best but it would get me a couple hours off work to make the run and a bit of pocket change from everyone pitching in.Definitely stay away from the friesrings though  they fry them in the same oil as their fish and it really picks up the fishy flavor.,kansascity,csz18m4,1,t5_2qngc

4568523,1,t1_ct6bva9,Jobs dont necessarily decrease but there have been several studies show in that it does hamper growth. Both sides have pretty decent stats on minimum wage making it pretty inconclusive. Also most of the cases that have been studied so far are state and federal hikes of the minimum wage. Municipal minimum wages are a relatively new trend in the states. If I were thinking about starting a company that employed low skill workers a federal hike wouldnt impact my planning beyond trying to figure out whether I could make it at that level. State hikes would be similar in most cities where the next state is at least an hour away. But with a municipal hike in a place like Kansas City it would be pretty easy to decide to open my new business in Raytown Leawood Overland Park etc. instead of Kansas City. Business owners tend to be people who wont have a problem traveling a little further to work but minimum wage employees tend to be less mobile. What I see happening here is a decrease in investment in Kansas City for companies with low wage jobs. The barrier to investing in a surrounding city instead is so much lower in this case than with state or federal minimum wage hikes. ,kansascity,ct6h3gu,0,t5_2qngc

5936585,0,t1_cxxrd71,How so? Because they dont remove it from the controlled substances list? If youre referring to Missouris felon in possession statue youre missing an important point even if its not removed from CSA they still have to be convicted to be in violation. That also doesnt take into consideration that the Missouri Supreme Court could favorably interpret Amendment  from last year.If youre referring to the fact that possession would be a violation of the CSA odds are that the courts  in following the rules of statutory interpretation   wouldnt enforce it the way youre thinking because it would create an absurd result. Plus the CSA provides that persons in possession of a controlled substance that was lawfully obtained are not in violation of the law provided other standards are followed I.e. Labeling. Oh and the fact that HHS gets to control the controlled substances list so they could certainly remove it from there. I think the larger problem is that by removing it from the CSA you make it largely unregulated. While thats the end goal for your organization I and probably the majority of others dont feel comfortable with that. ,kansascity,cxxtezy,10,t5_2qngc

I see a punch or . The quotes from the audio though definitely make the video more damning.

Their financial lives were destroyed.This industry is toxic and has to be reformed. And these predators have to be brought to justice.I was going to stop typing there but you know what lets indulge your myopia. Okay so in Kansas City alone payday lenders drain about  million per year out of the local economy. Thats money that was taken from working mothers and fathers or seniors on fixed income  money that would have been spent at local businesses but is instead going to outside payday corporations run by people like Scott Tucker.So what happens to the local businesses that dont see that money?More importantly what happens to the families that are dealing with the misery of getting stretched past the financial breaking point? It affects your health your life expectancy the way you relate to your spouse or your children.So Scott Tucker goes and spends money on absurdly fast cars or vacation homes or to go buy himself the title of pro racer  none of which helps local people or the local economy. Can you imagine what an extra  million of consumer spending in Kansas City would do for the local economy?So when more local businesses have trouble staying open or delay expansion when more kids are underperforming in school because they dont have the support they need at home because mom and dad are either working or worrying trying to get through... when all these things are happening do you think maybe it has an effect on the larger community? On the city? Dare I say even on you? You may never take out a payday loan but they affect you. They make your city less prosperous destabilizing lives and livelihoods.And this is happening all over the country to hundreds of thousands of families.So yes. Yes this matters.These guys are throwing bear traps all over the sidewalk and youre telling people they should watch where theyre walking. Yes people should watch where theyre walking. But the problem is the bear traps.,kansascity,czwmjqz,2,t5_2qngc

The airport was designed for sized planes.  Ill give you the benefit of doubt and go with maybe the gates were repositioned between now and then.   Apparently that would mean they can reposition gate and service assets without razing and rebuilding the airport.  So by your own argument if we ever need to accommodate bigger planes we should be able to do so without a new airport. If its about throughput of large planes...well say that.  Then explain why it matters since most if not all US airlines are changing focus to smaller more efficient planes.gtNot the issue of all gates not having tsa precheck?

Back up terabytes in a few hours and set it to back up continually so you always have a fresh and offsite backup if theres a disaster and your house burns down or you have a massive computer crash that completely kills your hard drive.Having big upload speeds is something you dont take advantage of now because youve never had a reason to.Another thing you could do is install a PLEX server on a home PC and then stream your entire video library to your phone a friends house or whatever you want at full HD speeds.

Its too big of a jump for minimum wage from my PoV. That means stockers and burger flippers and bag boys etc...  Are all making hr. Thats nearly twice the current minimum. Again I dont know much about it but I am inclined to believe that thats going to come with some nasty socioeconomic changes. As to what those are I cant say. I dont know. While my current employment and wage are completely irrelevant to this Ill humor the question. I was recently working as a primarily commercial electrical apprentice. I made . there but they unfortunately closed up shop without notice and left me in a bad spot. Im currently in conduit fabrication and distribution making .hr with a dollar bump next month. Those are labor jobs. Ive been in electrical plumbing logistics distribution and a number of other labor intensive workplaces and still only once have I cleared  and I had to bust my ass for over a year to get that.

8651471,0,t3_4ydahg,I think a food truck is a good idea I would eat there! Theres plenty downtown a few Asian focused ones. One called Bop N Bowl is supposedly like Korean bibimbap but I think its disappointing. They dont have kimchi or other sides that makes bibimbap so awesome just meat and rice basically. The other one Ive seen is KC Pinoy which is the only way Ive seen to get my Filipino food fix. So I think theres definitely room for a Japanese focused food truck. Like Japanese street foods!  Ive never been to Japan but Ive watched some TV shows about street foods there and theres so much amazing looking foods! Also I think having a food truck would be awesome you could travel to festivals or other events as well as setting up anywhere around KC. It seems like every town has a food truck festival so you really could make fans all over the place if you do it well. That way youd get wider exposure.

I havent done this myself but maybe other people could comment on whether this makes sense for an interior totally makes sense for exterior.Also Id suggest painting some rooms different colors.  When Ive looked at homes for sale it seems like a lot of people would just paint one color on the whole house or something which detracts from the look and gives the impression that they just did a lowquality rush job to get it sold.Painting is the single absolute cheapest way to make an entire house either look a lot better or a lot worse so I would put some attention to detail into it...,kansascity,ddkzhq6,2,t5_2qngc

10916034,0,t1_de5nmkx,The bigger point he is trying to make is that after looking at the things you are foragainst  there are some people who will stop at the single payer healthcare part amp just say fucking liberal and stop reading and there are some people who will read you line that you are for OK with firearm ownership with better checks and just say fucking rightwing gun nut.  The point he is trying to make about the tone of politics is that many people want to define political views on one or two issues  and then just lump everyone who has any view that is traditionally associated with one party  as being the extreme end of that party.  I have made no secret here that I voted for Trump.  If you look at the responses to my other posts  I am now a NeoNazi fascist simply because I voted for him.  I repeatedly denounced the actions of the alt right while being told time and time again that I was obviously altright because I voted for Trump.I am proabortion and an atheist but if I say I voted for Trump.... I must be an evangelical Christian who hates abortion.  And if I just mentioned those two issues to someone they would likely assume I was a liberal.  The biggest problem facing America yes bigger than immigration amp terrorism in my personal opinion is our inability to respectfully listen to alternative viewpoints.  To be clear I am just as guilty because when someone starts calling me a racistfascisthomophobicxenophobicmisogynist simply because I tell them I voted for Trump  it becomes very hard to listen to what they have to say with an open mind.  But no matter what  I listen.  It has been the tendency from the left lately to say that anything they disagree with is simply hate speech and that it should not be allowed.  Frankly when I hear someone saying we should exterminate people  I find it disgusting amp hate that people feel that way.  However our country was founded on the right to say whatever you want.  It is when you plan to do or actually do it that we have the ability to legally stop you.  I hate hearing that groups like the altright get attention.  I guarantee their membership increases daily with people who may not agree with their entire philosophy  but are tired of being told by the left that because they dont want illegal immigrants in the country  they are now racistbigoted Nazis.  These folks join amp get indoctrinated into a cause they may not entirely believe in because they are sick of being told they must since they believe in one aspect.  The same happens on the left.  People agree with one issue  and are then grouped in with the most extreme elements.Shit... Gotta go was just getting started.  Bbl,kansascity,de5wu05,1,t5_2qngc

They have skin in the game they dont want it to fail so they will take steps to keep the area desirable. And I would also say part of the success is because it is short and stays in nice areas. i.e. avoids westport and the plazaWhen people talk about extending the street car from downtown to KCI or stadiums I think those are the places where a frequent free safe amp well marketed bus service would be awesome.

Yes there is crime in the area and homeless people but as long as you have a little street smarts you should be fine.  I have known numerous people who have lived in the Northeast thought like I said none at Century Towers and they mostly really like the area.  It is very diverse with immigrants from around the globe and is home to some of the best ethnic food in the city.  Kessler ParkCliff Drive is awesome and Gladstone Blvd around the KC Museum is beautiful.  You would also be very close to Downtown.Where have you lived before?

11524227,0,t1_dfzl9p0,gt KCI is not a house or an office building that can just be fixed with some patchwork here and there.   It NEEDS to have its busiest terminal completely replacedCitation needed.  And preferably not from those who stand to profit from the renovation.gt and the airlines that pay the city a lot of money to use its facilities say so as well.See PDF page  paper page  of the KC Aviation Departments Comprehensive Annual Financial Report For the Years Ended April   and  at  .The single biggest revenue line item is the automobile parking lot at . million dollars in fiscal year .  The total revenue is . million so parking is about  of the total revenue.I think pretty much everything under Terminal Fees and Airfield Fees gets paid by the airlines which totals up to . million in fiscal .  That is approximately  of the total revenue.If one dollar  one vote then the citizens of the area served by KCI who use the parking outrank the airlines.gt Theres no amount of spin or alternative options that will address all of its issues and not be much costlier over timeCitation needed.  And preferably not from those who stand to profit from the renovation.gt the results of the feasibility study that looked into all options agrees.There was a study that said Power and Light was going to pay for itself too and its currently a  million or so drain on the city every year.,kansascity,dg29uar,1,t5_2qngc

11726825,0,t3_67buv9,gt I know its more in the suburbsJust curious but why would this matter? Lenexa is part of Kansas City. Kansas City is largely viewed to be anywhere within Jackson Cass and Clay counties on the Missouri side and Wyandotte and Johnson counties on the Kansas side. The Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget of Kansas City is actually made up of  counties. That list includes the five above as well as Platte Leavenworth Miami Lafayette Ray Clinton Bates Linn and Caldwell counties. Youll get push back on the  secondary counties but youll be hardpressed to find anyone argue that anywhere in the five initially mentioned counties isnt part of Kansas City.
