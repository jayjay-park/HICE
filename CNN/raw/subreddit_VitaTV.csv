259708,0,t3_1v3n1x,Currently there is no Twitch.tv app available for the PS Vita or PS Vita TV in Europe and the US. Probably also not in Japan but Im not sure.,VitaTV,cf7oenl,1,t5_2yg8b
2031513,0,t3_2i0hxr,Not currently at least.  The device supports up to four controllers as of the . update which just came out but the software will need to support it.  Support could be added in an update but that depends on the developers.,VitaTV,cky1t54,1,t5_2yg8b
2132647,0,t1_clavlt7,Yeah. Im still sore about PSTV and Soul Sacrifice at the moment. Cant believe its not supported. ,VitaTV,clawmxo,1,t5_2yg8b
2133735,0,t3_2jdirs,Yeah its really odd. What bugs me the most is I cant remote play to my ps on a  router because it says the connection is too slow even though the PS is wired and the signal on the VitaTV is excellent. Whats even worse is that all tests pass fine on PS Now Beta. So I can stream from some server over the internet... but I cant stream from my PS in the same network.,VitaTV,clb1m4m,1,t5_2yg8b

2325828,0,t1_clz3oba,I dont think you can have a controller synced to multiple devices.. I could be wrong but if I recall having to resync it when i used it on the PS and then on the vitaTV.,VitaTV,clz6pdi,1,t5_2yg8b

2633256,0,t1_cn28n9p,yep as usudobyte said you just need to apply the update to play it even says added support for pstv in the patch notes Keep in mind that most games made for ps vita except tales of heart R were developed before the launch of the ps tv so they dont work wo an update like killzone borderlands  etc.,VitaTV,cn2atoy,3,t5_2yg8b
2757107,0,t3_2rnebq,Duke Nukem is compatible with PS TV.  Not sure what youre talking about.Not every game will be compatible but thats totally fine with me because I think of PS TV as a console on its own with crosssupport with Vita  PSM titles.As for Netflix I can access it from my PS PS Vita DS Wii U PC and Smartphone.  It wasnt a selling point for me the games were and I did my research before making the jump.  Totally satisfied with my purchase.,VitaTV,cnhgzu9,2,t5_2yg8b

3524111,0,t3_30mm0r,I have been treating it as a supercompact PS PSP and PSVita. Of course there are caveats to using each namely availability of games but what it can play it plays well. Lack of Netflix and Dracula X Chronicles have made it fall quite short of my expectations.  Based on what youve said though it sounds like the PSTV isnt for you so Id see if you can return it. Im sure your brother would understand if you explain that it cant do what you andor he wanted to do with it. He probably had greater expectations for it too we all did.,VitaTV,cptz2me,1,t5_2yg8b
3734490,0,t1_cqhnler,Thanks dude. I hear u on the analog stick bit. I started playing fnd liked it so much that i bought F as well. Shocked to find that F doesnt support analog stick on vita version and also lack of button calibration.,VitaTV,cqhyfzu,1,t5_2yg8b

3933638,0,t3_35i5fs,Thats very strange.  Id try powering off the PSTV and see if it changes.  If not I would  Remove the memory card and power it back on.   Let it rebuild the database Power it off again reinsert memory card and power it back on,VitaTV,cr4o4k7,2,t5_2yg8b
3955116,0,t1_cr1fkv3,Pretty much doing everything you said and it has worked very nice for me since I got the PSTV tried with GTAV AC Unity so far and it has been great. I have tried the PSTV on both wireless and LAN and it works in both settings just fine. My PS is hard wired and I have turned direct connect off so connect via internet Both Resolution  Frame Rate are set to High and main resolution  iThe only thing is that for the room upstairs in my house I have a nd router which acts as an AP and it connects to the downstairs main router via gigabit network which is connected by wired to the PS so this creates a wireless roaming in the house so devices can connect to whichever router that is the closest and have the strongest connection.I will be testing this PSTV on a trip away soon so well see how it will work from the outside. The Vita just does fine so I hope this does as well.You might want to start a thread in VitaTV giving all your tips because I have read many threads where people complain about the connectivity  game play but it seems good so far. Ill try Bloodborne later this evening.,VitaTV,cr7480e,1,t5_2yg8b

4385208,0,t3_3b8poy,Hold the ps button and there is an option you can tick to press in L or R for front or rear touchpad functions for the ps controller. It would be recommended to get a  controller because the touchpad replaces the need to move the cursor yourself with the analogue stick. ,VitaTV,csjy6wq,2,t5_2yg8b

6061158,0,t3_3yi7r4,They arent blacklisted theyre whitelisted.  Only the games that are specifically named can be played on a PSTV and that only happens when the publisher verifies its playability and lack of bugs.

If there is a game or two that you want to play now you can even push the downloads out to any PS console right from the web interface. With all six free games listed on one page theres no reason not to just added them all to your cart and check out.

7004354,0,t3_4bk2wj,I think I am going to have to say thank you to K and Firaxis on twitter.  It seems really unexpected to see them port it to vita so long after they ported it to PS. I like that they took advantage of the touch screen but it also sucks that it doesnt work on PStv. I cant complain to much though. I got the game free or sale for PS and I have it in my steam library but I have yet to ever play it. ,VitaTV,d1aadpr,1,t5_2yg8b
