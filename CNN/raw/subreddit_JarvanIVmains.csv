8536936,0,t3_4vs20n,Yea I hate this bug so bad.  It also sucks when enemies can flash or dash out of the ult damage if they time it perfectly.  Sometimes I actually prefer the old single target ult for this reason.,JarvanIVmains,d68omgc,1,t5_3avc1
9299577,0,t3_57qruv,What elo is this and why dont they ever come at me one at the time...Seriously lately if enemy team knows i am playing top j i have to go tank as they take  exhaust and never use it on my adc...,JarvanIVmains,d8usdm6,1,t5_3avc1
10773897,0,t1_ddqoaho,Did you ever try to talk to riot about this? Also to be honest at first thought it seems that would be broken yes but the combo itself is so hard to pull off the timing of flash and relatively small hitbox and the fact that lee can just run up after his wardwflashrun  unitsrqq while if j missed eq and didnt reach target he has no chance to run up to enemy to start his combo that I doubt many people would risk doing it and be left in the middle of enemy team with no eq or flash available and NOT knock up the person or missnot reach. The counterargument can be  well its hard to pull off proper insecs from half screen away but people attemptdo it anyway. But that is tank lee who insecs into his team and if he fails he is OK to run awaytank for a good amount of time. Meanwhile squishy ad lee doesnt need to do it to be effective he can just or was able to  patches ago to just kill person with rqq or even qqr and still have his wardw ANDor flash to get away. So it seems balanced in that perspective to give j this very high risk high reward play potential.Edit in analogy with Lee again that would be same as Lees wardwflashr and from now on enemy cant control their champ unless they qss qqaa. Then he is left with no escape tool. Same as js eqflash combo IF it applied q damage but js combo has to land exactly while Lee has pretty big range on his R. Also the execute part of Lee q is comparable to the armor pen applications of js q. Overall these  combos are very similar in nature and damage but j is cheated off his q damage WHILE his combo is harder again timing of flash and small hitbox and no chance to run up to enemy as Lee can to RThis is unfair ,JarvanIVmains,ddr8znk,1,t5_3avc1
10779797,0,t1_ddro77h,Your entire argument is nothing if the j player opts to flash eq ultimate instead of eq flash ultimate. LOLYoure not forced to eq flash at all  just aim the eq after flash to retain the damage. Jesus. I think youre more focused on trying to be right than actually consider a real fucking situation in league.And once again the damage hitbox isnt being moved or repositioned on either abilities because youre flashing after... You have to realize that in isolation Jarvan getting this buff would be ridiculous no matter what. Youre comparing him to Lee Sin whilst not taking into account the fact that within a real situation  its strong REGARDLESS of whether Lee Sin is better or not in terms of damage. Ill go get a Rioters position on this brb lmao,JarvanIVmains,ddruw09,2,t5_3avc1
10863824,0,t3_5ux71b,My ults are canceling a lot specially vs Lucians and Ezreals.I mean not canceling but doing no damage as soon as they dash.,JarvanIVmains,de0iyyl,2,t5_3avc1
11124470,0,t3_5yqtoe,Either way they better take what we say into account.The guy hasnt had anything much beyond value changes since aoe ult.,JarvanIVmains,desy6rs,2,t5_3avc1
11493979,0,t1_dfxq3pj,are you saying cotc is good on j or is grasp still ideal,JarvanIVmains,dfyub3c,1,t5_3avc1
11558085,0,t1_dg5ni0m,Titanic is getting indirectly nerfed in the next patch though due to the lowering of health on most tank items. Grasp becomes even better because the health you leech back is harder to be removed again because of the higher resistances,JarvanIVmains,dg6431i,2,t5_3avc1
11623859,0,t1_dgdd02k,Youre missing the point. Iceborn does same burst as cleaver so if your team cant follow up.. Then you are just gonna die faster. Black cleaver might be better in v and v skirmishes.. But then again in that case botrk would be better ,JarvanIVmains,dgdkqr6,1,t5_3avc1
