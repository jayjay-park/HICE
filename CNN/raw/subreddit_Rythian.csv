47826,1,t1_cejt9ey,No he didnt he made mistakes left right and center especially with Kim who should be one of his most op units and instead of her getting  sniper shots on the sectoid commander each with a possible  damage and one would have been a definite crit he decided to go up to it and use his shitty pistol for a whopping  damage now he has rookies that have probably got next to no will and he is about to be pincered by  cyberdisks on one side and a coalition of mutons and crysalids on the other side. Over all Id say he got lucky a few times with his shots and hell ultimately throw some of his troops away by his inability to use simple strategy in positioning his troops!,Rythian,cejvirk,1,t5_2x1ca
54824,0,t1_ceknfro,To be honest Im surprised he hasnt went after them yet because if you go after them early.  They are no issue because theyre dead but the mechtoid is no  issue at the moment.,Rythian,ceko6ps,4,t5_2x1ca

229727,0,t3_1wqsyq,Its one thing to revisit a map. Its another thing to take the same council mission within two different playthoughs. DEJA VU INTENSIFIES.But yeah the thing is that the Slingshot and...Portent? one threw off the Council mission stuff. So yeah.,Rythian,cf4k4qm,1,t5_2x1ca

697587,0,t3_224wm0,I hope Rythian is aware of some of the lore involving old Garrett that was in the asylum. It made the place much more interesting to me though no less spooky.,Rythian,cgjkgja,2,t5_2x1ca

760773,0,t3_22v8m9,Ive waited patently for this playthrough to end and hear your review before giving my own.  .  I expected the story to mainly revolve around Garret. I dont mind adding a secondary character as long as they had an important role in the story. But to me She didnt have that important part I was seeking. She was more of the little sister figure that Garret the  big brother   was watching over. And she got into all kinds of trouble. She was also his complete opposite. Its sort of a clich character. And the story itself was also a little clich. Little sister gets into trouble and big brother runs around a massive town to look for her. It was more of a wild goose chase than an actual story line. Even Dishonored had a better story line than that. The only good thing that came from her was the claw. Which was incredibly useful. Other than that The game could of and probably should of ben better off without her.  The sound bugs where also a bit annoying. And I can see why you disliked that. Hearing the same thing over and over would also drive me up the wall. Along with the dialog which is nothing new or exciting. You would think that a game which cost so much would have a lot more than pretty graphics. Apparently That wasnt so. I also understand the frustration of the log being the only loading screen and cut scenes being cut off early. Things like that would annoy the hell out of me. If I where to pay more than  for a game then I would expect it to be a damned good one. So I understand your frustration.  .  Hopefully the next Thief game wont be just about pretty graphics.,Rythian,cgqr89i,5,t5_2x1ca
822398,0,t3_23ix1e,That was a really sad mission and I kinda wish that was the one thats canon. The whole WoL campaign went by all together much too lightly for a war final missions excluded.,Rythian,cgxrbdw,3,t5_2x1ca

1017003,0,t3_25qz97,Id recommend something like Murdered Soul Suspect or Watchdogs though that one would likely be covered by others too. The first one might be up his street but I can only guess here. Downside is that it isnt out for at least  weeks more.,Rythian,chjw26t,1,t5_2x1ca
