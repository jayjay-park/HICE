7829004,0,t1_d3w1p4z,Inverse kinematics    gtInverse kinematics refers to the use of the kinematics equations of a robot to determine the joint parameters that provide a desired position of the endeffector. Specification of the movement of a robot so that its endeffector achieves a desired task is known as motion planning. Inverse kinematics transforms the motion plan into joint actuator trajectories for the robot. gtThe movement of a kinematic chain whether it is a robot or an animated character is modeled by the kinematics equations of the chain. These equations define the configuration of the chain in terms of its joint parameters. Forward kinematics uses the joint parameters to compute the configuration of the chain and inverse kinematics reverses this calculation to determine the joint parameters that achieves a desired configuration.

9781076,0,t3_5f9jk7,They Minsky and Pappert proved that Perceptrons are limited in what they can compute. To be specific they are unable to act as a  boolean XOR function. However this limitations applies only to single layer perceptrons. They knew that this limitation applied mainly to single layer perceptrons multilayer perceptrons with global connectivity dont have this problem.,neuralnetworks,daiqd1o,3,t5_2zlbk
