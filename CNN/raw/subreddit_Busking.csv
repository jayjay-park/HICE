7181850,0,t1_d1ugmxk,Ive tested my wifes intentions to her very essence. She empathizes with the people that very few people are willing to. I am a terrible human being and she is the purest person that I have ever known. You seem to be concerned with harassing her cause rather than trying to make the world a better place. Tonight she spent her evening making fucking backpacks and filling them with toiletries. We will be downtown tomorrow handing them out to the homeless. You should come by and help. Alternatively you could continue planting seeds of evil.,Busking,d1uihkn,6,t5_2sl7f
7866835,0,t3_4mppgj,Be friendly and respectful but firm with boundaries in case mental illness or incapacity is at play explain that you need the space to make your money as most people will understand and respect that especially panners. Having cigarettes to offer sometimes helps. And as you say sometimes you just gotta pack up and go especially if you are concerned for your safety. Some people would tell you to stand your ground and get aggressive but to me its just not worth the risk.,Busking,d40azlw,2,t5_2sl7f
