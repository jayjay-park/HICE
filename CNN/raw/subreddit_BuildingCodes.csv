2740718,0,t3_2rgebc,not sure how it works in the states but here in Australia the councils are trawling google maps to discover un permited buildings.My inlaws got a call about an unpermitted extension to their home it turns out it was a patio with a permit that was overgrown with ivy so on google maps it looked like the had a roof.  When they sent the notice we asked them what evedence they had of the extension the explained they looked on google maps.  All worked out when we told them it was ivy on the top of the patio,BuildingCodes,cnflwk8,2,t5_32ofg

9469234,0,t1_d9g9oek,I dont know exactly what code all I know is what was just drilled into my head in my Architecture class I was just supposed to memorize stair code which states exterior stairs are different at least they are in PA.  At least where I live the rise must be between  and the tread ltcorrected from previous post but Im fairly certain this is correct PA has been taking on stricter building codes so if anything this would definitely be to code and would be more accessible to people having trouble going up stairs.,BuildingCodes,d9gaelw,1,t5_32ofg
