4626723,0,t3_3ecvju,Tian  Heaven is not really a place so much as a way of saying The Almighty  God but not as personified. Does that make any sense? As far as Chinese afterlife concepts there are many more Hells  Daoist Buddhist and local folk religions. I would like to know what the Confucian idea of Heaven would be  beyond that of becoming a venerated Ancestor?,ChineseHistory,ctdrqyn,1,t5_2tdvi

9428182,0,t3_58b37v,People intermarry. That is like saying that you want to separate out the ethnicities in Romania among those who call themselves Romanian. Good freaking luck. The Han and Huaxia beforejust a name change have been a mixed mutt group even from the time of the Xia if youre to take the Xia at face value. They consist of those who culturally identify with the dominant culture. The ancestry after a couple of generations is simply rewritten. Ethnicity is semi arbitrary. Is German a citizenshipnationality or and ethnicitynationality?  What about Danish? Or Scandinavian? Are they all Germanic? Which one is an ethnicity and which dont count?,ChineseHistory,d9b3527,2,t5_2tdvi
