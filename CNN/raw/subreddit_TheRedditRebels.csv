3352243,0,t1_cpa8ohb,Edit  They cite a post from the LSA back in January as proof to wrong doing REBL didnt exist then. From uahugewaffle  And I had seen AWOOD posted he was recruiting new members in a session that day which led me to believe he was attempting to poach our members not only is he actively following what awood does he is making wrong assumptions. Again this is an issue their end not ours... This guy is also commenting about trolling may I remind him about the messages he sent to us when REBL was first formed? Again Ive messaged utresboi to speak about these issues Ive had nothing but silence which further shows that they are making wrong assumptions about REBL and our intentions.  Im also banned from rGTAA not sure why but hey ho no great loss. They also say were unorganized etc... Looking through both subreddits we can see who is truly unorganized. When crew leaders are saying things like I dont know who in the leader team does that.... Meh its their opinion I guess.From what I can tell its more that their leaders have an obsession with awood and our crew. Weve never sought them out for anything its entirely one sided.,TheRedditRebels,cpadphe,1,t5_368hy

4411600,0,t3_3bhgak,I like the limited platform approach.  This ensures that the crew isnt segmented into a bunch of different platform silos and gives people the option to play with most others in the crew.
