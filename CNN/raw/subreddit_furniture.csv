1253790,0,t3_284un4,I really like the style of the desks especially the emphasis on multiple configurations.  You could even promote the four desks being joined in a round for a larger conference orientation.  I see that you thought about cord management for power.  How about a smoothercurved feature for reducing the friction of your mouse cord against the edge of the desk?  I like the modern feel and while I personally dislike the color red works nicely for it overall.  Is there a specific function to the rubber flap and is the red surface on the smaller tables something functional?  Either way it is a nice looking detail.  The meetup table is something I would probably revisit or at least its legs.  Aesthetically it looks like something by fisher price.  Either the legs are too big or too red that it falls out of proportion with the desks.  The best solution would probably be to try and match the style of the desk legs but tapering the legs might be an interesting route as it would bring down the visual mass of red and add just a hint of retro to the contemporary vibe.  Sometimes such an anomaly can work nicely.  The only other thing Id consider is getting more human interaction into the desks.  An example would be softer corners to reduce anything snagging when walking around to your chair.  Think about the person sitting here for  hours a week or walking tofrom the desk.  Hope this is helpful and Nice work!,furniture,ciao07f,1,t5_2qir2

One thing I see missing from your list is an industrial sewing machine. Youll have a very hard time upholstering that back with out seams. ,furniture,cj5k3xn,1,t5_2qir2

Dont use any harsh detergents youll destroy the finish. Eventually itll become as comfortable as your favorite pair of jeans. Good luck.,furniture,cyq40ob,2,t5_2qir2
