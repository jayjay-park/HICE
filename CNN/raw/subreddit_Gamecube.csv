You need an SVideo cable for the GameCube third parties make them and theyre fully supported they replace your entire compositeaudio cable bundle and a TV or home theatre receiver with an SVideo input jack.

So if you were go get a SCART to YUV converter that could work for SNES and if your pockets are deep enough then go for the Component cables for the Cube.

5679579,0,t3_3sw9gh,If you have Phantasy Star Online the ethernet adapter it comes with and youre decently comfortable with how your router works you can run homebrew on the Gamecube by using a DNS exploit for PSO. This includes playing Gamecube games but since the ethernet adapter is locked in at such a slow speed this can sometimes make highdatarate things like cutscene playback a bit choppy. It also means that games that stream audio from the disc Star Fox Adventures the Rogue Squadron games etc. will have missing audio or not work at all.A much easier way to do this is to find an old Wii that has Gamecube inputs i.e. not the very last generation of Wiis where they removed the Gamecube controller and memory card ports. Wiis are trivially easy to softmod  all you need is an SD card though you may also want a USB hard disk to store games on. Once youve modded the Wii theres a program called DIOS MIOS that allows to you run most Gamecube games from properly formatted ISOs. I think theres also a newer solution than DIOS MIOS with slightly better compatibility? I havent used it myself though.TLDR Its possible but youll have to buy some obscure hardware. IMO youre better off finding an old Wii  youll still be able to use your original Gamecube controllers and memory cards even.,Gamecube,cx13wg9,2,t5_2sbwh

You download the .z from the thread there and open it with a program like zip or winrar inside youll find a folder called swissr and inside that folder will be different folders which contain specific ways of launching swiss. If you want to burn it to a disc you simply choose the options in the ISO folder where there are  .iso files depending on your gamecube region. Burn one of thoose files to a minidvd or a fullsize dvd if you have a modified gamecube case that can handle normal size discs and swiss should boot right up when the disc is in your gamecube given that you have a modchip to boot burned discs,Gamecube,d66jdeu,1,t5_2sbwh

10571795,0,t3_5qm4wd,I have a hard time answering this question  mainly because I got my component cables at a Play N Trade that was shutting down a few years back ? for   but to me the difference is profound. With the cables GameCube games look great on a flatscreen and amazing on a CRT. I cannot go back to playing GameCube games with the standard composite cable anymore. In my opinion the output of the GameCubes component video even exceeds the Wiis which I found to be quite blurry I own a launch Wii so take this as you will. Ive heard that launch Wiis have blurrier output. That said I could never spend  on them. I love my GameCube but  is too much to justify. At this point to somebody who doesnt already own the cables I would suggest modding a Wii U and just playing your GameCube games on Nintendont. If you miss the boot animation Nintendont actually supports using a BIOS dump from a GameCube making the experience very genuine. Coupled with the official GameCube adapter games play exactly the same. Of course you cannot hookup a GBA to the controller ports or utilize a Game Boy Player but the resulting HDMI output looks pretty much the same as the component cables to me.In answer to your question about knock offs they dont exist. The cable contains a proprietary chip that converts the digital signals from the port to a YPbPr signal for your TV. If knock offs existed the price of the real deal would be substantially cheaper.,Gamecube,dd6ebzi,1,t5_2sbwh
