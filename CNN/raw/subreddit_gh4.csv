1485879,0,t1_cj2iiye,You did an amazing job with the handheld then!Neat was a godsend with my GH. Less so with the GH again the K noise is a whole different animal and largely disappears when down sampled and exported. Once you have it I encourage you to print a target and make profiles for the various ISOs under various conditions. If you spend a little time doing this upfront you never have to do it again. ,gh4,cj2j380,1,t5_31pgw

4093099,0,t1_crmtt0i,Put GH and the lenses you used in your Vimeo description that way people that search for gh videos can find it easily. You might also want to put what you graded it in etc. Maybe try posting that link to the videography and filmography subreddits? This subreddit is a bit of a ghost town. ,gh4,crmu72r,2,t5_31pgw

4226879,0,t3_39973s,Assuming I owned no other lenses and I only had  I would get TWO lenses. Panasonic Lumix G Vario mm F.. II ASPH Mega OISANDPanasonic Lumix G Vario mm F. ASPH Mega OISIts true they arent as good as the  f. and the  f.. But the value is insane. They are ridiculously small light and quick to focus. While the image quality isnt top of the line its still fantastic. You can capture terrific images with these lenses and there enough range that you will rarely be unable to get a shot because you dont have a lens at the right focal length.,gh4,cs21ha2,1,t5_31pgw
4319338,0,t1_cscij4e,It has something to do with the lens as well.....If I can find the thread Ill post it here.Worked for me anyway.Best of luck!,gh4,cscinr7,2,t5_31pgw

6260314,0,t1_cvlp8xz,Glad to have found someone with my same setup or close enough. I have a Canon EF mm L mm L and a Sigma mm Art and just ordered the GH and Metabones XL .x speedbooster.Do you find yourself sticking with your EF lenses most of the time or do you use native lenses at all? ,gh4,cz188ur,1,t5_31pgw
6383786,0,t3_433j76,If you want to record audio into the camera yes.  Maybe look into used GHs?  Its a durable camera  I wouldnt have much worry buying a used one.,gh4,czf9nmo,1,t5_31pgw
6788177,0,t3_48mkui,I always say buy your bodies used and lenses new. I wholeheartedly vote for buying a GH now. It will be high enough quality to last you for many years. Plus it can always be upgraded to output RAW video.,gh4,d0lq7rt,1,t5_31pgw
7115399,0,t1_d1mjak8,Im glad you like the results but my advise stems from a lot of testing and well math.The fact is VLOG L in an bit bucket is inferior in such a way as to empirically effect image quality and some of those ways are nearly impossible to repair in post. It wastes about  of the very limited available bandwidth leading to quantization and compression errors most egregious being bad chroma smearing in flat neutral errors but also affecting gradients like sky.In short VLOG L recorded internally is very fragile. The whole point of a LOG profile is to give you more room to push it in post. VLOG L does not do that. It in fact gives you less wiggle room. It is a very strict mistress.Color reproduction is not any better its the same and the usable gain in dynamic range is very small  stop if you ETTR . stop if you expose to the meter. Without a monitoring LUT its harder to expose and harder focus.All this being true and youll see it is if you evaluate your images objectively youre left with the question...WHY use VLOG L internally?,gh4,d1mxibo,2,t5_31pgw
7126691,0,t3_4d5t9q,All my glass is EF and I use the metabones speedbooster.For handheld scenarios where I need stabilization I use the D kit lens mm f and am pretty happy with it. Handheld to me is not a stylistic choice I willingly choose though. I view it more as a runngun solution.Pretty great results though.,gh4,d1o81j6,1,t5_31pgw

9759931,0,t3_5ew2uv,Because why would you want someone to choose what lens is best for you? You buy the body then you buy the lens that best suites the work you will use the camera for. If you are newer to video production and are looking for an entry level this is what you need camera kit or just an add a tripod why dont you go and buy a camcorder? An all encompassing product that you dont have control over. Pardon me if this comes off as harsh. ,gh4,dag4ofx,2,t5_31pgw
9879305,0,t1_dav6hgc,Thanks! Do you post travel vids at all with the GH that I could check out?A big thing for me will be shooting in k. To go lighter I want to ditch my fluid head tripod and just film mostly static shots on a lightweight tripod and add movement by downscaling in post. ,gh4,davaoy6,1,t5_31pgw

10634591,0,t3_5qt4rb,Guys just wondering which speed booster is best for the Sigma??There is the canon mount or the nikon mount  the canon being far more expensive than the nikon.I already have a canon mm macro lens and I also like the look of the mm . so is it worth just getting the Canon mount speed booster??Also ND filters  I like the idea of the variable ones but have read they leave strange artifacts etc on the footage?? Can anyone suggest what brandstrengths would be best for video use??Many thanks.,gh4,ddcvkxi,1,t5_31pgw

10726818,0,t1_ddm0hvs,From that article the playback of the images on the rear monitor lacks contrast and the images seem muted and even soft. In fact during my entire experience with the camera I was fairly certain that the images were not turning out well. When I loaded them into Lightroom I was pleasantly surprised with the results.This is my biggest issue when shooting with it. When shooting video the screen seems to display very crisp giving you exactly what you shot but reviewing photos is absolutely awful. I wish they could make some update to this so that they wouldnt look so soft the instant after you click the shutter. Its really too bad and makes me want to keep shooting on my old ti.,gh4,ddme3ie,1,t5_31pgw
10755081,0,t1_ddor45f,Its the risk one takes when buying used. You can buy used gear off BampH. I bought my GH used from there over a year ago. Usually they are just open box items from cheapasses buyingusingreturning instead of renting. ,gh4,ddpb0d2,1,t5_31pgw

10876181,0,t1_de1ph77,IBIS would be nice so that I can use lenses like my Sigma  and speedbooster combo handheld.  Without it is too shaky.  I dont handhold that much though  most is tripod and slider though I may get more expoconference work and would be shooting handheld more.Ive had the GH since right after it came out and got the G a year and a half ago for like .  Ill replace the G with the G at some point.  The features dont warrant me spending k on it at the moment when my kit is pretty solid for my needs at the moment. I dont want to trade my GH for the G because Id want the headphone jack for certain situations.  Ill wait till I find a sale on the G.  I try not to buy gear until I have a gig that really could use it or it is cheap.  Buying the latest when youve got a pretty good kit is a good way to waste money.,gh4,de1stzu,1,t5_31pgw
