For instance French are much more eager to interrupt and do not seem to have take interruptions as an affront in comparison to AngloSaxons. Take Le grand journal de Canal where everyone is constantly interrupting each other compared to comparable talk shows in the UK or the US. French are constanlty having to prove their fast thinking skills by interrupting one another Brits are more likely to compare their wit in more alternating volleys.,culturalstudies,ciuihvq,3,t5_2qhwb

8371085,0,t1_d2napgt,A lack of the perception of relationship or systemic perception is normal in society now and can be seen in everything and all of the time in complete contrast to the truth. People see the vertex and never the edge. One more act of censorship. ,culturalstudies,d5nxoyl,1,t5_2qhwb
