8303972,0,t3_4t9622,A half back and an anchor man are pretty stationary. A half back sits back with your defensive line without the ball and an anchor man sits in between the centerbacks and the midfield giving you an option to recycle possession when you have the ball. The defensive midfielder depends on what duty you have but usually hell go further forward and support the transition to attack.,TheFootballManagers,d5fjxyp,5,t5_3ffft

8347304,0,t3_4tx3e4,I take it from your team instructions you want to play possession football? You have only  extremely isolated midfielders meaning youll be outnumbered and will struggle to control the ball higher up the pitch. If you want to play in a  s pretty suicidal tbh then Id recommend going much more defensive and direct at the minute I feel youre not entirely sure how you want the team to play perhaps?.  Depending on if you want to play possession or a style more suited to your players will decide where you should go from there.  But at the minute playing a deep dline and the offside trap is not usually a good mix without exceptionally good players and playing a CB on cover will mean he might get caught playing people onside.  Youve also set your team to play narrow as your on counter yet at the same time are trying to exploit the flanks likely leaving your wingers very isolated aswell as the CMsEDIT I agree with WJ Id decide what kind of football you want to play then start from scratch tbh,TheFootballManagers,d5kysep,2,t5_3ffft
