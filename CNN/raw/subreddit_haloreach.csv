3754672,0,t3_2qshaw,Is this thread still existing? I want to add my opinion.You said armor lock is easy to defend against and sometimes it is. The reason I dont like it is because I primarily rely on close range battle such as melee when battling. Armor lockers kill me every time because as I punch they armor lock. This stuns me so I cant run away. They come out of armor lock the EMP breaks my shields they melee and Im dead. Most times I can break their shields but never can I kill them. I know no way to counter that. When in close range battle its just intuition to hit the guy but that often hurts me more than them. Really armor lock can be used similar to a shotgun so I believe its a fair strategy but like shotguns or swords or hammers I never use it because I dont enjoy when people use them on me.Any advice on how to deal with that situation?  ,haloreach,cqk9d84,1,t5_2rmma
5653234,0,t3_3sjqnf,Because when i took over control of the game they stripped almost all of the Anniversary maps out of their respective playlists. Hence there is no longer BTB Anniversary either.Edit It may actually have happened after they took over,haloreach,cwxu7q0,2,t5_2rmma
