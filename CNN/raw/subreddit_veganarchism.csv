3531971,0,t1_cputh7v,Youre probably right that what I said wasnt stated in the best way. Im not saying we need to just be understanding towards meat eaters and that its morally acceptable for them to just change a tiny bit at a time. It isnt.gtNow let us apply that to a reformed rapist and imagine him statingAs a former rapist I think current rapists need some understanding. We cannot just expect them to stop raping overnight! Babysteps we dont want to seem to radical or feminist.The difference here is that rape isnt socially acceptable and that a large majority of society feel that it is reasonable to stop raping overnight. Pretty much what you saidgtChanging habits in the public at large requires money social power and a logistics that vegans simply dont have and wont anytime soon.I just dont think its abandoning morality by going about this in a way that is the only realistic way to create a change for the forseeable future.,veganarchism,cpuvaf5,3,t5_2uu0g
4316577,0,t3_3afo7f,Well theres two ways to take it regardless you need to remember that designed is absolutely the wrong term to use Just because humans ate meat doesnt mean eating meat is automatically the best thing for a human to do. Who gives a FUCK what early humans did? Early humans would rape each other and beat their neighbor to death for being camped out in a better fruit tree. Appeals to morality based on prehistoric naturalism are nonsensical without exception.,veganarchism,csc7erh,18,t5_2uu0g

4457962,0,t1_csoglnl,Where does this fat shaming accusation come from? This term gets thrown around so liberally that it has become meaningless. It seems like simply talking about healthy food is now considered fat shaming. Whatever he said I have a hard time believing his approach is wrong considering that he has saved the lives of thousands of people who were on the brink of death throughout his career. ,veganarchism,csslv5n,-2,t5_2uu0g

4694454,0,t1_ctm8xa9,gt What would your stance be on letting them continue human sacrifice?This isnt even relevant. Regardless of the HumanNonHuman subjects being entirely different please call me speciest... those are ceremonies designed to control and subjugate the population through religious domination and fear. Same with cannibalism  jeez dude at least use relevant examples that pertain to nonhuman exploitation to back up your claim. Further in my first comment I already explained how I think there is a major divide between QuasiReligious ceremonies and deterritorialized HumanNonhuman relationships  like I dont disagree with you as much as you think I do but at least give me pertinent examples to work with.Second Colonialism wasnt anything placing it as an artifact of the past but it still is an active and very violent and pervasive force that many of us do on a regular basis because thats what WhiteWestern culture is founded on  the bones and ashes of destroyed civilizations to be assimilated into proper and unsavage living. Its not strictly European anymore  NeoColonialism is happening right now by you and I and its totally remiss to think that you or any of us are exempt from it because we arent establishing literal colonies for means of empire expansion.It doesnt matter what you or I think at all  this conversation is happening between folks who are actually part of the culture and a relevant part of this conversation. You and I are or should be at least bystanders to learn and listen. There is really great stuff happening like this well known essay Veganism And Mikmaq Legends Feminist Natives Do Eat Tofu without a lot of pushback from nonVegan Natives. There is movement happening in what I and you too perceive to be a positive shift in Native cultural critique but WE CANT BE AN ACTIVE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION otherwise its just another instance of Colonial ideological domination  I simply dont know how to explain it any other way. Obviously Im passionate about the importance of my diet Mine is the most upvoted comment in this entire thread but I cant transfer that passion to something I dont understand and that has historically and currently been the subject of my privilege. ,veganarchism,ctm9z6b,1,t5_2uu0g
