1598018,0,t3_2cklbn,All my commentsposts have been complaining but I cant help but feel the universe is shitting on me extra hard lately. Today was supposed to be my last day of BC and I was supposed to start stimming on Friday. Thats not happening now because of my gallbladder and after I get it out I have to start from the beginning again.  days of provera and  days of BC. So that sucks. Edit I just want to have a fucking baby and not feel like everything is trying to keep that from happening. ,InfertilitySucks,cjglkwm,3,t5_32qt5
1598526,0,t1_cjglkwm,Alright Im telling you this hopefully because it will make you feel better if it doesnt make you feel better then feel free to tell me to go fuck myself. After IVF  I wanted to do IVF  right away but my period came  days late which meant I couldnt do IVF  until we got back to the US from visiting my family over xmas. Had my period come just one day before it would have been fine. I was very very angry.Eventually I decided to just enjoy myself over the holidays and not worry about what I was eating etc. Then right before we were about to leave I got sick. Very very sick. I was lucky to not be hospitalized the doctor considered it I had a massive infection some number of something or other was through the roof we were unsure if Id even be able to travel home.I did get to travel home but I was delirious. When I got home I took another two weeks off work to get better which further delayed IVF  I was supposed to start it immediately when we got home but couldnt because I was so sick. So I didnt even start the pills until February the stimming retrieval and transfer were all in March this was almost  months later than I wanted!I felt like everything that could go wrong was going wrong. And now of course Im so glad it did.Its really stupid and awful too but if I hadnt had a miscarriage with IVF  I wouldnt have my son. That just hurts my head.,InfertilitySucks,cjgnvxk,1,t5_32qt5
