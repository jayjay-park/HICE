1428866,0,t1_civc4zq,I dont think that by doing a course in NLP I could replicate my exgirlfriends fathers results. He after all is a very different person to me. I would like to model some of his behaviours though and NLP is a good way to do this. ,NLP,civdvz7,1,t5_2qqpg
1696013,0,t1_cjsmqd9,Thanks for the reply I think mirroring is a good place to start. However mirroring and matching has several aspects to it. I will try to break it down into manageable parts. Overall posture placement of hands position of feet and direction of the head. Would it be reasonable to group those together? Moving onto gestures used by people. Certain motions they use their arms and hands in. I like to observe and as the interaction moves on I will subtly adopt such motions. From there I think facial expressions deserves its own group. Eyebrows the way somebody smiles. Paul Ekmans research is excellent for becoming familiar with the face though not necessary for mirroring. Tone of voice speed of speech quality of voice. I have noticed a dramatic response in real time when I start to match and mirror somebodies voice tonality. Then down to breathing rate personally the hardest for me. I put these in order of what was easiest to hardest for me starting with placement of hands and position of feet being the easiest for me and breathing rate being the hardest. Sometimes it was easier for me to observe first a little bit then try mirroring.   The weekly topic idea is great and I think we may as well start with mirroring.I am not an NLP master by any means however I would love to discuss any questions comments or feedback with anybody. thanks!,NLP,cjsy24p,3,t5_2qqpg
2971111,0,t3_2u5a67,On the road right now but wanted to add something. Since you brought up body language Ill share this. Not reacting to something is very powerful. Otherwise people will recognize your motives and normally become resistant. Suggesting something directly to someone has had less success than some other approaches for me. IF something doesnt work try anything else. NLP has a lot to offer. I was very open minded in my approach but it has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my life. If you are specifically looking just towards body language what every body is saying by Joe Navarro is a book I thought useful. Dont limit yourself though ,NLP,co5twqz,0,t5_2qqpg

5104941,0,t3_3kmo5e,One of the best examples of coaching Ive had the pleasure of witnessing was one of my teachers literally guilttripping a girl into ceasing to selfdeprecate.It was quite some time ago however it was basically making her feel guilty about feeling guilty and selfdeprecating. It was one of the most bizarre things Ive seen done with NLP.As for victimblaming life isnt fair and if you let it it will kick your ass. Ultimately nobody can be prepared for every situation that can arise in ones life.Regarding the quote you postedgtIt is not easy to recognize that by blaming someone else that you are handing power over to them. By blaming someone else you don the mantle of the victim.You dont seem to recognize this. By blaming someone else you are admitting that they have more agency in a given situation than you do you open yourself up to their influence due or undue. By giving another person this agency over your life youre victimizing yourself in a very negative way that is easy to abuse.If anything NLP as a whole goes strictly against the notion of selfdeprecation and making oneself the victim if only because its an intentional act of yielding to ones surroundings.,NLP,cv1c3l7,1,t5_2qqpg
8189181,0,t1_d50vjsq,When you do a NLP Practitioner course with a Licensed NLP Trainer you get a license. Only The Society of NLP of Richard Bandler works with licenses. In practice you dont need a license to learn NLP or use NLP. Nevertheless NLP is not public domain. A judge ruled that the copyrights belong to the Bandler group of people. Also you get a license to use the NLP Seal of Quality which is trade marked.In my many dealings with various NLP trainers though it becomes clear that it is very smart to study NLP with a Licensed NLP trainer or Licensed NLP Master Trainer. Not because they are always better training programmes than trainers without a license but in general the quality of the NLP training programme is a lot higher in the case of a Licensed NLP Trainer or Licensed NLP Master Trainer.,NLP,d5176jg,1,t5_2qqpg

11416478,0,t3_62t0mf,I consider it a school of thought and a set of models ways to think about things. There are a few models that are commonly thought of a this is NLP accessing cues pacingleading hypnosis etc.But it is not a single theory rather a growing set of ideas. So some work better than others. Some are true. Some are false. The best way to find out is to visit a course. Also get informed about WHO the people are so are offering courses in your area. There can be vast differences in quality. ,NLP,dfq1od9,1,t5_2qqpg
