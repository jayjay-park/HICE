2318271,0,t1_clvxrdv,Interesting. Good to see you are on the case with FAST I have done a bit of wake characterisation with lidar and comparison with wake models I had a poster and paper this year.I have also done bits and pieces of other lidar RampD but mostly commercial stuff.,wind,cly942a,1,t5_2qyr2

5927442,0,t3_3s685z,Weve definitely been moving a lot of windmill tower sections here in Texas. I drive past a wind farm yesterday that was bigger than Ive seen anywhere else. Iowa has some pretty massive farms too though.,wind,cxwmaex,1,t5_2qyr2
6417371,0,t3_43h56s,Topics to start you off withEconomic. Recent extension of the Production Tax Credit. The price of natural gas. Utilities attempting to bring more renewable energy production into their portfolios. Generally motivated by customer demand for renewablesSocial.  NIMBY opposition to offshore development New England. Pushback from communities founded on oil oftentimes in the same location think TXOK. Environmentalists attempting to protect migrating birds in certain areas,wind,czj39de,2,t5_2qyr2
10044225,0,t1_dbffpsj,I think we need to be able to produce a minimum of w with the minimum wind speed of  ms . i think the range of the speed of our location is  ms . yes it is not really practical just research purposes for new breakthrough in technology.ps  our school is not so advance in technology so we are trying to follow up on the latest trends  our latest trends are your oldest trends like  techs   we introduce them this innovation because it is very new to us . ,wind,dbgse0q,1,t5_2qyr2
10922297,0,t1_de6ddvk,It has a  meter diameter rotor which is longer than most land based wind turbines.  It gets very hard to transport blades that are as long as the ones on these turbines let along one that would be  larger. All in all a single  MW turbine would likely cost more to transport and install than these two combined.,wind,de6k4nm,2,t5_2qyr2
11433301,0,t1_dfrnp5f,To be honest adding more solar would likely be your best bet.  watts doesnt sound like a lot power but to have a rotor large enough to yield  watts at a reasonable wind speed will require somewhat substantial tower.  Also to get the turbine up into laminar smooth air flow you really want to be at least  feet above any obstructions within  feet. A tower that is strong enough to support the turbine and tall enough to get you up into good wind will likely be a huge pain to cart around with you. ,wind,dfrybi5,2,t5_2qyr2
11796067,0,t1_dgx2m6g,For some reason the article states a global energy consumption about  times less than the value Im seeing on wikipedia. Ill have to look into which one is correct but thats the source of the discrepancy.,wind,dgx4hj6,1,t5_2qyr2
