Some might even have small easter eggs like Kyubey or Cryaotics mask  its pretty cool! I still get excited every time you release a new update and see something familiar from the past thats new in store.I know its not really a question but basically keep up the good work! I cant wait to see whats coming up next.,HouseofJumpscares,cqnfqx7,1,t5_35r9k
