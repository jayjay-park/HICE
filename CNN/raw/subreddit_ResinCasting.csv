Im mainly casting dried plants and then macramaing them into pure awesome.There are some amazing resin artists on etsy for instance if you need some inspiration Im meaning enjoying their aesthetic and striving to form one for yourself not mimicking.Fun times!,ResinCasting,cj54byz,2,t5_2yqob

6847064,0,t1_d0sbze8,Im afraid PVC pipes dont normally come in that much variety. They are sold by InnerDiameter and after  ID the next size is  But if they did and you got OD and   ID then yeah thatd work. If you got OD and   OD they wouldnt even fit inside eachother like a telescope because the walls on that size pipe are thicker than .Also PVC isnt exactly the worlds greatest mold surface. Youd want to brush the mold throughout with a few coats of PVA mold barrier followed by a releaseagent. Take your time when unmolding stick to tools like wooden wedges.You wouldnt need to clamp the mold together. If anything that might deform it. Just tack everything down with hotglue.,ResinCasting,d0sf6ju,1,t5_2yqob

8357846,0,t3_4u272t,I have sometimes pinched the extremities while the resin is liquid to push out air and suck in resin. Hard if you have a block mould though. The vents were a good idea. You could also pour in small amounts of resin and manually slush it around all areas of the mold before filling it all the way up especially into the corners. Or even manually pushing the resin into the corners using a Popsicle stick or gloved fingers. ,ResinCasting,d5ma6s8,2,t5_2yqob

8644297,0,t1_d6m4hgi,Thanks! Yeah thats undoubtedly the next step. One thing that worries me is that Im supposed to fill half the mold wait for it to gel a bit place the stars and then close and fill the rest... Im afraid Im only adding chances of something going wrong. But well its not like there is much of an alternative so Ill have to be very careful and hope for the best ,ResinCasting,d6m5c7m,1,t5_2yqob

10715708,0,t3_5t6fkp,So if Im understanding you correctly you want to make a casting from a mold then unmold that casting and cut into that casting with like a saw or something you then want to polish that cut surface smooth and have the surface have a nice shiny metallic finish?Perhaps you should say a bit more about what youre trying to achieve because if Im following you there may be better ways to go about getting the endresult youre looking for.When you intrinsically mix metal powder into resin for the coldcast look it comes with some problems. If you add too little powder you get something that looks sorta like sparkly plastic and if the resin is lowviscosity you often get something thats blotchy because the heavy powder settles to the bottom before the resin sets up.But the more powder you add the higher the viscosity of the mixed substance. In the extremes it can turn into something sorta like cookiedough. The thicker your mixture is the harder it becomes to properly fill complex molds.When possible I like to use the technique where the metal powder is brushed on the surfaces of a silicone mold the excess is blown out with a bellows or lowpressure compressed air or whatever and then opaquetinted resin is gently poured in place. After pulling the casting you buff it very lightly with a microfiber cloth and you optionally spray it with a protective coat of clear spraypaint.Another technique to consider would be to use leafing. Leaving isnt that hard to learn and it potentially allows you to affordably use K gold if its the look you happen to be going for.As far as metal powders that look gold yeah the best you can do is a brass. You can buy metal powders that are either called gold or imitation gold that are a specific alloy of brass that tries best to have that yellowgold look. You can also tweak the tint by painting the surface with a translucent tinted clearcoat also known as a candycoat. Either way whenever working with brass powders to try and get a gold look you should either paint it with clear spray or be prepared to polish it once in awhile because it does tarnishpatina when exposed to the air.So yeah whatcha making?,ResinCasting,ddl8uxs,3,t5_2yqob
11368606,0,t3_622xup,I was interested in getting into tap handles. Are you pinning the mold for the attachment drilling it out or just inserting the attachment into the mold? ,ResinCasting,dfklyba,1,t5_2yqob
