68910,0,t3_1uw7jr,I got the game in a Humble Bundle a couple weeks ago and finally started playing yesterday. Works great with my X arcade stick. My only issue with the game is the ship speeds. Maybe Ill unlock some faster ships later but it feels so slow to me. It is an excellent game though. Highly recommend it to anyone with a PC and a better way to control it than a keyboard.I have had no issues running the game. It looks beautiful and never drops frames for me.,shmups,cem9w7y,2,t5_2r4cd
369739,0,t3_1xrwpg,I only played the imported Dreamcast version years ago but is it just me or does the game seem a bit slower than the Dreamcast version?  Then again there are other factors why my eyes are playing tricks such as crt vs lcd.,shmups,cfj37kb,1,t5_2r4cd

And unfortunately the only legal way to obtain it currently is by purchasing the physical edition from one of the very few stores that carry it.It went on an indiegala sale once but aside from that its never been made available digitally.,shmups,cv6kppi,0,t5_2r4cd

5391188,0,t3_3onsi7,Its too early to provide any meaningful feedback. The system you have outlined could work great or it could be terrible. It will depend on your talent commitment and labor. Once you have a semifunctional build or some visuals that give an accurate representation only then will we be able to give you useful feedback.,shmups,cw0s9ku,1,t5_2r4cd
7501433,0,t3_4hjr70,bit Axelay for its amazing cinematic score that elevates the mood of the game Thunderforce IV for being the second best sounding game on the Genesis we all know whats first.bit GDarius for its incredible avantgarde soundtrack that really pulls you into the alien worlds of the game and Einhander for really nailing that mid s techno. Einhander gets bonus points because the opening theme is clearly influenced by Ghost in the Shell.,shmups,d2uvh1u,1,t5_2r4cd

9770414,0,t3_5f361u,The LS is great for shmups but also a very good allrounder. A lot of people who play fighting games use it. Its very much like the sanwa JLF favoured by a lot of fighting game folk but with less throw and a tighter spring.Id go with sanwa buttons if youre going to be playing fighting games as theyre a lot more sensitive.Youd have a stick that was great for both genres if you went with that I think.,shmups,dahf45e,2,t5_2r4cd
9951728,0,t1_db1tol2,Be warned that if you game on something with integrated video and dedicated video fair odds Reflex will not work right at all.  It has some direct draw bugs that they dont care to fix.Neat gameideas.  Shame mine doesnt work.,shmups,db4qi3c,2,t5_2r4cd

11701749,0,t3_66yf3w,This is a Link to a thread with a guide called The Full Extent of the Jam which has some really solid techniques and tips about playing shmups. I agree with the others just play at whatever lvl you enjoy. I do think if you want to get really serious about them the guide above will help you maximize how you practice them.,shmups,dgmeual,9,t5_2r4cd
