554569,0,t3_20hl1j,Yurbuds they never fall out I dont feel them on my ears and they arent very expensive. The sound quality is mediocre but they have higher end models that I assume sound good ,runningmusic,cg3b7o0,10,t5_2tr7w
556313,0,t1_cg3ht63,Eh.  When youre talking about fantastic sound you really start raising the bar.  Shure is not known for that especially in the sub category.  Rolled off highs the dynamic drivers end up with muddy bass that can distort music at times.  They are not bad headphones by any means but they have a lot of competition at that price point.,runningmusic,cg3icch,2,t5_2tr7w
1435257,0,t1_civhclr,Yes I agree. If you dont need pumping songs this kind is the best to run and have few relaxing kilometers  miles. Do you have anything you could recommend?,runningmusic,ciw6pkx,1,t5_2tr7w

11122375,0,t1_de4mg8i,Im late to to the thread but this is exactly right.Ive got a cheap pair of Bluetooth earbuds from Amazon mpow antelopes.  With the stock siliconeish buds they are kind of meh.  With comply tips they are perfectly adequate.  They stay secure and the sound quality is not horrible even if it doesnt match my big over ear working headphones.So yeah good tips can count for a lot.,runningmusic,despnb5,2,t5_2tr7w
