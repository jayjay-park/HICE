334471,0,t1_cffff0r,gtNutritionally absolutely nothing in a daily diet can beat the benefits of natural foods. Especially nothing made in a lab and there is no fallacy about that. Even if that is true what does it have to do with aspartame being safe or not?  I did not say it was nutritious.I brought out the naturalistic fallacy because your comment seemed to directly depend on it.  You said that you had a hard time believing anything artificial could be so safe.,vegetarianketo,cfffsbz,1,t5_2st2u

1408952,0,t3_2a8855,gtIve started lowering my carbs to  ready to go fully keto when i get paid tomorrow.Good start but youll need to start approaching  a day. The first phase of keto is getting yourself familiar with nutritional facts. So for awhile try and get into the habit of checking the nutritional content on absolutely everything that youre trying to eat as well as being aware of the serving sizes. But as a general rule if its sweet or starchy its off the list. There are of course exceptions but you want things that are fatty rich and protein moderate and carb light. Things that fall into this category just by nature are eggs and cheese and nuts. You can cook veggies in some oil to add fat content to those types of meals too so most veggies are on the menu. Go easy on carrots and tomatoes because theyre carbier than other veggies. Fruits are pretty much off the list. So yeah! Start reading nutrition facts on the back of products and for everything without a nutritional content label produce and bulk things give it a google! And good luck! Edit Also this grocery list kicks ass ,vegetarianketo,cisw3zp,1,t5_2st2u

Easy. Hard boil eggs for a lot of uses. Tempeh is a pretty easy low carb soy product that you can cut up and cook on the stove for a protein. Make broccoli cheese soup in the crock pot mix and wait!. There are tofu products already baked just eat cold or heat up however. Salads with ranch or oily dressings. Almost my whole diet is easy veg food.

7709303,0,t3_4ktmvd,Check your electrolytes and give it a little time.  Your body is still adapting to using fat for fuel and I remember feeling that way often.  Maybe check out rketogains as well for other things you can do.  . Meal plan!  If I didnt do that isId  eat eggs and cheese all day long.  Try frittata black soy beans for Mexican dishes  egg salad  halumifrying cheese  and fake meats to round it out Morningstar sausage and tjs meatballs are my fave.  I prep a bunch in the weekends for anything that needs baking check out cheese Danishes on up late anyway.  Ill link back if I can after the baby is down.
