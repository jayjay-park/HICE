6349511,0,t3_42manq,I just finished reading Dylanologists by David Kinney... Its essentially exploring the different kinds of fans Dylan has and giving examples to show the different extremes people go to in their Dylan fandom. I gotta say I love the man and probably to an unhealthy amount but some of these people go to such extremes... its not hard to see at all why Dylan would hate fans. But sometimes it seems like he is almost playing with us. Like the Weberman interview that is on CDLP  if Dylan hates Weberman so much why submit to the interview and why taunt him? Man Im gonna do an article on you man. I think Im gonna write a song about you too... its called Pig. I think its all a game to Dylan... Thats where I am at this point.

6952441,0,t3_4aw8dr,I am biased because Girl from the North Country was the first dylan song that got me hooked. I had heard blown in the wind and those before but it was years later with North Country that i knew i was in for the long run. I was in Australia for half a year with a couple of friends after we ended senior high school. Me and one of my friendsthe girl i was in love with always took walks by the beach talking and listening to music before going to bed. She was a dylan fan and the first song she showed me was North Country. I liked the theme and sense of longing in the song it felt timeless to me then. I think i hyped it even more because i wanted to impress her of course. So the setting both around me and the feelings i had that we were never going to be together because i was to afraid to say anything to her about it has mad this song the one i have most affection for. Its not his best song i my opinion but its up there.That said i agree that the storytelling of Boots of Spanish Leather is better. For delivery i find myself listening to the Bootleg Series  version for abit slower tempo and for what i feel more emotion.

I hadnt heard all of his music at that point so I didnt know exactly what to expect but I certainly heard some of his s stuff so I knew his voice wouldnt sound like  or .Ive seen him  times total now and its lost its luster a bit but those first  times the other was fall  were magical. I for one appreciate the different arrangements I think its cool he doesnt just go through the motions but he keeps reinventing his sound.

Darkness at the break of noon     Shadows even the silver spoon     The handmade blade the childs balloon     Eclipses both the sun and moon     To understand you know too soon     There is no sense in trying          Pointed threats they bluff with scorn     Suicide remarks are torn     From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn     Plays wasted words proves to warn     That he not busy being born is busy dying          Temptations page flies out the door     You follow find yourself at war     Watch waterfalls of pity roar     You feel to moan but unlike before     You discover that youd just be one more     Person crying          So dont fear if you hear     A foreign sound to your ear     Its alright Ma Im only sighing          As some warn victory some downfall     Private reasons great or small     Can be seen in the eyes of those that call     To make all that should be killed to crawl     While others say dont hate nothing at all     Except hatred          Disillusioned words like bullets bark     As human gods aim for their mark     Make everything from toy guns that spark     To fleshcolored Christs that glow in the dark     Its easy to see without looking too far     That not much is really sacred          While preachers preach of evil fates     Teachers teach that knowledge waits     Can lead to hundreddollar plates     Goodness hides behind its gates     But even the president of the United States     Sometimes must have to stand naked          An though the rules of the road have been lodged     Its only peoples games that you got to dodge     And its alright Ma I can make it          Advertising signs they con     You into thinking youre the one     That can do whats never been done     That can win whats never been won     Meantime life outside goes on     All around you          You lose yourself you reappear     You suddenly find you got nothing to fear     Alone you stand with nobody near     When a trembling distant voice unclear     Startles your sleeping ears to hear     That somebody thinks they really found you          A question in your nerves is lit     Yet you know there is no answer fit     To satisfy insure you not to quit     To keep it in your mind and not forget     That it is not he or she or them or it     That you belong to          Although the masters make the rules     For the wise men and the fools     I got nothing Ma to live up to          For them that must obey authority     That they do not respect in any degree     Who despise their jobs their destinies     Speak jealously of them that are free     Cultivate their flowers to be     Nothing more than something they invest in          While some on principles baptized     To strict party platform ties     Social clubs in drag disguise     Outsiders they can freely criticize     Tell nothing except who to idolize     And then say God bless him          While one who sings with his tongue on fire     Gargles in the rat race choir     Bent out of shape from societys pliers     Cares not to come up any higher     But rather get you down in the hole     That hes in          But I mean no harm nor put fault     On anyone that lives in a vault     But its alright Ma if I cant please him          Old lady judges watch people in pairs     Limited in sex they dare     To push fake morals insult and stare     While money doesnt talk it swears     Obscenity who really cares     Propaganda all is phony          While them that defend what they cannot see     With a killers pride security     It blows the minds most bitterly     For them that think deaths honesty     Wont fall upon them naturally     Life sometimes must get lonely          My eyes collide headon with stuffed     Graveyards false gods I scuff     At pettiness which plays so rough     Walk upsidedown inside handcuffs     Kick my legs to crash it off     Say okay I have had enough what else can you show me?

10998152,0,t3_5wwef0,For the longest time I actively detested Dylan covers I would avoid the things like I owed them money. The usual process involved in their creationsmoothing out the edges to create a more commercial soundhas always struck me as deeply cynical. That and Ive just never thought any of them sounded all that good certainly not good enough to prioritize them over the originals.Over time though Ive come to be grateful for the endless interpretations that abound because theyve allowed me to get a better understanding of what drew me to Dylans music in the first place. That is to say the sum total of every shitty cover forced me into an internal reckoning of sorts where I had to drill down deep into the darker recesses of my mind to try to fish out what was really going on. I had to ask myself how is it possible that every single cover leaves me cold? I knew it wasnt just a matter of me resenting alterations to some specific sound that I revered because the faithful arrangements annoyed me as completely as the radical departures. Similarly since no ones silly enough to mess with the product of Dylans pen in any major way I could safely rule out any perceived lyrical tomfoolery as the cause of my bother. So again I said to myself what is going on? What is the damn difference?Then it hit me its the humanity. Dylan coverswith very few exceptionshollow out the humanity in their quest for perfection. I dont think its necessarily intentional I actually think it might be unavoidable. Bob inhabits the characters in his songs so thoroughly that when you take him out of the equation the material is deprived of the energy it needs to propel itself forward. Its this energizing forcemore than his words or his soundthat makes his versions definitive by definition. Its not just that Bob is at the centre of his songs its that hes the axis around which they spin.The most any other artist can hope to do when covering a Dylan song is to approximate the Dylan experience they cannot truly replicate it. Because they can only tell the stories in the songs they cant live them. Only Bob is free to live out the stories because they are his stories in every essential way. Hes as much his songs as they are him.So anyway....I still cant stand  of Dylan covers but I dont avoid them like I used to. Nowadays I even seek them out on occasionany time I want to increase my appreciation for the originals.,bobdylan,deelv4f,8,t5_2qi0m

11121665,0,t1_des1t87,An Older person here..... I find it so cheering to read about you young people being so into Bob. Its really encouraging for the future. ive been listening to Bob since  first saw him live on February   still have my ticket stub. Levon had already left the show because he couldnt stand the boos in Europe. There were boos that first night I saw him when Bob returned for his second set electric. Still seeing Bob in concert to this day. I have to say that I am the only one of my friends who continues to see Bob live. Regardless of how time has changed him and his renditions of his songs and his voice it means a great deal to me to see him on stage live. He has been a huge part of my life and we have gotten old together. ,bobdylan,desmr1p,5,t5_2qi0m
11143458,0,t1_deuke4d,Thats exactly how I feel about it as well.One key thing that Bob has going for him is the long game. Hes studied in schools. There are classes about him at a major university or two. Hes deeply connected to the scholars and that will likely continue. So somebody that outsold him say the Rolling Stones wont necessarily be referenced and discussed as much as Bob might be in  years. His music is so timeless and revolutionary all at once. I strongly believe his legacy will stretch so far due to his content. ,bobdylan,dev3l5w,3,t5_2qi0m
