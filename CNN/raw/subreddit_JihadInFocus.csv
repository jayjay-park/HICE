6350932,0,t1_czbdsi0,The data is released by stopdjihadisme either via a politician directly e.g. Cazeneuve Valls or given to the media. France has this odd way of releasing some official data via the media rather than directly to everyone. So when journalists quote data it is from this platform although they quote who gave them the data personally the ministry a civil servant etc...For example  Here Seelow the journalist wrote at the third paragraphs beginning According to the latest data which Le Monde has been able to see .... This is because Le Monde was chosen to release the data exclusively not the government itself. The government will change the media outlet every time for the exclusivity to change hands. For example the last info was given to France Info  Do not ask why they proceed this way. I do not know and it is quite irritating.About my conclusion The point I was making in the first comment is that this data is unreliable. They give general tends not statistical evidence.In the second comment I point out the stopdjihadisme platform how it collects data and the issues with firstly how it considers cases as radicalised and secondly parentsrelatives that do not report cases to the authorities.In the third comment I detailed how the data is release and not available on demand and mentioned the possibility of a crosscheck with intelligence services. Now you are asking how can I conclude that these numbers strictly come from stopdjihadisme? What do you mean by come from?  Do you mean come from in the sense of who releases the data? One of the purposes of stopdjihadisme is to be the platform that releases the data. I also can conclude this because I personally interviewed the head of the CIPD Comit Interministriel de Prvention de la Dlinquance   which is in charge of radicalisation prevention amongst other missions. The CIPD is part of the Ministry of the Interior. I have also spoken to two members of the AlpesMaritime prfecture the head office of a dpartement who collaborated the information. Do you mean come from in the sense of how the data is collected by stopdjihadisme? One of the purposes of stopdjihadisme is to be the platform that collects and compiles all this data. The main sources are parentsrelatives because intelligence services cannot track everybody. It is impossible  they do not have the resources nor the capabilities because they lack resources. Further I have also spoken to numerous NGOs in the AlpesMaritime who said that the stopdjihadisme info was wrong in their dpartement. They claimed this because parentsrelatives did not report the cases. Had the intelligence services been more involved the officials numbers would reflect the NGO numbers.Does the data come purely from stopdjihadisme? The sharing of it yes. The compiling yes at least to the public. The collection for the greatest majority. This links back to my first comment the data is unreliable because of the way it is collected.Does this clear it up? ,JihadInFocus,czbj3xi,2,t5_3b5ej

6901524,0,t1_d0ybn7i,Bear in mind that theres TONS of small villages in Anbar they could move piecemeal they could wait for nightfall and move with regular civilian traffic not to IR and thermal couldnt still see them they could dismantle the guns throw a tarp over them load heavy vehicles on a flatbed and tarp them etc etc. The same way they move equipment all over Syria and Iraq for attacks or defensives one would assume will be how they move when abandoning an area. This is a constant issue for them and they certainly will continue to have to struggle with it but their entire fleet of technicals and heavy weaponry hasnt gotten destroyed even in more built up areas with a lot heavier droneaircraft presence Rutbah is in the middle of nowhere and next to no majorsignificant cities.Our drone capabilities are legit as are our satellite aircraft and other intelligence collection platforms.

7688814,0,t1_d3g4sml,I think youve got it all wrong. It was the debaathification of Iraq coupled with the unjust practices from that propped up Safavid regime that fuelled the Sunni separatism you see in ISIS.Sunnis that formerly had held jobs in the military and the public sector lost their pensions jobs everything in the so called democratic process the U.S initiated. Their example is like the story of the wolf that saw a newborn lamb. So it said to the lamb You were the one who dirtied my water last year! The lamb replied It was not me. It WAS you the wolf insisted. So the lamb told him Well I was born this year! The wolf said So it must have been your mother! and ate the lamb. And what could the poor mother do when she saw her son being torn into pieces between the teeth of the wolf? But in the passion of the motherhood she butted the wolf. Of course the wolf was not affected at all however it shouted out Look at this terrorist! So these parrots joined in. Repeating what the wolf said and saying Yes we condemn the ewes butt against the wolf.,JihadInFocus,d3g63uk,0,t5_3b5ej

The US has never aided what they previously considered a terrorist organization especially one that has repeatedly called out for their destruction. In fact the aiding of the rebels has always been in the Gulf and Turkeys interests over the US and should the rebels lose it wouldnt phase the US as much as you would think.,JihadInFocus,d5uwqpl,2,t5_3b5ej

9304557,0,t1_d8vdgyc,Thank you for the well thought out response. I do agree the Iraqi army will really play this up as they attempt to use every bit of ground they gain as a massive victory. Im not sure what Isis numbers are in Mosul but I expect them to have at least k men. They appear to be doing their usual tactics these days. Get VIPs and families out of the city while still trying to put on a show to the citizens that everything is normal and they are in charge still. I also wonder what kind of cells the Iraqi army has in the city prepared to act from within. How long do you think this fight will last? Id expect a few months before the Iraqis can clear a city of this size maybe longer if Isis has more men. It is a beautiful city. But I expect it to be in very bad shape by the end. Isis will likely have IEDs everywhere and the army with its artillery and air strikes will likely make major destruction. Lets both hope that children and other civilians come out of this unharmed. ,JihadInFocus,d8vf4jb,1,t5_3b5ej

10545183,0,t1_dd3eei9,The compound was behind a mosque. And as we often saw in Afghanistan and other places the fighters would have their families and affiliated families with them inside their compound. Including women and children obviously. Some of the civilians were injured by the initial missile impact while others were killed seemingly in the fire exchange between the al Qaeda affiliated militia and the assaulting SOCOM unit members. A good top down description of the problematic nature of attacking a compound with civilians in it can be found in Ghost Wars by Steve Coll. It details the difficulty that President Clinton had when he received intelligence on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden inside a compound in Afghanistan. The compound contained OBL a couple of bodyguards a couple of drivers and misc. other OBL affiliated staff. Inside the compound was also the families of the supporting staff. All in all if memory serves  civilians were inside the compound. Including children. President Clinton considered the options of a drone strike an early one it would have been one of the very first uses of an armed drone  and the CIA were the originating customer for these drones an armed assault on the compound by Uzbeki Special Forces as well as a aerial bombing raid on the perimeter. In the end the President opted for requesting additional intelligence and that before he would send a drone to strike against the compound he would have to have eye confirmation from a US source. In large part of this the book says was that the President had been told that there would be a two digit large presence of civilians inside the compound that would with a large probability have perished if a drone or bombing strike had been ordered.The US SFSOFDoDCIA were not able nor wholly willing to send in a member of their teams to put eyes on the target and possibly paint the target when OBL was visible. Too high risk. So the notion of striking the compound was neglected. For a while they investigated the notion of having regional Special Forces operators that were being trained by the US Government US DoD and CIA in bordering nations go in dressed like locals and attack the OBL convoy when it was traveling through a particular pass. In the end that option was never utilized however. Remember this predates the  and subsequent events. It is not relatively speaking hard to net a high collateral number when attacking a compound with dubious inside intelligence and where a ground assault takes places and with a resulting extended  minutes! fire exchange takes place. ,JihadInFocus,dd3ex5m,1,t5_3b5ej
