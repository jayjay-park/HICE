I also hate it goes straight to your bank account and takes like a month to get there. The sweet spot is like  for TCG over Ebay. Since they take a . off the top for every transaction.,cardsphere,dbnvggr,4,t5_3g453

10933775,0,t3_5w4s10,I think policy in general should be much more laissezfaire than elsewhere. No convoluted and contrived sets of incentives and restrictions meant to shape user behavior  the markets should be able to sort themselves out on a lot of issues provided that there arent unnecessary rigidities eg. price ceilingfloors difficulty of moving money etc.This comes up because there were some policies that I guess we had planned that I wasnt aware of for the Fast Finance interview  that we were going to set up barriers to cashing out or whatever. Thats dangerous when being able to cash out easily should be a frontandcenter feature of the site imo. Ive seen the what if someone fulfills a bunch of wants and cashes out and then no one has currency to have wants displayed anymore concern raised a couple times but imo this should not actually be seen as a problem and if it is it signals to me that something else is wrong  if people get their wants filled theyll be happy and buy more currency... right?Also in general consistency and transparency are very important values when it comes to policy execution. Deckbox frustrates me sometimes because a lot of the policies are ad hoc and enforced at the whims of the one administrator. On the other hand on PucaTrade you have clearer explicit policies but a lot of inconsistency in how theyre enforced between different admins. In general discretion is valuable but a lot of these things eg. arbitrarily pushing back dispute deadlines are simply frustrating.Oh and also the sending timeframe should be operationalized in business days not hours. PucaTrades h rule is stupid  its not that h is too short but it should account for weekends and times when mailing isnt feasible.Im sure I could think of lots of morespecific points if properly prompted.,cardsphere,de7qq1t,5,t5_3g453

11162703,0,t1_de9kvak,Okay... sorry to reply to such an old comment but I read the comments here and on this podcast and I had to vent a bit.Let me start by saying you are doing the right thing. Startups typically fail because they lack productmarket fit not because they dont have a gotomarket plan. Ive cofounded two startups myself one was acquired and one failed and was wound down. The main difference was that the first company found productmarket fit quickly and the second company never could.You already know your market well. Not only are you members of it yourself but you have a good understanding of channels that you can use to communicate with potential users. You have an eager group of people actively testing your product and are ready to make a financial commitment to it once it is productionready. You even have a competitor with an unhappy userbase from whom you can siphon mindshare and users. You are primed for success.So theoretically your market is welldefined and wellunderstood so what you need to do is build a product to serve that market. Youre doing it in exactly the right way creating just enough software to solve the problem and doing so interactively with members of your target market.Please please continue doing what youre doing. Its great to accept feedback on what you might do as a business but dont let it distract you from the course that youre on. There will be a point where you might need a marketing strategy but thats useless without a wellengineered product that serves a wellunderstood and accessible market.One of the side effects of startups becoming mainstream is that now everyone feels like because saw the Social Network or an episode of Silicon Valley or because they took a job at a startup once that they understand what startups are all about. Thats like deciding that youre qualified to be a professional political operative because you watched a couple seasons of The West Wing. You dont need to build a startup. In reality the word startup has very little meaning. All you need to worry about is building a product that solves a real problem for real people and youre doing exactly that.
