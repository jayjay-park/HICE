On the outside is our property distribution form filled out with all the info but the users name.  We place these in a std file cabinet.  It works well for us since most requests are last minute and this allows a grab n go system.,ITdept,ceonarm,2,t5_2stme

150361,0,t3_1vszz5,Be patient and friendly to your users.  Some will not learn you will just have to go in with a smile and try your best to get them to learn.  As for the technical side.  If youre going into an enterprise environment brush up on some Active Directory Exchange and some scripting batchpowershell.  Also try to make friends with as many IT people as possible.  Friends in the IT field are a great resource!,ITdept,cevk2an,4,t5_2stme

2254956,0,t3_2l0wc3,Storage is all about readwrite speed and less about RAM and CPU. If you are just storing data you need large capacity with redundancy more than speed. You want at least two drives in RAID . Speed is dependent on the hard drives inputoutput speed readwrite speed buffer size and platter speed. Also your network speed will also have a large impact.

3553573,0,t3_30xk8r,From the sounds of things you are using a pop connection. You need. To switch to Imap although Outlook  kind of sucks at it. Id suggest trying thisFind out if your email hosting company offers imap connections and get the connection info. Install Thunderbird getThunderbird. Com on both machines and setup imap connections to the email account. Create a folder with each of your names under the inbox. When an email comes in whoever will handle it drags to their folder then replies out of there. If it is in the inbox it is still fair game. Since it is imap everything will sync. Readunread status replies sent folders etc will all automatically mirror each other on both computers. If one person moves the email to their folder the same thing will happen on the other computer. It isnt a perfect system but it should be free and easy to try out. You might have to come up with your own system of signaling maybe a handled folder that replied to requests are dragged to etc but it should work. It also makes it easier if someone is out sick because you can see all of the other persons replies without having to use their computer. ,ITdept,cpxbxa4,1,t5_2stme
3653392,0,t3_327f1s,It all depends.  IT Tech is a very broad term.  I wouldnt expect a SA to be making an exorbitant amount.  The SE or architects make the money.A sysadmin is using the tools given to cobble together whatever possible to keep the lights on.  In smaller companies your title will be sysadmin youll end up doing the work of an engineer and an admin and be paid like an admin k max.As you look to slightly larger companies the world of engineering opens up.  These are they guys who program out everything design more efficient systems and execute the vision of the architect.  Making the systems that the admins use.  Going rate in my areak depending on the size of the company their success and your skillset.If your company is big enough youll have an architect or a few.  I dont know what they make because I havent gone up that road just yet.  Im halfway to  I like engineering.So define what you mean by technician.  IT is an albatross of a term.,ITdept,cq8poa3,3,t5_2stme

Check out rsysadmin to get a general idea of the kind of work sysadmins do.You dont need a degree  many sysadmins are selftaught andor industry certs they take study. But of those who are selftaught almost all of them worked their way up to sysadmin  usually through helpdesk DCmonkey desktop tech etc and all of those jobs suck.Also theres an increasing expectation that sysadmins know how to script  so youll want to look into that PowerShell for Windows Bash for Linux in addition to PythonPerlPHPRubyJavscript for eitherboth.,ITdept,deeluz1,5,t5_2stme
