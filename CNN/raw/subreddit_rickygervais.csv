714519,0,t1_cglg2rt,I agree that he isnt really funny. I think his stand up is terrible and he comes across as very big headed nowadays on twitter.Although I do think him and merchant as a pair can make very relatable comedy extras is my favourite. I dont ever really laugh out loud at any of the sitcoms but they always make me grin because they truly are situation comedies the perfectionist style writing they did together I think makes characters evolving personalities and relationships feel very real.I think rickys acting is never believable enough for me except in extras because Andy is based off of Gervaiss life. When I see Derek all I see is gervais doing an impression like he does on XFM and the podcasts.Its a shame they dont write together now I dont know why Lifes Too Short never appealed to me or anyone else.,rickygervais,cglht2q,2,t5_2rlm2

1618574,0,t3_2cshvh,It seems like people have really turned on Gervais in recent years which is a shame.I dont think hes doing it for money or fame or whatever... I certainly dont think hes setting out to destroy The Office legacy.  I really believe he loves the character and feels he can make an excellent standalone David Brent film.I dont think Ill be able to bring myself to watch it though.  The Office ended perfectly and I really have no desire to revisit any of those characters because I do feel like it would tarnish my memories of them.  Too much time has passed and it seems like sequels that occur several years later rarely reach the same level as the original.  And if Stephen Merchant isnt involved that just adds another reason why I want my last memory of The Office to be David Brent finally standing up to Finchy and possibly for the first time actually being happy.I still like Ricky Gervais a lot and Ill look forward to any future stand up shows or possible collaborations with Steve and Karl but for me David Brents story finished with The Christmas Special in .,rickygervais,cjj6rja,16,t5_2rlm2

2183753,0,t3_2jwhdr,Well they frequently reference the list in the radio shows. I think this was a list of topics theyre going to discuss because of the criticisms that they receive about the show not being structured enough. The podcasts are definitely more scripted. They realised that the majority of the listeners for them had never heard the XFM shows so they obviously had to repeat popular stories that were said on the show. The one that springs to mind is the story about Karl showing his arse to the naked lady across the street. This was mentioned at the end of XFM Series  I think but then it springs up again the podcasts presumably a few years later Steve and Ricky pretty much act as if its the first time theyve heard it which is hard to believe considering how ridiculous the story is.,rickygervais,clhep5w,1,t5_2rlm2

9520830,0,t1_d9ml6yw,Sometimes its a bit much. But the worst is when Ricky  on several occasions  calls Karl retarded. I think thats completely out of line especially given the context and content of the show. And even if Rickys joking considering how he can behave squawking shouting dressing grown adults up and tormenting them his behaviour on The Office extra bitsmaking of that Steve films. Ricky would say hes only joking or doing it for comedy but Im pretty sure thats why Karl says the things he does too.,rickygervais,d9mn7om,2,t5_2rlm2
