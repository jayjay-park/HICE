3135326,0,t3_2vwaaj,I dont think that the real problem is beers vs. cocktails.The real problem is people sitting at the bar vs. everyone else.  Bars are designed so poorly.  Theyre surrounded by chairsstools which is fine if you get to sit at one.  When a place is crowded and you arent sitting at the bar you have to elbow in between people that are sitting there and then wave money around like youre guiding in a  to land.  In the meantime the bartender is at the other end of the bar taking care of the  people down there who also need a beverage at the same exact time.If youre going to have bar seating you should have a dedicated bartender for it.  Then you have a line at one end for other patrons that need drinks and you have a dedicated bartender for that.Lets get on top of this shit.,highsocietyradio,comz1yk,2,t5_2zxh7
