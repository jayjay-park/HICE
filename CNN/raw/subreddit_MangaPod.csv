4797098,0,t3_3ey3gq,Cromartie High School  Folks meet Takashi Kamiyama. Enrolled at Cromartie High where everybody is a delinquent Kamiyama is apparently the only nondelinquent in the school. Logically therefore he must be the toughest in his classby the rather twisted logic that only a really tough rabbit would lie down with lions. Thus begins a story that parodies every clich of toughguy anime that youve ever heard of and some you havent. Oh and Freddie Mercury is in it too.,MangaPod,ctz7oj9,1,t5_2winr
