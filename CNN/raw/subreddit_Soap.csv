1658082,0,t1_cjo45fu,For our purposes of soap making we have to look at the properties of triglycerides which are three fatty acids joined together by a glycerol molecule.Fatty acids and triglycerides have the property of being nonpolar. This is because the charge of their atomic structure is well balanced. The oils on our skin and clothes are also nonpolar as are all oils. Water is very polar and since that is our common solvent we need a way to broach the gap and that is where soap and detergent comes in.We use a strong base OH to cleave the bonds of the glycerol and insert a polar end onto the triglyceride which makes one end attracted to nonpolar molecules and the other hydrophilic means it is attracted to water and we have bridged the gap! The reaction happens because some atoms have a much stronger charge than others and will pull apart molecules think of them as magnets with different strengths.Different molecules have different weights and we count them up by using a number we call a mol. A mol is a number like a pair  a dozen  or a gross . A mol is around . but it is a term for a number of units. We know how much each atom weighs and if we weigh a bunch of atoms we can find out how many we have. I havent balanced this equation so please dont use these numbers just use soapcalc. I will make this simple.A reaction will use  mol of Lye NaOH which we know weighs . grams to react with one mole of our fatty acidIll use stearic as an example which weighs . grams per mol. So if I were reacting  grams of stearic I would use about  grams actually a bit less for safety of lye. The lye discount or superfat is what we call using a bit less lye for safety.So that is a rough overview of the process from a chemistry point of view. I have to go right now but I can come back later if you would like. Good luck!,Soap,cjo5x69,2,t5_2sv7l
