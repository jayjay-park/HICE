However my take on this is that the reactions in ones brain do not influence your decisions but rather give rise to your ability to make decisions.  That is actually correct yes.the opposing view that just because our brains and bodies are biological and chemical processes  it means free will is an illusion  is a nonsensical assertion arguing for one of the two binary extremes. Neither of which is actually absolutely true.So even of we have ability to think freely that is working on that same biology and chemistry  it does not mean we have the same amount of free will at any time. As i said the only real answer is Sometimes more sometimes less. It depends.It is a tongue in cheek kind of answer but it does correctly point out that free will is not any kind of static predetermined set amount of anything.It differs from person to person day to day situation to situation. I think i got the really good explanation of what consciousness is but i got a bit stuck in trying to write it all down into something acceptable to the public.If i manage to talk myself into finishing it this is one of the places where it will be published.,Meanpath,d3f513b,1,t5_3efo1
