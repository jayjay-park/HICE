10461142,0,t1_dctv4or,Its a Wein MRB ZincAir Battery. Its identical to the battery that is needed but not mercury obviously theyre no longer made. It maintains the . volts that are needed for its entire lifespan unlike an alkaline or silver battery. I think I paid roughly  USD plus shipping for a couple from BampH Photo. ,Cameraporn,dctvkne,1,t5_2sgqu
