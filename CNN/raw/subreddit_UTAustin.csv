434588,0,t1_cfps268,Just because the Civil Rights Movement addressed far more serious and sensitive issues does not mean that the same logic mentioned in these quotes cannot be applied elsewhere. That we should not change the injustices of the present simply because of its comparison to the past is a fallacy. The messages behind what these leaders said should be listened to. People seem to downplay the injustices that people who use marijuana encounter. Do you know what its like to have an arrest record in the professional world? Do you know how many people have been killed over just a plant? These drug laws ruin peoples lives and some of us arent content to just sit back while that happens.   Another fallacy that seems to pop up is that there are way more important things the country should be focused on. The problem there being that just because we are actively trying to change this particular policy doesnt mean that the country does not have the time and resources to devote to other important issues. How do you think the Civil Rights Movement actually got those amendments to be instituted? The people didnt back down even though the attitude of much of the south was that the people should just stay in their place. Follow the rules. Submit. So people need to keep talking about this even though it can get kind of annoying. But until its safe to say that people are no longer being harmed by drug policy keep fighting.   Also Drug laws in general are targeted at minorities effectively killing some of the freedoms gained by the movement. Black people in the US are part of a new system of slavery the prison system. There are so many implications behind legalization and its frustrating and offensive when people dumb it down by saying people just want to get their high.

See the other posts in this thread for example many of them complain because the class was too hard and they just wanted to take it as a GPA booster.Tuttle himself is very smart and in the other MIS classes he teaches he has to buckle down and be a lot more technically indepth. For his foundations class he gets a lot more fun flashy and high level to not scare off the nontechies.

So far no concealed carriers have been shot by police nor have the situations been made worse by their presence.A very similar question was asked by the senators during committee testimony and one of the sheriffs said that when they have happened upon a situation of an aggressor and an armed CHL good guy the person with the CHL was always very compliant put the weapon down when the police showed up and was as nonthreatening as possible.

4846797,0,t3_3h96m3,Im an ECECS dual entering my third year now.ECE and CS do approach programming in different ways. ECE does bottom up and CS is top down. CS definitely gets started with programming faster but either degree appears the same to companies looking for software engineers. The main reason to do both is for the added practiceexperience or if you are interested in certain CSonly topics AI game dev etc.Unfortunately CS isnt really accepting transfersdouble majors for the foreseeable future. This is because of several issues between the departments and also because of limitations on the CS department. If you still want to try Id suggest starting by talking to the CS department advisors. To get a contact try walking into the advising office and just swiping a card to email an advisor as sometimes the people manning the desk turn people down.As a side note Id suggest joining the ECE Facebook and CS Facebook pages. This has been discussed a few times on both pages use the search bar and you should be able to dig some discussions up. If you have more questions feel free to send me a message. Alternatively you can find me around at the robotics club at UT RAS.Lastly its always worth it to join a club  as a student you can still join CS orgs if you want so find one that interests you.,UTAustin,cu5h3wl,11,t5_2qy08

5034805,0,t3_3jwe35,Hi pikabuddy! Im glad you posted the other orgs youre interested in because while I cant give you info on AT I can tell you about APO to give a sort of comparison to the things you mentioned being worried about.APO is a huge organization  actives but we are divided up into groups called families so that you can find the people you click with. I joined just last spring when I was a junior so dont be afraid that only freshmen will be joining either. We get a lot of transfer students from places like UT dallas.APO doesnt allow alcohol at any official APO event including service projects and social events. While there are ice cream socials that many members set up and attend there are plenty of very active brothers who dont drink at all. APO isnt technically dry as per our bylaws but we may as well be. APO dues are high your first semester around  but get lower your active semesters to about . My personal experience One of the negatives about APO is that its sometimes difficult to make a real connection and find a group of friends because the organization is just so big. Personally I found it took a few weeks to get to know even just the people in my pledge class. Its also centered around service so it might not afford the type of social atmosphere youre looking for. Some of the families can be cliqueish and a lot of actives dont really try to get to know pledges all that well even those everyone wants a little. I hope someone will post info about AT. In any case its fantastic youre getting involved. I wasnt in any org my first  years here and I was super lonely. I bet that regardless of your choice of org youll fit in and start to love it!Also if you want more info on APO pm me!,UTAustin,cusvvtf,2,t5_2qy08

5886937,0,t3_3vwgpi,Look at the reviews on Google plus under the search for dobie... There are some real horror stories.That said you have to consider the source. These are college kids who prob dont have great financial habits make LOTS of noise ALL the time and use the internet til  am to skype making it hellishly slow. The boilers arent magic so if you shower at  am when everyone else gets up to shower yeah it might be cold. It is what it is and stuff like that really honestly isnt unique to Dobie.I thought Dobie was pretty safe its hard to wind up at any one persons room unless youre supposed to be there or you live there. My top advice would be to keep really good detailed payment records when you live in Dobie. Like keep a binder with printed out dated bank statements amp other proof of payment a copy of your leasing agreement printed copies of any complaints you make or repairs you request... yeah. Get any lease incentitives in writing signed and dated by management dont be scared to POLITELY express you need things in writing with a signature and date. Dont do business by the phone do it by email so you can print it and have it time stamped by a neutral third party or do it in person and send a follow up email with the terms agreed on as a polite reminder amp print that correspondence. If your signature goes on something youre entitled to a copy even if you have to snap a pic with ur phone. I was an RA amp I then worked for an apartment for a year and my top thing that people SHOULD but dont do other than keep records of everything is to take inventory of the room the second you step into it. As soon as you put your suitcase down go through the room. Anything dirty broken with holes in it any damage to structure... yeah take pictures and keep them in your records. A video you upload to youtube is admissible in small claims court it shows a date by a neutral party and the original condition when you move in so you cant be charged for damage someone else did. Report stuff asap and keep a record of the report because even if it takes a month to get fixed it supports that you did not cause the damage and sought to have it fixed rather than ignoring it. Seriously if people did stuff like that wherever they lived a lot fewer situations would go down. Anyways good luck and congrats on acceptance ,UTAustin,cxrb7jp,2,t5_2qy08

You went to SMU and took all those classes?You really need to make the time line more clear. You took those classes at SMU and then went to UT as undeclared? For how long? If so I am sorry but I think you mightve been misguided. Internal transfers are not taken at higher rates than other transfers. Also You shouldnt be looking into transferring having all that course work done just go ahead and finish your degree.I am sorry for the hindsight but you shouldnt have taken those classes AND then applied. UTCS if you wanted to graduate from here. The department rarely takes people who have their Upper Division classes done elsewhere as our program is good for those very classes. They are ok with you taking Calculus Physics and humanities elsewhere though.Here are the reasons you were most likely deniedAllowing people in when they are almost done doesnt really benefit the school since they cant guarantee you are wholly immersed in the UT mindset and education rigor. And there is much higher likelihood you wouldnt participate in school activities. You would be working in lots of classes and not have time for this. In other words with a UT CS degree you would  be representing our school. Also electives are incredibly hard to get in as it is admitting more people purely for electives wouldnt make sense. Your algorithms Discrete Math Logic Design you dont need digital design. Its unnecessary for CS here scientific computing or Assembly would not transfer either. You would have to retake those. Basically only your fundamentals and data structures would. And you would have to retake everything else CS related. People who get here with an Associates degree in CS having all basics done going the same path you would almost never take less than  and a half years to graduate.  years in average. According to the Deans office when I visited them when I first got denied for CS. Unfortunately some of those are the classes they really want you to take here.This is all that I learned after having talked to many people. Including the head of the admissions department someone at the Dean of the CNS department.If you are so close to being done just be done with this! go make some real money dude. I honestly suggest you to just go and graduate rather than keep waiting for admissions.,UTAustin,d4euz2m,3,t5_2qy08

My professors are a mixed bag theyre either incredibly nice or theyre really not nice and its about a  mix. Might come with studying engineering.

Referring to these distorted meanings as the real meaning simply because they are widespread in the elitedominated information dissemination power structures is naive at best. If it would make you feel better we can take the short term approach the leftists often resort to and just invent a new word for what we meant by reparations initially until that one becomes co opted and distorted again and repeat the process later but frankly that process tires me.

Those majors are well respected and will get you jobs in any sector while majoring in IRG will make it challenging to reach outside of government work or lower paying gigs. Even IB runs into the problem where you dont get taught many hard skills.Academically Ive really enjoyed the people in IRG and the classes have been okay. The major is very easy to customize and it makes for a very interesting course load. Unfortunately I feel like the major leaves you pretty unprepared for job hunting but it is very fun.

10311160,0,t1_dcc7dbx,Im an International Relations major so I need to fulfill the lower devision Requirements which I did at Community College and take two Upper devision courses which are very hard. peoples abilities varied but it seamed like nearly everyone could understand Spanish and speak it decently. I was very impressed by the majority of my classmates abilities. I dont know much about the Coops you can probably get a permit to park in the street. Id Imagine different Co Ops have different cultures. So if I were you Id search or make a new post to see if any are quiet and what they are like.  also here is a website they can direct you to some of the housing around UT.   Idk if it is just a directory or if they are a business that ones and leases property. I havent used them but it may be of some use to you.Just an FYI  West Campus. West Campus is a Neighborhood to touches the UT Campus. Everything will be a   minute walk to campus and some of the buildings for the language classes are not too far from west campus if you stay in the further south section of West Campus like around st street. Its a pretty cool Neighborhood. Assuming you choose to live off campus instead of in dorms and everything els is equal Id live in west campus over other nearby neighborhoods. Edit One final note. The ground floods during really heavy rains so Id recomend getting a pair of rain boots or water proof shoes that are comfortable to walk in. Youll probably need them once or twice a semester.Best of luck to you!,UTAustin,dcctqyy,2,t5_2qy08

10937306,0,t3_5w5g3r,There is an algorithm in the recruiting system. Admissions has a certain number of spaces for events like that and they adjust the parameters depending on how many they forecast will come. In the past it was simple rank and test scores could also be targeted for honors or low income depending. Now the system is a lot more sophisticated so theres no telling exactly what the standards are. Best of Texas is that an invitation for some of the top admitted students to try and persuade you to enroll. ,UTAustin,de83uep,3,t5_2qy08

AC is also very important to me but other than that I cant think of many other specific constraints. Convenient laundry would be nice too.Im looking to spend around . Also if you havent seen this you should check out rAustins moving to Austin guide Its really helpful. They recommend hiring someone to navigate the chaotic housing market which Im considering. They even recommend a couple specific agents that have served other redditors.Let me know what you think!

11010225,0,t3_5x5lvr,I took his German Sports and Politics class this past semester.  From your description of the grading Id imagine the class your asking about is similar in structure to the one I took. He is a pretty good professor and I learned a lot in the class. Can be a little dry at times but since it was a small discussionbased class the students made it lively enough. Lots of reading but I rarely did it except for the days he assigned me to answer questions.  Also he goes over the reading in class. Grade wise I would say he is tougher than average and expects a lot on the papers both research and writing but I think he is pretty fair. ,UTAustin,defz8cz,2,t5_2qy08

Theyll make sure you get the classes you need no matter what but not necessarily at good times. Make sure you claim whatever credits you want to use beforehand.

11548455,0,t3_64tmre,My personal storyI aced everything in High School. Came to UT. Got my ass handed to me. Eventually stopped caring. Graduated with a .. In retrospect I wish I had tried harder. I wish I had taken more initiative and explored a bit more in a lot of ways. I wish I had learned more.You know I also came to the realization that I am not meant to be an academic. Its the sad truth. I also believe some people arent meant to go to college. Its not that theyre lesser beings but if your talentinterest and college have no real ties I maintain that college isnt for everyone. But on the plus side this also kind of invokes that one silly saying if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will spend its entire life thinking it is stupid. Embrace who you are. Im not saying you dont belong at UT nor that you should drop out. But that you should give yourself more realistic standards.To be honest with you my sympathy for you is limited. I hear you whining a lot that youre not acing everything like you deserve to. Grow up. College is hard especially at UT Austin. and if youre not getting the results in all facets of life you want you need to change your approach. Own your mistakes. Im not telling you youre a failure. Youre not. You got into UT. Dont take a hit to your academic ego to heart it doesnt mean youre stupid. It doesnt mean youre a failure. A grade is just a number and having been out here in the real world for sometime I can PROMISE YOU no one except in academia cares about your test scores. Theyre just a number albeit an important number that does kind of give you an idea of how well you know the material. Dont take the short sighted view. Dont sell yourself short.Learn to gracefully accept criticisms which are not always given to you by other people  as youre figuring out you seem to be struggling with this. Part of college is learning how to handle this adversity. Weve all been there. ,UTAustin,dg50qfl,12,t5_2qy08
