1575539,0,t1_cjdqt0r,Ah thats good to see those numbers. I thought I remembered Suzuki commenting several times that if their next movie doesnt succeed the company would be in trouble. I think he said that for Arrietty. He seemed worried about The Wind Rises too and Miyazaki said it felt like digging their own grave. And Suzuki was especially worried when The Bamboo Cutter was delayed and cost even more money. They have a saying a movie is a gamble but maybe they were just being pessimistic.Also not to be pessimistic as well but remember that the box office is the amount of money earned from movie ticket sales. The physical movie theaters get a bit less than half of the money on average and the distributor gets the rest. How much Ghibli gets from the distributor depends on their contract. I think its Toho that distributes Ghibli in Japan and Disney in America.On the more optimistic side Studio Ghibli movies are consistently top grossing in Japan. They also get a lot of money from licensing for merchandise.,ghibli,cjdrpi0,1,t5_2riwr

6196132,0,t3_408z0d,I watched Kikis Delivery Service a few days ago and realised all over again how magnificent it is. Noone understands kids quite like Miyazaki. The scene where Kiki flops onto her bed and just lies there or when she rushes to her room to avoid the silent baker or when she gets all snooty around Tombo because shes embarrassed show Miyazakis keen powers of observation and evidence his incredible empathy. His willingness to show the depths of Kikis sadness and empathise so strongly with her normal yet profound teenage problems is where the films emotional pull springs from. He lets sadness and joy exist together and not as opposites of each other like the TV show Freaks and Geeks which is one of my favourites for the same reason. And this gives the film a complexity and honesty that I think sometimes goes unremarked upon.,ghibli,cytxn6x,2,t5_2riwr

Those scenes were really well animated.The movie also handled it in a really clever way too. Kiki didnt just immediately know how to ride the broom like a pro she had to get used to it and even then she still never really became a pro at it. This led to a lot of tense flying scenes throughout the movie.Not to mention that getting used to something new is a big theme of the movie.,ghibli,d57n91n,3,t5_2riwr

8329930,0,t3_4tmg8v,A slightly tooindepth answer is that its meant to be black but they use a very dark purple because natural black dyes all tend to have very dark shades of other colours in them.  This is why old black clothing is so hard to match and why youll see varying shades of reds or blues in black clothing thats gotten sun bleached.  So since Kikis dress is probably made from natural fiber with a natural dye youre both right ,ghibli,d5isoq6,7,t5_2riwr
8365822,1,t3_4u5c51,gtbut the mother says that even the bones are soft so if its bird it cant be eaten whole.Why not? My family eats the bones of chicken all the time. If you cook it just right the bones go soft. The marrow inside is really tastey and the outer shell just crumbles. Using a slow cooker is an easy way to get them like that.gtthe food didnt turn Chihiros dad into a pig but the true pig within emerged. Thats weird considering he was hungry and he had both cash and credit to pay for the food he was eating. What about that is being a pig? Thats how the whole world works. If you are hungry you eat and pay for your meal. Its not the dads fault the shop keeper who might I say SELLS food and makings a living off SELLING food albeit to supernatural beings wasnt there to say no. Even so the mom was wearing jewelry so if they didnt want Japanese currency they could give an earring made of real gold which is a currency we know they use from the No Face fiasco.gtUnlike Chihiro her parents are stuck in a trap set by gods or mythical creatures. Thats such a dickish thing to do. Yeah fuck these humans for being hungry and willing to pay for their meal. They should turn into pigs and die. God forbid they send  spirit to say hey humans arent allowed here.

9974141,0,t3_5ichvm,I like to think that the girl the passengers on the train and the other shadow people are ghosts of mortals humans who have died or otherwise lost their physical bodies.  They are lost in the spirit world perhaps doomed to eternally ride the train as they attempt to find a resting place for their spiritssouls.This is why some of them seem to have modern accessories like the old shadow man who was wearing a newspaper cap and pulling his bags out of the overhead storage rack.  The style of hat and bags are very modern compared to other things in the film.  You can see an image of this man at the bottom of this page to the right just above the conclusion section.The spirits were never alive and mortal so they never died and they have the ability to transform and become solid.  I dont know about Yubaba and Zeniba but Haku and other spirits who represent places in the mortal world might be able to travel between the mortal and spirit worlds.Chihiro and her parents have solid physical bodies because they are still alive so they brought their bodies with them.,ghibli,db7noxl,15,t5_2riwr

10225880,0,t3_5mdgfr,To be honest....not really. I am a huge Ghibli fan but was severely disappointed with Ni No Kuni. Whilst very pretty especially the animated cutscenes i felt it was hugely lacking storywise. I wouldve expecting a game that Studio Ghibli were involved in to have a much more complex and interesting story. And this one just didnt. The world was very generic and the characters underdeveloped which was a huge surprise for me as complex characters are almost a hallmark of Studio Ghibli productions.I know that Level handled the actual game and Ghibli mainly did the art design but i was disappointed theyd lend their name and talent to something that felt very shallow to me. I think it could have been incredible to play an actual Studio Ghibli game with all the complexity of character deeply emotional story and unique interesting worlds. Imagine it changing art style as well switching between the beautiful vibrancy of Miyazaki to the stark beauty of Takahata at times of heightened emotion or whatever.So Im probably not going to play the sequel. They created a pretty boring world and Im not really interested in going back there. It lacked the charm and wonder of a true Ghibli world and i dont see them changing that.,ghibli,dc35so9,5,t5_2riwr

11587587,0,t1_dg9dqq1,and thats a big problem why everything is getting watered down so focused on the possible movie they may or may not be making in the future that they lose sight of the one they are making right now. if they start off loose and disjointed than they started before they were ready before they had their path fully figured out. they started because thats when the arbitrary timetable that was made months ago said they were to start regardless of where they were in the development of the story right now and the only reason the time table says to start then is because theyve already started to develop the timetable for the sequel based off the production they havent even finished yet. no need to focus on the job at hand right now weve got future possibilities to squander. oh but no time just hit the highlights and keep moving the ones who do know will be happy and the ones who dont know wont know the difference. and thats a major problem an industry breaking problem. they seem to know exactly what they are doing and purposefully making these types of movies not for the fans who actually like these stories but the people who dont know any different. it would be better to focus on the movie they are making by using their craftsmanship skills and creating a good product in and of itself instead of starting on a weak note and pleading that trust me itll get better. this isnt a picture though this is film not one static image but  pictures every  seconds. the pictures may speak for themselves but you have to craft the meaning that connects them if their method of storytelling is just putting up imagesscenescapesenvironments and saying make your own meaning that is quite possibly the laziest form of storytelling that could be mustered. as artistic as it may be lazy nonetheless. and laziness leads to only one thing more excuses to continue being lazy.try harder thats what the original creators of these stories did and thats why they are so good and why we love them and why we want to reproduce them. try as hard as they did. if we dont than what we are really striving for when we recreate these stories is for the focus to be on us telling the story and not the story itself. which is the other part of the problem we think we are whats important in telling these stories were not the story should be the only thing that matters. this story not the next one this very one.,ghibli,dg9gkv0,9,t5_2riwr
