2374242,0,t1_cm50arz, You dont know how reproducibility works. Its more of a we did this and this and if you do the same you should get the same result or we looked there using such and such instrument and if you look there with the same instrument you should see what we saw. UFO sightings do not fulfill those criteria which renders them unscientific. Its possible but wouldnt such an advanced race do somewhat more advanced things than slashing cows and poking at some stoned hicks anus? Then stop calling it parapsychology paranormal etc.  See the Blackbird and other such things its rather logical to assume that there are other secret aircraft currently being developed and tested. We can shoot unmanned aircraft at gs no humans can withstand and have been able to do so for decades. Why one would need unearthly energy sources or any physics breakthrough for that is beyond me all you need is sophisticated engineering.Hallucinations have not been debunked there are numerous studies that can explain those events by purely terrestrial means. As for mass hysteria tens of thousands of people claimed they saw the sun dance at Fatima in October of   doesnt mean it happened. Mass hallucinations are a real thing.,ThreadKillers,cm55y64,1,t5_2zw5i
