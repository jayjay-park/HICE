171754,0,t3_1w1jhi,Name The Honorable  Mason Stayloft District Judge  Description Mason is an altruist if ever there was one.  However being an altruist doesnt necessarily mean that everyone loves you especially when doing good alienates the interests of those who would be your friends.  Mason graduated law school and wanted to make a change in the world for the better but due to rising political corruption found the journey to be hard.  He alienated a lot of people in his career due to his unflinching take on justice and his steadfast resistance to being bought out.  He watched likeminded compatriots fall from grace and take the easier path.  Eventually he became a judge.  Hes middle aged between  and  years old but still in remarkable good health he looks about  years younger than he is aside from his hair which is in the process of greying and becoming white.  He is very intelligent but rather average in terms of looks.  He despises violence and would prefer to sway others to his cause through conversation instead of brute action.  Appearance Hes about  feet tall  pounds.  Blue eyes.  No tattoos.  Very professional and immaculately groomed.  Wears a pair of spectacles and is nearsighted.

1955093,0,t3_2gwyet,TIMES!Days requested to not play Monday Wednesday Friday. Xistenzs hours do not match up to ours on Tuesday. Thursdays are bad for me because I always have multiple tests Friday and online homework due. So this leaves the weekend. In my experience Sundays dont work too well but they are an option. This brings me to the idea Saturday would be the best day.Hours on Saturday GMT. Can you guys give me an updated availability times for Saturday?,RoleplayAdventure,ckosipd,1,t5_2zgj5
4067244,0,t1_crjh2y3,Well I guess Ill have him be a humanophile originally close to the priestly class but rejecting them due to their conservatism leaving home out of a desire to learn human magic and culture as well as to try and bring the two races closer together as a whole. Also do the lizards have a kind of temporalsacred kinship divide between military leaders and priests?,RoleplayAdventure,crjw7f2,1,t5_2zgj5
