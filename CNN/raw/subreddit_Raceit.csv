8131919,0,t3_4qgohw,gt Once you start expecting shitty things and know how to deal with them shitty things stop happening...I love this line. I was reading the article thinking I had never experienced a low point like the author said and then I remembered the time I forgot to leave my run shoes in transition so I ran the first  miles in a . in just socks. Or how I dropped my chain at the bottom of a hill in the same race a year later. Or how I suddenly had The Urge on a  mile trail run with the nearest porta potty  miles away ok I guess that technically qualifies as shitty D. Or several other issues in various races.,Raceit,d4u3n5r,1,t5_2tm2s
