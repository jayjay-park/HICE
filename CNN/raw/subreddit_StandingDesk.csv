10325759,0,t3_4ticj2,Considering buying the SmartDesk Home. These reviews are concerning. I do have to say these types of things are expected with new companies still sorting things out like manufacturingmaterialslogistics etc. However Ill probably hold off on purchasing and keep an eye on this thread. I do think they Autonomous have some interesting stuff at a great price though. GL.,StandingDesk,dcehd72,1,t5_30t9f

A  second google search brought this up which is rather informative.Looking at ergonofis.com it is very difficult to understand the value youre getting for that price point... they are on the higherpriced size of the price scale and hopefully thats due to good materials and a great warranty which is unclear on the site.,StandingDesk,deyyrgc,1,t5_30t9f
