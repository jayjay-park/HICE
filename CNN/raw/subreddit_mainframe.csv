8945271,0,t3_52st7m,We gave RDz a spin at my shop a long while ago.It was a pretty decent product mostly appreciated by people who had to work on a mix of mainframe and nonmainframe components. The most common thing I heard about it was that it made it easier for people to seamlessly switch between writing code in Java locally manipulating datasets and editing JCL on MVS through the GUI and then deploying their complete code on z. I dont know of anyone who used it exclusively for mainframe coding though so I cant shed any light on that. The ability to work with datasets right inside the UI was pretty convenient for some people as well.The biggest complaint came from those who were already used to working directly in ISPF. They found it a little annoying that things that normally could be done quickly on a keyboard now required a mouse like clicking through the usual Eclipselike dialogs. Most of them eventually went back to using ISPF after a few days of playing around with RDz.Obviously YMMV but at least for my place RDz found a better following with people who only dealt with the mainframe for product deployment and very cursory dataset work the ones that usually didnt keep a  emulator open all day. I was one of those people and for that type of work I actually enjoyed the unified workflow RDz brought.,mainframe,d7n38hq,5,t5_2s04g

Its always the middle part part two that causes so much discussion about how difficult to make it as this is the part that bridges the very easy part one with the very difficult part three... some years we get it right some years we dont!,mainframe,d9plwug,6,t5_2s04g
