7087105,0,t3_4cm5kp,Very cool! Thanks for sharing. Its worth pointing out  to developers moreso than endusers  that the architecture used by Desk streams screen captured image data via TCP from a persistent background service. This makes it easy to capture amp share this data with various applications and even other network hosts. It may be worthwhile to implement a basic authentication mechanism otherwise any software that opens a TCP connection to the port the service runs on will start receiving a stream of screen captured images may be a securityprivacy issue.  A note to the developerOP You may find that particularly for localhost clients encoding the screenshot into bmp format may be a faster option than jpg because of the lack of compression amp decompression.
