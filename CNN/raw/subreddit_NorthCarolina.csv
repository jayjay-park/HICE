Im not sure what a right to expect is what it has to do with what taxes are or what it has to do with my comment. I guess you just cant respond to anything I actually said but you thought that sounded emotionally appealing and bitching about republicans didnt really stick. But um... Sure. You have a right to expect whatever you want whether its the state to give you steadily increasing amounts of coerced money or flying pigs. As a matter of fact I recommend everyone here tell their employers that they have a right to a salary increase that not only matches inflation but matches the amount that the state will have to increasingly extort out of them to pay teachers.

675066,0,t1_cggzvhb,Trust me Democrats were complaining about the old districts as well. Isnt that what youre arguing about by mentioning the th district lawsuit anyways?The bottom line is we need independent commissions based upon a nonpartisan formula going forward. It will never be perfect. Few things are in government and we have to just deal with that if this whole America thing is worth it to us. But we can do a lot better than this current system which is letting the NCGA  a body that only exists for two years as it does when redrawing the lines  set the standards for the next . I say we take it out of the hands of the electorate who have a large portion of their members focused solely on reelection and put it in the hands of people interested in a system that works best for the people. The current independent commissions in other states seem to be working great! Lets try that.I guarantee that if you went back in time and explained how redistricting works across most of the country and the effects it has had in creating partisan gridlock at the hands of Dems and GOPers to the Framers they would punch you in the mouth. This the General Assembly coming up with a system to help them best preserve their jobs above all else was not what they had in mind.,NorthCarolina,cgh077y,3,t5_2qhmx

In North Carolina you have to essentially own a brewery before you can get a brewers notice.

However each country defines their minimum wage based on their own political agenda. In the US it is set primarily by calculating the average cost of living in the US as a whole.Ok then go with wages mandated by cost of living. Or just any example of low skill wages being set artificially high in order to decrease tax extraction. Just anything similar to this regardless of these subjective terms. Forget purchasing power ever we can just go with taxes since the claim is that tax payers are subsidizing minimum wage earners. Show me the government forcing businesses to cover the cost and then lowering tax extraction anywhere any time ever. gtI would like to see data that shows a correlation between a minimum wage hike and social welfare dependency.A minimum wage increase is a form of social welfare because the corporations who can afford them the most get the biggest tax breaks and grants for hiring people.

A salaried worker is not defined as working over  hours per week as you have implied.  Instead it is as you say a contract between employer and employee.  gt Whoopido if youre seasonal labor. Youre getting paid more than people who work  months out of the year.We can go around and around and you can keep bringing up the silly argument of the  month year talk to me about annual salary divided by annual hours or dont this argument is going nowhere and Ill keep bringing up the arguments you consider silly.  At the end of the day people complain about teacher quality but they dont want to pay the higher rates that attract qualified candidates to the profession.  Schools do get some excellent teachers who are attracted by their passion for the profession rather than the money but they also get people who are not as qualified.  As an undergrad I considered teaching at the high school level because I would be good at it and I received excellent reviews from students and faculty as a teaching assistance in grad school but I decided against that path because of the long hours low pay and low respect.  Im sure you dont care about whether a random internet person youre arguing with decided to become a teacher or not.  But when I was teaching I was passionate and skilled about it and putting in more hours than most other teaching assistants.  There are passionate and qualified candidates who are giving the teaching profession a pass.,NorthCarolina,ck606zo,1,t5_2qhmx

This law required doctors to show and describe the ultrasound to pregnant women even if she refuses to look or listen. Forcing women to listen to the description is not a medical procedure by any means its a blatant attempt to badger women into changing their minds. Obviously women in this position will most likely be highly emotional vulnerable and easily influenced and this law takes advantage of that because it requires doctors to describe in great detail information that goes well beyond understanding the scope of the procedure. Its a direct attempt to influence and alter womens decisions for ideological reasons.  gtIt takes a bold ideologue to insist people undergo a procedure whilst uninformed AKA ignorant of what is happening to their body and the body of their fetusI  would say child or baby but such plain words would offend a compassionate defender of human rights such as yourself.No it takes a bold ideologue to force doctors to force information beyond the medical procedure onto women even if they directly object to this. Understanding the procedure and risks is important but everyone knows what happens to an aborted fetus so forcefully describing it in detail violates the Constitutional rights of both the doctor and the mother. Youre forcing a doctor to give detailed descriptions of the fetus shes carrying even if she directly objects to this. gtI  would say child or baby but such plain words would offend a compassionate defender of human rights such as yourselfNo what offends me is people like you forcing your religious beliefs on others with absolutely zero regard for their Constitutional rights.

3544476,0,t1_cpw7340,gtburqasThank you for correcting my spelling infraction I dont know how I let such a grievous oversight pass.So you are against the free practice of some constitutional rights just not all. Thank you for clarifying that point for me. Shall I continue on down the list to see which rights you think should be restricted? Are you for or against the quartering of troops in peoples houses? Obviously that is an outdated notion perhaps we should repeal that? How about search and seizure rights? Obviously if you dont do anything wrong you should have nothing to hide. Right to be free of self incrimination? How about if Im accused of being a domestic terrorist because of my stockpile of gasp! dangerous weapons and a forced confession could possibly keep you safer. What rights should I be able to practice freely that would make you more comfortable and secure in your feelings as you move about your daily activities? The fact that you feel people practicing their constitutional right to bear arms is dangerous which is evident in how you keep emphasizing that it is a dangerous weapon even though the gun itself isnt dangerous its the person that wields it in an unsafe or illegal manner which makes for a dangerous situation makes little difference. It is a constitutionally protected right. If we are to allow businesses to dictate when and how we practice those rights where do we draw the line?

4054346,0,t1_cridzuj,Short answer  no trespassing is an issue of premises liability contributory negligence is generally not at issue in personal injury suits involving trespassing.  However you are correct that under NC law a trespasser would have a very difficult time suing the landowner for injuring themselves on the owners land.Long answerA classic contributory negligence scenario is where a pedestrian gets hit by a car while jaywalking.  Jaywalking is negligence because youre walking in an area where you know cars are probably not looking for pedestrians the area is not marked for pedestrians and you know youre creating the risk that you could be hit.  The driver of the car could also be negligent by not looking out for possible pedestrians or texting while driving etc.  This is a situation where North Carolina differs from most states.  In most states the jury would parse out the relative percentage of fault in the case say  for the pedestrian jaywalking  the driver for not paying attention while driving and then reduce any award to the plaintiff accordingly say the jury decides the plaintiffs injuries are worth a million dollars but then the award would be reduced by  because she was  at fault.  In North Carolina the jaywalking pedestrian cant get anything if she was even  at fault because of our contributory negligence rule.  Now there are some exceptions to the contributory negligence rule that Id be glad to explain but Im gonna try to keep this straightforward and get to the trespassing issue.So trespassing.  As I said earlier trespassing is a premises liability issue.  Under NC law all people visiting on other peoples land fall into one of two categories  lawful visitors and trespassers.  Landowners owe different duties to each category.  For lawful visitors landowners must either fix or warn his visitors of all known risks and make a reasonable inspection of the property for any unknown risks.  So for example if a landowner invites people over for a BBQ and a visitor steps in a gopher hole in the backyard and breaks his ankle the landowner is liable.  The landowner should have either fixed the gopher hole warned his visitors of the gopher hole or if the landowner didnt know about the gopher hole should have made reasonable inspection of his property to find the gopher hole since it would have been found upon reasonable inspection of his property.  A landowner owes way less duty to trespassers.  A landowner is only liable to trespassers for willful or wanton acts of the landowner.  So if a trespasser sneaks onto that same landowners property at night and steps into the same gopher hole breaking his ankle?  Too bad.  Trespasser cant get anything.  The landowner didnt create that gopher hole and had no duty to fix it for a trespasser nor did he have any duty to warn the trespasser of it.Willful or wanton acts that could make a landowner liable to a trespasser are generally things a landowner intentionally does that he knows create risks for people on his property like laying bear traps in the woods behind his house or keeping aggressive dangerous animals on his property.So with all that explanation heres a relatively clear answer to your question  it depends on how the trespasser breaks his leg on your property.   If he broke his leg on something naturally occurring on your property rock fallen tree gopher hole then no hes not getting anywhere with a lawsuit.  If he broke his leg as a result of something dangerous you intentionally put on your property bear traps dangerous animals etc. he may have a basis to bring a lawsuit.However in the scenario where the trespasser breaks his leg on something dangerous you intentionally put on your property contributory negligence can come into play if you post warning signs.  So lets say you put bear traps in the woods on your property and a trespasser gets his leg broken by one of them.  Hes got an argument that you acted willfully or wantonly by putting bear traps on your property.  But if you put up a sign that said BEWARE bear traps in the woods! and the trespasser ignored the sign and came onto your property anyway you could argue contributory negligence.  If you warn the trespasser of the danger then the trespasser is negligent for ignoring that warning and likely could not recover.So...that got long but anyway hope that was interesting and not too confusing.  Id be glad to answer any other questions you have.,NorthCarolina,crifcov,9,t5_2qhmx

5255669,0,t3_3mwnni,Devils advocate here  in regards of the waterheating on rental units as of now landlords have been stuck with providing these two if tenants decide to not pay them.  So for example a tenant would be like Fck it Im not paying any more rent or any of my other bills and then the landlord would have to go through the process of eviction.Because the tenant has a right for water and heat the landlord would have to go out of his way to ensure that the tenants waterelectricity remained on even though they are not paying.  If the landlord wasnt available for any reason then the citypower company would have to eat the cost of providing electricity and water to the tenant.  This of course has the effect of raising rates for everyone else who happens to be a customer of the utility company.  If the utility cant recover these extra costs through increases to their customers then the city pays for it  which results in higher taxes.  Nothing is free and while Im not saying that these new measure are right theyre the result of people abusing the system because THEY KNOW that their waterpower wont be shut off if they stop paying.  Some WILL be hurt by this new legislation but please note that it wasnt a greedy landlord who created the situation where said legislation was needed it was common folk who decided that they would be smarter than the system and take advantage of it in any way they could.,NorthCarolina,cvjhvff,5,t5_2qhmx

Some of these reasons are protected by law in certain places like race sex religious and age discrimination being specifically illegal. Other countries dont have such laws and in fact in some countries you can be put to death for being an apostate renouncing religion and in other countries the baker may face punishment if a cake was made for a gay couple.

7298974,1,t1_d27pxv1,gt Considering they are using state funds to mount their defense they do have consider how winnable a legal fight will be This actually not true at all. NC statutes require the AG to defend the state andor state agencies that are named in a suit. The ONLY option the AG has to not defend a legal action in the state is if there is SIGNIFICANT reason to believe the statue will be declared unconstitutional. This is how Cooper got out of defending the states marriage amendment...there were federal courts overruling state and lower courts rulings already although even that is debatable as there had been different court rulings in different districts at the federal level.He may choose to not prosecute cases based on budget restrictions but defending the state is expressly written into our laws.This is nothing more than Cooper playing politics in an election year and seeking the spotlight for his candidacy in opposition to McCrory.I see little difference between him NOT doing the job he was elected to do and the magistrates that caught so much flack for not wanting to issue marriage licenses to same sex couple since they were refusing to do their job based on their personal opinion. ,NorthCarolina,d27udtb,0,t5_2qhmx

And when not if HB gets repealed they will get it back some other year if the point of noreturn has already passed.The difference between other state laws isnt just LGBT protection. Its that we moved backwards and it bars any city from fixing that. Honestly I believe there wouldnt be half the outcry if they allowed cities to enact their own policies regarding bathroom use.

7358014,0,t3_4g4qi7,Its bad for LGBT folks because it explicitly prevents cities from passing nondiscrimination legislation that is more inclusive than the state discrimination policy.For example the state law doesnt protect against discrimination based on any of the following sexual orientation affectional orientation gender identity gender expression.  HB prevents Charlotte or any other city from passing nondiscrimination legislation that adds the above protections.The conservative legislature in North Carolina claims that having more inclusive nondiscrimination policies somehow hurts businesses and will make North Carolina less attractive or companies looking to move here.  Thats been demonstrated to be absolutely untrue.The reality is that these sort of bills are just an attempt by the GOP to create a new wedge issue in an election year.The inability to sue in state court for discrimination effects all people.  I think they were thinking that it would be a probusiness move to make discrimination lawsuits more difficult across the board for everyone.The other thing that HB does that isnt talked about as much is that it prohibits cities from passing their own minimum wage laws.,NorthCarolina,d2ek0uk,15,t5_2qhmx

7580950,0,t3_4j2isv,But the DOJ could do so right now if they so desired.  In McCrory v. United States of America McCrory is only seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on Title Vll. What is missing in his suite against the United States is any such declaratory request for Title IX the Violation of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of  VAWA Executive Order  from The United States Department of Labor or many others for example NCWorks WIOA policies on Trangendered discrimination.  In United States of America v. State of North Carolina however those laws are the subject of two of the three counts against the state which are directed squarely against the University of North Carolina and Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina.   The legal problem for McCrory is that  for counts ll and lll and the funding that goes with them the protections for trangendered individuals are explicitly and clearly stated and the authority for enforcement is given directly to the Department of Justice. Whats even more damning for McCrorys case is that these laws were voted on by congress and receive affirmative votes by both the House and Senate leaders  of his own state.   Civil Rights A NondiscriminationNo person in the United States shall on the basis of actual or perceived race color religion national origin sex gender identity as defined in paragraph c of title  United States Code   the term gender identity means actual or perceived genderrelated characteristics sexual orientation or disability be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available  U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes th Congress  st Session S.    U.S.C.  North Carolina Burr RNC Yea Hagan DNC Yea  Attorney General Loretta Lynch in her public statement announcing the legal action against North Carolina alleged that the bathroom and changing facility provisions of H.B.  are engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination against transgender public employees. Thats a very specifically chosen sentence because  C Discrimination  U.S.C.  The authority of the Attorney General and the Office of Justice Programs to enforce this paragraph shall be the same as it is under section d of title  United States Code  E Whenever the Attorney General files a civil action alleging a pattern or practice of discriminatory conductthe Office of Justice Programs shall cause to have suspended further payment of any funds under this chapter to that specific program or activity alleged by the Attorney General to be in violation of the provisions  The justice Department under existing approval of congress does not require any further authority on many laws to withhold funds from North Carolina.  McCrorys suite against the United States has likely omitted Title lX from his declaratory and injunctive relief because a federal appellate court has already ruled that Title IX affirmatively protects the rights of students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit applies to North Carolina.  TLDR   The justice Department under existing approval of congress does not require any further authority on many laws to withhold funds from North Carolina.,NorthCarolina,d33x0vq,4,t5_2qhmx

Other states dont really care about NC insurance points.  It rather unlikely you will get this charge reduced to the point where no insurance points are issued but again that probably doesnt matter that much considering you have a CA license.If you are convicted of  over you will lose the ability to drive in NC for a period of time.  If you have an out of state license they will just ban you from driving here and notify your home state if you have a NC license they will take it.Because of our laws if you go to court or get a lawyer you can expect a reduction in charges.  NC residents have to be very careful speeding in other state because they may not similarly negotiate charges and NC will suspend your license here if you get convicted of a  over in another state.Your main goal is going to be a reduction down to  over. ,NorthCarolina,d5fyvhh,2,t5_2qhmx

8641839,0,t1_d6lsl1s,This was so great thank you! I made it all the way through too.I can see your perspective on each point and I agreed with many of your concerns and arguments. I do think one big problem is the dissemination of information as in making sure people understand how absentee voting works education about voter registration and so on. The counterpoint obviously is you can only do so much. Voting is a right that you can choose to exercise or not and so I do think you have to allow for a fair amount of personal responsibility as you would with getting a drivers license or setting up utilities.That said on the matter of early voting how do you slice that as being more of convenienceprivilege instead of the extension of the right to vote? Because while you can participate in absentee voting its no surprise that people would rather have their vote in the firstcounted group and not the countedifnecessary pile. Thats how I understand it correct me if Im wrong. I see early voting a bit like trying to see the doctor on the eveningsweekend while having a  job. You can make it happen during work time but god how wonderful is it when you dont have to interrupt your day or use PTO to take care of this personal matter!Of course if we could institute your idea and I so so wish it would happen then Election Day is a holiday. Employers dont have to worry about employees being at long poll lines employees dont have to worry about getting between their polling place and work and everyone can just do the thing and party. If you dont or cant vote cool. Enjoy your day off. Murica. That would eliminate the need for early voting in most cases would probably raise awarenesseducation about the registration process that hits sameday and out of precinct issues and would certainly save money early voting  government holiday. Why havent we done this already honestly?Thanks for the quality reply now I really want an Election Day holiday. And its not just because its my birthday this year.

Lexingtonian is an adaptation of that.Im in the Eastern camp. I think ketchup is a condiment for children that no self respecting cook should be putting it on their meat and I believe in whole hog. But hey thats just my opinion.The problem is the heavy handed attempts by the Lexingtonians to try and legitimize theirs as the official BBQ of the state. Just look at the way theyve editorialized the Wikipedia page to try and make it appear as if theirs is the true BBQ listing Lexingtonian first and devoting half the article for the Lexington BBQ Festival. Most of us are content to just let them have their kiddie BBQ and that be the end of it but oh no on no less than two occasions have they attempted to force their ketchup meat on us by law.Among many natives even ordering the other style over what you were born and raised with is a taboo act  you eat your BBQ or you dont eat BBQ at all.

How many of them were left behindignored in the last election?  if you look at PA OH and MI youll see a lot of them werePerhaps the Democrats should examine their own house first.Notwithstanding both sides should be asking the question of whether or not placating the extreme rightleft of their base is the surest way to garner support.,NorthCarolina,dgdecdo,0,t5_2qhmx

11666796,0,t3_66dxyf,No hes not.  Heres why. New details in Bladen voter fraud claims  article from December gtDemocrats and Republicans on the State Board of Elections agreed that there was enough probable cause to move forward with a full hearing about the Bladen County absentee ballot issue.gtRodger Knight an attorney representing Dowless and McCrory told the SBOE that an inspection of approximately  absentee mailin ballotsindicates a scheme or an organized effort where it appears the purported voter did not actually vote the ballot himself.gtWhile reviewing absentee ballots Bladen County Board of Elections Member Brian Hehl testified they noticed similar handwriting on many ballots for the writein candidate Franklin Graham for Soil and Water Conservation supervisor. They then determined that the witnesses for many of these ballots were Get Out the Vote workers for the Bladen County Improvement Association PAC.gtSpecifically Mary Johnson signed as a witness to at least  ballots Deborah Moore signed as a witness for  ballots Lola Wooten signed as a witness for at least  ballots and Barbara Cogdell signed as a witness to  ballots. All of these women are paid workers for the BCIA.gtNotably most of the ballots they signed do not indicate that the voter requested assistance for filling out their ballot as is required when someone else fills out a ballot for you.If both Democrats and Republicans agreed at the time there was probable cause to consider voter fraud in this case as well as others then this is going nowhere.,NorthCarolina,dgig365,8,t5_2qhmx

This is not the civil disobedience of those that sat at the counter of a White diner or Rosa Parks refusing to get to the back of the bus or even those that staged a sitin at Berkley this is called fucked up. Now if these protesters had a permit and like a parade gets and alternative routes were made then Im down but an impromptu protest blocking the streets fuck you.,NorthCarolina,dgsw9wg,-9,t5_2qhmx
11764238,0,t1_dgtdpv1,If you are being attacked it is already not illegal to defend yourself by driving away.  If someone attacking you got hit at that point its not your fault if you were actually threatened.This law would give people in vehicles the ability to run over anyone at a protest even if they are nonviolent.  Its legalizing vigilantism and bypassing due process on top of straight up promoting vehicular homicide.
