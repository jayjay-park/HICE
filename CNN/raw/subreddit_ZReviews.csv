6615598,0,t3_46apfy,I dont know how effective it is but MusicBee has a function that checks your rip for accuracy against an online database of rips that have been done in the past.When I rip a CD that is a bit scratched up there are times when it will tell me tracks are not accurate and if I listen to them they do skip at times so I know the check function is doing something. Sometimes it also tells me its an inaccurate rip when there just arent many rips out there to compare it against though like when I ripped the latest Starkill album and it only had  to  previous rips to compare it against in the database.I assume as long as your song rips show as accurate when compared against a database of previous rips of the same album it would be fine no matter the optical drive.But this is not a comment coming from lots of experience so you may want to either verify my statements or wait for someone more knowledgeable to chime in.,ZReviews,d03lxzh,2,t5_39bkk

Id pay an extra  for extra strength and higher build quality even if it added a bit more weight.The metal parts with holes are those adjustable metal slider things on the side. They have punchedthru holes on the bottom think of metal tubes with circular holes near the bottom and then a plastic tubes passes through the holes in the adjustable metal tubes and then the plastic bit on the outside is fused on thermallyfused probably  injection molding wouldnt work because of the complex internal structure and no way to remove scaffolding.The plastic bit just feels cheap and unnecessary and adds build complexity. Using a single metal ball joint with screw holes that pass through the adjustable metal tubesbars on the sides is just simpler tougher and would look and feel nicer.

9851041,0,t1_darlryi,I bought the TP. without listen to them first but I was pleasantly surprised. I wanted a closed can for work that had good lowend and they fit the bill perfectly.As for the sub bass that has nothing to do with the tier they are in.  It is how they are designed and tuned to sound. The frequency graph gives a good picture of what the sound is going to be like.Basically once you hit  dollars you are focusing more on what sound signature you want rather than on things like detail. There is more detail in the  range but is it worth the extra thousand or more dollars? Its diminishing returns at that point.The Elear are an amazing headphone no doubt about it. I havent heard the other audeze headphones but they have a different sound. If you have a headphone shop around your area you should visit it. I am lucky in that I have  of them that are dedicated to audiophile headphones although neither carries Ultrasone.Based on what I have heard the Elear is better all around than the Fostex to my ears and to many others. But again it comes down to what music you listen to and what sound you are looking for.The Elear are not bright but to many people the highs on the TH are too much for them. Ive got some hearing loss around the k range and I think that helps me in regards to the highs on some of these headphones.,ZReviews,darm3ae,2,t5_39bkk

11427799,0,t3_60hlk2,One more technically not a headphone though Stax L with the Brainwavz sheepskins NON ANGLED real leather version only. I tried the angled sheepskins and they really hurt after a while. The headphones are already at an angle so it gives it bad pressure points. The sound and soundstage is.... about the same between the two to be honest. I tried swapping back and forth. Just get some M double sided tape put  strips on the back of the pads top bottom left right and glue it as low on the headphone as you can get them without sticking out. If you put them in the very middle they will form a seal and you need to put straws underneath. Plus it gives more room since I run an HD headband cushion attached to the Stax headband strap which was uncomfortable.Protip leather always wins in leather vs pleather as far as sound quality goes.
