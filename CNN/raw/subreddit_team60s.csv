3761428,0,t3_33hx76,gtTHEIR MISSION IS FOR THERE TO BE NO MORE SThat is complete bullocks. They extend the life of the Button so we get more time for s to be created. Suppose the Button perished. Not a single s would be chosen after that . So by prolonging the buttons life they create time for more s to be chosen.On top of that in their mission a lot of Knights will perish in their mission and they will be chosen as a s by the Button. Surely you can see how this benefits us?! The fact remains since the other colours have become more easy to achieve almost noone will deliberately try for a s anymore. Having people fight for red flairs will create a many more s than us trying to convert greys would.,team60s,cql14fo,6,t5_37mzg

No.  They too will become empty wastelands only to receive brief flickers of activity on the anniversaries of our creation April Fools Day of every year.This is what the Knights and the Redguard fight to prevent against.
