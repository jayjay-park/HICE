3783288,0,t1_cqmns08,Xavi Iniesta Messi Pique Pedro and Valdez all came through La Masia to become essential to the starting .  Bartra and Montoya are important first team players.  Alba and Fabregas developed in Barca before being sent elsewhere.  Thats ignoring players who came through the academy only to be successful for other clubs like Bojan Dos Santos and Tello.  Busquets even spent the end of his youth career there.Youre right that LAFC will be about the bottom line but theres also the business aspect of a successful academy.  Selling off academy players could fund the purchase of DPs as opposed to sponsors alone.  Top prospects are constantly being produced like El Haddadi and Deulofeu.  you could argue that not all of these players were born in Barcelona but if you grow up in a region since the age of  or  Id call that home grown.Theres absolutely a huge financial benefit to investing in youth and it isnt unfeasible to be successful with this model as you suggest.  Im not saying this is the direction LAFC will go but there isnt significant competition in MLS when it comes to top class academies.  Given that LAFCs academy would be in LA it would have a huge leg up over national competitors as well as the huge pool that comes with the greater LA area. Edit letter,LAFC,cqniur1,3,t5_34ahu

4688769,0,t3_3f2tln,I cant make it next week so heres my one big pet issueHAVE A REAL STANDING AREA FOR THE SUPPORTERS END.Let them know that we understand the insurance and ADA stuff and remind them that its still very doable.  Remind them that for nonsoccer events that end of the stadium can be used for a stage prep area etc.  Point out that a well designed standing area is significantly safer than having people standing on or in front of plastic seats or benches.  A make sure that they know youre talking about the whole end not just some little token area like San Jose has. That is all.  And thank you!,LAFC,ctlk9yi,2,t5_34ahu
4762655,0,t3_3fy08a,Less Advertising  higher ticket pricesLess advertising  less big name signingsless advertising  less people in the seatsCarson isnt that bad.  I am not willing to pay a premium to have less ads.  I would be willing to pay a premium if the kit didnt have an ad on it but we all know that isnt going to happen.  Dont waste your breath or your bargaining positions on trying to convince the owners to make less money.  Its not going to happen and it is a waste of your time and makes it look like supporters are unreasonable.  If early supporters are unreasonable why should they listen to anything they have to say? ,LAFC,ctuvld5,1,t5_34ahu

5220337,0,t3_3mchi9,After today I can say that I dont think you have anything to worry about.  They seem dedicated to using local businesses as much as possible and extending benefits outside the stadium.  The meeting today was only about the stadium and game day experience so the academy didnt even come up.  Theyre going to host an open town hall on November  if you can make it to that.As far as the supporter section  Wow.   seats sounds like mostly safe standing.  Steepest section in the US they made the point that theyre going for the wall feeling that Dortmund has.  The eatingdrinking area behind the stand may have food trucks and local breweries.  The term German beer hall came up a few times.  Food will be LAcentric Mexican kogi etc.,LAFC,cvf8qlp,2,t5_34ahu
5452456,0,t1_cw80cgp,I think youre idea is a good Plan B or Plan C. It doesnt make LAFC itself a true club and it seems like an English model like an FC United of Manchester type thing. Remember that in the future when soccer is as popular as baseball or football is now the fans will not only include average Joes they will include the most prominent people in the city people who run large foundations trusts and universities. These same people could be entrusted to run LAFC in a noble and dignified way with a club charter bylaws etc.,LAFC,cw8lqdo,1,t5_34ahu

I expect her work to really start in  leading up to the  season. .Regarding Rich I believe Joanne was hired a couple weeks ago and I was speaking with Rich just last week. So I believe hes still there. Werent both Rich and Joanne featured in the same Guardian article?

6240396,0,t1_cyx4znt,Yeah I had a super similar experience and Portland and Seattle were the two teams I found pretty interesting which is a bit sacrilege because their rivalry is probably the most intense in MLS.

9896385,0,t1_dawmeit,USL is trying to move away from the reserve team model because sooner or later you heard it here first theyre not going to be content with being a Div  league just like they werent content with being a Div  league. At the same time owning and operating your own D affiliate is a gigantic money suck and rarely is worth it just ask FC Montreal.If our FO thinks itd be wiser to spend more money on the academy and first team rather than diverting resources to a D team no one is going to bother watching because theyre full of second stringers then I trust them on this .,LAFC,daxitu0,5,t5_34ahu
