969328,0,t1_che9z27,Thanks this is all good information.

1096389,0,t3_26lp99,Just to be the voice of calm and boringness. If you dont ride a motorbikescooter at home South east Asia Cambodia especially isnt the place to learn!!!Ive seen many accidents plus factor in how long it could take to get care if u were in an accident   hours to Cambodian hospital then an airlift to bkk  I know of it happeningIts much cheaper and more convenient to hire a tuktuk for the full day agree on a full days price at the beginning tip at the end of the day if you feel youve had good serviceOr even motodops are fine.,cambodia,chswwos,3,t5_2rk0o
1648910,0,t1_cjmxp9c,WTF Id pay at most  tops for that trip.  to  is airport route! These tuktuks have been taking you for a ride for a while it seems?You state I always negotiate maybe thats the problem. Set your fare at the beginning or at the end of the trip nonnegotiable. Itll work with some modicum of determination.Taxis arent cheaper than tuktuks and theres a vast surplus of tuktuks with respect to demand so really its a buyers market. But tuktuk drivers are skilled in talking the price up or acting all shocked and dismayed when you pay your chosen fare so yeah.. ,cambodia,cjn0bee,2,t5_2rk0o

3058259,0,t1_coex5rd,Yeah all solid advice. I feel bad about the airport. For more travelers who arent of the latter skin its long. I was able to get through the airport  minutes tops and my perma visa because one of the agents recognized I was Khmer asked me for  bucks and I went through. I honestly think if you had your paper work filled out and saw an agent idling standing you could go up to him with a  and say fast and get the paperwork done but I could be wrong. I got into a motorcycle accident crashed into an ox and luckily I walked away with just a bloody foot and left leg. Yeah at night really not safe. I go to some popular guest houses with friends and some Australian girls on vacation think that just because Khmer people are so nice during the day they can just walk home at AM. I fucking love taking motos. Its exhilarating. ,cambodia,coezhw7,3,t5_2rk0o
3512132,0,t3_30h88w,I was born in Canada to Cambodian parents who emigrated from the country in the s. Despite growing up in North American culture I also felt that plague of wanting lighter skin Im really not that dark to begin with. This came from overhearing comments from family members and friends of talking about beauty  thick silky straight hair soft white skins... No one ever told me I was ugly but I took those words in. I remember on my th or th birthday I scrubbed my skin so hard in the shower because I wanted to look lighter in time for my bday party. It was only maybe in my mids that I stopped feeling this way and started loving myself the way I am more. It wasnt an easy journey but I am much happier today when I proudly show off my tan lines and let my naturally wavy hair loose.When I lived in Cambodia I did the same thing to the local staff who were skate instructors and their students. Whenever they brought up the subject of skin colour and beauty I always tried to let them know about how somewhat silly it is of a standard and that over here in North America people actually seek to become more tan. None of them believed me.Its such a huge issue in Asia in general.,cambodia,cpslvj6,6,t5_2rk0o

3627585,0,t3_31unjg,This is an interesting and great article on the discrepancies between the two cultures comparing them pretty much in a fair light.  Id like to say the virginity culture is spot on. Its kind of okay to be a flirt but its not okay to take it any further. Despite being Khmer my sisters are very Americanized and so promiscuous scene of dating was hidden from my father. He assumes that all my sisters except the married one are virgins. Im Americanized too so its weird being in my s that he expects me to look for young  year old girls since theyre definitely virgins.   Battambang statement is accurate. The city itself has a different vibe altogether from the rest of the country. Out of all the cities Ive visited I felt safest and most comfortable there. I believe University of Battambang is one of the best school in the country. Battambang is notorious in Cambodia for having the most naturally beautiful women there. Its like being Florida except with the sluttiness in the U.S.  The whole Khmer men have a hard time with Western womens individuality is absolutely true and it saddens me since its easier for a traditionally reared Khmer women to absorb Western ideals about women than traditional men to absorb Western hypermasculine values. Women are also the financiers of the household managing the finances and everso popular out house business western and eastern South Korean Chinese Japanese values also dictate that income is the sole indicator of attraction and wealth. While Khmer men do contribute earnings to the household the level of mutual respect for a mens worth despite their monetary income is declining since money is solely what developed countries values base as masculine. Khmer men are extremely insecure about their income and put girls out of their mind altogether because they dont meet the expectations they put on themselves. If they do get to that point to look for a partner their game or skills in pursuing a relationship with a girl are terrible.  The gap between womens educational attainment is bridging definitely not a bad thing but adds to Khmer mens fears when it comes to the opposite sex. One time I was in Sihanouk and I was chilling at JJs. I was with some Australians BSing around and talking with some of the girls around there. I see a group of  awkward Khmer guys standing around one of the beach tables so I decide to talk to them to test my Khmer. They asked me how to talk to white girls and were absolutely amazed by my ability just to do so. I just told them you just go up to them and make them laugh or ask a simple question. They told me the girls were pretty but scarey. Afterwards each one took a picture with me like I was some sort of celebrity. This is just one example Ive observed and encountered many even within the states of Khmer and Khmerican men having a hard time talking to the women let alone women of another race. Gossip is enormous in Cambodian culture. Ive been around it my whole life. It took me  god damn years to realize that gossiping wasnt good. Everyone lies and tries to exaggerate certain achievements. The first thing someone asks is Have you found a job? Girlfriend? or pretty much is your life going into the Khmer conceived notion of perfect? Youre expected to answer in a positive light or else you look bad. This is true for most cultures but in Khmer culture it is very severe.  Khmer people tend lie and exaggerate. There is no foul play mostly its done to put things in their life in a better light. I hate to promote this negative stereotype but they lie to themselves too. Im sure everyone does. Take everything with a grain of salt. Manipulation is the number one way of getting things done. Be wary of gifts and generous things that Khmer people give or do to you. Theyve perfected flattery and talking sweet. There may be something behind it. At least thats the way in my life. Even my group of Khmer guy friends it was prevelant you were awesome if you were the best at conning something from someone. Whether it be getting a good deal on a something stealing from the store or in video games cheatingconning your way to get better options. Manipulation tricking and conning and this adds to the cultural corruption is not viewed as morally wrong but a possible route to getting to your intended goal. At this point I consider myself the writers opposite. A traditionally reared proud Cambodian boy put into Western culture. There were so many idiosyncrasies of American culture that I just could not understand as of late because of the Khmer values I was reared with.EDIT Words,cambodia,cq5rtak,7,t5_2rk0o

4339842,0,t1_csbp9m8,Oh theres definitely pickpockets. At least here in Siem Reap and Sihanoukville there is I know because Ive seen them in action.   They travel in groups of  and are all under the age of . They will swarm you and begin asking you questions all talking at once and pulling on your hands clothes touching your arms and back. As they are laughing and shouting and firing off questions and pulling in all different directions. There will be one quiet one wholl put their hands in all your pockets and unzip your pack if youre wearing one. You wont notice this because of the chaos confusion and happy exuberance of the cute little kids.I saw at least three groups on the beach in Sihanoukville working the half drunk tourists. And in Siem Reap a group near Pub StreetSivatha RdSok San Rd area can be spotted most nights.  So if youre ever approached by a gaggle of excited children who begin touching you and pulling on you be very mindful of your stuff. ,cambodia,csetwe6,1,t5_2rk0o

4887944,0,t3_3hawez,I am a random white guy who drives a tuktuk in Phnom Penh but not commercially just to get my family around. Most people think its bizarre and hilarious many think its very cool and the vast majority of tuktuk drivers are totally cool with it once theyve checked that Im not working. But theres definitely a hint of tension when they first ask that Are you working? question.My guess is you would find your tuktuk burned out. You cant hide who you are or where you live as a barang driving a tuktuk. Everyone notices you which means anyone could find you.Having said that I know another white guy who does run a tuktuk business. He drives himself from time to time and is properly registered with the government and hasnt had any serious trouble with the locals. But he also employs Khmer staff and one other local driver and the money they earn off their business goes toward funding a free education program theyre running in the Steung Mean Chay slum. So maybe they get a pass because if people ask what the deal is he has a good story about helping the local community.,cambodia,cuanw9q,2,t5_2rk0o
