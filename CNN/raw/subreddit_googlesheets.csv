6158612,0,t1_cypmwsd,Oh okay Ive dealt with this actually. So around each IMPORTHTML you should add an IFERROR and then  repeating the  for the number of columns in the table. This way instead of returning a one column array of NA for the IMPORTHTMLs that cant be found it will return a fullwidth row of blank cells. You can then use the QUERY function on the entire set of importhtmls to remove the blank rows     queryimporthtmlsselect  where Colltgt,googlesheets,cypo5b9,2,t5_366bm

9269542,0,t1_d8qxyrl,Well I have no idea where to input the formula you wrote. Also I think you based the calculation on fps because you based the math on hrs in a day I need fps.What youve done is great because it gives me somewhat of a ballpark figure but I need exact.,googlesheets,d8qzbj8,1,t5_366bm
10911128,0,t1_de4ts99,Thank you for the reminder. I finally decided to go with the solution of having a certain amounts of columns for red and columns for green. It looks like that With this layout I just need to check how many cells between A and D for example are empty and I have my graph The code is  COUNTBLANKKT then I correct with another calculation to have the amount of filled cells ,googlesheets,de5elrr,2,t5_366bm
