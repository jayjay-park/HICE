I would suggest contacting all of the participants and seeing how many everyone wants if that ends up being more than youd originally make Id do an odd amount  x for the participants and then say  for others to order.

4937559,0,t3_3iiodu,I have a pretty large and growing collection of tapes. Most of them were acquired while thrifting. For me its threefold. The Cost  The cost cant be beat its arguably the cheapest way to acquire a physical form of an album. Plus I can go into almost any thrift shop and pick up any number of normally costly artists releases. Furthermore timing! Tapes are basically on the way out so now is a perfect time to get things like equipment and cassettes especially decks. They arent going to be making tape decks like they used to any time soon and getting them while people are practically throwing them out is a great way to build a setup.. The Unknown Its a great way to explore music. For starters you never know what youre going to find at a store and you can sift through hundreds in minutes. There are a lot of musicians I wouldnt have come across if I hadnt been open to picking up used cassettes. Artists that are almost impossible to find information or audio online. Cassettes used to be the shit and if you were releasing anything it was probably on cassette first because of their widespread use and the ease of entry for producers.. The Physical  For a lot of people like myself having a physical collection isnt about just having the best copy of an album. Its also about the journey that music has taken and the last halfcentury or so has been a pretty crazy ride but cassettes were a part of it. Its a nostalgic and increasingly foreign way to listen to music. There is a feel to putting in a cassette the smell of the deck and the sound of it clicking in place it all builds into a unique experience that is no longer a part of listening to music and is likely guaranteed to never return. Lastly Id just like to touch on your comment about quality. Cassettes are far from an ideal format but when you put a good cassette into a nice system it should sound pretty damn good. Its not like youre scratching a chalkboard and functionally speaking fast forwarding around an album is manageable on a deck with track recognition and reverse playback. Do I only want to listen to my cassettes? No it can be a pain in the ass and the quality is only downhill from here but that doesnt mean I dont revel in the experience it gives me.I hope that helps answer your question.,cassetteculture,cugx36v,6,t5_2sil0

8097703,0,t1_d4pyrjt,Cheaper yeah but youre also certainly not putting money in any artists hands if you buy secondhand. Solely buying secondhand to save money takes away a really great aspect of being into tapes in . Im talking about Bandcamp and small distros mainly though. I avoid shopping at places where tapes are sold at raised prices just because of their novelty Urban or the likes.  As far as the deck is concerned Ive got no experience with that particular model but give the head a few passes with a Qtip and alcohol. No need to break the bank on some fancy head cleaning solution. If you find that the heads get dirtied quickly degauss them degaussing tools are lt. Also Id suggest finding a tape that you know was welldubbed probably something made by a major company rather than a DIY label to check the azimuth if your player lacks vibrancy even after some cleaning.,cassetteculture,d4q96g8,7,t5_2sil0

9702403,0,t3_5dyuyj,It cascaded kind of quickly for me when an artist I liked put out an album on cassette only in . Ive always been one to look to the label when something I like comes out so I checked them out Sanity Muffin. Some of their other stuff sounded cool and for the price of a record I could order  mystery tapes. So I did and then I did again and again. I ended up buying basically their entire catalog and living in a weird haze listening to droney psychfolk at  am. Which was great. It put me in a really odd creative headspace. So now I have this connection to my tapes that reminds me of living stoned and confused at night. Kind of nostalgic now. Eventually I branched out and now have a sizable collection of tapes most of which are only available on cassette. I try to buy multipleformat releases on vinyl if I can. ,cassetteculture,da9121l,3,t5_2sil0

9993562,0,t3_5io3h7,I would use an amp to record guitar. You can do DI with the bass if youd like. Get yourself a decent pair of headphones or speakers for monitoring what youre doing. The Fostex  has pitch control I believe one of the more exciting things you can do with a tape recorder is slow things down or speed them up for weird effect. Dont worry too much about the sound quality focus more on the feel. Old track recorders are not meant to be hifi by any means. As far as drums go you might be better off using a drum machine or finding some old samples online to begin with. Also I usually run my tape deck into my recording interface so I can send and receive sounds from my computer. Opens up your options a lot.If you do end up buying a drum kit you can get some really great sounds with just a couple mics and some compression. I might recommend finding a cheap stereo rackmount compressor for experimenting with. Also make sure you have enough cables of various formats and sizes.  RCA to  Instrument cable has been especially useful for me. Last but not least have fun and keep at it!,cassetteculture,dba6tfu,1,t5_2sil0

10096951,0,t1_dbnd27g,Ive personally found the decks with soft touch buttons to be less reliable used.  Typically the belt that engages functions starts to slip and the deck no longer gets out of Play. This makes the cassette door stay locked closed and not open.Then you need to get a new flat belt harder to find to fix it.You may get different results!,cassetteculture,dbnnbaa,3,t5_2sil0

10257465,0,t1_dc6qhoa,Yep its definitely not the rca cables nor the receiver. I noticed that theres a slight hiss buzz when I adjust the left and right knobs so that might be one of the problems. ,cassetteculture,dc6qneb,3,t5_2sil0

10452639,0,t1_dcsw079,Yeah I think they are more interested in the Atlanta scene more so than just releasing lots of awesome music but its whatever weve been doing fairly well on our own. Coolest thing for me was I was able to get the tapes in all of the local record stores that carried tapes. That was pretty awesome!,cassetteculture,dcswp7q,1,t5_2sil0

11074841,0,t1_denbaue,sorry my apologies. Ive been all day trying to think of a name. Im from Miami FL and id like a more electronic sound to the label. Experimental electronic music like garage detroit sounding techno  house but not just limited to that. Lofi as well. Ill link you one of my favorite labels that i find quite inspiring. When i come up with a name or something ill definitely let you know!Music similar to this haha.  ,cassetteculture,denbnd4,2,t5_2sil0
11117376,0,t3_5yo0gy,My Denon DRM had a hardened capstan which caused the tape to be pulled sideways a bit. Since it wasnt lined up on the head anymore this produced exactly the symptoms you describe a few seconds of perfect clear sound immediately after pressing Play then fading into inaudibility.I fixed the problem by adding a layer of heatshrink tubing on top of the hardened pinch roller. The pinch roller can be removed with upwards pressure I recall it just clips in. I might be wrong so take a careful look at the pinch roller before attempting to remove it.,cassetteculture,des58y9,1,t5_2sil0

11386535,0,t1_dfm0lbd,Im from Bloomington and I feel like I should input something here. I like how they go about doing what they do more than the music or noise itself most of the time though. However they put on excellent live shows. If you dig Auris Apothecary check out Sanity Muffin.,cassetteculture,dfmn7jo,1,t5_2sil0
