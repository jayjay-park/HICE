1104604,0,t1_chtisht,Well they have a lot more room considering that the population density is really low in comparison with other European countries. From what I remember that is mainly due to historical reasons when the population of other European countries was already starting to increase Ireland actually was dealing with the famine and massive immigration actually decreasing the population. Even though the population has been rising for many years now it is still lower than it was before the famine. I just looked it up.gt The population of the island of Ireland in  was approximately . million comprising . million in the Republic of Ireland with another . million in Northern Ireland. Although this is a significant growth over recent years it is lower than historical figures.gt In  the population of the  counties which would later form the Republic of Ireland was over . million people. The Great Famine and the emigration it caused had a dramatic effect so that by  the county population had dropped by over a third to four million and by  had reduced further to three million. It held firm around three million until the early s when the population began to rise again. ,CityPorn,chtum6r,3,t5_2scjs

They are separated only by the Niagara River its about a ten minute walk across the Peace Bridge to reach the other side. With the cases of Fort Erie and Buffalo or the two cities of Niagara Falls the area around Western New York and Southern Ontario is one of the most densely populated regions on the planet with something like  million people living around the border. Between Buffalo Rochester and Toronto there is something like nine different cities that are within an hours drive of each other the two cities of Niagara Falls St. Catherines Hamilton Burlington Toronto Buffalo RochesterMississauga Lockport and Niagara on the Lake.

5692218,0,t1_cx2mmgc,Ive always figured that as the Navy reconfigured they would end up with a West Coast master Jet base at Lemoore and move the Helos there or Point Mugu. That would open up Miramar which used to and could again have  large parallel runways. Easy access of I and I a more rural location and unimpeded approaches east and west which the current airport sorely lacks. Of course the La Jolla folks would throw a fit as they wouldnt want the approach air traffic from the west....I cant even begin to imagine how big the land rush would be if the acreage the current airport sits on came available.,CityPorn,cx2oba5,6,t5_2scjs

5728043,0,t1_cx71ovt,Well its the general attitude of the inhabitants to be honest. For an example  Me and a workmate was doing some renovation work at a Supermarket in Ilkley. It got to breaktime and we were thinking of where to go for a cup of tea and a sandwich. We thought Lets go to Bettys! while were close. So we did. It was nice the staff was pleasant my sandwich was good we had a laugh with the old dears that wondered where we were working and I got a bun to take with me for later.  would recommend. Anyway fast forward a few months and Im now renovating a bank in Harrogate. Me and the same workmate thinking of where to go for dinner have the idea to go to Bettys again. Nope not this time. Everyone in the place was giving us a dirty look as soon as we walked in. The entirety of their clientele mainly middleaged or elderly women just as in Ilkley seemed to radar in on us as if they had a sixth sense for the rabble being somewhere it wasnt supposed to be. A manager nervously scooted over to see what we wanted. He was immediately snotty literally looking down his nose at us even though as a selfemployed tradey I certainly made more money than he did and really couldnt fathom why we would think we would be let in. So they wouldnt let us eat there because we had workboots on they werent even riggers just steeleys and workpants. Not a good experience.So yea the people there seem to be generally more stuck up due to an increased level of affluence. Most people in Yorkshire dont like to be associated with that trait so they say mostly with their tongue in their cheek that Harrogate is more like the South than anywhere in the North just to distance themselves from any snobbery. Although having travelled pretty much everywhere in Britain with work  in reality its not that bad. The people there arent as stuckup as my relatives in Bedford or Bath but Harrogate is where I think my relatives would move to if they ever moved up here..,CityPorn,cx74bei,8,t5_2scjs

Anyway I may have a slight bias since Im from Vancouver but...Reasons to visit Vancouver If you really like doing outdoorsy activities like hiking then Vancouver is the city for you. There are tons of hikes with different levels of difficulty that be reached using public transit. There are also lots of beaches within the city which are great in the summer. Portland still has lots of nature but it doesnt really have the same options in terms of hikes and beaches that Vancouver has.Reasons for visiting Portland If youre more into the arts eating from a huge variety of restaurants craft beer and generally more into the hipster scene then Portland does that better than Vancouver. Vancouver does have a pretty decent arts scene as well but Portland definitely does it better. That being said Ive only visited and never lived in Portland.

8970591,0,t1_d7q3if7,I find large cities full of diverse people to be comfortable and rather reassuring. There are potential friends everywhere you look yet the masses of them makes it so that you can fall back into the background and disappear when you feel like and thats really nice.And its great to have big buildings everywhere because when I look up to them I feel inspired. Its like wow damn humanity built that! Its also a visual indicator that my city is big which makes me remember that big implies vibrant which implies abundance of all kinds of societal offerings available whenever I want them.On the other hand I find it difficult to understand how small towns can be appealing. I grew up in the suburbs and remember it being boring and if you dont fit the mold of your neighborhood rather lonely. Wouldnt smaller towns be even worse?,CityPorn,d7q4nji,14,t5_2scjs

The streets and footpaths in NYC are even dirtier than Bangkok imo. The public transport system may be lacking in some parts but Uber and taxis are rampant. NYC subways are just gross.Now Im not trying to bash NYC im just trying to point out that Bangkok is definitely not the filthiest. Many parts of Bangkok and many districts are pretty clean especially now that they cleared up some street vendors. The parts that are run down are usually red light district or seedy areas which exist and have existed in NYC also.Now of course Thailand is still a developing country and some things are bound to be messy but definitely not the dirtiest or intolerably dirty.,CityPorn,dasyd22,1,t5_2scjs
