I was always obsessed with America and California and when The O.C. came out I knew I had to make it over there some day. A few years ago my ex was going to San Fran with work I got to come along. I was sooooooo excited!! Didnt realise Berkeley was so close to where we were San Mateo so I went off adventuring to go visit Berkeley its gorgeous!! I still have to go to Orange County though havent made it yet.I think for Seth because he felt his whole life that he didnt fit in in Cali he was set on going to the East Coast. Like he wanted to go off and see the rest of the world.Yeah Gossip Girl was great but lacked the humour The O.C. has. Good thing we can just rewatch the boxsets over and over again!,the_oc,cqr8u1d,1,t5_2w1mh
