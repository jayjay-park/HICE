6978155,0,t1_d17b5o1,Im sorry TommyNC for making that video and upsetting you. I feel awful about it and I hope you can forgive me.Less than  characters and still more sincere than his response. I dont need an essay just something not pulled outta his ass used as damage control. If he can dedicate three tweets to pass the buck and blame someone else he can make a proper apology.,LeafyIsHere,d17b8vz,2,t5_39nsu

7012988,1,t3_4bpjaa,The whole video was not about how Leafy is less of an asshole its about how they are both assholes. So yes they are both hypocrites I thought that was a pretty obvious theme trough out the whole video.,LeafyIsHere,d1b9qag,-3,t5_39nsu
7016197,0,t3_4bqte4,Leafys not just kind of a douche.  He is a douche and certainly shouldnt have leaked DMs.  But we can all be a bit douchey when were mad and the mad at one of your mates analogy is a bit incomplete without including the context that it is over actions could have potentially impacted his livelihood.  This is also far from the best analogy but imagine if one of your mates shittalked you to your boss and it resulted in a demotion.Perhaps its petty to sink to your foes level but I think something like this kinda warrants going a wee bit outside what is considered appropriate conduct in terms of the rules of war.  I agree the breach of privacy goes a bit too far.  But HH started it and while he may have crossed a line by leaking DMs its understandable that there will be escalation after the fact.  A punch returned thats coming to you needs to be more powerful than the original cheap shot.  If he didnt want escalation he shouldnt have instigated.When you make a living off subs a private pull your head in and be more careful about who you make videos about amongst friends would have been an appropriate professional courtesy to take before resorting to making a public denouncement video.  The only reason for taking this public was opportunism on Leafys expense.  After all what has this achieved but subs lost from both Leafy and HHs channels apart from more popcorn money for Keemstar.And dont give me this the public needs to know so we can talk about it crap.  It was already a top post on reddit.  And thanks partly to the bandwagoning the HH video fostered there hasnt been much if any nuancedhelpful discussion on whats appropriate in terms of roasting legitimately cringey content who you can target how much accountability you have for your fanbase etc.  All because HH opted to take an disingenuously extreme position rather than offer a reasonable and wellbalanced argument in order to rally outrage against cyberbullying.  All to get views and subs.  It certainly didnt generate an intelligent discourse on the subject one that might result in meaningful change because now we just have polar opposites of Leafy is a bully and HH is a hypocrite butting heads against each other and its all just a complete shitshow.,LeafyIsHere,d1bmu3v,6,t5_39nsu
7016691,0,t1_d1bojvh,That hes a little kid with a brain to match. Kids got no integrity hes a hypocrite and simply makes stupid points.  minutes of just dragging on  arguments and repeating them that could have been made in  minutes with the same amount of information. I mean shit even his apology video was selfcentered. It just baffles me how a kid like that can even be close to how popular he is. My guess is that theres just loads and loads of kids on the internet. Youre a prime example of that and hell youre his fucking mod. Should say a fair bit.,LeafyIsHere,d1bouo8,1,t5_39nsu
7018367,0,t1_d1bvm1e,That isnt even the worst part the worst part was that he just did stuff without talking to us. He even got Keem making us look bad.

I would like a single track for the desktopvideo audio and a separate track for the microphone. Instead its all just compressed into  video file.
