11603477,0,t1_dgb8xj9,Some of those HAS wins were against them without Durant. Also LeBron didnt play any games in Miami this year iirc. Either way youd think youd remember from the big three days how little the regular seasons holds on the playoffs. Your argument is kinda poor and lacking. Yes we got those wins. However the Celtics got the  seed and beat the same teams. No one considers them a real contender. Poor logic and argument that screams over the top homerism. Every logical thing points to a lottery pick being far more beneficial that the outcome we got. ,miamiheat,dgb9hy6,0,t5_2rk7x
