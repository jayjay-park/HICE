10777078,0,t1_ddrkhd4,Sounds like a good plan for becoming a vet! I bet the most competent veteran veterinarians in the field are the ones who jumped into practical experience with less schooling. I mean there are some crazy good doctors in third world countries who technically arent doctors at all but have just worked in hospitals for their whole lives and ended up being needed as extra hands in enough emergencies to end up becoming part of the medical staff. I think that was even one of the main ways of becoming a doctor like  years ago or more. So its gotta work for vets.Sorry Im high af and rambling.For some reason your uncetainty about the style of the dog tattoo made me picture it as a chest tattoo in the style of the famous Three Wolf Moon Tshirt. Who are some of your favorite Disney characters and why if thats not too boring to answer?,Mrsmeeseeks,ddrktb5,1,t5_3ia04
