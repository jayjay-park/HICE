4742507,0,t3_3fu306,Thats awesome.  Im a little worried about the quality of these cards.  I made it through one game and Im already getting peeling and minor tears.  Which isnt a huge issue except this is a game about guessing what the top card is and having cards with marks blemishes etc kind of works against that.  Also no I dont have meathooks for hands and I know how to shuffle a deck.Is anyone else having this problem or is it possibly a quality issue for a small amount of decks?,ExplodingKittens,ctsc612,1,t5_36003
4947297,0,t3_3inqu7,With  exploding kittens  people can play since one of the player wont explode and will win the round. Shuffling the first to explode back in sounds like a good plan but optimally you would need  decks or a regular and one NSFW  and mix them to play. ,ExplodingKittens,cui5atf,4,t5_36003

6653094,0,t3_46sbvi,Yes. You have  turns due to the attack. The explosion and defuse was only one turn.,ExplodingKittens,d07hk6k,6,t5_36003
10287180,0,t3_5luj8s,First and foremost I would love to see Cat Butt brought from the digital game into the full game so you have to place your cards face down in front of you and play like that until you next draw.Also if there was a way to do the Anti Shuffle so that all the kittens are on top that would be incredibleAs for personal ideas Id make a Toilet Paper Frenzy card. It would work a little like a skip card in that your turn would be over but youd have to give each player a card. If you run out of cards you draw a card to give them. If you draw a kitten you splode.Potentially a harmless skip but depending on the situation it could completely shoot you in the foot.,ExplodingKittens,dca3whw,2,t5_36003
10834686,0,t1_ddutre2,This is the only play that I play as a timed play. Any other play can be noped at any time. The  card play needs to be noped before the player grabs the discard pile not finds the card they want. This means that it is possible to nope you have to watch and know if someone has  cards they are likely to put down but its unlikely as I can put down  cards and grab the discard pile in one motion. Its an expensive play and being able to nope it at any time would be unfair.,ExplodingKittens,ddxisba,3,t5_36003
