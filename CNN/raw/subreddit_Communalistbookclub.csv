3732855,0,t3_326blm,In answering the question that went out via mod mail I would like work to change in that we try replacing it with play whenever feasible. I think that with our advances in production we could very easily provide a postscarcity society in which people dont need to struggle for their needs for survival and where people can spend more time doing what brings them joy Art games the politics of the polis etc.About The Communalist Project though. The first point that I think is particularly important is Bookchins position that the contradiction of unending growth and environmental destruction will be a more fundamental part of current struggles than the Marxian view of the tendency for the rate of profit to decline. In this we see a sort of ecological crisis theory rather than materialist. In this I think we find one of the most important parts of Bookchins analysis That future struggles will be primarily ecological struggles. I believe this makes sense and I think that a look at climate change really vindicates this point. We are after all genuinely looking at the collapse of civilisationBut contrary to the title of the article I just linked to I dont think we are in the end of history. In the Hegelian sense I think that we can continue through history guided by social ecology in the quest for freedom in an nonhierarchal rational and ecological society if we have the will to organise it.,Communalistbookclub,cqhrpr9,2,t5_37bmv
