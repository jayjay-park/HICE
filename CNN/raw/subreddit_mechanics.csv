5895867,0,t3_3w158t,I honestly dont have an answer for you. If someone comes in for anything tire related I put the car on the alignment rack and have it set the pressures perfectly. Other than that I just use the chuck and get it as close as I can. Come to think of it unless the pressures are insanely off this may be the reason. Getting the pressure perfect with a chuck is difficult at least for me. Not impossible just annoying. ,mechanics,cxshdeb,1,t5_2rqxu
6537768,0,t1_czt1os5,have you checked to see how the oil looks now? Fuel pressure issue is likely unrelated to anything in the oilserious engine damage.

7710625,0,t3_4kwwmq,I bought a pair of  Doc Marten Ironbridges  in brown. Ive worn them daily for about two months cleaning and conditioning every week. Theyve held up brilliantly. Scuffs and a few minor scrapes on the toe box are expected but the foxing hasnt lost its shape the welt stitching is still intact and Id estimate the tread has lost about    which is excellent compared to my last pair of Timberland Pros. Comfort wise they were about average out of the box. As with any genuine leather product there is a break in period which for me was about two weeks. Since then theyve been more comfortable to wear than any other shoe or boot Ive ever owned. For the first time in my career my feet dont hurt by end of shift. I tried a gel insole that Boot Barn pushed on me but it made the toe box too tight for my liking and only used them for a day. In my opinion the boots are just as comfortable without them and fit better.The soles are coated in a myriad of polymers making them resistant to oil fats gas acids and alkalis. Overkill for a shop but nice to know they wont melt when I step in brake cleaner. The factory laces are relatively solid but woven nylon will fray eventually and they do stretch when you crank on them. I played hockey for  years and learned the value of waxed laces. I swapped the factory laces out for flat waxed laces when I bought them as I do with all of my footwear and I highly recommend you give them a shot. Only drawback  theyre not waterproof. Obviously this wasnt a dealbreaker for me but if its something youd worry about a thorough mink oil treatment will fix that. Theyre about  including my fancy pants laces and I think well worth the money. Its also kinda cool when someone gives you a nod when they notice your yellow welt stitching!,mechanics,d3ina5l,2,t5_2rqxu

9048313,0,t3_543b03,First let me say that  months ago I took my car out of storage aft  years and have not changed the fluids because they still check out as good.  So having a good storage facility helps as mine was inside and climate controlled.  When checking out a car after storage the following should be checked. visual inspection for rust dust and anything that may seem ut of place. all fluids tires for visible cracks due to dry rotting after long periods of time. all functions of the car such as every control switch knob and buttons CHECK EVERYTHING.Now to check the coolant issue you should top off the fluid and let the vehicle run.  This will allow it to reach operating temperature and the coolant will then fully circulate.  Id say let it run for and hour after the fluid is topped off.I havent ever heard of AC fans but I think you might mean two black plastics electrical fans on the back of the radiator in front of the engine correct?  These fans are for pulling air through the radiator to cool the hot coolant flowing through it in order to cool the engine.  The fans should have an electric motor in the center which may be squeaking which means it may be worn.  Also check to see if it may be the other pulleys on the fron of the engine which are more likely to generate a squeaky sound.  Could be the AC clutch pulley on the compressor.As for the tire you should check the entire surface area of it for puncture due to debris like nails or screws.  Also you could get a spray bottle and mix watersoap in it and spray the tire surface with it.  If there is a leak the sprayed area will start to create bubbles.Good luck!,mechanics,d7zgnyz,1,t5_2rqxu
