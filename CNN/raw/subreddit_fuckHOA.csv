Loud parties and music garbage and pretty much anything youve ever seen an inconsiderate person do can be helped by a reasonable HOA. ,fuckHOA,d2zucrv,3,t5_3ej9f

8947185,0,t1_d7nb2l5,Theres a huge difference. I can see youre not even worth conversing with the way you discuss this already. I personally absolutely despise HoAs but the airbnb in a condo thing is where a line really should be drawn and the OP needs to realize this.  Airbnbs can absolutely destroy condo communities. Its very different from townhomes even where I think its acceptable. If youre going to string out everything I say youre being completely unreasonable to a level most HoAs get. I havent had to lock my doors my entire life and that has everything to do with the communities Im in. If my neighbor next door started taking in guests thats one thing and I lock my doors but sharing walls and common areas with an airbnb in a condo is entirely different. So fuck off mate,fuckHOA,d7nbijb,3,t5_3ej9f
