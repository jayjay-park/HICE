2127680,0,t3_2j8md2,When Im visiting family Rattlesnake mountain in TriCities area by Benton City.  I go there for the shotgun range nice clubhouse.  Ive used the  yard . range its presetup with some steel targets.  They have a riflepistol range too but I havent used that.  They also have a  yard range I checked out but also never used.  The road into the  yard range actually cuts through some hills that are under the range didnt know this the first time I went up there rounds cracking overhead was a little unsettling at first.Otherwise I go to Renton Fish and Game but again Ive only used the shotgun range.  The one round at a time in a mag turns me off from joining.For pistol I usually go to West Coast Armory as I used to work near there very nice place.,WA_guns,cla9wfn,1,t5_336oe

2291515,0,t1_cluxs0b,I agree. The most alarming aspect is not the transfer form but the potential for the start of a de facto registry due to the reporting requirement that the DoL will be notified of all transfers Additionally it has emboldened its supporters to push for more common sense restrictions as mentioned here I would not be surprised to see mag capacity limits AWB etc. to be pushed in the near future.

5513785,0,t1_cwgex1x,You do realize there are semiauto and automatic pellet guns right? Your argument is really moot in that regard.The primary activity undertaken by firearms does not negate the purpose of firearms. Of course people arent out using guns to kill people more than anything else. That would be plain stupid. It doesnt mean that firearms werent developed as weapons though. The simple fact that you use the term weapon is pretty self explanatory. Not. That. Hard.You do realize that keep roads in good shape is the most fundamental basic way of improving driving right? Keeping a predictable surface with proper markings is the very baseline of making sure people are able to follow safe driving lanes and rules. Daily driving would be a lot more dangerous if there were constant pot holes pieces of road missing no identifying signs and signals etc. Thats exactly what keeps drivers informed and aware.And lastly I always find this its to limit the availability of guns argument strange as well. Cars are owned by all sorts of people. Your average car costs WAAAAY more than your average firearm. Yet everyone is out there driving around by themselves. ,WA_guns,cwgfpxi,-3,t5_336oe

5897184,0,t1_cxsncf3,Thank you for this information. Good to hear from an FFL I appreciate it. I went ahead today due to the advice I got here an bought both at once. I always get a delay from NICS so I am used to it but I will pick them up on sat there is never actually an issue I think I must just have a common name. The owner of the shop I purchase from knows who I am and actually asked if I wanted to add the AR to my purchase he knew I was looking at it prior. I got a good deal and I know they are raising the prices so I just went ahead and followed the advice here. I find most people like yourself are pretty knowledgeable. Plus I have purchased prob  guns from this place anyway so I trust them. Bonus is they said they are doing a Christmas special free transfers for spouses for gifts if you feel like actually making the transfer though they did say married couples didnt have to. Ill prob just surprise my wife and let them transfer it in her name for free on sat. Thank you for your post I learned something had no idea that handguns were the only ones counted so to speak. I know those are always marked to the DOL but still I had no idea the feds didnt follow AR purchases. ,WA_guns,cxsnkxt,1,t5_336oe

I dont blame you for waiting a few more weeks for the difference but I would be shocked if you dont end up loving the range once youre able to go.

And federal law prevents any FFL from transferring a handgun to someone under age .Your only option right now is a family member giving you a bona fide gift. That is something they bought with their own money as a true present. Having a family member buy it for you just to get around the regulation is illegal.
