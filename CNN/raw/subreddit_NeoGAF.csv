1483263,0,t1_cj26uvv,Thanks. I Forgot to add one key component that you thankfully alluded to GAF feeds on itself and is selfsustaining. Thats what happens when there is only an illusion of debate and no actual debate between opposing ideas. Its another reason why their viewpoints seem reasonable to them but are in actuality becoming more extreme by the year.,NeoGAF,cj27aua,4,t5_2smnu

Have your daily pick of Im so offended! threads and count on them to be there under a different title tomorrow.,NeoGAF,cj5zb11,1,t5_2smnu
