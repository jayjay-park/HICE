Just dont treat it as a crutch and do all the work yourself and youll be fine. Use Wolfram to check your answer.

I was lucky and passed the dreaded . year Org.Chem exam the first time  but failed a . year advanced hydraulics class. Too bad but no problem passed the reexam a few months later. One of my friends got the same question we both failed the first time for his reexam and had to take the class again...Education is meant to tax your abilities not coddle you. ,UniversityofReddit,csekvvs,4,t5_2rqj9
