3870030,0,t3_2zunyn,You wont need a CS degree for any position other than the software developer. On that note unless your TL loves you and wants to keep you on the team its unlikely for Epic to pay for your CS classes until you get some senioritytenure with the company. Theyll keep you plenty occupied until then.I recommend talking to your IS friends about travel. It may not be what you think it is.That being said youll probably get enough bank to pay off your loans pretty quick.,epicsystems,cqxf14c,2,t5_2t7to

10142055,0,t3_5l6qb9,The monthly premium for dental insurance for a single new employee is .. This premium may change before the summer.gt do you guys think its worth paying  instead of  per month for the POS insurance as opposed to the HMO?No one can answer this question for you especially not with the limited amount of information you provided. The answer depends on your health your lifestyle your personal needs and desires and your risk tolerance among other things.If you are young you are healthy you have a lot of student loan debt you plan to get all of your medical care in Madison and you dont plan to see any specialists then the HMO is probably better.If you have several health conditions for which you frequently see specialists you are independently wealthy you plan to receive medical care all across the country and you care a lot about being able to see any specific doctor you want without worrying about which insurance network they are in then the POS plan is probably better.You can still get specialty care with the HMO its just a little harder to do so. In theory this isnt supposed to matter because the HMO is supposed to provide you with the care you needbut in practice it occasionally does matter.,epicsystems,dbtiini,4,t5_2t7to

11619941,0,t3_65s890,gt high yearly turnoverSomething like a third of new employees leave within the first year or two. The turnover drops considerably after that.gt  weeks with no overtimeAs a TS you probably wont need to work hour weeks very often. However its virtually certain that you will need to work more than  hours almost every week. Its possible that you will need to work ish hours almost every week although its also possible that you will be able to work less than that.gt inconsistent leadershipSome managers at Epic seem to have no idea what they are doing. Possibly this is because Epic routinely assigns people with virtually no work experience or management experience to management positions.gt Is Epic really this bad?Does work at Epic sometimes involve long hours and bad management? Yes.All jobs have bad parts. Obviously not everyone is miserable at Epic because thousands of people including me continue to work here.

11694609,0,t1_dgllhso,By federal law they have to give you  FMLA weeks  working days. After that its at their discretion whether to keep you on. But after those  days they can legally cut you loose right in the middle of treatment. I get it its not fair to ask my team to cover my work indefinitely. But on the other hand its pretty horrifying. One thing Id say is if anyone reading this didnt sign up for short term disability look into getting some. I thankfully did sign up when I started at Epic. It will be my only income as I take unpaid days for FMLA.,epicsystems,dglloth,4,t5_2t7to
