4568540,0,t1_ct6dzbh,Of all the books with names taken from Shakespeare Infinite Jest may be my favorite title. Its just so perfect. Like you Ive been tempted to finish the novel and then start it over again now that Im more situated with what is happening. If the books allure was DFW playing a joke on his readers it must have been a playful instructive one and not designed to be mean. It does beg the question about the relationship between the book and the film though.,InfiniteJestRG,ct6h686,1,t5_388i2
