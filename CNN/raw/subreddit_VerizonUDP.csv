7851933,0,t3_4mi1yu,The other thing you may want to do is keep the line yourself.  Put the SIM card in a MiFi and use it to replace your home internet.  If you want to keep it as a data only line you may want to put it on the mo  minute loyalty plan with UDP.  That is what I do with my extra UDP line. There is a lot written on the HoFo Verizon forum about the various MiFis G LTE modems and routers that are available for this purpose.Or you could use the Novatel T router with voice and use it as home internet with phones too.  If you wanted unlimited voice minutes you would have to move to the NW unlimited minutes single line TampT plan which with your TTD discount would be mo before taxesfees.I use about GB per month on my UDP SIM that I have in a MiFi.  Works pretty well not as fast as cable internet but it is only .mo before taxes and fees about mo after which is cheaper than what my cable option is.  And I get a subsidized phone every  years but of course you have to do one of the methods if you want to use the subsidized upgrade and keep UDP.,VerizonUDP,d3ymlgh,1,t5_3e28c
8298323,0,t1_d5dq9k6,Verizon allows you to upgrade a . UDP line on DPP and keep your UDP.  So getting a new phone on DPP is your easiest and safest option.Some people have been able to use their subsidized upgrade on their . UDP lines and keep UDP but Verizon has not officially announced that that is allowed. I posted my thoughts on that hereThere are other methods that allow you to use your subsidized upgrade and keep UDP but they all involve risk and are not as easy as just getting a phone on DPP.  The methods are outlined in the Slick Deals thread hereBut you really need to understand all of the issues and there are risks involved.  If you just want the easiest and safest method and are OK with paying full price then the DPP is the way to go. ,VerizonUDP,d5eujys,2,t5_3e28c

8423276,0,t3_4uz2z1,Throwaway just to be safe.Got the letter dated July   received on July th.  Placed multiple BBM orders for multiple lines on the same plan Not the direct Verizon UDP SKU its an unlimited plan from an acquired carrier.  I placed orders through BBM on  and received the shipping notification on  at which point all lines on my Verizon account show a contract end date of .  All phones arrived .The only hangup I had was the BBM site would give an error on each line if another line on the plan had a recent order.  I had to wait  minutes between each order before the BBM process would let me through without error.Its possible my plans SKU made it slightly easier for me than those with the direct UDP SKU but thats just a guess.I had been out of contract for multiple years prior to this buying phones through rd party vendors.,VerizonUDP,d5ug97w,5,t5_3e28c

But you dont.  L and L buy nexuses and L foolishly buys phones on DPP.  It is crazy for L to buy a phone on DPP they should be buying subsidized phones.  They are throwing away the money for no reason.Keep in mind that that if you move to the XL TVP you will only be getting the bonus data on L if you get a phone on DPP and on L if L pays off their DPP and gets another phone on DPP.  You cannot get a phone on DPP on L until Ls contract is up.Verizon will let you terminate L without an ETF if the service is poor at your house but they wont let you move it to a new plan and terminate the contract.

A package is just another name for an app. The system update app com.samsung.sdm runs periodically and checks for updates. If an update is found you get that notification. If you disable the app or the com.samsung.sdm package it wont run and you wont get that notification. If you want to check for update just untick the checkbox.

9090198,0,t1_d84hf1h,Im citing technology evolution not statute. One person connected with todays LTE technology can impede other connections. One persons modern  LTE radio can now saturate a towers bandwidth. That means that abuse has to be a factor in interference on a technical level.The only way it could not be is if you deprioritize UDP users when others are trying to access Band   and that is not possible for Verizon since its explicitly prohibited in the CFR.I get your point you are arguing Verizon has to end UDP. I think the FCC has leeway in its definition of interference to allow Verizon to compete on a level playing field with the other three carriers which free from the CBlock CFR now all offer UDP.,VerizonUDP,d84htwc,1,t5_3e28c

You do not have to have a DPP to get  per line but see above  You will miss out on cheap phone upgrades since the new plans  dont offer yr contract pricing as in the  subsidized iPhone that you can still get now to lock your contract in vs. the  full priced iPhone that you can finance   APR for  months ,VerizonUDP,ddaez6p,1,t5_3e28c

11600186,0,t1_dgamvoh,gt So paying roughly . before taxesfees.If you are happy with your current plans they are a better deal than new UDP.  New UDP would be  for  lines until your wifes line went off contract then it would drop to .  And of course new UDP is deprioriitized at GB.If you cant see the subsidized phone option any longer unfortunately no one has figured out a way to be able to get them if you cant see the option online.  And AFAIK if you are on an Alltel plan you cant get a phone on DPP without the system trying to change your plan to a new Verizon plan.
