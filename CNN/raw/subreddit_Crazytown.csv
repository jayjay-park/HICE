Would that not make you by definition a sociopath? To have no emotional response to the actions words or opinions of others? What are we paid for? Our emotions? No. Customer service reps managers supervisors etc are expected to bend to the will of the consumer no matter how odd ridiculous or insulting the request or demand. We are conditioned to be sociopaths. Plastic grinning sociopaths. They break us strip us of our individuality and then mold us to be what they want us to be. And then if we get to the point where we rediscover our individuality we are no longer of use to them. Yes its sad. ,Crazytown,chdff9q,4,t5_2vi7m
