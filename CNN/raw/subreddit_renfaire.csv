824971,0,t3_23kekk,Usually when you see the same outfit at more than one site its a premade costume. Or its a show set from a maker like Unicorn Trading Co. They usually have a booth at most fests. The quality isnt great but wearable nonetheless.  I found a dress on eBay that has lasted me  years.  Unfortunately that seller no longer exists but there are other custom dresses well made from seamstress folk on there. You just have to read the description to see if they tailor it to you. So eBay might be a good starting point.  Not sure if that helps or not but good luck!,renfaire,cgy1u6i,2,t5_2sctx

920076,0,t1_ch8hwwg,A great way to disguise a shorter hair cut is to use a snood  Its like a hair net that you can tuck your hair into and theyre usually only  dollars or so unless they have beading.  They go beautifully with circlets french hoods tiaras or whatever else you want to wear in your hair and can be dressed up to be more noble or down to be more middle class.  ,renfaire,ch8v9yk,2,t5_2sctx
962050,0,t3_253z86,I built these with some modifications to slim it down. I also spent time at the thrift stores and purchased leg braces that could swivel.  Instead of the basic straps I bolted the base of the stilt to the leg braces for more support.  When I put them on I could relax my legs completely and the stilts would hold me up.  Sorta felt like sitting in one of those kneeling style chairs that they used to make in the s.I do not recommend doing the high heal removing the heal portion. Remember that if you are walkingstanding a LOT. the high heal portion is really hard on your legs and you will tire quickly.  Youre also putting a lot of strain on muscles you dont normally use and can cause permanent damage if youre not careful. ,renfaire,chdn779,1,t5_2sctx

1605415,0,t3_2cn9rd,You could throw a white cotton or linen shirt under that green on colder september days.  It would add a nice layered look with the white fabric underneath the green.You could even do some sort of vest with a collar on it.  If youre afraid youre looking too much like robin hood you could always throw a different color under the green instead of white.See you at the fest!,renfaire,cjhj3y9,2,t5_2sctx

4374250,0,t3_3b3rjg,A chemise should be loose as SiriusSummer stated.  Most extant chemises are nothing more than two rectangles bound at the neckline with two baggy sleeves  so a childs chemise should be fine.  However if either of you are worried about the length issue Id say go with a basic white peasant top instead.  ,renfaire,csippa6,2,t5_2sctx

8045552,0,t1_d4kb8la,I quickly checked amazon for a ballpark on what an actual metal axe would cost.  Heres the cheapest but best looking one I could find search results in amazon for Viking axeIm usually the first to advocate for buying from local artists but this should get you started.  You can always work your way up to a more complex set of gear if you continue to go.  I started dressing up in  and my first costume was from some cheap online store.  I made due with what I had being a freshly graduated college kid.  Now Ive made dressing up in garb a regular hobby... Its a slippery but fun slope youre about to venture down.  Good luck putting together your kit!  I hope you love your time dressed at the fest.  Hopefully well see you post again with an update.,renfaire,d4ke9xf,1,t5_2sctx

9594381,0,t1_d9f0dzj,Purple dye called purpura which the sumpturary laws specifically mention was not what we call purple today.  The problem was with the dye and not the color.  Purpura comes out as a sort of deep maroon  not our grape purple.   The color purple as we think of it could be achieved using a lot of different dyestuffs.   For instance our ancestors were NOT stupid.  They new about the same color theory we were all told in kindergarten.  We know they had easy access to red madder yellow weld amp saffron and blue wasnt that hard either woad amp indigo later on.  It doesnt take much to mix woad and madder dye baths to get...purple.  Or violet.  Or if they are second or third dye baths lavender.  So for purple not being used or bright colors tell it to this guy okay so hes wearing lavender and not a bright purple but his lining is hazard cone orange.,renfaire,d9vpcfm,2,t5_2sctx
