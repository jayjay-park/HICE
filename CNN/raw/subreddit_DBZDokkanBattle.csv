4663750,0,t3_3etxa2,     I spent  on it. Yes its a free mobile game where I could wait and get the same result from just playing the game but I feel that because I have been playing for a the past  weeks and really actually enjoying it and not being addicted like most people who spent money on candy crush that its alright to throw a little bit at it. Its not a bad thing. I see it as supporting the game. If say a really good game came out on ps and was free and there was a way to support it I would do that too. Now a game like Candy Crush and all those tower bulding games like Castle Clash...NO. I dont enjoy those games and dont get any good feeling while playing it. Therefore I wouldnt spend anything because I dont wanna support that.     Same goes for a game like Final Fantasy Record Keeper. Although I did play it for months I never spent anything on it because you literally pick characters that let them auto battle. There was no sense of enjoyment from it for me. Both good games I just chose to support the one I enjoy doesnt make me a bad guy.,DBZDokkanBattle,ctif65v,2,t5_384a7

4709770,0,t1_ctnp1o0,Personally I think SSR Piccolo is the BEST SSR right now even with Frieza and Trunks added to the mix.  His skill gives everyone  more attack when HP is  or below and his Passive gives everyone  defense.  I dont get all the hype around STR Goku and INT Gohan when they are limited to only  specific types.  Trunks is like a lite version of Piccolo as well as his leader skill only gives  extra attack when HP is  or below.,DBZDokkanBattle,cto7dst,1,t5_384a7

Like I kind of agree that a couple things get sort of annoying once you start playing the game repeatedly but for the most part I think  of your complaints are really exaggerated I mean... the Trunks Advices Sound Effects Attack Texts English Dub over my dead body Rainbow Spheres complaints are kind of silly IMO P . The game is supposed to be enjoyable not only for dedicated gamers but also for casual players and random Dragon Ball fans most of the things you want them to take out could be actually helfpfulamusing for those who are new to this type of games or new to gaming in general. I understand that since you understand the games mechanics you dont need to constantly receive the automatized Trunks tips the skills info when in battle or the colortype graphic at the top as a guide but believe it or not most people DO need them and theyre honestly not annoying enough to demand the possibility of simply taking them off I mean really each one of the things youre complaining about last a couple seconds... v . The only actual complaint I consider to be useful for future updates is DangerousFats one about the friend list thing if we cant add more friends then the option shouldnt pop up its sort of confusing. But when it comes to the rest of the list youve made... I think youre doing the most TBH... XD. But well if you felt like taking it off your chest I think its ok... XD ... perhaps theyll change a couple things anyways the game is constantly having minor fixes so there is a possibility that some of your complaints might be heard I doubt it though but who knows P .

5032984,0,t1_cushr4n,This is actually why Im enjoying the Japanese version more now.  Yes you can get through the game even on ZHard with just a team of good ZAwakened SRs sometimes you just want that SSR to sweeten the pot so to speak.  I mostly wanted to just try out the Japanese version so I asked for an account with Kaioken Goku but then this happenedThat just sealed the deal for me that the Japanese version is the superior one.  I obviously wont quit using my Global main due to all the effort I put in beforehand but I will focus more on my Japan account with this little revelation.  Not just because its got more stuff but it seems the SSR rate is MUCH higher there.So thats my tale of going from despair to shining hope.  Im glad I was able to get a SSR on any version and wont complain about bad luck here ever again.  Mainly because I dont have any right to anymore. P,DBZDokkanBattle,cusnz94,1,t5_384a7

Since Im the one thats interpreting it I may or may not correctly flair it depending on who else reads it.For instance I flaired the post about pulling cooler Achievement because in his title and in his text in the post it doesnt really state anything about how many he pulled or if he was trying to get Cooler. He just simply stated he got his favorite villain and was pumped. I took it as an achievement on his part not necessarily RNG.Different strokes for different folks I suppose ,DBZDokkanBattle,cuz0lvp,2,t5_384a7

The blue in SSGSS looks cool too but what drew me to it was the look of Gokus SS hairstyle since Im huge on the original Super Saiyans I like the other transformations too but first form Super Saiyan is the best in my book. I kind of have this bad feeling that if Toriyama does a SSGSS theyll have purple hair. You know mixing red and blue. I just.. I dont know. All I can do is watch. ,DBZDokkanBattle,cv2lfmb,1,t5_384a7

5122930,0,t3_3l682s,I can understand frustration to some extent but a lot of people just have the mentality that the others toys are bigger and better  something we go through when we are  years old  Dokkan Battle is a game sure for us. For Bandai its a buisness and youll have to see it as one  What happens when you give a child some new big toys? It plays with them for a while and is happy. It would be happy much longer if it didnt see new Toys in advertisements and suddenly need those other Toys.  For the little amount of people playing global AND knowing JP content JP works like a charm as advertisement. However you have to consider that the biggest share of the playerbase doesnt know about JP content they just play the game.  Giving us the best content would be a failure of Bandai to make money. With every crappy summon event they will earn money since some people cant stand the wait and will blast out someAlso they would ditch already created JP of course had everything before us content. Why should they not bring content to global which they just have to translate?The reoccuring events of course can frustrate a bit but also serve a purpose.They do enough planning as to which Event they make available and in what order.  For example You had the King Cold event thinking most players would at least get  copy of him. Shortly after you had the Bardock Event which gave you an easy route of progression With your obtained King Cold from the earlier strike youll have the best chance to get a Kid Vegeta. With the King Vegeta Strike you might get one of them aswell. These two cards enable you to get chilled and chilled enables you to get Frieza  Considering they are IntTeqAgi  This time around we had Bardock  Pikkon. Pikkon hits extremely hard and would be a sink of Items for most players. So they made chilled available again. Some people might still lack in a Teq team though since if there wasnt the chilled bug they might still have troubles. So they get the event back to obtain a TEQ gohan with super affix so it will block well for pikkon  All in all its marketing strategy and bandai puts enough thought into it. The next events are just around the corner since the gohan event doesnt last the usual amount of time,DBZDokkanBattle,cv3i6ws,5,t5_384a7
5123436,0,t1_cv3j39p,Especially the drop rates from capsules and coins. Its so stupid on global. I started a global and jpn account the same day and its ridiculous how different the accounts are.

He mentioned pokemon because defense mechanics are pretty much universal the more def you have the less damage enemy deals. The damage numbers should reflect that. Otherwise the devs did something really weird.Ill try that again on Pikkon anyway. This time making notice of the HP bar too. ,DBZDokkanBattle,cv4g4jv,1,t5_384a7

PHYgeta adds a ridiculous defense the games highest and his onhit damage reduction  which lets you reduce the damage of anyone as long as Vegeta hits before that guy in the turn.  Vegeta doesnt have to be the target he just has to hit first.  In a situation where you have multiple fights going on on a fixed health base PHYgeta might edge Gohan.

5389605,0,t1_cw0f7ft,Yeah thats why I started a jpn account. I bought an account with  SSRs to start with Vegitto and Kaio Ken Goku because I really like both of those characters. To put this in perspective my global account which has all the strike characters and the one SSR that I started the account with. Havent had terrible pulls. Some useful cards but my only SSR was SSJ Bardock which took me a full month to finally awaken because I couldnt get the medals to drop. My Japan account which has been entirely fp except for some stones I bought for stamina for the tournament has  URs and a fifth natural SSR. It would be six but Ive pulled Perfect Cell twice. Now that alone would be pretty great in terms of an account. However I also have  units that can be Dokkan awakened to eventually become URs. Oh and I have  supreme Kai and  old Kai medals left over. So thats a total of  potential UR units many of which I cant hope to get until events come back. And then today the great Saiyaman event came back which gives me the medals I need for  of my units. Now maybe my experience hasnt been normal. Maybe Im in a top percentile on Japan. But it doesnt feel that way. Japan is just miles more generous. Ive farmed almost all the map stones which was when the global account started to lose interest for me but Im still playing constantly on japan while global mostly gathers dust.

5397867,0,t3_3ox04x,I am not sure by the standards against which you measure leader skills but it seems that everything which is not all class  automatically gets an OK or bad which I consider inappropriate. For example AGL SSJ Gohans leader ability is amazing  ATK highest in global AND  HP highest in global to  types. He is the best AGL leader there is in global and even in a full  colour rainbow team it is possible that his ability will boost  or even  units given how strong STR and AGL and SSRs are for example  of the top  in your tier list are either STR or AGL which is significant. Similarly you rated Whiss  AtkHP to  classes as fairly bad  I am not sure what the justification is.  atkhp to  classes is a fairly standard SSR leader ability and is pretty solid.  Often in team building you only need to worry about boosting the top  or  characters  particularly if you subscribe to the dynamic duo school running  pairs of well linked characters and the  rotating support. As long as the leader skill boosts the dynamic duo the fact that it may not boost the other  is not significant. ,DBZDokkanBattle,cw1my2x,0,t5_384a7

If youre truly willing to farm him forget all about the other events because youll use all your stamina on that for a while. If you cant farm him without using items I also recommend holding off on farming for a while since youll be out of items before you get his SA to .     Farm Chilled on Dastardly Space Pirate.

And I probably wont waste my time on ssg goku cuz his links r better BUT his passive also has the super attack modifier. Ss goku just needs  percent health and gets almost the same boost ALWAYS. However all things considered ssgss hits harder than any other character in the game. Iv been running the mission to get android  medals and its an agi boss. When I use teq ff friezas special at sa linked to mecha frieza it does around k to k. With kamehame and super saiyan links ssgss does k and isnt type effective...his super is as hard to use but if u play conserving ur blue ki orbs then once ssgss comes out its game over.,DBZDokkanBattle,cwr2bfk,1,t5_384a7

5848582,0,t1_cxm9o1y,And whats your point? His name as it was given to him in Japan when he was first named is Coora. Does your name change when you go on holiday to another country? The joke still works as Coora is pronounced Cooler.Also you keep mentioning translation.. okay. Then we should be calling Goku Grandchild Enlightened Emptiness which is what Son Goku translates to in English.The issue is not that his name is wrong... its because you are used to  the CHANGE and dont want it corrected. If Nappa was changed to Cabba by Funimation I bet youd make exactly the opposite argument. P,DBZDokkanBattle,cxma03x,1,t5_384a7

5858550,0,t1_cxnkz2c,Heres how i am going to turn your dumb example against you.In a car you have to manually click the belt and make sure it is secure everytime you enter the car. IF you didnt bother to use the seatbelt and get ejected from the car you only have yourself to blame.In this game you should manually create a new code everyweek. IF you lose your account you only have yourself to blame. Notice that in each example personal responsibility which society is SEVERELY lacking is the key thing. Car manufacturers and Bandai gave you tools so you can ensure your own personal safety and account safety respectively they have no obligations to make you do anything. ,DBZDokkanBattle,cxnl28o,2,t5_384a7

Saiyaman would help no doubt especially if you can get either Saiyawoman with him since they link incredibly well together and she would provide a powerful UR with burning fight link.

6304281,0,t1_cz66sac,Yeah I get what you mean. It is a company after all! They need to make money but they do need to consider their player base and its concerns. My favorites are the ones who demand totally arbitrary and ludicrous numbers of stones as compensation for anything that goes wrong ever. There are tons of them on the Dokkan Battle Facebook page. Some of them demand free stones for no reason at all but those arent even funny they just make me cringe. Maintenance extended by an hour? I WANT  STONES. A singular card has a bug that doesnt even affect actual gameplay? I WANT  STONES. A card description has a typo that doesnt even misconstrue its meaning? I WANT  STONES.  Meanwhile global still hasnt received compensation for Cooler!!!!! Not that i even care anymore but its the principle of the thing PHa thats how they trick people into getting into game development and testing P I remember years ago seeing advertisements for some forprofit university making it look like game development was literally just playing video games all day and it induced so much eye rolling. ,DBZDokkanBattle,cz685cy,2,t5_384a7

Well I started and rolled Vegito Disc Summon  Got Str SSJ Goten SS Phy Goku and SS Str Vegeta... hell of a luck.. just now im also farming the gohan!The Advice given by Coenl still dont know how to link..   is really good. Try to only use stones on discount banners and guaranteed SSr banners... WT is difficult without an array of many SSRs and a low rank.. so you should defo skip the march one .. you might do Stages with your normal stamina but dont use stones! Setting yourself a limit for other banners as you mentioned gotenks is good. My plan so far is   on Dokkan Cell  on RoF and then well see where that account takes me.. Might be a lil bit less disciplined as its only an alt.. but lets see how i can do ,DBZDokkanBattle,d0qvmr7,2,t5_384a7

Hes a special unit that requires less and less Ki each time you raise his Super Attack Level. Another is a Zeni event that the boss battle has a chance of a Hercule Statue either a Bronze Silver Gold or a new Platinum worth . Million Zeni.

At this point Ive spent all story stones so my DS income is down to a trickle. Not bad but not great?This box img is a reroll that I just started. Certainly has potential and Ive spent no stones yet. I wanted the Nuker combos badly. This way I just need to friend people with the other pieces.Im kind of considering attempting to use the second account primarily for WTs just to maximize SSRs over wasted multipulls. Overall though any thoughts yea or nay towards one or the other? Anyways thanks for any feedback. I kind of like my old box but since Im out of bountiful FP stones i fear it wont be able to get much better whereas the second account oozes with potential.

Most battles can end in a few turns and that one stun could provide the extra turn you needed to end it without having to use an item. Sure phy raises dmg per super but thats more for overkill purposes since the game is saturated in damage dealers. Battles end pretty quickly if you have the hp. Unless youre talking about leader skills then yeah agl gohan is pretty bad as a leader. Team player on the other hand has better potential.

7123219,0,t1_d1nt8jx,Im not sure if youve looked at the Broly guide in the tabs up top just in case ill link it here     You have the right idea with your team but I cannot stress enough the importance of the Burning Fight link.  His hits are so much weaker when striking a teammember with the link active or the passive in Kid Trunks case.  A single kaioken or ssg goku friend can carry you through and I would drop Broly from your comp go with Paikuhan and add in a Burning Fight linker or at least another AGL.    On the turns that Broly uses his special ability the one that hits the whole team his first hit is the biggest and the rest are a percentage of the first.  Then theres his super attack which hits predictably hard.  Your Trunks cards will save your bacon.  Stuns of course can give you breathing room and a Turles friend can be good too for that reason My easiest runs were using double Turles though they tended to be long too since I was prioritizing their supers.  I wish you luck!!!,DBZDokkanBattle,d1nts03,1,t5_384a7

7251152,0,t1_d22ee02,for cell you pretty much need to be aiming to have him stunned for as much time as possible. becasue of this you should be looking at    reliable stunners.  cell has  main challenges to get around    he hits hard and can hit  times in a turn so you need good blocking units like int . and a primarily INT team.     he regens health so a missed stun on a regen turn can cost you    turns of dmg which gives more time for point  to become a problem. turles babidi general blue kid bulma teq whis are pretty much the stunners you are looking for this fight. ,DBZDokkanBattle,d22ek48,2,t5_384a7

7434231,0,t1_d2n6v26,Not sadly. That is awesome. It sucked that SS Goku both got the same Super. It lacks identity. The Ult. Gohans all having unique ones gives them all more personality same for the SS Vegeta. I love it this way and hope they keep it! ,DBZDokkanBattle,d2n83le,1,t5_384a7
7434389,0,t1_d2n8h9k,Double Vegeta would he good against one singular enemy if you get lucky with orb placement and get those ToM fruits. Everywhere else just having two of them isnt nearly enough. Youre going to be happy for every defensesupport item that you can get. Plus the overall best setup for STR monos if you really want to implement Vegeta leads is Vegeta  Gogeta because Vegetas damage output will be a joke compared to Gogetas even with a  attack multiplier slapped on him.And Ive seen you mentioning double Vegeta with one or two advantageous typings. You might as well go rainbow with Gogeta SSJ Goku FP Frieza and SSJ Vegeta as the core and some supportswhatever around it. You have the best damage dealers and the best blockerdefensive unit to link with them.Needless to say that double Gogeta lead would win this one easily.,DBZDokkanBattle,d2n8quk,1,t5_384a7

7513453,0,t1_d2w8cfz,a bit of a read but heres my reason.                               while character like ff frieza and cooler have a nice attack boosting passive they are both at sa their ki modifier is  angel goku is  so not loosing to much there and hes at sa so his sa give  at the time of launch not to mention his links which are very common while frieza and cooler are sitting at sa so only  extra to attack at time of launch and they dont have very good links ff frieza best tech partner is golden frieza and that only for  and  he doesnt link well with cooler only ki.     coolers best tech link partner is probably super buu metamorphosis and brutal beatdownattk with frieza being second. take all of that into account and ssj goku is the better choice                   if you like i can perform sa with all  and see who hits the hardest will have to do it tomorrow when i get more stam ill probably do it on the agl burdock and ill use a diff leader other than ssgss goku so the outcome wont be skewed.,DBZDokkanBattle,d2w8q5m,1,t5_384a7

Cell got stronger through absorption which showed he needed others powers to even become a threat as Imperfect Cell was a complete joke and pretty much anyone could beat him when he first showed up. Buu got a ton of power when he was born but dont remember how that happened. I actually at least like Broly more than Frieza who really had no training as he stated in DBS before getting his Golden form which just looked really weird to me.

7653473,0,t1_d3c4d60,Whats your point on the episodes? It doesnt matter if some of the content were released before the show aired. It was their choice to rehash the movies. Im also aware that GT only had  episodes but that has no bearing on what has been released or not. I was pointing out that super already had nearly all their existing arcs released when they arent even finished with the season yet. Thats pretty damn up to date but you can disagree if you want. On the other hand are tons of GT contentcharacters that hasnt been released yet if you want to complain about Vados and Champaand tournament fighters.Im also aware of ICCardass choosing to release a lot of Super contents to cash in since every banner they had was a Super banner. Even if this isnt completely Dokkan battles goal theyve released  versions of each SSB and main characters from the first  arcs already. Thats a lot of representation for an unfinished season. GT doesnt have more than  versions of each released character in game either and has one less story event than Super.

7657850,0,t1_d3clbdp,The common denominator of all forms of pay to play is that one must pay to get in the game. You dont have to pay anything to download this game and start it. In that regard it isnt PP. But when you look at how the game functions THERE IS LITERALLY THE ABILITY TO PAY TO GET MORE PLAYS. More plays gets you a better chance to pull more and better cards. You could also call this PW. The thing is English is a broken language. Theres multiple ways to say the same thing. This is why everyone calls it being either FP or PP and not PW. Theres plenty of people on this sub alone that have poured in lots of money and not gotten great or even good cards so they dont win crap. What are they? Pay to lose? Funny enough you talk about literal definitions yet these are the literal functions pay to get more plays or dont and wait to get more plays. This game starts out as FP but once youre out of free stones it can easily become PP. And the randomness of pulls keeps it from being very PW in my eyes. Unless youre lucky. ,DBZDokkanBattle,d3cnkpp,2,t5_384a7

Which I have done no problem at all.  But to see it the other way for you youcan reach your  wins in  days and stop grinding instead of bitching about longer WT that actually help more people.  Just so you know you save stones in a longer WT because you use regen stamina to play. Each extra day with its  stamina points should save you . stones to reach  or you could use those stones to spam the prelims if you want to rank higher its your decision. You are basically bitching because a longer WT is better for the majority of people which hurts your chances of ranking higher just play more as you have no ptoblem getting your  wins a day and stop bitching.,DBZDokkanBattle,d3eoqz7,6,t5_384a7

But but but  on THIS sub with the light hearted nature we have here for anyone to take it as more than just giving someone sht would be lame. It was about a card in a mobile game. Its like someone rubbing in a pull. Ex Person A Ha! I got FPFrieza on my first single!  Person B Go play in traffic! I spent  Stones amp no FP. Person B isnt a bad human. Poor taste maybe. However it would be lame for Person A to get bent out of shape. Theres internet harassment and bullying and then theres internet humor. He shouldnt have said it  but really thats about the end of it. Nobody is trying to ruin lives here.  I doubt the recipient was really bothered by it... But if he was thats pretty lame. cents,DBZDokkanBattle,d49ic1q,1,t5_384a7

The ki trails will be the main decider how the fight will play out. First ki space gives you  and the second ki gives you  so those are essential. With this team I use Senzu Dende Baba and any item that reduces attack  for a turn or more so that I can outlast Frieza. Main thing is of course with anything luck that the stunners are set up nicely to keep Frieza at bay for as long as possible so that you can chip away slowly but surely. ,DBZDokkanBattle,d49v1bo,1,t5_384a7

7993482,0,t1_d4ej2nf,I have written it in the post but Im using Senzu Dende Ghost Usher and Baba. Piccoloteq was mostly supposed to be used as a replacement for Bulma Bunnyteq as  STR types are really important so you should only really have  TEQ type and  INT type Blueint but you still need to get past Final Form Friezaagl of course and used to block. With luck on the stun especially seeing as Piccoloteq has a stun chance you could do it but I can see why youd want to wait. You could try SSJ Gohanstr instead of Kid Gokustr which could work but supers are harder due to the lack of the ki link. If you arent particularly bothered then waiting seems like the better choice but you can keep trying for  with Gohanstr if its important to you to do it sooner. ,DBZDokkanBattle,d4ejkkc,1,t5_384a7

7994112,0,t3_4omuyi, I have around  set aside to buy stones for the Gogeta event Im not buying stones yet because I still dont have Frieza and I just know Ill spend those stones before Gogeta arrives. From there Id be investing about  hours a day in it more when Im on my  hour night shifts like i do on my current account. My current account is nothing special only been playing for about  weeks I used to main Japan but since Global is starting to catch up kinda I swapped over so this would be a very VERY welcome upgrade.Absolutely no chance of me selling that! Ive never rerolled as Ive never seen the point. Sure I may get stones to potentially get one card I want but Id lose everything I currently have admittedly not great but still.... This communitysubreddit is amazing. Im  but never lost my love for all things DBZ DB Super etc. After each Super episode this community is sounding off on the things I may have missed in the episode references I didnt pick up on or just about where they think it is going and so on. Its great to see the thoroughness of some of the threads on here.I especially love the way everyone is willing to post helpful responses to what may seem trivial questions without widespread condemnation I wont say none as you get saltiness in all walks of life. This rings true for Dokkan Battle too. I see posts all the time asking for advice on things such as a FP team to beat an event or whatever and there are usually loads of comments suggesting teams. The recent chastising of Living Ichigo wasnt without merit but I felt some people took it too far. Granted he should be crediting people correctly or indeed at all although he kinda has started to but the sheer amount of threads was just insane. The admin did a marvelous job of cleaning it up so kudos but I just felt it shouldnt have had to be done. ,DBZDokkanBattle,d4em4be,1,t5_384a7

8074054,0,t1_d4ni5ba,Its always good to max out the SAs of the free cards if you have the opportunity to do so. PHY Gohan will be a useful card for Super Strike events in the future due to his low team cost and so will the undokkaned INT Trunks. The dokkaned version of INT Trunks is an INT SSJ card which there arent many of. Much less ones that you can max to SA  for free so he is a pretty valuable card. You may not be able to get all of this done depending on how far along you are in the game but if you can this is what I would suggest. Get two INT Trunks cards to SA  and dokkan one of them then get an SA  PHY Gohan. ,DBZDokkanBattle,d4nllkh,1,t5_384a7

8077318,0,t1_d4nyfwr,I honestly dont know which is why I said I suppose. I think Bojack is the better one.Coolers passive gives him  Attack amp Defense at the start of the turn while Bojacks passive increases his attack by  when a SA is triggered. While Cooler will always gain a boost Bojacks own will only be when he does a SA so I guess thats where the advantage stems. Otherwise Bojack has more HP and Attack. Cooler has much more Defense than Bojack but you know.Bojack at least has the Big Bad Bosses link which a bunch of villains possess. I personally like Bojack better but I honestly would rate them equal if anything. They both link well with their upgraded forms.The Supreme modifier makes me think thats the reason Cooler is considered better.EDIT Coolers multiplier is  while Bojack is  btw.,DBZDokkanBattle,d4nyse4,2,t5_384a7

8108420,0,t3_4qan2k,Want to throw my  cents at something. This is in the Guide text.If a character is not included that means it is absolutely worthless to use Elder Kais on so in other words theyre in the lowest priority possible.Teq Cell is not useless to use Kais on. That is only the case if you have a SSB Teq Goku as well so youre capable of having SSB leader  a friend SSB leader.You cant come close to one shotting TUR Bosses if you leave him at SA  and are only able to use a friend SSB.I obviously wouldnt place him in Z Tier or High tier but to say its useless on him is objectively incorrect.,DBZDokkanBattle,d4rgjjl,12,t5_384a7

8111504,0,t3_4qc4m7,Hes good. His leader skill is kinda meh his links are near identical to PHY SSJ Bardock except for Pioneers of Awakening which is missing for whatever reason and his passive is actually quite good considering that the majority of the boss battles are against one single enemy.He might only deal extreme damage but he seals SAs so I guess thats still alright.Id say hes among the better prize cards,DBZDokkanBattle,d4rt178,2,t5_384a7

I finally insert whatever done here! and youre content. But then there is the part of you that just wants to live your life instead of grinding on a mobile app. But then you could just easily pass a stage that was difficult for you. Or there could be a limit on the difficultystamina that you could grind and you could just grind when you personally want to accomplish something and autobattle when you need to take care of something.TLDR Best thing would be to introduce it with some kind of limit along with it and just use it how you please since it only benefits those who did want to use it and doesnt affect the people who dont want to whatsoever.,DBZDokkanBattle,d5e4wza,1,t5_384a7

Make sure to sleep about  hours before Tournament starts. Doing this gives you the most benefit cause youll be starting off playing the WT at a early time and even those in Eastern countries will start going to sleep much earlier than you by the time you start sleeping.Being in the middle of the night means nothing when you know how to take advantage of that time.

8431390,0,t1_d5vfxe3,Not toying not even close. Goku clearly states once he lost his power that he couldve finished the fight against Kid Buu if he went all out from the start. He didnt because he wanted to give Vegeta a turn. They were toying with each other in that sense then. SSJ Gotenks is needed to do damage to Super Buu. Ultimate Gohan destroyed Super Buu. SSJ Goku did not want any part of Super Buu. SSJ Goku couldve beat Kid Buu. Super Buu is more powerful than Kid Buu. Ah see there you go UNPREDICTABILITY FACTOR. Which in turn coincides with DANGEROUS not most POWERFUL. Youre betting on the fact that Kid Buu will blow up the planet because you know if he didnt have that option Buuhan would outlast him against SSJ Vegetto. youd really take Kid Buu over Buuhan against Vegetto honestly?,DBZDokkanBattle,d5vgqhb,2,t5_384a7

8501599,0,t1_d647igz,Is that it? Alright. Challenge accepted.Support items sensu dende yemma and usher. Gogeta lead. Great saiyawoman friend or any TEQ that gives ki to Gogeta. Shes a special unit once you use her shell be available again a few hours later like  or . Try refreshing the list by doing a low stam quest but shes a good unit to have. Her and Gogeta will be your clutch players theyre responsible for victory. Her team cost is  so your team must cost  no more. So yeah. Gogeta. Cram as many TEQs as you can. Now onto battle tactics. Gogeta MUST ALWAYS attack first or second  never third. Use Ghost and Yemma for damage control. Your objective is to get Gogeta to get off... A super attack. Thats it. Everyone else on your team will do nothing but that. If youve done what I said earlier that means gogeta will attack once every  turns all day everyday. This way you know when its gogetas turn to rumble and you can prepare accordingly.  This is precisely how I beat this event using a heal or two and ghost whenever vegeta was targeting gogeta. I dont know how strong your other TEQs will be so it might be slightly more difficult. I had SSJ Vegeta Skinny and saiyawoman who all did close to k damage. And I was lucky enough to see them pull off plenty of supers. Your circumstances might turn out to be different  be prepared. Also my gogeta was sa and did k damage every time. Another way to do it is to put the free teq goku lead and use a friend Gogeta to do the dirty deed. Switch display to show SA and pick the Gogeta with the highest SA.  or higher the better. Good luck. ,DBZDokkanBattle,d649439,1,t5_384a7

The new Dokkan events are insanely difficult without getting the top tier cards and are almost not doable unless youve pulled Vegito SSBKK Goku the new Broly or SSJ Gotenks. I play Global mainly and aside from Gogeta at this point Ive been able to defeat most of the Dokkan events with a solid team that doesnt need the best cards in the game. It still provides a slight challenge and still makes the game fun rather than broken. Thats just my opinion on it dont want to start a fight or anything like that.,DBZDokkanBattle,d6c338h,1,t5_384a7

The first two phases should be easy with Gogeta and stunners. Against INT Ultimate Gohan try to continue the stun. If they fail your PHYs can block. FP Frieza and Gogeta are your main hitters.Make sure to dokkan awaken PHY Ultimate Gohan first! Then you can switch out Kami from lead and put him in put Kami as a subunit then.Now for FP Frieza.

TUR Ultimate Gohanphy  LEADER SSJ Gokuphy General Blueint Bunny Bulmateq Android str Kid GokustrFRIEND TUR Gogeta preferably SA strITEMS Senzus Dendes Ushers YemmasEveryone gets  ki upon starting up. Yet again your stunners are the MVP. THe first two phases should be easy with stunning and Gogeta and Bunny Bulma for her tanking and sealing. Against FP Frieza seal his SA with Bunny Bulma and stun him with General Blue and SSJ Goku. While stunned and sealed Gogeta and Ultimate Gohan will cause damage. Android s passives help getting supers much easier.

In addition the failed fusions can heal their HP with the candy on the field!Again try to get General Blues stun as much as possible. This will let you take less damage.

8707905,0,t1_d6u42rf,Thats the idea! You have  BrolysMajin Vegetas so that you WILL get one of them on the st turn or the nd. But it doesnt really matter if the battle goes to the nd turn cuz stunning will result in the same thing. Only difference is that after your nd turn the battle ends with BrolyMajeta but with stunning it doesnt. You still have to sit through an entire rd turn with stunning and possibly a th if you managed to not kill everyone cuz lets face it those stunners arent hard hitters. TEQ Jaco cant one shot a Janemba simple as that. His attack is shit and hes at an attribute disadvantage against a tank. So youd be using MORE time going to a TH turn. Unlike TEQ Majin Vegeta who CAN one shot Janemba and any other character.So lets compare stopping at the nd turn or stopping at the rd turn possibly th turn. Which sounds like it wastes more time?,DBZDokkanBattle,d6u4gk7,1,t5_384a7

8710458,0,t1_d6ud9hj,Well if I could recommend an alternative maybe play games with similar mechanics that you cant spend much money on. For example if its the rush of getting the card you want maybe play an mmo like Warcraft new expansion comes out this within the week and its a good time to start. Honestly I felt a ton happier when me and my guild down a mythic boss than pulling a new uber omg best ever for the next month card. other suggestions are  use a modded copy during non wt times just to be safe dont use them during they are modified sp you cant buy gems.  Put money on a iTunes or play store card and try to budget. What I did was make a paypal accout not attach any payment info and used prepaid cards every week that pays for wow dokkan and other games I play.Good luckSince wow does have micro transactions and is still a social game maybe Diablo  would be better even if you get the best item it wont always have the best stats.,DBZDokkanBattle,d6ufz11,1,t5_384a7

Georgia Tech professor Ian Bogost came up with the name cow clickers for such challengefree games that demand little more than clicking on things and eventually created the satirical Facebook game Cow Clicker an attempt to distill the social game genre down to its essence. The game became quite popular.The criticism applies to the social games genre in general though Zynga is emphasized as one of the most cynical companies.citation needed Ian Bogost has four points of criticism the concept of enframing In social games friends arent really friends they are mere resources compulsion brain hacks that exploit human psychology in order to make money optionalism the gameplay in social games is almost entirely optional. The play acts ... can be skipped by spending cash money .... Social games are games you dont have to play. and destroyed time Social games so covet our time that they abuse us while we are away from them through obligation worry and dread over missed opportunities.Minimal googling can produce more examples but it takes a little digging and Im on my way to work.

8786625,0,t3_50h1ep,Heres the thing.Buu Gohan Absorbed is being compared to the likes of Super Vegito for one reason. The leader skill.Just like people used to say Mono AGL was inferior to Mono PHY or Mono INT was better than mono TEQ back when the other leaders Ki  attack its the same situation now. Buu doesnt suck completely but compared to the other God leaders he falls short.Hes being called terrible in comparison to the other God Leaders not on a whole. He could fit easily in a Shocking Speed team and make it devastating. Mono INT didnt really need so Mich focus on HP regeneration due to the typing already being filled with a bunch of Stunners. Turles G. Blue Demigra etc.. Are all great stunning units and with all the stunning there wont be much need for all that health regening. Look at his gameplay video. Only twice or three times he had to restore health again SSJ Gotenks. And that was without a bunch of stunning and without launching SAs constantly. They didnt even use stunning units that much. Only Turles.Ill just think Buu Gohan Absorbed shouldnt have been the INT God leader.  The best INT team under that Leader Skill will obviously be Saiyans and he doesnt link wellat all with many of the INT Saiyans. But its done.I just hope Omega Shenron will be better and can actually link good with the OiaF heavy STR typing. Or that he has some insane passive.,DBZDokkanBattle,d74024m,3,t5_384a7

You want to keep cards all stunners that have a decent chance at stunning. So basically you can discard most cards that have a rare chance at stunning. Also that Broly is one of the best cards in the game once you dokkan awaken him because his super attack hits everyone.,DBZDokkanBattle,d77kfto,2,t5_384a7

9029404,0,t3_53wj0v,So what about nuke leader and passives ?  Say we have a TEC Goku SSBteq friend and a TEC Perfect Cellteq leader and say you get a full board of TEC spheres .  If I understood correctly we will first multiply Cells base atk by   .  .  Edit      .  .  and then add atk    from leader Cell     .      . gt    We dont have links because it simplifies the math and the point is in nuke calculation.  So now we apply Cell passive right ?   .  .  Edit      .  . because it is  atk     .   . gt      Now Ki multiplier bonus      .     Speaking of Ki multiplier bonus you should add that the ki multiplier only applies at max ki  lesser ki only gives .    And then SA multiplier with SA  and Max      .     SA    with leader      .      SA Max    with leader     Edit  No more doubt this calculations correct.

Then that data is all sent to dbz.space. Its all done automatically so I dont think they could be a very high level. Though I am curious how they start with so many characters.

Besides making the normal list ranking each card into tiers try making a separate category where you maybe rank the  best cards for any specific mono team explaining roles and purpose for them being ranked higher in a mono environment than an individual card environment. I think this could really help put an end to people asking which cards are great for mono teams and it would be fun to see which cards you all select for mono team tiers. Just an idea.

9682854,0,t1_da6ix73,His damage is good but doesnt compare to the top damage dealers out there and he doesnt have any utility. At SA  he deals k on the Buuhan team. With his passive Active Kid Buu deals less damage than Gohan but if you add the damage gained from the boost to his team mates it surpasses Gohans damage by quite a lot. Gohans first super damage is nothing special nowadays a lot of cards now can deal around the same or better. So you can argue that his super boosts each time he uses it. Well in todays meta there are a lot of phase changing bosses. Usually after  rounds you move onto another phase after  or  stacks and youll have to start the stack all over again. If a persons INT team is crap and they have go through many rounds of stunning and relies on Gohan to deal damage then sure hes good! Lastly Gohan is not a good fit for INT. The reason Buuhans team is great is because of the villains that help heal and debuff the team. You can make a saiyan team but it wont have the villains sustainability.

9712263,0,t1_daa8l1j,Fair enough. While the Gods are DEFINITELY worth the risk I can see the point in the GSSR banner after all those are meant for newer players. But there is another option which not only gives you a GSSR ticket it also allows you to spend a bunch of stones trying to get the Gods. The World Tournament. I know it can get very grindy and boring. Whats your max stamina? If its anywhere near  or  what you can do is spend  or  stones trying to get  wins in the WT. But you get around  stones from the WT itself meaning for a little bit of grinding you can potentially end up with  GSSR tickets. This way youll only have spent a few stones and got most of them back. Also while you can get multiple SSRs in the GSSR banner majority of them are now outdated. Dont get me wrong at least  of them are viable in one form or another but... Its not all sunshine there,DBZDokkanBattle,daa8v1o,2,t5_384a7

9729361,0,t1_dac01oo,I am disappointed with VB because he essentially adds nothing to the hero team and the fact that I couldnt pull him.  At the end of the day he is just another beating stick which the hero team doesnt lack. Even then he varies between ok and good. From his passive description the chance he does an extra super attack is about  and assuming he does  extra attacks all the time there is a  chance for  extra super and a  chance for . Added to the fact that his passive doesnt increase his damage he averages out to be a pretty good damage dealer not including counters.There isnt much I can add to VBs counter that you havent mentioned. In terms of risk and reward he is nowhere near SV and personally I will prefer SS Vegeta as a more defensive player. People will feel better if they think of the  damage reduction as a bonus but that doesnt change the fact that he is lacking in tanking which the hero team is not very good at.Since he is not a reliable damage dealer nor a good blocker he is at most a jack of all trades he would have been a much better addition if he can reduce damage with his super instead of being able to hit multiple times unless you put Pikkon in the team but he does lack in ki link apart from SS which VB dont have.However most importantly he does not live up to the expectations that some fans have of him since we really werent expecting his release so soon and Bandai made him underwhelming as some of us feared.,DBZDokkanBattle,daccud7,1,t5_384a7

9765579,0,t1_dags6r5,Nah  bro. Even at max SA SA cell is going to trash skinnytenks both in damage and tankiness. His stats are k higher. Id never use him as a leader if I had cell or lr goku at my disposal.  is roughly k more hp  .k attack and  defence. His leader skill is very decent if you dont have a ki and k attack card but you pay high price because the card is very weak on its own.  per orb is just awful especially that you have only gtk attack. Cells passive provides almost . greater  increase per orb while having  higher stats.  Fatenks is in a bit better spot due to superior stats and passive but Id still pick fp frieza because frieza will do triple his damage. Failed fusions are just mediocre filler units at best. You should only use them if you dont have ki k cards.Im currently using lr goku and sa gotenks friend and Im destroying gotenks event with ease. Im already at  medals. Its even easier than super vegetos event. I cant even imagine how easy it would be with double gotenks at sa. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dagtp4i,-8,t5_384a7

If you want to build a team around him black does help a lot with tankiness AND you can get him to SA for free so that helps. The new SSB Vegito also adds a TON of damage and some tankiness with his  reduced damage which isnt bad with dual broly leadRebirth Phy Picolo can add some tankiness. Phy SSJ gotenks can super seal as well as Phy Bardok to reduce damage. Phy WT screaming Majin can provide some well needed heals. By no means is it a gimp card you just need to build a little bit around him. Ill grant you that AgiIntTeq are probably the top  in that order Phys is still a very solid contender and with new cards and new rebirths always coming out the meta is constantly shifting. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dam6f89,1,t5_384a7

Everything else is kind of secondary to that. Id say wed get a better idea of if were catching up or not based on the release dates of the Dokkan banners. So if it was  months between TEQ Cell in JPNGLB  months between Gogeta  months between Vegitothat would be a better sign were closing the gap. If The difference between Godleaders and DemiGods is consistent then were not catching up. But if were getting the next set of Dokkan banners at a slightly faster rate then yeah were catching up.

9998020,0,t1_dbaqz8v,What Im about to say is purely my own opinions am just sharing so think what You will. My last dokkan fest card was Gogeta that I went and got max stats for it and after that I didnt touch any of them dokkan fest nor try to summon except the accidental TEQ Beerus banner card that I got. I tried for SV and after  multis I got nothings but  Rs and  SRs I stopped and am waiting for Buuhan banner. cause if I can get Buuhan and clear his event all other dokkan fest will be a piece of cake cause of type advantage and strength  ability of the card. Cause stamina is very important and You cannot afford to waste stamina farming for awakening medals which You dont have a  chance of winning. that being said even though I want SV badly Im going to try to get buuhan only and if I dont get him ill wait for the banner where all the gods are there so that I can try for all the god leads in  banner,DBZDokkanBattle,dbarr3q,1,t5_384a7

Shattering the limit would allow Brohan GT SS Goku and starter Goku to link exceedingly well along with Golden Warrior. Brohans rebirth stats are insanely good too!I have GF but rarely use him to tank when I run two SVs. And he doesnt link that well with the team in general. I dont want to run Godku purely because until he TURs he just... doesnt hit hard enough  Mystic Gohan can always replace Brohan or starter Goku.

You could end up well lacking damage.SSJ Vegeta should easily fill in for Yamcha with his early blocking and high stun rate however.You could still win with Whis over Mask of course. In good runs my team still has items left.Also you could easily take out Majin Vegeta for Whis instead. Majin Vegetas there because I dont have better TEQs. Whis is a stunner Majin Vegeta can stun and OiaF if anything is a negative because of SSJ Gotenks.,DBZDokkanBattle,dbh8shb,1,t5_384a7

10111433,0,t1_dbp9wa7,He isnt for monoINT and is very clearly for rainbow super. Also he is probably the hardest hitting super INT type other than conditionally Mystic Gohanint and definitely better than Vegitoint who is more preferred as Vegitoteq anyways. Plus he is opening up a new team type of Ki  and HPATKDEF  rainbow teams thanks to SSJ Gohanstr who can get  ki with links and passive in that team and Ultra Trunksphy who can get  ki with links and passive. This team type wont beat the SSB Vegitophy team because theyre just great rather than amazing units but it will be a viable team especially to those who just want something different or dont have SSB Vegitophy and other TUR super cards. Also pretty sure you can level his SA like the other Future Trunks cards which will leave pretty much all other INTs in the dust.I swear its loselose with Bandai where if they power creep people complain if they maintain the balance people complain.,DBZDokkanBattle,dbpj2ny,1,t5_384a7

After I made that mistake I learned and will never dokkan a card until after I know there isnt a way to feed it some free SAs.  I feel your pain and it is a shit lesson to learn.  I pulled Buuhan and got pretty lucky with the STR feeds only had  coin flips not work.   tries.  That being said yea it sucks cause not gonna lie if it isnt  SA on a Buuhan friend request probably not gonna get accepted.  The good news is you only have to wait like  months and you have the rest of the god leads!  I wouldnt waste my time flipping  though thats silly.  Just pull something like  STR cards and wait it out mate.  He will be maxed out in no time!,DBZDokkanBattle,dbwobai,1,t5_384a7

10459789,0,t3_5pr43n,Right now there isnt anything going on that could make things really easy. You have to work up. On the th though we are getting the Golden Frieza banner which should include SSJ Gotenks which is one of the best cards in the game. I would try and earn as many stones as you can and aim for that. If you dont mind spending some money I would recommend buying some of the bonus sales on stones as having a lot to spend gives you a better chance of getting good stuff or at the very least more stuff to work with. Coming from the One Piece game you probably understand the pulling system well!Dont try to complete everything as fast as possible. Get a fun pace going and do some events that give you cards. They can be good fill ins until you get some better ones. When I first started I got lucky and Super Vegito was out due to the Christmas banner. I ended up pulling him and decided to make a mono agl team around it. I recommend making a team around what you get.Example if you pull Godtenks SSJ Gotenks work to make a monoteq Team. Even with some notsogreat cards Godtenks will pull a lot of weight for you. If you wanna save a little more and wait the Omega Shenron banner is coming after G. Frieza and hes also a really good card.TLDR Nothing at the moment G. Frieza w Godtenks is out in  days either go for that or wait for Omega Shenron all the while completing story and events for more dragon stones.,DBZDokkanBattle,dctq15z,1,t5_384a7

10653602,0,t3_5sfv6s,I agree with OP on several points especially about tanks being more and more necessary in mono color teams but to go off your Gogeta mention we have to bear in mind that not all events are even meant to be easy to anyone when released. By setting up this huge wall in front of your already godly box it becomes a players need to have a new very powerful card not to mention cards gain their popularity this way by being known as a new savior that can handle the tough events. What we have here is an issue of the game and the players having opposing needs. For longevity a game wants the challenge to remain giving people a reason to put hours into that challenge but we need killer teams and powerful cards to turn that grind into a breeze and they need to release morr powerful cards to keep an incentive to even pull. Keeping this balance at a good point should be more carefully handled by Bamco and it makes me wish that theyd hire up some of the older accounts here for insight.    ,DBZDokkanBattle,ddeu58n,1,t5_384a7

10653808,0,t1_ddeu66h,I am a big fan of the meta now but it presents the big problem of prerequisites. Tanks are a handful of very rare cards amongst hundreds. The best leaders and hitters are equally rare. The SSR rate while heavily boosted compared to originally kind of feels like it is going to start leaving people behind more and more. SSR are the new SR but its too costly to get them unless youre paying a LOT or just super lucky. Things like the red and blue super dragon stones I see as a step towards addressing this but Im hoping theyll do more. Its no fun to not feel like you can participate in a game you sink hours into. ,DBZDokkanBattle,ddeuwsl,4,t5_384a7

10658394,0,t3_5sgwti,I picked up a Japan account shortly before Super Vegito hit Global. I bought it for nine bucks on DBZ space to give it some support and it had a Super Vegito for in case I didnt get him on Global. I did end up getting him on Global so I put that account on the back burner for months until the second year anniversary hit. I hopped back on it to try to get SS Vegeta.  I will continue to play both but the Japan account will strictly be FP. I am PP on Global and have invested too much into it for me to abandon it so I will play both simultaneously. I plan on using the Japan one to get a gauge on what is coming and to help plan out my Global account.For example I got my hands on the dupe system for the first time a couple of days ago and I can say for certain that it is the biggest game changer to be put in so far. It turns good units into great units and great units into monster. I never really knew its potential until I tried it and now that I know what its like I can prepare more for it on my Global account. I am already sorting through my units and prioritizing them. Additionally I was able to get my hands to try both Rose and SSB Vegito via friend leaders and I have adjusted my plans for their banners with the knowledge that SS will be a pretty big jump just a few months later. My situation is a little different than yours. My Global account is over a year old while yours is only  months. My advice would be carefully assess the value of your global account How much time have you put into it? How much money have you put into it? How many top tier units do you have? Can you make a team that can beat every event for the next six months? etc. If the answer to those questions is either no or not much then a jump to Japan could be permanent if you get a good start. Otherwise I would encourage you to use that Japan account to get your hands on certain units and new mechanics so that you can personally place a value assessment on them to aid your decision making and preparation on the Global account. Hope this helps.,DBZDokkanBattle,ddfbyla,1,t5_384a7

But at the same time most of the comments I saw when it came to farming were about  which I personally think was one the worst stages seeing as how you werent guaranteed anything at all and it was a waste of items or  which I used to think was the best because of the extremely high Pilaf spawn rate and lots of chances to level up characters without having to train them.  was mentioned too but it was often drowned out by the other two stages or the Wait until  comes out.

At the time they appeared im the show they were powerful and worthy opponents.  So that is a pretty bs argument to dismiss those victories.

You have to run them in their respective mono teams or run them in a hero team . You are looseing out on lots of damage potential and over k hp and also lots  of defence . This team will get murderd by probaly every dokkan event out there . Now ill tell you how i make the most out of my super str team i run ssj  goku  ssj  gt goku  ssb vegeta  super trunks  ssj goku and beerus now this team is not the optimal team but they link pretty well and hit pretty hard but i loose out on any tanking with this team .

10964871,0,t1_deaxof3,yeah he will be above average for sure but supers are still going to hurt like a mother.  Agl has a super unit who also cant block supers but he will make you pay DEARLY if he doesnt get superd through his counter attacks and agl golden freeza is an extreme who takes almost no damage if when above  even if he gets hit with a SA  STR has a unit that can absorb all attacks for nearly no damage granted with a turn restriction and an extreme unit in Omega Shenron who lowers all incoming attacks by  and he lowers enemy attack stats when he hits them with an SA so the other extreme str units around him and can stack those debuffs to really lower damage taken across the board. INT has an extreme unit that treats all incoming attacks like he has a type advantage plus he gets a decent def buff from his passive so no attack is going to do a massive amount of damage and a super unit that now links very well with THE BEST individual card in the game and gives everyone additional defense as well as a bunch to himself. its not as much as phy cooler but again hes helping the whole rotation. TEQ has extreme golden freeza a similar unit to agl golden freeza albeit with an hp restriction. This also comes with a  atk buff to end fights much quicker. Another extreme teq unit cell gains  def PER ORB GATHERED. When this gets stacked with  x  from this new eventual leader skill he will be able to block a lot of incoming damage.In a given situation each of them can or in cells case will be able to act as a true tank. Phy has no such unit unless you invest HEAVILY into the dupe system and hes not extreme. SSB Vegettos still usable in newphy but he will be nerfed.,DBZDokkanBattle,deay6ix,-1,t5_384a7
10964943,0,t3_5wl8qs,Vegeta is a strong damage dealer with Prepared for Battle and gets stronger after his upcoming Rebirth. Trunks is a great support unit also with Prepared for Battle. His  to STR types is a lot when you think about the fact that STR has some of the hardest hitting units out there.The reason you dont hear about them much is because theyre not going to appear on the optimal STR team like Omega and Gogeta. But theyre still both very solid additions.,DBZDokkanBattle,deayg5n,1,t5_384a7
10966110,0,t1_deay9ey,Extreme PHY will be viable assuming you have every one of the top Extreme PHY units including LR Ginyu. But even then it cant touch SuperSTR nor monoINT imo if you want to consider the new INT a real thing yet.Actually Ill wait till I see the calcs. He does have a decent shot at  SAs all of which can Crit. If he hits even close to Goku he could be considered better. That and his subs hit harder overall.He hits about k less than Goku linked with SSJ Goku GT GGA with free dupe upgrades so not bad by any means. A second SA means he easily out damages him. This and being a better defender puts them at least on par with each other.Should Ki not be an issue for whatever reason I dont see why ExtremePHY wouldnt be preferred over SuperSTR.,DBZDokkanBattle,deb2s45,2,t5_384a7

That being said since I started playing JP when SSBKK came out Ive seen no good reason to play GLB.  Its really far behind JP while having long periods of downtime between big events.  Knowing what events are coming is seriously overrated there is so much discussion within the community about banners that you can make sound judgements before the banners are out and have some self control.  JPs downtimes are really short if there ends up being downtime lately it has been going at a good pace.I dont think GLB needs to catch up they just need to not having this much down time between major events.  If that means leaving events up longer then do it.  I understand theyre in a bit of a mess because of licensing issues but they knew this they should have been prepared for it.

That would make a Bojack theme villian team literally unbeatable even though some are R cards. Rose supplies the ki Buuhan heals infinitely Bujin seals supers and the other  just stack debuffs to the point where supers would deal  damage.Edit Example B Warrior Gods  Atk  and reduce damage of normal atks by . Thats a pretty hefty boost for AGL SSB Goku Vegeta and Beerus.Example C Limit Breaking form   atk on super and ignores typing. Gotenks will just clean two shot everything with SSJ GT Goku on mono Hero.Example D Power Bestowed by God  Lets not even talk about that.Example E Majin Infinite Regeneration and Metamorphisis  Majin teams would be COMPLETELY op.,DBZDokkanBattle,deujr55,1,t5_384a7

The links could be a bit better his DEF buff could be a bit higher say  he could greatly lower ATK but hes honestly fine as is. I like him a lot.As for TEQ SS Goku...meh. His super is awesome hes obviously an insanely good unit and Id love to pull him when he comes around to Global where my TEQ team is actually pretty good but on JP I cant use him at all.

11219704,0,t1_df3p98d,hey I know you! Okay sit down for this one. Its a long story. In college I dabbled in the music industry. I worked with some of the biggest Hip Hop artist today back in the day when they were just starting out I even had my site on Kanyes blog roll back in the day because he loved what we did for Lupe. Anyways when I got into it I was working with a bunch of up and coming artists. With that said I was real close friends with a guy named Chris Zarou Logics current manager and he calls me up one day talking about hes going to go meet this new artist and see if he can partner up with him. Two days later he calls me and says its a done deal Logic has agreed to work with him. From there we just became friends. Logic is a hardcore gamer so literally wed just play games. I remember when The Last of Us dropped Id drive up there SOLELY so we can play through the game and just enjoy being gamers. Over time I got out of the music biz more and more but I still helped VMG on the digital marketing front whenever I could. Theyre my family and I love everyone over there.,DBZDokkanBattle,df3qmqz,49,t5_384a7

It has a restriction and its not the same for the Attack amp Defense increase. Attack is K while Defense is K. And you have to be against  or less enemies. Next thing you know they start making multiple enemy Dokkan Fes. Lol.Look at Rose he is Villains Ki support and just a flat out  increase of attack. No restriction or anything.But I agree with you.

He was one of the best pulls you could get and imo...its a long lasting meme because it actually was created with substance related to dokkan and an actual occurrence that many vets remember. Most of these new memes have no substance and are just jokes pulled from thin air with no real meaning other than a joke.

11422676,0,t1_dfqb6cz,That doesnt change as much as youd like its still just a small marginal bump for him compared to every other card because hes always getting x..  Gogeta can still get soft crits and they still stack on that x..  Moreover even his regular attacks both hit hard as hell and still force .x.Basically the crit isnt more consistent even if Gogetas second attack is not a super so half the time he gets a second attack hes still going to do about as much as a hard crit between one normal super and one normal regular and INSANELY more with double supers.  Crits are great for any card that will NOT always have maxed out type advantage and that doesnt have a debuff or buff SA.  Cards that DO have those things will probably benefit more from double hits.I have a linked question if you know would LSSJ PHY Broly get  attacks or  if AA triggers?,DBZDokkanBattle,dfqqyuw,1,t5_384a7

I actually did enjoy Super  a lot. His only flaw which is something wrong with a lot of GT was the Power Scaling. Average Android  shouldnt be able to fight Vegeta and Majuub as equals. Not at that point. Then the fusion made them stronger than both along with Gohan and Goten? Nah. I would have been fine with him actually being weaker and getting stronger after absorbing their attacks and shit. Not just being straight up better. Despite all that hes still my second favourite villain throughout the series because I have a weakness for Androids. Lol. Thats kind of sad... and true.

I didnt feel like Id ever get this unit to SA so I put my first dupe in Top Left but now Ive gone and pulled another one. Would it be worth putting kais onto this guy after the VBRose banner passes?

11524748,0,t1_dg2amru,Too many teq teams is simply a weakness of this card on its own. Kais are a weakness shared by Broly and the other Majin Vegeta. OolongsPuars as well. IMO if you have to use Golden Frieza with this card it defeats the cards main advantage over other AOE cards which is that it hypothetically allows you to AOE at high levels without having a supergimp team with the Jacoteq types. Edit In addition Him being both a lead amp an AOE is a great advantage if enough people obtain him as you can much more easily run Double Majin Vegetaagl teams like the old LSSJ Brolystr meta. The team is just Majin Majin Freind a bunch of Ki supports and maybe a few stunners and tanks. Honestly if I am not correct about him being able to be a dual ledAOE like the old Broly then there is very little reason to be excited about this unit. He certainly buffs ExAGL and makes his own MonoAGL team pretty good but without Fierce Battle that team is in a bit of doubt.,DBZDokkanBattle,dg2bywo,1,t5_384a7

So long as you manage your ki alright if you put SSJ Vegeta in the second slot and put Majin Vegeta in the first. If Rose is the third unit then he gives Majin Vegeta  ki and SSJ Vegeta FB and PFB.If SSBKK Goku is the third unit then hell just setup SSJ Vegeta so you can focus on Majin VegetaIf its Gohan then its just  ki to SSJ VegetaYoull need to play it and see how it works out. If it isnt working then youll need to take Majin Vegeta out of the primary rotation.

The other Dokkan events last for another  weeks and any medals you need to farm will show up two days out of the week once between MF and once on either Saturday or Sunday. If I were you Id farm the GT event for fruits and Hercule coins first grab the Elder Kais from the shop and then do the Dokkan fest events for VB and Rose. Then use your last week for the other halfstamina Dokkan events because by then youll have collected enough Dragon Stones from login bonuses that youll have enough to replenish STA any time you run out. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dgafrop,2,t5_384a7

11598589,0,t3_65j24m,I completely agree. As much as I appreciaterespect our mod team their perceived joy in creating a divide between the subreddit is a slight cause for concern. All the mods are saying that global is in the golden age of dokkan but when this era hit JP you were still a piece of shit it you ran mono phy. Everyone ridiculed you and the team you ran. So for those players there wasnt much that was golden about it. This game is all about perspective and the cards you possess. If this subreddit could minimize the shit posts trolling and art sorry artists I respect what you do very greatly but this is not an art subreddit posts it would be a much better place.,DBZDokkanBattle,dgapisb,5,t5_384a7
11598646,0,t3_65j24m,Im not sure Id say were doing nothing to make it better. Believe me here I dont want SSJ Goku str to be what he is. I dont think anyone who points out how hes the best enjoys the fact that hes as strong as he is just a few months ago villains were the best team in the game they did damage tanked debuffed healed it was incredible. Now the best team the best way to play this game is damage damage damage damage. The meta now is based solely exclusively on damage and every single unit released has had an attack boost Bandai is acknowledging their meta is horribly dull and boring and just adding to it. The reason that damage is the only thing that matters is because of the new God unit passives being only based on damage. Thats literally all they do. These units are the absolute best cards in the entire game and theyre built on damage alone. Its not everyone on the subreddit following Zen and Zehal like zombies although they do do that its a byproduct of the passives of the top tier units being so horribly boring. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dgapr5t,1,t5_384a7

11603138,0,t3_65ldsw,gt If we count everything else out just coming down to stats and passive after his passive Kid Buu will have an attack power of . Meanwhile with his passive in play Super Saiyan  Goku has a power of . This is without links leader skills or super attack multipliers on either side. Kid Buu outdoes SSJ Ggoku solo.Why are you so desperate to make Kid Buuint hit harder than SSj Gokustr that you make up a nonsensical comparison that favors Kid Buuint? First youre ignoring  of the actual things that go into making a unit hit hard. That makes your comparison worthless. Second even under your nonsensical way of analyzing units SSj Gokustr hits harder.Kid Buuint   x . passive    x .  ki multiplier  SSj Gokustr   x . passive    x .  ki multiplier  That  ki multiplier is an inescapable part of all units. Ignoring it makes absolutely no sense.  gt dont judge him ahead of time. You did that with PHY CoolerIm not aware of people underestimating FF Coolerphy as an individual unit. Without hours of his release people were talking about how he could potentially outdamage SSj Gokustr depending on how often his second super attack triggers.People did initially doubt his overall team since it was plagued with ki issues but that view changed quickly once Super Buuphy was released and those problems were resolved. I agree that its premature to judge extremeINTint but for a different primary reason.In the last several dokkan fests each leader has been accompanied by a completely new unit or a dokkan fest awakening of an old unit that works well on the leaders team.We cant judge extremeINTint until that unit is shown or we confirm it doesnt exist if thats the case. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dgb844u,10,t5_384a7

Think stun locks with double supers. Think supers that change orbs.Think some design to your team other than hit harder and faster than the other guy.

People think that efficiency is about time but thats only one type.For instance Mono STR and TEQ have the least productive efficiency because the rely more on items. AGL has the highest. Similarly Mono AGL are the most technical efficient because they dont rely on much micromanagement or items. So how is STR the most effficient if they only excel in one type of efficiency dynamic efficiency  time? Its not even like STR clears events x faster than AGL. Goku and Vegeta two shot most of the phases anyway.I mean Ive been saying since the release of the SSJs that AGL is the best team and Ill stick by that until something changes.

For example in NCAA football you have to pick your defensive formation and play before you see the CPUs formation and play just like in real life.  If you pick the wrong formation or play you could get burned but your skill can still ease it a little bit. Just like in Dokkan Battle.  If you dont know when theyre gonna super you can get burned but thats why I put best guys with defensive skills in spots that are being attacked or use ghosts or babas or Ox kings to mitigate damage.  Its part of the game and completely fair imo.  Im flabbergasted that so many people think this is cheating but the CPU.

11742374,0,t1_dgqy109,Well it is their choice if they want to mod the game to avoid things like slowly grinding the same stage x for gems or to just to get one of their units sa to  INT Trunks and GF grind for example. I also believe that people can choose to use mods when grinding the same thing over and over becomes boring and want to have an easier time with getting k gems for all the baba characters or if they have a rerolled account and want to do the boring story mode for the th time.Let me tell you about an experience of mine...The dokkan battlefield mode or whatever its actually called became the most mundane grind ive ever seen in this game after  only like  days of it being out. It became so boring and irritating to do that I almost completely gave up on getting LR Ginyu. And even if i did that event every day for the coming  MONTHS since getting him required SEVERAL thousands of the currency that dropped I still wouldnt have gotten him to SA ... and after realizing that I didnt even wanna look at the mode anymore. So after several days I gave in and decided to download the modded apk that even the moderators of this sub used to farm that event but alas it was not meant to be because on the same day that i downloaded the mod they removed the mode so I couldnt even test it lolWhat I wanted to say with all this was that people can have several different reasons to use modded versions of the apk to play the game. Maybe they use the insta kills  on all enemies or switch to the modded apk on specific grind fests. It does not matter for its their way to have fun with the game.

As no one has stated the dupepotential system heavily favors offense over defense dodge and to defense generally are shit stats compared to Crit Attack Double attack etc. Realistically even if you pull  Janembas you are not going to use the  elder kais on him to unlock the best dupe path and if you have spent enough to have  Janembas you probably have  other int units you are giving orbs to over him. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dgt66vo,1,t5_384a7

11780266,0,t1_dgu9roz,They could implement a trade system that would benefit us and still be viable. Also in terms of cheating no trade system will work so Im going to exclude that.They could make it so you can only trade one card for another at a time and has to be of the same value of another card. For instance say someone wanted Rose or Rose dupes and someone wanted VB and VB dupes and they are of the same value. They could trade  Rose for  VB. A lot of times we acquire cards that are rare good but not what we hoped for and someone else out there has the same problem. Everyone benefits. This would allow for more customization variety and allow people to finish up teams they have by cards they dont need.As for value do not make the assumption that I am referring to team cost or rarity but a different value to gauge the worth of the card. As not all SSRURtUR or whatever are equal in power. Also I would go indepth on the trade system because it is interesting what theyd HAVE to do but..why?Lastly they could put a  hour restriction on it a rank requirement and the account has to be so old. Also for accounts that reroll all summons done with dragon stones the account begins with nontradable or something of a similar manner. Really it would be all the cards the account acquires via from free stones starting out nontradable.Players could trade SSRs they dont want or need for something of equal value instead of Baba Shop. A massive upgrade to the game.Not a perfect idea but I put like absolutely no effort into it so take it for what it is worth. Definitely could easily make varies improvements but what is the point? They are never going to do it because they lose money.,DBZDokkanBattle,dgvbx8u,1,t5_384a7

They may need to implement more ways to get stones too from some missions. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dgvhx9v,1,t5_384a7

But other than that this is the most optimal team to have.

No man at the ends of the day you should do what you want. You can max gogeta now and if that is valuable to you thats the direction you should go. I was speaking from the standpoint of potential max output. I just know I be extremely dissatisfied if I had LR Gohan and got him to LR but didnt have his SA maxed. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dgwrbks,1,t5_384a7

11793622,0,t1_dgwtp51,I mean... I was actually going for something a bit more balanced. Like ATK  amp he gets a  increase from killing? Thats a bit busted. Especially when you consider his links. He has perfect linking partners such as Golden Frieza  Ki amp a  ATK increase amp Final Form Cooler  Ki amp a  ATK increase. I changed it to  but anything above seems kind of... Eh. Like I know we have busted cards like INT Gogeta but depending on the event it wouldnt be all that hard to get his ATK up. Especially when taking into account that it stacks as well as the fact that he also applies debuffs. ,DBZDokkanBattle,dgwuhwz,2,t5_384a7
