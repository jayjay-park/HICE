9348895,0,t3_58k3m4,gtUnfortunately the population of families able to make a living in the Ag sector is also vaporizing due to regs related to GMO seeds and USDA policies that have almost eliminated the ability of small farmers to survive.This is a factually false statement.   Farmers are actually doing better than they ever have in the past and that is largely do to AG tech.  There are no regulations related to GMO seeds that limit competition in farming or agriculture in general.I would love for you to explain your position....,JudgeNapolitano,d911gdr,2,t5_2ue32
