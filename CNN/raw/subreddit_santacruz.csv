96606,0,t3_1v53l7,Not at the wharf you dont need a fishing license to fish on any man made structure.  So we have tons of people collecting anything they can and most of the time these fish are waaaaaaaay under the legal catch size.  Not to mention the wharf has a large population of hungry sea lions.Please educate yourself on the catch size and different species of fish.  Some fish are threaten and cannot be taken ,santacruz,cepffjn,2,t5_2qonf
