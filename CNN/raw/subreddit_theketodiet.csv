A lot of people post what are essentially podcasts in video format with a static image or perhaps a slideshow but nothing beats a talking head for motivation.On the other hand yeah the quality of someone talking to a phone in their car isnt great BUT I have endured webcast video interviews with compressed audio and video that are even more irritating.
