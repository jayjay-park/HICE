1429380,0,t1_civegbk,Thanks! And there isnt a standard size. Different medium format cameras make different size photos. That being said if you get x you can use gaffers tape to psudo crop the holder to fit the smaller sizes until you find out. Chances are you can buy extra film holders later or it might just come with all of them. ,Darkroom,civg7dt,1,t5_2ryns

8708192,0,t1_d6s9hop,Hi there thank you so much for the various suggestions you have given me. You have been VERY helpful! I think the bathroom vent idea will work best because we dont want to mess with other vents as its not clear where they all go.How would the bathroom vent work? Would we cut a hole or use the small window? And would any light get through the vent into the darkroom? I would prefer a more permanent setup and one that could be used in winter as well.This way when working I can cover the main vent then let the chemical odors blow outside for half an hour before reopening the main vent. Thanks again!,Darkroom,d6u5ra1,1,t5_2ryns
9080233,0,t1_d824cgp,Thanks  I actually did this over the weekend trying FP and Rodinal. I may try to write a complete one up including the test procedures. I find it handy as hell  my stilllife setup read  stop hot for zone VIII and the developing test stops overexposed blank frame showed about  stop underdeveloped  and the highs in the still life were holding faint detail in the print totally looks like flagging my highs with a half stop net and developing N would be right on. Pretty dang amazing how well this works. And half the roll is left Ill need way fewer frames to dial stuff in so the tape tabs will give make it quick.Im not a zone system freak but the idea of optimizing the neg for minimum pushing stuff on the print extreme dodgingburning  and exposing the paper for maximum possible blacks with the idea of getting the most range from the papers contrast level  hell yeah!,Darkroom,d83aoqv,1,t5_2ryns
9221484,0,t3_561jn6,Processing color film at home is very possible but much more precision is required than with BampW developing. Specifically its very sensitive to temperature and you have to keep the temp stable within a few degrees or your colors will get wonky. Even the heat of your hand can potentially transfer through the tank and mess it up. The stuff he was describing to you was for BampW. Its technically possible to make or mix your own color developer but it would be way easiercost effective to buy premade. Ive never made my own color chemicals but from what I have read on this page it seems to be correct if you really want to dive in to it ,Darkroom,d8kw2wq,1,t5_2ryns
9239407,0,t1_d8m56h4,Normally you deal with high contrast by reducing development as you then can get normal tones in the rest of the negative rather than empty shadows from underexposure. But to reach and their own... ,Darkroom,d8n5ui4,1,t5_2ryns
9737632,0,t1_dabr8td,When did you get your bulbs and how far away do you keep them?  I just tried  different ones at several feet all fogged the paper badly after  minutes.  Dont feel like wasting paper to try different distances and times.,Darkroom,daddjaw,1,t5_2ryns
9827074,0,t1_daoejto,I live in a duplex up and down that we turned into one house someday the upstairs kitchen will be a swanky master bath  for now its a darkroom. So I use black seamless and gaff tape on the windows and I have a blackout curtain over the door just a bedroomstyle thing I got on eBay. I dont think theres any way a darkroom can be depressing though if you hang some cloth and set up some counters or tables youre not going to be thinking about the walls! I wouldnt be surprised if something like  plywood would work even better and potentially be the same cost but easier to work with and reusable.Also check this out  LED standardscrew bulb for like three bucks order it in red. They fit in any clip light or lamp and their spectrum doesnt overlap the paper spectrum. I have  up and my darkroom is like daylight. Well daylight on Mars but very bright.Myself and lots of APUG members use these with no fogging. Test them on your own paper if you go this route but man they kick all kinds of safelight ass!!!EDIT  be careful if the vent line has a dryer hooked to it  your underwear could end up smelling like fixer...,Darkroom,daohm5n,2,t5_2ryns

10801753,0,t1_ddtudr2,Ohh that sounds really interesting. I plan on doing salt prints on my enlarger sometimes and would love to see how some other people do it. Itd be really interested in some pictures of that.Thinking about it now modifying an existing enlarger seems like such an obvious choice instead of what Ive done. D,Darkroom,ddu4hrn,1,t5_2ryns

11235909,0,t3_5twjn3,Maybe a bit late but your film was double exposed. Could be eitherThe cameras advance mechanism is not advancing the film  frame at a time or you accidentally shot over a previous roll.The development looks fine. Im seeing highlights and shadows and everything in between so I dont think it had anything to do with that.Try shooting a brand new roll and taking a picture of a  for the first frame a  for the second and so on... Process it the same way you did with this one the check to see if the numbers are showing up correctly. If not you may have to have the camera checked by a repair specialist. Hope this helps.,Darkroom,df5kp6t,2,t5_2ryns
