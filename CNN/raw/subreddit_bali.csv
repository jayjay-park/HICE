3105322,0,t3_2vpv8o,dont eat terasi or krupuk udang.haha so maybe stay away from any sambal and anything served from a smaller restaurant as they will tell you ya ya to any concern you have over the ingredients. ,bali,cojv5yb,2,t5_2qsn8

5613022,0,t3_3rz7jp,No. Its  here at the hospitals in Bali if necessary. Stay away from monkeys never buy anything like food etc near them and also keep away from roaming dogs. Dogs wearing red or yellow string have been vaccinated courtesy of BAWA. Enjoy!,bali,cwsuljw,1,t5_2qsn8

7154281,0,t3_4ddtq6,Ive been to Bali x already and yes it never gets old. Id agree in a heartbeat if someone came up today asking me to go again. Your itinerary seems pretty ok except for the Nusa Dua which I agree is just a sterile resort area can probably skip it. And Gili is far so consider to rearrange that in essence of time. I went to Canggu in my last trip last week and I loved it there made me wanna drop everything and just stay there. Also consider a visit to Kintamani theres a restaurant overlooking the whole volcano which is an awesome view over lunch. Enjoy your trip avoid Kuta unless u really need to and heres some trivia for you Bali is short for kembali which means come back and thats why ppl keep coming back to Bali hehe,bali,d1rdd31,1,t5_2qsn8

7778858,0,t3_4ke5i2,If you prefer you could also get a private driver to Lovina and stop on your way up to see the local highlights from the volcano to the Bamboo village. Go to routive.com and check it out. All our drivers are trustworthy and English speakers.Im one of the founders of routive.com but I still believe it can be a great option for youCheersGabriel,bali,d3qe4ad,1,t5_2qsn8

9391896,0,t3_595dpx,not sure about hanging gardens but for most hotels in Bali you can either buy a day pass to use their facilities or if you eat lunch at their restaurant they will let you use the pool. Best to ask though just in case.,bali,d96hmsl,2,t5_2qsn8
10658489,0,t3_5sh24z,I also have a great driver we use every trip we make out there the guys a gem. Ill PM details.,bali,ddfcbag,2,t5_2qsn8

11443780,0,t3_63crdb,I was actually in Canggu the last  weeks! I recommend looking for accomodations near Old Mans Restuarant. Or just the Batu Balong road in general. My favorite evening events are always around there. It could be costly though. I stayed in a villa about  miles away and most times had to order an expensive taxi or try my luck with an Uber.,bali,dft54l0,1,t5_2qsn8
11619912,0,t3_65hpb4,Best option would be to mail the hostel directly and ask them about this situation. Check with them if they do an airport pick up and will give you some discounts. IMO it would be a late check in for the st and you can check on the nd around noon time.   ,bali,dgd4m1z,1,t5_2qsn8
