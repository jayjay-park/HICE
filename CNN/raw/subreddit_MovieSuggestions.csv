603288,0,t3_211pjx,Antichrist  Directed by Lars von Triers. Very interesting film and disturbing film.  Eastern Promises  Directed by David Cronenberg. Involves Russian organized crime and sex trafficking. Has a really great and brutal fight scene.A History of Violence  Cronenberg again and with Viggo Mortensen who was also in Eastern Promises. A familys quiet life is shattered in the aftermath of a violent incident in their town.Only God Forgives  Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling. Brutal film set in the underworld of Bangkok. This film seems not to have been as popular as Drive was but I actually prefer this one for some reason. I think because of the performance from Vithaya Pansringarm as the Thai police lieutenant. Cannibal Holocaust  Classic horror film. Every now and then a TIL will pop up about this concerning the fact that an Italian court wanted the director Ruggero Deodato to prove that the actors were still alive. They also filmed the real slaughter of several animals which many found disturbing. Evil Dead  Classic horror film from Sam Raimi.

I find I cant relish the delivery and the juiciness of his writing which I do enjoy because Im too busy playing catch up mentally and put the story together.If I know the story however its great. I love seeing how different people interpret and deliver the lines.

A great drama between two families and both the star child actors are really good. Pusher A typical Danish dark comedy with drugs and some hilarious sequences but also serious consequences for the protagonist. Flickering Lights Danish Blinkende Lygter directly translated. Four gangsters start a new life and have some fun adventures together. The Green Butchers Danish De grnne slagtere directly translated. Another dark comedy about two butchers who stumble upon a great secret recipe and become a great success. A Royal Affair Danish En kongelig affre directly translated. The story of the most influential characters behind Denmarks democratic revolution. Really nice drama. Klown Danish Klovn Clown. One of the best comedies Ive ever seen. Imagine the craziness of Borat but with a realistic plot. A Highjacking Danish Kapringen The Hijacking. Think the Danish version of Captain Phillips but this one came out a year before and has that typical international feel rather than Americanstyle drama. A Kings Game Danish Kongekabale Royal solitaire. Political thriller with journalism and corruption thrown in. Worlds Apart Danish To verdener Two worlds. Best for last in my opinion.

9372826,0,t3_58w5wa,Going to echo some of the others and say the original of course its the best one. On top of that Ill recommend one or two from each of the series. There are  runs of Godzilla movies. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla   Its colourful and very s. Maybe a little cheesy but a good fun movie. Definitely my favourite of the showa era. Its got robots and aliens and mystery. Its fun. Godzilla   Also called Return of Godzilla.  Really nice reboot of the series. Dark and solid movie. Godzilla vs King Ghidorah  Crazy time travel story that deals with the creation of Godzilla and King Ghidorah. Story might not make much sense on close inspection. But its a fun movie to watch. Godzilla X Megaguirus   Godzilla fights  insects from another dimension. A little cheesy   story focuses on the team fighting Godzilla and theyve got the usual problems working together. But the action in this one is good. The monster fight is fast and brutal unlike anything else in the series. Most of the other movies are slow and lumbering. Godzilla Mothra King Ghidorah Giant Monsters All Out Attack  A demonic Godzilla attacks Japan. The three guardian beasts fight to stop him. Story is good but not great. But this film looks great. The colours and cinematography are good. Godzillas design is my favourite of the series though hes got a bit of a pot belly and the action is good. Directed by Shusuke Kaneko of the s Gamera trilogy which you should definitely check out. Shin Godzilla  Newest film and completely unrelated to the previous films. A serious treatment of how the government would realistically handle a Godzilla attack. Most serious story theres been in a long time. Great monster designs. Fantastic effects worth seeing.,MovieSuggestions,d942m40,2,t5_2sqpa

Coen Brothers films are always reliable for excellent character journeys and growth which tonally feel like comingofage stories. Monsters Inc is also always great with so many sweet scenes featuring two guys figuring out how to take care of a young child and making it work with creative improvisation. If you want to go for REALLY goofylighthearted you could try The Brothers Solomon. Its widely regarded as Not Good but I laughed at a lot of the jokes.
