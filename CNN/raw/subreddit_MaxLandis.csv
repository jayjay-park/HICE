8103449,0,t3_4p81oj,I really hope hes directing Pokemon. Itd be really weird if he directs a remake of his dads movie. I could understand him coming onboard as a writerproducer to make sure it doesnt get fucked up but he he seems to have a disdain for remakes and reboots and hes been trying to step out of his fathers shadow.,MaxLandis,d4qwfof,2,t5_39moi

10704559,0,t3_54748z,I intended to just read a few pages and finish it later...I read the whole thing in one sitting. I thought this was a great take on the Power Rangers. I loved how he changed up some of the characters swapped a few coins around and that ending gave me chills. Now that Ive read this Im scared to see the new movie. I just wish hed write a follow up to this Id love to see how hed have the Green Ranger story play out.,MaxLandis,ddk3gc5,1,t5_39moi
