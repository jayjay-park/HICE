4754772,0,t1_ctszssb,Ive only sculpted with clay before but I will have access to a wheel at the studio. I like your concept of choosing an element to incorporate into all of the designs. It can easily cross over if I end up exploring different methods.,Ceramics,cttvulv,1,t5_2sk72

8535513,0,t1_d68elyc,None of them have glaze on their bottoms where the piece would touch the kiln shelf most of the decoration is underglaze which can go a bit glassy the higher its fired in terms of the blues and blacks. Otherwise there might be bits of glaze in the incised lines but its been wiped clean of the surface that might touch the shelf. All pieces were fired properly on their feet as the porcelain Im firing with can and will warp when given the chance even at only cone  ,Ceramics,d68i79k,1,t5_2sk72

9790891,0,t3_5fft79,Wow way to blow it out of the water. Im in love with that tea potpitcher. It seemed like you really pushed forms techniques and materials. Good on ya. ,Ceramics,dajxv43,3,t5_2sk72
10699927,0,t1_ddjj46e,Wow! Thanks for all the recommendations! This will help out for sure! I will let you know what I decide! ,Ceramics,ddjm991,1,t5_2sk72
10910854,0,t1_de5bwyk,I hope you dont take this the wrong way. I think your painting is really nice but the forms of those teapots are SO beautiful. I feel like the finish on the paint is really detracting from the overall look. Also Im concerned about the underglaze cracking amp wearing over time with all that hot water being added. There are so many cool glazes that would show off all those curves.Either way youve got some great stuff there! Id love to see a finished fired piece ,Ceramics,de5dl8u,5,t5_2sk72
11285768,0,t1_dfaeafo,I apply the underglaze when the pot is none dry also I brought my good camera to take some photos of my glazed pots. I can have some pictures up tonight! ,Ceramics,dfb84ao,1,t5_2sk72
