Next in line was the significantly shorter Motor Bungalo Junior a four model line of traditional folding canvastopped camp trailers that were priced from  to .The commercial trailers all shared the same unique sided trailer bed as the Bungalo Jr. but were equipped with far less equipment. The basic openbed Model A priced at  could be outfitted with numerous options such as a basic rack a flared rack a deluxe cattle rack a double deck an express top with rigid roof and Tufhyde nitiritecoated fabric sides and a standard top with rigid roof and rigid sides. Other commercial units included the  dumping trailer and the topoftheline  trailer with solid delivery body.A Deluxe Motor Bungalow was featured in the June  issue of Popular ScienceHitch a Bungalo to Your CarStop at the Glenmore! At regular intervals you see this sign as you tour through the country you decided to stop there. But when you arrive weary and worn you find that the Glenmore is in the heart of the city on a noisy main street or else that it is full.Glenn H. Curtiss and his brotherinlaw G. Carl Adams have solved this problem by inventing a bungalow on wheels that is attached to the automobile trailer fashion. It is wellequipped and yet not heavy enough to cause excessive strain. When you wish to sleep eat or rest you stop the car in some convenient place and move into the bungalow. There you will find a kitchen pantry a bathroom clothes and bedding lockers a table chairs and berths that will accommodate six people. The bungalow even has electric lights and running water. The windows are all properly screened and they are also provided with waterproof curtains.The bungalo is coupled to the automobile by a bar.A display ad in the June   of the Trenton Evening TimesMake Your Vacation Worth While. Take One of Our Motor Bungalows Behind Your Car to the Mountains or Seashore. Come and visit our Camp at River Road and Trenton Junction Road near Riverside Inn.Adams Trailer Corporation Garden City Long Island N.Y.An early brochure for Adamss Motor Bungalo bearing the slogan Gypsie Life Modernized included a drawing of a rigid enclosed trailer and photographs of Curtiss personal trailer. The brochure identified Adams as a designer and builder of custombuilt bodies stating that the Motor Bungalos dimensions were  ft.  in. long  ft.  in. wide and  ft.  in. tall. The Motor Bungalo as drawn looked much like Curtisss trailer from its V shaped front end to its outwardly folding beds. Inside the Motor Bungalo the brochure promised one would find felt mattresses clothes closets tan curtain partitions and bed curtains made of Pantasote a nitrite coated leather substitute. The exterior would be bronze green the interior dark oak.The sales and export office were located in Manhattan at Grand Central Palace with early trailers built at the Curtiss Engineering Corp. complex in Garden City Long Island. Construction was soon transferred to Hammondsport the September   issue of the Democrat amp Chronicle Rochester NY announced that Adams was relocating its machinery to the plant of Keuka IndustriesNEW INDUSTRY AT HAMMONDSPORTHammondsport Aug.   The machinery and material of the Adams Trailer Corporation of Garden City L. I. has been moved to this place and installed at the plant of Keuka Industries Inc. where the trailers and camp cars will be manufactured hereafter. The local company started making trailers this week. The trailer company reported that they are behind on orders now and that many persons who are traveling to southern states are buying camp cars and trailers.F. E. Brimmers Autocamping pub.  included a thorough review of the Deluxe and Junior versionsWe have found the Adams Motorbungalo a deluxe camping trailer outfit with two double spring beds and mattresses a complete kitchenette including ice box refrigerator folding kitchen table shelf holders for utensils and dishes water tank gasoline stove and plenty of room to carry all bulk food roomy wardrobe with hanger rod screened and curtained windows to the number of five and an absolutely watertight roof. Speaking of the roof this is a frame of light wood over which is placed ounce heavy oil duck and topped with Fabrikoid much like the automobile tops of the best cars. From each side of the top extend leatherette curtains or flies this giving double protection of canvas and leatherette over your head.The beds counterbalance with the roof of this outfit so that when opening the double spring beds their weight lifts up the roof and vice versa when shutting up this camp the weight of the roof in settling down helps close the beds. Although there are small adjustable braces that may be let down at each corner of the extended camp still this is not necessary under ordinary conditions so substantial is this outfit. It is braced in place securely by a foot extending down from the drawpull and by the rear step. This camp can be unhitched and completely set up in five minutes anywhere. It is automatic simplicity itself. Just step inside push out on the upright beds and as they easily swing to horizontal your camp is automatically made entire.The footsquare door that opens the kitchenette and wardrobe slips off its hinges and becomes a camp table of regular height. The kitchenette may be opened from inside or out whether you are trailing this outfit on the road and need to put in provisions or have it erected in camp. Over the kitchenette and wardrobe there is a triangularshaped shelf three feet on a side. The sides of this trailer are steel and the bottom is matched wood. The rear door has two panels a screened window and may be locked from inside or out.The hitch of the Motorbungalo is instantaneous ball and socket of the best type. Wheels are  x   inches the bearings are roller type and there are excellent steel springs. This outfit attaches to the frame of your car being secured by a rear bumper bolted by two braces to your car frame. The body is  inches wide and the sides  inches. The complete camp erected makes a shelter x feet. The complete bungalow weighs about  pounds.When on the road this outfit rides almost as high as the top of your automobile but the front end is Vshaped and hence does not necessarily give more wind resistance than a trailer packing down lower. It is a camp that you may depend upon as dustproof bugproof and dry. Recently the author and his family including the two small children slept in this outfit during a period of rainy weather that lasted over a month and all but took the joy out of autocamping. However day and night we ate lived and slept in a bonedry place inside this outfit.The Motorbungalo Junior is a lighter model made by the Adams firm folding down flat and compact but having only a canvas roofing over your head as do all other standard trailers. It has the kitchenette wardrobe space screened windows and two comfortable double spring beds. There is a curtain arrangement so that you can divide camp into two bedchambers if you like. The basic trailer is the same as for the regular Motorbungalo which was originally designed by Glenn H. Curtiss and is today manufactured in the original airplane factories of the inventor. Both styles of Motorbungalo trailers may be stripped of their camping outfits and used as a commercial trailer the year round when you dont want to camp. The body has a drop tail gate.Adams Trailer Corp. offered at least  models the topoftheline Motor Bungalo at  four Camp Trailers ranging from  to  and ten commercial trailers starting at  with dumping attachment and rising to  with solid delivery body.From,WeirdWheels,cib9e66,1,t5_31dn6
