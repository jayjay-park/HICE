25890,0,t3_1ucgue,Technically it is fully possible and healthy based on the fact that Alaska Native women who ate a keto diet naturally only animal fats meat and fish available in the arctic still managed to breast feed and have healthy children for generations. However a traditional subsistence diet in the wild is very different from a modern keto diet with bacon processed cheese and industrial meats. The state of ketosis itself doesnt hurt your baby but if you arent getting the nutrients it needs then it may be harmful. ,xxketo,cehdozf,1,t5_2u80h

Just put the thighs in a dish season with salt and pepper and any other seasoning you like and add about  tablespoon of butter on top. Bake at C. Spoon the butter over the top of the chicken every  minutes or so and increase the heat at the end to crisp up the skin. ts soooo good Can I ask why you try not to eat at work?

184980,0,t3_1w5010,Please dont beat yourself up about this I understand how insanely hard it is to break the cycle of bingeing  especially when it feels like no one understands. I found keto through my brother but its only after being on rketo that I have realised so many people had the same problem as me.When I was at my worst if I had a bad day or felt bored or just down I would impulsively run to the shop and buy packets and packets of muffins and cookies and chocolate and cakes and sit in my room and I would eat it all! Nobody would know and I had absolute control over it. I hid it from my flatmates and to anyone else I seemed completely normal but inside I was hurting so much. I was trapped in a cycle of either starving myself and feeling terrible and hungry and miserable or eating loads and then beating myself up about it. I caught my reflection in the mirror in the museum toilets about a week ago and was so upset I wasnt huge but it was about what was right and normal for me and I didnt recognise myself I didnt like seeing such an obvious change in my body. Id been thinking about going keto for a while but at that point I decided to just go for it. The only tips I can give that I feel have helped me is. Throw all the bad food out of your house if its not there its much harder to eat!. Eat loads of fat you tend to feel so much more satisfied and much less likely to binge. I think a lot of people feel like theyre eating a lot of fat but after recording everything on MFP they realise they could up it even more! . Try not to give in to sugarcarb cravings with something similar or a substitute. The less you give in and compromise for them the less you will crave them and its mental how quickly it works. Enjoy being allowed to eat so much fat it really helps  . It sounds obvious but drink loads of water not only to keep yourself hydrated but to see the initial water weightloss is a motivator I find it gets easier once you start seeing yourself shrink. Im no exprt but these are just things I can think of that helped me. But stay positive  you can do this! As soon as you start to see changes it will become easier.

309659,0,t3_1xj8jy,what works for me Eggs. Eggs for breakfast lunch snack or dinner.  always satisfies my hunger. Water. Peeing so often is a colossal pain in the ass. But it it stops me from grabbing seconds and mealtimes and habitually snacking. Tea. Im a snacker. Before keto I would grab snacks of cut fruit crackers cheese chocolate cookies etc. All at once. Before keto I would take whatever I could get my hands on to my room and eat in secret. Ugh. Now Ive forced myself to make a tea every time I feel snacky. I spent the money on some really nice teas but I find that plain peppermint tea is the best for this hands down. Being honest. Honest with myself about what Im actually putting in my mouth. But also being honest with others sorta. I havent told anyone Im doing keto but if Im offered something that doesnt fit I usually say Sorry I dont eat breadsweetssugarchips. Its annoying to say no to things that I do technically want... but I never regret it later.what doesnt work for me ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. Shit. Took me long enough to accept this one. I think I always knew but I wasnt being honest with myself. I packed away my Truvia threw away my sugarfree candies and stopped buying diet sodas. They stimulate my appetite quite a bit and also make me crave sweets SO badly that I end up on nasty binges. Maybe Ill be able to reintroduce truvia when Im at my goal but for now Im avoiding anything that tastes sweet at all like the plague. Its fucking hard but I cant be successful AND consume artificial sweeteners.  Keto substitutes. Aka keto bread keto cookies keto ice cream keto tortillas. You get the idea. My brain hears binge food. Nuts. Might introduce these again at my goal weight but for now I cant. Portioning them doesnt work when I eat all the portions at once.  Snacking. Im better off when I try to stick to meals. Ill allow myself something small between meals if Im really truly cantmakeit hungry. Otherwise snacks are a slippery slope for me.,xxketo,cfcv4av,3,t5_2u80h

One problem I foresee with me  keto is that I dont like the taste of eggs unless theyre in an omelette or a scramble. Also cuttingslicing raw meat freaks me out. Im a walking basket case!!! Im fine with everything else I just need to figure out a way to cook with whole chicken breasts or something. Im cool with bacon though.Yikes I have food issues. Haha. ,xxketo,cfg5lpa,1,t5_2u80h

You can put it in the fridgefreezer to let it set more or add some low carb ice cream too if you like that extra bit I sweetness. You can also melt chocolate and combine it with coconut oil then pour it on ice cream to make a chocolate shell on it!Im a huge sweet tooth and I seriously eat this keto mousse everyday and Ive still been shedding the kilos.

391721,0,t3_1yju30,I think it would be a better idea to do the fat fast after your trip. If you do the fast right before you will feel deprived which will likely cause you to cheat even more during the trip. Have you considered trying to stick to keto during the trip? I would imagine youd have plenty of low carb choices in Vegas.To answer your questions my energy was fine and I felt hungry quite often but it was manageable. It took vitamins the second time which helped a lot. I also made sure to have broth and spinach all three days and drank tons of water. I did it during the work week so I wasnt stuck at home wanting to raid my fridge lolSome people eat several small snacks but I had three small meals and one small snack. Just do whats easiest for you. I did not eat any plain cream cheese because that doesnt appeal to me at all but I did have macadamia nuts which are really tasty. I also had BPC egg drop soup curried cream of chicken soup alfredo with shiritaki noodles creamed spinach chocolate macadamia nut fat bombs and ham and egg cups kind of like quiche.,xxketo,cfld903,3,t5_2u80h

660688,0,t3_21pv6u,Throughout my keto journey I have had a couple of slip ups and I have struggled with similar thoughts. My best advice is to not look back and do your best and make your food decisions one decision at a time. You might have been knocked out of ketosis but if you go back to keto right away you will have negligible impacts from eating some carbs. I completely understand the fear of doing it again. I have struggled with this fear too and have found that I am more likely to continue to eat foods that are bad for me when I am eating sugar. Eating sugar makes me crave more sugar and the cycle continues.My suggestion is to be easy on yourself drink plenty of water and get plenty of rest. Wake up tomorrow and make yourself a lovely keto breakfast and do your best to keep making keto choices.,xxketo,cgfdbvy,4,t5_2u80h

Its not going to help and whatever negative selftalk that comes with it is only going to be more destructive and create a downward spiral of craving and binging. STOP. Whats done is done. Second you have  days to get back on track. Thats  days of improvement. At the very least you should be able to lose some of the water retention and youll feel more lean and have more energy by the time your vacation comes around. This alone will make you feel better and look more toned. Now. No excuses and no procrastinating! Get to it! Two weeks from now you dont want to be feeling bloated on a beach saying I wish I had started two weeks ago. Some improvement is better than none!Edit Id like to remind you of something I always try to keep in mind Your body image is more significant to you than anyone else. How often do judge or criticize how your friends look in bikinis or in general? Not that often right? Because you dont care you just want them to have fun. Other people feel the same way about you. So when you get there dont obsess just have fun and dont worry!! Theres more to life than a bathing suit.,xxketo,cgolvtz,6,t5_2u80h

773561,0,t3_230dzb,Today marks one week keto and I immediately realized that sticking to this diet is easy on weekdays but not so much on weekends. I did a great job of eating keto buffalo wings at the bar instead of pretzel sticks! but definitely went over on my carbs in wine. Sunday I had probably the worst hangover Ive ever experienced in my  years. Lesson learned the hard way  On a positive note I was able to fight through my hangover by the end of the day and prepped lunches for the week for me and my boyfriend. Crock pot chicken shredded and topped with cheddar cheese accompanied by chopped lettuce cilantro salsa and sour cream. Yum! ,xxketo,cgs7ify,1,t5_2u80h

788755,0,t1_cgtj8y7,You can do it! Starting out is the hardest part. Once youve been going for a couple weeks itll be come more natural to you. Also its common to eat more when on your period. Just search shark week in the search bar and you will see that youre not alone. Itll get better!! I think about food too..a lot. Ive been ketoing for  months now and I just use MFP to plan out my day and that satisfies my mind to know what Ill be eating. Maybe thatll work for you too?,xxketo,cgtxoq8,1,t5_2u80h

812472,0,t1_cgwh7z2,So my goals are off the top of my head ltg net carbs g protein up to g during shark week or after exercise and g fat more if Im hungry. The goals that I put into MFP are  and  calories. I almost always go over  but usually stay under  on a not hungry day. If I set it to  keto calculator result I tend to eat at maintenance which is not preferred right now. My TDEE is ish and Ill go OVER that amount a few times during my hungry weeks. I find that protein makes me feel more full than fat does so when Im hungry and havent hit g protein I eat more. I almost never say no to my hungry body and I dont beat myself up over the numbers I just try to remedy the issue the next day by getting adequate protein and calories.As for tracking I always track unless Im a dinner guest or eating out at nonchain restaurants. I think of it as having something to look back at if things go wrong. If I dont write it down I wont know what happened those  weeks. However as I said in my previous comment Id like to not track someday. Right now Im aiming for weight loss so I feel its necessary for me and its what works for me. Once I hit my first goal weight Ill reassess the tools Im using.I do believe that there is a degree of myth surrounding the calories inout dogma and that having a healthy metabolism not ruled by sugar could mean we can eat to satiety and forget the numbers altogether. But we have to heal our bodies first establish a connection with it so that we know what to do when we hear Im hungry.Also hi twin! edits because Im on my phone and long comments are hard,xxketo,cgwmrp0,1,t5_2u80h

830403,0,t3_23ld0z,Good luck!!! I actually think the opposite in terms of money and I find keto to be way cheaper than filling my cart with empty calories like chips and cookies and junk. Look for cheaper cuts of meat  shop around at different stores and when there are big sales on stuff buy in bulk when possible. This week my store has chicken breasts for . cents a lb. And new York strips on sale for . so I plan on buying enough for  weeks. Just shop around !!! Also buy more greens and buy localin season when possible that definitely helps.

887146,0,t3_249y1r,I am still somewhat in awe of the fact that I burned about  calories yesterday and only ate around .  I usually suck so much at calorie restriction but IF has been really helpful.  Its actually quite liberating to not have to spend time figuring out lunch and then adjusting dinner so my macros are all in spec.  Plus I dont have to worry about sabotaging myself with boredomcomfort eating because my entire feed window is during work MF so I only have the amount that I brought with me.  Today I slept in and woke up to chilly cloudy weather.  I have three hours of exercise to accomplish tomorrow so I might just take it easy today.  Thats another thing about IF I dont feel obligated to burn a minimum number of calories every single day and I can give myself time to recover!  Other than gushing about IF Im making a sausage and mushroom frittata today and snuggling with my kitties.  I have to make a pointed effort to chill out before work on at least a few days each week or else I end up running from one task to another from early morning to midnight when I get home or sometimes when I clock out.

Im not going to beat myself up for hiccups along the way. And Im giving myself grace for the couple weeks it takes me to get over my carb addiction.

Of course Ill get rid of those for the most part when I transition back into ketosis but for now Im happy with that. So make sure youre stocked up with goodies for yourself at home to stay on track.  Make sure youre also feeding yourself plenty of the good stuff so you know youre full. I also like to add a little flavor to my water to satisfy me as Im getting my water in!

1115568,0,t1_chv2d93,Those days are fucking terrible.  The Targets here only recently started carrying ultra tampons.  Before that I was having trouble even finding super plus and I was bleeding through those in an hour and a half.  Im too scared to try a cup at this point.  My strings are a couple centimeters long and Im really scared to snag them.  I did quite a lot of research on switching after tons of research preIUD at IUDDivas on Livejournal but I havent psyched myself up yet.Im really averse to taking medications I really only take NSAIDs when Im desperate so I usually just suffer through them.  They definitely help though.  Naproxen works best for a lot of people but it really upsets my stomach.  Feeling better than I ever did on HBC during my nonperiod weeks is worth the extra blood and cramps for me.  Also I take mg of vitamin e with mixed tocopherols every morning around the time of my period.  When Im not on my period I usually forget.  It seemed to help with the cramping and lots of people say its helped with their bleeding.  I get the  brand at WF.  Im too instantgratificationy to order supplements online and WFs vitamins are actually cheaper than those at the other stores near me.  Also a lot of people like red raspberry leaf tea supposed to help with uterine toning.  Im not a fan of the taste so the box I bought a year and a half ago is still in the cabinet.I noticed less cramping on my first keto period and that started three days after I committed.  I was shocked by how much less I bled during this period second on keto.Good luck!,xxketo,chv3l2n,2,t5_2u80h

The only reason its called PISS is because of the initial rapid water weight loss.  People then assume they are stalled but in fact are losing weight at the same pace as people on other diets.  Stalls are an overemphasized hyped concept around keto.  It makes people frustrated when it really shouldnt.  The scale often doesnt move for weeks on keto and every other diet.

1652738,0,t3_2d9j5b,Bacteria love to eat sugar. Eat a high sugarcarb diet and you make the bacteria on your teeth and gums delighted you make your acne bacteria overjoyed and things like UTIs thrive. Take the sugar away and they are not happy at all. Like most changes it can take awhile to take effect but Ive noticed a major downturn in bacteria and yeast things now that they dont have much to eat. Fat by itself is different than fat and carbs. The trigger foods you mentioned all come with a lot of carbs as well as fat. That is a factor that shouldnt be discounted. Keto can also have a normalizing effect on hormones. Many women with PCOS swear by it because of its regulating advantages. If your acne has a hormonal component it could positively impact that as well. Of course again the changes arent immediate but the trend is positive. ,xxketo,cjnhoxg,1,t5_2u80h

1689928,0,t1_cjrj5ty,Ive experimented with Veganism and raw Veganism is the best Ive ever felt in my life. Better than I feel on Keto and Keto makes me feel pretty good.Im currently choosing Keto because it offers accelerated weight loss and because its much cheaper and easier than being vegan especially raw vegan. Going out to eat and getting a full meal as a raw vegan can be a pain in the ass. On Keto I can usually find meat and a veggie side with no trouble. I can even do modified fast food. There are many different ways to eat vegan. The first time I tried being vegan I relied heavily on bread pasta and processed soyfilled packaged vegan foods. It was a nightmare and I started gaining weight and feeling ill but no dairy was great for my allergies. When I tried plant basedmostly raw Veganism it was glorious. I literally have never feel better in my life as I did then. Some people do the vegan thing and base their diet fruit and legumes and nuts. When I did it I tried to focus on vegetables and leafy greens and supplemented slightly with fruit and everything else. That felt fantastic. I love Keto but Im still not convinced that all carbs are the enemy like a lot people here seem to think. Obviously carbs kick you out of ketosis. So if you want to stay in ketosis forever watch the carbs. But I think to demonize them completely and say you should never eat them under any circumstances is extreme. When I did the slow carb diet a couple years ago it focused on protein and veggies and no carbs of the fruit rice pasta potato starchy variety. But you have to eat beans. Beans are super carby right? I ate beans and tons of protein and veggies way more than my Keto macros recommend at almost every meal on that diet and I lost more weight than Im losing on Keto. There wasnt even any calorie counting I was just eating as much as I felt I needed and consistently lost weight every week for about  months until I reached my goal and got off the diet. I could do slow carb again but I dont want to do binge days and Im sick of beans and honestly I just find the science of Keto fascinating. All our bodies are different. I personally feel like sugar and starches and processed foods and the sad are my enemy. I love what Keto is doing for me right now but I dont think its something I want to do forever. Just like OP I want to eventually attempt Veganism again. If youre bored and brave check out some raw foodists on YouTube. My favorite is dan the life regenerator. There are also a few vegan bodybuilders there who look amazing. These are some of the most insanely high energy positive lifeloving people with great skin and hair and bodies who look much younger than they are supposedly because of their diets. If youre not into Veganism they probably will seem completely off the wall nutso crazy to you. But for me at least when I say I want to eventually get back to Veganism thats what I have in mind. Tldr carbs prevent ketosis but that doesnt mean all carbs are the enemy and that eating them can lead to misery as evidenced by the variety of different and healthful diets in the world that do include carbs.,xxketo,cjs6gm4,1,t5_2u80h

Because I get motion sickness from being in them.  Without more specific information about your stats its difficult to help you figure out whats wacky. Another factor is your reproductive health do you have PCOS? That can slow weight loss a great deal. If you dont have PCOS its likely to be one of these  Youre eating too much or youre not eating enough or youre eating the wrong foods.  It could also be that youre not getting enough electrolytes or water. Chug! Chug! Chug! Drink water like its your job.  Hows the weather?

1828032,0,t3_2fhut1,Tomorrow was one of my mental blocks too. This is kind of crazy but know what helped my inertia? Brainwashing myself. I went into ketosis once for a lark freaked out and went out and kept procrastinating when I decided I wanted to go back in for the long haul.So for a few days I just chanted in my head dont do it now if you wouldnt do it tomorrow as I ate eggs and cheese and olives and spinach and prepared my bulletproof coffee. I really do think we have to drag our brain along for the ride as we go through the motions to get started on change and I shut up my brain with that mantra.,xxketo,ck9gx8x,2,t5_2u80h

Im very disciplined know Im not going over carbs and would be very surprised if I were going enough over calories to cause the slowdown. I had another stall or whatever during my second month in and I know that then I was Ketoing perfectly.Despite this because of the slowed loss I was getting ready to go back to tracking to see if I was sabotaging myself which makes me sadI love not tracking!. Then I put on some trousers I havent worn in threeish months and they were baggy enough on me as to be ridiculous. So I think Ill keep doing what Im doing.

2021057,0,t1_ckwq4g3,I dont have a food scale but I try to measure out my portions as best as I can. We do eat out at times and I make sure to always check the menu beforehand so I know exactly what ingredients are in what so I can plan out the macros for that meal. Ill always substitute a food too if it doesnt fall into something I can eat. it does limit what I can order but Im not going to give in just because were at a restaurant. Typical day is first my BPC. I use espresso a tbsp coconut oil and heavy cream. That tides me over for a few hours then it varies throughout the day. Ill either have bacon and eggs a salad with a high fatlow sugar dressing almonds chicken cooked in butter or coconut oil full fat cheese salami with cream cheese as a snack etc. I try to only eat when Im feeling absolutely hungry and I make sure not to overeat when I do. When I eat veggies Ill add butter for the fat content etc. I drink only water throughout the day and stay away from anything with fake sugar in it. I have found that there are times when I have definitely gone over my calories for the day and I actually lose a little more weight than usual so Im not sure if my macros from the calculator are wrong or if its just a fluke but definitely interesting!,xxketo,ckwqfg8,1,t5_2u80h

Are there two different challenges going on simultaneously?My goals for this week are kind of menial and mostly surround my house namely getting it ready for house guests that are arriving on Thursday. I had all these big ambitions to Clean ALL THE THINGS! over the weekend but ended up being way busier than anticipated. Also on the list is putting in an offer on a house I realize Ive been posting about this rather frequently but I AM EXCITE! I got up early drove to the house and scoped out what my normal commute would be and its only adding  minutes from where I live now which is awesome in the city of Atlanta. The house has been on the market for a little more than a month now but weve hit a tiny snag in that we might not have as much negotiating power as we thought  apparently the owner is the recently retired former CFOExecutive Vice President of Enormous Global Beverage Conglomerate so presumably hes loaded and is not financially motivated to sell the house for below the asking price which is a little high for the neighborhood.

I even have fingernails for the first time in  years.I spent  hours with a photographer this weekend and let her take over a thousand pictures of my family in various combinations and I wasnt tugging on my sweater or trying to angle my face to remove chins.

Theres a big difference between  and .Enjoying your own body and your newfound cheekbones is not vanity.  But a lot of us do feel some kind of cognitive dissonance as we lose weight.  Some times it takes the form of not being able to see the change or as in your case we see it and feel guilty about it.I think the only solution is selfgiven cognitive therapy  make it a plan to admire your cheekbones frequently and each time the guilty thoughts come up switch them out for neutral  and then happy  thoughts.

Im doing it mostly because I want to go on adventure vacations and be physically healthy enough to enjoy them.But for weight loss it can be a doubleedged sword. The metabolic gains you get from working out are minimal I think Ive seen something like  more calories a day burned by more muscle mass and the water weight gain makes it hard to ever see shortterm weight loss though firm butts and thighs might be worth it!.You are eating way too little though and thats probably why youre driving yourself crazy with hunger  are you able to meet your protein goal with that calorie limit?

Its about  calories.I think you need to count your protein grams not too much protein in avocados so my first thought would be that you might be hungry for protein and just eating the wrong foods.Protein first combined with some fats.  You dont know for sure that youre in ketosis right?  Do you remember what else you ate on avocado day?  Because thats about g net carbs  it would be interesting to know your carb count.It does take a while of strict keto to diminish the appetite  I noticed it for the first time at the end of Month  and now its kind of a barometer for me I get a little hungry right before dinner rest of the day not so much  unless I have berries which seem to have enough sugar to trigger my appetite.  ,xxketo,cma4kx8,1,t5_2u80h

Even coffee and tea have a net positive effect on  hydration but I wouldnt necessarily count them but other drinks count. gt My weight loss seems to be going so slowly in comparison to other women hereSTOP comparing yourself to other people!

3090025,0,t3_2vigil,I think for this recipe it depends on how big of a cheesecake youre making. I have a lot of different sized springform pans so Ive made big ones and little ones theyve all turned out really well! Its also a recipe that you can really play around with to customize how you want. For The Base   c. butter  c. almond meal  c. chopped walnuts or pecans  tbsp. sweetener of choiceMix that all up then grease the pan youre using. Pack it in evenly on the bottom and back at F for  minutes until it browns up a bit. Then set it aside and let it cool. Cheesy Goodness Part  packs of softened cream cheese  if youre making a big one  cup of heavy cream    c. sweetener depending on how sweet you like it Id also suggest using a powdered sweetener you dont want it to be grainy The zest of  lemons and the juice of one make sure the zest is gratedchopped finely Whip the heavy cream and set it aside. Whip the cream cheese sweetener lemon zest and juice taste to see if its both lemony and sweet enough for your taste. Fold in the whipping cream. After the base has cooled put the cream cheese filling in. Even More Fruity GoodnessI like making a raspberry coulis goes really well with the lemon.     c. frozen or fresh raspberries just depends on how much you want to make. I like making extra so that I can drizzle more over the pieces after theyre cut.  tbsp. powdered sweetener or none if you want it to be more tartIf using frozen raspberries thaw them out. Then blend the raspberries and sweetener in something like a magic bullet or blender then strain the seeds out through cheese cloth so you have a really nice smooth sauce. Drizzle that over the cream cheese mixture you can kind of marble it in with a knife if you want. But if youre going to leave the cake like that then just drizzle it nicely the cream cheese will be too thick to make the marbling look really nice. But if youre going to top it with whipped cream go ahead and marble it! Let this chill for a while. You can either make it a few hours in advance or a day or two. But Id say if youre making it a day or two save the raspberry part for before you serve it. If you do the raspberry in advance its fine. Itll still taste great the colour just wont be as vibrant.Fancy It Up Even More For this you can go crazy. Either a thin layer or a nice thick layer of whipped cream.     c. heavy cream  c. sweetener again if you dont have a big sweet tooth leave the sweetener out whipped cream is delicious on its own. Its just all about personal preference.Whip up the cream and spread it over the top of the cream cheese and raspberry then be even fancier and drizzle the raspberry coulis over the top and serve! Sorry for such a long post. But this and this with extra coulis mmmm... is how it turned out! ,xxketo,coia2j0,2,t5_2u80h

3093172,0,t1_coikjlp,Id highly suggest not making yourself stick to restricted calories for the first month or longer. Let your body adjust. And no fasting at all. Its unnecessary and is probably helping to get you closer to the next bingepurge cycle. Concentrate on planning every meal and being prepared for executing the plan. Dont give yourself too much freedom or wiggle room. Make a plan of tempting and delicious keto meals and stick with it. Ask your family to help by putting things away or keeping specific things out of the house. If you can be out of the house if no one else is there. I always find libraries to be soothing safe places to be.Consider getting back into therapy if youre feeling your ED behaviors flaring. Keto can be very helpful for people recovering from ED but its part of a multipronged plan and its not magic by itself. It can go a long way toward harmonizing hormones gut flora and brain chemistry though. I think thats why people find keto to be a very helpful part of their healing regimen. ,xxketo,coiltlo,6,t5_2u80h

3183110,0,t3_2wlcjo,Get rid of the carbs fill your house car and desk with keto foods and commit to the plan. Stay disciplined meaning do it even when you dont want to. Focus on impulse control think past the moment of instant gratification and engage in some self denial think about what you want most rather than in any given moment. Motivation will fail you everytime commitment and discipline will not. Make a meal plan for the week and follow it. Youre always in control the question is whether you choose to exercise that control or give it away to carbs. You can do this but you need to realize that its not always going to be exciting. Push past the moments of discomfort we grow when we are pushed out of our comfort zones. Ask yourself  why are you doing this?  The only way to get through unfortunately is to push through.  Eat adequate calories get your electrolytes but at the end of the day you have to push past the cravings for them to get better.  It helps to plan ahead but then you actually have to follow the plan and that is completely up to you no one else can keep the cookies out of your mouth. Commit to the plan and follow through.  ,xxketo,corxgbz,5,t5_2u80h

3481062,0,t3_300iat,Definitely precook your meals for the first month or so. After that you dont necessarily have to but when you are trying to decide whats acceptable to eat in the beginning its really helpful.Heres a suggestion of what to cook up on a weekend to last you through the week Bacon Egg and Cheese cups  chop up some bacon and throw it plus some shredded cheese and broccoli or other veggies into some muffin tins. Mix up some eggs and pour them into the muffin tins. Bake until done and youll have quick and easy breakfasts. Casseroles  check out Ruled.me and Caveman Keto for some really great casserole recipes using things like diced chicken with avocado and cheese or ground beef with cheddar  a lot of them use some cream cheese to get a nice gooey consistency. Bulk meats  I like to cook up a whole chicken on the weekends and eat that all week  thighs and drumsticks  chicken breast diced up for various saladscasseroles and then at the end throw it all in a big pot and make some broth adding both NoSalt for potassium and table salt for sodium.  When you get sick of meat make some things like cobb salads lettuce with crumbled bacon hard boiled eggs blue cheese tomatoes avocado etc. Or just a plain Caesar salad watch out for the carbs in the dressing and skip the croutons.  If you get cravings for certain comfort foods find a low carb alternative. Google holy grail pizza crust if you start craving pizza  its quick and easy and delicious but not low calorie.Good luck!,xxketo,cpp2e7e,1,t5_2u80h

Any change you can think of has happened to someone on here suddenly stopping shorter longer infrequent super frequent heavy light more pain less pain etc etcTheres lots of reasons floated around sudden weightloss can up estrogen maybe lack of protein maybe the sudden increase in fat. There isnt really a reason like keto flu  electrolytes that we can help with.I dont want to freak you out. I spotted for close to  months had a few weeks off had the heaviest most painful period of my life a few weeks off a normal period then spotted for like another  weeks. Im on hormonal BC though so I suspect the interplay of whatever keto does and that was to blame for how extreme it was. Other girls have experienced similar but like I said other girls will have a my spotting last  days then I was back to normal  experience because there seems to be no set rule at all for this.See how it goes you know your own body so if you start to get concerned head to the doctors and have a check up.

A lot of us are logging meals in my fitness pal app you can join add us and see what others are eating. It helped me a lot. You need to eat.  cal is too little for you at this time.

3567254,0,t1_cpylhp0,I was tired when I wrote that other response and Im not exactly happy with it.  I wanted to expand so this is gonna be really long.When I started Keto I was so desperate.  My husband and I ate healthy but I was still packing on the pounds.  I was scared of keto.  It seemed like a scam.  So I decided that if I was going to try it at all Id have to really commit because what if halfassing it only made me fatter?For the first  weeks absolutely nothing went into my mouth without going into MFP.  And  of my food was weighed before I ate it.  Thats when I lost the inital lbs.  I was shocked by the difference.  It was mostly in my face but my gut slimmed a little.After those  weeks I bought a pair of mens Carhartt pants for work.  Size .  They came up to my bellybutton and were so tight that I had to suck in to do them up.  After I got my job as an electrical apprentice and I was climbing ladders all day hauling heavy materials not sitting at all thats when I lost the other lbs.  Suddenly those Carhartts were falling off while I was working.  A belt didnt help  they were several inches too big.  Other people at work were laughing at me because I was walking around like a gangster.Then Christmas rolled around.  I did well to not cheat I just filled myself up on turkey ham mustard and mayo.  I barely missed the treats my sisters and I were sharing some each taking  bite of the baking sitting around  sounds psychotic when I say it.  We wouldnt even eat a cookie by ourselves we were sharing them.  Oh well worked for us.I havent entered anything in MFP in months.  I havent weighed what Ive been eating. I said in my first post that I havent counted carbs and thats true but I really meant calories.  Im really spoiled in that my husband cooks for us and he brings me a plate of food I know Im lucky.  The only down side is that he has no concept of serving sizes so I often get HUGE quantities of food.  And Im still trying to learn that I dont have to eat everything on my plate even though my parents told me that for years growing up.Now Im trying to work on that because that simple calories in  calories out idea doesnt work so well when youre stuffing yourself with keto foods.  Im fuller a lot quicker on these foods but I still eat so quickly that it takes my brain a minute to register.  I also want to work on eating more slowly chewing better and savouring my food.  Im sure that if I get these things under control the fewer calories will be a happy byproduct.,xxketo,cpyw6fz,3,t5_2u80h
3567430,0,t3_316v3c,Hey I just wanted to mention maybe you should ignore the scale for a while. Its really easy to get sucked into the scale number madness and stress about why youre eating exactly as you should but you only lost .lbs. Or gained one.In my first few months of keto I found it a lot more useful to take measurements and only weigh myself once a week at most. That way I skipped the stress of the completely normal daily weight fluctuations but I still had a metric to rate my progress with. ,xxketo,cpywwhe,5,t5_2u80h

I didnt have time to eat until we cut the cake. Like I didnt even eat the dinner we served. No time.  Youll bloat. Accept that and move on. Remind yourself that you looked stunning in your dress and that those few pounds of water will flush out once you get back to it if you decide to get back to it postwedding.

This is the kind of thing that makes me curious if youve ever seen a therapist. It sounds like there are a lot of longstanding issues that dont need to be buried but effectively and appropriately worked through. For now you need to just focus on eating keto and doing the best for your body and not on the weight loss. Heal the mind and the body will follow. What terrifies you about another month without weight loss? If nothing else youre doing the best thing for your PCOS and IR regardless of weight and thats a victory. Are you close to or have a therapist you see? Get rid of the carbs make a plan for the rest of today and the week. Eliminate the need to make in the moment food decisions. Also realize the food hasnt changed the situation its still the same but now you feel worse. You have to find other coping mechanisms perhaps head out for a walk take a bath anything but turning to food as it will never solve the problem. I understand youre regretting the past but we cant live in regret we can only learn from it and hope to do better in the future.

I went to the gym this morning to test out my step routine on my Mom and best friend... and through a convoluted series of eventssuffice to say that this gym is very disorganized ended up teaching that routine to a small group including my gym boss.  The good news is that while I felt that it was a little repetitive and not super intense my participants really liked it and said some very encouraging things.  The most impactful of which was a girl who had been around at my old area gym which bit the dust while I was in Kansas telling me that she thought once I got my practice in and things polished that she saw me being just like an instructor from that old gym who was a my personal favorite b a kickass instructor and c part of my inspiration for becoming an instructor to begin with.

Well not really I cried in pure frustration once during parallel supports but whatevs I did that shit.  My plank and side planks were finally at  seconds!  Reverse planks really weak there and still only like  seconds.  Im gonna progress onto Incline Rows using a sheet shut in a door because I can do those doorway rows all day and not feel a thing. Its fascinating to me how some of my arm muscles seem to be way stronger than others.   The most hurty exercise of all are the bodyweight assisted squats  my quadriceps must be the weakest muscle in my body.  I also did deadhangs from my pullup bar because one day I will do a pullup.  Deadhangs are progressing into the  second range for me now yay!In weightrelated news I stepped on the scale at work yesterday and weighed  down one pound from my last weight on .  Woohoo goodbye  ounces  I am never eating you again!  Only  more pounds to lose til I am a normal size for my body.I will get on the scale again today for the  day challenge weigh in.

4280802,0,t3_39yhth,Hormonal birth control has been... tumontulous for me.  Some good and a lot of bad.  That bias aside I have to say that you need to assess things as a now.  How things are now is not as it was before.  If a certain drug is causing problems then you need to consider alternatives.  I admit its hard to give advice when I have no idea what caused you to change your BC or even your reasons for BC.  When losing weight your hormonal balance has to go through a lot of changes.  What worked for you in the past might not work for you now.  Consider what you want to fix and the pros and cons of how it affects your dietlifeultimate goals.I know I know nobody wants to go through a roulette wheel of pills.  Still sometimes thats what you have to try.  Im also interested to know what your deficit is and exercise levels.  If youre setting it too high then energy will flag.  Its not an immediate thing so you may only be noticing it now.  Then again hormones govern so much that it may indeed be a matter of a noncomplimentary drug.,xxketo,cs85yr9,1,t5_2u80h

4327235,0,t3_3aimmt,I wanted to chime in and add on to the amazing advice youve already received.Youre going to see people post on reddit and other forums and theyre going to lose a ridiculous amount of weight in a very short period of time. And maybe that will happen for you too  I really hope it does . But maybe it doesnt. Maybe you only lose one pound a week. Maybe after the first month youve only lost  pounds. DO NOT GIVE UP.I have been there. SO MANY TIMES. I have given up because everyone else was losing  pounds a month and here I was only losing  if that. But guess what?  pounds is still a loss.  pounds is still a loss. FUCK IT ONE POUND IS STILL A LOSS.I went from  to   pounds lost during a weight loss competition at my workplace but because my boss lost  pounds I gave up. And now Im  again because of a whole year of feeding myself out of selfpity because he lost more than I did.You have to compare yourself to only yourself.

You didnt gain those pounds in one month and it will take more than that for them to go away forever. Magnesium can help with constipation. You could do a small amount of coconut oil from a spoon.

I had let myself get a little bit relaxed after a few months of Keto edging closer to the g net carbs some days but now Im right around g net carbs again. Yes I can preplan my days but then I dont follow through unless I have a roast to cook. Considering I eat rather sporadically with whatever I feel like well I just take it as a sign that keto is very compatible for me. I like having freedom to decide in the moment. Trying to retrain my intuition on what to eat by double checking with MFP before every meal. A super long term goal is to be able to eat intuitively only doing weight checks twice a month and no logging. I can dream. ,xxketo,ct45yl1,1,t5_2u80h

Knowing I am eating more veggies he decided to make two kinds of vegetable side dishes corn and potatoes. He also keeps buying me beef jerky that is loaded with sugarcarbs. He is so sweet.

I have pictures where I was definitely slim and at the time I thought I was fat.  Your brain plays tricks.  I dont know if it helps but I found it easier to do a reset month by planning absolutely everything out because it was only a month I did it for  and then I was back in the swing of things.  So I wrote out every breakfast lunch and evening meal allocated snacks and stuck to it religiously.  It meant I didnt ask myself any questions or have to make decisions when I was shopping or risk picking up something with the wrong macrocalories in  I knew what I was eating.I wouldnt do it all of the time but for a month I found it useful.

It was a pretty cheap place about onetenth the price of Fogo de Chao so the meat wasnt the greatest but they still had excellent picanha which is my favorite cut.

I think most would agree its naturally easier to eat fewer calories on veganvegetarian as those foods are less calorie dense.

5798224,0,t3_3uk73b,I started out on like  calories a day because I needed to lose weight quickly for medical reasons.I was very much against the notion that a high deficit was a problem I had lost a lot of weight on paleo eating at a high deficit and been able to keep it off for a year.After like  months on  calories a day my body was like Im done and started pushing me to eat more.I have been eating at maintenance but still Keto and I have started losing weight again.  In fact my total weight loss this month has been about  lb as opposed to  lb while eating  caloriesday.And I will say I am a much more productive and engaged human at  calories and  g carbs than I was at  calories and zero carbs.

It caused a lot of anxiety.    I never even thought that keto would change this let alone so quickly!. I assumed if it did help with any of my symptoms that it wouldnt change anything until I was at a healthy weight. Nope apparently not. I encourage you to try keto if you feel like it would be a good fit for you.

5878795,0,t3_3vryav,Team.  I have got to get better at weekends.  I spent a lot of time at home from Saturday afternoon through Sunday night and while I did spend a few hours doing chores I should probably not have allowed myself so much free time near the kitchen.  I actually dont think that my calories were too insanely over because I grazed all day instead of having actual meals and then snacking in between anyway but I really want to lose a dress size by Christmas so this is not going to do.  I was really looking forward to crushing my lifts this morning but my back had other plans... I couldnt even get all of my bent row reps because it hurt too much to bend straight over.  I wanted to do some light squats just to see how they felt but it may be for the best that the racks were all busy.  I did some core work and piloted a few spin tracks instead and still got into work early.  Traffic around where I live seems to be getting worse and getting out even  minutes early is really helpful for avoiding rage.    I think Im going to do some gentle yoga when I get home and then ice my back and try to take it easy without going into Netflix and snack mode.  Im picking up some books from the library over lunch so that should help.  If only I had a quiet place where I could settle down and read... my husband is still in my old bedroom.  I am going to call my law office today and see where we are on the paperwork process.  If they can give me a good estimate on when hell be served I can make sure that someone is home to make sure that he gets served since he apparently wont respond to the doorbell.  Ill be very happy to do a good overhaul on my bedroom when hes gone.  Right now my laundry gets stacked up on the washer and dryer my PJs live in the bathroom and my bed is a sofa pullout in the den which is connected to the rest of the common area and affords no privacy.  Ive been living like this for a few months and frankly Im tired of it.  I am so ready for change.  Sorry to be a Monday downer guys!  Im still fairly optimistic about life despite my complaining I am going into next weekend with a plan for eating and some damn discipline and Im trusting the legal process to get me out of this marriage ASAP.  ,xxketo,cxq8qbd,1,t5_2u80h

My aunt is very overweight would probably have to buy  plane tickets big and after her mother. my grandmother died last year she has eaten her feelings away.  Grief depression whatever it is so difficult to deal with trying to kill it with the closest candy bar is often the easiest thing to do.  You seem to know this isnt your deal Id offer her one last I really care about you and want to spend time with you and support you type messageconvo and leave it at that.  You will have put your message and intention out as clearly as possible and kind of allow her to proceed with her life.  If she calls and wants to hang out awesome.  If she doesnt its on her.

5944993,0,t3_3wsjwf,My only thoughts ....  Many if only feelings in your post.   I dont want to tell you how to feel but I do find this thought pattern gets in the way of being able to start every new day fresh and do the right things for you that day and handle setbacks etc.   Eat well because it makes you feel better about yourself go for walks because it feels good and because you want to give your child some fresh air and things to look atengage withmodel healthy habits etc. Im  and while healthy most of my life I managed to make it to  with no baby as an excuse although I am holding pretty steady at  now at  weeks.   I lost  lbs with modified keto low carbs closer to what the breastfeeding ladies in ketobabies were doing metformin and regular exercise hiking and weights for me.   Not only did I feel better but never got to goal weight and already felt better about myself and what my body could do getting more comfortable in my skin.   So go for it. ,xxketo,cxyx2x1,1,t5_2u80h

MFP reports each night when you complete your food diary what you would weight in  weeks if every day was like today in terms of intake. That will give you that numerical feedback your craving without obsessing about the actual number.

Now I know why my cravings for all the things chocolatesweet were so bad and I am so crankyangry. Eating meat sticks and cheese for a late breakfast because Im crampy and cranky. And hungry earlier than usual I tend to skip breakfast usually and just have lunch at noon I may try IF eventually. Lunch yesterday was leftover chicken and cheese shredded lettuce and mayo on a low carb tortilla. Still so hungry. Ate more chicken and cheese after. Had a chocolate mug cake with dinner Leftover chicken and ranch last night with whipped unsweetened cream. I think I need to invest in some high quality cocoa powder. Hersheys Special Dark isnt that great without sugar. Id prefer a fair trade one too. One more reason to go to the new Whole Foods. And I think I need to eat MORE with my meals for now. Its easier to button my pants and the . pounds I lost in the first week has stayed off. Not shaky or nauseated or headachy anymore! Definitely less of a bloated belly. Drinking all the water propel and tea. Bought myself the books Wheat Belly and Grain Brain today. Keto Clarity is on my list next along with two Keto cookbooks I wanted last year. Making meatloaf meatballs shredded chicken and broth baked chicken thighs slicingchopping veggies for steamingroasting later forgot my radishes! Drat! and packing up some lunches and breakfasts for the week today.

Ultimately I am moving down the scale its just a total  steps forward  step back sort of cha cha! Ive been doing well with food. My appetite has definitely decreased. Not doing so great on the afterwork drinks and two nights in a row Ive consumed far too many light beers. But thankfully no crazy fast food binge afterward! Instead Ive just tried to down a bunch of water and then sleeeeeeep. Having happy hour drinks and nosh before a show tonight with my gay bestie.

6975416,0,t3_4b53wa,My hubby and I recently did this exact thing. It can be really hard to go back to strict eating for some reason. I was strict for nearly  months and then when the holidays came it just didnt make sense not to enjoy the food with it. But its midmarch and I am finally done with struggling. The carbs do make me feel like shit but its so easy to just eat like a normal American. What finally got me back into really giving a fuck was the thought of how much weight I could have been losing in the last  months. I didnt gain so that is still a plus. Eating like I was preketo I would have gained no doubt about it. So maintaining is a good thing but I dont want to maintain. By the end of  months on keto I was losing lbs per month. I could have potentially lost  pounds since we went off keto. I could have been at my goal by now had I stuck with it. THAT is the thought that helped me really get back to it. Realizing that I added months onto the process of reaching my goal is what helped me start having fucks to give. TLDR Cheat days are fine and probably mentally healthy for most of us but if you feel like you want a break ask yourself how much weight you could lose if you dont take that week off. Do you want the break or do you want to keep losing?,xxketo,d1701s0,3,t5_2u80h

7009709,0,t1_d1avs32,Volumewise you might be eating less than before but if youre eating better quality more nutrient dense or fatty foods they may also be more calorically dense and result in higher caloric consumption than before.  For example if you used to be lowfat and started cooking things in coconut oil its  calories per tablespoon.  A single chicken thigh is around  calories depending on size.  That could add up quickly.  Maybe you should input a few typical days worth of meals into a tracker to see how many calories you are actually consuming on an average day.  It may be much higher than you think.Also...BLASPHEMY!! berries have always been my absolute favorite P,xxketo,d1awai5,1,t5_2u80h

7093825,0,t3_4cklcu,The short answer is that losing all that weight will not fix whatever is hurting inside. It wont give you boundless confidence if youve never had it. And it wont inspire selflove and acceptance if you cant muster it now.By the way there is nothing shallow or superficial about wanting to feel good about the way you look. Not at all. Dont put yourself down for wanting to feel attractive and like people notice you. Thats something we all want.Being fat fucking sucks. When I was in my teens and early s I was a thin girl. I was very insecure and now I look back and cant get over how pretty I was and how blind I was to that fact. And I think thats true for most women. And I was insecure even though I did have people who were attracted to me even though I did get noticed. Those things happened and I was oblivious to them because of how I saw myself inside which was as someone who was ultimately worthless.A little over a year ago I left a broken marriage and the ensuing depression led me to gain even more weight putting me about lbs ahead of where I was in college. But I was committed to finding the happiness that didnt come from my relationship and I worked my ass off in therapy pushed myself to rebuild relationships with friends committed to building my confidence and finally said FUCK IT and tried dating. And you know what? I had more dates and sex at my fattest than I did in all of my s. Believe me plenty of guys ignored me because of my weight and some were even deliberately mean but I was feeling good about who I was and what I had to offer. And for the guys I did spend time with my confidence and selfassuredness were like catnip. Until that happened I always brushed off for people who told me that confidence comes from the inside. But damn it they were right. Now I am back on track to lose weight and feeling better energy wise. I have PCOS so keto is doing a lot more for me than just weight reduction. But my confidence is already in a good place and I can enjoy this process more because I know its not a desperate play to change who I am but simply where I can shop. Thats all. I already learned that I am deserving of love and affection and worthy of attraction just as I was. Just as I am. And just as I will be. I promise the same is true for you.How you carry yourself and how much you weigh does affect how other people see and treat you. Its a sad fact of life. BUT how you see yourself and what you feel worthy of is much more in your control than you think.Youre working hard to make a big change and I hope you can see it as a gift that you give yourself on a daily basis not so that you can be worthy but because you are worthy now. You deserve the effort it takes to get enough rest and water and to eat a diet that nourishes your body properly and even to come to this forum and receive support from people who understand what youre going through. You deserve all of it now and you always have.I know its hard to see it that way. I know. And you should keep doing what youre doing if its gradually making you feel better. But know that it is not going to erase any insecurities you have. And that is something you have to work on independently of your weight loss because they are not one and the same. You are beautiful now. You are smart now. You are funny now. You are caring now. You are deserving of good things now. Find a way to believe that without attaching any of those things to your weight because it is irrelevant. If you want to read something really inspiring Google Kelly Coffey. She is now a physical trainer who used to be lbs and has written about weight loss unlike anyone else. Shes just more raw and honest and willing to admit that it does not magically fix everything. And she has a lot of good ideas on finding ways to love yourself at whatever your starting point.Hang in there. Youre not alone in this. And you are worthy of the things you want long before you reach whatever your goal weight is. Cut your hair NOW. Color your hair NOW. Get a magnificent fucking manicure. Cant buy the clothes you want yet? Then get the shoes or the bag. Dont punish yourself by denying yourself things you deserve NOW. Just go on already and make like LOreal because youre worth it.,xxketo,d1kgd4a,4,t5_2u80h
7095736,0,t3_4cqmmr,The  thing that helped eliminateregulate my hungers and decrease my cravings was to switch to intermittent fasting. I have coffee with HWC and a tbsp of coconut oil when I get up in the morning and then nothing until pm when I eat a big awesome supper. . I drink lots of water all day but thats it. I do this even on days when I go to the gym either before work or after. I know some people are all OMG You cant workout without eating first! but actually.. yeah I can. It is a total nonissue. I dont get faint or weak or anything. I have no problems whatsoever. Sure sometimes I am extra hungry the day after a particularly intense workout but in general its just ... status quo. Doing intermittent fasting has done a huge amount for enabling me to stay within my calorie goal but it also has properly reset my hunger cues. Sure some days I get tummy grumbles around this time of day today being one of those days but it isnt the frantic OMG I AM GOING TO DIE IF I DONT EAT! hungers I would get when I was eating carbs. Im pretty indifferent to stomach rumbles now. I think a big part of why it works for me is also that it has taught me to be okay with being hungry sometimes and it has also taught me what actual hunger feels like vs. emotionalcarb triggered hunger. Ive finally learned what it feels like to be hungry AND what it feels like to be satisfied. And if Im feeling SUPER hungry in a forreal way then whatever Ill go eat a babybel or something to take the edge off. No biggie. But I rarely need that. I also second the advice to nix the sweetener. The sooner you can rid yourself of your sweet mouth the sooner you wont have so much trouble with cravings or at least that has been my experience. Like anbeav says the cravings will possibly never go away entirely but ditching the fake sweet stuff will definitely help.as for cheese with every meal I have chosen to cut back on my dairy intake simply because of the calories. Dairy is pretty calorically dense and it is very easy to overeat at least for me. ,xxketo,d1ko6jw,5,t5_2u80h

7241714,0,t1_d1w1r7q,I would suggest make a plan for yourself. My theory is to force myself to create a habit which takes about  days. Then it does get easier to stick with.  I would just add a daily water goalwhat works for you into what your currently doing. I suggest that you finish your water before allowing yourself whatever else you drink that way its out of the way for the day.  Work up from liter to . . I find it easier to drink really cold water to me it doesnt taste as bad. Is there a brand of bottled water you like. I found by trial and error which ones are too minerally and ones I could tolerate.  Bottled water gets expensive so I keep a filtered gallon water pitcher in the fridge and refill my bottles. I try to drink consistently during the day even if I am not thirsty. I have a desk job so I sit the bottle in front of me so its in my field of vision. I also kind of squeeze the bottle as I chug it to force the water faster and get it overwith. I also try to work within a goal time frame. So the planrules I have for myself. Allowed diet popteaflavored water taking vitaminsprescriptions. Plain water makes me gag. No getting around that.. Allowed diet popteaflavored water during meals only if planned water intake isnt met. Just a personal rule for myself.. I am at minimum . liters a day. So I have to finish it before I leave work. Time restriction. Bonus if I drink more for the day. If I finish my goal for the day then I dont worry about what else I drink for the day. Eventually I plan to ween myself off of other things and just allow water and flavored water. Work in progress.It has been working for me. Still struggling on the weekends tho cause I dont sit the bottle in front of me. Just might have to get it over with first thing in the morning then.I take my vitamins in the morning with diet popteaflavored watercoffee. Then I usually drink a bottle of flavored water in the morning at work until noon. Then Lunch. I force myself to drink my water after lunch until I leave work ish hour window. If I meet my goal I can drink whatever diet popteaflavored watercoffee the rest of the night. I usually dont want to drink much tho. It has effectively reduced my pop consumption significantly. I try not to drink as much in the evening to avoid middle of the night bathroom tripsEventually I hope to ween myself off the flavored water and pop to just occasionally and just drink water. I have to say drinking more water has made me feel better. I consider PopgtFlavored watergtcoffeegtteagtwater in that order. Tho in my head coffee and tea are a bit more desirable as they have diuretic properties flush the system.Hopefully that helps youLDR Make yourself a planrules that you can work with to develop a habit. Start small and increase dailyweekly.,xxketo,d21bwcr,1,t5_2u80h

7670463,0,t3_4kddtj,I had to work through the foodasreward head game so many times in thus keto journey! It may not work for everyone but instead of refusing to reward myself with food I started to reward myself with something good. For instance what I met a goal I would go out for seafood or have a nice steak. Keto friendly food that doesnt really fit into my budget and is only a treat for me.Were all going to find our own way that works for us something we can be at peace with and maybe my way isnt yours. Im bracing myself now for the comment fallout  about rewarding yourself with food. But if it were me and ChickfilA sounded like a reward I would go to ChickfilA. Order something grilled not breaded and fried. Dont eat the bun or ask them to wrap it in lettuce instead. Dont get the fries get their superfood kale salad instead. Its really yummy! Have a diet soda or a plain tea instead of sugar filled drink. Sometimes the experience of treating ourselves satisfies that head game and gives us peace. This is a journey  more like a marathon than a sprint. Theres going to be a lot of times this comes up and youre going to deal with it better if youre prepared mentally. Sit down and make a list of keto friendly things you really love to have  that arent everyday items for you. A beautiful steak a lobster tail some high quality dark chocolate ... only you know what those things would be. When you come to the point where youre feeling this way read your list and remind yourself what quality rewards look like. You are not a dumpster. Do not eat garbage food.

If the bruising is just an iron deficiency please get an expert opinion then there could be other things that need supplementation.In the meantime eat steak.  Eat all the steak.

7836714,0,t3_4mbkcv,I have a three year old daughter and I dont allow her to eat sweets cookies cake icecream candy nothing. She eats whole food paleo with some organic dairy like yogurt. I dont restrict natural carbs like starchy veg though I do restrict sweet fruit because shell eat tons of it if I let her. I do this for her internal health not for weight or looks or body image and I explain it to her why she doesnt get these foods with mama.Her dad lets her eat other stuff on weekends I think as long as it actually is about non weight related health its a good thing. Because honestly eating wheat and sugar and corn etc etc etc. is doing nothing positive for the functioning of her body or brain. It only has negative side effects which Ive witnessed multiple times.Im not worried. She has a great palate for real food. She eats all sorts of things and is very open to trying new foods. I think this is a great thing. I know other mothers who tell me their kids will only eat plain spaghetti with cheese or one kind of vegetable or all they want is crackers. I dont think this is healthy. Food is fuel and medicine. Its not entertainment a reward or something to fear but awareness and education is very important.

Kinda dont want to bore you with a bunch of chatter about things that might not be relatable for you.I will recommend you take progress pictures. Theyre great for everyone but theyve really helped me stay sane about this. My poor brain cannot keep up with my weight loss. I still see myself as morbidly obese most days. I would swear up and down I look the same if not worse than I did  or  pounds ago. Phantom fat is legit unfortunately. But if you take comparable progress pictures you give yourself the gift of proof that youre changing.

The band was embedded not in my stomach wall I dont think but Im not sure where I guess the opposite side of my stomach?  I was getting this relayed from my mom so instead of being able to slip it out pretty easily she had to pry it out. She said Ill probably be bruised. Also where the port was she had to get into muscle so she had to sew up an incision there too. Im obviously super sore but I have  incisions in my stomach so that makes sense.I am currently not in ketosis. They gave me crackers and juice when I was awake enough so I could take one dose of meds before I left so Im going to take the rest of the week kind of off of keto. I wont go crazy with it but I have to take care of myself and I didnt plan ahead enough to bring keto snacks. Im ok with this decision though. Once I get HOME home Im at my folks house Ill jump back on the keto train and HARD. My bff comes today to babysit me so Im pretty excited about that. For your photo tax for making it this far in my ramble I was only going to bring one dog the calmer one who doesnt jump like a Mexican jumping bean but my roommate got called to work an overnight trip unexpectedly so I had to bring psycho with me.

8233223,0,t3_4s5kwd,Hi! Ive been on Keto for  months and have learned quite a bit in my short time!  Not everyone loses weight the same. Some lose lots of lbs each week some lose lots of inches each week but as long as youre seeing progress thats all that matters. In  months Ive lost about lbs but about  inches just around my tummy area and lots of inches everywhere else too but i didnt measure beforehand. Its different for different people especially men but I would say if you havent lost lbs or inches in  weeks you need to readjust your macros. Some weeks Im down a pound some weeks Im up two pounds but as long as youre seeing downward movement youre doing something right. Also dont be shockeddismayed if you gain a lot of weight back next week. I lost lbs the first week and gained lbs the next week but Im continually seeing downward movement. As long as youre under g carbs youre in ketosis. Trimming carbs gets a lot easier once youve been doing this for a few more weeks get into an eating routine and get out of carb withdrawal. The first week I stuck around g carbs but now Ive got a good pattern where Im at around  net carbsday. You might find yourself ravenous during your period. Yep totally normal. I allow myself to go up to  calories up from my regular  during this time but I try to be very rigid about g carbs. Even with the higher calorie count I have managed to lose weight during my periods which is wowza to me. If you feel snacky go for water first and if that doesnt work get some more fat amp protein. Feel like bacon at am? Go for it. Protein and fat are much better for you than filling up on carbs even healthy ones like celery one of my favourite snacks because it will fill you satisfy you and keep you full for longer periods. For some reason I was not hungry during my period last week and this week Im super ravenous. Yesterday I ate more carbs than I should have g! and I realized I was an idiot and should have been eating fat all day instead of trying to remain in my caloric limit.  It does take time to relearn food habits. Having been trained our whole lives that carbs are good and fats are bad we basically have to program ourselves to a different thought pattern. If you mess up its not the end of the world but try to mess up by eating more calories and not more than g carbs personally I dont think its healthy to go in and out of ketosis especially for a woman but thats just me.,xxketo,d56piuz,1,t5_2u80h

8303594,0,t3_4t8agh,Im confused  are you not making it through more than a couple of meals because of stomach issues? Or you arent able to resist carby foods?One of the biggest things to help if it is cravings is to plan! Plan your main meals and have snacks ready to go on the fly. If you work somewhere where they serve food bring your own snacks and eat them to avoid being hungry when youre near food you shouldnt be eating. My office is directly across from the kitchen at work and they are constantly making carby food sweets etc. I keep cheese eggs meat nuts on hand so when my hunger is up and the smell of brownies is in the air I have something to fill me up and battle the craving!!Im not sure what kind of cheap meals youre looking for but some of my gotos include Roast and veg  a large roast beef pork whatever is cheap at the market will last a couple of days and I cook it with all sorts of veg... Cauliflower broccoli Brussel sprouts beet greens green beans etc.  Chicken thighs  seasoned skinon baked and then crisped under the broiler Ground beefporkturkey  make a hash with veggies and cauliflower rice bunless burgers or cauliflower topped shepherds pie Salads  my favorite is spinach and red lettuce shout out to my garden!! with tomato avocado cucumber red pepper radish basil and oilvinegarsaltpepper...

If that means laying low for a couple of weeks and actually not going out this is what must be done. Just like I am not going to eat bread or cake think of it as another part of this way of eating at least for a while.  I have found it no longer has the same pull. Once you do that you may be able to get back in there and alternate drinks with seltzer or water. Or you may find it is not worth it.

8462485,0,t3_4vksrk,What does one bad weekend entail?I think the important thing to note when considering keto is that its best when not just chosen as a temporary diet in order for it to work it should be a lifestyle. Otherwise you will risk putting everything back on. So depending on what they mean you might have to limit bad weekends.Keto can definitely help almost everyone so instead of just praising it Ill comment on specific concerns you can still maintain and build muscle. The diet has adequate protein which you can also adjust to your needs. If you head over to rketogains youll find an entire sub for this purpose. Im still maintaining my muscle buildup from deadlifting and heavy squatting despite a severe dump in effort in that aspect just to give a personal example  once youve gotten over the initial weeks of keto therell be no brain fog. A part of keto is making sure you get sufficient amounts of  nutrition. The fat contents of the diet will make you feel satiated more quickly so youll be eating less calories but do it right and you wont ever starve nor be depleted. I understand your concerns though I work as a translator which is  hours a day of heavy brain work. My fog lasted a week and since then for the past three months Ive felt clear as day  even on days with very little sleep.,xxketo,d5zchyg,1,t5_2u80h

8491030,0,t3_4vyl8c,This is something Im still struggling with unfortunately.  I know its just a brief distraction and that basically Im just looking to briefly light up those happy centers in my brain but sometimes you just really want that distraction.  At this point going out of keto for it is not worth it to me but I will sometimes overdo it with cheese or pepperoni or even broccoli.  I would love to have other hobbies to distract myself but having a toddler at home makes it difficult snacking is quick and easy with her around while things like reading surfing the web doing crafts or watching tv arent really options.  The only thing Ive found that works is getting out of the house for a walk.So yeah still a struggle but I find the stricter I am on keto the easier it gets to say no to food.  I went lazy keto for a couple weeks on vacation and that led to carb creep overeating on calories and a month long stall.

I go pretty Mama Bear and get super frustrated with adults who act like allergies are just a cry for attention.  At the same time seeing how well they handle not being allowed to eat certain foods has been quite an example for me as I do keto.

8636566,0,t1_d6kwb4n,Remember that there are a lot of snacks out there as easy to bring that you might not have thought about.  Lunch meat and cheese can be layered with cheese on the outside for easycarry.  Different nut butters come in individual servings you can eat them with celery or other veggie.  There are Quest bars and Honest by Design keto bars or some other low carb snack of that nature that you can keep in a backpack when hunger hits hard.  Hard boiled eggs which some supermarkets even sell already deshelled.  Good luck having a crazy schedule can be really really difficult but keeping yourself well fueled can make all the difference and help you feeling good too!  If you have refrigeration for your shift you can bring just about anything.  Way to take charge of your day!,xxketo,d6l6ftw,1,t5_2u80h

8662087,0,t1_d6obbeu,OMG TLDR I stuck to the basics didnt quit listened to anbeav didnt quit was hard on myself didnt quit was easy on myself still didnt quit.Took my sedentary tdee and aimed for a  calorie per week deficit but averaged over a few weeks so I wouldnt feel bad for going over the weeks where I was hungrier or not in total control of my food traveling basically and so I wouldnt force myself to eat on days I didnt want to eat. Once my calculated tdee was too small to allow a day average deficit I got a Fitbit charge HR and let that tell me if I had a  calorie deficit or not  it is pretty accurate for me. I think my average daily intake has been  over the whole thing sometimes  sometimes  a day. Ive always been a meal skipper so IF was easy to incorporate. If I feel like fasting I fast. If I dont feel like it I dont. My job has times where it is incredibly physically demanding lifting  pound things all day or night during a production run so that helped. I lifted at the gym or work  times a week and cardioed  times a week from March to June when I discovered the hernia then the lifting at the gym stopped. I tried the elliptical and the exercise bike but that hurt too so now I take walks and try to do my job very carefully and with assistance. Didnt eat back exercise calories. Drank all the black coffee and all the Coke Zero. Got really good at roasting dry sauting and broth sauting. Meal prepping saved me from making many bad decisions. Logged restaurant meals at . portions if they were already in MFP otherwise tried to estimate the ingredients and add two tablespoons of oil if in doubt. Was super strict on  net carbs for the first five or so months didnt even try halo top or other replacements until June well Coke Zero and Mio I guess. Threw boxes of twinkies out the front door when my husband brought them home. Now I eat mostly vegetables and dont worry if I go over carbs because I want a huge plate of broccoli and a little chicken for dinner instead of a plate of ribs. Lots of lean meats. Havent bought a carton of HWC since February. Still dont like almond milk but I get the unsweetened shelf stable kind and use it in my coffee sometimes. Pungent cheese is so much more bang for the calories  mozzarella and mild cheddar is banished. If I eat nonketo for whatever reason I log it and pick it back up with the next meal. Ive probably been kicked out of ketosis sometimes but I havent really noticed and it doesnt cause me stress or bother. If something is obviously not keto I dont eat it. I dont talk about keto. Continue to weigh and log everything. Still trusting my Fitbit to tell me if Im in a deficit goal of  deficit that Im either way under or way over on a day to day but it averages just fine  have averaged about  calories in per day over the past two months since I dont have  pounds of fat to burn anymore.Got used to stalls. I stall about  days of a month then the weight comes off in one or two bursts then I stall again. I keep doing what Im doing and try to ignore the Fuck Its. My expected weight matches up with my actual weight every  weeks usually for a day before I bounce up again. When I start to lose I lose for a few days then bounce back up two pounds then hang out in a five pound range that eventually starts trending back down. I just keep going knowing that the results will eventually show up.Idk I wasam highly motivated. I had to change  like I couldnt stand another second doing what Id been doing and being who I was being. Something just snapped inside of me then the stars aligned when my dietitian who Id picked out of my insurance plan list put me on lazy keto then I found rketo and loseit then I went full on loggingweighingcicoketo and it worked.,xxketo,d6odmu5,5,t5_2u80h

8711581,0,t1_d6uh85x,Im really glad to hear that youre looking into therapy referral. I know that listless apathetic feeling and it really impacts your will to do anything. Just remember that keeping your therapy appointments are important. Ive been in a place where I just didnt have the drive to get out of bed and go but missing my appointments only set me further back and I always felt better after going even if it was the only thing I did that day. I hope it helps you at least a little and you feel better soon. Its hard to recommend activities when Im not sure what your hobbies are! At first when I didnt have the drive to even move out of bed I would force myself to read or get to my computer and play video games with my friends for a couple hours. Once I started feeling a little better I started cooking and baking. Now I like to go hiking and I take my coworkers two lovely girls on walks to a nice park to pokemon hunt when I can! My advice would be to dabble in a little bit of everything until you find something that you like. Ive painted played soccer piano guitar done ballet. Not for very long mind you but just trying things out whether I was good at them or not. I learned a lot about myself and what I like and dont like along the way! Good luck with your project and I hope you have a good day. Take it one day at a time and you will get through it.  ,xxketo,d6ul19r,2,t5_2u80h

If more than than happens on keto fine but I suspect even in the guys a lot more of it than they realize is water weight.

Thats always a battle.Ketowise all is good even though the scale doesnt move much these days.  Im close enough to goal that its slow going.  Not being able to work out makes it difficult to reach a good deficit.  Another reason Im looking forward to surgery.  Ill get there eventually.

And Ive got too much to do and too many cute heels to wear to be this awkward walking around.  Even though I know three days of lifting a week are best I am considering sticking to two.  I mean Im not training for anything and Im not a competitive body builder either.  Why do I have to do whats best?  Cant I just stick with whats better than nothing and far better than what I did before which was less than nothing?  Im an almost year old stay at home mom wouldnt it be enough to be at a healthy weight and have a somewhat toned and healthy build?  I guess Im talking myself into starting slow and maybe adding more later if this goes well.

8966649,0,t3_52x1bj,Mortons Lite Salt is a mix of sodium potassium and sodium chloride instead of just sodium chloride in regular table salt. Its the cheapesteasiest way to get more potassium in your diet. I need to supplement at least  mg per day in order to keep the leg cramps away. I know other people may need less but I need a lot!Also look at different forms of magnesium. Some cause stomach upset and loose stools. There is also different bioavailability based on the forms. You need to research and see what works best for you. I have trouble sleeping without enough magnesium so I make sure to take forms that have been proven to cross directly into the brain. Also take B vitamins with magnesium to increase absorption.And pay attention when you use artificial sweeteners. Some people and I am one of them actually have an insulin response to them.

I made a comment saying being proud of your achievements by comparing them to other peoples failures isnt supportive and that we go through this experience differently and that calling them nazis is offhand and tacky. I was completely respectful.A few women made comments to this effect and her responses were so dismissive and completely against how the group operates...I cant believe how sad I am I cant even access the group page Ive been completely blocked.

9412685,0,t3_59hw57,I second whats been said before if there are serious physical issues you should absolutely talk to your doctor and discuss the symptoms and your diet with himher.If you find yourself failing every day then its a willpower and discipline issue. Part of keto is dealing with sugar and carb cravings it sucks but we all go through it. Up your fat intake to keep yourself from being hungry and toss out any junk you may have hiding in your house. Give yourself the best chance at success.To your point about keto being a bit boring. Yes it is. For many of us though food has served as a therapist entertainment comfort etc. Keto is about teaching your mind and your body that food is fuel not fun. One motivational story that always sticks out to me was of an elite athlete or maybe it was a coach I cant remember who was asked what the key to athletic success and weight loss was. Their answer? Learning to accept the boredom. Losing weight and exercise can be very boring you eat the same foods for weeks months years on end and you do the same exercises for months and years during training. Its boring and its tedious. Success comes when you accept that and push through it anyway.Hopefully this gives you some food for thought. You can absolutely do this but it wont be easy.

In my heart taking care of others every need gives me such a great deal of pleasure I havent been able to get from anything else so far in my life but I wonder if it has caused this unhealthy self sabotaging or easier to excuse not having time etc My life has always been about the should as you worded it. I very rarely feel like I choose. I am scared of my therapist reaction to what I feel are confessions such shameful secrets I am horrified to even consider saying out loud but I think trying to find the courage could help. My therapist is amazing amp has helped me through so many indepth issues Ive had. This is almost the one thing in my life I keep secret amp am so disgustedashamed. Ive ranted enough  I  am going to re read your comment a few times more to let it sink in. Thank you for your words thank you for sharing your thoughts.,xxketo,daozo4g,3,t5_2u80h

9903410,0,t1_daxlqau,I think it does. I have lost in from my stomach and each of my thighs... and various inches all over in about . months. I am down  sizes than I was previously at this weight. I do exercise and eat keto but I credit a lot to the tool. The research is there and they are doing more so its not just some malarkey. I would suggest watching the youtube videos and joining her Facebook page and decide. My thoughts or my situation. I had maybe ish to lose as well. This is not my first round of keto but I plan to keep on it this time. I had been on keto  months and pretty much stuck. I had maybe reached lbs gone so far. In August I had enough of being stuck and joined a gym and started exercising. About then I started worrying about loosing weight and having too much loose skin. I felt that I was getting a bit saggy and still had lbs to go  . I have been trying not to think of the skin issue because its to get healthier.... right. Periodically I would search for solutions until I stumbled upon a post on Facebook. No way did I want to waste the money for something that wouldnt work. Yet I didnt want to give up on the off chance it would so I tried the knock offwhich doesnt really work well... totally worth the real thing. I watched videos and read her studies and joined her Facebook page. I compared it to what actual surgery would eventually cost and figured it was worth the investment and a fraction of the cost of a surgery that I wouldnt ever be able to afford. I can honestly say I dont think I will need surgery now. My body shape has totally changed and areas have lifted significantly. I had a major belly in the beginning and it has reduced to a smaller potbellywhich I cant really tell if I have shorts on. Dont get me wrong I think the diet and exercise are and important part and required.  I think this makes my muscles work better as well as the other benefits. I have to say the change isnt really immediate it takes time and can be painful. But I consider it a miracle stick. In short it breaks up your fascia and cellulite and can even fat lysce as well which frees your muscles to function better for exercise. My sister even saw my progress and immediately bought one. I still have maybe  lbs I want to lose will see how it goes. I can totally see myself flattening out it will just take time.  I would say the sooner you want to start the better as it does take time and your body needs time to adjust.You can pm me if you have any questions. I really suggest looking at all her research and making your decision based off that. Its what I did the results are kind of unbelievable. I wouldnt have believed it unless I saw the results on myself.  There are a ton of testimonials on her group and progress photos. She also has a book explaining it all coming out in February. I can imagine that it will get more popular after. It does come off as a marketing scam or one of the sold on tv products....lol. I am glad I tried it. Hope that helps. ,xxketo,dayfrce,2,t5_2u80h

9945572,0,t3_5hm8b7,Youve already gotten so much great advice in this thread but Im going to throw out my approach. I dont know your personality but I am the type to keep things light. I personally wouldnt involve medical stuff much simply because I think it makes some people a little uncomfortable. I tend to approach it with a light comment like I ditched the carbs for a while or Im going easy on grains. If they ask why you can mention it makes you feel great. Honestly at the very least almost everyone is familiar with Atkins and a lot of our moms tried it. Sometimes I explain it like that  similar to Atkins. I also think it helps to adapt your own meals. For example if they make pasta see if you can just steam up some veggies and throw all the yummy sauce and toppings on there. I try to make people feel like I still really appreciate that they cooked for me. Good luck! Have a great time with your boyfriend and his fam! ,xxketo,db3xlfl,1,t5_2u80h

10184064,0,t1_dbye0hd,Your link is complete bull shit. Over at rketobabies there are lots of breastfeeding ketoers. The only real concern since OP is starting a diet is to gradually eat fewer carbs and calories. Going fast can lead to low supply. Not ketoacidosis. If you follow the links to the article about the one woman who had ketoacidosis she had been in ketosis for  years and the diet was one possible factor as was the fact she was stressed and very recently delivered which screw lots of hormones but the doctors were just publishing any possibility and media jumped on it being the diets fault. Not a real concern. OP just needs to drink a lot of water keep electrolytes up and not cut calories and carbs so fast her body thinks a famine just started. Also nurse the baby very frequently to keep supply up. And keep in mind supply is variable and hard to monitor if OP feels supply is dropping she can take it even slower so it works for both her and baby. ,xxketo,dbyf4oh,7,t5_2u80h

The longer shifts seem to be helping me be more productive at work as a lot of my job involves long processes that I sometimes run out of time to start on eights. I will get a ton done today which is a great feeling and I get to exercise at work which is rad. But I got some very bad news yesterday... my boss scheduled to retire in December of this year has decided to leave early due to her Moms health. I was initially very excited for her because shes been working her tits off for  years at this agency but then I was super bummed about my own work life. I have to learn the rest of her job so I can run the whole department at least while they hire someone new and then I have to live without her and pray to the old gods and the new that I get along with whoever they hire whom Ill be training. She has been far and away the best boss Ive ever had. She was a scientist back in the old days when women went to work in dresses and she has the acid splashes on her shins to prove it. Shes been such an inspiration to me and I dont know how to say goodbye. Thankfully her husband will still work in the lab so Ill see her around and shes promised to try to be available for questions. Other than my work life about to be turned upside down its all good in the hood. We have cats and dog living together but only minor hysteria. Hopefully they learn to get along because my kitties arent getting the attention to which they are accustomed and its breaking my heart.

10343263,0,t3_5o3byr,Weigh in today and maintaining .  Im actually OK with this   that despite struggling to get to sub carbs and into my preshark bloat days Im not gaining. Im maintaining an  lb loss  small in my total needs but worth being proud of.  From that I also reversed my flair decision to count a restart although Ive been struggling I choose to count that I never quit just fumbled around a bit.  Minor issues I refuse to get caught up on anymore.Huge weekly win for me is that despite lots of snow shoveling aiding stuck neighbors moving furniture around again and again and fatiguing my old shoulders with grime fighting and still doing  days of TTapp DVD my muscles are responding with light sore like a normal body and not triggering fibro flares.  Even while not sustaining perfectly keto.  The old me would have taken this as license to relax my diet more. The now me is more motivated to get tightened back down and see how much morebetter I can realize.  Helping it along is all of these little tastes of carb foods just arent ringing my bell like they use to either.  Most are meh I like my regular food better.  This is huge for me to realize Im making meaningful progress despite not being perfect and scale numbers staying stubbornly high.May you find your successes in whatever today brings you!

10482073,0,t3_5q3cq3,gt  Ive had two of my fitnessbuff classmates tell me that because Ive always been fat that my body will try even harder to avoid getting skinny. That a fat cell never dies and even if I drop weight those empty fat cells will keep trying to get fat again.THIS IS NONSENSE. If you are heavier than these people then they dont want you to succeed because they are most likely insecure about their own weight and feel better about themselves when they are around heavier people. If they are similar to you physically then they dont want you to be skinny because then you wont be like them anymore. Even though you may be a happier you a more active you and probably a better looking you they will only see their own physical flaws and will project that onto you. I really am generalizing here and I hope Im wrong about them and they are actually sweet people that have no idea what their talking about but truly care about you. I am only writing this because I experienced this with a few friends when I began keto and I was treated very differently when I lost the weight. I noticed them starting to compare themselves to me out loud when we got together and pick at their appearance when that had never happened before and I feel like being around me just made them feel insecure which is very disheartening. None of those friends were overweight but those friendships were never the same.Dont tell anyone about your diet. Just do it and check in here every day to stay inspired during the hard times. It will be hard at first but it will be so worth it. You can do this.,xxketo,dcw91yu,2,t5_2u80h

Look into intermittent fasting.Also if your protein is too high with keto it will mess up your insulin.Based on my own experience I would say  make sure your protein is very moderate g or less per day  increase your fat intake to compensate  look into intermittent fasting IFFor me the most effective IF was dinnertodinner hour fasts. Sometimes  hours i.e. not eating for all of Tuesday. My blood sugar went from prediabetic to middlerange normal in less than a year. It probably would have been faster if Id used any discipline at all but I was super disorganized and it still worked. I no longer have any symptoms of PCOS  but I suspect it would return quickly if my diet went off the rails again.If youre still taking metformin youll have to be careful  fasting adjusts your blood sugar so fast you can become hypoglycemic if you keep the higher dose.

10726953,0,t3_5tg9kr,Its a huge mindset and palate change. I know us ketoheads like to talk about how easy and effortless this is once youre adapted but I found there were some surprising psychological speedbumps for me. The biggest was that suddenly food wasnt a party in my mouth every day anymore. It sounds silly to some people especially people who were already big meatcheese lovers. But food used to be something I looked forward to so much. Not even necessarily as a pickmeup or consolation but just as a fun activity. I had a rough few months coming to terms with the fact that not every meal can or should be a celebration of flavour. Food is fuel. Dont get me wrong.. dont give up hope of having a passion for these foods but maybe try to think of how damaging it ishascan be to see food as such a pleasure all the time.As for finding the foods themselves downright unappealing right now Im confident that will change. Your palate will adapt and your ketoadapted brain will learn to trigger cravings for rich fatty proteindense foods. For now I would suggest trying to work in more carb substitutes! Cauliflower mashed potatoes Cauliflower rice Zoodles Eggcream cheese noodles Keto pancakesTry to trick your mouth for a while until your body starts to recognize that this is what it needs and wants from now on.

Just realized my flair is at a lower weight that was probably a fluke a few weeks ago.  Updated it to be honest with myself and yall.This weekend Ill be teaching sex ed need to prep for that!   then writing up a report for church.  DH and I had a talk about finances last night and I did not say something that I should have so Ill also be remedying that issue.  And Im embarrassed to say that I STILL have Christmas decorations to take down  its the Baccarat ornament tree that Ive been collecting since we got married automatic Christmas gift for the motherinlaw to give me.  Its daunting because I put each ornament back in its own little box.

That being said you cannot successfully do a ketogenic diet and still eat maple honey rice and beans. That article is also pretty heavy opinion based look into more factual articles on carbs and nocarb diets. Personally keto works for me but it does not work for everyone. Find your happy medium!

11122898,0,t3_5ygb42,My personal favorite response to catcalls? Dinosaur noises. Velociraptor pterodactyl whatever noise you prefer. Just a horrible shrieking noise basically. Its really the perfect response. The catcaller freaks the hell out and Im deeply deeply amused and ironically a little grateful for the opportunity to laugh rather than creeped out by the catcall.My weight has fluctuated as an adult so I know I get catcalls from just about my current weight  and below. So I was fairly prepared for it to start again. In my regular life people I know have all been pleasant and supportive and complimentary and Ive worked hard to not let that get in my head oh Im looking great so obviously I looked like shit a few weeks ago which is where my head would ordinarily go.As far as people on the street? I tried hard to zone it out at my heaviest and Ill continue to do the same at my lightest wherever that ends up being. Im the same me with the same personality and same antisocial tendencies regardless of what the scale or the tag in my pants says. It sounds like your social anxiety is driving a lot of your feelings on it and honestly? Thats okay. Thats still a part of you. If you want a conversation have a conversation. If you dont its still totally okay to ignore people.I am also avoiding putting any pictures on social media because I knooooow as soon as I do Im going to have a text from a particular exboyfriend.

Ive been doing great all this time. Ive lost  lbs ignoring this postbinge lb bounce and maintained it through a vacation and a couple of lazy weeks after that.

11177866,0,t1_deyxzlp,I didnt have issues with sciatica until I got really heavy thats why I am hoping that weight loss will help with that particular issue. The plantar faciitis is also a symptom of my weight as well since Ive never had an issue with it before. It has eased up a little since Ive gone down about lbs.        In terms of how I feel overall....I really dont feel much different than I did before starting keto other than noting that I feel significantly less bloated and uncomfortable after meals. I guess I was really hoping for some super noticeable changes in how I feel like being less tired and having more energy.        My meals are generally like this   Breakfast is  eggs omelette style with c of shredded cheese and something to spice it up like jalapenos or chilis and some hot sauce like buffalo with a cup of coffee and  tbls of heavy cream.   Lunch is usually a salad with canned tuna in olive oil assorted chopped veggies like a celery stalk c cucumber and c of spinach or lettuce. I like to throw in about g of cheese to bump the protein and add some bulk.   Dinner is usually a serving of meat such as chicken thigh pork chop or something with ground beef and side veggies. Last night we had chicken leg quarters with a pilaf I made of riced cauliflower cremini mushrooms spinach and spicy italian sausage and a side salad of shopped cucumber cherry tomato and fresh basil.     I always weigh and measure everything to make sure Im getting proper proportions and not going over my carbs particularly.     I dont necessarily think that getting the keto flu was the key to being in ketosis but it seems so common that I wondered if I wasnt doing something right. I understand being in ketosis to mean that as long as I am eating less that g of carbs a day Im pretty much guaranteed to be in ketosis. ,xxketo,deyzyj9,1,t5_2u80h

You Should just try little amounts back in your diet maybe you arent allergic that bad.Nobody goes to someone with Chrons and tells them to eat corn or seeds just in case they arent really that sick.And then in the most moderate example vegans or vegetarians or pescatariansthis one has a religious element even all exist perfectly fine on different diets.And then in some cultures like the Inuit they live almost  off of meat frozen caribou walrus whale meat fishand they thrive on that diet while once processed food became more common heart disease happened for the first time. This and the Okinawa diet that consists mostly of fish and seaweed happen to be natural variants of Keto and low carb.Hindus sikh and Muslims all have some degree of specialized diets and in India vegetarian food is just part of how things are cooked.

11344223,0,t3_61vyo5,It will greatly depend on height weight amount of calorie restriction and activity. A  morbidly obese person can lose much more per week than a  slightly overweight person. A   lb person eating at a  deficit will lose more than a   lb person eating at a  deficit. A short person who works out a lot could lose the same as someone taller and heavier but who is sedentary. That being said  lbs a week is considered healthy weightloss by many experts. Ive noticed that on average it seems the xxketoers lose about  pounds a week after the initial weeks of adapting to the diet. Though there are the rare few that lose . tend to be tallerheavier. For myself Im quite short and cant cut as many calories so I lose maybe lb a week. Also weight can fluctuate a lot especially if you menstruate so some will gain beforeduring menstruation then suddenly lose  pounds. ,xxketo,dfhuj3b,9,t5_2u80h

I meet with my new physio this afternoon to try to get a handle on my knee. Im  months postACL reconstructionmeniscus repair.

11383690,0,t1_dfknzvv,This is helpful for me to hear. We are similar ages and the same height. I started out at a little less weight than you but want to lose about that amount of weight  lbs. Its been  weeks and my progress has been nonlinear but currently averages about  lb per week. My math suggests that if the losses continue at that rate I will reach my goal weight in late June so about the same amount of time it took for you. I hope it works for me too! Re looking athletic I totally feel you. I used to swim and do yoga before my health issues started and I got too tired to do anything and put on all this weight and I spent a year lifting heavy weights despite my fatigue and lost nothing and didnt see crazy changes in my body ok my shoulders looked pretty good. I want to add exercise back in but have been worried about going back to the weight room and stalling the loss. Which I know is silly but brains are not always logical instruments.

11414531,0,t1_dfpswdw,Im not yet convinced of the benefits of MCTs. MCTs merely put themselves at the front of the line to be burned for energy. So some people might get a temporary energy boost. After theyre gone its back to regular old burning for the body. Other than that I havent seen any particularly convincing data that MCTs are something every one should be eating. I myself eat liquid MCT oil almost every day mostly because I can put it in a smoothie and it doesnt taste like anything or become hard and its not a polyunsaturated fat.

I find though that my relationship with food is changing to a point where I am able to have a small bite enjoy it and then not feel the need to eat more. Preketo me was able to handle that. I actually consider my bites a small victory every time I am able to enjoy a bite and then say enough reminds me that I am in control of my choices.

11734021,0,t3_67fa9l,Happy Tuesday!Last night I made a huge rib eye and dipped it in horseradish and had some broccoli with butter and salt. It might be my favorite quick meal. Im doing really good on my waters and electrolytes I am expecting a small lost soon. Puppers is pulling off the muzzle so I got a smaller one but now her new collar does not fit in it. This is stressing me out. We go today she will let me put it on but pulls it off. RAWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!  I got to wear shorts yesterday we hit the s and I realized the w jean vs the  well that w for woman is too big so that pair will not be used too much longer ... NSV!!! That was my longer bermuda pair. I can use a belt for now.  Im ok with this using thredup for these summer items considering they should be temporary clothing anyways.

11737021,0,t3_67hcob,Ive only recently started making them as well. The texture can be a bit of a deterrent. I imagine they are like tapioca. But the gel that is created from the chia seeds absorbing moisture is what you want. I made mine with vanilla unsweetend almon milk heavy cram and cocoa powder and then added a couple tbsps of sugar free vanilla syrup and it takes great. The key is to stir like crazy. Let it sit in the fridge a couple hours then stir like crazy again. I find that it makes the texture a bit easy to swallow pun intended,xxketo,dgqf673,1,t5_2u80h

11765023,0,t3_67ucwe,Guys girls I am officially starting keto again. My baby is . months old and Im ready to get serious again. It took a while to get serious because my milk supply was dependent on carbs and calories. I finally found a formula that my baby wouldnt totally refuse. So Ive been able to do  breastmilk and formula. This alleviates my stress about not producing enough and not being able to feed my baby. Yesterday was my first day back and today is looking strong as well. Im excited guys!! I gained  pounds during pregnancy and I still have  pounds to lose.,xxketo,dgtlfu8,2,t5_2u80h

11791040,0,t1_dgwj6xf,What are you going to wear for your race?  I loved picking out my race outfits!  Are you a runningskirt wearer?  I had a few but I never really wore them often.  My most frivolous running attire was a pair of down yes down shorts from Athleta with a  or  inch inseam.  Now at what point are DOWN shorts appropriate?  And flattering?  Not a chance.  LOL.  They looked so good on the model though...   I wear them now as a layer for snowshoeing.  My rear is always so cold and I like to think my . down shorts help keep it toasty.  ,xxketo,dgwjyho,3,t5_2u80h

11796062,0,t1_dgx0k8h,Yes. KCKO gets so flipping exhausting even if its ultimately worth it. Have you tried IF? I heard its a good way to break plateaus but I cant bring myself to stop eating. lol,xxketo,dgx4gsp,1,t5_2u80h
