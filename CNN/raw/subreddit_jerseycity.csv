3226879,0,t1_cowfuv5,gt Do drivers carry cash to make change?I generally start the night with  singles.  Considering that only a portion of the passengers tip this as been sufficient so far.  If you have a driver youd like to tip and need to break a larger bill just ask.  gt Isnt it the responsibility of the Uber Drivers to monitor their own pay rate and decide if it is worth it for them? Reading this thread it is apparent that Uber has cut your wages in some fashion how hard would it be for the drivers as a group to demand not a return to previous wages but a tip option in the app?They have demanded a tip option in the app in the form of a petition with something like  signatures.  And they are refusing to drive at these low rates and gaming the system in the only way they can make a profit hurting Ubers profits.  I do it too and its the only reason I drive at all.  Because new drivers are signing up everyday you are not dealing with a defined workforce and Uber seems to never be hurting for drivers.  Striking and unionizing are not feasible options.  Striking actually works in Ubers favor by creating a surge and works against the passengers by requiring them to pay more.  The new drivers drive until they realize its not worth it or they figure out how to game the system and drive less for more pay but there are already plenty new drivers to take their places.gt Are the customers at Restaurant  wrong not to tip? Because that is exactly what Uber has done. They have given the impression to the customers myself wakasm etc that we should not be tipping.My point is simply that Uber is wrong to continue to give this impression.  It was accurate when Uber started but it no longer is.  The passengers see the rates keep dropping but most dont associate that with less pay to the driver.  Somehow they either believe the flawed Uber logic that lower rates equal higher profit for the drivers...or they ignore it because it doesnt fit in with what they believe.  And they are happy to pay less while expecting the same level or even higher level of service than they were receiving when they used to pay x as much for the same ride.  And yes drivers are upset and its mostly with Uber....but if you were to spend some time driving you would understand the sense of entitlement and complete lack of courtesy for the driver and hisher time that most passengers have when using Uber....and the tipping aspect becomes a little clearer.For me if the passenger asks me to pick them up in a place that is safe to stop the vehicle they are ready at the exact place they asked me to pick them up when I arrive they are friendly not necessarily talkative they provide an address as a destination they are respectful of me my time and my property then I dont care if they tip.  I get maybe one passenger out of every  like this.  About  dont understand that the driver is going to drive exactly to the spot you asked them to go in the app so when you get there you realize its not the right place.  About  want me to pick them up at an unsafe location.  About  take more than  minutes to come to the vehicle.  About  insist on directing me rather than giving a destination address...and half of those get distracted and miss telling me at least one turn.  These things all add up to wasted time.  If you are going to waste my time then compensate me for it.  Im not getting paid by Uber for any of that time I spend waiting for you or looking for you...and Im risking my license by making illegal stops on your behalf.  ,jerseycity,cowgybr,3,t5_2rznh

4801711,0,t1_ctzr3ie,This fire was a couple weeks ago on Dales Ave. The closest unit Engine  on Sip amp Garrison was off duty for manpower. The second closest engine company Engine  on Bergen and Duncan was detailed to a parade. Most of the occupants were able to get themselves out before the fire department got there. They were barely able to get a ladder up to the woman before she was overcome. Imagine if this fire broke out in the middle of the night instead of  pm. The belt tightening is all well and good until someone gets hurt loses their house loses their business and worst case loses their life. Once a fire breaks out you only have a few minutes to escape. If the closest firehouse is browned out that clock has been ticking for a while before any is there to help. The second closest units might be at another emergency might have to fight  through more traffic might also be browned out. While the number of fires have gone down the fire department has a lot more responsibilities medical emergencies carbon monoxide emergencies hazmat technical rescue. The fire departments call volume is higher than ever. Couple that with new construction techniques and materials where new buildings can withstand much less fire before complete failure and collapse. As far as the economics this move isnt saving much if any money. So far nobody is losing their job. The same number of firefighters are working tonight as were this morning. Instead of being evenly spread throughout all the units in the city they browned out units and just moved those firefighters around so almost every unit has extra staff right now. This creates holes in coverage and increased response times for no benefit. Another economic point to consider is that once the fire department is reevaluated by the insurance services office this decreased staffing will lower the classification of the department. A lower classification will cause an increase in fire insurance costs for every business in the city. Im a firefighter but this has no economic effect on me. I posted this because I live in Jersey City and my family lives in Jersey City. This puts us at risk for no reason. ,jerseycity,ctzsnci,5,t5_2rznh

6774950,0,t3_48g6nb,A gripe about JC is the polices total disregard for the insane double parking.  It causes bad traffic situations to be so much worse.For instance in JSQ the right lane of JFKBergen Ave south right before Sip avenue always has cars parked there.  Its an actual rightturn only lane yet its used as parking and police do nothing about it.  In fact Ive seen a cop just hanging out while someone was double parked next to that lane since the whole lane had cars in the second from the right most lane.  Similar situation going north right in front of JSQ.  Ticketing all these people would be easy money AND it would help alleviate an already shitty traffic situation.Also it blows my mind when idiots double park and turn on their blinkers next to an EMPTY SPOT! As in these assholes could just park in the spot instead they are on the street next to the spot.  Oh you dont park in the spot cause its a driveway or theres a hydrant?  Great job asshole youre already blocking the drivewayhydrant why not park right next to the curb and just block it instead of blocking it AND the traffic lane.  Worse are the ones that double park next to what would be a legal open spot.,jerseycity,d0k82fr,6,t5_2rznh
7004393,0,t1_d19sp78,Driving straight down the NJ Turnpike from JC to exit  it takes about  to  min. tops to get into downtown Perth Amboy. Like the other poster said youre going against the grain of traffic so you are good. Tolls will set you back about  a day round trip plus gas. Gas us currently around . to . a gallon. Filling up in Perth Amboy will get you the best price JC is always the most expensive. You can take Route  which has no tolls but that highway often gets backed up with traffic. Getting to work on time may not be guaranteed.  Also if you are willing to park a little further on the waterfront side of town you can park for free in the residential area no more than a  min walk and not pay for parking. Just make sure to note the street cleaning schedules and park accordingly. This method would cost you roughly  a month plus gas. If you keep a car in Jersey City you most likely can get a resident permit and park on the street for free again noting the street cleaning schedule. However if you move into a building that on the books at city hall is said to come with a parking deck or private spots they wont give you a permit. You will have to pay for a private parking spot which will cost anywhere from  to  a month. Car insurance in NJ is roughly  to  a year on average depending on your car credit score and driving record. If you take the Path from Exchange Place Journal Square or Grove to Newark you can take the train directly to Perth Amboy. The train station is right in the middle of downtown and walkable to most places. Also there is  a taxi stand and bus stop right there too. If you are working in the Smith Streetdowntown area this is a good option. If you are working in the hospital or Best Buy warehouse areas then driving is your best option. Path costs . each way . if you get a  trip card for  unlimited monthly is  but can only be used once a hour train is  each way  per day or  for an unlimited monthly train ticket. So total monthly commuting cost will be  to  by taking the train and path. Bus would take forever no need for it. Path to Newark takes about  minutes train from Newark to Perth Amboy is  to  minutes plus wait time for the train to arrive so total is approximately  min to an hour.To get to Brooklyn from JC its going to be roughly the same amount of time depending on where in Brooklyn. The path to th st is about  to  min the changing to and taking the L or other subway line that go into Brooklyn will be another  min on average plus transfer and walking door to door time. So her commute may end up being as quick as  minutes or more than an hour depending on her final stop. Her cost will be  . each way for the path with a  trip card plus . for the subway into Brooklyn so . round trip each day or  for the month. Unless she goes for the unlimited monthly metro card thats . then total for the month would go up to  . or  with unlimited path card.Rents in Jersey City are quite high but you can get a large  bedroom in a luxury building for what you would be paying for a crappy studio in Manhattan. Average price for a  bedroom near the Exchange place or Grove St path is about  a month ie under a  min walk. If you are willing to go out a little further to a  to  min walk then you can find a  bedroom in a walk up for about .  These two areas are very lively safe and have lots of bars and restaurants at your doorstep. In Journal Square you can get a very nice luxury apartment steps away from the path there for about  a month. However its still a bit dodgy of an area mostly safe but not yet gentrified so a little ghetto still and doesnt have very many amenities within walking distance. Youd have to hop on the path and go to Grove st for restaurants shops and nightlife. Its only a  min ride but can be a pain. Also your best bet would be to do your food shopping near the Perth Amboy  Woodbridge area which would be another advantage to having a car.  Better selection nicer supermarkets and much cheaper prices than what you can find in JC.  Though with the new Asian Food market set to open in Grove st it could be a toss up. ,jerseycity,d1aajfs,3,t5_2rznh

7212716,0,t3_4e8v0k,Hi! Im a  yearold guy originally from Redondo Beach just north of ya! and Ive been living in JC  years now. Its great and its not as much of a culture shock as you think! In terms of neighborhoods Grove Street is my favorite. Its got a ton of really cool street art a mall nearby a good food and bar scene and a PATH station which means youre only a min ride from NYC  . Of course commuting to Trenton from here would be an absolute nightmare. Public trans would require taking a PATH train to Trenton and then switching to NJ Transit down to Trenton before getting wherever youre going. Itd probably be an hour and a half just to get to Trenton on most days not including the time itd take to get to work from there. Driving would be your only good option. You could take the turnpike but its an hour each way WITHOUT traffic. ,jerseycity,d1y12vq,1,t5_2rznh

10780638,0,t3_5u7i01,In my years commuting on the PATH these are my observations  Mondays and Fridays are the least busy outside of the weekend  Probably due to a lot of people working from home on these days.   Tuesdays and Thursdays are the busiest  Like the above a lot more people are typically traveling on T amp Th.   AM to AM are the busiest times any time before AM youre fine  After AM it tends to die down. I think this also correlates to commute times and what time people need to be at work. WTC lines are a lot busier about  minutes before  amp . rd St lines tend to be busier about a  minutes before  amp .   Youre better off swimming the Hudson than you are getting on the rd St train at Newport   When commuting to WTC Exchange Place is the best station to use  Due to  WTC bound trains coming through consistently. Plus you dont have much of a rd St crowd unless they plan on transferring at Newport.   At the Grove St station go to the last car if youre going to WTC. Go to the first car if youre going to rd St.  The rd St crowd congregates at the back and when they realize the train is short a car you have a lot of people trying to cram on  cars. I have yet to figure out why the last  cars for WTC bound trains arent as filled.   The Journal Squarerd St line needs to add an extra car at the end  See comment from uAsSubtleAsABrick  They need to open a ferry station at Newport  Could potentially relieve congestion and would provide a good alternative in times of PATH delays.   The NewarkWTC line seems to have the most issues eg. signal problems equipment faults  Beats me maybe longer route resulting in more potential for issues?  Half of the morning commuters at Newport are NYU students  Hard not to notice the bags and  of them FULLON SPRINTING down the ramps. Edit Added more context,jerseycity,ddry0di,33,t5_2rznh
10786544,0,t1_ddsjjvt,Generally speaking you cant board the train at Newport in the first two or three cars. The aforementioned NYU  foreign crowd tends to sprint down the stairs and stop within about  feet or so thus making the front of the train all but impossible to get on.Even when traveling to rd Street Ill inconvenience myself and walk towards the back of the train knowing Ill at least get on. If I try to board up at the front I dont have a prayer and may end up needing to wait for the next train.And speaking of the cattle car situation its so sad but I also find myself having to fight off people trying to board the JSQbound train at Newport in the afternoon while Im trying to get off. Its amazing how few people actually clear the doorway and also how many folks try boarding the train while theres clearly a line of people trying to get off. At least every other day I have to essentially push someone backwards to get off the train. I hate doing it but otherwise Ill be stuck on the car.,jerseycity,ddsjy6d,2,t5_2rznh

10797820,0,t3_5u7i01,I dont know of a solution here  jersey city real estate has just exploded over the years since Ive moved here in . The PATH already sends trains every minute or so during rush hour. Its gotten to the point where if I dont go into the city early to use the gym I just wait until after  to take the PATH. I board at Grove but the crowd at Newport generally has no regard for personal space and will cram themselves into whatever nook they can find rather than wait for the next train. Though I dont necessarily blame them if they have been waiting for a while. People seem as though they would rather push you onto the tracks than take the next train and try cutting in front of you even if you are already standing on the yellow line. ,jerseycity,ddtpuue,2,t5_2rznh

I know gentrification is mostly a result of Americans flocking back to cities which is good for the environment and probably good for society in general. And Im pretty sure that the displacement everyone laments is more from wealth disparity than supply and demandlots of wealthy people pushing up prices lots more unwealthy who cant come close to affording those prices and increasingly few in between.
