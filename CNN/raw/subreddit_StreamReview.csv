Another thing about the webcam try to adjust some settings like exposure and that kind of stuff idk if that is possible on the console When i watched you in a match with shootingfighting etc. the game was overpowering your voice. Either try to talk more outloud it sounded you were talking to yourself really soft or turn down the game sound.I hope this quick tips will help you further.,StreamReview,d0z8x6e,1,t5_393a3

I am confident in my ability to get the right streamer to the point you are at but I still need to learn what real things people can do to break through to the next level. I have theories taken from other platforms but I want to see if a few changes will help you get there. Nothing radical... Its more like connecting the dots and being more intentional overall. ,StreamReview,d2u4d66,1,t5_393a3
