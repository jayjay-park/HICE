66969,0,t3_1u330f,Awesome theory and would make for an interesting story but I doubt it. Even if it did get out of the range of the sprawl before explosion and if it is still functioning heres the deal. One the Ishimura is not made for combat its slow cumbersome and planet cracking is an exact science requiring gravity tethers to be mounted onto the target which takes quite some time. And two warning spoilers blood moons are not ok with people screwing with them and one much less the three or four we saw at the end of awakening would rip the ishimira apart.

109643,0,t3_1v74dk,All the stats do go above max but the damage increase is not noticeable because its overkill. One of my main guns is the assault rifle at upper tool and flamethrower at lower tool with stasis coating. Always put tools with the quicker reload on upper tool because the guns reload base stat is based off the upper tool. I use flamethrower mostly as an emergency stasis burst on necros and then back away.

6829031,0,t3_499ngv,I found the first overall more scary but that was largely because of the mechanics and the atmosphere of game.  It seemed like ammo was more scarce in general. if you havent started you notice some changes pretty quickly in the game than the second  The ammo count makes things a lot scarier due to the fact that on harder difficulties sometimes you just have to run.  You Isaac seem much more unprepared than you do in the next two games and also are alone much more of the time due to the story. That also plays a part in the atmosphere.  It feels like you really are just an engineer dropped into this nightmare that you never would have guessed.  However the atmospheric qualities come out a lot more if you are capable of getting into the game and letting yourself be creeped out. lights off and no distractions really helps there  So Id have to say overall the first was my favorite but then the second one changed it some and was definitely a close second.  just to say I did play the second one a lot more than the first as it handled easier and was easier to jump into,DeadSpace,d0qdd2o,2,t5_2r5qf

While theres no definitive end there is actually a plot.Yes I did because MGSV is rather straight forward you were nearly killed  years ago by a person. You were tricked into think you were someone else important. You kill the person who nearly killed you and then go on the hunt for the man who you believe ordered the hit you find out that person isnt responsible and go on to found a military nationstate in South africa until youre killed by a pupil of yours who is the son of the man you though you were until that point. Whats incoherent there? If you then put in in the context of MGS as a whole it may feel incoherent but nothing really sticks out as truly incoherent in MGSV.Your opinion on that last sentence.
