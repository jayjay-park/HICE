You asked me to provide you with another descriptor because you couldnt handle me saying they do some when taking a collision from a stationary object to the face while going fast.Some certainly matters but some isnt necessarily enough to save your life especially if we are talking about direct impact to the head by a large pointed stationary object. If you trust that helmets do more than some in such a situation please feel free to shoot a video of yourself moving at  mph taking a heavy stationary object directly to the face and walking away from it in a fashion demanding a stronger descriptor for a helmet than providing some protection and I will concede and give you the thumbs up you so direly seem to want.

Youre not watching the ball youre watching the body language of the player holding it and there are a limited number of things that can happen from any particular stance. You might notice sometimes that the camera will twitch a bit when a football quarterback does a pump fake. D RC helis on the other hand can be flown in incredibly unpredictable ways.
