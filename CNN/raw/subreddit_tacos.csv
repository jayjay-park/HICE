2634797,0,t1_cn29jrr,During the Lime Crisis I had a lot of lemon with Taco Truck tacos. Its forgivable. Especially if you are in Brussels. Damn. Im glad the Mexicans have invaded culinarily for you. Amazing food.You can always tell the best Mexican restaurants because of Mexican customers. If I go to a place and it only has white people making and eating the food I move on. I grew up in Albuquerque NM and have taken this as gospel every since then. And another sign of shit Mexican food especially tacos is TOO MUCH CILANTRO. It is an ingredient not the star of the show. Too much says that they are covering up shit food.,tacos,cn2i2ih,0,t5_2qm20
