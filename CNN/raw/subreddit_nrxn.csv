See wiki on land tenure  Also note this line In order to legitimise the notion of the Crowns paramount lordship a legal fiction  that all land titles were held by the Kings subjects as a result of a royal grant  was adopted. legal fiction? The alternative is commons. Also note isnt this curious? Monarchical ownership of all is renounced then we get capitalism then socialism? Something not smell off about that?,nrxn,d5bq5xt,1,t5_3f3dc

8709650,0,t1_d6t4v97,gt This goes back to the Greeks at the latest. I find Nietzsches schematic analysis from the Genealogy of Morals insightful there is deterministic morality for slaves and children and voluntarist morality for independent peers and which of the two dominates is a matter of politics understood broadly.Pretty much this. Re the Greeks one of the most telling encounters I had with a professional philosopher was on the metaphysics latent within Homer and this has bearing on the idea of masterslave morality.In our discussion I put forth textual evidence from Iliad that the Greeks had some notion of incompatibilism and libertarian free will long before even the presocratics which caused him to run off the rails and become uncharacteristically for him hostile and insulting. If youre curious the evidence was in Achilles choice between two fates among other passages. Anyway he proceeded to talk down to me repetitiously and pedantically explaining the obviousthat fate is the engine of classical tragedyand how I must simply not have read very carefully. The most striking thing about this exchange was the sudden turn from a measured scholarly tone to something more like what youd expect from a petulant child.The connection here with master vs. slave morality is that I see a degeneration present even in the two works of Homer on just this very point. Take for example the choice of Achilles which is at once unprecedented in all of Greek traditionthat he could choose either glory or comfort irrespective of the gods willand also perhaps the prime example of virtue in that tradition. In Iliad he is presented with this choice the crucial point around which the whole Trojan war turns and the notion of libertarian free will is not only alive and well but in a very real way central to the archaic Greek mythos. However in Odyssey Achilles is confronted in the underworld by Odysseus and regrets having made or had the choice he tells us better to live as a slave among the living than a king among the dead and nowhere else in that poem do we find so much as a hint of the sort of independence of spirit characterized by his choice in Iliad. This is quite a step down from overruling the will of the gods to preferring to live as a slave.I have to think that somewhere in the leftists heart he knows that voluntarist free will undermines his whole ethos and thus he reacts whether consciously or not with hostility toward it.,nrxn,d6ucc4q,1,t5_3f3dc
