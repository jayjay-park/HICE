94492,0,t3_1v5zuz,Not trying to make light of the matter  I know how unsettling this kind of stuff can be  but it sounds like a great setupopening for a mystery novel.  Youd have an immensely relatable likeable heroine with a sense for humor some help from white wine strongwilled if that old lady hates it I am obviously working it but an achilles heel as well dunno  maybe a reluctance to allow for the supernatural possibility?  Thus trying to rationalize e.g. along the lines of she must have found out about me because I was in local newspapers  she is a stalker.  Then you let your heroine investigate and bam! The rational explanation is demonstrably wrong one would have to work out the details but one way or another one could probably work it out so that stalking is no longer a plausible answer.  Ever stranger little things continue to happen to our heroine.  Her mother  fianc  best friend urges her to stop pursuing the matter.  But she doggedly carries on.  Finds Lorettas grandson.  And then...If you like this kind of stuff you might find The Holy by Daniel Quinn enjoyable and in case you are aware of him because of the notoriety of his earlier Socratic dialogs sold as novels and did not like those be assured that the preachiness in The Holy is dialled down to almost zero.  Very funny zany stuff  and in spite of having been published in the s with a very s feel probably because of Quinns only very sketchy understanding of how rich people live speak and think and this one is full of rich people  hence lots of James Bondesque mansions in the desert and because of the constant pouring of drinks.

110357,0,t1_ceqzk59,Real life scenarioI was invited to someones apartment once to pick my wife up.  When I walked in the girl accused me of kicking her dog it was humping my leg  it was a chihuahua puppy so it slid about  inches across the floor when I shook it off so she started punching me  over amp over but she was a  girl and Im  lbs so I didnt retaliate.  I walked over to the couch to get my wife to come with me but she was too high and just sat there watching the whole thing go down Saturday is her  year anniversary of sobriety  its changed our lives so much.  At this point the girls  boyfriend comes out of the bedroom and comes at me with a pool cue so I hit him twice.  He stopped I turned around and walked out as the girl was ripping my shirt off of me.I called the cops since Id just been assaulted.  Guess who went to jail?  Me.  They accused me of breaking and entering they kicked their own door in before the cops showed up destruction of property and assault and battery.  The charges were dropped but I had to spend  on attorneylegal fees and pay the guys hospital bills I hit him twice in self defense  he went in for xrays and such.  Bone bruises on his face.  Another .  So the whole thing cost me almost  grand a few days jail time and the whole time I was fighting that it was on my record which made it really hard to find a job.The moral of the story is this  Dont depend on the authorities to come to your rescue.  Theyre just there to clean up the mess and do the paperwork.  Solve your own problems.,self,ceqzwed,7,t5_2qh96

181101,0,t3_1w65fc,Okay. Pause.Youre probably lying to yourself. We all do but this one might be keeping you from fixing some critical flaw in yourself.gt Its a Saturday night and Im a college student with nowhere to go.Theres a world full of places to go youre choosing to not go to them.gt Im drinking alone in the living area of my dorm room apartment style. Thats your choice too isnt it?gt The thing is  I do NOT seem like a pitiful person on the outside. I am objectively good looking although I certainly dont feel that way  of the time I go to an excellent school I dress well etc. For most of my life I expected to become a ballet dancer. Retired at  because of malnutritionrelated osteoporosis and general unhealthiness.The fact that theres no maybe type modifier there says something to me. How are you so certain about how you seem to other people? When people actually hear what people think of them either physically or personalitywise theyre often shocked at the disparity yet youre absolutely certain of what the world sees how is that? ...or maybe you just didnt think to add any kind of maybe to that statement and Im overreading too. Anyways...gt Im deleting this account relatively soon because Ive already exposed too much of myself on here. There is a such thing as TMI. When you have to worry about being outed IRL off things youve put on Reddit you may have passed that point.gt Both IRL and on Reddit Ive been very open about having recovered from a serious lifethreatening case of anorexia. IRL Ive done it because Im passionate about reducing the stigma of mental illness and to make myself available to anyone else who may be suffering on Reddit Ive talked about it because its such a major part of my life and nobody here knows me.Nothing wrong with being a passionate advocate but...gt Even on Reddit though my posts always get buried. Ive never connected with anyone in real life or even on here where I can only use words and not be judged by appearance or whatever else. Im just as unpopular online as I am in person.Theres a difference between being passionate and being a zealot. If you having survived anorexia becomes a constant drumbeat in all of your posts if they seem preachy selfcentered or self focused or turns everything on the subject into an opportunity to play the victim accuse others of victimhating or blaming or generally renders you the one in the room who always has to be the expert you will not get a good response. Check your posts for those tendencies before you wonder whats going on.gt Im struggling. Im depressed anxious and still struggle with my eating disorder. Im a budding alcoholic. Sorry to hear all of that. I truly hope you find balance in your life and get a chance to to attack the underlying issues that cause these problems.gt I got a death threat in rrunning once because I spoke up in support of trigger warning tags.Sounds like possibly an overreaction to a possible overreaction. Meaning its not cool to threaten to kill people but so many people use trigger warnings as a suppressor to discussion and that can infuriate people as well.gt Ive openly admitted to my ED on Facebook and in my coed fraternity and Im afraid that has made people wary of me.Are you sure thats what it is? Plenty of people have had these problems and for the most part in my experience the first reaction is an outpouring of support. Facebook is notorious for being fertile ground for harvesting support for even the most trivial issues.gt Although this post would seem to indicate otherwise Im not selfcentered. I spent most of my weekends on service projects. Im planning on joining the Peace Corps after graduation. My passion is directed towards the humane treatment of the mentally ill.None of that means youre not selfcentered it means youre not selfish. You do all kinds of things for others but really all that can also be very selfcentered. Some people do those kinds of things not because they care about those theyre serving but to really amplify their own selfimage or look good to others. The net effect is the same people get helped but that doesnt make their work not selfcentered.gt I dont have any siblings or even cousins. My friends have all either given up forgotten or too annoyed with me to even bother. Does it occur to you that there might be a reason for that? What do you think it is? Have you asked?gt One time I posted on rwhatsmyimpression and someone messaged me and said that I am a Good Person. I screenshotted it because that was the nicest anyone has been to me in a long long time.You are probably a good person. Again that doesnt speak top a single one of your personality flaws as good  and bad are about morality not personality. I know some very good people who have shitty personalities and some very evil people who have incredibly attractive personality traits. Its like bananas some look rotten when theyre perfectly edible inside and others look perfect and are rotten to the core.gt I am so lonely so hopeless and so alone. Im awkward as all getout and Ive tried to fix it but cant. I dont want pity since people like me are a natural occurrence in any society. Again I feel bad for you thats not pity its empathy. It would suck to live that way. But awkwardness can fixed if you have the ability to recognize emotions in others like any other skill you have to learn it or be taught how to change how you act to encourage the reactions you really want. Most people kinda catch on instinctively but some dont. Maybe youre a little tone deaf to how your actions affect people.gt I must be horrible in some way but I dont know what that way is. Nobody has the heart to tell me. Someone always does. Ask the rudest meanest person you know to really tell you the truth. I doubt theyll hold back. gt Ive loved being balletballoon for the past half a year and I hate giving it up but I cant even handle this anymore. Im sure that this like all my other comments will get buried but if anyone reads this... thank you. Youre good.You dont know me youve no idea of if Im good or even if Im right. But I hope you at least will pause and ask yourself and others some serious questions that will give you some serious answers because what you see feel and do may be being masked by your own emotional state and the denial of the truth may be not allowing you to be healthy.Does that problem sound familiar?

Like you said its a belief and there is no place for belief in the public school system. Instead of teaching them a particular set of beliefs we should teach them to believe what they want to believe. I tried to go in with an open mind. I can be swayed by a decent argument or at least see a point of view. All Hams evidence was is him saying hey look this guy is a scientist and hes a creationist who cares that none of his research is relevant to this argument at all and theres a book that gives us that answer. Opening my mind to his ideas would be putting myself in a more close minded view.

I get panic attacks when I am lying in bed trying to sleep and they last pretty long lots of intrusive thoughts mostly about death or freaking out about all the chores I have to dobills I have to pay.

I also get them while driving but it is a bad idea to take benzos and drive so I just try to get to a safe place asap.Id love to go to therapy and try CBT but my insurance doesnt cover it.

522382,0,t1_cfzn9mh,Because I went to college and I have eyes and Im not retarded.Im sure there are plenty of people who are masters of drinking vast quantities of booze in public and appearing  stone cold sober but generally if you or the people you with are drinking enough that you draw the attention of cops you probably arent that good at hiding it. Keep in mind we are also talking specifically about minors.Also generally if you arent completely incoherent or drunkenly belligerent while the cops are asking you questions and you dont have any visible containers then you probably wont get in trouble. But that still doesnt mean that the cop didnt realize you were drunk it just means that youre not causing any problems or hes got better things to do than dealing with you at the moment.,self,cfznexl,3,t5_2qh96

533032,0,t3_206qvp,I moved home after my stepmom died to help out with the family business that she and my dad owned together for the last  years. The first few months were really tough for me  her name was all over the documentation for everything her handwriting was everywhere. I burst out crying in the bank when I went to cash my first paycheck which dad forgot to sign and they called the office to confirm it was a real paycheck asking to speak to her the clerk not knowing she had passed away two months prior. Its been a year and a half. I just got off the phone with someone who insisted the office manager an old family friend was my dads wife. No she died in . These conversations used to be body blows. Theyve come to be needles that still prick from time to time occasionally drawing a little blood.I grew up in a household that had a nearly visible hole in the family fabric  a car accident killed my grandfather and yearold aunt and nearly killed my mother when she was  and I grew up in my grandmothers home hearing about the accident which happened  years before I was born and living among the stillshellshocked survivors. My grandmother went into a nursing home a couple of years ago and lost her house to foreclosure. While helping to clean it out I came across in her important papers all the memorabilia from the funerals and a diary she kept at the time plus years after the fact. She remarried and had a full professional life after the accident but thats just a wound that never seemed to fully heal for anyone.My mom dealt with survivors guilt and clinical depression for decades. I wish shed been able to process it better and at a younger age had more grief resources and mental health treatment available throughout her life because it was something that seems to have damaged her entire life. I feel lucky in that I have a supportive boyfriend who listened to me patiently and moved with me to my home state plus a large family and a group of people who worked with and loved my stepmom as well as several siblings who also knew her as a second mother for  years and weve been able to grieve together. I cant imagine how isolated my mother felt at  with what she went through while the family was in the process of moving to my grandmothers hometown that she hadnt been in for  years. Everyones grief is their own but talking to others may help. Talking to a professional therapist may help. Whatever helps your process and helps you keep on living find a reason to keep on living take ahold of it.,self,cg0v2c7,1,t5_2qh96
535311,0,t1_cg140ox,Its already improving. My doctor was very aggressive in pretreatment. She put me on Restasis from the time of consult until three months after surgery. Its normally a medication for people with chronic dry eyes but has been shown to help in the healing of people who have Lasik. I finished with the antibiotics Sunday and yesterday was my last day with the steroids. Now its Restsis twice daily and artificial tears in the vials not the small bottles. I was taking the tears more than once per hour for the first several days. But today things have been really good. About once ever two hours and some extra if I feel any dryness. They also wouldnt allow contacts for  days before where some places say a week.I had also considered it for over  years but the last few Ive noticed my near vision getting worse when corrected. When wearing my glasses I would just take them off when using my phone or anything else up close. This way I only need readers for close vision instead of getting bifocals or progressives.I dont think the surgery was awful  more like weird. I ended up taking the Xanax they offered but more because they said it would help me sleep for a couple of hours afterwards. Im not sure if it did anything as I wasnt that anxious to begin with. Some people dont have pain  mine progressed from one hour after surgery until about  hours after. I slept through the first couple of hours of it. But the last hour I just laid with my eyes closed which were watering furiously. But after that fourth hour the pain dropped almost to nothing in about  minutes.

596381,0,t3_20yz3c,Hey there fella Im gonna lay out my thoughts on your situation. Okay so first off I understand it sucks when you work hard at something and you still dont feel like you are reaping the benefits you want. The only advice I can give is to try and focus on other good things that are happening in your life. If you can focus on the good parts of your life you can balance that feeling of annoyance. From my own experience today in fact it is very easy to begin thinking in a very downer sort of way when things arent going your way. When this happens I find focusing on something else eg what is good in your life can help to put your problems in perspective. Like if you think that there are people all around the world who dont even have a place to live or food to eat it can help you to realise how lucky you are.So in summary I think just keep trying for what you want coz thats the only you will get it. But dont get yourself down if you havent reached it yet. There are lots and lots of people in the world who have it waaaayyyy worse than you do so try to keep that in mind when you get frustrated by the way things are going for you.Also feel free to PM me if you want to talk further have a proper convo ,self,cg8299b,3,t5_2qh96

Taken from outside a window into a dimly lit room isnt likely to be professional grade photography.  Weve all had mornings when we wake up thinking that our behavior the previous night has changed our life forever.  Were wrong about that  times out of  even when were sincere in our belief in it.

Hell maybe youll find that youll do a little stalking yourself when love doesnt go your way.  Embarrassment is what we feel when our behavior falls below our self image.  You can expect that to happen a lot.  Dont be too hard on yourself.  Life is ultimately about what you do next not about what you did.  As I say to my son Dont beat yourself up about it.

632152,0,t3_21dsx6,You have made some life choices that have currently placed you in a difficult and lonely situation.  However the bright side of this is that you are young and have the majority of your life left to live.There are other positives here that you should recognize instead of focusing on the negative aspects.  First and foremost you have a sense of personal responsibility that a lot of people your age do not have.  In every statement you have made you use the term I.  You recognize that your affirmative choices in life lead you to where you are.  If past choices have now lead you to a lonely and unhappy place then future choices can lead you to a brighter and more fulfilling place.  Another thing to recognize is that you were able to not only determine that you were in an abusive relationship you were able to leave that relationship.A good place to start would be to draw a road map for yourself.  On that road map have small goals large goals and out of this world goals.  What do you want out of life?  What do you want to accomplish?  Do you want to quit smoking?  Do you want to make friends?  Do you want to go back to school?After you place all your destinations on the map for your road trip try to find some pit stops and attractions you want to make.  Lets call these microgoals.  If you look at accomplishing your goals in small steps it doesnt make the overall picture seem so out of reach.You have so much life to live.  If you make the decision that your life from this point forward will be different and do something every day towards that you will see things turn around.  Just remember it can be one tiny step and choice each day.  Things wont turn around in a day a week or a month.  it took longer than that to get to where you are.  You just have to keep making positive choices and moving forward.,self,cgc4k3m,1,t5_2qh96
632724,0,t3_21e7qv,I remember reading in this great book about willpower how basically the thought of having something new the hope and positivity that comes with the prospect of making a transformationeven one driven by the acquiring of a physical objectcan produce dopamine levels comparable to when you actually make a transformation. So basically your brain feels good when it thinks that its improving itself and buying something makes it feel like theres improvement happening. And then once the thing comes and it doesnt actually bring improvement as most physical objects wont your brain goes back into a rut until it finds something else that looks like it has transformative abilities.Its not a completely useless stimulus pattern though. If you can feed your mind on the promise of positive feelings from things that actual will improve your life and then actually do them you can make yourself happy while keeping your brain chemically satisfied too.,self,cgc6wi8,1,t5_2qh96

He taught me lessons in this life that I will never forget and still try to pass on to my own friends and family even now. Your son now at a huge moment in his life will remember everything you have taught him and guided him towards and I know that as he takes even more strides on his hike in life you will be there every step of the way both physically and in spirit.

820231,0,t3_23annk,Holy scripture and what Jesus actually said are two completely different things. Jesus never uttered any words against homosexuality. In fact if you are under the impression that homosexuals are of a lesser sort  Jesus only ever told people to embrace the riffraff the prostitutes tax men the vagrants et cetera.On a literal note however when read the scripture in its original language with the cultural context there is no word for homosexual. A lot of the meanings in the scriptures have been lost in translation. If you ask any theologian who has studied the Bible extensively on this subject they will tell you that what had originally been intended was for man to not have sex with young boys. That was the original intent of those passages. In the same sense of losing context is passages on premarital sex. Premarital sex was bad because people were married on average between . Before they were married they would essentially be little kids again this goes back to not having sex with children. So homosexuality can have a holy union under the name of the church because Jesus never said anything against it nor does the Bible reference homosexuals in the way that modern Christians think it does. It is only through modern perceptions that the meanings have changed and pastorspriestsclergy interpret it as they understandfeel rather than what was meant. ,self,cgxigna,1,t5_2qh96

854104,0,t1_ch1cm6y,gtBBC is good for a daily brief at whats going on in the world.Id question how thats any more informative than having some windbag on Fox news boasting and bawling into your face.A flood in India an explosion in Baghdad a plane crash in Malaysia a study says X causes cancer a study says Y cures cancer. These things might as well be fictional for how much they actually matter to the average news consumer how much they remember and how much they understand the wider context. Stories fly off the screen and the viewers mind like rain on a windshield.BBC News online still follows the same basic heuristic as every other mainstream news organization. They will never reduce or increase the amount of news they put out based on the number of important things happening. They will not give an important story  pages or  minutes and a lesser story  because the people the audience theyre trying to get doesnt have the attention span. Theyll put out exactly the same amount of news every day because their job is to entertain not inform.Right now on the BBC news site theres a post about Obama playing football with a robot and a  people who are touring a baby around the world. Even the ostensibly important news about Ukraine isnt really news its just an excuse to rehash whats already happened in Ukraine and act as if theres been a development.I cant remember the last thing I saw in the news that actually improved my understanding about the world or changed the way I live. Its just an extremely basic list of thing that have happened this is happening here now this has happened here now look over here this is happeningTheres too much happening in the world right now for that kind of news to have any meaning.

918191,0,t1_ch8k8sl,Im not saying that the judge or a member of the jury should have to physically carry out the execution. Im just saying that as a society we shouldnt take every measure we can to shield ourselves from the reality of what were doing. We are killing human beings. Somehow we seem to think that doing this as a drug overdose is more humane or civilized. But the bullet wounds are not what makes a firing squad barbaric. The swinging corpse is not what makes a hanging barbaric. And on the flip side no amount of sterilized needles will make an execution by lethal injection not barbaric. If youre gonna kill someone kill them and own up to the fact that youre doing it. Everyone would find it disturbing if we still shot people to death or hanged them by the neck. So we give them a drug overdose so people dont really have to confront the harsh reality of whats going on. So theres no blood and theres no sickening crash as someones drops out of the bottom of a gallows but theres still a dead person killed by the state. At least with an old school execution there was no denying what you were doing. So when I say society should swing the sword itself what I mean is that they should look very closely at what happened in Oklahoma last week and acknowledge that we are pumping people full of poison to end their lives. We shouldnt try to dress it up as some sort of medical procedure. That man last week was strapped to a gurney shot full of poison acquired by some unknown means and made to suffer for an hour while still conscious until he died not of a drug overdose but of a heart attack.

Hes left the story and you need to look forward rather than back.  My Internetstranger simplistic advice for you is this Find something major to change in your life.  Maybe its your look or your friends or what you do at the weekend.  Whatever.  But make some change and then let that change spark other changes.  Youre in a tough spot.  Maybe your depression is the kind that needs chemicals to balance it out.  Or maybe its a natural reaction to simply not being in an enjoyable place.  Try taking responsibility for moving toward an enjoyable place.  Dont mock the things you find mockable.  Dont judge yourself and youll find youre less judgmental of others.  Stop judging others and youll find youre less hard on yourself. can be tough.  If youre anything like me then by  youll have a much firmer sense of who you are.

Its all about confidence and who you think you are and doing the things above are great for confidence and only through being confident can you show people how great you are. Imagine that ease you have when you are wearing your pjs and watching telly now imagine you had that much serenity in your life confidence gives you that. So if you want to find someone worthy of you you need to see yourself as the precious person that you are. And in order to do that you need to gain confidence. Life is really what you make it out to be. Chin up. And why would it be awkward to see him again have fun with this make light of it. So? So what if you had feelings for him? Thank him for being clear about it and move on. Dont lose a good friend. Just forgive and forget. Forgive yourself. It happens. And honey if you want to be single be single it does not matter if you dont have a boyfriend. You dont need anyone to complete you and thats what you are searching for. You need to complete yourself and then find someone who appreciates you. If you talk about yourself saying youre not a spring chicken that means you have issues regarding beauty. Fix them better yourself and be confident. Men will come and go they are not the main goal.

A lot of people can also function just fine with  hours of sleep each night so all together you should have  extra hours in your day.If you live in a metropolitan area you need to learn how to talk to strangers find the free events paper and start forcing yourself to  events a week until you have a hobby.  There are often also sports leagues for adults which are a great way to get out and meet people  .  Finally there are things you should be learning to improve your own well being in your downtime after work like Going to the gym learning how to cook  complete meals perfectly and adopting a personal project you can work on an hour nightly blog  website  journal  etsy store  academic topic  etc.Doing those things will create a good balance between work and life make you available to other groups of people and give you a base of topics you can talk to others about.

1620690,0,t1_cjjfv2h,I am so very sad for your pain and loss. I hope I can help in some small way.. I was the same way when I had to deal with my crisis. Defiant dont need it etc. I dug my feet in for a few years until I realized that I needed some help resolving my crisis and that I could not come up with a workable solution on my own as shown by how I had fucked up so many times in the last years.Believe me I tried so hard to fix myself after what happened and every time I thought I had a breakthrough I would fall again. I kept thinking Id stumble upon a great idea or conclusion or thought that would help me out of my hole that I had dug. Every time I hit a precipice it was simply okay not good not great. I needed more. Once I accepted that I needed help talking to a kindhearted therapist for even less than  months gave me the changes and perspective I needed. I never really felt comfortable in the office but what I learned about myself really helped me cope with the ups and downs of my extreme emotions and gave me a sense that I was not crazy that I just had some things to sort out.  There are ways to change and they are scary but it can be done. Getting it out on the table was my tactic and then we just talked about stuff and had real conversations about life and what I can do to make it more fulfilling. Your experience may differ but I thnk that therapy is not just talking to someone its hearing yourself struggle and wanting to help that person.Therapists are trained to help you deal with a loss such as this. They have experience with others who have had similarly painful experiences. For the most part a good one will coax you through the grieving process to end up with a happy outcome.   This can be overcome. You will smile again.,self,cjjgc76,22,t5_2qh96

The best thing you can do for yourself is to avoid measuring your own worth by comparing yourself to others. Its never a fair comparison. Try to set your own goals and disregard the apparent accomplishments of others. I know from experience just how hard this can be but you need to start somewhere and its worth the effort.Ive also struggled with a lack of self confidence. Ive come to realize just how important apparent confidence and personality is in meeting all people not just women. I used to see unattractive dudes with girlfriend and wonder how the hell they did it. But I realize now that in many cases personality trumps appreance. Try to find something you can do to improve yourself. I started going running for example. Its all psychological but it still makes me feel a little more confident. It doesnt have to be physical.

1956166,0,t3_2h0wdm,Stop pretending like it is a big deal. Its really not dude.  I guarantee youre making women see spookier and harder to talk to than they areTry watching how to have a conversation like a man by nick sparks dont worry hes not some pickup artist scumbag.  And just try talking to women and giving them attention without ulterior motives.  Dont suppress your emotions then if you like a girl express it and if she shoots you down early on in your interest for her the pain of getting over it fades quickly.Look Ive never been mocked or made fun of for asking out a girl since high school. What changed from high school I after was I learned how to ask.  You will be made fun of if you seem to pander to her or act scared.  If youre just hanging out and youre having a good conversation you can ask.  If she says no whatever dude its no big deal.  Just be cool with it.There is only one skill that you need to develop an understanding of body language. What you say in words is not super relevant in flirting.  But you need to be sensitive to HER body language.  Women do not like to give verbal commands they will communicate through how they position themselves.  If youre pushing a boundary that makes her uncomfortable she will always give you a polite no even if her words are ambiguous.  You only become creepy when you dont pick up on her body language.The best way to get used to body language is to just talk to women.  Most women love talking about their lives husbands family whatever I know Im maybe being sexist by saying you can distinguish what men and women enjoy talking about but hey in all of my years of communicating Ive found a fairly consistent pattern in good ways to discuss topics across the sexes.  Do it for a few weeks talk to women and be empathetic and emphatic and learn how to communicate on all planes words voice body language facial expressions and then start trying to flirtFlirting is easy and absolutely the funnest part of meeting girls.  Remember the real emotion is communicated in body language.  You can say I hate you so much and mean it as a joke but if your body language is stiff it will come across awkward not cute.  If your body language indicates friendliness and interest it becomes a game.  Women love role playing like this do you remember playing house?And dont be afraid to just be damn.  Being completely free with who you are is far more attractive than molding yourself to be who people think you should be.  Its simple people always know youre wearing a fakeass mask.  Eventually when you try being open you will learn that negativity is just not a thing that people enjoy.  No one wants to hear long rants about negative shit.  No one!  So that means you shouldnt be judgmental.That will develop on its own as you talk to people though.  Remember that expressing disapproval and negativity are distinct if a girl starts telling me a long story about her ex Ill send body language to communicate tht I disapprove of this topic.  If youre sensitive to the woman she will be sensitive back to you when you try to direct the conversation through your body language.You can talk about anything with a woman.  I love talking with women I hate listening to womens problems over a certain ratio of the time Im not a dick here.  People can tell me about their problems but I have a limit.  Intuition to people who arent very social says its rude to not listen but if youre hating the conversation then you become an unfun partner to talk to.  In a sense redirecting the conversation is a good thing because you cant tango with passion when one person is unhappy.  Make sense?  If you get more serious in a relationship I would still limit how much you allow yourself to absorb negative conversation topics.I dont know.  Im just talking at this point.  What I mean is you can have a girlfriend you just need to be brave and develop yourself a little.  Its hard and scary seemingly but you get over it,self,ckox641,1,t5_2qh96

2012161,0,t3_2hqskq,collecting is a strange modern instinct. I dont know why. I did it with hockey cards as a kid but as an adult Ive always felt a bit repulsed at the idea of hoarding Discs and Tapes. Sometimes you see an amazing curated collection and that makes some sense to me its a collection of knowledge like a private library. But so often its just a consumer behaviour a spending and owning instinct. It seems like guys young guys in particular are more prone to this type of consumer collecting.As I get older I get rid of the junk and instead buy only things that have  real value. For example I just moved to a new apartment. Things like bookshelfs and bedside tables I am borrowing or buying used. But for our living room I found an Algerian rug online and bought it. Its  years old and will live beyond my ownership. Also I need a stereo but I refuse to buy something that will be disposable in five years. Instead Im online playing the long game waiting for a good set of PSB speakers and a high quality amp used old at a good price. It isnt instant but what I get in the end will be well made and appreciated not only by me but by whoever has it next.The act of buying things and owning things is OK its how our system of commerce functions its what keeps our families employed.But collecting junk made of wasteful materials that will never be appreciated by future generations... that makes me sad. ,self,ckvnuva,1,t5_2qh96

2052876,0,t1_cl0nfx5,Drugs amp mental relaxation are generally less synonymous than you think. People particularly the homeless do a lot of different types of drugs and not necessarily to relax or escape from the stress of being homeless. Lets not forget either that when that guy sobers up his shittier than normal homeless guy problems will still be there. People with jobs a place to live etc. are generally better problem solvers so this reasoning that everyone can benefit from the experience of recreational drug use for relaxation sounds kinda flimsy. If in the original story the homeless guy said he was going to buy PCP with that money OP did the homeless guy amp society a disservice on some level. The point that the homeless guy made in OPs story is highly conditional and not really any way to go about handling all instances of giving money to homeless people for drugs. ...And I say all of this as someone who condones legalization and recreational use of many currently illegal drugs. ,self,cl0rl23,9,t5_2qh96

The surgeon ignored us when we talked about it at every damn visit. He told me to get off the internet. I got him to a gastroenterologist who did agree with me when we told him the symptoms and he did an MRCP first because it was noninvasive. That found the stricture! That gastroenterologist did an ERCP next and a sphincterotomy hoping to help. He then referred us back to the surgeon for repair. Back to the surgeon we went with the proof that the surgical clips caused a problem. The surgeon laughed me out of his office saying theres no way he messed up. All we wanted was for him to help us by removing the clips or getting us to someone who would help. That GI doctor was amazing. I called him back and told him what the surgeon said and did. He referred us to another surgeon who looked at the records and said it was over her head but she knew where to send us. That is where the liver transplant center came into the picture.

He said it would take him  paychecks to be able to set aside the money.I came home from school every day to cuddle my cat and tell him that he just needed to wait a little bit longer before we could get him help. Then finally the day came. Saturday morning my father younger sister and myself piled into the car with my cat and we took him to the vet. They said they would need to run some tests and they would call when everything was done. We go home get the phone call a few hours later and come back for the results.He had a tumor in his liver. The only thing they could do was a surgery for around  grand and even then they couldnt guarantee anything. I immediately started crying because it was so unfair. I ran out of the vets office and cried alone in the car while my dad made the decision to have my childhood pet and best friend put down.I never got to say goodbye.Sometimes even if you can get them the medical care they need theres still nothing that can be done.

Youre not strong in math so youll never be an astrophysicist. Im short so ill never be an NBA player. But the real danger is the limitations you place on yourself.Find what you like doing and do it. Youll get better simply because youll have more experience and practice with it and youll enjoy it because its something you can gain actual achievements and accomplishments in. So if youre bad in math and youve failed that many times already take that as a sign that thats one mountain thats not worth climbing. But theres lots of other paths you can take.Youre so young. Youre going to find there are lots of things you cant do everybody does. Im not saying to give up every time there is an obstacle and i know you wont because you seem very determine to youve taken math that many times despite failing each time. So you have the drive and selfmotivation to succeed. Learn to channel that into things youre good at.If you absolutely need that math course for your program see if you can lighten your other class loads and focus more time to math.

You guys start seeing each other and eventually fall in love and get married.  Youre happier now than you ever were but you feel like nows the wrong time because youre too old to enjoy it for long.  You realize that a little happiness is better than none.  You sit by her bed and hold her hand as her face grows pale and the light slowly drains from her eyes.  I love you she says.  I love you too you say.  Flatline.  You cry.  At the funeral you cry again.  You think back to that time in high school.  That woman that rejected you.  Last week her name was in the paper.  She was arrested for domestic violence.  She got high and busted her fifth husbands skull wide open.  Youre glad she rejected you now.  Youve lived a full and happyinhindsight life.  You go to the senior center where you met your wife.  Its a park now.  You sit on a bench and watch people and animals run and play.  You smile and remember.  Smile.  Remember.  You doze off.  You feel kinda sick.  You go to the doctor.  Its back.  In your old age treatment wont do much good.  Youre ready.  You lived a full life happily.  You close your eyes with a smile on your face knowing you may not have made the best decisions in life but they were certainly pretty fun. That was a good life you lived.  You hope youll get to do it again someday.  Maybe that girl that rejected you will have a better life next time around.  ,self,cm8qthe,1,t5_2qh96

2406870,0,t3_2mysqq,So you wanted someone to read your rant and Im going to employ the classic are you me? gag. We share many similarities although our paths diverge on multiple instances for example I didnt have the girl of my dreams and my insecurity was to a lesser extent but still incredibly prevalent. The parts that didnt diverge for instance include the fact that you talk to friends positively regardless of how you feel which is like me. My father very recently passed away so Im dealing with that now not fun.So advice time. If you are me then it is in your best interests to see a doctor possibly a psychologist if you can. If you live in a place where free medical attention doesnt exist I am sure there will be some sort of counselling service that is free but remember counsellors arent anywhere near as qualified as a psychologist that being said it is really good to talk to someone whose job is to make you feel better. I am not in the girl scenario that you find yourself in however I would strongly advise against reengaging in a relationship if either a there will be a lack of feelings on your part or b it will create more emotional turmoil for yourself as eventually you are likely to start pretending you are slowly getting better to make her happy.Thirdly take the first piece of advice very seriously. See a doctor if you can if you cant use an online counselling service like beyond blue.Penultimately if you are anything like me the feelings of inferiority will likely not fade for a long time. Selection bias will play into this in that you will find flaws in yourself and overlook your strengths. Even though you are aware of your strengths you seem to lack belief in them which may be difficult to fix.Lastly spend time checking this subreddit rxeffect and think about making one to do with doing  minutes of homework each day and getting more sleep and exercise a little. If you have trouble sleeping I encourage looking up meditation techniques and sleep techniques. Something I found really difficult to do but once I had become used to was keeping your body position in your bed the same. Force yourself not to move around in bed and eventually sleep will come if you stay still. Scratching and shuffling wont affect it much but try to keep that to a minimum.And If you would like to talk sometime feel free to send me a pm or dont I wont be offended or worried either way. Maybe for both of us talking to someone in a similar situation with similar feelings would be beneficial? In the end most of my advice is see a doctor talk to a free online counsellor. Or you could talk to me but Im not qualified for any kind of talking.,self,cm97588,2,t5_2qh96

2471424,0,t3_2nv3hy,I think for some people suffering from similar issues theres often a common denominator to why you feel the way you do. Its easy to pinpoint if its a major event that happened early on your life but for others its bits and pieces that contribute to those negative feelings. Identifying the root of it all makes it easier to confront those emotions but not the events themselves since theyre in the past. What you learn is that you can allow yourself to put the past behind you.Sometimes you feel like a peice of shit because you do shitty things. So I think its real pointless to simply advise someone to love themselves. What should be said is give yourself a reason to love yourself. Tally up accomplishments big or small you get to build a sense of self that way. Not everything youll set your mind to can be accomplished which is a good way to keep you grounded where failure doesnt shake you. You know your own self worth and you begin to project that into external relationships. But Im not a therapist its just whats been working for me and its been doing me good.,self,cmh60vg,2,t5_2qh96

Anyone who believes it has a grossly distorted understanding of the real history. Antimiscegenation was legally eliminated nationwide in . What remains of cultural issues is irrelevant to that legal fact.The thing about these kinds of biases is that they have very long lives. There certainly are people in the U.S. right now who would support such laws and the most recent numbers I saw from the early s if I recall were shocking to me  around . Thats how durable bigotry can be. To be completely fair that was only half a century after Loving and many people alive then still were so the native bigotries that drove those laws were still alive in those who held them originally with no need yet to even pass them on.I have used these facts and numbers a few times in explaining how legal changes regarding gay rights are not going to eliminate antigay bigotry in our time or for several more generations. No one alive right now should expect to ever live to see a world or nation without antigay bigotry though it will continue to gradually ebb away over time.

If peoples attitudes toward someone can be subtly altered by choosing to describe them as one phrase rather than another then I feel I should give my patients the benefit of the doubt by calling them by the more positively regarded term.

2903158,0,t3_2tceh4,When I was  I wanted to grow out my bangs but this was a huge issue because mom couldnt stand voice dripping with disgust people with their hair hanging in their eyes.After many discussions finally got her to agree that she would tolerate it somehow for the fairly short amount of time it took for them to grow long enough to be hooked behind my ears.Some weeks in comes a night when she suddenly out of the blue loudly and disgustedly declares that she cant stand it anymore those bangs are getting cut!Chased me around the house with the scissors me begging her to remember her promise that it wont be forever its just a little longer please please please till she trapped in in the bathtub.Only to then throw down the scissors and with a glare of pure withering revulsion and loathing she stomped out of the bathroom.I sat on the couch sobbing while she sat at the dining room table reading the newspaper thinking that any she couldnt possibly be going to just sit there and read the news while her daughter sat withing sight and sobbed over her broken promise her breach of trust.That wasnt the first time she broke trust with me or my brother or my sister it wasnt the last.Even so it took me into my s to be able to take permanent hold of the idea that there was nothing I could do to fix it that she was what she was damaged somehow incapable of seeing things in any other way than that life has been so hard for me.We all need our parents in ways that run deep deep deep.  When we have a parent who cantwont see us for ourselves who sees us only as a disappointing uncooperative character in their own narrative it hurts we blame ourselves we get angry we act out hurt ourselves and more.Try to start thinking that youre on your own in this that since shes stuck as are you with who she is fixing coming to terms with her impact on you is in your hands.Get therapy remind yourself that its not because of you start telling yourself that just because she cant take care of you does not mean that youre not worth taking care of yourself.Dont be hard on yourself if you slip back into expecting hoping for something different from her  Like I said the need we have for parents that care runs deep.  Youll hope again and get hurt again probably more than once before you get a good strong grip on the idea.For what its worth my experience is that it doesnt stop being a sad thing but it does end up pretty far in the background.Also check out rraisedbynarcissists  seems possible to me that youll find others over there who have stories along the same lines...Youve got fight from what Ive seen over the years that fight is going to stand you in good stead I think youll do just fine in the long run!,self,cny3fl0,1,t5_2qh96

Went back home after  days.Readmitted  days later with my stomach distending another AB treatment by day  they operated me.Took out a foot of small intestine created stoma near the end of the large intestine. The last loop goes past my bladder and they have a connection due to a diverticulum or something.The tracheastomy has been there since shortly after birth. There were some complications with getting me out and my airpipe ended up being too narrow. They made a high stoma about an inch below my adams apple. They had a metal tube in there for the first three years during which I was unable to speak. Once they removed the pipe I pretty much behaved like any normal kid.I can swim if I go snorkling I keep my thumb on the hole to prevent me from sucking in air.

And its reflected on reddit.  Dont have a girlfriend?  You dont deserve a girlfriend.  Want a girlfriend?  Get a girlfriend.  If you HAD a girlfriend then you would DESERVE a girlfriend.  You DONT have a girlfriend so you dont DESERVE a girlfriend.  Want a job?  Get a job.  If you HAD a job then you would DESERVE a job.  Want a raise?  Get a raise.  Want a better job?  Get a better job.  Dont want to be depressed?  Dont be depressed.  The US likes to blame peoples problems on them.  Got mugged?  It was your fault.  Basement flooded?  Your fault.  Medical problems?  Your fault.  Car problems?  Your fault.  Computer problems?  Your fault.Alcoholics tend to end up in the ER.  The ER doctors of course will know youre an alcoholic but theyll only say that it could be the alcohol.  And they might refer you to a neurologist.  Your general practitioner will do the same.  Theyll tell you that it could be the alcohol...  What else could it be?  It could be the alcohol...So what could be the alcohol...  Bad tremors.  Every meal your hands will look like theres an earthquake.  A medium one.  Youll lose motor coordination.  Youll wake up several times during the night every night.  It will trash your liver.  And it will weaken your bones.  Youll probably get in car crashes.Now...  I cant talk about you...  but the alcoholics I know...  They arent alcoholics because people call them alcoholics.  They are alcoholics because they depend on alcohol.  They and probably you are dependent on alcohol.  Its their crutch.They use it to cope with life.It gets them through the day.Its the path of least resistance.Its what they know.Its how they cope with certain harsh realities of life.  With things they want to change but that they cant change or things that wont change in the near future.But its...  the best analogy I can give is that its like an abusive relationship.Youll tell someone in an abusive relationship that their partner is hurting them that there are better partners out there.  That they should leave their abusive partner.But the person in the abusive relationship...  theyre like an alcoholic.  That abusive partner is like a vodka bottle.

One shouldnt just check out because they dont get their way.Every time is too much for you. Period. Thats a bright line you need to draw since youre the one who has to deal with how these toys feel. Besides you dont need this to devolve into a fetish where you cant have sex without the stuff. Have a frank talk with him about what he likes about the toys and why they need to be part of the experience. I once had a girl who would have the most spectacular orgasms with toys and would require an hour of hard work to even get one without them. Shed love it but Id be wasted after all that work.

Period. Then go about your normal life. If she ignores or forgets a chore cheerily remind her. Then do whatever you need to in order to maintain your sanity making mental note when youve done her chores. Then at the end of the day make a real list of what you had to do for her that dayweekmonth or whatever.Also make the same list for when she does do her assigned chores whether you remind her or not. Do not nag bother or harass her. Either she does them or you do them and make note of it.At the end of X period if she is making progress sit down and tell her so talk about what you like that shes doing and what you dont. Buy her something nice or take her shopping and show her love for her hard work.If not arrange somehow that she be out of the house for a while or whenever she is that youre home pack her stuff and when she gets back tell her she needs to leave. This is the critical part you cant just kick her out in most states without notice and serving her an eviction notice. So check out your local laws on eviction and have one ready.Do not listen to objections or complaints do not answer questions be compassionate but direct she takes her stuff and goes off the property. If she refuses you have served her an eviction notice and thereby can call the cops to have her removed.Shell beg and plead and youll still kick her out. Then youll wait  days and if shes still begging to come back youll let her come back. And when she walks in youll be waiting at the door with her list of chores.,self,cpmagmi,10,t5_2qh96

3511253,0,t3_30gtm1,gt Knowing that  or even  years ago I would have comfortably been able to go to many of my target schools.What were some of those schools and whats your GPAScores? I find sometimes instead of thinking that you were treated unfairly it helps if someone simply levels with you. Its like the Im doing everything right! Why is it not working out for me? mentality. For me I really need someone to just slap me in the face and tell me that Im not doing everything right that in fact Im doing it all wrong. The top comment talks about famous people who didnt bother going to a great school but Im not sure thats so useful for you right now. Im sure youre not thinking about being the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs right now. Instead Ill share my story. I went to a top  school from . I hated it. It was miserable. I had no friends and it was basically the worst  years of my life. It really had nothing to do with the level of the school or how hard it was. I skipped  of my classes and kept to myself in my dorm. I played videogames most of the time and fell into an awkward sleep schedule  hrs of sleep  hrs of being awake. After  years there I have no friends from that  only a few casual acquaintances mandatory lab groups. I was not in a good mental place and was pretty depressed for most of it. It was a miracle that I walked away without having a completely screwed up GPA. I went to a state school near home for my masters. Honestly mostly because I didnt want to work a real job yet. I spent  summers doing internships at a large corporation which resulted in me hating the daily cubicle grind of the real world. I wanted to keep my casual school schedule and the ability to play videogames all the time. But hey things turned around. Friends from high school were still there and I got back on track socially. I ended up going to almost all of my classes barring sickness or emergencies. Those  years basically washed away all the ill effects of the previous . I now have a job that I like no cubicles and plenty of new friends that Ive made. My point is that these arbitrary metrics for how good a school is doesnt really matter in the grand scheme of things. There are people from all sorts of schools that turn out just fine my coworkers come from a variety of different schools  individuals can succeed even if a school isnt top. Whats more important is how you as an individual make the most of your current situation and how you use whats available to you to meet your goals. And none of that can happen if youre not in a good mental state which is step .  ,self,cpsi91h,3,t5_2qh96

She talked to me herself a lot about how we all die that it is nothing to fear and that she knew shed done a good job raising me and would be fine.  While her death when I was  she lasted a lot longer than projected was agonizing I take comfort in knowing that she was ready to go and had discussed it with me.  I am not religious but I find peace in knowing that she loved life she loved me with all her heart and it was okay for her to go.  Perhaps her parents would want to talk to her about it?

3819633,0,t3_3455mr,Try taking melatonin. Its a natural supplement nonhabit forming and it helps your body feel sleepy not drugged or groggy. Often we will feel tired but force ourselves to stay awake. When we do this we teach our body to stay awake when we are tired which makes it much more difficult to fall alseep when we are tired and actually want to go to bed. Melatonin will help reset this relationship between feeling sleepy and staying awake. Try it for at least  days every night at the same time. Take  tablet or pill and climb into bed. About  to  minutes after you take it you should start feeling sleepy. As soon as that happens just close your eyes. Dont try to sleepyou are only relaxing for a few minutes. After youve rested a bit you can go back to doing whatever you were doing before... Next thing you know it will be morning. Once youve reset your body clock you should start to naturally become sleepy at the same time as before. Go to bed as soon as you feel sleepydo not try and push through in order to finish somethinggo to sleep.Hope that helps. ,self,cqro3l7,8,t5_2qh96

4405280,0,t3_3bczq5,I am currently in a top ranked MBA program. My personal advice is the following assuming that you want to go to a top ranked schoolMajor in whatever you are most passionate about because you will likely do better in it. GPA matters so just try to do well in school. Most of the successful people that I have seen in business school in terms of recruiting and finding jobs were those that did not major in business or economics in undergrad. The reason why is because they have some OTHER background in addition to the MBA that makes them even more useful. For example if you want to end up working as a Product Manager in tech then it is best to have a major in comp sci work as a software engineer and then go for your MBA.  You will need work experience before you get your MBA. Think about what you want to do for work after college and then postMBA. What are your career goals? If you want to work in business right out of college an economics major might be useful. It wont really help you in terms of getting into an MBA program although it might help you when you are IN the program better understand courses. There are people in my program who majored in econ comp sci or psych. All  could easily get you to an MBA. It isnt so much what you major in that matters as the job that you have after college. A psych major or minor probably will help you the least with finding a great job but who knows. Bottom line Think about where you want to work postcollege and choose a major that will help you get there. Top ranked MBA programs like to see work experience at large successful companies. Definitely take a few econ or business classes. The BEST thing you can do is get as many internships as you can. What you major in doesnt even matter if you have great internships. And remember pursuing an MBA is all about a story line. Its often times for people who started off somewhere but want to transition into business ie. people unlike yourself who initially thought they wanted to be teachers or something else or those who want more senior positions and think an MBA is their ticket to become a manager. Youre way ahead of the game. Do what you are interested in thinking about your postcollege job and I wouldnt focus too much on an MBA. Its overrated anyway.,self,csm7k4w,1,t5_2qh96

4415264,0,t3_3bfutm,I used to live in downtown DC which has a massive homeless population and in some areas they are pretty aggressive.First... Totally unreasonable its fair to take the money back I think. For anyone who isnt used to encountering homeless people... Some tips? My personal opinions anyhow More than anything smile and say hello like you would with anyone on the street. Feeling invisible and subhuman to people is something a lot of homeless people talk about as being one of the hardest parts of homelessness and its so easy to change that. If you cant or dont want to say Im sorry I have nothing on me. Dont just ignore them because its honestly uncomfortable and sad and sometimes scary. In most cases my approach was if you ask me like Im a person and I have something to give I will give it to you like youre a person and not like youre a child I will then lecture. Its their choice what they will spend the money on. Yes it might be something bad and youll never know. If you need proof just dont give. Donate to a shelter instead.If the individual is mentally ill or an addict they may even ask for money for food or the train but then be unable to resist spending it elsewhere. Lecturing people and adding strings to a very small gift of money is insulting to people who really are in need of foodtoiletriestransportationa uniform for worketc and will never convince someone who wants to go buy meth to not buy meth. All it accomplishes is making a person feel less than.Now if you demand money because you just lost your license over a dui and smirk at my shopping back full of the indulgent rich ppl thing I bought a single oz diet coke when I refuse then NOPE. See ya!Same goes for if your opening line is that you want to go in the alley and knock me up. NOPE! Those I ignore because it scares me.TLDR Treat homeless people like they are people. If they are jackass people who demand more treat them like jackass people and nope out of there. Otherwise dont be a jackass either.,self,csnc28o,1,t5_2qh96

The experience youre getting on your mobile vs. your desktop is ideally the experience the developer intended and the fact that you might dislike the desktop version of these sites is sort of incidental and probably just comes down to poor CSSlazy wordpress templating. As a web developer surely you understand the frustration of trying to get your content to display a certain way regardless of which device the person is using and realizing how difficult that can be given the amount of devices that are out there. Responsive design essentially solves this issue. Looking at most responsive sites on a desktop or laptop theres no reason you should be able to tell its a responsive site unless you shrink the browser widthview it on mobile granted.But if youre referring exclusively to the startup templated single pagesingle scroll sites I dont disagree entirely with you though. Ive grumbled about how everyone is imitating the same style as well. Thats more of a problem with lazy startup sites and less of a problem with responsive design though. ,self,csv13dq,1,t5_2qh96

While I didnt receive the full story that managers got everything you outlined here was conveyed to employees during group huddles and meetings with our direct manager and will be further detailed in oneonones with the store manager to go over how individuals will be directly affected.I believe the Tier system means that tier  stores micro stores with lower volume will lose hours while larger tier stores will be gaining hours to better accommodate customers. Its all based on volume and sales to add balance to the stores from what I understand. My store falls right in the middle and sees virtually no change which is nice but smaller stores shouldnt be vastly affected really. So as far as I can tell PetSmart isnt gunning to strip people of hours or positions when theres no reason to make those changes. I feel the way theyre going about these changes is surprisingly positive for a retail store I worked for Best Buy during a few overhauls and that was AWFUL and I have high hopes for how things will go. ,self,ctduhlh,1,t5_2qh96

4760590,0,t3_3g3ulj,Ive been through a similar transformation. Something happened with my life that gave me a true wakeup call. After I realized what a selfish selfcentered person Id been I knew I needed to change. My selfishness hurt other people whether or not it was intentional the outcome was the same.Part of what helped me in letting go of the guilt I had over hurting others was to apologize for my previous actions. I either spoke facetoface or wrote letters to people explaining what happened that made me realize that what Id been doing was hurtful. I didnt try to excuse the behavior but I did sincerely apologize for it. It was scary to doI didnt know how people would react. Would they be angry? Would my efforts unleash their hatred or contempt for me? On the contrary Ive been met with incredible kindness. Thats where the true healing for me happened. Instead of thinking back on the shitty things Id done and feeling like a worthless person I can think of the forgiveness Ive received and know that I dont have to do those things or act that way anymore. And that has helped me in the process of forgiving myself. That does take time but it is happening.Not everyone is the forgiving sort and thats all right. I have done my part. I have done my best to make things right. Others have a choice to either accept my amends or to reject them. I hope the best for you on your path. Im glad you got well ,self,ctum85f,3,t5_2qh96

Depression is all about what you feel about what you have.Back to your stress levels though you should look into maybe checking out an audiobook on stress from your local library or acquiring it through other means Amazon are pretty big into making audiobooks available these days and then theres illicit means....Personally Id say the book I recommended would be pretty decent for helping with stress though I cant say that Ive ever seen it specifically linked to stress relief. Part VI of the book is called Coping with the stresses and strains of daily living though so one would assume theyre all part of the same ball of learning to be happy and feel good about your life which is the main aim of the book.The thing about dealing with depression and stress and anxiety though is that none of it is about strength or coping. None of the stuff described in the book requires you to put yourself under any more pressure than youre already under it just suggests outlooks that inherently place a less severe burden on you in the first place.,self,cu6jlcv,1,t5_2qh96

4909909,0,t1_cudeplt,My sister said the same thing about CCMU. She called the ombudsman but they told her they have to talk to my dad first because he has power of attorney. I thought it was like CPS where any call has to be investigated but apparently theres more that has to happen before they will do anything. Ill have to ask my sister about the APS thing. My sister and her husband went to the facility and the nurse said she didnt have the key to get into my grandmas room and that they would have to come back Monday. They asked about the fall and the nurse was very vague and said she wasnt there when it happened. As far as I know her money is in a trust. My dad went to an attorney and had it set up after my grandpa died a few years back. He took care of her for a couple years until her dementia got too bad to leave her alone so he gets a certain amount of whatever is left when she dies based on an agreed monthly allowance not sure what its called.

Every logo I found online looked kinda terrible when printed so I grabbed an image did a quick mask on GIMP and then cut it out so it had no background.  The wording under the logo wouldnt transfer well so I did a shitty MS WordArt job to write big blocky US AIR FORCE letters underneather of it.  I threw it up on imgur so I could have it stored somewhere and called it a day.A year later Im poking around again for the job when I see that the image made it around the internet and is now on the Wikipedia page for the Air Force Symbol  with my same shitty word art job underneath of it I can notice the big blotchy patches in the letters from the masking I did not bother to clean up,self,cue3wb4,10,t5_2qh96

He ended up having a stroke. Theres a lot more but suffice it to say he was suffering quite a bit. Im pretty against killing even for benevolent reasons. Its a failing of mine. In that instance seeing what he was going through I felt I had to give the go ahead for the euthanasia. Even though I know that it was ultimately the right choice that fact is almost purely academic for me. Ill always feel guilty about letting him get as bad as he did for my own selfish reasons. But I also feel that because I gave the word no matter how sick he was his blood is on my hands. Guess in the end our situations arent exactly similar.

5086624,0,t3_3knlgc,A Im posting here because the spirit moved me here. Im not really responding to any particular post or criticizing anyone. Im just playing devils advocate here.B I think theres got to be a happy medium. The folks who use  to justify letting NSA analysts turn on my phone and watch me without oversight creep me out. The folks who claim theres no real terrorism problem and its all a hoax and we dont need the TSA also creep me out. I work near the  site and can see first hand that the security people there are creeped out and were creeped out long before . They think theres stuff percolating. I myself can look at the crowds in the subway stations and see that of course there are people who would cause problems if they got a chance. Maybe even for extremely understandable reasons. But I want to respond by doing what I can to say bring peace and prosperity to Israel and Palestine or Syria or Iraq not by letting understably angry people blow me up. I truly think theres a possibility that the  percent antiTSA antisurveillance movement is being unwittingly nurtured by Putin or some other folks with motives that are not necessarily  percent in Americans interest. I think that nosurveillanceever folks may accidentally end up helping the totalitarianists by making people with concerns about civil liberties look naive at best and at worst like tools of genuine bad guys. I think the best approach is to concede the possibility that real threats may exist look to see what strategies really catch bad guys then figure out what oversight and management mechanisms can make the effective strategies less creepy. Example Require systems to log what analysts have looked at.  Block analysts access to systems that track their neighbors celebrities or people they actually know.  Use randomizing systems to reduce the odds that analysts are familiar with the people are looking at.  Once analysts are following people on an ongoing basis or if they need to watch people they know that should be subject to extra randomized oversight. Example if you watch your neighbors a randomly changing group of supervisors should be verifying that you need that level of access.  The rules for using this information should be very clear. You can use the info to catch terrorists kidnappers major human trafficking rings and drug rings that frequently kill and kidnap people not ordinary criminals.  There needs to be a big ongoing multipartisan effort to block and political blackmail. Example What if the whole Hillary email scandal is just the CIAs way of punishing Hillary for being soft on Snowden? I dont really care if the FBI occasionally skims my Reddit posts to see what Im saying about Israel. I do deeply hate the fact that I have to look at every action my leaders take and wonder if theyre being influenced by surveillancepowered blackmail. I think one problem with the nosurveillanceever approach is that it would probably fail to create a good program for stopping political blackmail when thats my primary concern.,self,cuz4qam,0,t5_2qh96

5125805,0,t1_cv3uemi,Its not that people in adult life will be as overtly aggressive or abusive its that in living through adversity you end up developing coping mechanisms that are useful later in life.  For example I find that Im fairly good at talking to people and steering conversations in socially advantageous ways.  This is directly a result of talking my way out of bad situations and trying to turn negative attention into positive attention.  Theres nothing that says life should be easy and I think experiencing some degree of pain early in life is a useful tool.  I dont think it does society much good to make sure every person lives their entire childhood in a pink cloud of acceptance and expression.  For a culture to work properly we all need our edges softened by the thrashing of the sea.I can appreciate the need to save young people from this emotional and physical abuse but I find that often the people who suffer as children grow into much more interesting ambitious or talented young adults.  Pain is an experience that I feel it unwise to delete from childhood.EDIT I have not seen that movie Ill have to give it a watch.,self,cv3uocz,1,t5_2qh96

5362409,0,t1_cvx3dhk,I know this is truth I have experienced many a situation where the spirits and th dimension act out in front of me. Mind of God Book of Nature. The universe provides granted you have love. I feel loveless at times. I would rather continue to live in my pointless state of complacency. If I stay in this country for much longer I could blow but I am a peaceful pacifist. The only negative externality of giving no fucks. Meh.   Professors are nothing more than good old boys that spread jobs based off a bull shit list of nudge nudges and you know what I means. That was uni I started to slack on all my papers. I realized that the profs didnt care anyways. They got paid the same no matter how they graded my papers. I came to conclude that most of them have children and need to spend tie with the bloodline rather than fret over my petty wordplay. I passed under the radar. The simple act of showing up to class every day was all I needed I did little to no work. Most of it was busy work anyways. At that point I had no fucking idea what to do. Happy go lucky alcoholic we had a shitty football at that time. Like the worst ever in the history of the program. Rock bottom. We drank a lot win or lose. Most of the people I met drank a lot too. We formed paper friendships but I kept up with maybe three people outta the whole experience. I walked away from a girl that wanted to fuck I would have but for some reason that afternoon in the park. I dont know why but for some reason right then and there my dick went on strike. I have not had good sex since. The past two years I have been faking it every time some less so than others but mostly meh. Even when I was on top of her the former NFL cheerleader but I then shut down and my heart said no. Like a higher form of me came down and turned off the blood flow. I then flipped her over and massaged her back for an hour. I wanted to love. Not fuck. We cuddled for hours afterward. She was confused but at the same time intrigued by my unpredictability. I later on noticed her manipulation skills and the fact that she could not control my indifference was bothersome. She wanted to continue fucking wet dream right but for some reason I flaked out. Meh. Id rather for some petty logic stay at home and hide from society. Thanks anxiety. Still its funny to run into her now with whatever her new boyfriend might be doing. Only the lonely. I have been a solo traveler backpacking central america each time I faked it when it happened. The only girl that I had an interest in mentally already had a bf. I think she still does but I know she would be ecstatic to see me again. I went down there to chase another girl that I ultimately never met up with. Haha such a flake I am. I go down there like a cat and check out where she accepted a english teaching job. I wanted to be alone and that is what I got. I traveled around with other backpackers for a while but nothing more than three days. We exchanged emails and all that jazz Ive only kept up with two of em. The rest I am too lazy to give a damn. I deleted my facebook when I left university three years and going at it. If there is any proof that I can give up alcohol for a while its that I can give up other things! Like beef pork amp chicken. I have been  meat free for the past three years! Occasionally I would try a meat item at a buffet but after a sniff or small taste I would lose interest. I cooked for myself throughout college whatever the reduced for quick sale meat was I would grab and cook it that night with some veggies. It was also my change in eating habits that helped me lose weight with little to no exercise. The simple act of eating whole foods and dropping GMOs also helped. But I have relapsed a bit but I have on occasion eaten a back of chips or whatever that was heavily processed. I know what my body wants but as a creature of habit I look to old school comfort foods. My mother was not a healthy cook she liked convenience. My grandmother was kinda the same and now I understand why they both passes. Mom died at age  leaving me to give company to my grandmother and I did so with both my uncles giving a blind eye to her. I did not have the most social time during my last two years of high school. It was hard to relate plus I lived in the middle of nowhere. You had to make an effort to drive to school or even just to get to the nearest convenience store. Going to a small college town liberated me from that the act of living downtown made me feel cosmopolitan. I still am like that today. I could do larger cities but why? I been from Boston to Atlanta DC to San Fran Denver Seattle down to Panama City Tegucigalpa San Pedro Sula what ever is inbetween. You see people in their everyday status. Every day my small little retirement kingdom takes a blind eye. Ignorance is bliss only terrorists leave the states in their eyes...common folk leave California and thats far enough. Portland New York to Anaheim and small places in between the past three years. I have a hammock and will craigslist rides and hitchhike. I have been enriched by many a driver. Money is a curse. My most enriched moments were at the spur of it. I should be enriched by now but I still hold to my pessimistic habits and remain Cynical to the status of this country. This system cannot last for long fiat currencies and global agendas. Follow the money but do your own research. Sigh. The self in me says I need to go do something else. Thanks for listening and this was better than me creating my own self post. Youve been a great host. I declare a toast. Live brother. Learn to be with yourself. I think that is what I meant to say in the first place. I lived alone after college for five months in an expats house as a sitter in Central America. Call me a Tico a hammock and a book is really all you need in life. The cat would jump on my keyboard and demand attention. There were nights there where I would cry myself to sleep. Other days I pulled out bits of my hair in stress and anxiety. Other days I would strut about naked and watch the howler monkeys fornicate in the trees. I became one with myself. Other days I would spend the entire day surfing r the internet was strong enough for that but I could not netlix. I would stream live sports and movies from other sites though. I had a hard time learning Spanish but I know its because I am introverted and dont like small talk even if it would actually learn the language. Meh I know the universe doesnt mind when we look at the bigger picture. I rant but the point is......follow your bliss and dont look back. I even though I am at what feels like a bottom point I will regroup and get back to my mojo. I may start giving a fuck again and start socializing again. I will text her the first one I mentioned in a few days to see if she will play serendipity with me for the weekend. Half of me though would rather not just be at home and meditate. I am indifferent and will enjoy myself regardless. It is not that I am lonely I feel genuinely connected to her more as a long lost friend. But I am greedy with my time and being in my own presence brings me closer to Jah. I digress....peace and love.   Bless. ,self,cvx3x1k,1,t5_2qh96

I was not greeted with the same intention. I was greeted with this is us this is what we do what our family has done and gone through and what we expect you to know and do as well without any regard to who I am or my family or what they do. There are cultural and racial differences between us but I have never been made to feel a difference until I met this family. After my husband and I were married my MIL asked me what I was. My response was capricorn because Ive never been asked about anything else. She giggled and said something to the effect of my race. So I told her my mut list. Apparently thats the main question her family was asking about me. Im white. MIL is native american. My FIL was black. She cant remember where Im from. She might remember my brothers name or my moms name but she didnt choose to learn them until a year or more into our engagement and I called her out on it. Because I knew everyones birthdays and anniversaries but she didnt know my mothers name. I was practically required to learn everything I could about his family. When my mom and brother came out in August and everyone met for the first time my MIL asked them if they were from Chicago. My mom and brother both looked at me and I got pissed. They looked back at her and explained where we are from in southern Illinois. I had told her this information many times beforehand.

Whether you see yourself as male or female is based on genes environmenti.e your societycultureupbringingexperiences and selfperception. You think youre a man because you were born with male sex organs and your culture placed man values on you and you have propogated those values yourself. Imagine someone with your exact  DNA could have been born in India and wound up in any number of genderroles. Second your sex is determined by sexchromosomes. XX for female XY for male. There are people born with a number of different combinations due to natural mutations at conception. Such as XXY XXYY XYY XXXY. Additionally people can be born with XX and XY throughout different areas of their bodies called mosaicism. look up Klinefelters Intersex  and Gonadotropin.

It sounds like its time that you all have a very honest discussion about quality of life. I truly hope that your dads condition improves drastically but if it doesnt you all and especially he himself need to decide how much pain is too much. There are drugs that can control practically any level of pain but those drugs to put it bluntly shorten life. For example many cancer patients die of longterm overexposure to morphine rather than the cancer itself. Had they not taken morphine they may have lived longer... but at what cost? On the other hand taking very serious pain medication is in no way a death sentence sometimes a balance can be found. It depends on the severity of his pain and his sensitivity to painkillers. A hospice nurse could explain this better than I can but this is pretty much what palliative care means. Care that is more focused on comfort and quality of life than healing.A hospice worker can also advise you as to longterm accommodations for your dad should he be unable to come home. Im pretty sure theyd even be able to suggest some support groups for your family. And a hospice worker is trained to ask all the tough questions so that you wont have to be the one to do it.

Because we cant know what is in somebody elses head until we ask them and cannot make a truly rational decision regarding that other person without knowing. We only assume the rest of the details like him forcingtricking her into this or implied manipulation for her not to go.For all we know she could bring it up to him and express her feelings we dont know that she has and he could be like Yeah youre totally right.

Like the doctors do you sit at  meter from the screen cover an eye and try to see the letters.I built it  weeks ago back then I could see th font or so by my left eye dont remember for the right eye  or . Now that  weeks have passed I can see th font with my left eye. Thing is before these  weeks I used to have a routine of spending at least  hours a day outside purposefuly looking at distant objects as I walk. Thats when I felt my eyesight being a bit better. Afterwards I went back to my old habits of living online. And in  weeks I have this. So my guess is that outdoors is what helps me. At least I hope so.

5848251,0,t3_3vbzh3,There is basically no evidence that they had a key. It is scary easy to bypass a lock. The police suspect someone had the key. But in reality a bump key or a normal lock pick could easily look like nothing had happened to the lock. From what I see the police are being lazy and jumping to conclusions in order to not investigate because it was low priority and extremely difficult and time consuming to find the real criminals. Or they are attempting to see how you react to the question itself maybe giving them some starting point if you were to second guess about someone with a key. However it may look like the person knew exactly where the valuables were meaning the criminal had probably been in the house before. This leads to suspects being friends and family. But thats not too much evidence either because most people keep valuables in their bedroom and jewelry in a specific box made for it and is easily identifiable. Does that sound like you?There is no way to say that this was done by someone with a key definitively unless they find the criminal and he has a key. For that matter if youre not sure what day it happened the door may have not been locked at all people forget sometimes even forgetting to close the garage door could do it. ,self,cxm8fqi,6,t5_2qh96

They take time to learn. If you missed the opportunity during your teens like I did then you will still need to build them up. Improve your confidence and do things that make you uncomfortable.How old are you Im guessing ? What are common social interactions for you? Do you work or are you at schoolcollegeuni? What makes you think you are awkward or misunderstanding social cues? Feel free to PM if you dont want to share publicly. ,self,cym21ex,2,t5_2qh96

Said I had a  chance of going to jail for some reason. But anyways. The power was out but everything was still working. The Tampa bay buccaneers were beating the Denver broncos  last time I checked. But I went to go get Chinese food downstairs and the whole place was flooded with fuckin sweet and sour sauce and I was trudging through that shit with sandals on.

FirstgtA strip search at the border is not a routine search and mustbe supported by reasonable suspicion and must be done in aprivate area. While the latter criteria was certainly fulfilled in OPs case its not clear that the former was although CBP can always throw up its hands and say there was a reasonable suspicion without having to clarify further. Clearly OP believes that there was no reasonable suspicion and I agree with him on that point. It would be worthwhile then to file a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties From the ACLUgtThe office investigates abuses of civil rights civil liberties and profiling on the basis of race ethnicity or religion by employees and officials of the DHS.

Any bus available or a driving age adult who can understand or assist? If not youre online.

Anything where you physically have to talk to someone with your voice will help the most  phone or Skype type things.  Real human voice and connections like that make the most difference to people like us. Try rdepression and see if there is anything in the side bar that might be useful for counseling and if not try there as well.  You need help you know you need it youre willing to do it.

If you walk in tomorrow and you talk to your boss and ask to have a honest conversation you have a real chance to influence not only your position in this company but your bosses impression of you moving forward. First look at this as an opportunity to lean. Start the conversation off by saying something like Id like to talk about yesterday. I should have spoken up when you asked me to do it but public speaking is not something I am comfortable with. I didnt want to let you or the company down so I tried as best as I could and thought I would be able to overcome the issues I have had with it in the past but I froze when I got up there. I wanted to address this directly and talk about solutions moving forward. You need to start and control this conversation make it about you wanting whats best for the company make it about you SOLVING a problem. Continue with. As much as I appreciate the opportunity to give a presentation I dont feel confidant enough with my public speaking to fill that role yet. I would prefer to stay behind the scenes working in talk specifics such and such a capacity. However if public speaking is something you need me to do for the company I will need help in the way of formal training.  You need to go in ready to show how you can better serve the company in a background role. Make it known that you heavily prefer that but you are flexible if that is what they need from you so you dont seem too demanding and unreasonable. No reason for you to jump ship OP. Just control the conversation and own up to your mistakes dont be afraid to ask for help and be the solution to the problem instead of not addressing it at all. ,self,d00iquv,2,t5_2qh96

Your immediate thought is that something is mentally wrong with youpreventing you from doing something. This is called negative self talk and can be extremely misleading. I struggled for years with a similar issue.  I learned to start actively using different language in order to readjust my feelings about what I wanted. Instead of using the word need I switched to want. I started therapy. Learned a bunch about REBT and CBT. After hours and hours of assessments found nothing physiologically wrong with my brain.

Its totally normal to be completely terrified of having kids  ESPECIALLY if its a huge unknown for you.Best advice would be to start lurking on baby child and parentingrelated subreddits I like rBabyBumps rbeyondthebump and rParenting off the top of my head and seeing if you can get involved with your friends and their kids  maybe not babysitting with no other adults at this point but spending more time with them together discussing how parenthood has been so far for your friends and how its changed their lives both the good and the bad spending some time with them and the kids so you can see what an average day is like for a parent and learn what to expect ifampwhen you yourself have children. Just remember to always offer help and try not to be too much of a burden while youre over offer to fetch things clean or do laundry for parents of newborns dont sit and expect to be entertained and wear clothes that you dont mind getting messy  familiarity with various different children definitely helps with the uncertainty I think.

Okay taken and moved on. I went for world cricket semifinals where my country was playing. Had amazing fun and then my team lost. Felt dejected. Got home and an hour later had replies from  of my top colleges which were honestly a bit dicey but not totally ungettable. Rejected from the toughest one and wait listed on two of my favorites. So yes this day has been rough and Ive never seen as much failure in a day as I did today. I can empathize with you. Hope everything works out for both of us ,self,d1llt7a,1,t5_2qh96

He would wake up and immediately write down his dreams in an attempt to get to that point.  That was in college and we havent kept in touch so I dont know if he was ever successful in being able to control his dreams.  It would be pretty cool to be able to do so though.   I was able to do that once that I recall back in  obviously Im old and thats a dream that I remember to this day.  Obviously I spent the entire dream flying because being able to fly would be awesome.

8095458,0,t3_4q0qu0,In high school I had some really bad anxiety and depression. I had friends and a decent home life but still it persisted. One day I started working out because I had always been self conscious of how little muscle I had on my body. After about three months of lifting in my basement using a few dumbells bench press and a preacher bar I developed a decent amount of muscle mass. Getting the occasion glances from pretty girls and compliments my self confidence grew leaps and bounds. Which helped me be more social and thus opened me up to more experiences. Maybe you can give that a try. Its Important to try and figure out what you think is causing these feelings and correcting them. Therapy never worked for me but I think thats because I knew what I didnt like about myself or my situation. But its different for everyone. ,self,d4q03ih,1,t5_2qh96
8096590,0,t3_4ppa16,First of all the working world is a battle ground and all is fair in love and war. When it comes to a job that takes  minutes to show you how to do it and there are no shortages of new applicants you do not need to tell them anything about your future. Never show them your cards. Besides what if something changed? What if you could not make it to school? Then what? Cover your ass first. If you have to work you work. That is priority number one. Now..if its a job with a lot of training and investment in you via the company then its not cool to ditch them after  weeks. You need a learn a few things about the working world and how to cover your butt. You can be honest to some extent but sometimes you have to deal with the reality that being honest can work against you and doesnt really matter in the grand scheme of things. Choose your words wisely. ,self,d4q4o8j,1,t5_2qh96

My medicine helps tremendously.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel.  Depression is an illness not a definition of who you are.  Treatment of an illness can be long term medication or shorter term therapy.  But like most illnesses it does require treatment.  You cannot beat or cure yourself on your own just like you could not treat cancer.And unfortunately it is longterm illness.  I view it on the same level that I view my diabetes  years on that one  Juvenile not adult onset.  Treat it and life is better.  Ignore it and you will never feel well.I know how to deal with my depression better now through treatment.  Most of my days have happiness and light.  I still have some days that getting out bed is a struggle but this is not EVERY day.  Keep seeking treatment until you find something that works.  Dont give up!

Other than that I often find them attractive on attractive women. Wearing a hijab would neither qualify nor disqualify you for friendship.

I know its hard to do so but try to think ahead and vote according to your perception of what you want for the future of your country.

The reason Id get one is because this might be a once in a lifetime experience it is so out of the ordinary just being outside and being able to go up to a bunch of strangers cause youre playing the same game. Or even just seeing people go outside in groups to hunt at AM. Especially cause its such a hype now it is a very special moment it is still new and fresh and everybody loves sharing their experience with the game. People will teach you stuff and you can trade tips. Thats why I experience the game in a much different way. To me it is not about winning or getting a high level as fast as possible. I mainly enjoy just being out having fun and trying the catch rare Pokemon.And even when I dont find that rare Pokemon I see on my radar I dont really mind cause I know Ill catch it eventually and it gives me something to look forward to. ,self,d5g564f,2,t5_2qh96

For example if you only have a few ingredients in your fridge to make a meal the old you would think lets make a sandwich with that sausage. Where as the new you might think lets make a garlic bechamel sauce to go with this sausage and pasta.Some recipes can be a bit difficult when it calls for special timing of everything mixing at the exact moment etc. I tried making a carbonara the other day and it tasted like complete shit.,self,d5xs0jq,2,t5_2qh96

Thats the best advice I can give you. One day I hope my ex does what yours did. It was the exact same situation except for medical school and she thinks it was that she didnt love me. It wasnt that it was that  years worth of distance changed her into believing that I wasnt even there anymore. If your TRUE love had the right mind to come back then let her know that right now you still need to focus on yourself but that if she wants to be apart of the support system that you so rightfully deserved then thats all you can offer.

8802622,0,t3_50pfrl,Hey! I use to self harm even when I was in a relationship for  months and then a bit later when in a  year relationship. For being with someone who has never dealt with you being their problem and you care about them then Im going to give you advice that I learned from having people who didnt know how to handle it.. Ask about their past. Not just what caused the problems but what happened before the issues and after. Learn who they are through what is still fresh in their mind.. Learn their habits. If self harm is after drug use or alcoholism then you need to find a way to maneuver them THROUGH the issues. Distractions keep us stuck in our problems and issues instead of working on ourselves at the core. Even being a workaholic allows for a alternate reality to avoid living  hours a day to having to live with who we really are. . Hold them. Dont say a fucking thing. Once they are ready to talk stop them and just live in that moment. A single touch to someone physical body can change their life and carry on an energy that can move through from the path that they set for themselves.. Whenif they relapse dont be the person they cant tell. Whether it be from disappointment or disapproval or whatever the case may be. She has to be willing to trust that you wont just be there once and get tired of her. And you have to be willing to trust yourself that youll be there for her more than once. The girls I were with literally made me feel like my feelings and emotions were a burden and made me a burden over Time. The worst thing to feel in a relationshipfriendship is to feel like youre the only one that cares. And that goes both ways. . Dont let her run over your feelings in the previews of you helping her. Dont be the person she blames in the future for her habits. Dont let yourself get torn down by her failures. My worst issue is that I would try to blame the other person even when they werent the core of my issues. I made more issues to reject fixing myself and most people who need help do this. . Empathy is key. We are all human. We are all the same. We may go through different things but weve all felt the same way regardless of our scenarios. Happy thoughts for your future and Im proud of you for reaching out to someone for help. ,self,d75yeq3,1,t5_2qh96

But judging by the rest of this thread it just seems like an overall confidence thing. If I could offer any advice itd be this you only need two things  good hygiene and friendliness. And with that youll make friends and from there a girlfriend. Try being a good listener. Everybody really just wants someone to listen to them. And if you need confidence you can be confident in the fact that youre pursuing an engineering degree. That takes hard work and you should feel good about it. ,self,d767iic,2,t5_2qh96

I had to get an occupational license that let me drive only during work hours along with an incar breathalyzer. The court dates ate into my vacation days and the fines attorney fees and court fees bled out my savings. Along with all the safe driving classes I had to do which werent cheap. Thats just temporary. The long term is my insurance will be jacked up for the next  years and if asked I have to disclose that Ive been arrested. And my state is one if the two in the nation that wont expunge DUIs at all. So Ill carry this forever. Thankfully most jobs only care about felonies and mine was a misdemeanor. It was a hard and expensive lesson to learn but the only way it could be taught to me was with legal action. It sucked donkey balls but I am so thankful that they caught me. It truly was a blessing in disguise. The first DUI is a strong warning. These second third etc is just you fucking up. I intend to never reach fuckup status.

8934460,0,t3_52lxos,As someone who has raised  kids and gone from dirt poor and relying on WIC Women Infants and Children to support us in buying formula etc. to making over k a year as a family and paying it all back in taxes my advice is that it isnt a money thing as much as it is a mental health thing for you.Are you ready for a kid to be  in your life?  Above your husband or wife or significant other?  Night after night of lack of sleep followed by work.  Fun always involves the kiddos and you find all new ways of enjoying life as a family for free if the money isnt there.  It is all carried by the strength of your own emotional will power.  You have to be ready for it or at least have confidence in your ability to carry through.Where you live matters a lot though you have a few years.  If you live in a bad school district you need to pay for private school or just move and lower your style of living to give your kids a better public school.  I recommend the latter if possible.  Dont send your kids to a crappy public school if you have it in your ability to avoid it you will regret it.  I say this as a teacher.  If you have no choice get involved with the teachers each year.I dont think you need to swamp your kid in extra curriculars.  Involve your kid in one thing he or she likes try things out.  Dont kill his or her independence.,self,d7lsg67,2,t5_2qh96

I experienced a very real world example last night which was amazing.  Someone close to me had a gay wedding and got a comedy drag act  to perform at the reception.  It was kept as a surprise so nobody was expecting it.  The looks on my older relatives faces were priceless.  They were already a little uncomfortable being at a gay wedding to begin with and then this pair of largerthanlife characters comes out and begins their riotous act.  I could feel everyone over sixty shrinking into their chairs.  These were people who wouldnt know where to even see a drag show let alone be caught dead at one.    But very soon they were laughing just as hard as anyone and by the end everyone was doing the cancan to I Wanna Dance With Somebody by Whitney Houston.  Afterward I saw a couple of my uncles chatting with one of the performers out by the kegs.  Within the span of thirty minutes the concept of drag queen was transformed from an alien fringe culture element that they could stereotype however they wanted to just another thing people do to express themselves and a wonderful thing at that.

It would be nice to be able to go to a reliable and more discrete category for when you are specifically in the mood for that genre and dont want to sift through a bunch of tangentially related stuff.There was a period when the first Batman blockbuster came out with Keaton when comic book movies would pretty much just be thought of as Action movies and around the time when the LOTR movies were coming out fantasy was pretty much synonymous with sword and sorcery type of hard fantasy in those times scifi was mostly left to scifi. But since then the comic book movies rose up as the new geek cool before becoming just completely pop and so they have managed in a sense to get the credibility required for people generally to think of them more particularly and in a way gets them cast as also part of this niche genre or the other rather than just wholesale relegated to the broad genre of action.

I know that she doesnt want to be living with her parents anymore and at the very least wants to find a job as soon as possible. So maybe her feelings started shifting when she imagined her life with a job. I dont think she ever liked the idea of me pursuing graduate school but Im now realizing independent of her that I dont like it either. She knew I was planning on withdrawing soon to find a job near where I live and I was hoping she could find a job in the area as well. This really came out of nowhere for me. She says she started feeling distant a month ago. Theres a part of me that thinks this is unfair and too sudden since we were away from each other for most that month. It just doesnt make sense to me. Why couldnt we talk about her feelings and make a decision together? She promises there isnt another guy and I fully trust that.

Whats really admirable about him is how hes found a way to be utterly changeable in a way that keeps both sides committed to advancing his interests.The right will be convinced that whatever hes saying at the moment is PC crushing no nonsense hard truth because of the hysterical reaction he gets out of the left and the left will be convinced that whatever hes doing at the moment is pure evil which keeps them from having any coherent strategy to fight him since theyre constantly reacting to Trump Its really a huge strength in politics that almost no other politician has. It may even allow him to do things no politician has managed to do before since the dawn of the information age. Hes managed to polarize the media narrative in such a way that he never really has to worry about being called out for inconsistency.His left wing opponents will never say hang on maybe he isnt the devil if hes said all this reasonable stuff and his right wing supporters will never crucify him for betrayal or flip flopping because hes managed to detach his support almost entirely from specific policies and shifted it onto a general feeling he puts out with help of the liberal medias reaction to him.,self,da7ne6k,2140,t5_2qh96

Clearly youve never spent time outside of Reddit or even been here long.This post is most ironic considering Redditors were quite adamant that after the election TD and its supporters would be gone and everything could continue as before but your candidate lost the Donald won and the meltdown is still in full swing. No one advocates for death threats or doxxing. Its within the nature of the internet considering its userbase. Obviously its not cool or acceptable but it is not specific to one side or one issue people have been doing it both positively and negatively. Youre a mod in a position of power. You also dont seem to realize the type of people youre dealing with I would encourage you to spend some time lurking pol or ch.net and observe these people who strive on provocation. Ultimately you dont understand the internet dynamic at play here between Reddit and the Donald and TD and chanch.

If friend A and friend B  assuming the cause for their drastically different weightlifestyle ratios werent genetic  rigidly followed the exact same weightloss program they would also burn precisely the same amount of body fat. Right?The only difference would be that friend A feels its a piece of cake to go through the program while friend B feels its pure torture. Right? gt In very very few cases would reducing calorie intake and increasing physical activity have no results.Or even less results  right? And those cases would precisely be the rare genetic ones.

10314824,0,t3_5nmhzg,I hear what you are saying however I will say I dont think they are worsening. Black people have been getting killed by people in power unjustly since black people were first brought to America. As time went on more and more people have realized how wrong this is and it becomes more and more publicized but still in the midth century it just wasnt being reported because still so few people in the regions it happened would believe that it was unjust or just wouldnt care. This continued in the s and s but now weve hit a technology shifting point where even though these killings have gone down individuals can show them happening to the whole world. That wasnt the case in . People didnt carry around video cameras everywhere. Even if they got a video of something where do you put it? YouTube? Barely existed. Governmentpolice? They were the only ones to see it. Thered be no rallies against it or anything. But with phones with cameras becoming normal we got so many videos being released to the public that it surprised us. We started hearing about Stories we wouldve otherwise not have heard of like killings that were not filmed by individuals like the guy who was dead after being put in the truck and driven rough forgot his name. So maybe that doesnt sound great but just realize that at least on the front of Black men getting killed by police it may be bad but it is certainly getting better. ,self,dcd8pjg,2,t5_2qh96

The other  are fucked regardless.The west can afford to take in far more than  of the Syrian refugees. The average cost of resettling a refugee in the US is about . Note that this is the high estimate I found with other estimates as low as .That sounds like a lot. But there are far far more people in the west than there are Syrian refugees needing to be resettled. On average it would cost each person in the west counting the US Canada and Europe about  for us to resettle every single Syrian refugee in the world. That means taking about  more in taxes per month for one year to save millions of people from living in horrendous conditions. For . of the average Americans annual income we could take in literally all of the refugees.Meanwhile the US is spending  million per day fighting ISIS. A total of . billion dollars since .

It had gotten so bad the other kids would run to the teacher saying Hunter is doing it again.  The girl was scared of the kid and would have her brothers walk her to and from class and would try to stay away from him at recess etc.The teacher had tried to stop the behavior many times she had contacted the parents to help stop the behavior and the kid wouldnt stop so they eventually suspended the kid when he kept doing it.They then placed on his record for teachers in the future to look out for this kind of behavior.  If he is doing it still at  and  etc this could be a real problem....It took me a two days of looking around to find that information most of which came from an interview of the girls mother as the school wasnt allowed to comment.However CNN etc just attacked the school and talked about the outrage...how dare they suspend this cute kid who just kissed a girl on the hand....They didnt bother to find out what really happened or they omitted any facts they didnt agree withOur media has gotten worse and worse and when it comes to politics....holy fuck they lie their asses off.....mind you not flat out lies but lies of omission and exagerations...Its fake fucking news...and I dont support Trump.Im actually PISSED OFF at Trump for not organizing his attacks on the media.....a handful of fucking interns could compile huge lists of lies of omission by the media...The media in this country is shit......Put it this way....Fox news....no different than CNN and the NY times only difference is what narrative they are pushing,self,ddtp582,8,t5_2qh96

10892179,0,t3_5vm4p8,When I was younger I often had the same feelings. One thing that I noticed though was that some days were ok my life seemed okay and good opportunities seemed possible and I could look back on lots of good memories. Other times it seemed to be all shit looking back at my life it seemed to be always shit and looking forward I could imagine nothing but shit. So there was a conundrum two different ways of thinking sufficiently compartmentalized that I could not really see one perspective while I was immersed in the other. It occurred to me that my impulses while in the negative perspective could destroy the opportunities I might have in the positive perspective. I could not stop my feelings but I decided to form a strong internal rule do not act while negative. It was effective enough while I slowly worked things out.Another thing that I thought was that as long as you are alive there is every opportunity available. When you are dead there are zero. Why not change your name move to another city take up a completely different life? I know people who pump gas for a living have good friends and interesting roommates and are happy in their lives. Why make yourself miserable because some stratospherically difficult career didnt pan out or because a couple of people in a world of billions dont appreciate you? The corner in which you are painted is arbitrary. Why not change everything? And another thing I realized after many years is that the desire to end it all is just how we interpret our feelings into words when what we really want is to change it all to transform ourselves or how we stand in the world. Looking back on the two different ways of thinking which one is real isnt so important as which one offers you any opportunity at all.,self,de3g8xd,1,t5_2qh96

11094548,0,t1_deosbzb,gt The main thing about the ACA that sticks in my craw is the individual mandate. I cannot fathom how a country that prides itself on the liberty of its people can enact a law forcing those people to purchase the goods and services of private forprofit businesses.You really wont like taxes when you learn what they are. Taxes involve the government taking your money and spending it on all sorts of goods and services from private forprofit businesses. I agree that governments should generally own the services themselves though. Its a very silly right wing idea to take your money and put into private companies rather than creating government owned organisations that do the same work for cheaper.I dont agree that you have a right to not contribute towards healthcare costs in your country though. Libertarian ideas like that are wonderful if you happen to be healthy but people shouldnt be punished for developing diseases that are expensive to treat.,self,depk2ja,0,t5_2qh96

Theres no legal prohibition against being  feet tall and having kidneys made of cheese but you cant actually exist in that state because of physical and biological constraints. Its not illegal to factor a prime number into smaller integer factors but you cant do it because of mathematical laws. Similarly its not illegal to optout of participating in American society in any way but you cant do it because economic factors spread the effects of that society so broadly that its just not possible.,self,depofzi,1,t5_2qh96

Its really very inconsiderate even though I know youre not trying to be. This kind of comparison is for when someone complains that its raining today and you say at least its warm enough to rain unlike last week! and is really not appropriate for serious topics because it invalidates the persons problem. I dont fault you at all for this a ton of people fall back to it could be worse especially when theyve had a similar but perceivably worse experience. I used to do it all the time until someone explained to me that it wasnt very helpful. So I just wanted to point it out to you too its a valuable thing to keep in mind. Grief counselors often teach this as well  especially in the case of miscarriages and still births the number of people that respond with well you can always try again or at least you got to spend a day with him instead of offering condolences is staggering.

Long distant relationships are incredibly difficult but successful ones already have strong communication skills since thats all you have.

When he comes back express its time to talk.  Explain why your feelings are hurt. Explain that if you guys want to last and eventually close the gap of your long distance you have to work on communication skills.

11645798,0,t1_dgg0b6y,Yeah its not impossible. Its a choice. A choice that comes with consequences if she takes it but also many upsides. To lay some outPros of leaving Complete and utter freedom to do what you want. This is more than just the hijab issue. You get freedom in soooo many ways. I mean heck I have a very good family and Im yet very glad I moved out as soon as I could. It gave me a ton of freedom that I love very much. Freedom in everything from what to wear to who to date to what you do with all your time to what you eat... and more. Independence is good for you as a person. It matures you and leaves you better prepared for many kinds of challenges. Consider all the things that your parents might do for you. Leaving them means you have to do those things yourself. And while thats more work it grows you up considerably. Theres a reason why many people are cautious about dating someone who lives with their parents. Its associated with immaturity. Safety is a big thing. Really restrictive parents can be a safety risk. How might they react to you disagreeing? What about when you dont want to let them win? What about when you disobey them if youd do such a thing? Distance gives you safety by not exposing you to those things.Cons Youll possibly have to cut contact completely. This depends entirely on whether or not theyre willing to let go at all. Or in other words if theres safety concerns with leaving. And you have to be careful here. If theyre completely unwilling to let you leave then them knowing where you are is dangerous for you. So you have to consider having little or not contact with them. This also means you might have to lose contact with more favourable family members too if they cant be trusted not to turn you over. This is also somewhat difficult as a student. Naturally that means youd lose anything that they provide for you. Eg if they paid for college or allowances or the like. Even if you dont have money theres options eg a shelter. But its admittedly harder if thats the case. The economics of this is really the biggest thing here. Especially since youre living at home which means youd have to go from probably having everything paid for to having to cover everything yourself. On which note if your parents act very poorly eg harassing or violent things can get messy. Not fun to have to get restraining orders against people. There may be social consequences from those that would side with your parents. Eg friends might hate you. Of course on the flip side some might side with you.Of course Australia is not the middle east. But safety risks can still be a thing that you have to consider carefully. Mostly though its gonna come down to freedom vs economic issues. In the utterly best case scenario however your family could choose to give you your freedom and not cut off any resources. But thats not something that can be counted on. All the cons are really just possibilities and I cannot comment on likelihood. Youd have a better idea than me on those.,self,dgg2cmx,11,t5_2qh96
11648502,0,t1_dgfzd1d,Yeah well the number one road block is the hordes of people who would immediately reject someone for being struggling. Having a hard time? Git gud. You sound like a complainer.
