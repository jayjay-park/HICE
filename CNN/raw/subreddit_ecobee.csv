6127092,0,t1_cyltesl,Your sleep schedule isnt the same as the away  youre trying to use the wrong inputsconditions to adjust the temperature.To override sleep you need to adjust the temperature.This is the same reason that your use of the home setting overnight doesnt make sense... When youre asleep the unit doesnt view there being no motion as being away logically it also wouldnt register motion when you wake up as you suddenly being home,ecobee,cym34qo,1,t5_37pn8

7965764,0,t1_d478o9e,Some people might run it though. Personally if ecobee had that and I was building new then I would probably run Ethernet to it. But I am over kill like that lol,ecobee,d4bfecq,2,t5_37pn8
8020107,0,t3_4p28bn,Have you checked the wires on the baseplate?  Maybe one is loose. Did you check the breakers?  Maybe on got tripped.,ecobee,d4hja1i,2,t5_37pn8

8098702,0,t1_d4qalmr,I have tested it and made the changes on thermostat app and web portal at different times and it doesnt matter.  The app still doesnt update on any of them.  Ive reregistered the thermostat a couple of times now and it seems to work for a day or  on the app but then goes back to not working.,ecobee,d4qd802,1,t5_37pn8
8477071,0,t1_d615y7s,Hmm since I dont care about logging I wonder if v plugin humidistats exist.  They do!  Provide power when humidity is above X kill the power when humidify below X.  Or to avoid cheap Chinese stuff that isnt UL approved wire an outlet to something like this,ecobee,d616chm,1,t5_37pn8
9170678,0,t1_d8eehe2,update when you get it working or well not working.  like to keep track of solved cases.,ecobee,d8eg9pg,1,t5_37pn8
9311146,0,t3_57ydvg,This is correct! Youll be able to monitor both the sensors and the average. And you can schedule the wireless sensors to be the primary sensors for different times of the day. For example during the day I have my ecobee reading from all my sensors but at night the ecobee is only reading from my bedroom sensor to make sure Im comfortable. I dont care what the rest of the house is as long as I get a good night sleep!,ecobee,d8w98eo,2,t5_37pn8
9511954,0,t3_5b3lzl,Make sure that the wire you think your C wire currently colored green is actually connected to the C terminal at the furnaceair handler unit.,ecobee,d9ljtst,2,t5_37pn8
9538688,0,t1_d9ly5b3,You dont have much commands to use. I got my Home today. With voice commands you can make it so it creates a hold or a hold until your next transition. Then you select the temperature from a drop down list in the IFTTT settings. You cant just say Hey Google turn up the heat to . So I have it set to Hey Google turn up the heat and itll set it to . I was also hoping to be able to turn on and off the Heat or AC by voice. But you cant. I guess well have to wait for native support.,ecobee,d9oubh3,1,t5_37pn8
9586439,0,t3_5c9aoi,Ive found my ecobee to not work at all with homekit since iOS  and to have extremely limited capability with Alexa. ,ecobee,d9uq34z,1,t5_37pn8
9722494,0,t1_dabhxts,Im honestly not sure how theyre doing it. All I really know is that its one unit with two different thermostats. As far as I know the only  control over the system is through the thermostats and theyre just your average Honeywell programmable thermostats. Something like this,ecobee,dabicr9,1,t5_37pn8

10016225,0,t3_5isnf7,The air coming out of the registers is less than body temp so it may feel cooler even if it is  degrees. Can you take a photo of the wiring of the terminals at your air handler. Where the thermostat wires end up?,ecobee,dbd55hc,1,t5_37pn8
10179804,0,t1_dbwrwxt,Before you spend money on vent cleaning run the fan alone and see if the Ecobee restarts. If it doesnt severely clogged vents highly unlikely are not the problem. Check the V AC transformer.,ecobee,dbxxqoj,1,t5_37pn8
10200383,0,t1_dc07ywr,So I switched sensors with another room and now that one is going offline as well. Its like ft away and through a hallway. Any idea why it would start dropping it? Could that mean the thermostat is going bad?,ecobee,dc09qu4,2,t5_37pn8
10241423,0,t1_dc4tk7e,We stupidly tried to setup the PK coming from the wall instead of right at the furnace panel.Tip Watch instructional videos before you start |,ecobee,dc4x7sz,2,t5_37pn8
10260620,0,t1_dc72z4a,So no PEK and a single C wire up the thermostat?So the wires going to the thermostat would be R W Y and C?,ecobee,dc73idd,1,t5_37pn8
10416158,0,t3_5p5cqv,Im not a fan of auto mode for the very reasons you described. If I wanted it  degrees in my house auto mode would have it anywhere from  to  or what have you. Instead I just use heat mode in the Winter and cool mode in the Summer. For Fall and Spring I just play it by ear. ,ecobee,dcoqmu2,2,t5_37pn8

10729625,0,t3_5t43c5,Was able to hook up rather easily. Boiler had two wires ac had  and an unused. Connected the unused one to the c terminal on the air handler and everything seems to be working. Only problem now is the two wires are in different cavities in the wall. A project for next weekend.,ecobee,ddmoil8,1,t5_37pn8

10940989,0,t3_5w4ixo,The device is not hooked up to HomeKit. That is the whole point here. When I go into the reset menu I get reset registration reset schedule and preferences and reset all. I have reset all at least  times in  hrs. ,ecobee,de8hi79,1,t5_37pn8

11421629,0,t1_dfk7ccm,I contacted support and it was the worst experience with customer service Ive ever had. I had to keep calling back everyday because they kept telling me to wait and or were saying it was my fault. They were so stingy about giving me a replacement. After the th call and when I sent screenshots of the data which they had access to from the beginning they admitted it was a software issue. At that point I just wanted a refund but I still have to pay for return shipping. Thats what I get from buying directly from Ecobee instead of Amazon. I went ahead and got a Nest and a replacement Ecobee from Amazon. Ill give Nest a try for a few days to see how it functions compared to Ecobee. ,ecobee,dfqmozt,1,t5_37pn8

11707314,0,t1_dgn1svj,Ill check it again.  I just switched it off.  Fan seems to be off now.  Would the  minute interval of running still apply with the HVAC set off?,ecobee,dgn1yej,1,t5_37pn8
