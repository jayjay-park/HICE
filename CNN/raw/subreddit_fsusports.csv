These motherfuckers dont know how to play football trying your best and being proud to injure players and end careers isnt how the game is played.

3265072,0,t3_2v09wq,I was born in Boca and moved to Minnesota at a young age wanting to maintain my Floridian roots. Never liked Miami still dont and watching Bobby on TV in interviews was like seeing that Southern grandfather I didnt have. Throw in the early days of the internet when listening to college football radio streams didnt cost an arm and a leg and Gene made every play sound like a horse race and I was sold.As fate would have it my cousins that remained down there became FU fans The two oldest attended and named their poor dog Tebow and the two younger ones have also adopted the Gators as well. Best part though was when I interned at Disney and one of my supervisors was a student manager for the football team in college. He told me all sorts of stories of his time on the team and tried to coordinate our lunches on game days to watch games.  ,fsusports,cp0g184,2,t5_2xys7

11234473,0,t1_df5co1h,I think the problem is that hes been here  years. At some point you need to just move on. I dont know if theres even anyone else out there nor am I calling for him to be fired though. The new contract is a little surprising. Really wish we couldve gone deeper. We lose so much talent after this season   Edit. I really do like Coach Ham. I think hes a real players coach one that players love to play for. Hes a fantastic recruiter maybe too good we cant get guys like Isaac and Beasley to stick around. I dont blame this loss on him. Our guys just missed so many shots and it happens. I mean they also get so many unlucky misses like the ball going in and popping back out. It was a fun season and I look forward to next year my last one ,fsusports,df5eui7,3,t5_2xys7
