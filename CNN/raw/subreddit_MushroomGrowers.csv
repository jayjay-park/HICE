4135732,0,t3_37un9s,Im going to give this a quick over as there would be some physic lessons needed here to accurately cover this. Im going to skip them lessons and get to the points that matter.Dry heat I am assuming you are talking about using an oven to sterilize can be done if you use fractional sterilization. Dry heat sterilization will take much longer than a steam bath in that steam has far more heat stored in it than dry heat dry air.Since the sub you are sterilizing contains water you can not get it above F at sea level one atmosphere of pressure until allmost of the water has be evaporated or you increase the surrounding pressure use a PC. Some organisms will survive at F. If you are higher in altitude water boils at less than F.I dont know how hot a jar can handle but I have had them to F. The jars handle it just fine the metal lidring will loose the coating from them burns off. If you have a sub containing water then you can not exceed the boiling point of water FC without increasing the pressure in the jar. Increase the pressure in the jar by very much and the jar will explode unless you increase the pressure surrounding it in a PC.A PC works because it raises the pressure outside the jar and then as the jar heats up the pressure equalizes inside the jar.,MushroomGrowers,crroyi8,5,t5_37713

4627251,0,t3_3be25w,I have a question. Maybe I just missed some steps or information but in the steps labeled Preparing the agar you prepare the agar in a jar with one Self Sealing Injection Port and one Syringe Vent Filter. In the next step labeled Injecting the agar you have all the agar in a jar with two SSIP and no SVF. I.e. not the same jarlid. How did that happen? Did you change lid somewhere? Or did you draw up all the agar from the first and inject into the second jar without the vent using a syringe? If I just keep the agar in the original jar with one SSIP and one SVF will it go bad due to gas exchange?,MushroomGrowers,ctdu4py,1,t5_37713

5056806,0,t1_cuvfilu,Fruiting is always a gamble.It is actually quite rare that you get a clone isolate that just will not fruit but it does happen.It is not unlikely to get an isolate that produces very few fruits very small fruits or even all mutants. The opposite is also the case many large fruits.The idea is to come up with an isolate that delivers the traits that you desire usually fast growing large fruits and lots of them high yield. The only way to determine this is to test the isolate. Make a master culture and preserve it for future use.This master culture should perform the same grow after grow.,MushroomGrowers,cuvjb5x,3,t5_37713

5498681,0,t3_3qemdy,Well first Id nix the coffee I see it added in a lot of advanced recipes for stuff but Ive mostly just heard it is a big contam vector so Id stay away from it at least to start. I mean weve all seen nasty moldy coffee grounds at least.I only simmer for ten minutes after a  hour soak or so no more than hrs. If you have a lot of burst grains they wont be as contaminant resistant even after full colonization.How are you looking for moisture in your jars? Too wet not letting the grains dry enough after simmer seems to invite tons of contams.Also what are you using for a filter in your jars? This is one other thing that could lead to  failure.Now all of that aside most important is your sterilization. . hours at psi is recommended.  You could go longer if you address the other stuff and still have problems. But Id be sure to check your system here  what kind of PC are you using does it have a gauge or a weight? I would suspect the product or your process here. Maybe the seal isnt great? How does it behave? Does it reach pressure in a reasonable amount of time and can you keep it gently rocking? Have you ever run out of water while PCing? If you did maybe even your first time using it it can ruin the seal unless its metal on metal but most modern ones have a gasket which will melt if run dry.,MushroomGrowers,cweibht,4,t5_37713

10414625,0,t1_dcojxng,Awesome thanks! I ordered this greenhouse from Amazon but ended up getting this one in the mail! Im not complaining! But I think the dimensions are too long for a dog crate bottom. Ill use your timer settings and see if the plastic does the trick. Thanks again for your help!,MushroomGrowers,dcokdi7,1,t5_37713
10509043,0,t3_5qgjt8,Hello everyone love the community. Im a new mushroom grower.  Recently I half assed read about Damions  Tek.  Instead of  coir and verm I did an actual  mix of coirverm and nothing else for nutrients in the substrate.  I think its also a little too moist.  Its been  days since I spawned into the sub and its only about  colonized. Did I screw up and should I be worried? The mycelium looks very thin and weird. For spawn I used  brf grow bags from outgrow.com which I was surprisingly happy with and a spore syringe from lilshopofspores.comI have one more question.  I made up  half pint lcs with  brewers sugar and while I was spawning I took a small piece of fully colonized brf and dunked it in h and placed one in each of the  jars. There are a couple lcs that look like they are growing great. What are the chances one of these lcs are clean after coming from brf?  ,MushroomGrowers,dczb7wx,1,t5_37713
10545092,0,t3_5qzphp,If it was a basement I would say u dont need floor drains but still good to have them but since ur on second floor I would be nervous of leaking getting into ur homes wood work.carrying substrate up and down stairs might not be fun.  and remember u will have to do it twiceonce to put it up there to fruit and one when its spent and u need to remove it.  there is a video series called lets grow mushrooms by Marc Keith that is a great beginner tutorial for most things u want to do and most of the techniques can scale up pretty easily.mushroom farming I dont think will make u much money its more a labor of love.  u can get by by the hair on ur chin some months no doubt but it aint like ur gonna be driving a Benz and sending ur kids to Cornell Pto diversify more than just growing mushrooms always seems like a good idea until u realize that the diversification projects take u away from growing and then ur back at square .  im not saying it cant be done it just needs to be planned correctly,MushroomGrowers,dd3ejpk,6,t5_37713

But If you want to also get into more advanced cultivation of activesgourmet you are going to have to learn some basic pcing grain preparation and also maybe some lcisolatingagar... Pick your favourite! I had the fortune to learn about fungi long before I even got into my first biochemistry lab as a freshman and i can tell you that the techniques described by some of the most talented people on the internet are amazing.
