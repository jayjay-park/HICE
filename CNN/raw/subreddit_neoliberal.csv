11490992,0,t1_dfyg5j8,It depends on what you want.CKII is more a dynasty basedquasi RPG with RTS elements. Its more about managing your dynasty and feudal relations than anything else. Its also probably the hardest Paradox game to really pick up and the amount of stuff thrown at you from the very moment when you jump into the game is really daunting and this is from someone who played Hearts of Iron  and enjoyed it OOB and divisioncommander appointment micromanaging hells and all. Its fun although its not my particular cup of tea.EUIV is a more classical real time grand strategy game. You control a nation and shape the development of the nation. Nothing super unique about it at the conceptual level but the mechanics and the methods by which it achieves its goals are superb. Imho its the best and best executed of the Paradox games. Its also arguably the most accessible except for maybe Stellaris.Hearts of Iron is about WWII. Thats about it. Its about WII and the first few years leading up to it during which you prepare for war. So its kind of railroaded by nature but its still pretty fun and you can pull off some pretty amazing things. That being said I think its also an interesting case where the older option holds up pretty well and I would consider HoI III and HoI IV as comparable products each worth purchase depending on your inclination.HoI IV is really good and boasts an amazing production system and is in many ways improved from HoI III but it has some serious problems especially with regards to the AI which some times does really dumb shit up to and including randomly completely abandoning fronts with rival nations they are likely to go to war with and air warfare far too many air zones are way too big meaning that in many areas planes will always operate well below full capability because they dont have the range to cover the air base they are sitting on  this is especially problematic for light fighters and CAS.HoI III on the other hand is a micromanagers wet dream. Also the OOB was fun to play with in its own way. It felt more like a WWII simulation on the operational and strategic combat side than HoI IV although HoI IV is better in most ways. Also for all of its faults the HoI IV AI is generally better than HoI III which will tend to do some really really stupid things  its just that when the HoI IV AI fails it fails much more drastically than the HoI III AI.Stellaris is...eh imho its the worst of the mainlin Pdox games. Its main problem is thats its pretty shallow. Like really really shallow. It has a lot of potential but it needs a lot of work to put into it to help make it more interesting. Tbh I havent played it much  I got bored with it and it unlike most other Pdox games a lot of the time it feels like the game is dragging. I havent played it in many months though so maybe its changed since then but my initial impressions after the first  hours werent great.And then we have Vicky... Vicky is in many ways the crown jewel of Pdox gaming despite all its flaws. Its almost entirely about economics and building up your nation and its economy. Unlike in most strategy games you dont make your country a super power by conquering huge swaths of land although you can do quite a lot of conquering if you wish regardless just...lets just say that wont work for most countries but by carefully managing its development and economy to make it into a modern industrial state capable of waging industrial warfare. Also the political system is great although it is held back by EUstyle stuff and mechanics. But despite this its still pretty good just dont expect EUIV levels of international diplomacy. The warfare for the first  years of the game is really good although by the time you get to the WWI era its...eh. Its not that its bad per say its just that it doesnt really do a good job of simulating WWI era warfare...at all. Vicky most certainly isnt a boring game in fact its one of the most fun games Pdox has.That being said...Vicky can be pretty difficult to get into. In no small part because of the amount of economic simulation it does. This is imho one of the strongest points of Vicky. But Vicky has plenty of problems given its age and its being a preCK game. However for the most part it over comes them pretty well.My personal rankings are EUIV Vicky II HoI   HoI  CK Stellaris,neoliberal,dfyi3sk,3,t5_2sfn3

Still I acknowledge that what happened with the coffee market certainly couldve caused a short term shock to the economy and such trade liberalization shouldve been handled more carefully.But lets look more broadly at this group of countries and on the concept of trade openness.Brueckner and Lederman in  find that when correcting for negative causality from economic growth on trade openness that the effect of trade openness on economic growth is positive in both the short and long term.Rodrik in  found that the trade liberalization of the s specifically were able to bring some countries out of economic decline but their overall effect was erratic because the policy and politics of these countries in general was erratic. Unpredictability in this sphere isnt good so that makes sense.As a counterpoint Gries and Kraft in  do not find such a positive effect of trade openness and financial reforms on growth but they certainly didnt find a negative effect either. They didnt correct for negative causality as Brueckner and Lederman did but I still want to include them because they say something I would very much agree with even more than trade openness and market liberalization fundamental changes like political stability and better institutions are vital in securing future economic growth. But neoliberals would certainly advocate for such fundamental reforms as well.,neoliberal,dgnuv3u,2,t5_2sfn3

11753808,0,t1_dgsbfq5,gtThe winner of the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science Mr. Sen has changed the way economists think about such issues as collective decisionmaking welfare economics and measuring poverty. He has pioneered the use of economic tools to highlight gender inequality and he helped the United Nations devise its Human Development Index  today the most widely used measure of how well nations meet basic social needs.gtMore than anything though Mr. Sen is known for his work on famine. Just as Adam Smith is associated with the phrase invisible hand and Joseph Schumpeter with creative destruction Mr. Sen is famous for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies. No famine has ever taken place in the history of the world in a functioning democracy he wrote in Democracy as Freedom Anchor . This he explained is because democratic governments have to win elections and face public criticism and have strong incentive to undertake measures to avert famines and other catastrophes. This proposition advanced in a host of books and articles has shaped the thinking of a generation of policy makers scholars and relief workers who deal with famine.The article goes over the relevant asterisks.,neoliberal,dgsbnsk,11,t5_2sfn3

In practice arguing about deontological vs. utilitarian ethics really doesnt inform policy all that much even if it makes for fun discussions.

That would have easily been used against him by Republicans as a socialist government run healthcare system that will raise everyones taxes and use tax payer money to pay for abortions which would immediately kill support for it from over half the country and the prolife crowd. The GOP would have cited the fact that Bernies home state of Vermont tried Single Payer and it failed because it cost too much so how is it going to work for the entire country? Even liberal economists were hugely skeptical of whether we could afford his plan not too mention Single Payer might sound great in a stump speech or some meaningless poll with no details of the plan but when it was actually on the ballot in Colorado in the last election it got rejected by  of the voters.Bernie would have lost the popular vote and every swing state in the country.

11807253,0,t1_dgy8eqk,Under Bernies proposal it would have been higher than what people are paying for their current plans unfortunately.  Theres this mythology that employers will pay their employees the difference they save but this is a fallacy.  If that was the case they would do that with employees who opt out of their company plans.  They dont because the insurance option is just a part of a packet they use to compete with other companies to be able to draw in people to work for them.  The people that would have been hardest hit would have been the poor who dont pay federal taxes now. If they dont end up having to pay which I wouldnt have a problem with personally their portion would fall on everyone else causing an even higher tax.  Many people the working poor and lower middle class could not afford it. Our country is much larger and has many many more people in it than many of the other countries with a single payer system.  It would be an even larger overhaul we as a country wouldnt see the true benefits of for at least a decade.  Look at the ACA we still havent felt the full benefits of it after just  years.  What we have seen has been good overall if congress and some of the insurance companies would quit working to make it fail wed see it more.  It could be another  years before the premiums begin to finally stay constant but it is set up to happen that way.  Congress should be going after companies trying to bail out on the exchanges fining them etc. for trying to make the system fail.  ,neoliberal,dgye5nr,4,t5_2sfn3
