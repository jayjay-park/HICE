149672,0,t3_1vs76v,Lifelong and former college swimmer here! Its really good that youre taking a class because swimming is aaaaall about technique and the best way to get better is with coaching and some personal direction. In addition to that I have heard have never looked myself that there are good videos on YouTube for swimming drills and tips for improving your form. I will also mention some fixes to a few things that I often see new swimmers doing During freestyle make sure you are looking at the BOTTOM of the pool  not the end not the pool deck not at your neighbor  bottom of the pool. It will help keep the rest of your body in line. Lifting your head and craning your neck will cause your hips to sink and slow you down.  Try not to hold your breath the whole time your face is in the water  blow your air out before you come up for another breath.  Speaking of breathing all you need to do to grab a breath is turn your head to the side  put your chin into your shoulder and try to look up at the ceiling. I often see new swimmers lifting their entire heads out of the water to breath. This again will cause your hips to sink. Be prepared to feel REALLY hungry after swimming... Im not sure what the deal is but swimming regardless of how difficult the workout was always makes me ravenous.Let me know if you have any other questions! I love talking about swimming ,xxfitness,cevh8i1,5,t5_2ryzy

You cant outtrain a bad diet so  hours isnt doing anything but making you tired.. You need to ease into it to avoid injury. . Hes so dumb!!! dumb dumb dumb.

Also I know my yoga wasnt the best but the channel is also about the fact that I am going through these challenges with people so Im not going to be perfect at everything but maybe I need to better show this.

258704,0,t1_cf73edt,The general rule is that as you decrease reps you can increase weight. Right now you could prpbably do x at about kg. I would try that if you want to shift more weight since  reps is more helpful more building strength than . Fat loss is more about diet than exercose but shifting more weight can help build muscle and make your body require more kcals through the day so it cant hurt but the difference between  reps and  reps is negligible when it comes to fat loss. ,xxfitness,cf7kmk0,1,t5_2ryzy

268344,0,t3_1x5p8i,A good friend of mine did something like this. I suggest reading the FAQs here and for rloseit like its been said by other comments. I would also take a look at this Its an  week clean eating guide that you can adjust to your needs. So over different weeks you have different small goals and removing certain foods from your diet. You can probably remove the week of no processed foods if wanted and feel free to repeat weeks as needed. As for working out Id keep it simple for now. One so you wont be as overwhelmed. Two its easier to take it one day at a time. Runners World has a guide to start walking if that is something that interests you. You can also talk to a personal trainer at a gym to give you a how to session on using different equipment. Also check out different coupon and deal websites to see if anyone is having a deal on a set of fitness classes or personal training session if thats something youre comfortable with. My roommate is overweight and wants to get back in shape so we found a set of bootcamp classes to do together to motivate her.

Fried smelt bones and all raw yellowtail steamed cod tuna steak...Ill probably never eat anything with a shell though.My advice? Start with white fish way less fishy tasting maybe a bite of someone elses here and there. Just one bite. Whats the worst that can happen if youre not allergic?

On a related note my grip was holding back my deadlift progress for ages I was going to try switching my grip up but I ended up getting chalk. It worked wonders! I could suddenly hold the bar firmly for the whole set. Its not what you asked but using chalk might help with your issue. Edit since you asked about grip tips in general how are you grabbing the bar before you begin your deadlifts?  Before I would plant the bar in the middle of my palm and wrap my fingers around it however doing this would mean my very soft palms would get smooshed by the bar as gravity pulled it down.  Make sure you start the bar off at the very base of the fingers not in your palm   that way the bar cant slide lower in your hand so it cant painfully compress the flesh either. ,xxfitness,cfwr509,4,t5_2ryzy

I stopped showering or going to the gym and basically lived off of gummy bears and tortilla chips. Stopped sleeping and eventually stopped leaving the house. I was a huge mess and couldnt even make it to my therapist or to the pharmacy to fill my anti depressantsanti anxiety meds and just totally gave up.And then in February or  I randomly started eating better I dont even remember why.  It wasnt a goal or anything. I guess I just got sick of tortilla chips and running three times a week which helped me sleep better which made me want to work out harder which made me want to eat better and became this cycle that totally lifted me out of my mental fog.

622154,0,t3_219koz,Heres some example math to illustrate the principle...Say you needed to eat  kcalday just to go about your daily life without gaining or losing weight. If you wanted to reduce that by ... so say to  a day you would have the following optionsA Eat  fewer calories every day.B Burn  calories more every week without changing your diet. This would mean either exercising for  minutes every single day or  hours of moderate to intense exercise every other day. Without eating anything additional.You can go either way. Neither option is inherently more effective but option A is much much easier for most people to implement. Many people just dont have the time inclination or fitness to exercise at the volume they would really need to to create the deficit theyre looking for. And many others find that increasing their activity levels by this much all at once creates an increase in appetite that makes it very difficult to stick to the exact diet they were on before they started exercising that many hours per week.Ideally you would find a balance that works for you and do both. But the above is the reason for the common wisdom that weight loss is mostly about diet. Its not technically true its just that tackling the diet is going to be easier more immediate and more exact for people who are just starting out.,xxfitness,cgazmpv,3,t5_2ryzy

My wife and I have been on a weight loss journey for the past year or so in which she lost like  pounds and I lost . Since then I have started weight lifting and she started running. The reason she started going with me is because she said that she wanted to start strength training. She asked me to create her a workout routine for her to do and she wanted me to come to the gym and show her how to do everything since she wasnt sure what she was doing.But were going to give this another shot and see how it goes.

694496,0,t3_223z33,If you are sore all over I highly suggest taking your bike to your local bike shop and getting it fitted to you  some slight adjustments to saddle height placement tilt handlebars etc. might do you some good. Of primary importance for maintaining energy on a bike is saddle height  if not at the optimum height you will spend tons of extra energy moving your legs. Also you didnt mention whether your arms hurt. You should have some weight on your arms so if your handle bars are too far away like if your bike stem is too long or they are not at the right height you may be putting too much weight on your butt and legs which could cause extra soreness. Also is your bike off the rack or builtrebuilt and bought used? If its been rebuilt with a different crank theres a chance that your crank arms could be too long or short for your legs which could put extra strain on your calves and knees. If your bike has all the original components and is newer than about  years old this shouldnt be an issue parts and components would all have been scaled properly to fit the correctsized rider. If your butt is sore it could be from your saddle or bad form or both. Google can give you some articlesvideos on form that might help. What kind of saddle do you have? Placement forwardbackward and tilt can also cause discomfort if your sit bones are not resting on the correct area which is where a bike fitting comes in handy. When you say your butt hurts do you mean your sit bones or soft tissue including lady parts or both? If your soft tissue hurts you may need to tilt the saddle down in front a couple of degrees or get a harder saddle. If your soft tissue is the problem and you have a soft saddle AND you think you want to get a harder saddle to take the pressure off I would suggest doing so immediately as it will take a couple weeks to get used to. If your sit bones are the parts hurting also consider getting padded cycling shorts. You can get a decent pair at any sports store for  and a nice pair for . You would not believe how much these help especially on a stiff saddle. On long rides youll also want to make sure youre getting enough energy either from energy shots or bananas or whatever is your preferred snack. That should help relieve some cramping in the legs. Finally are you riding hills? If so practice shifting as you go up and down. You probably do this already but remember to be conscious about it so you can make the most get the most momentum from your downhills to make it up the next hill. You should be a high hard gear on downhills then shift into a low easy gear on uphills. Practice makes perfect! I hope this helps  let me know if any of this doesnt make sense or needs more explanation! TLDR Make sure your saddle is high enough. Take your bike to a bike shop and get it fitted to you. ,xxfitness,cgj7sjs,4,t5_2ryzy

698410,0,t3_225l7g,So I am also  and ! And I thought Id share my experience though Im not super knowledgeable I also started at  though per MFP and I recently upped it to  about  weeks ago. According to Scooby for me it said around  so if I go a little over  I dont sweat it I just aim for at least that though sometimes dont quite hit it and I think thats ok too. Since upping my calories though I have a lot more energy. Ive had a bad couple days non stop driving blegh! so Im a little bloated but I have started seeing my stomach shrink! Not quickly obviously but noticeable to me. Especially noticed my night stomach is a lot closer to looking like my morning stomach  which is awesome. And I may be imagining it but I think my love handles may be shrinking. So overall I typically have a hard time hitting my  mark eating healthy since Ive never eaten a ton but making that has given me more energy during the day in general but especially when working out I sleep better at night and I think it really is helping with my overall goal of building muscle while also shrinking my stomach which is where most my fat shows. I also have been watching my macros and trying not to eat as much carbs I still eat too much. Bread is my love and I think that had helped too. I was scared of upping my calories too though but Im really glad I did! So for what its worth someone with your exact basic measurements has found it to be helpful  ,xxfitness,cgjnu0c,9,t5_2ryzy

709249,0,t3_22a2os,I have all kinds of things to say about PTs most of them unprintable.  Here are a few things to keep in mind though Make sure that THEY do what YOU WANT.  Its your money. Set some goals before you meet with them.  As others in the thread have said they should be specific measurable and realistic. Make sure that they do what YOU want to do.  Thats important enough to repeat.  Many not all trainers just have a routine they put everyone through.  You are paying for a workout to be tailored to your needs goals and capabilities.  Dont be afraid to make sure you get that. If they have you do any kind of exercise while standing on any one of these fire them.BTW I dont mean to slag all personal trainers.  There are some truly gifted and wonderful PTs out there.EDIT  There was a lot of interest in why I dislike unstable surface training so here are two articles about why its not productive.  The short answer is that our bodies automatically limit the amount of force we can exert when they sense we are on an unstable surface.  Since training the nervous system to exert maximum force is as important to strength training as muscular hypertrophy anything that automatically limits the amount of force we can generate is bad for strength training.  Furthermore people seem to forget that walkingrunningdancingfightingetc on only two legs is actually a pretty badass feat in the animal world and that our body arrangement is already inherently unstable therefore any kind of freeweight strength training involving standing on our feet is by definition instability training.,xxfitness,cgkw815,5,t5_2ryzy

With that said I do some additional stuff after I finish SL. The first  versions had a couple of accessory lifts pullupschinups pushups dips reverse crunches and planks. ICFx is basically SL with accessory exercises as well. I usually do some core stuff and work on pullups at the very least.

Set up in your most comfortable squat stance remembering to focus on your heels. Then imagine turning the screws by pointing your feet outwards to your sides without actually moving your feet. It sounds really stupid but I feel a huge difference in glute activation when I think about this and it keeps me from tipping forward.

I always went with him he spotted me corrected my form set up machines for me he knew everyone there and just made everything easy. We had a pretty messy break up and I nervously started going alone. One day I had a guy ask to use a bench next to me and I agreed but I tried to move away giving him space hit my bar on a machine next to me making a loud clanging noise more than once got totally embarrassed finished my set and left.  I was already really stressed about the breakup and I had a crazy panic attack. I didnt go back to the gym for a while. It was particularly difficult because I knew my ex had a membership along with his family and friends and wed spent a lot of time together there not to mention it literally triggered a panic attack in me. Im normally a very outgoing and social person but the idea of the gym was terrifying for a while.Im still struggling with that depression but I got myself going back to the gym by focusing on cardio.

For weights you want to wear Converse or other completely flat and non cushioned shoes because they are the most stable and you dont have to balance out the cushioning that other athletic shoes have when transferring the power to lifting the weight. When you go up in weight youll def find it much easier to see what muscles are activated. And it actually is pretty easyish you can lift a lot more than you think you can right now Im just going up slow in weight because im concerned about form too.

1046206,0,t3_262jvp,I did that  full program.   From my personal standpoint   I couldnt stand the  scheduling of it.    But well get back to that.   I saw no strength gains and very little in the say of definition  BUT  I am very muscular and had a decent layer of fat on.    I loved it for the variety and I ended up teaching myself  plenty about  different lifts.  I didnt like it because for as tedious as it was  I wasnt seeing results  I wanted.    I simply could not lift heavy in a good majority of the movements and it is evident the weight loss comes from cardio..   SO.. After wasting  a few months  I finally conceded to my husband and  let him work up a program for me.    different lifts    increasing  rep sets  and decreasing MR. At first I was pissed because it took for EVAR.  .. but down  pounds in  months and  I am seeing my old high school body.. without ridiculous amounts of cardio?  yes.   All of the yes.  TLDR   I didnt follow the schedule to a tee.  I had to adjust it.  and wasted  months on my own pride.

1046779,0,t1_chn9kpz,Welcome to rxxfitness! A lot of your questions are answered by our FAQ and I HIGHLY recommend you read the whole thing as its got a TON of information. But Ill answer some of them here for you in efforts to get you started.Before we get started start thinking about your diet less like a system you use to lose weight and stop once youve hit your goal and more like a lifestyle change that youre bringing into your life. Youre choosing to eat betterreduce sodadrink water for the long haul not a short term fix. Thats often what causes people to rebound and gain weight back.When trying to lose weight people try to spot reduce or say they want to lose weight off their stomacharmsbuttnecketc. Unfortunately weight loss isnt like that. You CAN however control your weight loss pretty easily. Its a matter of consuming less calories than you burn all day doing your daily activities. Other diets Atkins Weight Watchers Nutrisystem lowfat etc. do this by mandating protocols like eliminating certain foods and create a calorie deficit that way. The last lbs can be the hardest to lose in part because you have to restrict more than you expect to get the results you want. Dont get frustrated if you dont lose a lb perfectly a week  as women we tend to lose weight in bursts and gain water weight around our periods.To manage your own diet we like to recommend the MyFitnessPal MFP appwebsite for tracking calories. The only way to know what youre eating precisely is to record it so we recommend recording your meals for a few days to see what your calorie intake is. You may be surprised at the calorie levels of some of your favorite foods! One thing about MFP  the calorie numbers are off that it will recommend to you. Calculate your total calorie expenditure called a TDEE at this website and plug that into MyFitnessPals custom calorie settings. EDIT Formatting fix.,xxfitness,chn9uvo,2,t5_2ryzy

When I go to the real gym I always deadlift do pullups often curls skull crushers ohp calf raises hanging leg raises ab roll outs and for machines the hip abductor and adductor.

Search this subreddit for progress pics if your idea of huge muscles in your head is an image of a male bodybuilder. I personally think that some of the strongest posters here look absolutely gorgeous but I like that muscular look.

I was surprised to find that squatting xweek and deadlifting xweek actually made me feel better and didnt run me down because the weights were lighter. I got a lot of quality practice in and really improved my speed. Also I love doing lots of low rep sets.At my meet in November my lifts were  at  lbs bodyweight.

Either holding them at your side or on your shoulders. You can do front squats where you can easily bail by dumping the barbell forward. You can do singleleg work like youve been doing. Singleleg squats will challenge your stability and mobility. Stepups where you do not use your back leg at all split squats with rear foot elevated reverse lunges etc.,xxfitness,cj5lday,1,t5_2ryzy

If Im on the treadmill my arms just rub the sleeves of the tshirt back and forth my  hands will get caught on the bouncing and flowing baggy tshirt bottom. My shoes will get caught on my otherfoots pant cuff and I could very easily trip.When I used to be inshape Id go to the gym in kneelength athletic shorts and just a sports bra so bare midriff but it was mostly because I was lazy and didnt want to wear another layer if I didnt have to.

1607396,0,t3_2cpjdi,I think that this is a pretty overly dramatic approach to this topic.... I mean come on... LowTestosterone Epidemic?? Dont get me wrong I know first hand what kind of problems the wrong birth control can cause.Basically I was on the pill for about  years when I got pregnant because apparently my family is just SUPER fertile. After I had my son I switched to Implanon. Unfortunately it did not agree with my system and threw my whole body out of whack. I lost my sex drive I was gaining weight despite running  daysweek it sparked anxiety flare ups which in turn caused me to have pretty dramatic OCD episodes I was lethargic most of the time I was depressed I felt AWFUL. I finally worked myself up to go see a doctor who immediately yanked me off the Implanon and put me on nonhormonal Paragard IUD.My situation was pretty rare. The majority of women have no issues whatsoever when put on birth control. In fact I didnt even have issues for the first  years while on birth control. When I was younger I had a hell of a sex drive despite being on birth control. But like most things bodyrelated it went through cycles. Id have high sex drive cycles and low sex drive cycles. A good part of my low sex drive cycles related to other things going on in my life unhappiness in relationships stress etc. Now that Im on a nonhormonal option my sex drive is back in full force but again Im sure a big part of that is related to the fact that I am much happier in my relationship. Well that and the hormones arent triggering my anxiety anymore...Long story short too late I think its not quite as big of an issue as this article makes it out to be. For some its a legitimate problem but for most of us its not a big enough issue to warrant anything like testosterone replacement therapy or getting off birth control completely. Dont be stupid it leads to preggers people! Practice safe sex! Trust me Im a mom and Im pretty sure Im required to make some sort of speech like this...,xxfitness,cjhs36u,2,t5_2ryzy

I have to eat a lot IMO but I do because I want to see results. It helps if you plan out for food ahead and dont feel guilty if it isnt always clean food.

Its the skinny ones the young ones the old ones the men no matter their age or weight.  Yoga is a journey and all that cheesy stuff.  Everyone struggles with something in class  even if they would call it an opportunity for challenge or improvement and not something as negative as a struggle.

1825248,0,t3_2fg6r1,This post reminded me of a yoga blog I follow on Tumblr that gives skinny little me something to look forward to and inspire to with regular yoga practice As much as Western yoga culture has become about being lithe and bendy and upside down for me it has always been about looking inwards and checking in with myself. I dont notice the size of the other people in the room or who is struggling to hold their warrior or dancers pose because Im too busy putting two blocks under my butt to attempt to get anywhere near pigeon pose or trying to reach my toes without collapsing my lower back in seated forward fold. I rejoice in the power of my thighs when I can get deep into utkatasana and marvel at my progress when my fingertips can finally just barely touch the ground in my half hanumanasana. I modify the shit out of my poses because I know that my stiff body needs to build a solid foundation before I can attempt the full expressions and if the other sweaty ladies around me are judging me for it from their mermaid binds then so be it that just means theyre probably not getting the full benefit of focusing on their own practice. I cant pretend to know what its like to be a fat girl at yoga but I do know what its like to be someone who is bad at yoga and keeps coming back I always tell people that Im not flexible because I go to yoga I go to yoga because Im not flexible. People of all different body types and abilities practise yoga and a lot of them are judged for it but the important thing is that were practising not whether were good at it or if our body looks like others think it should in our stretchy pants.,xxfitness,ck94sgs,12,t5_2ryzy

1860963,0,t3_2fvyjx,As with most things in life I try to reach back to my  year old self and what she would think. Chiseled abs? Losing weight? Gaining weight? Boobs too small? Too big? What on earth are you talking about? Youre boring me! Look at my drawing of a cat climbing a rainbow!I remember feeling invincible when I was a kid. I didnt care what I looked like I played a bunch of sports played outside constantly and came home covered in mud. Somewhere along the line I lost that confidence and I exercised for looks instead of enjoyment. I had an AhHa! moment in my second year of university when I was volunteering with a community building project. We were flattening some ground in a school yard to fill with concrete and build a basketball court for an elementary school. I had spent most of the day hauling wheelbarrows of dirt andor cement mix back and forth from pile to pile and at the end of the project we were asked to reflect on our greatest takeaway from the day and share it with the group. For me I was proudest of how truly strong and capable my body is and that no one had ever really given me the chance to prove it before. I shared how I was always told I was weak or not fit but that wasnt true I moved freakin wheelbarrows of heavy shit with these noodly pipes of mine! Everyone was really surprised that I thought I was weak and kept telling me I was really strong and they were amazed with how much hard I pushed myself. The lightbulb went off for me because those were things I used to know about myself and thought to be true. How did I lose that?So now I try to think of how to keep my  year old self alive and how to make her proud. Like I said she wouldnt think having visible abs makes me a better person or care if I was  lbs too light or too heavy at  years old. Shed think moving wheelbarrows of cement around so other kids could have a basketball court was pretty cool. Shed be totally jazzed to find out Id completed multiday hiking treks and summited mountains in the Himalayas and the Canadian and American Rockies. She would be proud of me for completing my first Half Marathon because that seems like something a grownup would do. And Id be her freakin superhero because I play Roller Derby.I shake off the pressure to look a certain way because its not important. It never has been and it never will be. My body is SO capable at my current weight. And it will still be hella capable of doing rad things whether I gain some pounds or lose it. I know its hard to tell yourself that every day when youre bombarded with confusing and bodyshaming messages from all outlets but my  year old self knew better and Im sure yours did too.,xxfitness,ckdfvj1,25,t5_2ryzy

I usually estimate based on averages and how hard I actually feel I worked. I love group classes like Les Mills Body Jam Body Step Shbam Body Pump etc but I think they are making my joints worse. The thing is I really enjoy them and they make me happy so Im finding it hard to give them up.

1922148,0,t1_ckkixcq,I just want to share another story to try to break down the thinking youve exhibited in this thread. The other day I went to a new gym while out of town and I was something of a... Spectacle there. Apparently the clientele was mostly older people just trying to stay fit via elipticalcircuit training while I was a  kinda built female powerlifter benching and doing handstands. I dont think it matters but if you do I dont break rules one or two.One guy did watch me for a while a little weirdly and then say something like its nice to have something fun to watch in the gym which was weird and inappropriate. But another guy interrupted his workout to give me a series of several awesome spots was super sweet and encouraging and congratulated me on my new max. He was married and his eyes never left my face once and the only time he looked at me during my workout was to see if I was flagging him down. When his friend came in another middleaged white guy they started talking about baby carriers while lifting which was pretty damn cute. His friend was nice too totally appropriate and also gave a nod of respect for my lift. I didnt get a single side eye. If I hadnt needed the spot who would I have noticed? Definitely the creepy guy. But there were x more nice polite guys there I just didnt notice them because they were nice and polite. Some people suck. I will grant you that. But many MANY more people treat me like a human than treat me like a sex object. Maybe ANYONE treating me like a sex object is too high but thats a different discussion. All Im saying is not every guy who speaks to me in the gym has an ulterior motive. Even gym bros are people. To your main point does that mean I owed them conversation? Not at all and a quick and reasonable shutdown is fine form. BUT it also doesnt mean that they picked up the conversation BECAUSE they felt I owed it to them.

1935900,0,t3_2gtap1,Mine has been supportive over the years weve been together for over a decade but I think supportiveness has its limits when you get the feeling the other person has stopped trying.I went to the doctor two and a half years ago for snoring he changed my diet I followed his recommendations and I went from around lbs to lbs in a matter of  months. My highest weight was around  and I hung out around  during the years of  despite different diets  years of vegetarianism and many many workout plans. The main cook in the house my boyfriend changed the meals he makes so that I could eat along my docs recommendation of a paleolike food lifestyle though he gets kind of mopey about giving up spaghetti and shepherds pie and pizza dont you think I hated mostly giving those up too? I love shepherds pie . Hes made food sacrifices for me and I was super good the first year about eating exactly what my doctor told me to eat and it worked  I got down to  though I never broke the barrier to .I used to outweigh him by over  pounds now we weigh around the same. So hes proud of me for the progress Ive made. However its been two years since I saw significant progress and Ive put on  pounds this past  months that have been very stubborn about sticking around. The shine is off the apple of my new body and I think hed like me to hurry up and lose the rest of the weight Ive been wanting to get rid of for the last few years my GW is ish so we can go back to eating like normal. I have been frustrated with my plateauing and I think he knows that and has been frustrated himself when he sees me eating things that are not working toward that goal. I remember he spontaneously dropped by my office last year during lunch and found me eating a pork chop sandwich someone bought them for the office to support the local band booster club and he gave me crap for it since Ive made such a big effort to avoid breads and here I was eating bread. He has made big sacrifices for me when it comes to food so it was like I was making him give up all the foods he loves while secretly eating them behind his back. And I was! I cant deny it! I kind of didnt want to eat the sandwich but I thought Whats a little bread going to hurt? It was not usual for me but it happened and he was there to see it. And I felt like a jerk. Sometimes I have candy at the office. Infrequently very infrequently I have a fullsugar cappuccino. Im usually very good about making food choices along my docs recommendations when buying food to prepare at the house but something about grabbing a snack has me making excuses that I deserve something sugary carby junky and lots of it. Having someone who reinforces that Ive made a conscious decision to be on this path is useful and it sucks to see that theyre disappointed especially when they end up making sacrifices too.He doesnt give a fuck about my fitness stuff to be honest and once expressed irritation that I still waste my time with being a moderator over at fitnessfood goal subreddit rdaysgoal. When are you going to get bored of that already? I have a mostlydefunct fitness blog that he used to love reading he woke me up laughing late one night in bed while reading the post I made about my failed dirt brownies But I havent updated much lately as my posts over the last year are boring updates about my injuries and needing new pants and blah blah.My habits aside from common meals dont rub off on him. He eats whatever he wants his snacky cakes are a constant on my grocery list and doesnt really put on much fat  he has always been svelte. He doesnt really care about my running my walking with the dogs my occasional hulahooping or my weightlifting. He lets me do my own thing and I let him do his. He is a little muscular already from doing manual labor over the last two years and hes always had some muscle tone even when he was in a cube farm from woodworking. He was going to the gym at his university but he stopped midway last semester and hasnt gotten back into the habit just yet this semester though it is on his agenda. I dont push it. He will go or he wont and if he enjoys it Im happy for him.I hope that Im able to get back into more scrupulous eating habits so I can get to where I want to be physically  I have newish pants that I have put aside the waist having gotten too tight to wear comfortably anymore and I dont like that feeling! And I want to be able to have a nice spaghetti dinner with my boyfriend every once in a while without feeling like Im undoing two years worth of hard work. And I want him to be proud of me and not disappointed in me. I am proud of myself and I know Im not perfect I want him to continue to be proud of me  and I want to prove to him that I can stick to the promises Ive made so he doesnt feel like his sacrifices and his energy have been in vain.,xxfitness,ckmgqi8,5,t5_2ryzy

Come home OMG NEED FOOD COOK IMMEDIATELY.Im preparing some delicious Mexican food and reheat some refried beans. I go to carry the plastic container over to the counter when suddenly I feel a little faint and the container drops to the ground.And it EXPLODES. Scorching hot refried beans go EVERYWHERE. All over the stove. All over the floor. The cabinet. My gym clothes.And a giant glob rockets up five and a half feet and lands squarely on my neck.OH THE HUMANITY THE PAIN. MEXICAN FOOD WHY HAVE YOU BETRAYED ME!?!Now Im in the bathroom running as much cold water over my neck as I can while my boyfriend is doing his best to clean up the beanpocalypse which has taken over the kitchen. A large warning gross bit of skin peels off my neck which I think indicates a nd degree burn.Wonderful boyfriend is a trooper and runs out to get some burn ointment and neosporin which I have applied liberally ever since. hours later it still hurts and I have given up ever going to the gym while fasted ever again. And it looks like I have a giant hickey which I cant cover up with makeup because yknow its a giant open wound.TLDR I cant decide which is more embarrassing letting people assume Im walking around with work with a giant hickey or trying to explain to people that I somehow managed to get a nd degree burn via refried beans.TLREALLY DR Beware of doing HIIT while fasted.

If I get Chipotle for lunch Ill want it for dinner too and the next thing I know im out  and havent eaten anything but burritos for days. If Im making pizza rolls I cant stop at  or . I make  and eat them all. My boyfriend works at an ice cream place so you can imagine how that goes. When I have a craving I will make everyone miserable until Im satisfied.I think the junky saltfat addiction has roots in a physical need but is now emotional.

It was all I ate for a long time though so now theres no excuse.

2078369,0,t3_2io7x7,I think your program is too intense.A x system when really done near max capacity every time is really intensive and draining on the nervous system. So are plyometrics. So is HIIT. The volume of your program is not the problem people can easily work out every day if they want but not at that intensity level.As an ex athletics coach I can tell even athletes schedule only a couple of high intensity days in a week the rest of the training is moderate to low intensity. Of course they also vary the intensity level week by week but as a generalization this is true.Your body will build muscle and gain strength at rest when are you letting your body truly rest? Especially when youre on your feet all day.I would change the lifting routine to something other than x so that you would be working with lower percentage of your max. This will lower the intensity of the lifting days.Alternatively I would drop one of the lifting days and replace it with low intensity cardio or even a rest day.,xxfitness,cl40893,3,t5_2ryzy

2127152,0,t3_2j9f7z,If your quads and hamstrings are so much stronger it is REALLY hard to not let them take over. Warm up with glute activating exercises do them slow focus on what it feels like when squeezing your glutes. Start with bodyweight and learn how to activate them otherwise your body will always try and take the easy way out and rely on your quads when things get heavy. I never felt my glutes before either until I did the Strong Curves program and learned how to focus on them. When doing glute bridges lift your toes off the floor so you are driving through your heels and make sure that you are really tilting your pelvis up and squeezing your glutes rather than relying on your back and quadsmaybe a form check could tell you if your positioning is ideal. I think the single leg glute bridge is really challenging and good at isolating the glutes. I find sumo deadlift and goblet squats help. I also really like bent knee cable pullthroughs and kettlebell swings. Try doing a Bulgarian split squat but go down really slow and then drive back up through your front heel keeping your shin vertical so you dont rely on the front quad. If you are doing these moves and really trying to drive through the heels and focus on the glutes and you still dont feel anything then it might be helpful to see a physical therapist who can work with you on mind muscle connection to get them firing.,xxfitness,cla7hae,1,t5_2ryzy

2181851,0,t1_clh0y15,Ill second negatives. I tried to work up towards my first chin up using an assisted pullup machine but that didnt really carry over to the real thing. What worked was doing negatives and also just getting through as much of the ROM of the regular chinup as possible.Starting from the top position is an excellent way to progress to full chinups. Use a box and jump your way to the top position lower yourself down and then immediately put everything youve got into pulling yourself back up. You might only be able to raise yourself through less than th of the ROM coming up but this is something that will improve as you get stronger. Starting each attempt from the top means youre doing a negative through the full ROM while also allowing you to attempt the ascent with maximal contraction of the muscles thanks to the stretch reflex at the bottom. This isnt something you get when you do the movement starting from the bottom and is actually a good reason to start all your chinups from the top even when youre beyond this learning progression.Finally this might be one of the few occasions where the bicep curl has a legitimate place in a strength training program. Obviously you need to be doing overhead pressing and squats to develop your stabilising muscles but curls again like chinups you should start them from the top position will train your biceps which will help you with that first chinup. Once you can do a full chinup however ditch the curls since the chinups and moreover weighted chinups are the superior exercise.,xxfitness,clh5zsj,7,t5_2ryzy

2233126,0,t1_clnnveb,I used to long distance run and havent in Fabletic but I think I can at least try to answer this. For one I have the Salar earth legging. Salar is famous for running small and id agree. I wear a small in most everything but had to size up to a medium. These have a surprisingly strong compression. I think its the material they use its white inside and then the pattern on the outside which seems to make it tighter? Maybe a little bit heavier. But its  a huge win as you cant see through them.But damn are these bad boys hard to get on. I used to wear Under Armour compression capris to run and these have a better compression than those. Id almost put them in the category of biking shorts serious compression. Or even like my Triathlon bibs type of compression or better yet like a swimsuit. That kind of compression.  With that said I havent noticed them being tight while im working out. I do a lot of explosive type movements and a lot of olympic movements so if they were hindering me being able to squat low enough or whatever. Id notice. I really liked how warm these ended up being. I have a pair of running Lululemon leggings that are specifically made for cold weather. These are a bit warmer or at least on par with them. The fabric breathes well if it didnt Id notice right off. I ran in Phoenix Arizona in the summer......outside. I got very sensitive to certain material it had to breathe or I seriously felt like I was suffocating. These will at first maybe feel like they wont as they are tight but once I got started I didnt think twice about them. The only drawback Id say is I thought the waist was going to roll on me. I was convinced of it but once I got started and gave them a chance to break in a little they seemed to do just fine. And I never felt like I needed to hitch them up or anything. Honestly for the price at least with the VIP deal which you can cancel right after you get it. Id go for it. The Oula tank that comes with the Solar pants I bought. I would have died for in Phoenix super nice light material perfect for hot summer running. BUT down size in it. I typically wear a medium in most all exercise shirts but not this bad boy. Whew even a small is a bit baggy which for running is great but not so much when youre standing on your head. Hope this helps! Oops Ive never noticed chafing. But Ive only ever noticed that with Target and a couple of Old Navy. I stick with Lululemon Athleta Under Armour and Nike. Id happily add more Fabletic actually I plan to.

2236236,0,t3_2krka9,The Here we Go Again answer is that there is no trick. Im at my lowest body fat ever and I still have the pouch. Some of us are just predisposed to carry weight there. Love your pouch!Some people though have found that they have poor posture and this exacerbates the size and appearance of their pouch. Strength training will improve your posture and strengthen your core which can improve your appearance. Look for a beginners strength training program either with weights or a bodyweight program if you do not have access to weights. Dietwise I find that alcohol immediately makes me look bloated not that that has stopped me from drinking it. My stomach also looks flatter when I avoid simple carbs. Salty foods increase water retention which may make you bloated. If youve read the FAQ you will see why cardio is not necessarily enough to achieve appearance based goals. Building muscle through strength training as another poster has said will help you achieve aesthetic goals but its not necessarily a cardio vs weightlifting eitheror thing.

2289435,0,t3_2ldx7d,You should only be sore in your legs and core if youre actually doing it right. Rowing is almost all leg power which is usually a common misconception. I rowed for  years in college and it took me a while to get the form right. You want to push off with your legs and then swing back with your lower back. Then pull the handle so that it touches the bottom on your bra strap then immediately extend your arms back out.  Keep watching videos. Its tough but you can hurt yourself if youre not doing it right. Good luck!!,xxfitness,cluov6v,2,t5_2ryzy

Either way I think the best way past this fear is to acknowledge that you feel selfconscious and try to work through it. Keep your focus on yourself. How does your body feel after that last set? What part of your form are you working on in your next one? Wear headphones or ask your husband to distract you between lifts.

I put it away for years because I hated it being so big  and I didnt think it was that fashionable when I was . Then at university I took it with me because its a warm coat that might be useful. So it got cold and I tried it on I couldnt do it up! I put this down to excuses such as oh Ive just grown Topshop sizes are ridiculously small etc. Things like this had been happening to me from when I stopped dancing at  until I went to buy a strapless bra last winter and I saw backfat! I had never understood what backfat was or felt so repulsed by my own body! Since then Ive been really good with exercise since March this year using MFP since August but consistently for  weeks at .kg a week and viola! I can now wear this coat even with poofy layers without a problem! Im still working on the backfat though! But it does show that its not just about the exercise the diet is incredibly important. I think its especially important for women with male SOs do those of you with female SOs have the same problem? because its so tempting to eat what they eat and not realise how calorific it is!  MFP is great for that and has completely changed how me amp my SO cook food for each other.

We have completely different bodies and day to day lives. I cook a healthy dinner and he eats that and then two meals more. Plus a midnight snack. I drink tea and watch HBO! And congrats on the work you have done thats awesome  ,xxfitness,cmj4vvq,9,t5_2ryzy

2488329,0,t1_cmj4xjp,I dont think so. Unless you managed to have form so bad that the muscles werent actually being used? But thats kind of impossible. Are you progressing in weights? It may be that youre not eating enough or you arent lean enough to see what progress you have made. Women dont bulk up quickly anyway.Hip stretches are good. There are two I like Get into a deep squat with your legs fairly wide apart feet pointing out whatevers comfortable really put your hands together like youre praying and push your knees out with your elbows. Lean back on your heels and keep your chest up torso upright. Another one is to go into a sort of lunge with one knee on the floor and lean back until you feel a stretch. Other than stretches foam rolling and mobility exercises Im not sure what else you can do... Maybe try not to sit for extended periods of time? Like stand up every  minutes or something.  ,xxfitness,cmjd2lh,1,t5_2ryzy

You really want to be sure youre keeping your back  tight. It helps create the delt shelf that the bar is supposed to rest on. I find that keeping my hands narrow really helps to remind me to keep my back together.  gtIm guessing your placement is a little off and you are ending up relying a little too much on your armsshoulders to keep the bar from slipping completely down your back. Which when you look at the position its in puts a lot of strain on your shoulders when it gets even a little heavy.gtRippetoe has a pretty nice video on bar placement and tips. Its a little long but helpful. Im . sure he has a video on low bar in general as well never seen it but considering him Im sure it exists just look around.gtOtherwise it might be a flexibility issue?gtAnd then theres just those people I know who seem to never be able to do low bar without pain.Hopefully that helps at least a little. ,xxfitness,cmn8ki1,2,t5_2ryzy

Low bar squat requires you to sit back and shift the torso forward in order to bring the bar to your center of gravity. High bar requires you to sit straight down with an upright torso because the bar starts off at the center of gravity. .

2628508,0,t3_2pzof5,I did CK too and I think the only problem youre having there is being too hard on yourself. It is totally normal to be running  minute miles at the end of the program IIRC that was my speed. And running is always going to make out put of breath and sweaty thats the great thing about it its high intensity so we can get a lot of exercise done in a short period of time. Pat yourself on the back for your running accomplishments youre doing well!Now min Ks may be a solid time for us beginners but it is slow in the big scheme of things and wanting to decrease that time is a good goal. Best way to do that is ramping up your mileage. Increase slowly! to maybe  miles per week and see how your times look then. If youre enjoying it then and want to put more time in lots of people run more than that   but start with a goal youre sure you can hit. You may like training for a longer distance as a way to increase k is popular after CK. Once youve finished a K program your K time will have dropped by several minutes.It wont be easy getting faster takes time and hard work but thats why youll be proud when you achieve it right? People are most likely to quit running at around the two month mark and the four month mark so be most vigilant against the urge to quit around then. If you keep working you WILL get results life throws a lot of curve balls at us but every run makes you that much stronger.,xxfitness,cn1oj6i,2,t5_2ryzy

DONT QUIT! Its taking longer because you have more ground to cover than you did back in   more weight to lose more bad habits to erase. It took you a whole year the first time. Be patient and try not to be too hard on yourself! You have already made a lot of changes  you revamped your diet youve almost finished CK you quit smoking and are weaning yourself from nicotene...damn thats a lot of hard work! You deserve to be proud of all of that instead of just being sad about all the stuff you havent done yet. You will meet your goals and it will be hard and timeconsuming but you will do it because you want it badly enough. Keep going with your running  you have to build up endurance before speed so focus on that first and dont worry about your times just now. Speed comes eventually. I dont think you should eat less losing weight slowly is healthier than starving yourself. Besides you have likely lost more than just three pounds of fat  you are running and lifting so what is likely is that youve replaced a few pounds of fat with muscle only the number on your scale cant reflect that change.

The reason being for me that the withdrawal symptoms were absolutely horrendous and would appear even if you were a couple hours late taking the pill. This was often for me since I was in school and worked evenings so I had the least regular schedule. However it does react different for everyone and I would say your doctor probably knows you best. But I do have to warn you about the withdrawal it was terrible. I also couldnt lose any weight on Effexor but when I was off of it I dropped ten pounds instantly and have been successful in losing weightmaintaining even though Im far less diligent in tracking my energy expenditurecalories every day now. But its important to note talk to your doctor. Everyone experiences things differently I just cant not mention my experience with this. I dont usually get bothered by pain or anything but I was incapable of functioning once the withdrawal kicked in. Feel free to PM me with any questions though!

2689235,0,t1_cn9l8nx,Thanks for your reply .I actually did talk to my PCP earlier this year and he put me on Qsymia which is just a hardcore appetite suppressant thats super expensive so I stopped that after  months and then an endocrinologist in October. That was the first time I learned that I was obese so it was a real wake up call. They didnt find anything wrong with the thorough labs that were run. The only other thing it might be is my IUD. I have Mirena which isnt supposed to leave local circulation around the uterus so theoretically those hormones shouldnt be affecting my eating habits or weight. But Ive heard anecdotes of women who have had problems with it. I love it because it makes birth control SO much easier and so NovemberFebruary was my trial period. If I could focus and lose weight at a healthy but effective pace then Id keep it. But if theres no weight loss Ill have to remove it. So Im slightly desperate to see some movement on the scale lol. Would you recommend some sort of fasting routine too? Ive read about intermittent fasting a little... Should I decrease calories more? Or increase?Ill push myself to do some cardio. I can and will look up more info on cardio routines but what do you think is a good nonrunning routine? Is biking sufficient? How many hours a day would you recommend for cardio days? And by offlifting days do you mean two days a week or all  days that Im not lifting? Could I do cardio and lifting on the same day or is that not as effective?Also whats a bb complex routine?Sorry for all the questions. Need to get this down lol. ,xxfitness,cn9lphk,4,t5_2ryzy

2728973,0,t1_cne3n5k,Short answer yes.  But sometimes we gotta do what we gotta do.  As a runner I always wore Brooks and my shoes were always .  And then I was seriously injured and running was out walking only.  Well walking shoes need a bit different distribution of padding on the bottom more under the toe less flex there and I had to start over finding a walking shoe that fit me like Brooks did for running.  And I went through some hard times.  I eventually round Rykas and for me its a nice balance.   Just under  a shoe and a really good fit for the life of the shoe.  The trick is the life of these shoes is about  miles where Brooks would be a solid .  For me its a great trade off and its easier to plan for in my budget.  If the shoes you found fit well then work them but track your mileage.  You might get  miles out of them and need to replace them.  If you notice aches and pains up your legs to your hips anywhere I would assume that they arent working for you sooner.,xxfitness,cne9txs,4,t5_2ryzy

2741824,0,t1_cnf5k2a,gt So to be told by half the people that I cant get bulky because Im a girl and to be told by the other half that bulky is good and I should be proud is frustrating. Omg this is everything. I was lucky enough to have found a small gym with very knowledgeable and devoted trainers who have literally changed my life. Ive lost a bunch of weight and couldnt be more thankful for them! But now that Im slimmer and can see the muscle Ive built underneath the fat Ive lost its freaking me out because its just not what I want to look like. And all I hear at my gym is strong is the new sexy! and be a beauty and a beast! and all of these proripped things and while I totally respect and admire my fellow women who have that goal I just...dont. That gym has become such a core component of my life and Im having a really hard time reconciling the kind of lifting and strengthtraining we do there with my personal body goals. You are not alone.I read that Bret Contreras article that someone posted below  I agree that its exactly what Im looking for and its a shame that its such a taboo topic in the fitness industry. More people should be talking about this! Either way I think nutrition is so much of it  I know that the men at my gym who are trying to bulk up eat a ton of carbs before and especially after training so Ive been trying to cut out all nonveggie carbs in the afternoon and night when I work out and stick to lean proteins and greens. I know male and female body chemistry is different but Im hoping for the best. Good luck to you!,xxfitness,cnfqfny,2,t5_2ryzy

2790621,0,t3_2s15cr,Honestly this sounds like one of the most sensible plans Ive seen posted on here by a newbie. So THANK YOU as a mod who often deals with people who have spent no time reading the FAQ but think they KNOW FOR SURE that their question wont be answered there.  rantWith regards to your question I would add a bit of cardio in as uLinguiste suggests. Very popular nowadays are what are called finishers  the idea being that once youre done with anaerobic work lifting you add in a wallop of aerobic work usually in the form of tabatas or very fast calisthenics. Personally I like tabata because its neat and easy to fit in depending on how much time you have. Its secs work secs rest repeated  times to make  minutes. You can do just one or you can try to do  of those. They really tax you though ESPECIALLY after heavy lifting so start with one round only while youre new and work your way up. For example Burpees alternating with skipping would be sec burpees s rest s skipping s rest s burpees s rest s skipping etc. until the  minutes is up.If youre doing these after a full lifting routine Id advise staying away from things like pushups on bench day for example... just because your form will probably suck by the time you get to the end of your workout. Keep it fast keep it active and if you end up doing multiple rounds definitely give yourself mins in between each round. You can also apply the same thing to running if you enjoy it sec fast jog s walk etc. Or even reverse it and try s absolute allout sprint then s walk. Thatll get your heart pumpin!,xxfitness,cnla7wu,3,t5_2ryzy

I suggest supplementing a power lifting program with some auxiliary exercises particularly for glutes. I also recommend that you at least get SOME coaching so you can learn technique.

2896061,0,t1_cnx8mpb,Okay.  I see that I should have been more in depth and more clear about kettlebells as I know theyre a type of weight not a program per say.   I used to supplement my cardio as possible with machines.  I generally followed a lower bodycoreupper body  day split as cardio is still my focus.  I stopped everything after I had an ITB injury in July which also led to the discovery of hyperflexia in my knees Im on my feet all the time at work so recovery is taking forever.  Now Im looking to add strength training back into my routine.  My goal is to improve and balance my overall strength upper body is much weaker than lower body improve my health and lose a bit of weight.  At this point in time I dont picture myself as someone striving to bench xx pounds deadlift xx so forth which has kind of steered me away from free weightbarbells.  Instead Id like to see functional strength easier rock climbing easier time getting out of the pool so forth.  I should also mention that I have never lifted with free weights or a barbell and quite frankly Im scared Ill injure myself.  Right now Im lacking a gym buddy to show me the ropes.

And who cares what other people think of how hot we each are and whether our hotness matches? What matters is we find each other hot. Youre so concerned about what is objectively attractive it doesnt sound like youve asked yourself what you consider attractive? Do these gym guys personalities matter at all?

The upward motion of the squat is the contraction of your glutes and posterior chain and the part where you should be clenching your butt. Mark Rippetoes post on this thread second one down goes into more detail. I highly recommend you read more on the mechanics of that hereId start warming up with exercises that isolate your glutesI like to do a couple glute bridges.

New beginners arent really putting on muscle they are increasing loads by neural adaptation and increasing lubrication in their muscles. If you want to put on muscle mass you absolutely do need to eat above maintenance. He said no then in longer words said yes.  At the start it can feel and look like you are gaining muscle but if you dont take that with a grain of salt you may believe it is possible to continue that without eating at a surplus and it is not.

It turns out that my beautiful artsyfartsy friend really really really likes muscle so when I started to flex she got reaaaaaaal close and personal and started touching my biceps with permission of course were very handsy people. She then spent the next  minutes just feeling all of the muscle that Ive gained. It sounds really weird when I tell the story but it was totally incredible.

If you can do it for a few reps and then not after it might mean your back is just tired and you end up compensating with your arms.Personally in a circumstance like that Id lower the weight or step your feet backwards so the rows are easier to a point where you can perform all your desired reps with the proper muscle actions.,xxfitness,coqkdfh,1,t5_2ryzy

Couldnt exercise  hours prior as it increases your BMR and had to be fasted. I will often consume  calories in a day to gain weight very slowly. Through calorie tracking I see that some days I eat very little to counter balance days I eat a lot of food. Lessons learned I need to ensure I eat more than  calories a day but more importantly my NEAT and exercise energy expenditure is pretty high so if I wanted to lose weight  would be extremely low. You indicated you work out  times a week   times a week of other workouts putting you at  days a week of exercise. What do you do outside of exercise? Do you sit in a chair all day or do you walk around and do other things? Do you know what you were eating before? If you track a week or so of caloric intake and you find you are weight stable at  calories per day then you do not need to eat  a day and can lose weight fairly fast with  a day. The key is daily activity levels.  can be too low or just fine it depends on the person. If it is too low you will know right away as you will have rapid weight loss but also feel sluggish. ,xxfitness,corlrpa,1,t5_2ryzy

3200478,0,t1_cotodkf,Oh gosh I had growing pains when I was . The athletic trainer at my school couldnt really explain them apart from puberty. I got most of my height before and during early puberty so once the main stages of puberty hit it was like my hips and boobs and everything else had to catch up to my height. It kept me out of soccer for several weeks and everything including walking hurt like a bitch. After a while my coach started saying he was suspicious that I was faking and I gave him a look like I was about to punch him in the nuts. He shut up after that.Im definitely going to get on a regular TVstretching routine. That will make a nice study break. I have found sitting a lot and stress aggravate things more but yes I agree with you  as an active person this has more to do with my anatomy than it does activity.Most of my friends are active people. The catch right now is that Im a super busy grad student so I hit the gym when its convenient for me but not many of my friends. Plus I use it as me time.

However I dont lift  Im a runner and my morning workouts are in the  mile range or crosstraining on the stationary bike for  minutes... not sure if there would be any difference for lifting rather than cardio.  If Im doing a long run of mi on a weekend starting around  or am and I ate dinner pretty early the night before Ill sometimes roll out of bed and have a spoonful of sunflower seed butter or a quarter to a half of a protein bar before I get dressed and get my waterfuel together and that gives me enough time for it to settle a bit before I start running!

However while some elite lifters have squats gt deadlift in my humble opinion if your squat is gt than your DL you are likely cheating your squat. It is much easier to cheat a squat than a DL. Post a form check of both and people here can give you better advice. If you are not cheating the squat it could be that your squat is still relatively light for the strength in your legs vs the strength in your posterior chainback which you use in the DL.

3222940,0,t3_2x1azs,Two things. SL and SS are beginner programs and they are designed to quickly and efficiently exhaust your capacity for linear progression where you add  lbs every time you go in. Once your linear progression is exhausted you are supposed to switch to an intermediate program. So you are following the lifts from these programs but clearly not the loading scheme for these programs if youve been doing them since .  The loading scheme is an integral part of any program.  Add weight to the bar every single time you go. When you fail a set try again the next session. If you fail three sessions in a row deload and go back to adding  lbs every time. Once youve gone through  deloading cycles the next time you fail a lift its time for a new program! You said your primary goal is to lose weight. Changing around your lifting program isnt going to be a major factor in that endeavor. Its gotta come from your diet. You may believe  is maintenance but if youre eating at  and staying the same weight that defines maintenance. Your maintenance is currently . Reduce from there. Online calculators are just an estimate.Many people poopoo the idea that an extended period of caloric deficit can drive your metabolism into the dirt making you feel sluggish and making weight loss difficult. Personally Ive seen too much support for the idea scientific and anecdotal to ignore it. You might try adding calories back into your diet very slowly like  calweek slow. As counterintuitive as it seems many people have found theyll end up maintaining weight at a much higher calorie level than they were previously. See if you can get your engines running a little hotter and then try cutting again.Edit I also just now saw that youve only been counting calories since the end of January?

3306628,0,t3_2xsqly,She is becoming dependent on you to police her eating and exercise. You have to stop. You will continue to have success in your lifestyle change and she will eventually begin to feel left behind. The moment you pull away from trying to dictate to her she will likely feel some anxiety and fear and think youve given up on her. It may be what she needs as she will no longer have anything to resist except for herself. I can understand where she is coming from and went through a similar situation with my BF last year. He worked very hard to make changes and was seeing some serious success. I felt like I was never getting anywhere and was relying on him so heavily for everything. I had every excuse and complaint in the book and its shocking the amount of patience he showed me that I didnt deserve. I was so heavily dependent on his direction that it prevented me from taking full responsibility for myself. At some point it nearly drove us to an argument and he backed off and I fell off the wagon for a bit in a serious way. Then I smartened up and realized that he couldnt hold my hand through my own lifestyle change and that I had to do it myself. The amount of confidence I gained when I started making decisions on my own was huge and it really motivated me to keep trying even if I had wanted  to consistently give up before. I am so thankful that he helped me and he still sends me relevant information and helps me to sort things out if I need help but now it seems to be an unspoken agreement that I have to try things on my own and if I need help he is there for me. Ultimately it is up to me to make the changes and do the work it is not up to him to hold my hand and try to pull me along while I dig in my heels. If she doesnt decide to prioritize her health then over time it will drive a wedge between the two of you and I can nearly guarantee it will cause resentment on both sides. But first you have to pull back and take care of you and she needs to learn to take care of herself. ,xxfitness,cp56k23,1,t5_2ryzy

When theres a woman in the weight room I dont even look in that general direction or Ill look at the ceiling or something so theres no preconception that Im looking at them.

And to follow with your comparison women in maledominated workplaces do have nothing to worry about I dont even understand what you mean by have things to worry aboutJust educate yourself beforehand on your program form etc. Put in some headphones and go do your workout. Its not that difficult. People look at each other at the gym checking out their formweight and things. Its not malicious if someone looks at you in the weight room and this sub needs to realize that. Besides the only persons judgement that ultimately matters is your own. Just stop caring what others will think and do what you want in the weightroom.,xxfitness,cpbdwxb,5,t5_2ryzy

3372372,0,t3_2ysvuz,I find that it is fairly ingrained that women should just rest and do nothing while pregnant and eat whatever they want. To me that is baffling. When pregnant the top priorities should be To eat the most nutrient dense diet to feed the baby not most calorie dense. Eat when hungry but eat healthy. Be active in any way to get the benefits of exercise. You dont do exercise to just look good but to be healthier. Being healthier while pregnant makes sense. You dont have to kill yourself doing crossfit x a week while pregnant. Exercise within reason to not injure yourself.If you are ripped and thin when you get pregnant you can stay that way and its not a bad thing. If you get pregnant during pregnancy cut  body fat then I would imagine its probably not the best idea. You should not have to gain  body fat though the weight of the baby placenta etc is not body fat. The reaction comes from jealous people or people who are misinformed and believe women should literally be laying in bed all the time and eating ice cream to fuel that baby. ,xxfitness,cpcobln,5,t5_2ryzy

Some strength training in the form of more intense bodyweight workouts rbodyweightfitness to start if you dont already visit there along with some more calories especially in the form of protein will help you build some strength. The reason you look soft is because no matter how low your body fat is you need something to support the skin. Muscle is harder and is what gives that lean toned look.If you can afford a pullup bar and some dumbbells do it. If you can only afford a  pullup bar definitely do it.And honestly you havent been at it very long and you may just happen to store fat in your belly.

We always feel like someones watching us and making unfair judgments about who we are and what we do in our spare time.  There are a couple of ways to combat this  first tell yourself that your feelings are normal BUT that these people have better things to do than to judge you harshly for being you.  Why?  Because they do.  The majority of people looking at you are going to forget they even saw you about five minutes later.  Fat or thin I look at every person in my gym at some point and I forget about them within minutes because I have my own shit to deal with.  Thats true for most people.The second thing you can do  if youre not in the middle of something that requires absolute concentration  is to give someone you catch looking at you a smilegrinsmirk and a nod.  Acknowledge them.  Theyll either look away once they realize they were staring because many people stare when they zone out or theyll give you a friendly nod back and get back to their thing.  Being friendly with people at the gym is a great way to realize that no ones out to get you there and no one is hating on you.And finally if people point and laugh at you throw a plate like a discus in their general direction.,xxfitness,cpsv62k,92,t5_2ryzy

3516443,0,t3_30hir0,How long have you been taking your medication? If its been over a month and youre not feeling its helping anything at all its time to talk to your doctor whoever prescribed you the medication. You may need a higher dosage of what you are taken or to go ahead and switch to another medication like you said. I have a compulsive eating problem myself and what really helps for me is to preplan my meals. I dont necessarily mean go for a for a full meal plan day but plan what youre going to eat for the day in the morningbefore bed the next day. I use MFP for this I plan everything out and go ahead and prelog it. If its already logged Im less likely to go off track. When you do track do foods you know you can eat. Make sure youre getting enough protein and fat as well to keep the hunger at bay. I find that if Im not actually hungry Im less likely to over eat. If you know something is going to upset your stomach dont include it. When I started logging and eating at my calorie goal I found out VERY FAST that cutting out liquid dairy was a necessity which my previous doctor thought was just IBS. ,xxfitness,cpt3mm7,1,t5_2ryzy

3649137,0,t3_325tro,Deadlift looks quite good. The main thing I see is that you are tapping the bar on the ground between some reps and not letting it rest fully on the ground. Although it wont hurt you physically if you want to get the most out of deadlifting make sure the bar rest as a DEAD weight in between sets otherwise you are using momentum to cheat the initial pulling motion. Second thing I see is it looks like you are hyperextending a bit on lockout. This can lead to back pain later on think about locking out by squeezing your glutes as opposed to your back.Your squat is also pretty darn good. Try not to look straight down as others have said. The main thing I see with your squat is you come up off your heals a bit and it definitely looks like an ankle flexibility issue. Work on stretching but you can also put plates under your heals or buy raised heal lifting shoes. Everything else looks on point.,xxfitness,cq888pm,5,t5_2ryzy

3714259,0,t3_32xscr,These babies are the best hairbands I have ever come across. To get my hair out of the way I can either throw it up in a messy bun type thing or I ponytail it and then put in a bun. For reference my hair is ridiculous. It is super thick and straight and it reaches below my midback. This works for lifting running and yoga for me. The only drawback is that you need to be careful when pulling them out because occasionally it tries to bring some of your hair with it. ,xxfitness,cqfngsp,22,t5_2ryzy

While I think fast food in school lunches is pretty crappy I looked back on my school lunch. In elementary school it was whatever they were serving that day. In middle school we had more choices and in high school we had a ton of choices including stuff like fries milkshakes etc. The kid talking about food and relating junk food in the house to alcohol being Im the house was a good example. I also feel like these parents didnt know what healthy really is like the mom saying that cereals were a good meal replacement.

Moderate exercise as in somewhere between being winded and cant even...not moderate as in easy or slow actually reduces the appetite... well typically. Swimming is a sport known to stimulate the appetite.You also need to build schedule and structure in your life. Its easier to eat healthy when your whole lifestyle supports being healthy.If you stick with it for  weeks youre sure to drop weight like crazy AND make the exercise program part of your routine.Start simple. No fast food no soda no vending machines no eating free food at work is there any love made into a doughnut?. If its homemade with love and care then you can have a small serving.  Pack your lunch girl. Pack your snacks. Look into glycemic index ratings.

3879056,0,t1_cqyc9lp,Carton egg whites have water in them. They do not taste or behave like normal whites. Spaghetti a la Carbonara uses eggs in hot pasta as a base sauce. The hot pasta cooks the eggs. This recipe uses whole eggs but just save the yolks in a tupperware and use them like this for all of your pasta dishes. It sounds weird but dude it is totally delicious and add a ton of protein to pasta dishes as well as satisfying creaminess without cream oils or butter. The texture and flavor of yoks disappears and instead it adds a dimensional flavor and thickness to marina or fresh sauteed veggie topping. The trick is to add the eggs to the hot pasta in the pan and stir until creamy just takes a few minutes. Then add sauteed veggies as a topping  or sauce or meat or whatever you like. Can be used with any pasta.,xxfitness,cqyg2jm,3,t5_2ryzy

Eating a high fat moderate protein and lowno carb diet has been my personal lifesaver in terms of health. Will it work for everyone? Who knows but the key is to find something that you can make a lifestyle.,xxfitness,crmw7a0,2,t5_2ryzy

I barely make it the two blocks to the mailbox I had to stop by and turn around to go home because shes going to dislocate my shoulder with the pulling. On the way back she manages to piss off a swarm of bees so they all start flying around us and then insists to stop and shit. She finishes up and I scoop all while trying not to get stung.

4163707,0,t3_389rpt,Im right there with you in the broke college student boat. During the school year it can seem impossible to make good choices on meal plan. Heres what Ive found works best when it comes to eating healthy at college.Meal plan  easily the most frustrating thing about planning a diet. Most of the staple meals at my school are carbaholic Im talking bread and pasta clogged up with cheese and sauce. The salad bar is always an option for getting veg and some healthy toppings but it can get boring. My advice is to get creative with your options ask the food service people what modifications you can make to dishes. For example I found out I could turn a chicken cheese sandwich with fries into grilled chicken breast over salad  much better!Microwaves  the best investment you can make IMO. Use this to zap frozen veg  for a  oz bag oatmeal  for a container with  servings instant grits same price as oatmeal bacon soups and more. Having one of these made my life a million times easier.Other foods  things like canned tuna fruit and veg yogurt can be very cheap if you know where to shop and what to buy. Explore your local food options and get into couponing! Shopping the sales will save you all that hardearned cash!!I hope this helps you out!

I would have a protein shake after a mediocre workout and think thats all I needed. Nope. So now I make sure I hit at least g of protein a day and I do that by eating broatmeal protein powderoatmeal the Costco premier protein shakes pure protein bars also from Costco tilapia okay just get everything from Costco and hardboiled eggs. Also just like everyone is saying really push yourself with your workouts. Today I decided to squat  my heaviest weight for  reps usually I do  and I ended up doing it fairly easily.

I have to do the same with shirts generally though lately the Banana Republic blouses along with a minimizing bra seem to be cut in such a way that Im not bursting any buttons.  If its a nice blouse with sleeves that wont be rolled I still usually have to have the sleeve taken up.I believe a  inch gap is usually fine for a waist takein too.  My tailor usually maxes out at a . inch pinch of fabric.  It usually requires some adjustment to the seat of the pants as well so they dont have a wierdo pleat in the butt.Nordstrom and Banana Republic and sometimes Macys have inhouse tailors but most cleaners have them as well.  ,xxfitness,ct8me3y,11,t5_2ryzy

4681525,0,t1_ctkmpa5,Vogue is generally the same category of very few straight men will see it.Is it lazy? Sure! Its using sex to sell because using visual appeal to sell products works best. Is this something that women fall victim to more? Yes it is but we also see it with men in advertising. Honestly Im not even truly against using a sexy woman to sell something so long as you give me a scantily clad dude to try to sell me stuff.  Heck as a fit woman who is far more concerned with performance than I am with aesthetic I still LOVE looking good. Looking at how awesome my body looks as a result of my hard work boosts my confidence. It might be the least important thing about me and one of the lesser reasons that I work out but its still great. I love feeling sexy when I get dressed up when I go out to meet my friends at a bar casually dressed in a tank and jeans when Im with the guy Im seeing or even walking around my house naked or in a sports bra and panties.  I dont get dolled up to go to the gym but when I purchase try on workout clothes the most important things are fit comfort quality and functionality. After that its how they look and how I feel in them. If I feel good I have better workouts. I show off my arms and back because they are my best in my opinion feature and when I catch a glimpse of them it motivates me. When Im having a good ab day I wear a sports bra that looks awesome so I can take off my shirt and enjoy them during my workout.In conclusion feeling sexy is important at least to me. I want to buy things that make me feel sexy especially if Im trying to motivate myself to keep going during a workout. Im not saying that using solely sex to sell things that have nothing to do with sex is great but sexy is hardly unnecessary. Sexy also has more to do with how a woman sees herself feels than it does with outside opinion. Frankly I dont give a crap if any man other than one Im having sex with feels like Im sexy but Ive had periods of time where I didnt feel sexy or beautiful and It sucked.  ,xxfitness,ctknieq,13,t5_2ryzy

4692657,0,t3_3f6t8h,Well...For me learning to stop obsessing about the scale was a long process so its hard to pinpoint exactly what was really the turning point.  But one thing that really made a difference I think was taking progress pictures.  It felt really weird to pose in my underwear and take snaps of myself every week especially since I didnt see any noticeable differences when I looked in the mirror.  But when I looked at all the pictures side by side I saw a crazy amount of change even without losing any weight.  My body looked healthier more fit more defined...but I actually weighed more than when I started.  If I had only been looking at the scale and my own skewed perceptions in the mirror I would have thought that my training program had been a miserable failure but progress pics helped to make me see my progress more objectively and less critically.  Also taking body measurements is another objective metric for fitness success that is more accurate than weight alone.  My waist changed from  to  inches during a time when I gained  pounds according the scale.  Its easy to tell yourself over and over that muscle weighs more than fat without actually believing it I know I didnt but seeing that it does really drives the point home!    Eventually by consistently keeping track of my progress through progress pictures measurements and the scale I learned to see that what seemed like heavy amount of weight actually looked good on my body.  When at one time I would have panicked to see my numbers go up now I have other ways to tell if it actually is a set back or if Im still in a good range.  ,xxfitness,ctm1usg,2,t5_2ryzy

You have to build the gym into your schedule.  I guarantee that you have  minutes every day that you could be using for fitness rather than whatever youre using it for unproductively right now.Think about it like saving money.  I have  deducted from every paycheck before I even see the money and disbursed into my retirement account and my sons college fund rather than seeing how much money I have left at the end of the month and saving that.  Likewise when I build my schedule the gym is one of the first things I put on it rather than looking at how much time I have left and trying to squeeze fitness in there.,xxfitness,ctq4e56,1,t5_2ryzy

Eat that many calories fitting your macros as well for one week with a normal exercise routine. Weight yourself at the same time at the beginning and exactly  days later. If your weight is the same that is maintenance for you. If you have lost you can calculate your deficit lbs lost X callbs days  calorie deficit per day. If you have gained lbs gained X lbs  days  calorie surplus per day. Depending on whether you want to gainlose or maintain adjust your daily calorie intake accordingly. ,xxfitness,ctqlpgw,15,t5_2ryzy

Just watch your weight and size and if youre not gaining size or strength eat more caloriesprotein and if youre gaining too muchtoo quickly cut back a bit.

4787630,0,t3_3ggjwg,A friend of mine had a big birthday sleepover for the weekend. A few weeks in advance she took requests for the meal planning over the weekend. Most of the responses from other girls were heavy on the carbs and sweets which made me nervous.Im really prone to severe indigestion in general and on top of that Ive been eating a lowercarb diet of mostly fruit veggies and lean protein for over a year so deviating too much from my normal diet can actually make me feel sick or even throw up.I talked to my friend about it and she reassured me that her family loves fruit and veggies and there would be something I could eat at every meal. It sounded great so I was excited to go.The reality was pretty horrifying. Every meal was  some type of bread or pasta. There was fresh fruit at breakfast both days but one day was french toast and the next was biscuits bacon and gravy. Dinners were tacos pasta and pizza served with a salad that my friends mom positively soaked in olive oil  not dressing even just pure olive oil  and the only fresh vegetables she prepared other than that were ones she immediately dumped in the deep fryer.Saturday night I wound up having to excuse myself before the party really even started because I was getting stomach cramps.

I am not at all saying it isnt a real problem. It is a real problem and it has some solutions. And luckily for women unluckily for men you often need a shockingly little amount of proof for physical assault to equal jail time.Of course I understand! As I mentioned those reasons are a big part of why it took me so long to start running. Ive never been harassed while exercising but I have been harassed in other situations. I do know how terrifying it is and a part of me still worries despite the ample personal experience that it is unlikely to happen to me. Thats again why it took me a while to start running. I was told to expect that same harassment at every turn during my run subtly persuaded that running even encouraged that kind of harassment when in reality its a rarity that can be mitigated and prevented. You should have reported that group of cops to their superiors and filed a formal complaint. Thats absolutely fucking ridiculous that they didnt either stop the guy or escort you to a safer area. Their behavior was unacceptable. Note Obviously all of this specifically addresses harassment during exerciserunning. Of course there are scenarios outside of exercise where you feel you have to do something in an unsafe area and have few options to avoid harassment. I am specifically saying that harassment during running or other exercise is able to be mitigated.

Muscle weighs more so when you first start putting on muscle your actual weight loss can slow plateau or even reverse temporarily but your measurements will be going down. The other benefits to lifting are that having more muscle means that your body burns more calories while resting and your body carries on burning calories for quite a while after doing the lifting as opposed to cardio where you only burn calories while actually doing the exercise. So after the initial slow down of weight loss and initial muscle gain its possible to lose weight more easily.,xxfitness,cuejg1e,1,t5_2ryzy

Ive done my own research but generally speaking I trust them and the professional lifting coaches they bring in because the instruction they give is far superior to what Ive received in the past. Im glad for you that you can lift so much but quite honestly you can find research and opinions on both sides. Am I am expert maybe not. I also know a heck of a lot of people who hurt themselves over the years doing dumb shit with weights. I only brought up the injury to reiterate that hurting ones back is not something you want to do. I was a gymnast growing up and as a result up until pretty recently have had budging disk and nerve issues in my back. Its not fun.

4976256,0,t3_3j2jzq,Not bad. Its tough to tell from the angle but heres a few things I noticed You arent bracing your core before you squat. I can still see you breathing as you start the descent which means your core is not stabilized. Deep breath into the belly THEN descend. Again tough to tell but it looks like your toes are angled fairly wide and your knees may be caving in a bit. Id play with a slightly wider stance but reduce the angle of your foot placement. Ideally you want the knees to stay in line with your toes this can be tough depending on weaknesses and mobility.Someone with more experience in low bar may have more to add since I only utilize high bar and front squats.,xxfitness,culsliy,3,t5_2ryzy

4994145,0,t1_cunum2z,I would say that do what feels best for you. Dumbbells have the advantage that you use moredifferent stabilising muscles than with a barbell so it makes for a more varied workout additionally because each hand has a separate weight they minimise imbalances in your lifts and muscles. However when moving to a barbell you do have to relearn the lift a bit.

I wore hiking shoes and had excellent grip throughout and they were also well fitted and at no point got ripped off I saw a lot of other people lose shoes. I drank a protein shake about  minutes prior and it really gave me a boost. I left my hydration belt in my car so I was low on water but that helped with the energy. Have fun!

That way you can eat without counting but still have an idea about whether youre losing or gaining muscle and stuff like that.

5102183,0,t3_3kvpnn,It doesnt matter much if you do cardio before or after lifting as the fat burning effect of doing cardio after lifting is overrated.  However as youre looking to build lean muscle lifting first makes more sense as youll have more energy to devote to weight training.  Beyond that cardio before lifting can make you tired which could mean you get a little lazy while lifting and could injure something.  To me theres no real point to doing cardio before weight training as Id rather be fresh for weights.As far as how long after it depends on you.   minutes of weight training and  minutes of cardio  weight  cardio  hour weight  minutes cardio it doesnt matter too much.  You can do  minutes of weights  minutes of HIIT one day and then  minutes and  minutes of steady state the other day.As far as warming up  minutes of cardio of choice to get your core temperature up and then follow something like Youre doing plenty as it is so Id not do an extra day of pure cardio unless you really want it,xxfitness,cv1043g,24,t5_2ryzy

I dont know what program youre on but whatever it is you should lift a weight that you can do with good form and then move up progressively. I would question why the trainer pushed you to machines rather than helping you with what you were working on. Just a note dumbbell bench press can be pretty hard because each arm is having to work independently. If you use a barbell the arms can work together. Certainly nothing wrong with dumbbell work just something to keep in mind. Like I said I dont know what program youre on so perhaps its specific to dumbbells.,xxfitness,cv2c29e,2,t5_2ryzy

5241410,0,t1_cvhp9xm,Gaining strength does not necessarily mean gaining size or muscle mass  there are other things that happen to allow you to lift more weight.  With your activity level its to be expected that you arent getting bigger muscles at a significant calorie deficit.  Plus youve only been lifting for two months.Less fat can make your muscles appear bigger if they become more prominent and defined.  Even if you dont drop your fat percentage increasing your muscle mass can have a similar effect.  If your goals are to have bigger more visible muscles and you are new to lifting a bulk makes sense.  Do some googling on reverse dieting for tips on how to slowly increase your intake so you find a good balance of gaining weight and not hating changes in body composition if they come on too suddenly.  Take a look at progress posts at rbrogress and competitors who stay relatively lean  they all have to bulk at some point to grow the muscle they want to show off.,xxfitness,cvhs2yn,2,t5_2ryzy

Another difference between B and A is that the underwire if you have one if not just the bottom edge of the cup will be longer so it will go up higher on the side in the B and encapsulate the breast tissue better.

5576473,0,t3_3ricao,If you dont like Strong Lifts then by all means dont do it. But I think you are extremely mistaken to blame you problem in the specific lifting program you are following.Strong Lifts itself is not causing your stomach to change. In the beginning stages of ANY lifting program lifting leads to inflammation leads to water retention i.e. the stuffed sausage phase leads to  a slightly puffy appearance. Also although lifting weights can increase the size of your waiststomach by way of increased muscle mass you should still have a flat stomach and increased muscle mass is NOT going to result in love handles of any sort.Im sure youve heard the saying...abs are made in the kitchen. Keto is notorious for reducing bloatwater weight so logically going off keto it should not surprise you to see some of the water weightbloat coming back. Also according to another comment youre upping your daily calories by  calories which is good because kcal a day sounds like a dangerously low amount...which over the course of  weeks could result in slight weight gain depending on your metabolism and TDEE requirements.Anyways I guess my point is that you shouldnt be incriminating your lifting PROGRAM in all this. Strong Curves is not going to be any less prone to creating inflammation bloat and if you are having issues due to your diet a different lifting program is not going to solve them.,xxfitness,cwobalk,7,t5_2ryzy

I would always try to avoid talking to anyone in the gym. I have great friends and a fiancee and thats enough for me. No one else does what Im doing but honestly rather than hiding it I would talk to people about it if it interests you. I spent a long time not talking about the things Im good at and interested in and just adapting to what other people were interested in in conversation. Fuck that.

5597992,0,t3_3rsjyy,Are you using a full size plate  lbs? It looks like the starting position of the bar is too low. If you dont have access to bumper plates stack the weights on something other plates so that they approximate the height the bar would be at if you had  lb plates on there. That will help your starting position a lot. Also when you begin the pull you are just sort of jerking with your back and hips. Stabilize your shoulders and back by engaging your lats. Think of pulling your shoulders toward your hips shoulder blades in back pockets. This should get you real tight and should help with the back rounding. Try to keep your hips down and think more of bringing your butt forward towards the bar.,xxfitness,cwqzg2j,4,t5_2ryzy

5614081,0,t3_3s0dol,My husband and I went to a multi course fondue dinner and we split it . I literally wanted to just curl up and moan afterward I was so stuffed and uncomfortable. I dealt with it by  moving on and doing what I normally did the next day and  I dont have cheat meals any more because I usually felt sick afterwards. I have reverse dieted up to high enough macros that I dont feel like I need a cheat meal and I switched from regimented small meals to allowing myself to macro hoard a bit for my normal Friday half a pizza and my nightly ice cream bowl. I know la tee da good for me but I am beginning to think if I need a cheat meal that something was wrong with my eating structure. I do not track food on certain occasions but in my experience a cheat meal was just an excuse to binge and it was unpleasant. I dont restrict food anymore and I stay within my macros plus now that there is no restriction it isnt a problem and I can stop when Im full instead of taking the opportunity to shovel anything and everything that was normally off limits into my mouth. I dont mean to preach but cheat meals caused me a lot of stress and in hindsight I probably wont use them again when I cut. I will have untracked meals but I dont want binge experiences. I am pretty sure most of my cheat meals were  calories in one sitting and it was just too much food on that high end. ,xxfitness,cwszbqt,2,t5_2ryzy

5643335,0,t3_3sdyn9,As mentioned by people in this thread already  you burn calories just by being alive! If you imagine your body like an engine the food you supply to it is the fuel that constantly keeps you going and we measure the fuel going in in calories. Calories is literally the energy that is stored in food. You probably know the recommended daily amounts of calories etc men  women  etc. This is an estimation of calories OUT of your body so its like a break even amount you should be eating. But it is only an estimation and everyone is different based on activity levels amount of muscle and stature. SO if youre consuming more calories than your output the excess is stored as fat and when youre trying to LOSE weight you eat a calorie deficit  less than your bodys output to encourage your body to take energy from stored fat instead. If you want to maintain the weight youre at now you need to work out your own calorie outputinput based on your activity levels size etc. Its probably around  calories a day. ,xxfitness,cwwlz7b,1,t5_2ryzy

Youll never see those photos those photos will never impact on your life at all because you dont know those kids. It doesnt say anything about you it says something about them. It tells you that theyre pricks. Also you dont know that they were doing this so rather than letting insecurity take over choose to believe the alternative that they were taking photos of themselves. Your insecurity about how you look isnt a reflection of the truth. Your feelings arent a barometer of the truth so dont buy in to those feelings. Also if that woman came in and was annoyed with you for some unknown mad reason... so what? Thats her problem. You didnt do anything wrong. Again this is no reflection on you. Maybe she was distracted or tired or had had a really really bad day or is really anxious and prefers to use the changing rooms alone. Dont give too much time to these thoughts. If you start mulling them over tell yourself the preferable explanations and then distract yourself. Read a sign at the gym count back from  or start saying what youre looking at in your head. Ruminating is so bad for your mental health and doesnt get you anywhere.Go to the gym in SPITE of your worry. Do NOT let the lies going round in your head overtake you. Ignore other people in the gym because you dont matter to them either. Make a conscious mental note of positive experiences and neutral experiences at the gym. For example you go in one day and someone on reception is friendly or you go in one day and the whole thing is uneventful. It will help show you that these minor incidents are NOT a reflection of your experience at the gym as a whole.  I hope this helps! ,xxfitness,cwzv4g3,5,t5_2ryzy

I had the same thing happen to me only to find out the muscle in my left ham was shorter than my right. The only way to repair it is to stretch often Ham stretches and keep running. If you dont keep running the muscles wont adjust and youll continue to have the imbalance.Wait until the pain subsides stretch often and try again. Repeat until the pain goes away completely.,xxfitness,cxcwvvm,5,t5_2ryzy

At mine we take you on every machine that youer able to do and show you how to adjust it find your settings and starting weights and then draw up a sample workout plan based on your goals. The biggest thing to keep in mind here though is to make sure you like and trust the person thats guiding you some of the trainers will try to sell you on a package andor theyll force their own ideals on you so just be aware of that.

You probably wont need more than  minutes too per session. But if you are worried about losing weight dont. You wont burn that much to train for just a  at a moderate pace maybe only  calories maximum depending on your weight. Swimming adds mass too by the way since it is great resistance training even though its traditionally labeled as cardio.

5839189,0,t1_cxkynn6,Ok here goes. I had the advantage of a class with the ROTC department at my school where the teacher basically could do whatever the hell he wanted to achieve military fitness and it worked astonishingly well so I can give you some of the same workouts we used. If youre interested in the theory behind it as well I could send you some readings! But these are some general ideas   include swimming ruck marches and sprints as well as muscular endurance exercise.   balance complementary movements like pushing and pulling to avoid overtraining an imbalance or suffering overuse injuries.   do partial rangeofmovement exercises at greater difficulty than you could otherwise manage. This is lifts above RM pullups etc.   exercise in all conditions both fresh and tired.   scheduling theory to progress workouts should involve cyclic periods of stress and recovery. A good method is this  . test current ability   . build foundation strengthendurance lots of circuits and progressions  . focus on raw strength heavy lifting jumping etc.  . do more skill work sprints tactical movements if thats part of your training interval workouts  . combine strength work with skill work in highintensity workouts  . focus on endurance efforts long runs etc.  . unload with  weeks of lighter work  . retest your current ability then repeat the process.  You dont have to follow that to the letter by any means and it can be hard to create a workout plan for yourself but it may help give you a general idea.Now on to some actual workouts. Depending on your skill level these can feel harder at the beginning and if you cant finish thats fineI advise setting an allotted time like min and stopping after that. For what its worth your stats indicate youd have been better than average for starting out in this class. It will get easier. Ok hopefully the formatting doesnt crap out on this wall of text    pullups  pushups  squats bodyweight. Seems easy but repeat as many times as you can in  minutes. Count your rounds because youll probably improve a lot later on. If you cant do pullups I couldnt at this point do the angled ones I was talking about and do  instead. Picture to demo.    pullups  pushups  situps  squats.  minute rest.  rounds of this. This can be a killer and its basically designed to exhaust you. It should avoid injury though because youre balancing different kinds of movements pushing and pulling but stop if something hurts in a bad way. If you cant do full pullups do the angled ones but up it to  or . Then  situps. Then a short run loosen that body up!   Equipment circuits. These can vary and I advise just doing something you find fun. If you have kettlebells they work great for thiskettlebell swings clean and jerks box jumps and so on mixed with lunges sprints pushups...have some variety. Those boot camp classes at the YMCA do just fine. Ill make my next  bullet points circuit ideas    handstand pushups wall climbs or exercise band overhead presses whatever you can do.  box jumps.  burpeeweighted ball throws.  kettlebell swings.  pushups  situps.  rounds.   sprint  mile.  pushups  situps. do a pushup on a medicine ball then throw it as far as possible and repeat to cross  mile. buddy carry someone  mile. bear crawl  mile.    to   to .  burpees  handrelease pushup take your hands off the ground in the down position. Then  and  etc. until you do  burpee and  handrelease pushups.    burpee  mile. This is just suck. Its nothing fancy just a lot of training your mind to fight the suck.  burpees run  mile repeat  times.   buddy carries. If you can get a buddy to work out with you or just help you out find someone of an appropriate weight you can lift them but it gets exhausting after a bit and carry them for a little while. Then switch if theyre willing to work too! Switch off as necessary for  mile. If its just you stick to shorter distances.   ok fuck this workout seriously it hurts so bad. But its a good one.  squats  burpees  pullups whatever kind you can do. Then . Then . Then . Then . Then .    pullups  squats.  rounds. Then run  miles.   run  meters as many times as you can in  minutes. However long it takes you to run rest for half that time. Then max your pullups pushups and situps  minutes.   run  mile. Do  pullups for real I never got that far but you can mix it up and do the angled ones and jumping ones and use as many sets as you need  pushups and  squats in whatever combination you can. Run another mile.   breathing ladders. This is like  burpee take a breath  burpees take  breaths etc. This is a useful way to train your body to use oxygen efficiently. You can do it with all different movements and exercises.   Run  meters  times and  meters  times.   sprint workout do all your warmups and running form drills like high knees. Run out like  or  mile at what feels like  of max effort. Then walk back. Then . Then . Then . Then . Repeat  a few more times. Drop down to    rest. Thats it. The numbers can be arbitrary but the idea makes sense.  Honestly a lot of these are just endurance beatdowns. But if you pick something like this one day a week lift weights one day longer run one day and include some interval runs and equipment circuits you will absolutely increase your fitness and your PFT scores fast. For pullups there are several variations you could start with including the angled kind jumping pullups assisted pullups either with somebody holding your feet or with the machine and negatives. Throw them in wherever you need them. You will probably get at least  full pullup after a few months of this not to mention increasing your other scores as well. I would retest in  months and again in . But these are all just ideas! You dont have to follow this at all I hope some of it is useful to you nonetheless.,xxfitness,cxl1m6o,1,t5_2ryzy

I had an exboyfriend that yelled at me once in the gym for doing something wrong and I didnt try lifting again for  years so I am pretty sensitive about that.I also have a history of disordered eating and so sometimes my selfesteem gets low.

If later in the day I just try to coordinate my last meal with my workout so its well enough digested  hours before. I have issues with my joints and after trying a number of things my physio has me avoiding any quick movements like jumping to reduce risk of injury. If you are having big issues with your feet consider orthotics at least thats what my doc recommended. I wear a shape wear cami over my bra when working out just that little extra compression seems to help. Consider cycling or aquafit if running is an issue. Concentrate on breathing until you get used to doing it well learning to breathe is part of the progression yoga is a good way to learn breathing as it is a big part of it  its ok to be breathing hard but not ok if its hard to breathe. I did ok with paleo for weight loss I found limiting sugarcarbs but not letting myself get hungry to be more successful than any other diet Ive tried I would eat  cups veggies per day before letting myself have anything else primarily in soup so I was also particularly well hydrated which also helped reduce cravings I also drank only water or unsweetened herbal tea  after years of trying I think the only diet that will work is one where you dont feel deprivedhungry all the time and its going to be different for everyone  be mindful of what you are eating and why and you will figure it out.

I also steer clear of pasta and pizza because the servings are typically enormous and if anything Im ordering comes with a starch like bread or chipsfries as a side I ask them to hold it or replace with a side salad. Id go for something like chicken in tomato sauce delicious choice from a recent night out which turned out to be around  calories when I looked it up after or a steak or fish. When I went to a Jamie Oliver restaurant a while back I ordered a lamb dish which was about  calories many of the mains especially pasta dishes were  calories.

Like I would never gain weight and couldnt possibly know what she was talking about. It was this really weird moment for me because obviously I can could and do.

When using a smith machine I can do about .kg but I know I probably wont be able to bench the bar very well and Im scared of hurting myself. At what point should I attempt to bench the olympic bar?. The concept of front squats. How do I go about trying this? I can back squat kg x . for lbs at x  reps at the minute I know your front squat is meant to be lower but how much? Where should I rest the bar? Will it be uncomfortable due to having really prominent shoulder blades? Basically what the hell do I do?. Is it weird that my deadlift is way lower than my squat? Im a bit shit at them and can only do kg for x reps where my squat is at kg. Pretty much everyone Ive seen on here and on the normal fitness thread have a higher deadlift than a squat. I also feel like it should be a lot higher by now but Im a bit scared to try higher weights as it doesnt feel like I can do more.. I have some days where I can run km other days where I can barely run m without feeling knackered. Is it normal to have such weird fluctuating days? Not been on period for either so its not that..

I am doing my own take on ck on the treadmill and I am actually enjoying myself.

Have you tried recalculating your TDEE again? Your deficit is not probably your maintainence number or at least closer to it. This means it will be hard to see gains or losses as you are not eating enough for gains and too much for weight loss. It is also helpful to think of your lifting numbers reletive to body weight for instance if youre losing weight but your numbers arent dropping that means your power index is actually increasing.,xxfitness,cz4p2yn,1,t5_2ryzy

6296013,0,t3_41usvj,Your maintenance to stay at one weight will likely be different than that for another. However this is also affected by activity level. So if you are sedentary lb woman changing to being an active lb women may mean you end needing the same or even more calories. In addition your LBM will effect your calorie needs.Many people drop to unsustainable levels of body fat for competitions or engage in water manipulation tactics to make weight. This often means that they regain weight soon after the competition. Not all of the weight lost and gained is necessarily fat. Often water and food in the intestines makes up a fair bit. But also people often overeat after a period of restriction.Cutting weight whilst exercising hard can be exhausting and stressful. However it can be done in such a way that isnt necessarily bad for you. Actually specific kinds of exercise during a cut are beneficial  e.g. strength training whilst restricting calories helps to maintain strength and muscle mass. Also one persons  calorie deficit is not the same as anothers. If you require  calories to maintain your weight and cut to   youll find that much more manageable and its likely to be healthier in terms of having enough calories to meet micronutrient requirements for instance than someone who maintains at  cutting to .MASSIVE EDITSomeone just pointed out to me you mean eating  calories day.

Low carb diets have sometimes seemed to have shown benefit over other diets but I dont think Ive ever seen a study the proved an advantage that controlled protein intake. Extra protein may indeed have benefits for weight loss.Ketosis is beneficial for those who suffer from seizures. In addition keto and low carb diets can cause appetite supression and in particular  seem to be easy to adhere to among overweight individuals the very sedentary and those with poor blood sugar control. People who have good blood sugar regulation are less likely to see any benefits at all.Anyone who is serious about exercising and improving their performance in the gym may want to reconsider restricting carbohydrates and arbitrarily restricting their eating window. ,xxfitness,cz6nglu,2,t5_2ryzy

6319373,0,t3_423ypg,Not as often as I like honestly. I dont have any issues with eating it because even if I ate it as often as I like thats still a very minuscule amount that wouldnt affect my heatlth. As it is I probably only eat fast food a few times a year when Im traveling because it just doesnt fit into my normal lifestyle. If Im at work I never need to grab a quick lunch because I always pack it to save money. Making dinner is the same way. If Im running late for work a protein bar or a piece of toast is always going to be faster than grabbing fast food. Typically if I go out Im going to a party with lots of homemade food and goodies or to a nice restaurant. None of my friends will agree to get fast food because theyre perpetually dieting so even if they order the  calorie entree off a nice restaurant menu they wont agree to walk into a fast food restaurant because they have grand visions that when they go to the nice restaurant theyre going to order a salad or  and below calorie option. ,xxfitness,cz7xygb,2,t5_2ryzy

6333464,0,t3_42dra3,Your form on this one is pretty rough.Youre not going below parallel.  You gotta get way lower.Youre leaning too far forward the bar should stay over your midfoot.  Your quads are hurting because they are trying super hard to keep you from falling forward.  The path the bar takes should be perfectly vertical over your midfoot.  Watch the end of the barbell its going almost  degrees forward.Your knees and feet are way too close together.  Its going to hurt them and its preventing you from getting the depth you need.The form youve got going on right now will only work your quads and hurt your knees.  There is no significant glute or hamstring involvement.Youve also got the bar too high on your back.

There certainly can be advantages for it if youre very serious about sculpting your body or looking to rapidly gain muscle lose fat obtain peak performance in some area etc but its not necessary for everyone. Personally its not worth it for me my diet goals revolve around general health and fitness and essentially maintaining my current body. I tend to have sweets and junk food in moderation and feel best when Im eating reasonably balanced meals so there wouldnt be any huge advantages in counting exactly how many grams of protein Ive had today. Some people know theyre prone to say eating excess carbs and find that tracking macros is the best way to keep their diet on track.

The bar was so awkward I was really wobbly and I kept tripping out because the bar ends were in my peripheral vision and my brain kept telling me something was coming at me from the side. That peripheral thing was  times worse in a gym of mirror walls my first time was with only one mirror beside me. It was October th the day I picked up the barbell and squatted bar only  lbs . By December th I was squatting a plate  lbs for an easy  reps in squat and split squat. Now my squat working range is  lbs for  buuuut I still cant bench press worth shit. I put  lbs onto the bar  lbs total  and get whiny about it meanwhile I overhead press and Olympic lift well over lbs.

6467745,0,t3_447qtp,I have a rollercoaster relationship with food cravings. I know that my eating habits change when Im stressed and I try to work on that.Upfront disclaimer I am not a nutritionist I am not pregnant I have never been pregnant I do not have children I do not even pretend to know the nutritional needs of someone who is breastfeeding. That being said arent you essentially feeding yourself and the baby with the food youre eating? Maybe your bread cravings are related to the fact that there are nutrients you need in that bread. Or maybe youre not eating enough calories for the two of you.Theres nothing inherently wrong with carbs themselves... I understand that its pretty well documented that weight loss is mainly about calories. Im with you on the tracking calories using MFP I too got obsessive and was on the bingerestrict cycle. So I think a good general plan is to eat three meals a day and have an idea of what a portion size looks likes and stick to that at each meal. I think its mostly when I undereat that I get pretty uncontrollable cravings. I try not to get mad at myself or beat myself up about succumbing to the craving. I think that perpetuates the cycle of restrictbingerestrict. Its okay to eat some extra calories once in a while. You cant build Rome in a day you cant lose all the weight at once you cant change your entire lifestyle and eating habits at once. This is a longterm process and were committed to it longterm. I know that I can reach my goals if I stay focused and use my willpower to prevent the craving from turning into bingeing. Ill try to eat fruit instead grapes clementines raspberries whatever is in season or available. The reason I eat fruit is because it provides some sugar and energy to give a kick to my willpower. I also drink a lot of water because sometimes hunger  thirst. Over time my cravings have gotten less intense and Ive gotten better at dealing with them. I come to reddit frequently and get support by seeing other people experiencing the same kinds of things that I am. So thank you for sharing your experience and hopefully by sharing my experience back we are able to help each other succeed!,xxfitness,czob6xp,4,t5_2ryzy

6636166,0,t3_46jqok,Theres plenty of reasons why your weight might not have moved this week. Do you get on a scale once a week or track it everyday with an app or a spreadsheet? If its just once a week then it may just be natural fluctuations making it look like you havent lost anything.Secondly if youre building muscle through lifting then that may well offset any weight loss although you will have burned through fat as well which is great!. If you want to continue building muscle then the best way to measure your weightfat loss is through tape measurements of your body rather than scales. You will definitely notice a difference there  Im also trying to lose weight whilst lifting and building muscle and although on a scale alone it doesnt look like Ive lost much weight at all about lbs I know that Ive burned through waaaay more fat than that because Im lbs and my clothes already fit noticeably better. If I had truly lost only lbs of fat at my size it would NOT make that much difference to how my clothes fit!It is only one week and there are so many reasons why you may have stayed the same weight but whether continuing to lift weights is worth it for you is a personal choice and totally depends on your goals. Do you want to build muscle and strength and look toned? Then yes you should probably stick with the weights. Do you find it completely demotivating to see the weight loss slow down on a scale even if you know intellectually that some of that loss is being masked by muscle gain? If that makes you fall off the wagon then maybe not.For me its worth it because I personally enjoy weights work more than cardio and that has helped me stay on the exercise wagon. In a short time Ive seen a real increase in my strength and muscle mass I can feel muscle in my biceps without flexing! What is this madness!. And on top of that I am losing weight and visible inches. This works for me because my goal from the start was not just to lose weight but to get fit and strong so I dont mind that my scale goes down a little slower.Theres no real right or wrong here. You just have to work out what works for you and keeps you from giving up ,xxfitness,d05qinp,4,t5_2ryzy

It kind of helps me because I have to make all meals and snacks this ordeal where there is lots of variety and little things its fun. Plus having snacks makes me feel like a little kid again She also told me to learn how to properly fuel my body and make sure I am getting the variety and nutrients I need namely g protein per day as well as taking a multivitamin.

6682387,0,t1_d0ahss4,Hi! I am certainly not an expert but in order to give a better picture youd need to include a little more info. When youre not exercising are you sitting down all day desk job? Or are you on your feet? How long do you workout forwhat intensity level? Its taken me about a year to figure out my macros through guess and test and figuring out what my body responds too. When I got the FitBit Charge it really helped because I could see my actual calorie burn dailyweekly etc. so now I know im really on target but for example were the same height im also  but I weigh ish my macros for losing  lb a week are cals pfc my TDEE is around  on average. HOWEVER when I was in your shoes and still trying to get a handle on it a lot of calculators were telling me to eat between  to lose weight I was following that and not losing a pound. Online calculators assumed by my stats I work in a bank but I workout pretty hard so im sedentary but not that id only burn around cals a week but my FitBit has shown me I burn an average of about  a week. SO ANYWAY to get back to your question honestly depending on your goals its really hard to say without the extra info exactly what your caloric intake should be. ,xxfitness,d0aimwh,2,t5_2ryzy

I initially thought it was a marketing stunt a clickbait.I was honestly shocked that they did break up but a part of me was expecting it. I have been following Nikki B for a while and shes the only fit chick I follow or any celeb for that matter I follow on snapchat. Were the same age. I admired the fact that she legit busted her ass to get the success that she has. I was never drawn to CGs content. I just couldnt believe he was .. he looked a little old for his age. I kind of stopped watching after their content turned into vlogging. Too much flashy stuff always buying this moving there fancy cars. Not my style. Im here to watch workout videos. CG to me was too flashy. Not surprised that contributed to the break up. Anyway I feel for Nikki. I have been there.. several times. It takes a while to learn that loving someone does not mean that you dedicate your life to him or her. How crushing it is to hear your SO say that they are no longer in love with you...I give her mad respect for trying to stay positive during the video. I will continue following her.

And then my bf takes a slam shot at the ball puts some extra oomph into it to get his point which would be fine if I was facing the wall and waiting for his ball to rebound off it instead I was stupidly watching him from my position to the front and left of him. Had zero reaction to the rubber ball flying at my face at  mph. It smacked me squarely on the chin. The sting was so sudden and painful that despite my best efforts to appear lighthearted about the whole thing tears welled up in my eyes immediately. Through my blurry tears I see my bfs face which transforms from confusion to shock to alarm to concern to guilt. Which despite my  tears I find hysterically funny. So Im standing in the middle of the court waffling between bouts of outright sobbing and laughing so hard Im doubledover. I could not compose myself. Crying laughing crying laughing... for minutes. The worst part is the court has three solid walls and then a glass wall with a door that closes but there is a second floor catwalk over it which is pretty open and means you can hear the court pretty well from other areas of the gym. My bf said my initial shreak of pain sounded like when he accidentally rolled his computer chair over our dogs paw.

BUT imo that kind of impact can put people at higher injury risk and isnt worth it unless theyre coached etc.They found that cycling esp shorter less frequent periods of higher intensities did less for fat than running but doesnt interfere with muscle . It can be a fat burner too thoughMaybe do a couple of HIIT bike sessions a week? And some short  min moderate  max heart rate sessions right after lifting?

I do my back squats as a touch n go with a stool. Well sometimes I dont quite touch but I know Im deep enough. This forces me to push my butt back and also to go deep enough.There is actually a name for this and its called box squats. Try them at home and with just a broomstick. Hit all your form cues. Shoulder blades tight. Chest up. Hinge at the knees and the hips at the same time. REACH with your butt. Tight in your core. Sit down. Stand up again hinging properly from your hips and knees.

6956082,0,t3_4aww21,Look at it like this  what have you learned derails your progress?  Do you go overboard on the dieting and set yourself up for bingeing?  Do you get bored with your workouts and stop doing them?  Are you expecting to see dramatic results in a short frame of time and get discourage when you dont?  You have to set yourself up for success.  For example I had trouble dieting because I had no clear plan other than eating clean!  Since I failed to plan what I was going to eat I kept ending up in situations where all that was available to eat was a bag of Doritos.  The solution was to figure up my calories plan out my meals and spend an hour or two prepping them so I could easily grab healthy meals and snacks.Likewise I found that I do best if I workout early in the morning.  If I plan to exercise later in the day I always get derailed by life.  So my default exercise time is the early morning.  That way no matter what happens I got my workout out of the way.  I also like to combine socializing and exercise so I have a group that I mountain bike with.  I barely ever miss a group ride for fear they might have fun without me and I had to push myself to keep up with them because they were all faster than me.  I dont even count it as exercise because its fun  lbs. is not a huge amount to lose but you wont lose it overnight.  If you lose  lbs. per week which is not that hard to do it will take you about  months.  Plan a little minireward for yourself if you want  after you lose  lbs buy a cute new outfit or get a pedicure or something.  It is a marathon not a sprint.  Small sustainable changes are more effective longterm than going all out on some insane dietexercise plan and then giving up after three weeks.  ,xxfitness,d14t0eh,1,t5_2ryzy

Eating disorders are complicated and have many many contributing factors but why start them off with a concept that some foods are bad?

I was torn because I personally feel that half marathons and marathons should be run and if you cant run them then you shouldnt do them...like the poster above me said it feels like a matter of respect and if you arent training to run them then whats the point of participating in a running event? But then at the same time who am I to tell you not to walk the race if thats what you want to do? AranaSF does make great points though and if you are dead set on walking the half marathon a full really is not sane safe or plausible then you should at least check the cut off time first. ,xxfitness,d1iw6xb,7,t5_2ryzy

7093032,0,t1_d1jo02p,I completely understand all of that. I hate that shorter people in general need fewer calories than taller people. It puts us in a difficult place and its really hard to tiptoe that line. I find it most difficult when Im eating  or lower so if that spot for you is just under  then please dont go lower and risk a potential ED! I generally put the TDEE calculators to sedentary and light exercise just to overcompensate so theres definitely a chance that mine is higher than Im leading myself to believe. Youve just gotta find that sweet spot that works for you and it sounds like the intense workouts and higher calories are working for you. If you do decide to try PHUL you can modify it to fit your needs for instance I dont always do MT rest THF if its a hectic week I might do  of the workouts and then continue the cycle the next week on day  on Monday.

If you take a diet break and still arent losing weight on  after restarting it seems increasing exercise or eating less would be the unfortunate solution. If youre referring to reverse dieting thats more used to minimize body fat gain after being in an extended large deficit.

Your point about how satisfying it feels to lift is spot on but the barrier to entry is a lot tougher for lifting than it is for cardio  especially for women who are less likely to have learned to lift as teens.

Sometimes you can find singleserving packets of protein powders as a togo style packet and those cost just a couple dollars. That might be a way to try some things.  I dont have too much experience with plant proteins but my little experience has shown the texture and taste can be notsogreat compared to whey so you might need more than just water or milk for mixing banana usually helps everything. I find them usually a little grittier less fluffy and sweet.  Maybe you could mix another kind of protein in with your whey perhaps just having less of it might help.  Also greek yogurt  fat is super lean easy to eat high protein but if the dairywhey is whats bothering you then it might still trigger things.,xxfitness,d294f15,2,t5_2ryzy

7345091,0,t3_4fxz1x,Not entirely fitness related aside from being strong enough to accomplish this story but its a very physical blunder.I work in housing. My current job is on the building side I started in the financing side I really didnt mean to get into this industry but I actually really like it! Anyways. Its a really nice blend between officeclerical work and running around dealing with shipments and clients. Sometimes our clients we technically only work with builders and their contractors bring or send in their customers so they can do things like pick out their specific slabsinkwhatever.The other day I was helping one of said customers. Super sweet couple came in to verify what their sink looked like installed to see if they wanted to upgrade. Easy enough. Now the way our showroom sink displays are set up  of them are in drawers. All of them are installed on a minicounter made of granite or marble just big enough to give people an idea of what full installation looks like.As it happens the sink they needed to see was one of the majority that are in a drawer. When I went to pull it out it got jammed which should have clued me into the fact that this granite wasnt properly installed on the drawer spoiler alert it didnt. What does my collegeeducated functioning adult brain decide is a great idea? Why reaching under said granite to pull the drawer out the rest of the way. Which I successfully did! However in the process of successfully pulling out the drawer I managed to lift up the minigranite countertop and then proceeded to drop it back into the drawer. Unfortunately the tip of of my middle finger happened to be between the two during the drop.Now this really isnt a giant rock but even a tiny amount of granite attached to a sink really freaking hurts a whole bunch when it lands on your finger. I managed to hold it together besides tearing up a bit I didnt cry but I also definitely got watery eyes immediately and very much wanted to cry but the poor couple was mortified! They asked like  times if I was sure I was okay and I was like really it hurts but its not that bad Im okay I promise.It still kind of hurts but its shockingly not swollen. And they upgraded! Because even injured by God I can sell. and they probably felt guilty but hey it really did hurt! Entirely my fault in no way theirs but still. Ill take the mini win out of it,xxfitness,d2d33yb,14,t5_2ryzy

7365949,0,t3_4g832q,Ive been doing keto for  days and have lost  pounds. Personally I love it. I have shitty snacking habits and its helped to curb that. Its also gotten me to eat a lot more homecoookes meals veggies and healthy fats and much less processed crap.  Plus Im able to do IF because I stay fuller so much longer and its nice not to worry about food. Ive also been lifting the entire time and can tell that I might have likely lost more if I was dieting and not exercising. My husband has been doing keto for about  months and has lost  pounds with zero exercise. As far as how it affects my workouts I dont notice any big difference but I was staring at a fairly beginning level and I hate cardio so I dont mind doing that less. Anyway I think that there are a lot of negative views about keto and I also see a lot of people praising it like the second coming of Christ. Im more likely to land somewhere in the middle I definitely dont think its unhealthy or leads to unhealthy behavior for all people. But I also think that people have a view that you can eat piles of bacon and butter and hope to lose weight. I still have to religiously track my macros sometimes meals are more challenging to make but for me its made a huge difference in my mental and physical health and Im happy with it. Side note it did eliminate my need to take heartburn medicine daily help my anxiety and sleeping issues and my cholesterollipid panels all came back clean.

The benefit of doing it on days youre not lifting is that youre spacing it out a bit more and for some people doing cardio helps to recover from lifting. Or they just find it easier to split up.

7525638,0,t3_4if6f2,So I agree that your protein intake is low but your fat intake is also borderline scary low. Aside from tbsp of almond butter in the morning I dont see any! Youre living on almost all carbs. Youre making good carb choices lots of fiber and veggies and legumes! but you definitely need to add in more fats and protein. They will help keep you full while cutting but beyond that your body needs adequate fat and protein intake to recover from all the exercise. You can totally up your fat and protein with plantbased sources if thats your jam.An easy addition to your morning oatmeal would be some hemp hearts theyre higher protein than the almond butter. You can also get flavored vegan protein powder and mix it inI dont currently use any but I have in the past. Pea protein seems to be the standard. If you dont want to eat any protein powder thats fine too its not for everyone. For snacks you could try switching out a piece of fruit for something like Greek yogurt or a rice cake with nut butter or avocado. ETA I forgot about granola. Carbs with a big dose of fat. You can get organiclowersugar brands with decent macro profiles or make your own!Its fine to cut some rice at lunch but add some avocado seeds olive oil coconut oil etc. Eliminating carrots is pointless but you could cut your potato serving in half and add some fat like butter cheese or another plantbased source. You should also consider a protein source as your main dish like tofu seitan a mushroom burger fish etc. These are all just ideas and stem from changes that have worked for me personally. I threw a lot of options at you dont feel obligated to do all of them. Go slow. Dont try to overhaul your diet completely overnight. I agree that avoiding strict countingtracking is paramount if youve struggled with disordered eating. But there are definitely deficiencies in your diet that need to be addressed so try to look at it as finding the best fuel for you not necessarily restricting yourself. Youre already making healthy choices you just need to balance things out a little better. I cant say that upping your fat  protein intake will help you lose lbswithout a body fat  its hard to know if you even need to lose lbsbut getting good nutrition is important whether youre cutting or not. You also might benefit from seeing a dietician who specializes in helping athletes. At your sizestature Im guessing youre probably a very competitive runner. ,xxfitness,d2xmlx4,6,t5_2ryzy

7557186,0,t3_4it4i6,Good for you! I went from BMI . to . and for a lot of it my main exercise was exactly what youre doing. I am into more intense activities now but I still try to get a  minute walk on my lunch break  days a week. I thought Id share some thoughts with you that helped me There are  hours in a day and I only need half of one. Seriously how many hours in the day do we spend vegged out in front of the TV or Reddit or whatever? When I exercise I generally know exactly how many minutes Im going to spend doing it. What if I applied that to other activities? So like if I sit down to do some redditing sometimes I will actually set a timer. In the grand scheme of a day a half hour walk is something we should almost always be able to find time for with obvious exceptions for extreme weather or personal emergencies.  The first five minutes always suck. Ive heard this called false fatigue. Basically Im totally paraphrasing and might be getting details wrong when you start to exert your body it goes wait a minute wtf ow! and sends signals of pain and fatigue to you. Your brain compensates by releasing endorphins but theres a bit of a time lag so I think we sometimes have a tendency to anticipate what exercise is going to feel like based on that first  minutes. But anyway when I start exercising and my thoughts turn to this sucks this hurts I dont wanna I consciously remind myself the first  minutes always suck.Also you might consider getting a fitness tracker like a Fitbit. For me seeing that little ticket climb with the number of steps I am getting encourages me. It also suggests how to tweak my calories higher or lower based on my activity for the day. Its a great motivator for me to get my body moving!!!Great job! Keep it up!!!,xxfitness,d317rre,7,t5_2ryzy

Depending on how farfast you run you may exhaust your muscles before you start lifting and then your lifting form might not be as good as it should be and you can injure yourself. Lifting first makes it so your form is correct since you have the energy and still leaves you with enough energy to run after without injuring yourself. You can run first and lift second if you can maintain your form. Most people Ive talked to have trouble with that though so I usually try to lift first or give my body a couple hours to recover postrun,xxfitness,d3dzsro,1,t5_2ryzy

Then when  minutes is up drink a ton of water and peeYou can repeat this if you want but I have found that  or  times stops a UTI in its tracks. If you have a raging UTI then do it every  hours for a bit. You could also use it preventitavely such as after sex or before you go to sleep for example.DMannose works by binding to ecoli in your bladder. UTIs happen when the ecoli sticks to the walls of you bladder  so anything you can do to keep the eColi moving along and out is good. Cranberry has the effect of making the walls slippery and harder for ecoli to stick to. Then you pee all of it out the ecoli and the dmannose. ecoli is the cause of most UTIs but occasionally it can be something else.You can buy it on Amazon for cheap but if you cant wait I got mine once at Whole Foods for way more . You might also find it at a local vitamin type store. Definitely get the powder form  the capsules are good for travel but I feel less effective.No side effects for me. My understanding is your body does not absorb dmannose. Its been a great over the counter alternative to antibiotics which mess up my gut flora BCPs effectiveness etc.Of course if this doesnt work quickly or you have more severe symtoms such as a fever definitely go to a doctor. On a side note there were some studies or urban legends a few years back that chicken is a major contributor to UTIs. I cut down on chicken as well as occasionally taking dmannose preventatively after sex and have not had any UTIs for about a year,xxfitness,d4mn06w,3,t5_2ryzy

8083884,0,t1_d4oloiy,There are two and only two process you can employ to change your physique changing your fat mass and changing your muscle mass. Changing your muscle mass is targeted  the muscles you work get bigger hypertrophy and the muscles you dont use get smaller atrophy. Changing your fat mass is not targeted  when you are at a caloric deficit you will gradually lose fat from all over your body as your genetic fat storage determines and vice versa for a surplus.Putting this all together you have two mechanisms for making an area on your body smaller. . Stop using the muscle there and let it atrophy . lose weight from all over including that area. Exercise can only make something smaller when it makes everything smaller by losing weight andor improving your overall body composition. If you have been doing a lot of oblique work stop doing that and the muscles on your sides will atrophy and shrink. If you naturally have a straighter figure working your legs and glutes  shoulders and lats can give you a more pronounced waist.,xxfitness,d4opb5i,15,t5_2ryzy

8098074,0,t3_4pxn44,My waist is  bigger than it used to be  and since I got so much leaner I lost fat from my hips so I am definitely not an hourglass at all these days  .  I am pretty lean through the midsection and since I can see my obliques pretty clearly I tend to think it is muscle not fat.  Granted I wasnt superhourglassy before either  and since I have very narrow hip bones when I lost fat from my hips my figure went from slightlycurvy to totallynotcurvy.  If I was going for more aesthetic goals I would probably stop working my obliques  but since my main goals pertain to my sport mountain biking having really strong core amp obliques is a good thing so I have just accepted my rather boyish figure.

8261482,0,t1_d5a7a3t,The possiblility that calcium deposits is coming from calcium supplements is only a concern for people with advanced kidney disease  One possible explanation for a link the JAMA researchers said is that a bolus of calcium that enters the blood stream through a supplement but not gradually through dietary sources can result in calcium deposits in arteries. Indeed this is a known complication among patients with advanced kidney disease who take calcium supplements.  And even then its still inconclusive. So unless you have advanced stage kidney disease its not really worth worrying about. And there are SOOOO many studies on both sides of the fence on whether or not dietary supplements of calcium are helpful for preventing osteoporosis. But the fact that theres an overwhelming amount of studies showing that yes they help Im gonna keep going with it. And my own experience is more than enough proof to me that I have to take some form of supplemental calcium because unless I consume a lot of dairy I dont come close to getting enough through food aloneas you said its very hard to do this without overeating or just eating a ton of dairy. If you dont get enough calcium your blood calcium levels get too low and your body fixes this by taking calcium out of your bones parathyroid hormone plays a role here to get your blood calcium levels back to where they should be. This results in lowered bone density and increased risk for fracture. When your blood calcium levels are higher than they need to be the extra calcium gets deposited in the bone matrix thereby increasing bone density good! B vitamins are pretty common in fruits and veggies and many other foods  so as long as you arent eating all processed crap youre probably getting enough b vitamins unless you exhibit signs of anemia but getting more iron doesnt actually helptheres a few types of anemia that are actually due to B vitamin deficiencies Again taking a simple multi vitamin pretty much solves all of thisthere are no health risks for the general population by taking a daily multi vitamin. If you have health problemsare managing a disease or even taking a prescription its worth discussing with your doctor or pharmacist if there are any concerns you should have. For example you dont want to be taking vitamin C supplements if you are taking Warfarin blood thinner. If you take Yaz you dont want to take supplemental Potassium you will be at risk for hyperkalemia although its not terribly common but its not going to hurt you if you eat a banana daily. Just dont take a mutli vite that has potassium. Fortunately this isnt a problem for a lot of meds especially common stuff like many antibiotics. If you take Accutane isotrentinoin you should not consume a significant amount of supplemental vitamin A ie its usually fine in a multi vite since its not a high amount but you would not want to take a separate vitamin A supp that would be much more potent My point is stay away from places like the NY times for learning about vitamins. Talk to your pharmacist or primary care doc. If you take any prescription medication discuss this with them. If you dont most likely you have nothing to worry about and are not at risk for taking a daily multi vitamin. You have more to gain than to lose.,xxfitness,d5a8rre,2,t5_2ryzy

8303152,0,t3_4t1fa0,When I found a routine that suited me. At my current level I like a fullbody routine with supersets that doesnt take more than about an hour.I started going to the gym a couple years ago and tried spin class then Strong Lifts then a bad personal trainer at the gym then a reputable personal trainer at a studio. Spin class eventually made my knees hurt Strong Lifts was too advanced for me at the time the bad personal trainer put me on a bunch of random machines instead of the free weights that Id asked to do and the other trainers routine was too long and complicated.,xxfitness,d5fg9ne,2,t5_2ryzy
8303653,0,t3_4t708q,Taking a branched chain amino acid supplement was a lifesaver for me when I first started serious leg day workouts. I like MusclePharm Amino which also contains electrolytes and magnesium. gtData show that BCAA supplementation before and after exercise has beneficial effects for decreasing exerciseinduced muscle damage and promoting muscleprotein synthesis. Muscle damage develops delayed onset muscle soreness a syndrome that occurs  h after intensive physical activity that can inhibit athletic performance. Other recent works indicate that BCAA supplementation recovers peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation in response to mitogens after a long distance intense exercise as well as plasma glutamine concentration. The BCAA also modifies the pattern of exerciserelated cytokine production leading to a diversion of the lymphocyte immune response towards a Th type. According to these findings it is possible to consider the BCAA as a useful supplement for muscle recovery and immune regulation for sports events. ,xxfitness,d5fiih5,0,t5_2ryzy

In this case sprints. I felt different for a day or so afterward and the weight has been coming off steadily. I also just bought a parachute to run with kinda excited to use that. My understanding is that HIIT can be a boost for your metabolism throughout the day which will start to slow down as you maintain a caloric deficit which tends to cause these plateaus.Only issues with HIIT is that it kinda beats my body up to spring that much gotta be careful about my knees back etc. and mentally its difficult.

8350803,0,t3_4tuku1,I think you should try to make things easy for yourself for the moment. Because I think you need a lot of wins right now  So with that in mind Im going to suggest not going for a very aggressive deficit atm. Go for a smallish deficit that you are going to have better odds of sticking to. Aggressive deficits are hard enough for a lot of people even harder if youre already not feeling great. You will still get results. But the process will be and feel more manageable. Suppressing hunger which youd have to do a lot of if you went with say a target of  would take up a lot of cognitive and emotional resources and you need to do well in school right now thats important too. And if you gave yourself a hard target and had a bad day Id worry that you might be too hard on yourself maybe blame yourself too much and that that might feel defeating. A conservative deficit is how I did it btw nothing wrong with that approach for anyone. I would keep things really simple at this point. Plan for  days at a time. Just cook extra when you make something enough leftovers for another meal. Invest in tupperware for thatAlso have some frozen stuff that fits your targets and is ready to go for times cooking seems like too much. Similarly scope out a few targetfriendly fast food meals for emergency backup in advance. ,xxfitness,d5lejco,2,t5_2ryzy

8401163,0,t3_4uo2we,I am new to working out.  I started Strong Curves last week and went  times.  I wanted to go  times but I was too sore.  Anyway I did workouts ABA didnt get to C.  So I decided to do C yesterday so that I could get it in right away this week.  Anyway I did a set of RKC planks  seconds and wasnt able to activate my glutes so I did a second set for about  seconds still never got the glutes to activate but got a good ab workout.Later in the day before bed I decided to do the Reaching Singleleg Romanian Deadlift exercise from program C I skipped it at the gym because I couldnt balance enough to not embarrass myself.  About  minutes after I got done I got really bad stomach and lower back cramps that lasted for probably an hour until I could calm down enough to go to sleep.  Im a fairly anxious person asis and I cant tell if I was overreacting but I started googling ectopic pregnancies and stuff because I NEVER get periodlike cramps unless I actually have my period or like  or  days before.  My period got done almost  weeks ago and I am on BC AND if its relevant I had a normal pelvic exam and pap smear at the end of April this year.I am thinking about going to the doctor because I have some bloating today the cramps are gone but I honestly wanted to check with you guys and see if this is something normal and I just dont know about it or if I truly need to worry.  My boyfriend thought I might have pulled a muscle or just overly exhausted some back and ab muscles and said it was probably nothing to worry about.

8631237,0,t1_d6khm2y,Thanks so much for the reply!  Great to hear heavy lifting has helped you.  Question  do you deadlift?  I really want to deadlift but Im too scared itll hurt my back.  So running used to make my back feel better actually any form of exercisemovement helped but I recently got a cortisone shot that seems to have made everything worse and now physical activity can irritate it...I reallyyyy hope this problem goes away.  My biggest problem is that sitting is the absolute most aggravating thing for my back but as a student I have to sit down day in and day out in lecture and to study and do homework.  Im really at a loss at how to avoid sitting as much except for looking into getting a standing desk.  For now Im hoping that getting stronger and more flexible especially in my core and hipshamstrings the suggested areas to focus on by my physical therapist will help me sit with better posture.,xxfitness,d6kie57,1,t5_2ryzy

Im a dancer so Im pretty good at falling without hurting myself but I had a pretty nasty bruise on my hip and the wind knocked out of me for a few minutes.

Drinking sour cherry juice after a workout can also help because it has lots of potassium etc.Also no matter how much it hurts the next day make sure you at least do some gentle walking.

8763645,0,t1_d70rh2b,I started with a gynecologist that was recommended to me by a friend. As I had to wait a month for the appointment yay new patient bias I took the opportunity to log my symptomsmood for the month. I started with an overview of my perception while my brain was still functioning in the good week. Then I tracked every physical and emotional symptom as they came up so not quite daily but sometimes twice in a day. It is by far the scariest thing I have ever written not only because of the negative thoughts but by how convinced I would become that I was lying to myself and this was all a ploy for attention. I thought so many times about deleting the whole thing. I was terrified that if I gave it to the doctor Id be involuntarily committed to the psych ward. I even cleared my weekend just in case. Once it became apparent that my issues began at ovulation the goal was to stop ovulation and thats why the doctor chose depoprovera. She gave me the Prozac as well but recommended I see a psychiatrist to consult on that treatment and get refills. For the psychiatrist I had a friend seeing a therapist and she asked her therapist to recommend someone.There are horror stories about depo all over the internet but as I said Ive been lucky. I skipped my first two periods and only had like one day of explosive PMSlike rage and some spotting when it was starting to wear off. I was a weeping wreck the day of the next shot but once the second injection came I was better pretty much over night and dropped the  pounds Id gained. If I ever change birth controls I would still need something that stops ovulation not just regulates the timing of it. With the Prozac Im not sure how long it actually took to work because I started taking it on that one good week when I expected my mood to be stable anyway. Within  hours I reverted back to the morning person Id been until my mids. I wake up naturally at am without an alarm. I have so much energy I joined a gym and I go  days a week. I was sedentary before that. Now I have muscles. I havent had a suicidal thought since. Im still getting used to having moods again. As winter is approaching Im curious to see if seasonal depression compounds the issues so I have a checkin with the psychiatrist in the queue. Its sometimes difficult to get past that daily pill for mental health stigma but I remind myself you wouldnt deny a diabetic insulin. Clearly my brain chemistry cannot regulate itself and needs outside help.As I said I was lucky with medications and I havent tried out other combinations. When I saw the gynecologist she wanted to start me on Prozac first and wait a month before doing anything with birth control. I begged and pleaded and refused to leave until something was done about my period. For me it was the bigger issue because I knew I could cope the rest of the time if I wasnt having cramps and period depression. I was tired of missing work days because I couldnt get out of bed. After seeing what Id written down about the last cycle I couldnt lie to myself anymore and I did not want to face another period. Since youre off medication now Id encourage you to track your symptoms. I did it in google docs so I could add to it anywhere. It really helps you to go to the doctor with notes in hand and it helps to know you arent blowing things out of proportion when you really do have those PMDD moments. Sometimes Id just write a sentence other times a cathartic diatribe. Its always possible that something in the log will help your doctor figure out a better way to help.,xxfitness,d71483z,2,t5_2ryzy

8799989,0,t3_50nroj,I took up running in high school and it sounds like I was in a similar boat to you. My family wasnt super healthy and had lots of general health problems that I was worried about inheriting and I never felt athletic. I sucked at sports and just generally didnt feel comfortable with myself. So one day I ran around the block and the next day I did it again. I kept on running each day and every day I would try to run a little bit farther than I did the day before. At the time I didnt worry about speed just distance. Your biggest enemy right now is worrying. And I know its super easy to say just dont worry but you really shouldnt. Go run and remember that every time someone in your family says something to you youre the one that just pushed yourself to the limit to make your life better and it takes zero effort or skill to say pretty much anything from a couch.Little brothers can be extremely annoying. But it might be good to reframe your way of thinking. If your family is that unhealthy youre setting an example for him by trying to break that cycle and it doesnt seem like a big deal now but it really does make a difference. Just seeing someone in your family out exercising will normalize that for him and make it less likely that he will follow in your parents footsteps. Thats a big deal.My final part of my lecture sorry is just to stick with it. It has taken me forever to get used to thinking about longterm results when I exercise. Running well isnt something that happens in a week or  weeks. Just do whatever you can do everyday. Download CK or tell yourself that today Im going to run for  minutes. Tomorrow Im going to run for  minutes. Then  minutes the next day. In two months youll easily bang out an hour long run and youll feel like a badass.,xxfitness,d75n0df,8,t5_2ryzy

8894682,0,t1_d7gxkit,So this is what Im seeing ulagostimOn the left shes very pancaked as she comes out of the hole and then on the right you can see shes almost completely finished with her knee extension but her hip extension has hardly changed at all. The position on the right is not one you want to be in because shes put her lower back in position to be both the prime mover and primary limiting factor in her squat. Her squat will fail when her lower back and glutes arent strong enough to lever the bar up from this awkward good morning position.  The glutes can and should help but the quads should be the prime movers in a squat. These pictures say quad weakness to me. I dont think shes employing this as a technique to recruit her glutes more I think shes falling into this because her quads arent strong enough as per Greg Nuckols I could be wrong though!Would be interesting to see an angle from the back as well I always like to see peoples stance width toe angle and ankle positioning.,xxfitness,d7h0icg,3,t5_2ryzy

9011653,0,t1_d7usgxk,I am the preworkout master so prepare to get taken for a spiritual journey of infinite knowledge.Concoct your own preworkout. The only ingredients that you should actually take preworkout are lcitrulline malate  grams and caffeine uhh...between  mg and  mg lol. Lcitrulline malate most notably increases bloodflow which your muscles love and reduces fatigue. Im sure youre well aware of caffeines benefits so I wont mention the more common ones. One interesting benefit of caffeine is acute increases in strength in doses equal to or exceeding  mg. I dont believe anything over  mg is necessary which is why I ended the earlier provided range at  since caffeine pillscapsules commonly come dosed in increments of  mg and you probably wont be cutting your capsule open to split the powder in half. However doses as low as  mg or maybe less are effective so depending on your tolerance and your goals you may want to shoot for as low of a dose as you can or maybe you want to entirely avoid caffeine for some lifts. Basically the dosing with caffeine is relatively specific to the individual taking the caffeine. To answer a question of yours though I absolutely avoid any caffeine intake that isnt directly preceding a workout so as to avoid become further tolerant todependent on the substance. Caffeine is the only ingredient that Ill list here that you may not want to take every workout but I take it every workout soooo again personal preference reigns supreme. Experiment sensibly with stimulatory compounds like caffeine.Two other common compounds are beta alanine  grams and creatine  grams. Both of these can be taken during the day at any point and theyll still positively affect your workouts after accumulating in your body. Creatine is commonly dosed at  grams but you dont need that much. Because its so cheap and safe though  grams is recommended for the sake of simplicity. Beta alanine is also incredibly safe so Id go with  grams as available products commonly having doses of  . or  grams per serving. Creatine has so many benefits that Im simply gonna encourage you to look it up on examine.com. Everyone should be taking it. Period. Beta alanine generally increases endurance so to speak. Its probably the least noticeable of the supplements that Ive recommend so far but its still a useful safe supplement.Also drinking simple sugars before and during a workout is proven to improve exerciseperformance.  grams of sugars is sufficient although this can be skipped if youre opposed to such a sugarintake.If you have any questions about these supplements or any other supplements check out examine.com. Phenomenal seemingly unbiased resource.If buying these ingredients in bulk sounds like too much of a hassle for you you can look for a premade product that includes these ingredients but youll likely have a hard time finding a product that has everything here in the proper doses that they best work at. If you do buy the ingredients in bulk Bulk Supplements Optimum Nutrition Now Sports and Nutricost are some favorite companies of mine that conveniently sell their shit on Amazon. If you wish to buy a premade product Pulse by Legion Athletics is phenomenal but doesnt include creatine. Also because you need to take beta alanine every day but you may not want the caffeine every day you may end up buying beta alanine separately regardless...and then at that point you may as well buy the other ingredients in isolation as well.Lol dont worry about thermogenics and shit. Caffeine and ephedrine or its baby brother synephrine are the only legal compounds that potentially partly work via this mechanism but its a small effect and diet is the key ingredient to weightloss. Thermogenics wont burn fat if youre in a caloric surplus. God damn that was comprehensive. Good luck out there champ.,xxfitness,d7v26g1,12,t5_2ryzy

9055685,0,t3_54alb7,You are a little high on your squat. The crease of your hip should be at or below the top of your knee. It looks like you are maybe an inch or two high. For leaning too far forward try to drop your butt between your legs versus pushing backwards. You might want to try googling fixing forward leaning squat or fixing good morning squat. I have both these problems . Ive done a lot of squat variations like front squat pause squat and Zercher squats to help with this. But I think the biggest improvement has come from increasing my hip mobility. Im  yo and I have a desk job so I am not the most flexible person. I started with flossing my hips which is a real thing but lately what weve been doing in my gym is using something like this to dig into the hip and loosen up the fascia. It hurts like heck but has allowed me to hit depth much more easily. Some people suggest raising your heels either with a plate or squat shoes.

9142199,0,t3_55ghz5, Take all advice on reddit as a grain of salt. If you cant find supporting evidence to the advice apply it cautiously. Ive gotten shitty advice here and on the fitness subreddit. Research advice given in articles too. Theres shitty advice there as well. Hell research my advice!  Dont require motivation to get you to the gym. Its not an option that requires motivation to do. Make it something you have to do much like brushing your own teeth! Find something at the gym you like to do. I like powerlifting and cycling. If you told me I needed to do olympic lifting and running I would be very frustrated at the gym and not want to go. If you can find a gym buddy that will meet you at the gym that will GREATLY impact your ability to stick to the gym. I go with my SO and his mom and we are more consistent because we feel bad if we skip and dont lift together. But make sure your gym buddy is serious about going to the gym regularly! Fitness classes are super fun if you get bored of regular cardio! Dont obsess over calories or macros. I dont care what anyone says Ive lost my first lbs by halfassing my macro and calorie counting. Not everyone has to eat like a bikini competitor and weigh their prepackaged yogurt to make sure its correct in order to lose weight. TDEE calculators are kind of garbage. Use this spreadsheet to accurately estimate your TDEE over time.  If you dont have a personal journal I would get one if you have issues with emotional eating. Selfreflection paves the way to changing bad habits. Give yourself praise for choosing to eat something healthy or sticking to a gym schedule! Even the little things deserve praise.

9199269,0,t3_56a8fl,As far as weight loss goes the FAQ is pretty right. You lose weight in the kitchen. Exercising might feel like youre doing more but the calories burned are pretty much a drop in the bucket. And for people that dont track food closely often times adding exercise results in people eating more so it negates the calorie burning effect. But as you recognize being healthy is about more than weight alone. So working out for being healthy I think you want to hit your muscles and hit your heart. Resistance training increases strength bone density helps you maintain or increase lean muscle mass and reduces your risk of injury. If you dont have equipment the chart that usambeano posted looks great or check out rbodyweightfitness. Cardio on the other hand strengthens your heart and lungs and decreases risk of heart disease and some forms of cancer. Jump rope is great for this. You can also find videos online for dance or aerobics which are a lot of fun to do at home if you dont have equipment.   ,xxfitness,d8i2pr7,7,t5_2ryzy

9251916,0,t3_573ibt,Jessie Graff posted a video on FB of her beasting  pullups they looked from behind to be chest to bars too. Almost immediately some dickhead commented that she please try not to get bulky. Women should not have big bulky muscles. She handled it brilliantly and many others jumped in and told this asshat to shove it but seriously? It just pisses me off that this still happens.. Your opinion on what someone else should do with their body is NEVER valid or important enough to state. Youre an uninformed jackass. Women generally cant get bulky by accident looking at the fact that a woman like Jessie Graff is not bulky should be enough to tell you that and perpetuating this myth or telling women that they should not have muscles has an impact on young girls. It tells them that they must be weak and thin to be valuable and feminine. I hope youre happy with all of the eating disorders and cases of osteoporosis you are helping to cause jackass. .

Maybe the issue is that youre just burning way less calories than you think. So youre just going to have to recalculate and eat less. ,xxfitness,d8yx48l,67,t5_2ryzy
9347137,0,t3_58ilts,The food situation is probably the worst thing. The good news is if youre tracking macros and calories every day already you probably have a pretty good idea of how much food you need to eat even without counting. Calorie counting will be next to impossible since someone else will be preparing all of your food and all of it is premade garbage well not necessarily. If you have good CSs on your ship then you might get lucky. However it is still possible to eat fairly healthy. Fresh fruits and veggies may get scarce depending on how often you unrep or stop in port.My advice is to just watch your intake and always try to choose the healthiest option. I would also advise bringing as many of your own nonperishable snacks with you as you can and planning to order more to be delivered to you on the ship if you can although allow some extra time for delivery its not like you can get Amazon Prime in the middle of the ocean. I know you said youre going to be switching around so if you know your schedule see if you can order stuff to the next ship so its waiting for you Ive never tried this but I dont see why you couldnt do it. The snacks available in the ship store and on the mess decks will be mostly junk like pop tarts chips nutragrain bars that kind of thing. They usually had tuna in the ship store and sometimes had protein bars but it was mostly chips and candy.I cant even begin to imagine trying to do squats on a small boy they rock too much. When I was out I just did cardio on the treadmill so much fun its like running rolling hills! or on the elliptical but I saw a couple of the guys lifting every day so its not totally impossible. Id say you should probably try to make friends with the gym rats they should be able to give you some pretty good advice.  ,xxfitness,d90tezb,5,t5_2ryzy

I think food portions generally are designed for larger people so we grew up eating more than we should to begin with....i measured my body fat using an online calculator. its not completely accurate im sure hence why i wrote around hahahaha but makes sense since the last time i got an actual body fat measurement was in January at a gym I was thinking about trying when i lived somewhere else...and at the time it was around  and ive lost some weightmeasurements and been exercising a lot more lately in general since then. since i play soccer all of my muscle is in my quads and calves...and i have baby biceps and a decent core but underneath layers of fat i could be so much faster if I weighed a lot less haha.  ,xxfitness,d91r2ya,1,t5_2ryzy
9355718,0,t3_58knh8,Well elite athletes dont actually need more protein than beginner athletes as the body becomes more efficient at reusing protein from muscle breakdown and elite athletes arent putting on muscle as fast as novices. I think it would be fine if you eat at the elite level. I think .glb is a pretty good compromise where any protein after that is not providing you a lot of benefit. .g is may be slightly better for a lifter or if you are trying to lose weight but its not absolutely necessary.

I do the exercises and I feel incredibly selfconscious about how im doing them people looking at me while doing them and even then when Im doing the moves Im wondering to myself if this is the right path Im taking to get the results that I want. I know a lot of people who picked up weight training or exercising in general and yes successfully became strongermore flexibleskinnier in general but still dealt with a lot of problems or didnt get the results they quite wanted. Like for example having a nice perky strong round booty is ideal but I already have a big butt! it bounces annoyingly when I run and actually hurts from the bouncing. Same with my boobs. I know more chest exercises and improving my shoulder strength and core strength will help that and help my posture  cardio and diet will help aid weight loss so my boobs and butt will be LESS fat...but I dont want to still struggle with pants even if im technically at a smaller size because ill still have thick thighs and calves from soccer....cant wear winter boots or skinny jeans or the ones that do fit are too big in the waste or too long for my short body  i say short body because in height i am small but my legs are proportionately longer than my torso which also adds to my topheavy appearance   one i can stick to and enjoy is nice but ill stop enjoying it if im spending so much money sacrificing sleep and social life to doing something thats not helping me get where i want to be you know?i know there is no perfect routine or route from point A to point B and yes i knowww the journey is more important than the destination. but even in all the great adventure tales there is an amazing happy ending when they reach the final destination. and id so much love to reach this happy ending sooner so i can sooner begin my other adventures. ,xxfitness,d92zdsk,2,t5_2ryzy

A teacher will ensure you are doing poses correctly and safely and it can be difficult to follow along with videos because you cant see them when you are in some poses. I also find that more beginner poses are still enjoyable in a class setting and a good teacher will adjust the class so that every person is doing modifications to their level of ability. I did enjoy having a teacher who was very conscious of the meditative aspect of yoga as well as other arms like breath work. I started as I was coming out of an eating disorder and yoga made my body feel like my own. I went from feeling like I was a separate entity from my body to feeling myself in every limb. It cognitively lined up my perceptions of myself perceptions of my body and sensations of movement and touch in my body.,xxfitness,d9drm8i,1,t5_2ryzy

9471336,0,t3_5ac4im,Hi there uannkb.  Im a  year old guy whos been training for almost  years and I feel I have good advice to offer you.When I first started lifting I did sets like you until the muscle gets tired with proper form but I would usually stop whenever I reached a certain number.  About two years in I realized that my muscles require OVERLOAD to grow which can only be achieved through FAILURE on every set.  So say youre doing bicep curls and you do lb in each hand for  reps.  The most important thing is that after the th rep you literally cannot do any more.  The last few gutwrenching reps are the most important.  And for bodyweight exercises you must perform them until you literally cannot complete another proper rep.  Rep ranges are not as important since your muscles cannot count.  Now Im fully aware that many people on this sub and rfitness may not agree with this but I myself am a first hand example.  My first two years of lifting I trained with submaximal reps and only saw sub par gains once I started training to failure I saw significantly more definition.  And I know you will too!  Will post pictures per request.Heres a video on this topic by Jeff Cavaliere former strength coach for the New York Mets and physical therapist,xxfitness,d9gjpnx,1,t5_2ryzy

9511822,0,t1_d9lidil,Thanks! So I think I mentioned that I had given up on the challenge when I kept failing. Since then though I just kept myself dedicated to my lifting. I bulked winter of  had some health issues beginning of  but then Ive been consistently cutting and hitting the gym  days a week since April . I run PPLx with cardio before each lift session. I try to progress each week or at least maintain since Im on a cut by either increasing weights reps andor sets. About a month ago I was challenged to the  push up challenge and finished it. I spiced it up and did a variation each day. I think thats what also pushed me to go ahead and give this another go. I think the combination of lifts cardio and diet were the big factors. When youre doing mins of stairmaster in the mornings followed by lifts whats three and a half minutes of this right? At least thats what I told myself. I was dying at the end. Lol.

9517283,0,t3_5b2xk1,I was doing .kg bench and I eeked out a x only resting s between sets. After my last set I needed to switch to .kg rows so I thought thought why dont I just try to half rep it into the lowr saftey rack? Well why is that I could get half the bar on the safety but the other half wouldnt budge from my chest. Luckily the gym staff guy was looking in my direction while talking to this big guy so when I said help me they both came over immediately. And racked it for me. Then I busted out an easy x of rows. So alls well that ends well?Yeah... if anyone could tell me how to get out of that situation without help that would be great. My problem is I couldnt unrack the one side to do the roll of shame and the angle wasnt big enough for the weights to come off the side that I couldnt rack only my .kg came off not the kg. Probably the best thing I could do is not even try to rack it if a rep is not happening and just do the roll of shame?Anyway lesson learned just get up and move the barbell down like I did before.,xxfitness,d9m7hnu,1,t5_2ryzy

9526465,0,t3_5bbqk1,Depends a lot on the teacher and the classlevel thats available to you. Ballet is a good foundation but if you have a teacher who is not actively making corrections to your form which they tend to do less in the adult classes you may not get the results youre looking for. Also much of the muscle tone you build is related to bodyweight resistance and since the motivation is performance the muscle tone is a sideeffect and you wont see development as quickly as you would in a pilates class. However the performance aspect can be really powerful and amazing depending on the teacher. If you have a good adult ballet class in your area give it a try. I have not tried the other two styles.,xxfitness,d9nc6p9,7,t5_2ryzy

9551515,0,t1_d9l9sgg,I do feel a lot in the US like it is a catch   everyone wants you to be thin and hot and even people who arent typically only look up to people who are and put appearance over a myriad of other more important qualities. Youre ridiculed if you dont look like a fairly narrow mainstream definition of beauty in body type dress style facial features skin tone etc even by other people who also dont meet that definition. But then when you actually work to make your body a type that is more socially acceptable  whether for appearance health or both  suddenly youre that pathetic dieter trying too hard to impress people.Most people cant simultaneously rarely be active and eat whatever they want and look a way US culture considers attractive. Beyond that looking  a certain way doesnt always equate to healthy or feeling good. Sometimes I wonder if one reason there are many so many people are overweightobese in the US because our media pushes a standard that feels impossible then doesnt support any normal person trying to obtain it so people figure why bother. For instance our female celebrities are on average  taller but  pounds thinner than the average female celebrity in India.

You dont need to spend  hours a day seven days a week at the gym to have it be valuable.  days one hour about as much time as I spend right now since I work and am a fulltime student and Ive never felt like its not much. Just have smart workouts. And dont focus on exercise to lose weight  its not going to do that for you especially with those light weights. It will help you feel better and improve some general health but it wont lose the weight for you. Your food intake will do that. Good job on the weight loss so far. Check out bodyweight fitness for the basic routine and see if that will work for you. You can split the routine up into smaller sessions over the course of the day too. Treat the bike and whatever you do for the next few months as a fitness primer getting you from sedentary to beginner level.  Play around a little but try to have some consistency. The best routine is one that works for you and that you do regularly progressively.You really just need to get into big basic movements like squats dips planks pushups and pull ups will help from that routine. You dont need a bunch of these complicated nitpicky exercises you see in womens magazines that get pushed on us as  spot reducing or whatever. Or theres the the beginner nerd fitness program Google that! That you can do at home. I started with those for three months and had fun and then youll realize you need bigger heavier weights.

But you could still identify her by saying the girl with the ass because her hips and butt were her most identifying feature.She like you wasnt a big fan of this. She started doing yoga grew a little bit of visible back muscle and was instantly hooked. She wanted more of this definition thing. She started doing parallettes. And lifting. She paid more positive attention to her diet because food wasnt a proscriptive thing it was helping her meet her goals it was fuel. She started eating meat she had been vegetarian and settled on a mostly paleo scheme. Now she can do pullups. She doesnt currently count calories as that has not been psychologically good for her she uses the traffic light classification system. And her hips are no longer her most identifying feature. They didnt get smaller exactly but when she asked me to tell her if she had made progress she was disconcerted because her pants still fit I told her absolutely because the shape changed. Her assauxillary the fat deposit slightly below and to the outside of the ass proper reduced and her actual glutes got higher and more defined.

9929037,0,t1_db0eua3,To your health point I cant think of a chronic disease I havent seen associated with obesity including normal weight obesity. Atherosclerosis diabetes thyroid conditions PCOS rheumatologicalinflammatory conditions... for the last of those greater risk can be seen at even a lower BMI than the standard and vice versa more obese people have rheumatological conditions. Of course theres also MSK issues like joints wearing out though those can also happen with activity via injury but at least activity helps with bone density and protects in other ways. That  all sounds theoretical and far away and blah blah blah  to young people but its super not. All those things also happen to people at low BMIs but this has also been associated with too much adiposity. Being at a normal weight but overfat. Its the BMI undershooting. In some populationsMyself I feel ok at this weight at midnormal BMI. My boobs and face look good and I have enough muscle that a shape can be determined beneath fat on the lower half. This was not always the case ie around the time I had blood tests showing low creatinine which was at the same time I had a severe vitamin D deficiency which was when I was lighter even. Ive since read that that might not be coincidental ie that low muscle mass compared to fat contributes to poor metabolism of  vitamin D. Which by the way kicked my butt and I think  and have evidentiary reason to believe must have contributed in some way to later MSK problems... But Im still working towards increasing lean mass and reducing fat. Because  research is showing and my experience has been that most systems in the body tend to just function worse when theres a poor musclebonefat ratio. Regardless of weight speaking mostly because of an overabundance of fat.  Someone young might not be actively unwell but they might still not be optimally healthy. As far as what people consider attractive there are plenty of couples who are overweight so they are attractive by definition. A lot of men do like soft curves. Its just that its far away from the mainstream cultural ideal. Women often  police themselves and each other because of reasons mentioned by other people. I do think that in a society that values the idea of personal responsibility some make moral attributions when they see an overweight person. Probably not as much when its an area with a high obesity rate. ,xxfitness,db1s1p8,3,t5_2ryzy

Lately though its been getting heaver .x bodyweight and Ive found that my back has been starting to feel a little tender and so Im afraid of moving up the weight. My back has been taking most of the load and my hamstrings and glutes arent doing as much work as they should or could be doing. My coach and kinesthesiologist have been helping me fix it with the following Foam roll your hip flexors these SERIOUSLY hurt but are so so worth it Increase core strength via weighted core work and front squats Work on really activating your glutes. My problem was that I always initiated my squats by thinking butt out. My coach told me to try rotate knees out. Note that this is not just knees out but includes the word rotate. If you put your hand on your butt while doing this you should feel your glutes getting tight and becoming more activated. Do glute bridges beforehand but not so many that your glutes get tired and your back ends up taking over Try doing slow squats like a  second descent with a pause at the bottom. By going slow I really feel the burn in my glutes  I cant just divebomb the squats and use my back to raise the weight back up.Note these are based on me and my experiences!

10248438,0,t3_5mpcut,Youre still young and your body is still resilient. Id try just doing exercises with an empty bar for as many sets in the program as you can at least for the first day or even the first week until the DOMS go away. Youll likely get DOMS with any weight but if you stick to lifting consistently they wont come back even as you increase weights. Empty bar warmups are very worthy exercises because you can focus on form. You can feel for pressure on a joint or your back and try to correct your form until the weight feels equalized and you feel sturdy under. Weights are mostly about form a half an inch forward or back makes all the difference in a squat! I get a yoga like connection with what my body can do. Its fascinating to feel how hard it is to maintain form on a challenging weight like your body has the sensitivity for controls turned up so you wobble and go in directions you didnt want to. I feel accomplished when I can feel some core strength that wasnt there last week that lets me move up in weights and I can feel that mastery over a weight I couldnt handle as well last week.,xxfitness,dc5ptn4,2,t5_2ryzy

I do also work in a kitchen however though so I spend all day on my feet moving around which helps too. But anyway Ive seen great strength gains during this transition. Im deadlifting and squatting kg comfortably while coming back from a torn labrum. The most exciting improvement for me was going from  strict body weight pullup to now doing  no problem. So for me I think I wasnt paying enough attention to my recovery.

10290220,0,t3_5nb6c6,Sounds to me like your calorie intake is fine you are at a lowish healthy weight for your height. Just continue going to the gym and climbing adding in whatever activities you find enjoyable and challenging. You can alternate days of gym and climbing one day gym one day climbing repeat. Not everyone does cardio but I personally think its a good idea even just for cardiovascular health but thats just my personal opinion. Lots of lifters will do a  or  minute treadmill warmup and then do some lifting. If you want booty strength look into Strong Curves. Others use a lifting program like Strong Lifts but there are TONS of programs you just have to choose one that seems right for you. You dont need to change your calories right now until you get into a good physical habit. After  months or so you can reassess. Maybe youll want to up protein and lower carbs or maybe not!. You definitely dont need to lose weight though you just need to exercise your muscles to build them up and in doing so you will lose fat and gain tonedefinition.Good luck!,xxfitness,dcagakg,4,t5_2ryzy

Figured I would not cut and bulk for the comp. Worked out delightfully.Lifts went from  to  for sbd. Also I could still run fast. What did you change in your routine?I increased intensity and amount of workouts. I was working out  x per day sometimes  per day x per week and another x on Saturday. Lifting very heavy in the morning accessory lifts at lunch and running mi in the afternoon. disclaimer though I ended up overtraining while doing this... that is only because I did not factor enough rest into it. It is important to push hard when working out but also allow adequate time for recovery.  Diet?I was eating about  to  calories a day my metabolism kind of sucks and eating very high protein moderate carb and moderate fat. On the weekends I was lax with my diet but during the week ate high complex carbs and nutrient dense foods. How long did you bulk? years... haha. Forever bulk! Positive experiences?Energy up lifts up recovery time better felt better overall. Negative experiences?Didnt really have any.  As far as when the gains will come how intense are your training sessions? Are you pushing yourself to the max with your lifts? Are you increasing reps some days as well as weight on the bar? Bulking time is the best time to increase lifts and push yourself in training because theoretically the body has more energy to repair and build muscle. ,xxfitness,dcg76c4,4,t5_2ryzy

10363122,0,t3_5o6poz,First off you look amazing in your progress photos! Im super impressed that its only  or  lbs. Ive never done keto but I would  track calories for at least two weeks after adding carbs you lost around lbs because you ate less and you will regain that weight if you just add in carbs to your kept diet. Also if youve been avoiding wheat dairy soy or other foods that are relatively common intolerances Id take a whole approach to reintroduce one food at a time so that if you find yourself having GI problems you can pinpoint the food that triggered it. Figure out what you want to eat and how much a bowl of oatmeal with a tablespoon of peanut butter and an apple for breakfast baby carrots and an ounce of cheese for a snack soup and chicken salad for lunch etc etc. You already know how many calories you eat a day  and if you change your macros to allow for carbs you just need to maintain those calories and youll keep losing. If you arent happy with how quicklyslowly youre losing its because youre eating too many calories. Option A is that  calories a day has you losing less than a pound a week while option B is that youre eating more than you think you are. A small handful of nuts can be two ounces and if you only log them as one ounce thats a hundred calories or more that you are by accident. Option C is a mix of the two. ,xxfitness,dcipz9h,2,t5_2ryzy

This means making sure you are stocked with healthy food choices prepping your meals in advance so you dont have to make decisions when you are hungry and tired and planning your daysweeks so you can indulge a little now and then  being able to have a planned cheat now and then is what keeps you sane and allows you to adhere to your eating plan longterm.,xxfitness,dcllgtr,1,t5_2ryzy

10457725,0,t3_5pqxob,Im what is called a flexitarian never knew there was a word for it where I eat predominantly vegetarian but occasionally have meat I eat vegan sometimes too but dont go out of my way to  sometimes it just happens on accident. I really limit meat at home buy organic which is a mixed bag ethicallyecologically but does have some evidence of being better for the environment especially if you can buy local According to the USDA studies show ecological advantages of organic farming including maintaining soil quality reducing water contamination producing fewer greenhouse gases and conserving water. In fact the definition of organic farming established by the USDA National Organic Standards Board is rooted in ecological principles. . I mostly use meat more as a garnish to a dish and not the star  think a few oz of chicken in a soup or a grilled fish fillet with heaps of veggies. I avoid buying beef at home  after growing up on a farm and eating freshly processed beef store beef is disgusting  but honestly if youre going to consume dairy youre fueling the beef industry anyway  of the beef supply are dairy cows. I save most of my meat eating for when I go out on the weekends or special occasions like holidays  the occasional burger fried chicken pizza with meat ham at Christmas etc  and try to get quality from local places that are doing things from scratch rather than fast food. I had gallbladder issues for years and went through a stint of about six months where I ate vegan  of the time with some occasional super lean chicken or fish thrown in. It makes going out to eat and doing stuff at friends houses so difficult. I give props to people willing to do it but food is a huge social thing for me and occasionally eating meat just makes it easier to do things with the people I love. I firmly feel if some of the animal rightsecological improvement groups that advocate vegetarianism and veganism focused on just reducing meat consumption theyd get a lot more response from the general public. Many people are willing to eat less meat who arent willing to give it up and being a preachy zealot as a minority of nonmeat eaters can be doesnt help people focus on the science and ethics behind why meat consumption can be bad. I also think from growing up on a farm that there can be ethical ways to raise and slaughter animals and smallscale farming in general is more ecologically sustainable and less of a burden on the environment the slurry alone a big beef operation makes is terrifying. I dont have a moral problem with killing animals for meat  just in mistreating them beforehand  but I do think its important to reduce meat consumption and in turn herd sizes longterm for the environment.,xxfitness,dcthktd,2,t5_2ryzy
10458531,0,t3_5ots84,Im on the Batiste train on my in between days  I just think it smells really good and works so well when youre not into washing your hair every day its about the only dry shampoo Ive tried that hasnt looked like Ive either dumped talc onto my head or have a major case of dandruff. My hair is incredibly thick and used to be very long with it. I finally cut it when I really started working out just over a year ago for convenience sake but it still takes forever to get it dry and I find because I have a dry scalp anyway its not the best idea to be washing everyday. I tend to wash it every nd to rd day because if I wash it every day the oil production becomes uncontrollable with my scalp trying to rehydrate itself  same happens if I blow dry my scalp gets unbelievably oily so quickly afterwards its almost not worth even washing it in the first place.

10495138,0,t3_5qaedm,I have RA and lift  times a week plus cardio every morning before work. Generally you should be able to tell what you can and cant do because your body will tell you when to stop. For example when my RA flares up really badly I can hardly walk because of pain in my feet and ankles but the cross trainerelliptical is fine and cycling is fine because its low impact. I make sure I warm up well before starting and generally move slower when my joints hurt. I also find HIIT and high impact exercises are too much stress on my joints. Low intensity cardio is much better as stress definitely makes my RA worse. I definitely recommend exercising though. Staying still makes things much stiffer and more painful. I also suggest working out later in the day because generally RA is worse in the morning after lying still all night. Depending on your medication you might find some days youre really tired. For example the day after I take methotrexate Im really tired so would make that a rest day. You just need to see what you can do and where your limits are. Some exercises may always be off limits but it doesnt mean you cant get better at what you can do. ,xxfitness,dcxqfvu,9,t5_2ryzy

Found my motivation for changing started making a very small change such as walking for  minutes for  days a week yoga each day to correct a lot of muscle tension saw results built more selfefficacy Week  Encouraging results as I was going to the gym  days per week with strength training walking yoga and making small changes to the foods I eat This week week  Building on the results from the last two weeks and adding more to the strength training. My next goal is to start journalling meditation and other activities to help me build mindful awareness of my daily actions. Other goals I want to reach is being more consistent walking at nights preparing for the next day the night before and going to bed walking up earlier.

Because of the context. We were in a trainerled class and even though there were several of us in there the trainer was very good at correcting form and teaching the form correctly. The music was loud and the clock was counting down so I didnt want nor have the time to sit and talk with him. If he would have approached me after the workout I would have talked to the trainer and asked her opinion after class. This isnt to undermine him but honestly I dont really trust strangers when they come up to me and give me advice especially when this particular person was quartersquatting on his toes before.  But to be polite I would have listened if he approached me after the  minutes and not in the middle of the workout. Thats what annoyed me the most.

10883039,0,t1_de2h6ym,Ive had this problem before and some things that have really helped are. Try different stances. Wider or less wide foot placement feet placed at different angles  to  degrees outward. Lifters or if you dont have lifters placing a lb weight under each heel works pretty well.. Bar position  I preferred low bar back squats because of where the center of gravity is other people prefer high bar squats. Just be careful of good posture and shoulder mobility either way.. Do a bunch of different types of squats until the movement of getting to parallel becomes natural. Goblet squats front squats etc. Go light and really focus on form. . One of the most important things is stretching. Stretch your hips legs and ankles. Trouble reaching parallel can be related to ankle or hip mobility.I had major trouble reaching parallel even with air squats before trying these things. Bret Contreras and Alan Thrall also have a ton of great videos about squatting that will definitely be helpful. In the end though sometimes bodies are just kind of silly and dont want to cooperate with certain movements and in my nonprofessional opinion its better to be doing a movement with good form in as full a range of motion that you can than not doing it at all or going further than you should and having form break down.,xxfitness,de2iaut,7,t5_2ryzy

When I first transitioned to paleo I was really strict about it and only ate foods traditionally considered paleo by Dr. Cordain.

10929285,0,t1_de749ra,You need to work on some grip strength exercises.  There are lots of options but when I started I would   Hang from the pull up bar for time and try to do more and more.     Grab a dumbbell in each hand and just stand there holding them for time usually as heavy I could hold for  seconds for  sets with a  second rest in between.   Grab a dumbbell in each hand and walk back and forth aka farmers walks holding them as long as I could for some distance or  seconds.   I couldnt really squeeze the barbell clips together and slide them on the barbell with one hand.  My gym has extra barbell clips so sometimes when I was resting I would just practice squeezing one together.  ,xxfitness,de7a1ya,5,t5_2ryzy

I started with SLx and over time I began doing the same exercises  but with  of the max weight I can lift with more reps. Otherwise I just hit a moment where I cant stand up from a squat and Im afraid that Ill hurt myself. when I stopped following SL x very closely I was squatting . kg lbs and baaarely made ti back up so I deloaded to kg upped the reps and now I can squat kg and barely make it up again DgtYour body needs rest.I figured that out at some point but its more important for me to keep my mind busy right now. Thats why I spread everything in leg or upper body days with equal parts of compound exercises. I hope that will kind of prevent major booboos.

Lets say you do use creatin then its for the trainingperiod when you bust your ass of. When you take your resting weeks with a not so heay workout load it becomes expensive urine. Then just eating good nutitional food is enough to keep you energized. So not directly that the body gets used to it more indirect out of what are you doing right now. Same with protein sup. The body takes what it needs for the moment.

Anyway if I bought a larger size suit bottom it might cover more of my backside... but would fall down from my waisthips. I would often wear either swim shorts or athletic shorts of some sort like yoga shorts just to get better coverage and somedays even just full pants. Those shorts that went like a few inches down many girls thighs mostly just covered the bulk of my butt on me. Technically many of the shorts and pants I ownedwore werent within the dress code something to do with our uniform but thankfully my boss seemed to realize it was an effort for modesty. And part of that might have been that the only complaints he ever seemed to get about me were from usually older women who werent happy that OMG the lifeguard has to wear a swimsuit!

11122487,0,t1_desid9x,I second all of this.  calories a day would probably result in gradual weight loss for someone your height if you were sedentary. Weight training  days  week is pretty far from sedentary. Remember that in order to achieve sustainable weight loss you must eat a sustainable diet.Ditch the scale. It isnt going to help your body get to where youd like it to be. Muscle is much denser than fat so as you gain strength through lifting it isnt uncommon to also notice some weight gain. Heres my personal anecdote Im  and once upon a time weighed about lbs. I hated my body and desperately wanted to shed some of my fat especially from from my stomach. When I reached my goal weight lbs after months of restrictive eating and exhausting cardio sessions I was dismayed to find that I still wasnt satisfied my stomach was still pudgy. I ended up losing a lot more weight and developed an eating disorder in the process but thats another story. My point being that although I lost the weight I didnt like the way I looked or felt. Fast forward  years Im still  and lbs again. But after years of strength training I look completely different from my former lbsself. Im strong as fuck and it shows  I love my arms legs back chest and even my stomach at least on my good days lol. I threw away my scale years ago and it was one of the best decisions Ive made regarding my fitness progression. I know I would have flipped a shit if I had watched myself gain  fucking pounds over the course of two years told myself I was a complete failure and turned back to literally running myself into the ground.tldr get rid of your scale. Keep busting your ass weight training eat properly and youll see positive results in good time. Dont expect to get abs overnight be consistent and sustainable. ,xxfitness,desq3qt,6,t5_2ryzy

Either she is not counting the alcohol or she isnt accurately measuring her food. water retention. Glycogen can cause this and it will go away. Lifting doesnt make you fat and there is pretty much no way that after only a month she has put on that much muscle. Her metabolism and yours work exactly the same way just as any other healthy humans does. When I am eating with my husband if I dont measure my food I gain weight from the extra calories due to eating larger portions.

Magazines like Mens Health are meant to cast a wide net to accommodate as much of the potential demographic as possible. You may not see it reflected in communities like ours but across the general population its undeniable that the number one reason anyone is at the gym is aesthetic.

If youve ever read Shape I dont have to tell you it applies with womens magazines too.Its obviously subjective but I like things like this. I think articles like this are a reflection of changing culture and the fact women are increasingly common in what are seen as traditionally male sports like weight training.The only kind of shitty part about it is titles like women who can squat more than you are definitely mean to imply you weak manlet and play off insecurities.

11208530,0,t3_5zwwuh,I think about all the stuff I can do now that I couldnt when I started. Even if my accomplishments are meager versus someone else they are mine. Like I can bench  pounds now instead of . I can climb the stairs to my room without puffing and having my heart rate shoot up actually my previously justokay blood pressure and resting heart rate are both down. I can hike or speed walk and still carry on a conversation. I can shovel my driveway without hurting myself or being crazy winded. I can bendsquat to getdo things more easily and with better form so I dont hurt my back. Im more flexible and have more stamina including cough in bed cough. My body and mind feels better  less aches and pains other than the typical postwork out ones less stress less depression. So much of how we see ourselves is psychological versus reality subjective versus objective. I can look the same two days in a row but if the scale says I weigh more the second day or some other external factor makes me feel less fit my body looks less fit to me in the mirror. Its in my head  my measurements are the same. My clothes fit the same. I think its important to play the long game  to not stress about not quickly seeing results in the mirror or on the scale or even to some degree in measurements. Its the gains you make over time that are important and the fact that you are putting in the effort. Its always smart to take a step back and look at our approach am I working out efficiently? Do I have an accurate TDEE? Am I tracking carefully? Am I pushing myself? etc but for some people it takes longer for things to fall into place. Theres nothing wrong with that. I took almost two years to make slow changes to my exercise and diet before I went on a strict program and it made all the difference in resetting how I behaved and how I thought about myself. I realized even before I achieved major weight loss I felt better. I was at least making the effort. So when I got to the program it was less of a hardship to stick to the goals it set for me and I already had the right mindset.  ,xxfitness,df2h2yi,2,t5_2ryzy

11232709,0,t3_60c0th,So this will totally vary based on your personal metabolism etc. but Im  and  and my natural set point seems to be about  pounds when Im not monitoring my diet in any way. I am SO not into being on a diet as I get obsessed really easily and it quickly eats up a lot of my time and mental energy. But these are some loose rules Ive been following. My main motivation is wellness but when I eat like this paired with moderate workouts  times a week my weight goes down to .I dont keep dairy products in my home. Dairy is limited to eating out or the very rare cases where I feel like I MUST have a pizza or die usually PMSbreakfast is as much fruit as I want up to three servings either fresh or frozen. If Im still hungry Ill add a small serving of instant oats.lunch and dinner is anything I want with a focus on whole foods vegetables beans tofu lentils nuts and whole grains cooked from scratch. I make a big batch of two or three dishes on the weekend or when I have time.If you want junk food or dessert cook it yourself. Youll end up eating less just because of the effort and youll probably make it less caloric and salty and bad for you than the processed foods you buy in stores. Also if Im eating junk food or dessert and notice Im really hungry I will stop and force myself to eat a real food snack first then return to the treat when Im full. That stops me from mindlessly gorging and lets me appreciate what Im eating. Same with sugary drinks and alcohol I have to drink them because I want to not out of thirst. If Im thirsty Ill drink water.I keep basically no sugar in my house except a bag of sugar for baking desserts and some frozen cakecookies in my freezer. I dont even put sugar in my coffee. Sugar is everywhere in processed foods like bread. If you read the labels you can keep it out of your house.I dont restrict my eating in any way when Im eating out or on my period. Your mileage may vary if youre a person who eats out a ton but for me its a special treat to myself and I dont want to stress. I eat very simply  of the time when Im at home so that I can enjoy the occasional indulgence.,xxfitness,df57nq4,38,t5_2ryzy
11237207,0,t3_60dzhs,You need to find a way to fix that stance pronto because it is not doing you any favors.  Bring your feet out in point the toes out or keep them more center...something has to change.  Experiment and see what works.  But on to whats going wrong hereFirst off youre sticking your butt way too far out.  Try to break at the knees first instead of at the hips and think about sinking DOWN between your hips instead of sitting back.  This cue isnt necessary for everyone because everyone has different issues and limits and stances but in your case it will probably help to break this bad movement pattern of sticking your butt out.  Keep your chest up.  Seriously keep it UP because when you do this you should feel a point in your descent where your hips and knees will naturally do the rest of the movement for you and sort of welcome the proper coordination needed to keep getting lower.  Just be sure youre not going so low you start to butt wink.  Dont think about arching your back  think about bracing and keeping a NEUTRAL spine.  The spine already has a natural slight curve at the low back.  You dont need much more than that natural arch when squatting.Second youre not hitting parallel.  This is because your stance or your cues are not suited for your build or level of mobility.  Deload and figure out which stance suits you best and once youve figured it out hit volume like crazy for a while so you can deeply pattern the proper movement.  You want the right form to become muscle memory.  Speaking from personal experience I got the most comfortable with squats when I did x twice a week after my heavy sets plus x front squats to improve my core and upper back and to build mobility in my hips.  Light weight pause squats help I sometimes throw them in with my warm up or on off days.  After about two months of this squatting became a much more natural movement.  I still have to frequently cue myself about keeping my chest up and breaking at the knees but when I remember to do that it cleans up my form immediately.Weightlifting shoes are also an A idea especially if you find yourself moving more towards a narrower stance or high bar.  I hope this helps.  Everyones body is so different its hard to know what the magic solution will be.  Please update us on your progress!,xxfitness,df5pzlw,7,t5_2ryzy

Theres some fitness guy who lost twenty pounds eating just twinkies. Really you just have to eat below your TDEE. You didnt mention any of your stats but you can calculate it pretty easily online. At least a rough one. From there subtract as many calories as you want to lose. Whats recommended is dont go below a cal daily deficit or losing a pound a week. Itll be on the slow side but easier to maintain than some fad crash diet. Start tracking the food you eat there are tons of great easy to use apps and lean towards taking the more active choice of getting around. For example take the stairs instead of the elevator or bike to class instead of taking the bus. Those arent necessary to lose weight but they are good for you!

The gym is usually full of super fit Olympian types with some skinny guys also. There are a few women I see lifting heavy sometimes and sometimes I see girls learning to lift with their boyfriends. I was scared to use the weight room until I finally sucked it up and went during vacation time when it wasnt super full. My fianc showed me the basic equipment I lifted before but never at this gym. Every place is a little different. Now I go by myself three times a week no big deal. Once you start it isnt as intimidating. Very few people really seem to care about my existence there.

What if you went at maintenance with diet and continued to work out? Your body might need a little extra fuel with your new workout regime especially because it is focused on building strength.  I had once had success on a low carb diet in losing weight.  A couple years later I had started crossfit and tried to do the low carb plus crossfit and it was a disaster. I was so tired and sore and just felt like shit.  I talked to my coach who suggested I take in more carbs and right away I felt better and was back on track.  If your goal is more to build muscle and you arent worried as much about the weight on the scale eating at maintenance and doing strength building exercise is the way to go. ,xxfitness,dfnj5hx,3,t5_2ryzy

Also since Im low on funds too I wanted to make sure I was dedicated enough to lifting before joining a gym or buying more equipment power rack and barbell stuff. My goal is if I hit benching lbs with dumbbells then Id consider finding a gym to go to. Like thatd give me time to get strong feel dedicated and save money for a gym membership.Also I like that having dumbbells require me to get better at stability. Im really interested in the Strongman mindset of lifting obscure heavy objects so practicing stability in different ranges of motion is great.I do a lot of squats deadlifts and stairs for lower body stuff. Sometimes I also do pull ins I dont remember if thats exactly what theyre called where you lay down stretch your legs out hold a dumbbell between your feet and pull your legs toward your body.

I just finished my first bulk gained lbs and am at the heaviest I have been in  years just a few lbs shy of my heaviest weight ever. Last time I was over lbs it was due to depression related overeating lots of wine and inactivity. I looked like a blob and felt so uncomfortable in my skin roll everywhere and impeded mobility. Now I honestly dont look that different than I did lbs ago and still fit into almost all the same clothes I was wearing lbs ago. I didnt gain weight in my face major issue before and my pants are now too tight from my booty gains not the belly flab I was sporting the last time I tipped a dime and a half.So even if you dont decide to start bulking yet just know your postbulk body wont look anything like it did before at a higher weight!,xxfitness,dfu7435,2,t5_2ryzy

Pasta vs pasta with oil and vegetables or a handful of chips or whatever. For most of them simply the act of consciously writing down what they ate made a big difference.

Whenever I take selfies its at a downward angle which is much more flattering than in some group photos where were all huddled together and someone is shooting the photo at an upward angle to catch the faces of the tall people. Also when I take a selfie I can look at myself and make microadjustments to make myself look according to expectations. A postworkout group photo where I cant gauge my appearance usually means Im in an unflattering pose with bad posture from being exhausted from the workout. Even something as simple as how you put your hair up can change your look for a photo i.e. having my hair in a loose ponytail makes me look softer in photos compared to a tight ponytail.

11602401,0,t3_65l6x4,Have you tried goblet squats? The form is a little different but itll give you a feel for the weight. If you can do lb goblet squats use kettlebellsdumbbells to full depth parallel or lower for at least a couple of reps you should be able to use a standard empty bar which should be lb.It will feel different than an actual squat because the weight is in front during a goblet squat rather than behind you as it is during a squat. You can practice squat form using a dowelstick or broom if you want. You can also get a spotter to help you if you fail a staff member a random gym bro etc.For programs I recommend StrongliftsStarting Strength  just check out the stuff on the sidebar.

My bf and I both love to workout and its awesome. We lift together when we can we go hiking together and try new meal preps together. When we were cutting last year we helped one another eat as clean as possible and limit the amount of candy unhealthy binges we had. We get really excited when one of us hits a new PR and it motivates us even more since exercise is something we do together.With that said if I date someone I wouldnt NEED them to be as muscular as my bf or have as great abs as he do.

11779549,0,t3_681q4f,So recently the squat form at my gym has been horrible. So bad. Like some dude warms up with the bar and does half squats and then throws on two plates still doing half squats where he falls forward on his toes and I just cringe overall. A few days ago there was only one person out of six who was doing full squats to parallel with correct form.  Two of the rest of the six was a guy trying to teach his friend how to squat too. And the friend had lbs on each side and wasnt going deep enough and falling over on his toes... The one teaching also stopped watching just as the friend got all wobbly and actually needed a spot and decided to flex in the mirror instead. I was deadlifting right next to them and so desperately wanted to correct their form but also didnt want to be the knowitall girl who makes them feel less masculine... I feel like if I were a giant jacked dude they would love critique and respect it but as a small white girl theyd just scoff at me even though Im lifting as much as them. Gah.Anyways! To my point. Yesterday I was doing chesttri day and the guy on the bench next to me was actually teaching his friend proper form! I was shocked. It was like a unicorn in the weight room. They were doing DB rows and the guy made sure his friend brought the dumbbell to his hip not just straight up. After that he even corrected his friends lateral raises too! I wanted to give him an award after all the terrible spottersform Ive seen in the last week. It made my day!

But second please dont worry too muchI knew  wasnt a great way to live and havent gone backI get either so hungry or so tired that I end up eating more by the end of the day anyway.

The emphasis is all on losing weight and getting in shape is only a means to that end or a happy side effect. Weight loss is the top priority and honestly Ive made it my top priority as well.
