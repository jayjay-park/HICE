Plus it works wonders on a greasy cook top. Double plus  it comes in a glass bottle so its fully recyclable! ,ZeroWaste,cqrxh6c,4,t5_2wf12

An employee at cinema I got the bucket from though did have an issue with it because he claimed it wasnt the same size as the one I was requesting so I had to explain he could use their measure and then reuse that container. They ended up serving  me more but I think that was just out of confusion. Its silly though they did SELL that container at their Star Wars premiere. ,ZeroWaste,d2pwcey,3,t5_2wf12

What else do you know about the guy?  If hes an anticapitalist and works in his spare time on antiimperialist and anticap issues then hes doing more for zero waste than you are. Maybe hes a plant based vegan in which case hes also doing more than a meat eating ZW person to help the planet. ,ZeroWaste,d7gysxv,1,t5_2wf12

10799862,0,t3_5ugt09,I can totally relate to this as when I started the zero waste lifestyle I was eating at the college dorms and then moved out and was a little surprised how much I spend on groceries. What I think helped was a I knew that the benefits for my health and the environment were huge if I bought packaging free and organiclocal produce b take a look at your entire budget! After going zero waste I spent way less on bathroom products and clothes which easily made up for the price of the food. I would suggest trying it for a month or two and really seeing if the costs dont even themselves out.If you still find its too expensive maybe reconsider the types of food you are buying? If potatoes packaging free are super expensive maybe try another vegetable that is cheaper? Or incorporate bulk pastas as a substitute? I think it takes a lot of playing around with to find the right diet at the right price for each person. ,ZeroWaste,ddtxg1p,8,t5_2wf12

10937902,0,t3_5w7fdw,I mean buyinggetting things secondhand really is best as it in theory will drive down the demand for that item and decrease the energyresource expenditure. I dont think Ill be dumpster diving anytime soon but if people do or if they get hand me downs or use resources like Craigslist and freecycle to get most of their stuff I think thats pretty carbon neutral. I would categorize it slightly different than zero waste because of the methods. Zero waste avoids trash and freegans would avoid buying trash effectively same outcome since no money is spent on plastic packaged goods.  Also the political agenda goes way farther than zero waste takes it I think. According to the Web page they are vegans who believe housing is a right and drive biodiesel cars if they drive at all. I dont know. I like what they stand for but I dont know how much dumpster diving or squatting is really going to help with a favorable image. ,ZeroWaste,de8622u,7,t5_2wf12
