4068483,0,t1_crk02ql,I knew about San E when he was in Georgia so I definitely remember the flack he got about JYP. I remember all the korean adults asking how he was able to join an idol group with his looks lolololol. Ohh that makes more sense about all the nonAOMG artists playing Hot Summer. I knew why the AOMG kids played it since Gray produced the track but I didnt get why all the other rappers were posting it too.,khiphop,crk1a8b,4,t5_2vuc3
