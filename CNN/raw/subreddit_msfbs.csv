631629,0,t1_cgbxzcz,Yup. In all honesty Im still partially convinced that the whole thing was instigated just to piss everyone in ratheism off and its just a long troll. I mean I get that it was a hell hole before but it pretty much was a self contained hell hole. It was pretty clear a lot of the sub didnt like the changes. Why not just leave it alone and harvest karma and funny copypasta off it? How funny would it be a year after may may June jij was just like hey guys looks like youve been bamboozled and the sub had another meltdown? ,msfbs,cgc2f11,1,t5_30h92
814210,0,t1_cgwtsik,Yeah probably so. Bar maybe setting the old euphoria gauge to maximum? I dunno I guess we can jerk a little bit harder than usual or something. I might post about it on ICJ as well and refuse to admit that  means nothing in Ireland.,msfbs,cgwtv72,2,t5_30h92

1846836,0,t3_2esukz,Really its neither.  Its entirely secular in the sense of not having any inherent preference for any one religious or nonreligious view over another.  A lot of more conservative Christians could be offended by the content while some atheists might think that its intended to make fun of atheism rather than a handful of interesting individual atheists but that would be the only impact that I could see religion having on preference for the sub.,msfbs,ckbqmly,2,t5_30h92
