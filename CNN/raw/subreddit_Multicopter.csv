Ive never had an APM but if it calibrates itself as soon as you turn it on and youre turning it on while holding it at an angle it could also cause this.Try throttling up enough that its got some juice but not enough that it tips over then play with the sticks and see if it moves in the direction youre inputting If you do it just right it wont tip over but you should be able to see one side of it move which will give you an indication as to what the MC is thinking.

Dont want to risk hurting someone.  Flying over houses was uninentional.  I had always kept it above the lake where no one would get hurt if I crashed but one day when I switched to fpv I got disoriented and ended above land.  Couldnt find my way back to the lake and ended up crashing.  Decided that a quad would be a better approach for fpv because I have the option of stoping and getting my orientation whereas with a plane you must always go forward.

754988,0,t1_cgq361w,My KerbalSpaceProgram experience tells me you should think about some system that automatically or RC controlled drops batteries as they are drained.  You would probably need to have rc controlled relays so you can drain batteries one at a time.As an oversimplified example Lets say the quadcopter weighs kg and has x kg batteries on it. At full weight kg  lets assume those  batteries can run it for  hour doing nothing fancy.   But now if we know a single battery has the power to lift kg for mins. If you run  battery flat in mins then drop it. The second battery only has to lift kg  so might get up to  more runtime Im sure things arent exactly linear with motor efficiency etc so likely a bit less. So now you get a total runtime of hrmin.  The more batteries the have that you gradually drop the better overall efficiency you get.

961155,0,t1_chdiy6c,No worries. Links will get broken by changes in page layout its just part of the job.gt Two even if commercial use does get defined it would apply on a countrybycountry basis. The US view on commercial use may be different from the Australian view for instance.Good points however understanding the target audience of the subreddit is pretty important for keeping perspective. Usually the people who know better dont need these pages or have looked it up for themselves. If they dont know enough and get show over here by us then its better to err on the side of caution and explain what constitutes a commercial op over a recreational one and then proceed to say you probably shouldnt do commercial stuff without more research.In almost all cases when there are regulations in place the regs will vary between commercial and recreational use. To my understanding this applies much like the PPLCPL where they are pretty much standard worldwide. If there is a difference it can be stated on a countrycountry basis as needed. Hopefully this would reduce overlapping content and allow focus on special cases when they do occur.gt .GHz and .GHz are not strictly speaking approved for the purposes we use them for.

And you cant have a . rc receiver right next to a powerful video tx so theyve had to move the rc to .

1838965,0,t3_2fmy6r,There is the center of thrust which is the center of the X created by drawing imaginary lines through diagonal pairs of motors.There is the center of mass which is the point where the craft can be balanced on a point. You can move the center of mass by adjusting battery and other weight placement.The center of mass is also the point around which the craft will rotate whether it be yaw pitch or roll.Locating the center of mass on the center of thrust helps the craft use the motors evenly.Locating the flight controller on the center of mass helps the flight controller feel accelerations more accurately.The flight controller has two types of sensors gyros and accelerometers. Gyros measure rotation and accelerometers measure acceleration gravity is acceleration. Gyros are used to keep the flight controller aware of any rotations and are used to keep the craft locked into the attitude it wants or into the rate of rotation that it wants. Gyros work perfectly fine no matter where in the craft they are located. Gyros are use in all modes of flight.Accelerometers are used mostly to keep an understanding of where gravity is pulling you. Accelerometers are used in autolevel modes like angle horizon etc. If your craft levels itself without you needing it to you are using accelerometers. If accelerometers are located too far from the center of mass then they will feel acceleration from centripetal forces when the craft rotates. This can be interperetted as a shift in gravity and may cause temporary autolevel issues.Try to imagine yourself standing on the edge of a carousel facing the center. You will have to lean forward to maintain your balance. If you were standing in the center of the carousel you wouldnt feel the need to lean at all. In this metaphor you are the flight controller and the carousel is the multirotor.,Multicopter,ckasiex,18,t5_2u9hy

Maybe a lighter battery too perhaps mAh.Swapping the props for  inch ones might make a improvement but most  sized frames are quite tight on the prop clearance.The oscillations could be a number of things. Throttle calibration isnt necessary on the Multistar ESCs but you should make sure theyre set up for multirotor use such as turning off the brake setting. I think the oscillations are probably due to there not being enough thrust available to steady the copter properly.,Multicopter,ckfa0cd,3,t5_2u9hy

As you are only flying in a park on a field assumption from your parts list you can swap out batteries quickly and easily and continue flying more slightly shorter flights.But I would also look into getting slightly bigger  S batteries as they are sold very  cheaply cheaper than other batteries per mAhEdit here his a  S  with the same discharge of C for . international wearhouse it is a zippy which some people have claimed to have problems with but I have never had  problems with mine S  so for the price they make sense to me.Also with a larger capacity battery you may be able to buy a lower discharge battery such as a C constant C burst. giving A constant A burst on a  This would be lighterquicker and even cheaper but it depends on your use case if you expect to do a lot of wep passes a higher discharge would be better for the life of the battery,Multicopter,ckon34t,1,t5_2u9hy

I ran it all through ecalc carefully and it all checked out safely. They havent been hot after flying.  Honestly im still on the fence on the OrangeLRS. Last time I flew it seemed I was having some link issues at only around ft out. Still figuring that out. But for the cost its totally worth exploring or even replacing modules if my issue is perhaps a quality control one. I used openLRSng then openLRSng gitsly which required arduino programming then Flipflaps openLRS that you linked to with telemetry. Only the gitsly was semi difficult openLRSng and the Flipflap are so easy a monkey could do it. Just plug in the board with a  programming card on ebay and select what module you have from the list and if you want it programmed as RX or TX then hit write. Done.I sold my mhz telemetry radios and all my telemetry is transmitted over the OpenLRS link. I have droidplanner running on my phone and mounted to my radio.

2363809,0,t1_cm3u7eo,SX is a solid choice as is the S. I would recommend getting one refurbished it looks like the S is on sale again now I would pick it up.Geotagged pictures greatly increase the accuracy of the D model as well as greatly reduce the time required to process the model.  images isnt too much but for the types of flights I run acres  images its a matter of saving hours. When the pictures are geotagged the matching algorithm is preseeded with the relative locations of the shots as they were taken which means it has a good idea which pictures are going to overlap rather than looking for matching points in all of them.In order to get good enough geotagging out of the APM logs you really need to have the camera being TRIGGERED by the APM so youd need a USB trigger cable. On the other hand with a GPSequipped camera you can just set an intervalometer to take pics every  seconds or so and not worry about having it triggered by the APM as they will be geotagged by the camera.

2493805,0,t1_cmk2ctc,gt I wouldnt agree with that. What specifically do you think they are lying about? You may not agree with how they interpret laws and regulations but that is a bit far from being established liars. Here is an example on page  item .  The FAA is clearly claiming that AC  has some kind of legal authority.  The FAAs only authority come from rules called FARs they know this it is their purpose yet they try to use an advisory circular to coerce people.  . The fact is at the moment they have no authority for those cease and desist letters because there is no FAR in place that regulates what they are sending cease and desist letters over.  They are lying about what authority they have.  That was proven in the trappy case yet they still assert that have authority that a judge has ruled they dont.  Basically once they do create an FAR it will come down to that footnote on page  of that FAA document you linked earlier.gtA commercial operator is a person who for compensation or hire engages in the carriage by aircraft in aircommerce of persons or property . . . . See  CFR .. The FAA would therefore not consider a commercialoperation to be flown strictly for hobby or recreation purposes because it would be conducted for compensation orhire. This clearly goes against common sense that just because someone makes money does not mean that what they are doing is not a hobby.  To be a legitimate commercial enterprise and not a hobby turning a profit has to be the primary purpose of the activity.  As an example A hobbyist is flying his quad with a gopro and happens to film something newsworthy like a fire or a crash etc.  Selling that footage to a TV station or other news organization does not suddenly turn his hobby into a commercial enterprise.  Yet under the FAAs interpretation the moment he accepted compensation for video captured from a flying quad his hobby is no longer a hobby.Another example A quad pilot with a video rig occasionally take pics and video of houses for sale that are represented by his friend who is a real estate agent.  The agent pays his friend with the quad.  Simply accepting money does not turn the quad owner into a commercial operator.,Multicopter,cmk2tuo,1,t5_2u9hy

2505294,0,t3_2obj1n,Heres a wiring diagram that I found usefulI also made my own for the KK board but its mostly the same for each flight controllerAbout the ESC Two wire side is to connect to the battery. Red for pos and black for neg as usual. The thick three wirebullet connector side is to connect to a motor. The wires from motor to ESC can be in any order. If they arent spinning in the desired orientation you can switch any two wires. The smaller  wires servo connector connect to your flight controller.Connecting the ESC to the Naze Connect each ESC to its corresponding pin location figure  on the Naze. Use the manual to find this location The pins are the ones closest in your image of the Naze. The order matters! Connect positivepositive negativenegative and signalsignal. This is marked in the manual diagram and on the board itself.The Naze will get power from the V ESC connections. There should be no need to wire the battery to the Naze unless you want to use its voltage measuring capability but lets keep it simple for now.

2765559,0,t3_2rq206,DJIs S looks like it might fit the bill. I think the biggest challenge is going to find a legal video transmitter. Most transmitters on the market require an amateur radio licence to use legally which means they cant be used for commercial use.  Transmitters need to be FCC approved and to get that approval there is a mW limit on .Ghz.DJIs light bridge might be your best bet. Combined with high gain antennas you might be able to get the range you need. I dont know if there is an antenna tracker off the shelf that will work with DJIs tech. Id also be looking at a portable mast that can get your antennas well up above the tree line. I would suggest building a  sized quad first. The building process will get you familiar with the fabrication and repair techniques. It lets you know what can go wrong and learn the troubleshooting processes on something cheap to crash. As others are saying learn to fly on a micro quad like the NanoQX.  Fly that on a daily basis for the next few month. Get to the point where you can fly forward backwards and sidewards through a figure  course. Flying is really going to be the easy part of what your trying to do. Maintenance repairs and recovering crashed multi copters is going to be most of the job.  I hope you have around k to invest in equipment. Sure you could build multicopter to do this job for k but then you crash it and you still need to finish the job to get paid. Id plan on building atleast two and have enough replacement parts on hand to build a rd. You might be flying in the middle of nowhere but there is still a very large risk of starting a forest fire. When the big lipo batteries go up they really go up in flames and it doesnt take much of crash to do so. How are you going to get to a crash site quickly? How are you going to get the fire out? ,Multicopter,cnifm0h,1,t5_2u9hy

I guess you could try better antennas.  gtHow do you have you FPV cam mounted?  I use both my gopro on the gimbal and a board camera as my FPV cams. I have a switch to flip between the two. The problem is that with the  axis gimbal and a second operator its possible to end up with the camera looking some direction other than forward.

Once the battery is on top all of the vibrations get soaked up by the bottom plate section  a brilliant design!Putting the battery on top although it can easily be mounted underneath also assists in the reduction of jello because it makes the electronicscamera plate nice and heavyWhat it looks like unfolded angle is a bit weird but its basically a deadcat frameI really really like the idea of using the rubber screws to separate the electronics plates from the ESC  motor plates and I dont know why more designs dont do it that way.,Multicopter,cnqrpkt,2,t5_2u9hy

Not a stable flyer like your Tarot T or the Tricopter of the video i posted. Third i fly with a KK.. which is not as stable in the air like a pixhawk apm or Naza and a few other FCs out there...So if im at the point of testingtuning when i just cant tune it anymore and its still not near the standards i would like to see ill switch to the mentioned reptile  frame with brushless gimbal anyway.But i like to try and see for myself first. ,Multicopter,co3in6n,1,t5_2u9hy

3009412,0,t3_2ulcc3,It hovers fine but nose up because of the angle of the mounts.  You have to set your Flight Controller up in GCS base flight or whatever youre using to compensate for the new angle of the flight controller at hover. I started at  degrees but it wanted to drift forward in a hover so I had to increase it a bit. Also be aware that the angled mounts increase the stress on the arms in a crash! Ive cracked the front arms on two carbon frames since I started using them. I ended up building a brace out of parts cut from a broken frame. As far as motors go I run Sunnysky s. The only complaint with them is that they are all the same. Theres no reverse threaded CCW version. With the in props the hubs are so thick that the by lock nuts dont screw on far enough to hold that well so I spin off props in crashes a lot.,Multicopter,co9x92w,1,t5_2u9hy
3011819,0,t1_coa2v6z,anything in theory is possible a mph gust of wind could toss your salad cutter drone into someones face.it could also toss a tree into their face.what is LIKELY is relevant not what you can fantacize about and make happen with rigged conditions.ANY blast capable of tossing your DRONE into the crowd is by definition also enough to toss DEBRIS into the same crowd. SO not relevant.the closer you are the safer since you increase the odd of destruction of your drone versus simply disabling it partially. it is simply NO RISK that is relevant to calculate.NOW start talking about a  pound or  pound drone now your talking a very different story because INERTIA could allow that drone to carry itself out of control into people. Big difference.still quite safe though if the people are a safe distance from the implosion.stop fear mongering over harmless drones and use reason and sanity to think about it.they are simply NOT DANGEROUS in terms of we need to ban or control these things to the extent that some people want too.MOVING commercial services? such as delivery? YES that needs to be regulated.but people flying their toy camera platforms or commercials users hovering over head to take pictures of a building home or farm.ZERO DANGER to the public.flying around on internal gps guidance out of LOS?

Isolated by various means of dampeners.Here are a few links for review if you havent seen them.LinkLinkOn my s the FC deck was  above the top of the frame.  I noticed no difference in controltuning requirements between the SpiderHex which has the FC right on top of the frame.  Both dead center on CoG.

3432073,0,t3_2zj2fs,Yeah so Im flying a F with a s  and got  minutes today first time I got it out for that long. And I got it out that long because I calibrated the Naza correctly. The reason your bird started to descend is because you have your second level protection is set too high this forces half stick to not maintain hover forcing you down. So in the software you want to put your second level protection at the bottom of your voltage limit. so Im not sure how your batteries in parallel work I think it acts as one s right? So I set mine at .vs that gives me a little cushion to land. Then I set my first level at .vs.You also need calculate loss. To do this set your first level at a really high point. I would say v less than a full charge. Fly around until you see the red lights start flashing. Land immediately and check your voltage. Subtract that voltage from your starting voltage and thats your loss. it caps at .v in the softwareFlash that to your naza and you should be good to go! ,Multicopter,cpjhdlp,2,t5_2u9hy

Having a higher alarm voltage also helps to mitigate the risk of one cell being unbalanced and going under critical levels As Bexamous mentioned above.Also you need to make sure your battery is rated to handle your setup or youll get very short flights and a lot of sagging.

3553788,0,t1_cpxb82s,Just the answer that I was looking for thank you kindly. I just didnt really know what to expect hadnt really watched videos of these little starters. I assume the  Husban and similar Syma are the same sort of deal?I havent been to a big park yet only working with about a  W x  D x  H grassy space that my neighbors let me use with trees and powerlines so I dont have a lot of room to maneuver or go too high. So a lot of it might be prop wash issues too and I certainly noticed that you lose altitude especially when rolling cause I kept trying to just hover  inches off the ground and it would hit.I did just take it out again and I was noticeably better with maintaining control just after articulating the issues in this post but any feedback is great!I really like Mode  controls throttle on the left but spending time with this plastic one makes me think that a D joystick like my beloved Logitech Extreme D Pro going nearly  years strong with a separate throttle toggle would be great for flying multicopters. While not at all practical in the field with obvious formfactor issues AFAIK theres a huge benefit in separating out the throttle from the yaw in that you can more finely control both but that theres no chance that you can adjust the throttle when yawing and you can precisely adjust both at the same time. One stick forward and back for pitch side to side to roll twist to yaw and separate throttle toggleslider to set and adjust. Plus you could have primary and secondary triggers and even a hat switch on top of the stick. Is there anything like this out there?So another quick follow up question if you dont mind does one experience the same sort of drifting and dipping issues with flight controllers like the MultiWii? APM? CCD? Im thinking about going with MultiWii and I believe from the wiki that it has a compass and barometer so should be able to pretty much hover in one spot or no?Thanks again for your advice it is really appreciated. I am super excited to get into ALL of it my brother and I are already starting to talk about D modelingprinting and it seems like a fantastic community by and large.

3573818,0,t1_cpzmddc,Thats a huge overrange. The defaults for the FAILSAFE feature consider anything lower than  or higher than  to be an invalid input which triggers the failsafe to activate so youll need to either tune those settings failsafeminusec and failsafemaxusec or disable the FAILSAFE feature.When your throttle is below mincheck youre doing stick commands like arm and disarm and above it you are flying. You want to set mincheck the lowest you can to maximise the amount of stick that youre actually flying with while not setting it so low that you cant reliably perform stick commands. So you should probably set mincheck to like . Maxcheck only comes into play while disarmed and the default should be fine for you.Unfortunately the FC will consider  to be the top of your throttle range no matter what and this isnt tuneable. So the  on your stick will all be at maximum throttle no change in response.Now all that said you should absolutely be able to just fix the range that your DXi is putting out and not have to deal with any of these problems. From what I read on the web you need to enter ADJUST menu then TRAVEL ADJUST and set the percentage endpoints of your channels appropriately. Just keep bringing them in until you reach the right range being displayed on the receiver tab. Use the subtrim to ensure your channels centre on .,Multicopter,cpzn5ok,1,t5_2u9hy

3629195,0,t1_cq5wrhv,Thats a question DJI needs to answer but I suspect their answer is their whole marketdifferentiation is to make flying turnkey for anyone.As far as I can tell until DJI started requiring firmware upgrades most nontechnical phantom users didnt even really realize they could hook up to a computer and do all kinds of great FC tuning... No real PID adjustment like cleanflight or whatever but a lot...  By default the controller which has a three throw switch is set to GPS ATTI ATTI... yes ATTI twice. I suspect many phantom owners dont poke around in software and realize the P had a manual setting. Also... Manual is NO sensors No stabilization... So besides the lack of GPS it really is doesnt even have the basic stabilization of a gyro that KKs have. I learned to fly oldschool and have flown collective pitch helis so Im used to literally controlling it totally myself but that isnt really the problem DJI is trying to solve. So I think its not default because DJI doesnt want that... However I do think it would be smart to document it more and for the community to continue telling pilots to learn manual even many of the new  pilots I see use Stabilize more which is NOT really full manual... Also... My current experience is with a P... DJI exposed a lot more settings to users then. For instance I can descend as fast as I like I dont have the ft a sec limit Ps have... There is a good possibility that DJI may have removed the manual FC setting from the FC software for Ps?  You need a P user to confirm that.,Multicopter,cq5yffu,1,t5_2u9hy

But as soon as there was even a light breeze it would move around a lot and altitude hold was pretty poor. I was advised by dr to turn down my RCFeel setting which is supposedly supposed to filter your control inputs and make it fly smoother. I went from  down to  at their advice. Though no one could tell me exactly what the setting did. After moving down to  it did fly better but I then had two crashes where it seemed like the autolevel got messed up and it thought a  angle was level. So it locked into that angle and even me giving full opposite stick would not return it to level. So twice I had to just lower the throttle and let it skid in.

3743100,0,t1_cqi0eig,I am a builder and have had this debate with many other builders. I have done the math breaking the  minute barrier starts getting quite expensive. It is cheaper to have more batteries on hand than longer flight times. The motors batteries and props to start getting over the  minute are quite pricey. And when you crash and ruin  worth of high mah batteries it hurts. I have sold over  quads and Hexs based on Tarot frames. Most of my rigs have gone to land survey and the film industry and after feed back from customers their average flight is less then  minutes at a time. In the film industry it is less than  minutes in the air for a shot.So i guess I am asking are you building to test the limits of flight times or looking to use this in a practical way like facility security or other purpose.

3852769,0,t1_cqulg83,Alright Im going to take a crack at this.  Warning I may ramble.  I apologize in advance! PBatteries store charge.  Charge per time is current Amperes.  A batterys capacity is measured in amphours or milliamphours which is the measure of how many amps or milliamps the battery can supply for one hour to go from  stateofcharge SOC to  SOC.  For instance  I have a couple mAh batteries.  That means they can supply .A of current for  hour.  A S mAh battery can still supply . amps for one hour the main difference being that they have different terminal voltage and thus a different power content.  This is the magic Crate number that you hear so often.Back on track  The battery no matter what can only supply a certain voltage or thereabouts.  It cannot go up or down.  The ESC helps it go down from the motors perspective which lessens the torque set up on the motor shaft and thus lessens the amount of current draw from the motor different story about motors and electrical machines but a brief overview is helpful.  Now when your motor wants to turn that prop the motor needs to produce a certain amount of power  Watts  to turn the prop and keep you aloft.  That wattage or power production is what you were getting at with your equal power systems comment you were close to the mark there.  Power watts is volts  amps you probably knew that.  However where the S vs S setup really makes a difference is by how much power it can produce in a motor.  The difference here is not due to just the voltage being higher and the comment above about hightension systems while the right idea! is not the same concept that has to do with resistive coronal and inductive losses over huge stretches of suspended polyphase cable.  Where S wins out is that not only will your motors spin faster giving you more top end on your speed and a better throttle resolution it enables your motor to produce more power using the same current.  The equation P  IV makes this evident.  It really just enables you to have a biggerhigher top end.Because the motors themselves dont see the DC voltagecurrent from the battery directly but rather through the pseudopolyphase output of an ESC they dont directly notice it they just know that theyre being told to spin at a certain rate by the incoming voltage and signal and they suck down more current to maintain that speed.  When you get faster and require more power to accelerate faster and turn harder your motors can produce more power with less current by increasing the voltage again due to P  IV.  What that means for you is that you can choose a very high KV motor and stick it on S and get the same output speeds for the props and the same thrust as a lower KV motor on S with the same props at the same speed.  Whats better is that that thrust takes a certain amount of electrical power development in the motor which roughly obeys P  IV which means that the S will take about  more current than a S would which translates to less flight time think back to the first paragraph about charge! and probably a morestressed battery your battery has a crate limit for a reason.So I realize that kinda turned into a wallotext and I apologize if I rambled at times.  Electricity is complicated and awesome and I really like talking about things that I thought Id never use again since I didnt go into power distribution after university P  Hope I helped!,Multicopter,cqvg8rz,7,t5_2u9hy

3856377,0,t3_34lgux,The good news is that its Friday and you hopefully? have SatSunday to search.  A long time ago I flew my quad into the trees and it took me  days to find it even though I had a very small search perimeter.  Trees and grass EAT quads.  They just disappear!Pull up Google maps and start thinking about your search perimeter and search plan for tomorrow.  In my case Azimuth and distance were integral to finding my quad. gtI had a cell tracker on it but it turns out that particular area has no cell coverage. I live on the East Coast next to one of the biggest cities in the country.  And yet in my house in my yard and about half the street street I get ZERO cell phone signal with every cell phone provider.  People think these dead spots are rare but theyre not.  Cell phone towers are optimized for highly populated areas and arteries like highways.  If you get out into some fields its dead spots galore.  I would much rather be searching  foot pattern with LoctorMarco Polo than rely on cell phone signals and gps signals.  At least with Marco Polo I know the signal is there to be found.  All the best.

3863993,0,t1_cqwpz3i,Youll be glad you got it.  Grab a couple spare batteries because flight time is short.   Id also look into a decent charger so you get more play time.  This one is my favorite for the S micros.You may find range a bit short on the stock radio.  When the money starts to burn a hole in your wallet go for a pro radio next.  If you can afford it go for the Taranis.  Slap an OrangeRX module in it so it can talk DSM and youll find that your Nano has suddenly become a whole new quad.  Also gives you the time to tinker and get over the hump of learning a programmable radio before you build.  And that is how the addiction starts...EDIT  Just saw you got the Lectrons.  They claim mah but its BS as they are exactly the same size and weight as the stock .  You get what you pay for with those.   BUT they do fly and have similar flight times as the stock batt.

I added a couple .wav files to me Tarannis so I flipped a switch and Flash Gordon started playing wooo! I gave it some gas and marveled at its speed. Brought it back around about  ft above me and all of a sudden it looked like Flash Gordon ejected from the quad. Sadly it was the propeller launching off into the stratosphere and THX E came plummeting out of the sky onto the concrete. I put my props on backwards the first time so when I switched em around I only hand tightened them for a quick test hover I got excited and forgot to tighten them down.

3958560,0,t3_35rwl7,Well your biggest challenge is going to be the battery and control system requirements...FRC rules say the only power source is that stupid V battery that weighs like  pounds... Then you have to use the roboRIO which is a LOT lighter than the cRIO luckily and the PDB is pretty bulky also.Luckily the TalonsJaguarsVictors can dump a LOT of current more than most of the ESCs that multicopters use so you can get by with beefier motors. Speaking of motors what motors could we use? FRC rules are pretty limited on motor choices...CIM motors are great tons of torque and a good RPM but really heavy. Maybe some of the Fisher Price motors might work better get lots of RPM. Of course those can overheat pretty quickly...Finally the safety requirements...

I moved to powering the whole board from v and it worked well after that.On my  I have the nucleus PDB which nicely integrates with a normal size MinimOSD.  Its a thing of beauty and I use MWmod firmware which gives me features like PID tuning right from an on screen menu.  I can land my quad then use stick commands to make adjustments to PIDs or other things like RC rateexpo then Im off flying again without having to take my goggles off.  I use the voltage from the Naze to judge battery life.  There are ways to get actual current usage but they were more work that I didnt think was worth it.  The OSD will also give you the low voltage warning based on your Naze settings so its impossible to miss.,Multicopter,creemam,1,t5_2u9hy
4019694,0,t1_credurq,this is right on the money. vtx are made to be super small but also really powerful. They need the antenna to dissipate and absorb the energy output. If you dont have the antenna on you will very quickly fry most transmitters. The antenna works as a resistor and converts the output energy into transmitted RF energy. Without the antenna the energy has nowhere to go but to be converted to heat. Heat bad...make transmitter no workie....at least thats what Ive read.On a high frequency circuit you have always  parts source transmition line and load. The load must be properly adapted to the line. The load here is the antenna.Not having the antenna will cause a reflection that depending the distance to the source could cause a peak amplitude wave that can destroy the source.,Multicopter,creh4u4,1,t5_2u9hy

Anything D printable is going to be just that redesigned and printed by anyone with a cheap D printer at home and used without your knowledge. It is a great idea the adapters it really is. But i dont think you can make a business out of it little own a kickstarter campaign. What do you need to kickstart? the only thing i can think of is mass production which people arnt going to be willing to pay for when they can wait a little pay someone  they know with a D printer for them.

Purely because they could.That all being said if you do go ahead with it i hope it pans out for you and you make a bucket load because i do believe in paying money to the person who did the RampD for a product.goodluck. ,Multicopter,crgsmji,1,t5_2u9hy

4043727,0,t3_36ua30,What do you use the Quad for?I went with the Phantom  for a couple reasons HD Stream to cell phone or tablet. I really wanted the immersion that goes with flying and I tried fat sharks and FPV screens and the low resolution was just not immersive enough. I have a Go Pro Hero  Black but the FOV on the P Camera is better for aerial shots. I wasnt expecting a lot from it because they just simply didnt have a name for themselves in the camera world. After using it quite a bit  I think its a very capable camera. Obviously not cinema ready lol but itll do the job for some entry level professional photography and videography. I wanted a machine that I could pop in a backpack I ride a motorcycle and take anywhere with ease while still allowing me to take professional level photo and video. This fit the bill perfectly basically a mini DJI InspireAs for fly aways I fortunately have not experienced it yet and hope I never do.I personally take the  extra minutes setting up for flight. I calibrate the compass pre flight every flight wait for as many satellites as Im going to get and take it slow. Ive flown other quads but i still think that in the amount of time it takes to recognize the fly away switch to a manual mode and regain control you may have already lost it.. I think if youre lucky enough to be allotted the proper time to recognize a fly away and have the skills to take control youll be fine but its like everything else the first time you experience it it will be totally unexpected and catch you off guard. It may be my own ignorance and misplacement of trust but I felt at the time of purchase and even more so now much more comfortable with a high tech quad like the P. The biggest thing for me was the application I dont know why. I think it was having all of the information in an easy to read format rather than trusting that the remote and quad were in good constant communication. Its Just reaffirmation of what I see and know.,Multicopter,crh7s4m,1,t5_2u9hy

Checking Armattan page again its only rated for  amps and if you saw size of trace even that sounds very generous.  Few other people have had this failure.  Armattan now has a new PDB board but I had already gotten this one from multirotormaniaIt is .g and they claim a continuous which should be more than enough.  So far no issues with S.

4055027,0,t3_36zfa5,Want to be extra frustrated?RPSMA was only created as a means of preventing individuals from putting aftermarket e.g. higher gain antennas on things like WiFi routers and causing issues in dense RF areas.  The idea was to use this backwards connection type to keep devices within FCC or similar limits since it couldnt be easily modified.  Only SMA was to be made available to consumers and used where aftermarket modification was allowed.No one thought that through.  Its legal to makebuysell RPSMA so of course manufacturers all made them since there is a market.

If you let a hubsan X get into a tumble it will  of the time crash and it will crash HARD into the ground after applying throttle. It really depends on the size and how the FC is tuned. I think some of the hubsan x clones might handle it better but I dont have any to test.A lot of these syma xc flips found here are a mixture of using the flip cut throttle tumble with a lot of momentum it will do forward and reverse momentum multi flips.,Multicopter,crkj7v9,1,t5_2u9hy

Down the road we will be releasing our FC for more platforms but right now all ESCs for a  sized quad is built into one board. The sensors can add a really fun flair to a typical FPV quad and down the road the codesensors that are made can be used in bigger platforms like our current Quark. Right now we are playing around with a laser tag emitter and receivers with our Eedus that really make it a fun game.

I put this off for a while because I couldnt wrap my head around it with the terminology the wiki used but once you get it its very easy to use. switch  position will be your control to adjust the setting selected by your second switch. The nd switch I use a potslider will be be how you select which setting you are currently adjusting. For each setting you want to adjust you will use a new line in cleanflight with the only difference being the range you set and the option. Their wording for using slots is confusing and slots arent really needed with the taranis. Slots are better for people who dont have a slider and they want to control more than the  optionsranges their switch gives them.Try this videoHere is a photo of how I have it setupAs you can see the only thing that changes is the range option. Each different range corresponds to a different setting.

4377105,0,t1_csj0lm7,Higher KV motors are more suited for racingacro multirotors where maneuverability is the primary goal and those frames are usually much smaller and lighter mm or less. Granted for a racing quad youd want to go even higher than . KV is sort of higher than what youd want for an all around cruiser the size youre building and lower than what youd want for an allout racing quad on a smaller frame. Larger props spinning more slowly will be more stable and efficient for the larger allaround setup youre going for.The motors will produce the same amount of thrust if the prop size is correctly matched. While the top speed of the higher KV motor is theoretically higher also depends on the props and other factors the difference just isnt worth the trade offs in your case.  If youre after speed build a racing multirotor IMO.Edited with more info.,Multicopter,csj1abu,1,t5_2u9hy

4404418,0,t1_csm0ohz,gt has its limitsthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringedSince there hasnt been an amendment to that amendment technically you are suppose to be able to own a warship privately with cannons and shit like the founding fathers did.We dont have to guess their intentions they literally owned the weapons of war and lent them to the Army to use in fights. When the war was over most of the continental armies arms went back home with their private owners. In fact the actual government supplied equipment was measurably worse that what was privately available government has muskets and private citizens had rifles. The government had a few shitty ships private citizens acing as privateers sailed ships of the line into battle.And so on and so forth. Its only after WWII that the government has had better arms than its citizens though quite a few grease guns did make it home.Also fun fact an arm in this case refers to anything at all that can be used as a weapon. Raising arms against an aristocrat was a crime that could include anything from a rock or stick to a sword or bow. The right to bear arms literally means the right to own weapons of war or hunting or anything in between. The reason was so you couldnt get arrested for just holding a stick a common bullshit legal tactic at the time that the founding fathers were so sick of they were willing to die for it.Its not like the founding fathers were illiterate they chose specific working intentionally they didnt use arms because it sounded fancy for musket. They didnt say shall not be infringed because they though it meant unless you really feel otherwise. Either they really really meant it when they wrote that amendment or they were blithering idiots either way the system for changing that rule has never been sufficiently respected.The modern interpretation while admittedly more sane and rational in its intentions ignores the process we use to create and maintain our laws undermining the very government you want to take more control.Conservatives do the same damn thing with the abortion debate.Same thing when the FAA issues memos and suggestions in the form of regulations...Until we agree to actually follow the rules of democracy these kind of issues will always be a decisive issue with no peaceful outcome.Im actually for gun control but the proper way is to deal directly with the second amendment that way the entire country in on board and Im not actively working to make illegally taking away rights even easier just to get my way.,Multicopter,csm42lu,4,t5_2u9hy

Luxfloat got me square so I havent even bothered trying Harakiri. Also when you have a long list of projects other shit gets pushed aside. I will say from all I have read Harakiri is definitely a competitor for Luxfloat as it seems pretty evenly divided on who likes which.

If your naze is shipped with baseflight it takes  seconds to put cleanflight on it I use cleanflight on the Naze myself. I know it sounds like a daunting task to flash new firmware but it is incredibly easy to do.The problem I had with the dragonfly came about when I tried to hook up an OSD and the pins were not in the usual spot and I had an extra hard time figuring it out. Save yourself the hassle and just get a Naze. Also I was using an Overcraft PDB similar to the Nucleus PDB and the pins on the PDB matched up better with the pins on the naze than the dragonfly saving some clutter.,Multicopter,csras6n,1,t5_2u9hy

Its a class B airspace around KPIT which I am not sure if the park is within but the altitude limits wouldnt really matter from where they are at because they are well under the altitude limits there.  If they were up around K they would have to have communications with ATC  a working TCAS transponder and  direct given clearance.  But as there is no chance of this drone getting there nothing really to worry about really.

4647294,0,t1_ctgaaaw,Hopefully youre referring to voltage drops not voltage spikes and that adding capacitors to the input would give more capacitance to avoid them not reduce the voltage PBut at the same time Im tempted to disagree. I work in the electronics feild aswell and much as I dont work directly with RC stuff or brushless motors I cant help but wonder why you think added length between the ESC leads and the battery is an inappropriate solution.The ESC has input capacitors to dampen the PWM current loading the output motor leads you have no opportunity to account for their series resistive losses to the motor because you cant put capacitors there as its switched at high speed. The ESC itself has to read back EMF over these leads aswell to calculate motor position which will be effected by having longer leads though likely not an issue again unless you make them several meters long.If the ESC power leads were considerably long with illsuited wire too high of a gauge for instance then I can definitely see the voltage sag being a considerable phenomenon but most ESC power leads are thicker then your motor leads anyhow. Or at least mine are the ESC is a bit overkill.But then again were talking under a meter of cable length anyhow.

On s and s they perform great but to make use of the power they give you from being a newbie means you may wreck them before you can make use of them.I have the TMotor  kv on my Highend racing quad However this was mostly due to impatience to wait for the RCX motors check them out they are really good and the Cobras being out of stock everywhere. The quality is exceptional and it is scary how easily they can swing a  inch prop.To answer your question be honest and ask yourself what you want to do. Park flying DYS? racing? DYS or SS and if you want to pull of some disgusting speed then the Tigers may work but there are alternatives. ,Multicopter,ctidk7t,5,t5_2u9hy

4718446,0,t1_ctpadgn,See I have an issue with drone not that multirotors are called drones. But that the public ONLY refers to multirotors as drones now. But the media is calling everything a drone. So the RC airplanes that have been happily flying around since the s without incidents are now going to be forced to follow the same rulesbans that could be brought on by all the drone coverage.I think if you showed a gas balsa airplane to  of the public they wouldnt give a shit. But if you show them a quadcopter  they will be like oh thats a drone i hear those are bad. The media is perpetuating this drone negativity by calling everything a drone. For instance  years ago people may have been flying slope gliders when a wildfire started and the fire aircraft may have had to notify them to stop. But no one really cared and no media made a deal of it. Now when that happens the media jumps on drone and its going to put more negative light on multicopters when its not even a multicopter or a new form of aircraft thats causing the issue. IE by calling everything a drone the media is painting multicopters and rc in a bad light which will lead to more regulations and bans when they are unneeded.

In fact the UK link I posted actually calls it the nighthawk kit.Good catch! After a second read the UK version does NOT include a PDB. The Amazon link however pictures a generic PDB that should work well for beginners. If you check out the ZMR kit uregretfulpath posted added to my post I would get a Diatone  or Kunai UBAD  PDB which actually replaces a piece of the CF frame.

I imagine itll be pretty slow at high resolutions but speed would be the least of my concerns.Im impressed with the design and the fundamental advantages in their design. Even more impressed with how the guys are handling the kickstarter campaign. They started manufacturing early before the campaign money was even released  to meet the extraordinary demand. They improved a few parts and sourced better components instead of pocketing extra funds. They even turned down the opportunity to take preorders and did so in order to focus on fulfilling kickstarter orders more quickly while ensuring quality control is up to snuff. They seem genuine.

They normally break a fan blade when a bird is interested in the engine and that fan blade collides with another and so on causing a cascading failure. Jet engines ARE designed to protect the rest of the plane from fan blades that break off. Otherwise bird ingestion would kill everyone on board. I dont know how often the engine is completely ruined after a bird strike but its definitely a bad situation. I suspect ingesting a quadcopter would do the same thing.However a quad might be more dangerous when striking a windshield or other parts of the plane.

Two cameras I have used quite a bit from Surveilzone the larger Sony EffioV board cam and the mini super HAD both behave fairly differently. The EffioV had a great picture but was prone to noise the cam itself had slightly observable latency but not enough to notice while flying. Now the mini super HAD better form factor but the picture is just not quite as nice there is definitely less latency with this camera compared to the effiov but I notice somewhat of a stutter in the picture almost like the framerate is not as high Im starting to wonder if this could be vibrations affecting the sensor.,Multicopter,cudhzpg,2,t5_2u9hy

4981988,0,t1_culpr96,gtThen what would be the recommended first FPV serious camera drone?It depends on what you want to do in the hobby. If you want a racer Id strongly suggest building your own. If you want to do AP Ill have to defer to someone else because thats not my area of expertise.gtare FPV cameras always low quality to provide transmission speed? Or are people just mounting two cameras to get good quality first person footage?I think your or should be an and because both of your hunches are correct. Racers use analog low quality video links because high definition digital systems introduce too much latency. Some of the aerial photography guys use digital links which is fine for them because they can tolerate more lag without crashing. The second camera on a racer is there to capture high definition footage for use later on.,Multicopter,cumiima,3,t5_2u9hy

5132655,0,t3_3l992o,This is a complicated question.  In theory they should have comparable torque.  When you size a brushless motor the torque is proportional to D x L diameter squared times the length.  If calculate this out you get  x    and  x   .  So in that respect the two motors are basically equivalent ... you should expect to get about the same torque out of both motors assuming all other things are equal. Note Usually all things are NOT equal.  I dont know the specifics of each motor but the number of slots and poles can have an effect the size of wire that can fit in the slots can effect this the total amount of wire they can fit in the slots etc.Cooling Motor performance is highly dependent on cooling.  A shorter bigger diameter motor will have more surface area which means it should stay cooler.  Length A shorter motor generally means you can have a smaller air gap which helps performance.  Whether this is the case between the Cobra and DYS I dont know.  Quality A better quality motor generally holds tighter tolerances which can mean better performance.  For example tighter tolerances can mean you can have a smaller air gap and again better performance.  I dont know if that is the case here but it is a possibility.,Multicopter,cv4od3k,2,t5_2u9hy

While landscapes and open fields or flying though the trees seems cool to the majority of people like us its not that cool to everyone else...It all comes down to how we can relate to the subject matter just like all art if it doesnt capture you you really dont care about it. you can appreciate it but if you cant relate it to yourself in some way you tend to ignore it. When we see UAVs flying over highways over stadiums over festivals and events its because its what people see everyday but from a ground perspective. when you stick a camera on a UAV they have a whole new perspective about the world around them and it intrigues them.

5230076,0,t3_3mn26s,Dont cut any wires before measuring three times then cut a tad longer. Learn to solder if you dont know already. Good technique takes time but you can get good results by having a good station like the digial Hakko using high temps like f going in and out in less than  secs pre tinning using good solder containing at least  lead and rosin core. ,Multicopter,cvgeymw,1,t5_2u9hy

5243108,0,t3_3mqwed,Typically for FPV you would have a camera and a video transmitter to send out the signal.  Then you would have a receiver and a monitor or goggles to pickup and view the signal.  Some goggles will have a built in receiver.  The equipment should say which bands and frequencies they cover so just make sure the transmitter and receiver can cover some of the same bands and frequencies.Adding FPV may complicate the power system a little though.  Make sure you understand that you cannot attach a V camera directly to the battery power of a s lipo without putting a V voltage regulator in between to stepdown the voltage to a steady V.  If its a V camera you would naturally need a V regulator.,Multicopter,cvhzfdq,1,t5_2u9hy

5248313,0,t3_3mw0be,the two antennas offer some diversity in that they both output the same signal but cover more area than a single wire could allowing you better reception compared to a single wire. you can probably fly the thing just fine with one.  i love those ipx connections they make repairs a lot easier.,Multicopter,cvilzod,2,t5_2u9hy
5249066,0,t1_cviot2f,I feel the same way and youve been a great help to others on this thread I thought you might be interested.I had the same thought about mixes. I had two set up s amp s for it and tried the other same result but Ill try a brand new mix just in case. with tons of trim I can get something close to stable for a second or two then it seems to drift further and overshoot it.Im with you it seems like it would be an FC issue but I test flew the new FC on an old quad before swapping it out and it was working properly. Deductive reasoning makes me think it HAS to be something to do with vibration and the differences in motor vib is definitely worth looking at.

5316175,0,t1_cvr71w1,Oh my bad for not clarifying. I was referring to the quads lipo battery when I said lipo. Those batteries should read .V since from what I see the CX should only be S one cell.As for the AA batteries rechargeable ones always hold a lower voltage than nonrechargeable ones .V. .V sounds like a healthy new AA rechargeable battery though so the only thing I would say is to try nonrechargeable batteries usually .V like you said. The thing youre describing sounds like what happens to my Hubsan when the transmitter is dying  I dont think its the batteries though .V is usually plenty but its worth a try before moving on to making it a transmitter problem.,Multicopter,cvr7cmr,1,t5_2u9hy

5330054,0,t3_3o00zj,If there has been no crash or any other unusual mechanical stress likely causes of failure are the winding insulation mostly cheap motors these small motors take a ridiculous amount of current by normal standards and produce a lot of heat and of course the bearings. Be sure to take good care of the bearings and lubricate them regularly as advised by the manufacturer.

I generally fly with others and with noobs so I always like to have a lot of backup gear to loan to someone or in case I run out.

5491110,0,t1_cwd958s,If I were in your position Id do this Phase   Buy a cheap toy you can fly indoors Hubsan X Nano QX and Syma XC all well recommended Phase   Buy a Taranis transmitter and a cheap flight simulator FPVfreerider if you want to fly FPV Phase   Build something you know how to fix later crash it Phase   Many optionsId highly recommend watching RCModelReviews  racer build series. Bruce explains how to put a budget  racer quad together showing every part connection and joint.   Electrohub build video. This is a  size quad that would be a good start if you are more interested in aerial photography. The electronic concepts will apply very well to other frames.  You really really want to start on a toy quad and learn how to crash that. This can save you hundreds of dollars. Most everyone on here has a story about landing a quad into a pond having it run over by a car or getting it stuck in a tree. It happens to everyone and youd rather it happen to a  toy then a  high end racer.Recommended starter quads Hubsan x HL  Popular indoor trainer quad. Watch where it ships from many sellers on Amazon. Nano QX RTF  Well featured higher end retail quad. This is one of the few retail quads you can buy that have the option to turn autoleveling off. If you want to do acro tricks you really should start with this one. Flies well indoors. Syma XC  Popular outdoor trainer quad.Building might not be super easy but is very worth it.

If you have a point of reference to compare against it becomes much easier to do so however stuff like  sized quads zipping around dont really move slow enough to have a solid point of reference especially if the only thing behind it from your POV is the sky.  Keep at it and youll start getting more used to the craft in general your internal clock will start getting used to oh X seconds at Y throttle with Z amount of pitch gets me about A distance and stuff like that suddenly having flashbacks to my first car manual with a tachometer but speedometer was broken eventually just learned X RPM while in Y gear is Z speed and never worried about it again.Or just do FPV seems to be the thing these days lol.,Multicopter,cwgjr40,2,t5_2u9hy

EVERYTHING you say is a big IF based on a fear AKA FUD.gt You will not be required to register every aircraft individually. You only need to register yourself and can affix one registration number to all your aircraft.Its not a fear someone is going to frame me its a loophole in a pointless system that renders the entire system pointless. What good does the registration system do now?  Ive worked in the antifraud and counterfeiting business for  years if you think people arent going to steal these numbers then you are being naive.

5959176,0,t1_cxzjgos,I would say requiring you to register each individual aircraft is definitely a form a regulation. They are using emergency powers to say that drones are suddenly dangerous and need to be registered. Their are much more capable aircraft already in existence and have existed for much longer than the  years quadcopter have existed for. You could fly a rd model plane into an airport  years ago just the same as you can fly a phantom that weighs less than  pounds. The laws seem like a money grab and a way to increase the power of the FAA. It break their own rules. Does it not scare anyone else when the government decides to break their own rules and expect no one to do anything about it? Its a scary place when the laws start to mean nothing.,Multicopter,cy0s1nz,1,t5_2u9hy

6061457,0,t3_3yht70, When i started out i thought i wanted to do nice video. Bought a Naza and gimbal an a Camera and all the accessories. I took it out a few times and got incredibly bored. You go up put the throttle at  and it stays there. Then i saw videos of people doing acro so i started trying to learn on my Naza. Yes you can flip a  quad with a naza but you need to be pretty high and the gimbal will freak out. So I thought i would use my extra parts and build a  with a ccd. It was much easier to flip but when it hit the ground stuff broke and that stuff was expensive. Then i built a  and started fpv racing then another  and soon to be another. I havent really touched my bigger quads this year and I am most likely gonna sell them off in January and continue with my little fleet. Now i just slap my Gopro on my zmrs and have fun. Build something cheap like a zmr but buy a good remote and goggles if your gonna fpv. It is a lot easier and cheaper to crash a  .

Their test rigs were pretty much toothpicks holding separate a HV wire and a foil skirt. When voltage is applied these little things jump and flutter about. Pretty cool stuff.

My point is not that you shouldnt fly in your backyard if youre close to an airport staying low to the ground etc. My point is the rule should be written to say that if youre flying over  feet in the air within  miles you need to notify the tower.

Are you using the correct  way switch?  There are two on the TX and one is not configured to do anything.  Does the light on the PDBESCFC board change when you switch modes?I had problems switching modes after setting mine up for my DXi.  The DXi only has  position switches and I was trying to set it up using heli mode on the TX.  I tried some interesting mixing settings to get the switch configuration that I wanted and it wasnt switching modes.  I had it set up to switch between horizon and acro mode and the light would change on the board but it wouldnt change modes.  Like uRaider said check the setup in baseflight.  You can change the modes while its connected and see if it is actually doing what it supposed to be doing.  The  deal was awesome.

6470122,0,t1_cznrn7e,The problem about taking corners with quadcopters in comparison to cars is that its comparatively a lot safer to overshoot than to undershoot whereas with cars its the complete opposite.In a car you can always push the inside line but have the opportunity to move outside if you push too far in. Therefore lines tend to be as tight as they can get to the inside on the apex of the corner. However in a quadcopter pushing the apex of the corner means that if you accidentally push too much inside your race is over since you cant feasibly correct and crash right into the flag. On the other hand if you overshoot all you do is add a little more angle and a little more throttle to correct.Most drone races still end up in crashes so its a lot safer to have a very large safety margin and round the outside of corners using the full potential power of your quadcopter and keeping speeds up than it is to cut as close to the flags as possible.Keep in mind that the theoretically fastest line through a hairpin flag after a straight involves flipping the quadcopter  degrees before you even reach the flag to brake and passing the flag in reverse under hard acceleration which means you have zero vision while doing so unless you have a tiltrotor or camera gimbal.,Multicopter,czok1o0,3,t5_2u9hy

7066446,0,t3_4ccvlk,A battery is similar to a tank of gas.  Both store a certain amount of energy that is available for use to turn into useful work.  The energy that a battery can store is measured in Watthours.  Energy is power Watts times time hours.  If a battery had  Watthours of energy in it then it could provide  Watts of power for  hour or  Watt of power for  hours.  Power is voltage times current when we are talking about electricity and power is speed RPM times torque Newtonmeters when we are talking about mechanical rotation.  The motor converts electrical power into mechanical power.  A lot of people use the analogy of water in a pipe to help them understand electrical terms.  Voltage is like a water pump.  A pump takes in low pressure water and spits out high pressure water.  A voltage source like a battery takes in low voltage charge and spits out high voltage charge.  The flow of water in the pipes is like electric current.  Because electrical power is just voltage times current that means that the higher your voltage source the less current you need to get the same power.  In Lipo batteries like the ones used for quadcopters voltage is usually specified by the number of cells the battery has.   cell batteries are called s  cell batteries are called s  cell batteries are s and so on.  The s just means that those batteries are connected in series and their voltages are added together.  Usually we say that a nominal voltage for  cell is . Volts but in reality it will vary depending on how the battery is charged how much current the battery is sourcing how hot the battery is etc.  Batteries are also rated for how much current they provide at any given time.  Batteries will have a mAh rating and a C rating.  mAh rating is similar to the Watthour rating above.  A  mAh battery will be able to provide  milliamps for  hours or  milliamps  Amp for  hour or  milliamps  Amps for . hours.  This is sometimes called the capacity of the battery.  It tells you about the total current the battery can provide over time.  The C rating on the other hand tells you how much current a battery can provide at any given instant.  Lets say you have a  mAh battery with C rating of C.  You take the capacity in Amphours not milliamphours and multiply it by C to get the maximum current the battery can provide.  So for this example  Amphour x  C   Amps.  Its a little more complicated than that once you start looking into it but thats basically what it means.  The higher the C rating more current your battery is going to be able to provide at any given time and the more powerful it is going to feel.  In general a higher mAh rating means longer flight times and a higher C rating means a punchier more powerful feeling quadcopter.  RC motors take the voltage and current and convert it to mechanical power speed times torque.  The bigger the motor is physically the more powerful it will be.  Motors usually have to be matched with the battery ESCs and the props.  These items make up the quadcopters power system and they all work together so they need to be matched.  Bigger props need more torque to spin them but dont need as much speed to make the same amount of thrust as smaller props.  Smaller props need to spin faster than bigger props but dont need as much torque from the motor to make them spin.The Kv constant of a motor is a useful figure of merit that tells you how fast the motor will spin for every volt you apply to the motor.  For a beginner like yourself all you really need to know is that if you take Kv and multiply it by the voltage you apply to the motor you get roughly the speed the motor will spin if it has no load on it.  Its more complicated than that though and if you want to read about it I wrote a blog post a while ago explaining Kv in detail  Keep in mind the brushless and brushed motors slow down when load them so adding a prop to a motor can slow it down quite a bit below noload speed.The Kv constant of motors has nothing to do with the motors power or size.  You could have a  Kv motor that is small or big.  Its only use is to help in picking out the right props and battery voltages.  A big prop on a high Kv motor that is small will overheat quickly.

7168027,0,t1_d1sw9q3,Ha.  I like your lootime typo.  Looptime is an unfortunate remnant of arduino legacy.  I left a friendly comment on one of their bugs where they were trying to introduce a scheduling system to mix into their big loop.  I was referencing a paper titled Avoiding the Top  Embedded Software Risks since the discussion was about introducing one of them in addition to others that are already there.In dRonin theres IMU update frequency which fires interrupts back to the RTOS and theres various actuator code.  If you run Oneshot with a reasonably high IMU update frequency you get from a control perspective a low looptime.We dont pay attention to those though.  Its only a metric of how much stuff is happening in the software with no regard to what the flight needs are.  It also leads to people trying to do obscene things to get looptimes to approach zero.  In dRonin you actually measure the response of the system which includes not only flight controller hardware and software efficiency but also the ESC hardware and software motors props battery weight balance etc...  The tuning is the sum of all that but the most interesting metric tau is the speed it takes for the software to observe a change in rotation it actuates.e.g. if Im level and ask a motor to speed up to cause me to start rotation how long does it take for me to observe that rotation?  From this you can learn all kinds of fun things.  e.g. you can quantify how much turning on comppwm in SimonK or damped light in blheli makes in real control authority.  You can measure how much authority you lose by switching to higher pitched props the motors have a harder time changing the speed of.  You no longer have voodoo where people tell you quadrupling the IMU update frequency looptime makes your flying better but you can clearly see that the returns are diminishing and once you hit the theoretical limit I cant remember exactly where that is but somewhere around ms youre trying to make software respond faster than the hardware is physically capable.If you build an aircraft that has a ms system response which is very good and you put some time and money into making it a lot better you might hit  or ms which is better though beyond my ability to even notice.  Once you get down to like ms you now have to deal more with fluid dynamics and other realworld crap to gain more authority.  Sending a oneshot pulse takes like S give or take.  People are trying to solve that problem by getting it below S.  Its unclear what value is expected by emitting  different signals before being able to detect the results of them.Ignoring how long it takes for your brain to send a message to your hand in the first place  id rather people focused on more reliable signaling than faster.  s.bus is super popular and is really a rather gross protocol.  All ESC communication is gross and insanely error prone.But yeah science.    Sorry for the ramble.,Multicopter,d1sxqn3,1,t5_2u9hy

7571749,0,t1_d32pl0h,Just to expand on urotarypower great answer.Vibration affects tuning. Think about if you were trying to shoot a basketball through a basket. Which would be harder? Doing it normally or doing it in an earthquake? The more vibration there is in the copter the harder the FC has to work.Cleanflight  betaflight has a lowpass filter in it to help deal with vibration. This is exactly like the treble setting on your audio player. Turn down the treble and you filter out the high frequencies and let the low frequencies through. This is helpful for the FC because vibration is very high frequency say  Hz to  Hz roughly on a multirotor whereas the copters actual motions are lower frequency say less than  Hz. So in theory a perfect lowpass filter would get rid of the noise while still letting the copter respond to stick inputs perfectly.Filtering creates delay. This is just a mathematical fact and there is no way around it. Some filters create more delay and some create less delay but there is always some delay. The harder you filter the signal the more delay there is. Delay is bad because it means that the PID loop is responding to information that is not fresh. This is especially relevant in very rapidly changing situations such as propwash occurring during a very sharp  turn at high speed. So less delay is better for copter handling. But less delay means less filtering means more noise means worse flight characteristics. So there is actually a balance that needs to be struck.What Boris is saying in the release notes is that he believes that most copters out there can afford to have less filtering by default than used to be present because most copters have less vibration than they used to or the filtering has gotten better or some combination of that. But if your copter has a lot of vibration you need more filtering and you will have to accept more delay and worse handling.The real question is how do you know how much vibration your copter has and what the optimal level of filtering is for you but thats a harder question to answer in just a few paragraphs.,Multicopter,d32vd29,7,t5_2u9hy

Tailin hover getting a feel for throttle response and keeping it tail in for orientation and control  . Tailin hover sideways gentle rolling right and left.  Keeping control is the most important thing here  . Add in a little yaw at each side of the sideways movement to get a feel for forward flight  . Forward flight back and forth always turning away from me so as to note lose orientation  . Doing it the other way turning in at myself which was the most difficult.  Broke most of my parts during this time  . Figure eights!  This was a big point that summer and I remember it well.  Finally no more simple hovering I could cruise around the field!  .

No lights will blink until you flash the firmware then they will go back to almost normal. Much better yaw rate and acro! Note may need to edit config.h last I saw it was default for  motorsYou may have to flash the latest same firmware to the STM if the board is not recognized in future flashes. ,Multicopter,d4wcy35,1,t5_2u9hy

8618588,0,t3_4xh0qr,I think especially in the US the FPV retail market is quite heavily contested. If you just make a normal web store I think it will be hard to compete against the big players GetFPV RMRC etc as they will have a bigger selection likely better shipping rates more efficient warehousing etc. You need to do something unique e.g. you could only offer a small number of products that you know work well together write blog post  youtube videos on how to use them etc. provide really good customer support that make people want to come back and support you. Feel free to contact us regarding retailing our products we are in the process of signing up more retailers.Regarding the BrainFPV RE vs Naze comparison naturally we think RE is much better . The really unique feature about RE is the integrated fullgraphical OSD which is much nicer than the character based OSDs using the MAX chip minimosd etc. The Naze also uses a much slower processor F at MHz vs F at MHz on RE so it wont be able to run advanced flight code. E.g. if you run dRonin on Naze your gyro rate is limited to Hz vs .kHz on RE and due to limited memory you can only enable a few features at a time.We also think that dRonin overall provides a better user experience than BetaFlight. There is no need to use arcane command line commands you dont have to remember where e.g. UART is on your board when using the configurator it has a great autotune feature settings are automatically converted when upgrading to a new release etc.,Multicopter,d6ix8ql,2,t5_2u9hy

The wire and pad are so small that it doesnt take much time to heat the padwire so you can usually do it live. I put the wire in the through hole and heat up the wire and pad and add solder. It usually is fine if you do it fast enough. If you strip extra insulation and double back the wire you can also make it easier to use the through hole without it slipping out.,Multicopter,d7883yt,1,t5_2u9hy

Maybe this is a thing of the past.gt What do you currently do for work?I sold a business back in  and havent had a real job since.  My formal education is in Finance and I spent about  years on the institutional side of the financial sector Schwab Institutional Vanguard.  On the nonfinancial side I worked in sales as well as lead sales teams in the VP or Director of sales role.. and started a few businesses along the way and got lucky with one or two.While I have no formal education in any STEM related field I have taught myself Python HTML CSS PHP and LINUX.  For my own little projects I am comfortable building websites and programming Arduinos and flight controllers  at my current level of knowledge I would never feel comfortable calling myself a programmer.  I ALWAYS have to look things up or find similar projects I can manipulate for my own purposes.  I.E. I would not be able to create my own flight controller from scratch.

And as the other comment says youll want to check that the polarisation of the antennas are the same. Youll still get some signal if theyre not but it wont be anywhere near as good quality.Is this your first quadcopter ever? If so Id strongly recommend forgetting the big quads and FPV for now and just picking up something small like a Hubsan X. Whatever you fly first will be crashed a hundred times and the little toy grade ones will stand up to the punishment and wont be a huge loss if you break it.I wouldnt want some kind of protection board in between the battery and the quad. In the worst case scenario I would much rather over discharge and kill a battery than have my quad drop out of the sky when it may not be safe to do so.

Just gotta use some like stickytack to jam in around the lens to hold it in place.And yeah I dunno fly far away and zoom in for a shaky shot or dont zoom in and have it look tiny..

9933105,0,t3_5hr5pd,Spend a little bit and get an unbreakable frame. Im not familiar with yours so I apologize if yours is already carbon fiber and very tough.Now as someone who started this hobby back when kk and hobbyking were the cutting edge I can tell you that this hobby is one of gradual escalation. I made the same mistakes trying to do stuff I couldnt before I learned the ropes and crashing and grounding myself. You cant just start flying and then do power loops. I cant say I have ever gotten inverted on a turn and not been able to recover and I have a fairly heavy craft so that leads me to assume that you may be having difficult with loops and turns. That is fine just dont do things above your skill level because you will crash and you will be unhappy.  Start low to the ground. Fly FPV lower to the ground so when you crash you dont have to spend as much to fix things. Also just practice the motions more and more. I find close to ground flying more rewarding than anything else because it is difficult to maintain that altitude at the same time it is easy to recover your craft and you will hopefully break no more than props. Close to the ground flying is a good way to get a good handle of the combination of pitch roll and yaw when you need to make a turn such as around a tree or when you just need to turn around. When you fly low to the ground you cant use your altitude to your advantage so you have to rely upon the controls in your hand rather than momentum to follow the turn. When you are very confident with being able to fly low you can speed up a bit or you can start gaining some altitude. When you have altitude youll likely feel the power of gravity and propwash a bit more and thats when you want to be careful. Practice going up and down in altitude while moving forward or turning. Just keep your craft in the air. More throttle is better than less throttle. If you feel like your craft is unresponsive on low throttle or maybe it gets some violent oscillations that is propwash. Propwash can be dangerous typically for new pilots. Propwash can be fixed with tuning usually. The reason why more throttle is better than less is your craft will be much more responsive. Be careful not to throttle yourself back to earth but the difference between  and  throttle when trying to just follow the motions is a major difference. The next level of escalation would be flips and rolls. Make sure you give your craft a large bump of throttle so it has nice upward momentum. I would suggest having the motor stop function in CF or BF turned off if you turned it on. Then just lower the throttle and choose a direction left right forward or back. Your craft will fliproll. Practice a few of these each flight. I would suggest with a decent amount of altitude and over a soft surface. You may have to bump up your gains for your FCTxOnce you can do all of these steps then you incorporate all three into every flight. When you can comfortably do this I suspect you will no longer have nearly as many crashes. I dont push myself very hard because I enjoy relaxing flights typically however the last  times Ive crashed have all been hardware related rather than pilot error. Tldr Realistically as stupid as it sounds the best way to stop crashing is to fly more. I would suggest flying lower to the ground and practicing the maneuvers you can handle until you have completely mastered them. Dont escalate altitude or speed until you have done that. Just try your best everything has a learning curve. ,Multicopter,db2b4i6,8,t5_2u9hy

10089454,0,t3_5kanhf,Im gonna give you some recommendations based on what myself and my friends have bought only products Ive seen in real life. Ive never flown KISS gear so I wont recommend it but its a good option.For a budget frame I really like the Emax XH nighthawk . Good compromise of strength and weight and a well thought out design. Frame choice is something personal in my opinion so go with something you like the look of. Personally I think its worth the money buying Lumenier Impulse Armattan Shendrones etc.If youre going for betaflight then the Xracer F V with SPI is the flight controller to get. Its the most reliable F Ive used and has the best combination of features. The only thing it lacks is a V regulator so make sure your PDB has one.As far as Im aware BlHelis ESCs are all much the same so go on Banggood and get yourself some racerstars. The A v ones. The motors Id look at if I was building a quad right now are the BrotherHobby  Ts the Tmotor f vs and the Armattan OOmphs. Personally I think the ceramic bearings are a gimmick but Ive never flown them so who knows. I havent flown any of those motors but theyre all known to be high quality and great performers. My friends unify pro HV impressed the hell out of me but I stick to the old FX series VTxs. They work for me and theyre affordable. If you can get the race version of the unify pro its way more affordable than the other versions though. Oh and get the triumph antennas! They take a beating and are worth the money.,Multicopter,dbmo8ah,2,t5_2u9hy

10284401,0,t1_dc9osxd,Can you point out what might be different that I should know about?  It is hard comparing all of these things.  My brain requires me to process all of this information and come up with an answer.  Ive looked at every radio that Ive seen in the  range.  Ive looked at the Devoe the Spektrum DX and DXe the FlySky FSi FSis and FSix the FrSky Taranis XD and QX and the Turnigy XR pro and Evolution.Here has been my thoughts behind each Devo looks interesting due to its Deviation firmware and its community of modders as well as its ability to control some of the toy BNF quads but it seems cheap. Spektrum looks interesting because thats what some friends use but I havent seen much love elsewhere. FlySky is interesting but simply due to the cost.  Some seem to say that the FlySky is plenty good for most entry level people and at only  for the transmitter it seems like a cost effective way to get started.  There seems to be a decent amount of receivers that work with it.  But many talk bad about it.  Im not sure if it is because there are actual problems or because it is just cheap.  Some people talk about lots of drop outs with it but I dont know if theyve actually owned one or what. The FrSky Taranis XD.  If it were a guy it would enjoy having its dick sucked nonstop in the rMulticopter sub.  It has a great reputation and Im really interested in the JR module port to be able to pick up other BNF quads but maybe Id give up on that once I start building my own. The Taranis Q X looks good.  From the comparisons Ive seen it sounds very similar to the XD just with fewer switches and sliders no battery no SD card and no built in charger while being around  cheaper once you factor in the battery and SD card but maybe Im missing something.  My big concern here is it is an unknown entity.  If the electronics are different enough from the big brother then there are risks like you mentioned. The Turnigy XR pro seems like it is stuck in a weird spot.  At  you cant really say it is cheap enough.  I think the XR was around  which would be much more competitive. The Turnigy Evolution has really piqued my interest but being limited to only AFHDS A kind of sucks for those who want to focus on the micro Tiny Whoop sized quads for now.  I think there is one FC you can use with one receiver.  Overall though I much prefer the XBox style controller and the simplified menu system.  Yes the Taranis is much more powerful but my short term plan is to only fly quads and it sounds like there are a number of well known quad fliers who have switched to the Evo.Anyway I was out drinking and just felt like typing all of that partially so I could see it.  lol.  Spending  on a transmitter and then reselling for  is less interesting to me than spending  on a transmitter and then later spending another .  I mean this is my justification for the cheaper transmitters like the FlySky.  If I stick with the hobby I end up spending  or so extra.  If I hate it maybe I can sell it maybe not but it is still only .  If I love it but the transmitter is just too problematic Ive only risked  and maybe later spend  on a Taranis XD or  on a Q X by the time theyve sorted out the quirks.  I dont know.The biggest risk I see with going with a cheapo controller is that the cheapo controller might turn me off to the hobby where a good one wouldnt.I would say this.  If the Turnigy Evolution supported AFHDS and AFHDS A I wouldnt even have a second thought.  Id have ordered one of those in a heartbeat and this discussion would be over.  As it is the limit on micro quads is the main thing holding me back.,Multicopter,dc9skoc,1,t5_2u9hy

I have afro escs on my miniquad and they all have becs I just cut their v wires off and use a pdb as it makes everything look neater than a pile of wires soldered on to one another.Also I am sure you can easily build a bec into any opto esc design it can run blhelis or whatever as it is not connected to the control side of things just in parallel with the battery.Can they not get a crappy esc if they get a pdb?Opto escs are lighterand cheaper? but if you have escs with built in becs and no other way of regulating voltage would you rather fly and later upgrade or do nothing and later upgrade. I know when I forgot to order a pdb I used my escs bec later I added a pdb and that was a good learning experience as when I rebuilt it I knew how and where to put things better than I did the first time I built it.Anyway I see your point but you should see someone elses.

10683957,0,t3_5ss6qa,Quads are inherently weak at yawing.  They rely on the friction between the blades and the air.  With one set of motors spinning slower and one set spinning faster you get a moment which yaws the quad.  Since this friction is a function of speed of the props the motors have to do a lot of work to yaw.If your yaw rate is too high the one set of motors almost completely stops while the other spins up which can result in a jump.  Most people set their yaw rate lower to avoid this jump.  There used to be a betaflight command for yaw jump prevention and yaw acceleration limit which basically reduced the rate.,Multicopter,ddhywm4,1,t5_2u9hy

All other things held constant increased power generally does lead to increased range in a clear line of sight transmission. However you dont get x the range going from mw to mw just because its x the power.Putting money into quality Rx antenna is going to translate to more range per  than increased tx power. Also consider the world record for .ghz fpv is over km at mw.

10765030,0,t1_ddpro1i,Hey! I actually had very little knowledge of droneselectronics and then I started lurking on this subreddit and became inspired! I did a bunch of research first which pretty much consisted of watching build videos and googling how do I build a quadcopter. I made sure to google any words or lingo that I didnt understand like what is an ESC and how does a flight controller work. I also tried to search this subreddit for things like what flight controller should I use and watched a lot of build videos. Once I had a decent understanding of the basic parts and components I bought a toy grade RFT quad flewcrashed it and took it apart to look at the various components. I also decided at that point that I wanted a deeper understanding of electronics and bought this book though I think that step is highly optional and not required to build a quad. I started working through the book and also bought this soldering practice kit After completing the practice kit I felt more or less ready to try to build this tiny whoop.Since this was my first build I tried to keep it simple. It really just consisted of some very easy soldering and then putting the rest of the parts onto the frame. If youd like more specific instructions or explanations of anything I did let me know! I think this build could definitely be accomplished by anyone with a desire to learn. I learned a lot along the way and Im already planning a bigger more complicated build.,Multicopter,ddqbzus,1,t5_2u9hy

I have a pixhawk on my mm quad as far as I can tell inav is trying to get many of the same functions on a cheaper  smaller controller.Yeah a D gimbal gives you pitch and roll. Assuming you have fairly stable yaw control on the copter that gives you pretty good video. A decent gimbal is more I spent about  on mine but a cheap one makes a massive difference to start with.I eventually built a second mm for bashing about in FPV and use the bigger one almost only for aerial photography type projects now. GPS is actually really useful for that  you can change view to the filming camera and sort of forget about flying  the sticks just tell it where to go and it does it itself. ie full forward on right stick translates to kph ms forward flight in a straight line full up or down on throttle is .ms climb or descend.

Not sure whether the same thing is possible with FlySkys tx firmware.

If only AUX  is down youre armed but in failsafe mode. If only AUX  is down youre out of failsafe mode but disarmed.

11714939,0,t1_dgmheqs,gt Cheerwing CWif you add weights it going to decrease performance and flight time so that might not be your best bet... On bigger quad I have gone low tech and added coins to balance it out once though I wouldnt recommend it. Flying these little quads in the wind all way tough. Though looking up the quad you might not be able to fight the wind simply because it has a locked angle of pitch and roll being in stability mode. I can fight wind with my supped up tiny whoop with out too much issue. Its not usually fun unless line of sight but doable.,Multicopter,dgnx1g9,2,t5_2u9hy

11734888,0,t3_67gkc5,Helping hands and wire strippers are some of my favorite tools for any electrical and electronics related works.The standard helping hands with the builtin soldering iron holder and magnifying glass have been a trusty companion of mine but have also been very restrictive and not that user friendly. The arms do not extend or articulate enough and need to be tightened often in order to hold steady.The wire stripper I was using had become loose and unreliable. It was expected since it was a cheap one made of thin metal alloy and plastic parts.A few months ago I switched them both to try the Realacc Strange Third Hand helping hands and the S.K. wire stripper.They dont break the bank and are both very well made.The Realacc is very sturdy and the arms are extremely convenient for complicated works. They are especially helpful in tricky tight builds where several parts and cables need to be held in place while working on them.The S.K. wire stripper is simply great. Very good build quality and consistent stripping of most cable sizes.The old ones have been retired and stored just in case  I hope I dont need to use them again.,Multicopter,dgq6gss,1,t5_2u9hy

Even the cleanest of that stuff is pretty nasty on the lungs.I love my vape its huge bulky and not too pretty but its been super reliable and has kept me away from cigarettes  so thats a win in my book. Plus the  cells in parallel last me  full days of relatively heavy use and it doesnt stress them out at all since they only have to pull a few c worth of amps.I had a few dodgy home made devices years ago when this current crop of cheap quality products wasnt even something we could imagine.
