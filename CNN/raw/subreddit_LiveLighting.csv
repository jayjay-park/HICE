9939699,0,t1_db35x6y,The only thing with that though and this is why we didnt do a media server. Is that we still wanted to be able to do traditional chases because the creative directors dont always want us using videos on the epix. They really like just a simple sparkle chase. So we added Mbox director into  of our venues. This allows us to crossfade between a video playing from a mac at FOH and any chase or static look we have going on the epix. We dont really have the choice to go full media server. It doesnt help with the lag though it actually makes it a bit worse lol,LiveLighting,db3620i,1,t5_2ui4v
