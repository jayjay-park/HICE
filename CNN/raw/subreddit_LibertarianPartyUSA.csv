7718348,0,t1_d3jhvj1,I get where youre coming from we need to be constantly vigilant of people whether Republicans or Democrats coming to take over our party. However Petersens personally socially liberal so I dont think we have to fear that. He constantly uses the line I disagree with you but I will defend your rights when it comes to religious freedom. Finally unlike Johnson he has not announced a Republican as his VP.,LibertarianPartyUSA,d3jiudj,0,t5_3epv4

9907082,0,t3_5hb2my,Obviously one of the responsibilities of government that we can all agree on is to protect ones right to life. Now I think the biggest question with the topic of abortion is When is an individual considered living? Is it when we emerge from our mothers womb? Is it when a heart starts beating? After the first trimester?The question may be one that we will never be able to answer due to its scientific spiritual and philisophical influences. However I think the main issue of abortion is not the womans right to her bodyalthough that is a big influence but when is a life a life thus being granted basic human rights? We must come up with an answer that the majority of people can believe. Obviously there will be some that think a life is created at the moment of conception and some at the moment of birth but I think this is a question that can only be answered as accurately as possible through scientific research. When are we able to pull a baby from a mother and keep heshe alive? This keeps being pushed earlier and earlier as modern medicine makes advancements. I certainly dont know the answer but I believe that we can all agree that this issue has been distorted and shadowed by other topics that really dont matter to the overall question When is a life a life?,LibertarianPartyUSA,daywzt5,3,t5_3epv4

10367439,0,t1_dciz7ab,Well for example the Ohio  ballot initiative was so contorted into crony capitalism  giving the proposals  biggest backers governmentgranted monopolies on growing marijuana  that all libertarians should have opposed it. But sure if the regulations just put age and safety limitations it may be an acceptable tradeoff that increases net liberty.But libertarians should emphasize the core need for freedom  the freedom to control your own body to manage your own health etc. or else were just reinforcing the idea that anything questionable needs to be regulated and taxed.,LibertarianPartyUSA,dcj7mf9,8,t5_3epv4
10579524,0,t1_dd75oyc,Dont forget the ACA only passed because of a similar refusal.

10621729,0,t1_ddb91i9,People like you are one reason this movement fails repeatedly. You dont know me. You see literally one post in Le Pen that was just a damn news article relevant to that election and some maymays in the Donald and you jump to skinhead. Meanwhile I volunteered on both Paul campaigns attended one of the USs most famous classically liberal colleges worked professionally in liberty politics for several years moved to NH as part of the free state project etc etc. Ive been about as involved in this liberty circle jerk as its possible to be. Yet you think youre in a position to serve as arbiter in some kind of purity test for me? Come back to me when youve read Human Action kid.My objection was simply to the sniveling tone of OP who jumps to calling people bigots when he doesnt like what they have to say. If youd scan down the page I think youll find there was very little that could be called bigotry in this thread including my comment which Im fairly certain OP downvoted within a minute of my posting it.,LibertarianPartyUSA,ddbju4q,1,t5_3epv4

10942235,0,t1_de82yjk,It gets tricky right there with eminent domain.  The government has the ability to say Sorry a highway is coming through where your home is. and has the authority to back it up.  The private enterprise does not.  Sure capital incentive would be greater.  Ill buy your property for  above market value. sounds great however sometimes some people just dont want to move until they die.  You need the persuasion and authority of the state to move society along the right path.  Violence being the only true force etc.Im a supportive libertarian and understand your position.  The question for us really is I think what partyprinciple concessions do we have to make to local governments to obtain seats and what partyprinciple immobility do we take when it comes to federal level mandates?  At the same time if we are that principled wed never have things like the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System or FEMA  Which of course a libertarian would say Great! but a lot of others would not like this position at all.  This is where the greater population shakes their head and pats ours like an unintelligent child would be treated.We have to be very clear as to what we mean by smaller government because the Republicans say smaller government and well we see what they do with that phrase when they obtain authority.  Right now as a party we are a dotted line around a multitude of shallow pools each one of its own thought.  We need a firm plan nationally that we can implement for local and state elections and stay firm.  We cant build this party without a strong cornerstone foundation of local representation.  Once we gain respect and prominence locally we can then attack the federal senate and congressional seats.  My thoughts aside good luck on your upcoming race.Taxation is theft of course.  However at some point we have to also concede that as an organized society Americans would rather have an electable body in control of our municipalities and necessities of which we are providing our voted on willful contribution aka taxes.  The issue I see is that the current tax environment is that they are not appropriated accordingly and or individuals have little oversight as constituents.  These disenfranchised voters are the people we need to convince to join our camp.  Right now all we do is bicker with each other about how much we know about Rothbard or the like we hardly reach out to the public other than to say something like Its better over here.  We need to explain like your video does why its better over here.For example I frankly dont know how to easily get the breakdown of my towns ledger to find out if the mayor had take out for lunch every day of the year or if he actually paid for a new fire hydrants to be installed instead.  I think as a libertarian our goal would be to leverage technological innovations to supplement our parties stance.  An app for every town that you can specifically see what projects are going on and instead of having to attend town halls you can just vote No on any given subject.I may have ranted a bit too much here but all in all we need to start a real discussion somewhere about these topics.  As a wanting representative of our party I felt you might be interested in hearing what one of your members has to say.  Keep fighting the good fight!,LibertarianPartyUSA,de8m4mv,6,t5_3epv4
