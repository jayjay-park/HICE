11804120,0,t1_dgxrmhp,So far with this new version and some other mods I added my game doesnt freezes or ctd in normal gameplay. The ctds occurs only after several reloadings after dying I am not permadeath I have to say it is rock stable. So I recommend to you start from scratch and let every mod without merging. It is worthy. Good luck! ,ultimateskyrim,dgy1dj4,1,t5_3juzs
