8492286,0,t3_4vyte6,With the adequate enemy comp its a decent item the problem is you lack sustain that you can get from stuff like Deadmans Iceborn BC. If you can make it work in a heavy ad penetration build then it might actually be good. Id say its a situational item.,yorickmains,d6331ya,1,t5_37i85

8715332,0,t1_d6uy8dd,well the way i figure it was you didnt gain much cdr and damage for leveling it up as well as the heal and core stats scaling more off of levels and items where the E gains more damage and more cdr per level althought the mana cost does get more tedious. also how good is E for waveclear? i know its not grade A but if its decent? anything else you wanted to add?,yorickmains,d6v1zaa,1,t5_37i85

The lower you are the more socially unacceptable you are.If youre to the left of the vertical axis its not as much of a deal than if youre to its right.

Also this feels like itd be a pretty simple skin no  engaging interactions or cool effects weve waited this long I dont want some skin line yorick skin I want THE Yorick skin a skin that screams THIS IS MY MAIN a Yorick skin to end all Yorick skins cause lets be honest were only going to get one TT,yorickmains,dewr803,2,t5_37i85
11498643,0,t3_642pts,he does not get kited hard. If youre any decent and you land your e the champion you usually hit is pretty much guaranteed to be dead.As for his damage he has an insane dps. He only feels weak and does no damage if you dont have ult or ghouls up.,yorickmains,dfzdd34,0,t5_37i85

11749934,0,t1_dgrvj3c,Nah Shen isnt that hard. A bit yes because he can escape your W with dash. But if you bait the dash and either bait his block abilityor punch through it during a trade you can easily beat him in v especially after you get your maiden. Yorick usually doesnt have that much problems vs tanks overall. ,yorickmains,dgrvumn,1,t5_37i85
