4008385,0,t1_crcycsh,Fehr is gone that lost faceoff in Game  OT was his last play as a Capital Too many forwards behind him read Wilson that need an opportunity for an increased role. Green I would take back at a steep discount and not very long in term. But him and his hot wife are probably moving on. Ward is interesting but the Caps have other priorities before going after him. Beagle is the one UFA player I want because he wont be that expensive and is very versatile.Holtby is going to require a deal worthy on an elite goaltender. Kuznetsov is a little more important than Johansson because his ceiling is higher.. Other big RFAs that nobody wants to talk about is Grubauer and Galiev. I think the caps need both Grubby for than Galiev.The Caps finished th in the league and th in scoring during the regular season. They have Galiev Boyd Barber Vrana Bowey and Lewington that will all be rookies looking to make the roster and they will get an extended look. With the Caps it is almost an embarrassment of talent coming up the pipeline. So I dont think they need to mortgage that future to pursue another short term fix read Glencross Arnott Fedorov Penner Erat Ribiero.,stevedangle,crd6pth,1,t5_383lf

Just because his DB said he needed to work on his skating when he got drafted over  years ago doesnt mean he is a Polak Jr. like you are assuming. John Tavares needed to work on his skating as well and I would say that worked out okay.Strome hit  points at  years old. Like Steve said in the video he would think JVR is worth a st which would be very late from a playoff team and a prospect. A late st and a prospect is not worth near Strome or Pulock.
