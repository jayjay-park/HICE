7609391,0,t1_d371ce8,Its fair to think Wakanda is involvedbut we cant take it as fact. South Africa has made extensive use of mercenaries in the past and is probably the only other power on the continent who could employ someone of his abilities.Plus if he were fulfilling a Captain America type role wouldnt he be highly more visible? This is the first Im hearing of this character. We wont know what this guys motives are until he tells us directly. ,Earth199999,d375cvf,3,t5_39ckb
7755789,0,t1_d3nrf3w,Good innocent people get dragged into the crossfire in every conflict. It sucks and I feel bad for those cops but they were on the wrong side this time. Steve Rogers best friend is Sam Wilson. If he harbored the popular prejudices of his time he wouldnt have a black friend. Again you keep calling these institutions lesser evils but they straight up tried to murder millions of people several times.Steve Rogers being in charge isnt a dictatorship. He doesnt want authority over out lives in any kind of way. All he wants is to be able to protect the world without oversight from a group that could be easily be corrupted just like the last one was and used to slaughter half the planet.,Earth199999,d3nrwo0,3,t5_39ckb

8571682,0,t1_d6cuzly,Why on earth would we make it through any of this when we have a history of treating the people who would protect us from this sort of thing like garbage because theyre powerful enough to oppose the threats? What happened this spring was messed up but I cant help but think part of why it went so badly is because people tried too hard to exert control over something with no respect for the utter lack of control they have. The entitlement and arrogance of government types can be astounding and I can only assume that gets worse as you go up the food chain.Maybe Im just bitter about my life and the state of the world but part of me insists that when whatever threat youre afraid of comes Ill be sipping fruity drinks on the beach watching the fireworks. The fact is Ill probably try to do the right thing whatever small and insignificant thing that is at the time but I just feel so powerless right now that the only thing I can do is air my most cynical thoughts on Reddit. ,Earth199999,d6d1iv6,5,t5_39ckb

10135525,0,t1_dbsmp8c,Im not allowed to give out exact salary numbers but lets just say I was able to buy a big home and a sizable property after  years of work.There were indeed some perks. Examples include me being able to travel to every by the US recognized state without a VISA and I also had a de facto second citizenship for the US. Every flight to and from the US was paid for me. A dental plan was not included because of our rather big paycheck. I am able to effort a pretty good private insurance which has its advantages as my teeth are quite bad.P,Earth199999,dbsnvr0,10,t5_39ckb
