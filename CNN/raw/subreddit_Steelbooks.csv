4642749,0,t1_ctfnmil,I recommend you join HiDef Ninja or BluRay.coms forums. That way you can know when something gets announced and not just when it starts shipping after months of being sold out. Group buys at both places are very helpful and able help out tremendously for steelbooks you otherwise cant find except from eBay scalpers,Steelbooks,ctfs90f,1,t5_2xddn
4962101,0,t1_cujzsyw,But there was no marking on the plastic cover or on the shrink wrap which makes me think it was something that happened before it even shipped out. I suppose my main concern was whether it was something that happened commonly with steelbooks so I could look out for it in the future.,Steelbooks,cuk0fiz,1,t5_2xddn

10655115,0,t1_ddew5as,This will be region locked though its down to the studios rather than the retailer. As a rule of thumb if its an older movie getting a steelbook release the disc itself is almost always the same so a good place to check region coding is www.dvdcompare.netIn general Disney so including Pixar Marvel and recentfuture Lucasfilm are always region free. Most but not all Fox WB Universal and Paramount releases are also region free.Indie labels are usually locked as they only have the rights to release in their own country ,Steelbooks,ddezrkg,3,t5_2xddn
