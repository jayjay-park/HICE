5431268,0,t1_cw5uae0,Personally I think Mario has a tough time against Pikachu Again IMO.The reason why most people generally pick Mario over Doc is because of mobility combos  spike potential FLUDD and recovery. Yet all these factors become limited not impossible towards the Pikachu match up. This can be seen in the Evo match with Esam vs Ally. Esam ended up losing from costly mistakes yet overall his Pikachu bodied his Mario MANY times. Thats why Nairo picked Doc mainly because the Pikachu match up for Doctor Mario was similar to how a Mario would approach it except for the fact that Doc deals more damage. Overall Mario is a much better character the only advantage Doc has against Mario is that he can deal more damage. Just like we saw in the Pikachu match up Doc could be better than Mario in some specific match ups however not as many. Hence the tier list. As for a Luigi switch in that would have been much smarter and more badass than Doc. Ayy lmao,MarioMains,cw5weft,1,t5_38dqs

5564974,0,t1_cwmrdyc,Actually he does have some flaws. Lack of a better recovery gets his butt whooped by characters with reflectors or GampW bucket he loses to some wierd characters like Villager DarkPit and GampW. Now about the matchup spread of those characters I mentionedRosalina Loses toZSSSheikPikachu Loses toLuigiMarioZSS Loses toPikachuSheikNess Loses toRosalinaSheikMario Loses toSheikGampWFoxDarkPitVillagerThere are probably more but this was just to give you a general idea about what Im talking about.,MarioMains,cwmvw2o,1,t5_38dqs

8097469,0,t3_4q3vbe,My god this troll again. I love anti hes my favourite mario. But he literally switched off of mario in the rosa matchup because he didnt wanna get bodied in the matchup. Why else would he switch to what is considered rosas worst mu? Plus zinoto was bodying antis mario as well so he had to switch to cloud. But take that with a grain of salt zinoto has bodied Allys mario too so maybe hes just good at the matchup. Maybe you should try watching watching these tournaments without your rock hard erection for mario blocking your view. ,MarioMains,d4q88e4,2,t5_38dqs
