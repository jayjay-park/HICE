8707922,0,t1_d6soti5,Correct . I have used SW around  times during my trips to the States and have never had anything but positive experiences with them .,SouthwestAirlines,d6u4jbw,1,t5_32dcw
9942402,0,t1_db3ghn1,SWAs website isnt supposed to switch sistercity destinations like that but every once in a while it does. Maybe every once in  searches. But it has done it to me enough that I now know it and watch for it. I didnt always know about this bug. I have purchased the wrong ticket before. Having a flight that lands at LAX at am on a Monday is nontrivially different from one that is supposed to land at SNA at am when the next flight to SNA isnt until am and you have a meeting to attend in Irvine that morning. LAX and SNA may only be  miles apart but in LA traffic that means  hours in an Uber. It was solved by my running over to the American Airlines gate that had a flight to SNA about to depart and buying a ticket at walkup price that morning. Overall I am very happy with Southwests website but that is one bug I am not impressed with. ,SouthwestAirlines,db3ipcq,2,t5_32dcw
10357871,0,t3_5ob4wa,It usually gets more expensive the closer you are the departure date  but its not unheard of for a flash oneday sale to be springed on us by SWA.You unfortunately cannot book a trip with some points and pay the rest of the way at least you couldnt when I did two years ago and I dont see any sort of option to do it today. Addressing your k shortage  you can simply buy those points outright from SWA and then use them  or pay one way of one ticket outright with cash. You can also get points transfered but last I checked there was a  fee to do that like  for each  or something,SouthwestAirlines,dci4ipb,2,t5_32dcw
10963863,0,t1_deatqqh,I dont think so if you ever travel through Nashville its like  guitars.. I would just check at the desk but if its not a full flight you should be okay. Or if you see someone else with one just ask what they are doing. I think we are pretty chill when it comes to those.,SouthwestAirlines,deauftx,1,t5_32dcw
