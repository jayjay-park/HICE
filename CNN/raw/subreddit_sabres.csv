The Sabres will need to overpay for shortterm contracts just to hit that floor.  Meaning one or twoyear deals likely as ridiculous or more ridiculous than what we gifted Mezaros. But to add one more thing about your earlier point... Ristolainen and Girgensons both have one more year until their first turn as RFAs.  With RFA poaching virtually nonexistent leverage is minimal until approaching UFA status.  Contracts will most likely still be in the low millions.  It wont be for another four five six seven years as these players approach UFA status that if they deserve fat paychecks we need to start worrying about the salary cap.,sabres,co8o2fz,1,t5_2raob

Hed be of interest for the bottom pairing.Fleury isnt a free agent. He just got an extension and is staying in Pittsburgh.Justin Williams It depends on what he wants. If he goes for money then lets get him. Great mentor and still a solid player. If hes trying to win hes not coming here.Francois Beauchemin would be a great addition for our defense. Would be ecstatic if we land him.Antti Niemi is the only free agent goalie that wasnt already here worth considering. Starting him and bringing back Enroth as the backup would be a HUGE upgrade immediately that could help us make us an immediate playoff contender with a few other moves.Cody Franson will cost A LOT but we have money to spend.

3265622,0,t1_cp0htyn,Well the thing to keep in mind is that their rankings are built to be inaccurate.  A B ranking means a potential drop of up to two tiers on their ranking system meaning on an . prospect like Reinhart from first line center to third line role players.  A C ranking means a potential drop of up to two tiers.  A D ranking up to three tiers.  In the case of Bailey at C that means . nd line winger  rd liner to . career AHLer.  In the case of Possler at D that means . same to . out of league.  See what I mean?  Prospect development is inherently volatile as are their rankings.  Hockeys Future is great for first impressions.  But the important thing to remember is that most of even the ones we really want to like Bailey Baptiste Zadorov McCabe wont turn into anything measurable.  ,sabres,cp0iafy,3,t5_2raob

4463113,0,t1_cst5caa,Again youre entitled to your opinion but I really believe that the guys we gave up are not better than the guys weve received in the trades and by extension put us much closer to being a contender than we were before or would be if we just held on to all our assets and hoped that they panned out. The reason these trades were good for the team is because they take the mystery out of the prospect process. Whats the point in waiting and hoping that some of your prospects turn into guys like Kane and OReilly when you can simply have Kane and OReilly?I can understand being frustrated with people relying on the too early to evaluate argument since you seem hellbent on evaluating things ASAP but there is a large amount of truth to the statement. There are occasions when a trade can be evaluated fairly quickly but its almost impossible to predict the outcome of a trade without knowing the results of the contributions of each player. Until a piece of a trade plays a significant amount of time for their new squad its too early to tell in almost every single case.Finally you may need to just pay a little more attention to things if you find yourself surprised by events like the OReilly trade. His situation was documented over and over the last few years. It wasnt some mystery that hed be moved or why he was probably going to be moved. It was a mixture of tough negotiating by his agent the teamelected arbitration process Calgary throwing him an offer sheet and too many young guys in Colorado that will need to be signed in the near future all of which made him too expensive for the Avs. Buffalo could afford him so they chose to pay him. On the analytics front of course youre going to see that stuff pop up regarding a player with his style of play. Its really really difficult to quantify the skill level of a two way player like him. Advanced stats are one way to do so. Im not sure if that really adds perspective to your comment or if you meant something completely different because OReilly is the perfect example of when fans and media should refer to analytics.tldr Players coming in are without a doubt better than those going out the too early to evaluate isnt so much an argument as it is a fact of life OReillys situation was well documented and advanced stats are the best way to quantify twoway players like him.,sabres,cst95mj,2,t5_2raob

Nylander is best cause he goes straight to the Amerks for a year. And searching for ideas to your nd question I simply looked up this years free agents. We arent getting probably a hall or Eberle or bigger name in a trade. And the UFAs not named Stamkos are a tire fire. Dont over spend and wheel a great deal for any of the top  RFAs with the most cap strapped willing team. Any of Johansson Killorn Schenn Kreider Schwartz and Hoffman. All different amounts of size and skill this top  needs. Dont overpay for Okposo just trade for Kreider. Instead of max offering for Stammer Hoffman or Schwartz both fill a huge gap for scoring. No RFA trades are easy but Im looking right down the sights thinking Saad trade last year. No more Leino ehrhoff UFA overpaying crap if his name doesnt start with Steven or end with stamkos.

9652316,0,t3_5d6bqb,Canucks fan here. Came over looking for sabres fan view on these rumours and thought I could provide a Canucks perspective. Let me know to piss off if required. On Canucks situation in general  cannot score to save our lives desperate to find a replacement C and secondary scoring brimming with defenseman who are mostly passable. On the possible roster returns for our expansion bros  Tanev I cant really see us parting with Tanev. Hes  arguably the best defensive Dman in the league and on a sweetheart deal. When hes injured everyone else has to shift up a level and we start seeing holes. Hes being considered as possible trade bait but that means a full on rebuild. Expect to pay a lot more than you may be willing. Im guessing Kane a first and a b prospect for Tanev and a mid pick. Just a guess. Its hard to separate the emotional attachment here.  Edler A solid nd D all around. On a full NTC so unlikely to waive unless going to a non contender. Would likely fetch something like Kane . Doubt it would happen.  HuttonRookie who unexpectedly made the team last year and proceeded to drastically exceed expectations. Currently in a sophomore slump often blamed on the fact that his partner is not as good as last years and he is trying to do too much. I doubt he gets moved behind is high on him but much closer in value to Kane imo. Id be sad to see him go hes super lovable.  GudbransonRecently acquired in exchange for Jared McCann. Huttons partner he is a fine thth. May work but relies on Bennington selling low and giving up fast. Something he has done before Clendening Vey. Value similar to Hutton. SbisaPassable th th Dman on a TERRIBLE contact. Plays great until he serves up a giveaway affectionately termed pizzas as a play on his name. Often the odd man on our logjam bottom defense pairings. ideally we could trade him out and probably would need sweetener. Theories now are possibly Jordan subban Id be sad hes another defensive tire fire but an offensive dynamo virtanen or maybe even juolevi doubt that one.  StretcherBURN THE CITY TO THE GROUNDFan favourite NCAA signing who is over performing and local. I doubt hes considered. Currently filling in for Tanev on the first pairing on his th game.... LarsenAnother odd man out. PP specialist similar value to sbisa but less of a high event player.  BiegaReplacement level player.  TryamkinGiant rookie who seems to be doing well. See stretcher. I feel like I forgot someone. One extra note we need one of sbisa or biega to meet our expansion draft exposure needs. Edited for formatting,sabres,da2ujkw,10,t5_2raob

9874582,0,t1_datyh36,gt Before Petrovic was injured he was paired with Pysyk. While they were together through the first  games or so they were the nd best pairing in the NHL.Oh my word.  The second best pairing in the entire NHL.  Oh my word.  Lets offer sheet Pysyk when he comes up.   years  million.  Totally worth it.No.  Heh.  Sarcasm aside I would ask you Via what metric? Then I would ask you what are the splits of Pysyk without Petrovic and Petrovic without Pysyk.  Then I would ask you how they were deployed in what situations they were deployed what their ice time was and so forth.  Then I would arrive at a conclusion.  I dont want Pysyk playing  minutes a night because chances are there are players with other skill sets who I want in different situations playing more.  i.e. I dont want Mark Pysyk on my power play because although he does make smart decisions with the puck especially coming out of his own zone he doesnt possess the kind of shot to get through traffic or the kind of passing acumen to man the point.  That role goes to someone like Ristolainen like Ekblad like Keith like  Franson etc.  He also isnt my preferred penalty killing solution.  He doesnt have the body or the tenacity to be able to hold up pucks in corners to knock wingers off the puck to clear the front of the net.  And weve seen all that.  Judging by the fact that hes only averaging  per game with Florida it seems like theyve reached a pretty similar conclusion.    On the other hand Kulikov has excellent possession numbers for us in a limited sample while playing more minutes and playing in more varied circumstances.  Hes not the PP ace that I spoke of in reference to Ristolainen Ekblad or Keith but he has been on the second unit with regularity in a limited sample.  Hes been a PK fixture and has demonstrated the physical skills I spoke of earlier.  There are areas of his game I wish were more refined but he brings a lot to the table. Mark Pysyk may be one of the better rd pairing defenseman in the NHL.  He may be close to the ideal. For  to  minutes a game at even strength he may help out a team to a phenomenal degree.  Well see.  Lets pull apart the metric you referenced but did not identify via all of the splits I mentioned.  Heres what I expect to find Ekblad Yandle Demers and others playing harder matchups.   Eklbad Yandle Demers and others with more def zone starts etc.   Limited PPSHG utilization relative to other defenders.   Limited role. Physical mismatch.  i.e. His last game against Boston where he allowed David Backes to assume beautiful position right in front of Luongo with zero battle en route to a goahead goal.  Then reference ALL OF THIS back to Kulikov and what Kulikov brings to the table.  So identify explicitly the metric youre using which you didnt do.  Give context.  Analyze role.  Essentially... do all the things that Coller never ever did.  ,sabres,dauojd5,2,t5_2raob

I remember last year Jack tossed a beautiful back hand pass through traffic that landed perfectly on Kanes stick and he rang it off the post because I think it caught him off guard that Jack was able to get that pass through.

My point was  in reference to the comments on the  season and before that the  season. Or as I said the division and schedule has seen many differences from  years agoThe reasons why Toronto is doing well this season are numerous and in no way indicative of how good or bad our team is. Our team has the pieces to do well but injuries and a culture of losing are hurting us. Toronto is ahead of us after  or so games by a few points despite us being saddled by injuries. Even if we won  more games with Jack Eichel in the lineup all year im saying JUST jack eichel ignore the injuries to our blue line ROR Kane etc even  more games and wed be right up there with Toronto so the argument that they are leaps and bounds ahead of us does not hold water with me.That said our division is better than it was  years ago that was all I was saying and you seemingly agree because you pointed out how Toronto even last year was shitting the bed and is now much better!,sabres,ddd8rvp,1,t5_2raob

Certainly not one younger defender close. Look at teams like Edmonton Chicago Columbus Pittsburgh for rebuilds done right none of these teams traded picks prematurely to win now.We want to build a long term solution do we not? That means constantly restocking draft cupboards with high picks so that when we can no longer afford our roster we have plenty of draft picks to replace and we can stay competitive for years. If all goes well we could have Jack fucking Eichel for the next  years.Lets make sure we can stock decent prospects to make the best use of that and not try to win now.The Sabres pipeline is dreadfully thin right now and we need to restock while allowing this team to grow and develop.I hope and believe TM has the sense to not be impatient with this rebuild.I suspect many of you are salty about the Maple Leafs but remember the Leafs were horrible for decades. Stop buying into this  year rebuild narrative. Their top players Gardiner JVR Bozak Kadri were all a product of pre moves. Nylander was drafted  years ago?

11516601,0,t1_dg0qcc9,I mean the Leafs only won st overall once and got very lucky with Matthews. The rest were smart drafting and a good farm system. The Sabres have dominated the Leafs for like a decade. Leafs into Buffalo was basically an automatic loss.

Let me remind you we finished last place last year and are now in the playoffs just to emphasize how much has changed since last year especially with Babcock.,sabres,dghevfr,3,t5_2raob

11690490,0,t3_66e868,He is one of the top free agent defenseman in a weak year. He isnt the fastest of all skaters and has struggled against speedier teams. Teams are only getting faster and I think Alzner is not the guy the Sabres should be looking at. However there is another player on Washington that Buffalo should really look at. Dmitry Orlov. A  year old whose entry level contract expired last year and signed a  year extension with the caps for under  mil. Hes still an RFA but I dont think Washington can keep him. Orlov is a smooth skating aggressive defenseman with offensive upside. He would be a great nd pair guy. ,sabres,dgl4vbn,1,t5_2raob
