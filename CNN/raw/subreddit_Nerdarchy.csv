5041795,0,t3_3i74vw,I would do story arcs per DM.  Have one DM do like  sessions close the story arc then have a new DM step in for the next arc.  Having DMs switch every session will hurt IMO.  Other DMs dont want to run the first DMs story I feel they would like to come up with there own adventure.  Edit. I do this with my current DM.  While he is DMing right now his character is off being mayor of Winter Haven.  I DMed the first story Keep of the Shadowfel took like  months cause its e and we only play once a month.,Nerdarchy,cutq71m,1,t5_33xgj

I just flat out hate dealing with wealthy characters at lvl  so Ive never really tried to solve that problem. ,Nerdarchy,ddk8y9k,1,t5_33xgj
