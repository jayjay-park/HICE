8613460,0,t3_4xrhlw,As with Adnan Syeds case most likely the State will appeal this decision. This might be subject to considerable scrutiny. The Seventh Circuit where this case is is fairly conservative and the lone judge that made this determination which basically amounts to clearing Dassey with no ability to retry him is a relatively new appointee with no criminal justice background. The appellate challenge for the State and the defense will be to pull out all the other cases where the federal court found the State decision on voluntariness to be unreasonable. My guess is that without looking at them this judge substantially raised the bar especially since this confession bore so little of the other indicia of involuntariness that courts have taken issue with physical violence torturelike tactics psychological manipulation. This one essentially finds fault with the police because Dassey was a little slow and they didnt let him see his mommy. I have a really tough time accepting that with nothing more than his IQ number and some school records this lone judge can conclude that a yearold didnt understand that confessing to a violent murder with his uncle wouldnt have negative consequences and that the polices constant assurances that they were on his side if he confessed amount to an undue promise of leniency. Our justice system is moving away from using confessions as absolute proof as is but the help us help you tactic is Interrogation . The judge here was careful enough that he didnt carve out any new rules with this decision but given that so many murders are committed by young people with limited intelligence its going to beg that question about how the police can interrogate these types of suspects at all. While that may be the direction that our system is heading in anyway I can certainly see a situation where elder judges in the system might have a problem with one single judge taking it upon himself to set this standard.Another point sometimes the system finds a way to correct itself in the face of injustice over outcome. I think in a perfect world the State wanted Brendan to cooperate receive a fair plea deal accounting for his age and manipulation by his uncle and go after the real villain here. To me that didnt happen because Brendans mother got in the way causing him to lose trust with his first attorney and the State. The result is that the State had no choice but to go to trial with the result speaking for himself. This decision may be a way or an attempt by a neutral party to conclude that both sides got what they want the State got a chunk of Dasseys life while Dassey gets part of his life back. The problem with this approach is that neither side will let up. Dasseys family who already profited against the State in Stevens first case will almost certainly file civil suit which the State has a clear interest in opposing. I dont see how they can retry him without the confession but maybe with improved forensic techniques they can tighten up their case.,rangerland,d6ia2t9,1,t5_383qs

This might not look good on someone trying to run for president especially when more than half of the country still hasnt recovered from the  recession and is still disillusioned by the bank bailouts.And when your family is already fantastically wealthy tell her not give speeches about income inequality while wearing K jackets. Thats tone deafness on a Mitt Romneylevel. I love that theres a Snopes article debunking this saying hold on a minute thats just the retail price its probably more likely she bought this when it was about .K! Aha. Whoo.And speaking of Mitt can you tell her not to have her own  moment and call significant portion of the people in the country deplorables? Because while Trump is clearly garbage while many of the people who work for him and advise him are garbage a lot of other politicians are aware enough not to go after the voters and supporters the great unwashed nobodies who have little money and even less power. Speaking of old times can you tell her to remember why she was beaten in the  primaries by a relative unknown and was almost beaten in the  primaries by someone the pundit intelligentsia thought had a  shot because they sold people on CHANGE and the future and seemed to genuinely understand where the common person was coming from? You can say and did that its something of a lie to sell people on change when you probably wont be able to achieve most of it but people look to politicians for their direction and vision. Which way are they trying to go?Can you tell her not to support things like the TPP and fracking and aggressive foreign policy and other items most left of center people are heavily against?Tell her when shes holding one of the most powerful jobs in the world to not run a private email server because even if youre not conducting nefarious deeds through it it is out of protocol it does run directly against her role as a public servant in a government job and its incredibly suspicious. Its like Tom Bradys smashed cell phones. You cant take the explicit effort to hide things and then tell the people you had nothing to hide. It doesnt work like that.Tell her to not cram the DNC full of lifelong friends and operatives who everyone suspects are pulling strings for her behind the scenes and then when it is found out that did happen and they resign in disgrace can you tell her not to then award these people with jobs in her campaign? Can she not then replace one crooked HRC operative DWS with another Brazile? Whoo this is an easy one. I think a concussed toddler would even have the presence of mind and understanding not to do these things.And tell her that when she gets the nomination and half the liberals in the country are furious at her and her campaign for all those things above to not nominate a centerright VP who has also been part the ClintonDNC machine for years?I could go on and on and on. You can focus on undefined reasons and pretend America just has it out for women or something the same America that now has more women in congress than ever but Ill tell you that if she did just ONE QUARTER of these things above differently shes the next president of the United States.
