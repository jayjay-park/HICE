7541135,0,t1_d2zduso,Oh sweet! Happy to introduce someone to him! Hes been going hard since the s Id say that he is comparable to Aesop but overall he is more experimental. If you get into him Id start with this or Perfect hair then work your way back. ,backpacker,d2ze2sz,6,t5_2ujzs
7564978,0,t1_d3237ra,Its definitely his most personal album I also think its his most straight forward. I like these things about it but alot of people dont like how its so direct. I think its too soon to call it album of the year but it my favorite that released so far.,backpacker,d323nw4,3,t5_2ujzs

8429322,0,t1_d5v4t0u,Yeah.  Hate that feeling when I come across an artist and by coincidence the first few songs are by far my favorite in their whole catalogue and I got my hopes up that all of their stuff is like that.  Happens occasionally but usually not.  Still like some of his newer stuff as well though.,backpacker,d5v7fqi,1,t5_2ujzs
