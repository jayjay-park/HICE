463033,0,t1_cfsq9kk,Thanks for your input. I currently work for tips and rent an apartment. Im looking to buy a house in the next year or so and I know from past experience that buying a house is tough when they see my whole income is based on tips. As for the work Im not afraid of hard labor or long hours. I cant wait to get a paycheck with all of that ot. ,nwi,cfswc37,1,t5_2sb9k
629215,0,t1_cgbrm1c,Ive not had a bad experience at the brewpub although I dont visit too often despite hearing bad things from other people in the area. They do seem to suffer from apathy though which is rather aggravating. Mostly they just dont always make that much sense and Im still surprised their brewpub is as small as it is considering the support they have from NWI.It would definitely be nice to have some more places around that have quality beer and good food. Currently I go to Old Chicago in Merrillville for different beer simply because they have the best selection of new things to try.,nwi,cgbsjm6,1,t5_2sb9k

6133231,0,t3_3zhcai,Another vote for Bombers on the BBQ front. Tomato Bar for unique pizza and good draft menu. El Amigo for Mexican have also heard great if not better things about Marias in Highland but havent been there yet.  Floyds if you can go on a weeknight.,nwi,cyms8hj,3,t5_2sb9k
