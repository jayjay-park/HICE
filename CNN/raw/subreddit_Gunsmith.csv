9947233,0,t3_5hyztb,Apprentice to a local gunsmith would be a good idea for someone as young as you. That will give you hands on experience with how things work. You can watch a ton of videos read all the books and know the theoryhowwhy of things but its so much better when you can physically work on them. Kind of like a gunsmiths usual other locksmithing. I seen all the videos knew how the pins worked dimple locks even disc locks....but until I actually got a set of picks and actually got to fooling around with them I didnt realize the various tensions the difference in feel of a bound pin due to too much tension and a serrated pin that got hung up. Hands on is the best way to go...and under the knowing eye of someone experienced will usually help you hone the craft.,Gunsmith,db45eh7,1,t5_32t3z
