We dont have a price choppers but we have Walmart FreshCo and Independent for groceries as Im sure youve noticed driving by on the highway.  There are  Chinese places they all taste relatively similar.   We also have  pizza places Milano and Dominoes are my favourites yeah I said dominoes.  There isnt much downtown but Im sure youve noticed.  Great place to live if you have a boat though.,carletonplace,d4q06kg,2,t5_2wt1k
