The number of votes you get in an election is based on your empire population and you pretty much are telling your representative Yeah everyone in my empire votes for meBecause theyre power grabbing if Feudal dissenters will be shot if dictatorship we are of one mind in Unification and as for Democracy... well Im surprised you dont get a hung parliament with the Klaxons for that one...,masteroforion,cpwjoy4,4,t5_2tf8y
3582999,0,t3_31do74,In case its a serious question You might want to be able to build a ship with a specific loadout of equipment leaving space so tight you can only fit a class I shield instead of a class III. Or you might want to help improve your relations with the Psilons slightly. Or you might want them to have class III shields so they can be a stronger buffer between you and another hostile empire.If its not a serious question Well obviously you dont. You just chuckle lightly pat them on their adorably brainy heads and tell them to run along home.,masteroforion,cq0ovfc,3,t5_2tf8y
4406655,0,t1_csmah2z,Cool! I was hoping that was in the cards. Note that a good modding API is still a valuable addition though even when the whole thing is open source. Its hard to run multiple forks at once for example.When you leave people to build their own modding APIs you end up with something like Minecrafts modding scene. It works but its kind of a hot mess. Compared to even fully open source games with proper mod support like OpenTTD or OpenXcom you can see the difference.,masteroforion,csmd4o9,1,t5_2tf8y

6728235,0,t1_d0f74r9,Just tested it.  Even with AI turned off in tactical mode as soon as your ships get in range they fire their weapons.  So all tactical mode is offering you atm is where you want to put your ships and what to focus fire on if you WANT to assuming the AI doesnt fire first due to range.,masteroforion,d0f9b2w,1,t5_2tf8y

6766447,0,t3_48d454,Its been a while since I played MOO but in my honest opinion even though not based on any real phenomenon I feel they do add strategic depth. I played two games of MOO remake so far and always had safely tucked away civil planets on which I skipped defences to rush economy. In an open field Id need to worry about these probably resulting in mindless spam of defences every before wars. Thats not appealing either especially as fleet size is rather limited. The way I see them starlanes substitute terrain thats ever so important in strategy games in a space environment that could otherwise make no logical sense of movement restrictions. ,masteroforion,d0j98nn,3,t5_2tf8y

6777253,0,t1_d0kbdeb,That is simply not true. Even now with the crappy balance we have you can kite the enemy and win battles in tactical that would be a loss in simulated. I am not saying the combat system we have now is good or even OK,masteroforion,d0khhfy,8,t5_2tf8y

6807306,0,t1_d0gwsph,gt Ability to change the default research screen to the tech tree. Or remove the non tree screen entirely it is redundant. I like to be able to see whats next without having to manually navigate to the tree screen. Also when going to the tree screen it always starts at the left or base and you have to scroll to find where youre at. Would prefer that it auto navigates me to the latest available projects so they are center screen.Please dont recommend this. I actually play without ever looking at the tech tree intentionally.,masteroforion,d0nwjym,1,t5_2tf8y
6814877,0,t1_d0nvnce,Good points all around. It now seems to me that theres just as much depth to starlanes as there was to ship range as a limiting factor on exploration its just a different kind of depth.Perhaps theres room for both or perhaps there could be some kind of starlane density slider when creating a game. My biggest problem with starlanes is the seemingly arbitrary manner in which they are laid out.,masteroforion,d0ori49,1,t5_2tf8y

6955142,0,t1_d14osn7,It definitely wasnt that. This happened twice within twenty turns and the second time it happened it took out a colony ship on the way to another planet and my economy was fine. Check out uSkibbles and my comment chain and youll see we went over the mysterious explosion. Ive definitely had the Mysterious Explosion pop more than one ship in previous games though.Im currently playing again with pretty much the same exact circumstances same galaxy number size age etc and havent been able to recreate the issue. I wish I took screenshots when this all happened. If this wasnt a bug the only thing I can think of is that I didnt noticed the Fleet A and B tabs but it doesnt explain them not being there at all. I wish I looked in the Fleet Management tab like Skibbles mentioned but Im fairly new to the game even though Ive played a dozen or so games. Lots of ins and outs Im still figuring out.,masteroforion,d14p5tf,2,t5_2tf8y
7080197,0,t3_4caoen,With regards to the big vs small ships. I sort of finished a game yesterday I am too big now for the AI to kill me off which is a topic of a hole new thread  where I want to stubornly persue big ships with beam weapons. I started to have a fighting chance after phfazers. Before that the graviton weapons while heavy on the damage side were making my production extremely slow to the point where large terran ultrarich used to be toxic before that planet with all the production buildings would need  turns to complete a single battleship.After phasers and especially after disruptors things got very manageable. Where I killed a big fleet blob of  friga ish destroyers and  cruisers with  titans  battleships and  cruisers. k vs k army strenghtSo yes Big ships can perform well but you need latelate game techs to achieve it.

7112891,0,t1_d1m31nv,Yeah it is quite possibly and issue when the game displays D content the thing is memory leaks can be very difficult to find. That being said they will find it eventually and it is early access so these things happen unfortunately. Hopefully they will optimize the tactical combat as well as it runs fairly slowly for me especially when the AI insists on spamming ships.,masteroforion,d1mn0tn,1,t5_2tf8y

7749025,0,t1_d3itgda,Interesting I chose the exact settings you picked  med spiral slow tech pre warp very hard  and I havent found much more challenge in this game than others prior. I was playing as a custom Meklar with Silicoid Psilon Darlok Klackon and Human opponents. Well technically the game is still going but its gotten to the point where Im snowballing out of control.The Silicoid have given me a run for my money but ultimately they didnt press the advantage with their attack only claiming one system from me so their war of aggression was ultimately not that damaging.I definitely have noticed the AI is using Titans properly but on the whole does not seem to be building up fleets in aggregate enough to threaten me.Slow tech does not seem slow at all whatsoever. It barely made a difference.You were right about the pirate problem in the earlygame it was threatening enough to make me change my early game strategy which is nice. They seemed to pop up wherever I stopped directly observing which was cool. The AI fearing me giving me tech seems a bit overboard Ive had at least  techs handed to me for free by the Psilon who I wasnt even directly close to threatening.Perhaps I just got unlucky and had some AI that were strangled by the red warp lines seems to be the case on med spiral for sure but Im still not finding the AI much more challenging than before.uGeneralDirectionWGA I hope this is of some interest to you as a playtest anecdote. If you guys ever want us to send you savegames to show off what we mean feel free to ask just ignore my ship design namesEdit Oh yeah.

We do intend to open the game up to allow creation of new features and modify existing ones but thats a little further down the road. Initially it will be YAML files though that alone will allow you to do quite a bit.Now that were past release Im working on the first info post for our upcoming patches now but I want to make sure I check the backlog one more time after this first round of release feedback.,masteroforion,d71koal,4,t5_2tf8y

8806696,0,t3_50qp1y,I cant speak for the designers but I think the Orion tech seems mainly intended as a means for a productionmilitary player to keep up with other species that have outteched them more than a mostly final set of techs  because you can realistically beat the Gaurdian relatively earlier its more of a race and less of a laststopbeforeAntares kind of thing.Hopefully when the Antaran elements get implemented well see a revision of the way Orion works.I generally just stick with heavy mount Gauss cannons. Plasma rays may be better on paper but the amazing range and shield bypass is just too good IMO.,masteroforion,d76g1mp,2,t5_2tf8y
