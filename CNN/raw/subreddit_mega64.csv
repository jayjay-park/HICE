37066,0,t3_1uj46e,They say it because they know they dont have an actual solid opinion on the topic and instead try to parrot what others say or what the media says in a sarcastic way for humour and to try and deflate the meaning behind it.They always say facetious things for the sake of facetiousness. And its more naivety then a statement or them expressing their views on others. I dont like Eric on the podcast because hes a very insecure person that challenges what everyone says and he goes out of his way to give skype callers a hard time because he has his own personal problems. But I feel that what he said on tumblr wasnt outrageous. And I feel that if you really care about a cause or a subject youre protesting on the street or doing something in your community to make change. And if you really care about something then you wouldnt be scanning media for something offensive and writing it on your blog and your tumblr and trying to feel like you accomplished something and creating a pseudo sense of triumphal spirit and leading an over emotional charge against something that is generally bad but is misplaced and doesnt solve anything.I dont think they shouldve taken down the podcast and pulled the plug on everything. Its like the same thing that happened with Penny Arcade and The Dick Wolves incident. Instead of just leading by example theyre suddenly trying to cover everything up and pretend its better now.,mega64,ceingkz,3,t5_2s4nu

1740345,0,t3_2ed5wi,Id like to hear their take on the situation since they might have a more clear picture on the situation in a podcast being around the industry and all but I dont think they should parody it.  I dont really know what they could even parody here the whole situation is such a cluster fuck that theres not really any one group to make fun of.Mega already kind of made fun of Fish by parodying the Indie Game documentary which was perfect.  Fishs main problem was his pretentiousness and they took the pretentiousness of that documentary down hilariously.However attacking him at this point would be kind of brutal.  I dont like him at all but the retaliation against him was brutal.  I used to like Quinn until this scandal broke but I feel the same.  Shit is already being laid on her pretty hard I think it would be in poor taste to add to it.  Its also just hard to tell what the facts are.The only thing they could really make fun of is maybe how people are so mad that game journalists are corrupt when game journalism was already a huge joke and that this only affects a very niche and largely unimportant part of the development community.,mega64,cjyj88h,9,t5_2s4nu

It enables the user to not only play old games it allows them to experience them. Poque has sent test consoles t other biggest gaming corporations in the world all to no avail.gtThat was when the beta test began.gtOrdinary people were contacted via email to beta test the Meaga. Unbeknownst to them they were to be enslaved and forced to test the console throughout their every waking hour. One tester a student named Rocko  a troubled confused teen  is caught in the eye of the tornado and seeks a way to escape. But until that day Rocko and his comrades must experience one game after another  and make the whole world witness the chaos. gtThis is MEGA!,mega64,clowntg,1,t5_2s4nu

Then fucking blizzard actually did it the absolute mad men. The Closed beta community even had a poll that came out to over k people wanting to keep it in rather then the  that wanted it removed.This is no better then the Jack Thompson shit from early s imagine if they had just said fuck it lets just ban video games its only childrens toys. Its the exact same shit happening in modern media its puritanical games press where everything related to women is misogynistic and an instituationalized effort to suppress women while if its a man then its just a power fantasy that leads to the toxic masculinity which causes men to harass and abuse women.Its fucking bullshit and the more people who keep saying Just ignore them yea Id absolutely love to as soon as they stop trying to ban shit I want to enjoy.,mega64,d1jgxtk,-5,t5_2s4nu
