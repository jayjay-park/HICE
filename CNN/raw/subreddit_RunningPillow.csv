10865724,0,t3_5vahdf,Running pillowI am a paragon player KDUB with about  months invested in the game and I would first like to say Ive really enjoyed your game! Ive found myself constantly in conversation with other helpful veteran players trying to gain their insight and build my deck most efficiently. I soon set goals on gaining multiple paragon levels imagining finally having the advantage against lower paragon players.  I was aiming for the top well maybe not for Francisco that might be a little too optimistic!  The reason I bring this up your post states The biggest complaint obviously came from players WITH HIGH PARAGON LEVELS...As I stated above I am a paragon player with aspirations of gaining the advantages which were recently removed. I will never be able to experience the game the way I was hoping to. I will be honest I was sad after finding out what was going to happen... well let me reword that... not going to happen... more like happened overnight without warning. I am speaking for myself though I would say I am quite active in the chat so I have a feel of others opinions and I think they would agree we thought the heirloom system would be an update which added something to the game gave it a new twist something to reenergize veteran players NOT that it would remove a major part of the game ... It wouldnt be right to complain about changes without thinking a little further and offering a solution or two. I would like to quote your post again Veteran players became too powerful and unbeatable. this is in regard to high paragon levels multiple people are now above paragon level I  agree with you this is a problem. The thing is it is a problem in many waysHigh level players will no longer have to invest money into the game to be at the top because if they stay active no one will be able to catch up to them. The secondary effect of this happening is when newcomers realize what they are up against they will soon understand that is impossible to beat a high paragon deck and furthermore that you will never be able to gain the paragon levels at the rate in which higher paragon levels will continue to grow by this i mean a paragon  is more capable of quickly getting to paragon  than a paragon  to paragon . This may cause people to quit.With that said your solution is to remove the  hpatk bonus. I do not think this is the best option. I have listened and discussed with others about it and a couple of ideas are . Paragon levels should have diminishing returns. By this I mean For each paragon level you gain the bonus is lessened. example pgtp   bonus... pgtp   pgtp   also... pgtp  bonus........  you would decide on the values yourself of course... but by paragon  the bonus would be significantly less than the bonus from paragon to paragon . this would encourage newcomers to hang in for the first paragon to gain the bonus therefore leveling the playing field a bit but still requiring time into the game to get there. At the same time veteran playersor even paragonparagon players who have spent real money on gems in order to paragon fasterwill not lose the advantage theyve grown over a long period of time. There is still an issue that remains the veteran players still have a clear advantage and will still grow in paragon levels much more quickly which means they will not have a need for spending money to stay at the top. A possible solution increasing the player level required based on the level of paragon. Example pgtp  player level ... pgtp   player level ... pgtp  player level ... so by the time paragon gtparagon  required player level .Another way to keep the top players involved and probably the best way is to change the guild system to support some type of guild bank... where top players can help their new recruits in some way besides just crusade bonuses. This would make the player decide do i want to grind out another paragon level right away? or should i wait use my full mythic deck and save resources so i can assist my fellow guildmates as best i can?Long post I know but I am quite upset about the update. The end game i was dreaming for has vanished my planning and time spent evaluating how to optimize my deck and be efficient along the way for nothing. I do not want speak for the whole community but for the VAST majority of people that ive seen in chat are very upset a number of themincluding myself contemplating quitting the game... We dont want to quit as we really enjoy your game!!as shown from the responses.. but i think we just feel at a loss.I for one truly hope you reconsider as the  flat buff is just not enough and the heirloom system seems like a crapshoot and isnt sustainable. I think adding new cards is also a good idea something entirely new without nerfing the current cards without warning because if players have focused on a certain type of card their resources are now gone and their deck is no longer optimal. this would be devastating. There must be a way to allow players who have invested timemoneyenergy into the game to still reap a reward for doing so but yet make it possible for newcomersmid level players to be able to catch up. there should be some advantage but it shouldnt be the rs and then the  others below themTHANK YOU for your time and effort in making changes to keep the game fun and exciting. ,RunningPillow,de0q0gs,1,t5_3j4u0
