542695,0,t3_20bunr,I tried it about a year ago but had to stop because it interfered in how other more important medications were processed in my system. I had been really hopeful about it... though there was the whole Orangered koolaid colored pee and tears.. that was kind of freaky....,Hidradenitis,cg1yliq,1,t5_2sq8b
4403428,0,t1_cslzvfu,Ive been applying deodorant around it but ill definitely stop for now. Its just that I give off a really strong oder and Im starting to get self conscious especially at work. ,Hidradenitis,csm01uz,1,t5_2sq8b
4427022,0,t3_3bng2z,I know how you feel! I have PCOS and suffer from HS in my groinbutt area. As for my personal experience I noticed my weight was the culprit of most of my PCOSHS issues. I would highly recommend change of diet and exercise. I cut out a lot of sugar and carbs that made a huge difference for me. As for temporary relief I am not sure if this is okay for HS someone correct me if this is bad... but I use Clinique acne gel in the area that are causing a lot of pain and it usually helps reduce the size overnightcouple of days. If you would like a buddy to stay on trackFor both HS and PCOS I am more than happy to buddy up and keep each other positive! I went from  to lbs and now back to . My HS walnut size or bigger was horrible when my weight peak from groinbutt down to my knees in the inner thigh area. I also suffered from excessiveloss of hair and missing periods. As my weight drop the breakout started to decline from HS breakout down to my knees to only in my groin and butt area with smallerless painful breakouts. At  I rarely got any! I recently gained lbs and noticed my periods are a bit irregular and more HS breakouts than the past year or so. ,Hidradenitis,csoptyr,2,t5_2sq8b
5382017,0,t1_cvz4xkp,You should really read this   Im almost done and I loved it. Its so nice to finally read up on HS and what causes it and what you could do to stop the flare ups. The most important thing I learned is that it is an autoimmune disease. It has nothing to do with bacteria. Unless one of the boils is infected which happens from time to time why are doctors prescribing antibiotics???? Makes no sense. I cried a lot through out this book. Its nice to know Im not alone.,Hidradenitis,cvzm3b7,1,t5_2sq8b

Look up any skin condition then do a google image search of it dermatologists see some wild stuff. And you already pointed out that they are professionals. Theyre not there to judge you on your appearance this is literally another day at the office for them. Mine actually said some stuff that annoyed mesomething short of a gasp when I showed her and saying something along the lines of you must be embarrassed when you get intimate with people or somethingbut I just interpreted it as her not thinking it was a big deal or a taboo thing that she had to beat around the bush when talking about it. I dunno maybe this helps. I just dont think you should be shy about it at all with your derm. Then again I think most derms are pretty unhelpful with this condition but its worth it to get a professional opinion and have a few goes at medicating it. ,Hidradenitis,d24woj7,2,t5_2sq8b
10311313,0,t3_5nlpga,Hugs its scary as hell at first when you feel alone and helpless. I wouldnt rush to humira when we know there are safe viable and cheap options that work. Heres a copypaste of my journey Im not alone and nor will you beI and hundreds thousands? of others have achieved lasting remission by finding and removing our triggers. There is hope. Zinc mg and turmeric mg twice a day changed my world. A good probiotic and Vit D are useful too.Read The Hidden Plague by Tara Grant. Google Auto Immune Protocol and go to the PaleoMom site.  Join the FB page The HS Diet Connection.  I didnt do the Auto Immune Protocol hard core but I got well nonetheless. My trigger foods are very common nightshade vegetables sugars and processed foods. Even if you started softly by cutting junk food completely and reducing nightshades along with taking zinc and turmeric you will almost certainly improve. HS has its roots in poor gut health the lesions are symptoms not the problem. You can do this dont give up hope. Good luck with your reading. The folks in The HS Diet Connection page are a great source of additional info.Forgive my nonoriginality here my best wishes are genuine and I hope you find your path to wellness soon. XxPs. Inflammation not weight is the problem and antibiotics are only necessary for infections theyre actually unhelpful in the getting well process because they impact gut health so negatively. ,Hidradenitis,dccudfl,3,t5_2sq8b
