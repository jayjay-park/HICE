4649892,0,t3_3dau00,for  your not going to get any decent setup. As its for a business you should be more inclined to invest a bit more to cover yourself legally and provide clear recording. Get a couple Axis PLV which are Infared as well. Use the free version of Milestone NVS which has a couple camera licenses and records for  days.,videosurveillance,ctgoj1z,1,t5_2s9zo

So just plug the camera into a POE injector   then plug that into your wall and login to web page of cam. Use IE itll make life easier unfortunatelyRemote viewing will just require you to forward the appropriate ports in your router. I use IP Cam Viewer Free for mobile viewing.

8238381,0,t3_4s6hfe,Do you have a Multimeter? Can you do basic voltage and resistance test? You may have to do the following to get to the root of your problem.Eliminate the wiring and the DVR. Take the one working camera and connect it directly to the DVR. Then connect it to the next port and the next to verify the DVR is good. Once you determined the DVR is good now take the remaining cameras to the DVR and connect then remove each one after verifying they work. All the while only power up the camera youre testing. Once youve verified the cameras are good then power up  and connect and another until all are connected and working. If youre at this point and they all work directly connected to the DVR the wire is whats left.,videosurveillance,d57cqn2,2,t5_2s9zo

9632016,0,t1_da06o6p, I would also suggest using dielectric grease where possible. The grease makes a huge difference as a last line of defense against moisture.  of course putting the connectors inside a waterproof outdoor electrical box is never a bad idea. You bolt the camera to the box cover and youre done. Theres a product called coaxseal that you put over the outside of a connector and where wires go through walls and so forth.,videosurveillance,da0ce8c,3,t5_2s9zo

9896868,0,t3_5fjab5,The only shortcomings to POE are there are a few standards including some some unusual passive versions i.e. V.amp.  Agree with everyone that this is the absolute best for security cameras.  One of the big advantages is cable can be run without the connectors attached.  After the cable is run connectors are crimped on.  Check out the width of the holes that have to be drilled for some of the analog cables.,videosurveillance,daxl3av,1,t5_2s9zo

11692970,0,t3_66scn8,While I could see the benefit of watching out for family members e.g put a camera outside an elderly mothers housebut otherwise not so much. And even then the issue is that you have no idea when something may happen.Several issues  I dont like my neighbors all that much and am sure the feeling is mutual. They are part of the reason I have cameras... If something happens while I am asleep unless the alarm goes off it can wait until morning when I can playback footage. The whole problem to some degree is that unless someone really has nothing else to do they would have to sit and watch the CCTV feed round the clock and then the chances are the moment they get up to go to the bathroom then the killer clowns come and burn down your house.... ,videosurveillance,dglf01t,1,t5_2s9zo
