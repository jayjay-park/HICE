3303867,0,t1_cp4g5kr,Actually its a very grey area at this time.  The GFSZ law is a federal law which supercedes state laws.  There are exceptions in GFSZ for licensed concealed carry however anyone under Constitutional Carry would not necessarily have a license and would not fall under those exceptions.  Theres also the legal precedent in Kansas gun laws that your car is an extension of your home but again thats a state law and I do not think theres ever been any official case law that tests this against GFSZ.  Personally if you dont have a CCW license I would play it safe and avoid school zones entirely unless you have enough money to be a legal litmus test.,KSGuns,cp4v8jt,2,t5_353fa
4307748,0,t1_csb5m44,Yeah I checked with my gunsmith and he said he didnt want to mess with a Taurus either. I think its a pretty easy fix if you wanted to do it yourself. This is a good guide  ,KSGuns,csb7j07,2,t5_353fa
