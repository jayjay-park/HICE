206101,0,t3_1wh00w,I dont always agree with Ronnie but he was dead on with every point he was making this week.JD should have called the girl he should have a clear plan for after the show and the girl bringing a friend is an easy out for her after the show either for her to slip out or to use as an excuse to leave.I couldnt understand why the rest of the guys werent picking up on Ronnies points  he was being clear and making good ones.Ronnie understands that getting laid when not in a relationship is about two things The right situation  either planned or falling into a situation through blind dumb luck.  At the very least planning something after would increase poor JDs chances especially if booze is involved.  Its about the law of averages and the girl bringing a friend decreases his chances. Confidence.  Something that Ronnie has in spite of his age and small stature and something JD lacks.I have a feeling JD will be going home with Handgelina Jolie and wont come anywhere near getting laid on his date.

Anyways Howard plays a clip from the news where Lisa asks Robin about the results and she just basically says it was bs anmd that Howard is really fucked up. He asks her onair to elaborate and defend her statements and she goes into how like Howard couldnt even watch his kids alone and they had to enlist Robin to come over and help watch the kids while Allison was away lol.Although Im sorry but I cant blame Howard here all that much  multiple kids especially girls must have been hell to deal w for a guy by himself,howardstern,cfrwdnt,1,t5_2qnxc

1475198,0,t3_2b0kgb,I have thought a lot about this myself. Here are my thoughts as a fellow Eric fan His attitudeHe seems to be a decent person but is a complete asshole to Howard and the show. As Artie once put its hard to hate a person who is so disabled but Eric is such an asshole that its not as hard to goof on him.  Schtick vs. realitySometimes its hard to believe Eric could be so gullible. Yes he was probably not exposed to much and coddled as a kid but there have been times where I had to assume he was involved in some of the bits such as the Carey Underwood call or the whole Kendra saga. It really makes you wonder if he is really retarded or brilliant but most likely somewhere in between. A look into the life of a disabled personstalkerNever before have we had such access to this type of person unless you personally know someone who sits at home all day and collects disability. It is fascinating to follow him on social media and see what he does. He is such a big fan of everything from sports to TV shows and even certain brands. Who has time for all of that? His life is just fascinating. Pure entertainmentThe guy is gold whenever he calls in. Even if he has nothing really to say. To hear Howard and Artie when he was on the show react to Eric iswas priceless. One of my favorite YouTube clips is this Artie vs. Eric compilation  The ETM universeThere is now an entire universe of people out there whose entire purpose is to fuck with Eric a la Gonzo Shitcock. These people are almost equally fascinating to me.Overall I just find him fascinating. All of these reasons above dont really even begin to explain it.

One of the reasons for that is to make the show easier to produce and broadcast with the operative word being easier.  He wants to conduct the show and relax.  And then retire.

I listened to the Ed Sheeran interview and he mentioned having dinner with Bill and Christa Miller and Thanksgiving with Jennifer Aniston  so hes part of Howards new inner circle.

Hes his own man now and has to make his own way. I sympathize with Artie and Jackie and Stuttering John and KC and Gange. They all were a victims of the meaner harsher Howard.

The  mil number is only from those first few providers on the first weekend.  I havent seen any other figures out yet but thats a small piece of the financial picture.

Im glad Howardthe show has matured and I like the new direction.  How many pornstars and strippers can he talk to without it getting a little stale? Is the topic of conversation always going to be about someones sex life or when they lost their virginity? Howard has always bitched and whined about everything. Thats his schtick. Hes always been miserable whats different?The show is still outrageous and the wack pack is still going strong. Bigfoot High Pitch and Hanzi are all great currently. He has never been able to focus on every single member at one time. Theres always going to be great shows and some that are just good. Thats how it always was. I honestly laugh about as often to the show as I ever have over the last  years. I get the feeling that a lot of you have started listening in recent years and have listened to so much through youtube that you are comparing the best of to every second of the live show. Weve been spoiled with entertainment in the past couple years.You dont have to listen to every second of every day. Learn to enjoy yourself.  If you actually pay for Sirius there is a wealth of content on the app if the live show isnt doing for you.Another thing I noticed reading some of these comments. Some of you act so entitled. Howard needs to give us what was promised! Give me an example of a radio show thats even on the same level as The Howard Stern Show even now? How can you even act like the past  years at Sirius hasnt given us some of the best radio moments of all time? Maybe you should step outside for a bit.,howardstern,cp73t4h,0,t5_2qnxc

3332676,0,t3_2yaljv,Since Arties podcast?  Arties podcast is like...  weeks old?  Howard hasnt been live the last two weeks.  As narcissistic as Howard is... thats what we love about him.  With Howards schedule and life he leads he doesnt have time to keep tabs on what every single past cast member is doing.  Howard hasnt forgotten Artie.  His name comes up time to time but mostly only when someone calls in and asks Howard about him.  He always says he wishes Artie the best.  But lets be honest... what is plugging Arties podcast going to get Artie?  Anybody that ever listened to the show knows Artie existed.  Moreso than not they would look up Artie to see what hes up to see he has a podcast and listen.  Love Artie or not he has Howards built in audience in his favor.  More listeners to a podcast arent going to do much for Artie.  Artie had a syndicated show and that got canned in less than three years.   Of course Artie has no issues with anybody.  I love Artie and miss him on the show as well... but Artie fired himself from the show and he knows that.  He owns everything he did.  It was destructive for Artie to be on the show.  I also might be in the minority here... but I LOVED Artie on the show.  But Arties standup Artie by himself... just doesnt work for me.  I dont find him funny.  Which I think goes to show that Howard Robin Fred etc... brought the best out of Artie.  Artie cant bring the best out of himself.  He just comes off as overly insulting and says this mostly for shock value.  Shock value isnt funny.  Artie was at his best when he wasnt trying to be funny.

3388323,0,t3_2yzxpl,I just saw something really funny yesterday. It was definitely E show footage when slow Adam was in and Sal as a youngster was feeding lines to him from behind the couch. the beginning of it was really funny.That just reminds me of Benji or anyone else feeding line and that can be a really funny part of the show. Sometimes its really obvious and I bet there are a lot of times when its not.there is so much brilliant stuff on Howards show. As an off the wall question does anyone have good ideas for how to properly introduce nonfans? I mean I have some older family members and I just dont think they understand how many big ridiculously huge smiles and laughs they can get from being in to the show. I think some people who are not into it or are older or whatever have some misconception about the show. They seem to hate it even though really they know nothing about it. I mean Sal might be a moron in a lot of areas but I remember them interviewing him in the Hall one time and hes talking about how the whole show is an inside joke and theres a lot of truth to that. But it didnt take me too long to get into it I mean I was a big time fan from the day I started listening. amp I dont know a lot of things in life are entertaining and funny but I dont think anything has impacted me with laughs smiles and thought as much as the Howard Stern Show.,howardstern,cpehuxi,3,t5_2qnxc

5303564,0,t1_cvpj1ih,First I stopped paying for the show years ago so I get your point. You can always download it for free if you also feel its content isnt worth paying for anymore. Secondly Ive listened for over twenty years. Im no fan of the new PC show. I listen to the thousands of old shows I have on mp more than I listen to the new version of the show so again I know where youre coming from.Thirdly we only have Arties word that hes better now. And to be honest Howard was lied to and fooled many many times over several years about Artie being better. Artie even did coke the first week he was on the show and the weeks before he started. Hes not been entirely clean the entire time he was on to show. It was just different levels of addiction. Hes always been mostly functional so its hard to know when hes truly clean and when hes full of shit. I agree though that it would be compelling radio. The type of stuff old fans have heard before and stayed glued to their radios while it was happening. But again Howard cant just take Arties word for it that hes clean. And there is a lot of hurt feelings feelings of betrayal and a sense that Howard never really knew the true Artie since Artie was pretending to be a non addict since the first day he was ever on the show. All the times off the air Howard talked on the phone and sat him down in his office even having an hour long conversation and arranging for him to see a psychologist that Howard got the number of from his own doctor just for Artie. And then Artie lying about seeing that doctor. He just doesnt want anything to do with Artie. My only problem has been Howard telling Artie when they both accidentally met at the hospital when they both came to visit Robin... Howard said to Artie if he ever needed anything to call. And Artie called three times and Howard never called back. In reality I suppose Howard was just caught off guard by meeting him and wanted to say something nice. But its a dick move to make the gesture and not mean it. That being said hes not obligated. As a friend I feel he is. But I think Howard doesnt feel theyre really friends or ever really were because of how Artie lied since day one. Howard didnt know anything when e hired Artie. His off behavior was made into a running joke on the show because hats how the show has always worked. Listen back to the Jackie Martling days Howard used to bust Jackies balls about everything. Freds fight at a restaurant became a thing on the show. And during that particular show when Fred almost quit technically he did for a day Robin even yelled out something like Youre going to leave us? Were a family. We do everything to each other on the show. You just woke up to that? And she was right. Back then every main staff member sacrificed ever their personal life for the show to make it hugely successful. Marriages who theyre dating love life home life health issues everything became a topic for the air. That all changed when Artie tried to commit suicide and when Robin had her health issue. Suddenly everyone decided that theyre as successful as theyll ever be theyre all millionaires and all getting older... So what else do they have to prove at this point... What else should they have to sacrifice for the show to keep it on top... They can become private people and just talk on the radio for a few hours and go home. And theyre retiring either in December or a year or two. So they changed the rules a bit and now are more reserved in their content for the show. Again I miss the old show and I do have a big problem with the new show. But its about the censorship. Editing out Hanzi by hiring the dump button so  seconds disappears just because he said the name Marci on air. And going back over shows and editing out things like Artie making a joke about Howard being the reason he cant go into rehab. Its like editing out a piece of show history and it bothers me as a fan. But him not wanting Artie on the air I think I understand. That is to say assuming Im guessing right to his reasons. He doesnt see Artie as a friend because of the lies. And he also probably genuinely feels it may mess with Artie head to be on the show in any way. Because Artie may later feel bad that he screwed up his life long dream of working on the show that Artie and his dad used to both listen to before Arties dad died. ,howardstern,cvplbzh,6,t5_2qnxc

Without OnDemand the entire show if were including replays is only available the day it airs on the live channels.  Plenty of people dont listen the exact day the show aired. Not everyone most people? can listen to a replay in full and you can only go back  hours so if you have to pause for a few hours youll lose the spot and miss some of the show.Suffice it to say a lot of the audience relies on the OnDemand shows because we cannot listen to the live feed or replays.

There are a lot more competent and talented stylists out there. Stern doesnt put up with incompetence in his real life. He loves disfunction on the air but in his private life hes nononsense and unwilling to put up with stupidity. Yet there is Ralph not smart and not good at any of his jobs.If Ralph and Howard werent intimate at some point Id be pretty surprised. I do think Ralphs primary job is to procure the menboys and weed and keep things quiet. Remember the condom he couldnt even help Stern lie about to his wife. Think about that level of incompetence. All Ralph had to do was say they were his condoms to Allison and fuck maybe Howard is still married to the broad. Maybe Howard doesnt lose half. Instead Ralph fucks up doesnt lie properly for his boss and shit got Divorcey real quick.Yet theres Ralph throughout the whole ordeal. He never has blame laid on him and hes with Howard pretty much this entire time. I mean just think about how Stern has shit on Artie. Artie is fucking dead to him because he realized he got caught exploiting a drug using loser and doesnt want to be called out on it. Ralph is getting airtime for fucking up Sterns labels in his shirts. ,howardstern,cwa7rbn,3,t5_2qnxc

5709350,0,t3_3tbq41,Its pretty much a done deal. Howards been doing this for a couple decades.When hes going to leave and he knows it he announced it well in advance so the show can go out with a bang. His transition to krock and then to Sirius being prime examples. And when hes going to stay he negotiates until the last week or two usually so he has that pressure to help the other side give him what he wants. Also he always says once the end of his contract happens thats it if it isnt done yet then hes gone. He always has the contract expire at a time when after there is a vacation break. So either way he gets to rest. That adds more pressure because he wont negotiate once his vacation begins. Its either agree or not. He reduced his staff ALOT over the past three years. HTV gone except for a couple cameras. And those I believe are to record content for any future deal with tv or Whalerock. So the only thing to negotiate of he wants to stay is money. Hell want more money to work the same days and hours or take less but allow him to work even less. So IMO thats all theyre negotiating. Money. If Howard didnt want to stay hed of announced hes leaving already and not renewing.His audience isnt as big as it once was. Hes down to about  million listeners according to a Sirius survey done two years ago. Thats still enough to justify his current deal. The only sticking point is whether Sirius will give him a bit more. Because Howard doesnt like accepting a contract where he makes less or the same. His last deal they offered much less so he compromised with working less days and hours. He cant cut back much more. So theyll have to offer the same or more somehow for him to stay. Or... Offer the same but allow the content thats being recorded to be distributed by him so he makes money on he side too. Just like when he had his indemand deal. He signed that Whalerock agreement to provide content several months back. My guess is that was to help him make more once his contract with Sirius came up for renewal.,howardstern,cx4su0o,13,t5_2qnxc

5814819,0,t1_cxgrxzs,gt There are lots of peer reviewed and poorly conducted studies but theres little evidence that TM is better than other relaxation techniques. The Wikipedia entry does a pretty good assessmentHeres what the American Heart Association said about TM and other meditation practices with respect to high blood pressureSummary and Clinical Recommendations page gtThe overall evidence supports that TM modestly lowers BP. It is not certain whether it is truly superior to other meditation techniques in terms of BP lowering because there are few headtohead studies. As a result of the paucity of data we are unable to recommend a specific method of practice when TM is used for the treatment of high BP. However TM or meditation techniques in general does not appear to pose significant health risks. Additional and higherquality studies are required to provide conclusions on the BPlowering efficacy of meditation forms other than TM.gtThe writing group conferred to TM a Class IIB Level of Evidence B recommendation in regard to BPlowering efficacy. TM may be considered in clinical practice to lower BP. Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials all other meditation techniques including MBSR received a Class III no benefit Level of Evidence C recommendation. Thus other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time.Heres what the lead author of the AHA statement said in a Letter to the Editor exchange with a TM researcherResponse to Evidence for Upgrading the Ratings forTranscendental Meditation Response to AHA ScientificStatement on Alternative Methods and BP pdfgt...We do agree that TM is unique in the robustness andquality of evidence among meditation techniques for BPloweringand that a reassessment of the LOE may be warranted should futurestudies particularly using home or ambulatory BP monitoring as theprimary outcome more consistently corroborate its efficacy....Mind you the AHA isnt claiming that TM is the best possible therapy for the treatment of blood pressure or that TM research is the best possible research on blood pressure but in the context of meditation and meditation research TM has sufficient research support to allow the AHA to say that doctors may recommend TM as a secondary treatment of high blood pressure and that the research to allow the AHA to say that for other meditation practices isnt there yet.In fact the only longterm multiyear study on mindfulness that studied blood pressure that I am aware of saysEffects of stress reduction on cardiovascular risk factors in type  diabetes patients with early kidney disease  results of a randomized controlled trial HEIDIS.gtParallel to the reduction of stress levels after  year the interventiongroup additionally showed reduced catecholamine levels p lt . improved hmean arterial p lt . and maximum systolic blood pressure p lt . as well as a reduction in IMT p lt .. However these effects were lost after  and  years of followup..TM is a simple relaxation practice that is easily mastered or has no mastery as it is too simple. The EEG found in a year TMer is pretty much the same as found in a year TMer.On the other hand mindfulness and concentrative practices ARE something  you master. THe EEG in a year practitioner is strikingly different than a year practitioner and it shouldnt be a surprise that the effects of the practice change over time. Something that shows up in a year practitioner may not show up  eyars later because the practice is different.Not so with TM TM is TM is TM. Beginners all of us either at  year or  year or masters all of us....And so there IS evidence that TM and other practices are different and become more different as time goes on. What these differences are and how they matter is the subject of ongoing studies but not headtohead studies. Noone does headtohead studies on meditation. The schools of thought are such that Buddhistoriented researchers cant see the benefits of mindwandering TM and TM researchers are content to focus on TM while everyone else chases the mindfulness fad.,howardstern,cxhvrx2,1,t5_2qnxc

6023680,1,t1_cy96tz1,You are giving Howard too much credit.  Yes he was great at finding what made people interesting and funny but back in the day he would let Billy and Jackie just run wild and sit back and get them back on track if they ever veered off point and Artie go wherever he wanted before he got diarrhea of the mouth when he got hooked on heroin. And Jackie and Fred wrote most of the questions for John.And I would argue Fred was just as intrical in making Scott interesting.  It was his impression of Scott that got legendary.  Howard copied it but Fred was the one who created it.  What made the Stern Show so good is that it was a great collection of talent.  Howard just channeled it well.  I think you see today that Howard alone cannot make a person interesting see Memet and Shuli for example.  ,howardstern,cy986ky,2,t5_2qnxc

6048437,0,t3_3y9024,I got that for Christmas  years ago from my Uncle Chuck.  My mom had five brothers and all lived outside of society and the law but none more than my Uncle Chuck. My parents were a little perplexed why my barely literate uncle gave me a book for Christmas but I understood why I would skip school as a th and th grader and go to his house and if I cleaned his guns I could drink all the beer and smoke all the cigarettes I could before pm when I had to get back for postlunch attendence. While I was dissembling Mossbergs Browning and SampWs drinking PBRs and smoking reds and low grade weed Howard Stern was playing on . WMMS being broadcast into our backwater section of Northeast Ohio.  We listened to Howard while we did the above. The show mentioned the book nonstop during the timeframe of initial publishing. I mentioned only once to my uncle that Id like to read that and Id wait until could get it in the local branch of the Akron Public Libray.Christmas morning under our tree was a gift from Uncle Chuck only to me I have  siblings. It was the hard copy of Private Parts. I read the entire book in one night. I wanted to read it to my uncle and I think he wouldve wanted me to but he never asked and I couldnt figure out a way to offer.Since Ive read that book Ive read maybe  more but that book is on of my top  for many reasons.

Bob Levy is literally the worst comedian whos ever lived Artie being a close second in my opinion and when they act like petulant children Howard rightfully steps back and says I dont need you and you need me.

The buildout for the guest facilities would be more elaborate insofar as aesthetics are concerned and include  toilets and  latrines. All others would simply need to be to code. This isnt rocket fucking science and just goes to show how little Stern is willing to invest in his employees and guests. I was told that a total redux was applied to their green rooms.

8510577,0,t1_d64vjme,Agree.With the show playing on a loop everyday plus segments repeating on Thursday and Friday a very regular listener is likely to hear an celebrity interview many times over the course of a week whereas Howard does the interview and moves on.  As a result we have the minutiae of each guests life beat into us until we cant forget whereas Howard immediately forgets those same details.  The end result is that repeat interviews often feel unnecessary and repetitive.  I dont blame Howard for this fact.  Its just the way it is.  I just think repeat guests.... or guests that arent terribly interesting... do NOT need the  minute interview each and every time they have something to plug.  Reserve the endlessly long interviews for people with long varied careers who arent likely to come back.,howardstern,d65dmg4,1,t5_2qnxc

For JD he was just having fun and busting balls with HPM. but when somebody did it to him he was bent out of shape. I think Robin made the comment first that HOM and JD would have been in the same circle in high school. JD denied that. Fans give JD a lot of slack for being a good guy but just socially awkward. I dont agree. He really is a prick. JDs fight with a female intern is another perfect example. He just couldnt process how he was wrong with his interaction with her.,howardstern,d66t248,3,t5_2qnxc

9787328,0,t3_5faibp,Question for longtime fans Im a  year old guy whos just getting into Howard for the first time thanks to my fiancee. I reactivated the radio in my car just to listen to him on my morning commute. And Ive spent a lot of time on Youtube the last few weeks checking out all of Howards interviews with my favorite celebrities over the years.EVERY community has the subset of fans that says this sucks now the old stuff was better but Howards fans online seem to be even more vocal on the topic than usual. And an overarching theme is the PCification of the show over the years. My question to anyone listening for longer than  years is is it true? I wasnt into the speech impediment man segment this morning and when I read that it reminded others of Bikram I remember how lame I thought that was last week or two weeks ago whenever it was.It does kinda seem like the great moments are interspersed with some others that fall flat. But you expect any innovative show thats on  times a week to do that sometimes. Did the ratio of hilarious to meh change over time? And what caused it was it Beth?On a related note Howards love of Hillary Clinton is also a little odd. The Israel thing I can understand even if I dont agree with it. I guess I am wrangling with who I thought Howard was vs who Im finding out he really is now that Im listening. ,howardstern,daji1vb,5,t5_2qnxc

In fact the merger didnt cure their financial problems and they had to give up controlling interest of the company to Liberty Media for a loan to keep the lights on.You are buying into Howards spin.  The fact is that both companies were bleeding money and combining companies would allow them to lower costs.  gtA big reason Sirius and XM want to merge is that they stand to save hundreds of million dollars in costs Oprah and Howard Stern are expensive. Those savings will make satellite radio more competitive.I am speaking truths and facts and not lies.  ,howardstern,db3lobm,2,t5_2qnxc

Mostly Bad. . amGary came in and told Howard that they heard from Carmen Electras publicist that shes upset about the story about her going out with Jamie Foxx because its just not true. She wasnt even out over the weekend according to her publicist. Howard said hes angry with the story too because he doesnt want her to be out with Jamie Foxx. Howard told Gary to get Carmen on the phone because he wants to hear it from her.Howard said they get a lot of wacky songs from fans so he played a few of them. Richard came in and said they actually get some good songs too. Howard played two bad ones and then a good one according to Richard. That bands song was sent in by one of the guys aunts. Howard thought it was a lot to take but it was pretty good. He said hes not sure hed buy that song but he doesnt really buy any songs.Howard played one commercial parody about a cum paste that went on for  minutes and  seconds. He didnt know where they were going with the bit and it was just way too much stuff in it. He said a mad man must have written that bit. He continued to play it just to find out what they did for the rest of the  minutes and  seconds that he hadnt heard. Howard said they should call the guy and tell him hes a genius as a joke of course.Sal came in and said that the Cum Paste bit was the best out of  tracks the guy had on his CD. Howard told Sal to get a phone number for the guy so he could call him. Sal just stood there not doing anything so Howard had to tell him to get the number again.There was still a minute left on the awful bit. Artie said that the bit was actually making him angry because it was way too long and it was wasting his time. The chick in the commercial kept saying sperms too which was pissing Robin off. Every time it sounded like the commercial was over it had more time on it. There were  seconds left so Howard finished it up. He said he was going to just replay that bit over and over again during the replays of the show just to piss the audience off.Richard told Howard there were some other good things on his list. There was a song from Crotch Duster that he liked. Howard played that and a few other things. There was a rap song that sounded okay to him. He said it didnt sound any different than the songs they play on the Top  list. Richard had Howard play a bunch of other ones that he thought were okay.Jerking Greg Around About His Lame Cum Paste Bit. . amSal told Howard that Will had the guy who did that awful Cum Paste commercial on the phone. He was all shaky and nervous because he had trouble finding the CD and the guys information. He said some very creepy things about how he knows Howard can be hard on him and he wished that he could be hard on him more. Howard kicked him out and got this guy Greg on the phone.Howard told Greg that he did a great job on the commercial he sent in and made him feel like he had done the greatest bit ever. The guy said he does all kinds of erotic stuff and writes a ton of things. He asked Greg why he made the commercial go for over  and a half minutes. He said hes made some of them over  minutes long.Greg had no idea that Howard had been ripping on him because he was on vacation in Palm Springs. The guy said hes been a roofer for  years and he does this stuff on the side. Howard asked him what kind of money it would take to get him to work there. He told him to keep his wife out of it because he was sitting right next to her. Howard asked Greg what it would take to get him there. Greg said hes just getting into this stuff and hes not sure. Artie broke in and told the guy he should get an agent before making a deal.Howard asked Greg what he would charge him for the exclusive rights to the Cum Paste bit. Greg didnt know. Tim Sabean came in and asked what they need to get this guy on the show. Greg said this is crazy and its right on the spot so hes not sure. Artie told him to make sure he retains the rights to the bits.Howard and Tim asked him once again what kind of money he wants but Greg wasnt able to come up with a number. He said he would need a couple hundred thousand a year maybe  a year. Howard told Tim this might be a good deal and said that he might sign him for  a year for five years.Greg said that they need to get together to discuss business. Howard told Greg he didnt want to have a meeting and he would give him  but they would retain the rights to the bits. Greg said he had to talk to his wife quickly. He spoke to her and we could hear her talking about his Volume   and .Artie told Greg that for  a year they want him to roof Freds house. Another guy called in and offered Greg  after telling him that his Cum Paste bit was genius. It was just Sal calling in from the office. Doug Goodstein came in and said that they could give him an additional  to turn his bits into TV shows. That would bring his salary up to  there at SIRIUS.Howard asked Greg about the Cum Paste bit and why the woman is moaning as shes brushing her teeth. Greg explained the bit to him and said his idols are Dice Clay and George Carlin. Robin told Greg that they almost mistook his bit for one of Sal and Richards. Greg said hes got enough material for about  or  CDs. Howard asked him if theyre all as good as Cum Paste. Greg said that theyre all great.Howard broke the news to Greg that his bit is one of the worst things hes ever heard and that they were jerking him around. Riley Martin called in and said that he never heard from Tim Sabean yesterday when he was supposed to. He said that Tim must be as shady as the rest of the motherfuckers there. Howard asked Tim what was going on there. Tim said they got backed up and they will call Riley today.Howard said he heard that Riley had asked for  million to do his show. Riley said that wouldnt even buy toilet paper for Howard. Hes ready to go to full time now.Howard told Greg that they were just dicking around with him and hed better stay in the roofing business. He told him he knows hes trying but its just not working. He told him that the bit wasnt funny and it just went on and on and on. Greg tried to defend the bit saying it was hilarious but Howard said it was awful and he should just give it up now. Greg told Howard to listen to some of the other bits before he decides. Artie told Greg that what they just did was funny his bit was not.Greg suggested that they listen to some of his other bits before deciding about the whole CD. Howard saw some of the tracks like Pussy Eating Machine and Cum Gum so Greg suggested the Pussy Eating Machine bit to listen to. Howard found the track and tried to play it but the CD wouldnt play in his machine. He tried another bit called One Eyed Jack. Artie was laughing at the bit but he wasnt laughing at how funny it was he was laughing at how bad it was. Howard was  seconds into the bit and said they didnt know what the hell he was talking about. He did correct himself and said that the Cum Paste bit wasnt the worst hes heard this One Eyed Jack bit was the worst.Howard asked Greg what it would cost them to get every copy of this CD destroyed. Greg wasnt so happy at this point. Howard found another clip called You Got Fucked at the DriveThru. That one was horrible as well. Howard asked him how all of his bits could have nothing funny in them. Greg said that maybe Howard just doesnt laugh at things that are funny. Artie told Greg that he should keep going through life like this because hell always be happy that way.Greg put his wife Victoria on the phone so Howard told her how horrible the whole CD was. She said theyve sent it to other places as well and they have more bits on a full CD instead of the demo disc that they have. She said she would overnight them a copy of the full CD if he wanted. Howard played another bit called Spermaholic after she told him it got a great response at this event they went to. The bit was going nowhere so Howard cut it off. Fred told him that it was just getting good so he got back to it.Howard asked Victoria if she actually saw people laughing at this stuff. She said people were laughing right at the start. She claims that girls were into the CD and bought the CD at this event they were at. Howard took a call from a guy who said that he thinks this is the biggest piece of horse shit hes ever heard. Victoria said that they think this CD is great and it doesnt matter if people dont like it. She didnt like that they called them to goof on them. She said if they didnt like the CD they didnt have to call them and goof on them. Howard told Victoria he had to get going so she got off the phone very quickly after thanking him for that.,howardstern,dbg07am,2,t5_2qnxc

I could go rob a liquor store but it doesnt mean I am guilty if one gets robbed in my area.  Also how would HPE wanting to get laid translate into him killing his best friend?  Why would some random chick try to convince HPE to kill Joey?  What would they gain?  Also if Joey had his money in the bank then died remember his death was high profile HPE could only get it if he was his POD beneficiary.  Maybe he is maybe he isnt but something by tells me he wasnt.  Joey would have know that HPE isnt really responsible enough to fill that role.It sounds like you want this poor guy to be guilty if only for your own selfish libelous amusement.Also do we really think HPE has it in him to kill Joey and cover it up?  A person capable of being scammy and being a thief is one thing but being capable of murder and a coverup is another.  This would be a tall order for a healthy person.

10308541,0,t1_dcc7c91,gt Two its set up like all reality shows. The producers tell them to cry tell them to reshoot scenes. While youre correct that The Bachelor is fake no youre wrong thats not exactly how the show goes down.Shows like the Bachelor use manipulation isolation creative editing and the casting of mentally unstable people in order to get what they want. However they dont simply tell the contestants what to do and say. If youve ever seen a layperson try to act on camera then youd know that most people are pretty horrible at acting and cant just cry on cue convincingly. Its much easier to find  mentally unstable people a season than it is to find  excellent actors.Yes the show is fake in the sense that producers will lie to and manipulate contestants to evoke reactions and use very creative editing to create moments on screen that never really happened.There are also some highprofile reality shows that are softscripted meaning there are scenarios planned by the producers and played out by the onscreen personalities but the lines themselves are not scripted. Softscripted reality shows are usually the ones where the onscreen personalities are on the payroll Kardashians real housewives jersey shore ect. rather than shows with a changing roster of crazy loosecannon contestants.  Then there are a handful of reality shows that are completely scripted but those are mostly random barely known shows on poorly rated cable networks. They rarely ever get popular because theyre just too painfully fake for most people to enjoy.I have a friend who was a cameraman on The Bachelor for a couple of seasons. And have had other friends who have worked as editors and production assistants on reality shows so I have a little bit of inside information here.Yes The Bachelor is fake but it doesnt play out the way you described. The contestants on the show are not specifically told what to do but are rather manipulated into those reactions. Its a subtle distinction but if you are going to critique authenticity then you should be correct in your critique.  ,howardstern,dccj1ou,3,t5_2qnxc

Thats pretty great. But using your base of  million listeners who are spending like month but likely more based on number of devices internet and app access hes pulling in mm or myear.

10706636,0,t3_5t4k3o,After listening to this segment again there is absolutely no way that anyone can think that Howard owes Artie a damn thing. He tried so hard to help Artie get his life in order and Artie just never wanted the help. This is just one little example. There are countless others. People wonder why Howard wont talk to Artie and hasnt had him back on since he left. This is one reason. Obviously the constant up and down with the drugs and the bashing of Howard the past few years probably plays more into it. I would bet anything that at some point if Artie had cleaned his act up after the suicide attempt and got his life going in a positive direction Howard would have sat down and talked to him. Artie truly was a funny guy and added some great bits to the show but hes a shell of whatever he was  years ago. It really is sad that the only people he surrounds himself with are enablers. I know people think at a certain juncture in time Howard started becoming an enabler and was just feeding off of Arties issues for bits. I dont really believe that. We do know that behind the scenes Howard had tried to get him help many times. There came a time though when Howard probably figured that there was only so much help he could give and if Artie wouldnt accept it then there was nothing else he could do. Artie was going to be Artie. I am suprised a little that Artie wasnt asked to leave around  when the herion abuse started getting really bad. Maybe Howard figured that letting him go would be the end of Artie. Who knows? ,howardstern,ddkb5sw,8,t5_2qnxc

11281162,0,t3_60zyms,The concept of Sternthology in general is pretty complex. Like any creative environment its better to have teams coming up with stuff so assume multiple people for every role.  You need the people at the top who will listen to the days Stern show the this day in Howard history TWUS or the news in general and come up with ideas for Sternthology.  You probably need  maybe  people for this because what one person has  years of radio memorized?  Now its important to remember that even though every Sternthology episode is about  segments long they come up with  and let their bosses decide.  Its usually Gary or Jason who make the final call on what hits the air on .  For the  people who selected those segments they each have an internengineer or two who will individually pick through the archives and find the tapes themselves. You have to assume that the archive is not really like Google where you can type in keywords and get results they have a complex system that theyve mastered and need to be able to navigate quickly.  This team of internsengineers will pass it of to the engineers responsible for masteringediting and once again it makes it way back to the producers. I wouldnt be surprised at all if Sternthology required about  people to successfully broadcast.  Apply that logic to the rest of the show and you get the picture. ,howardstern,dfapbo9,2,t5_2qnxc

11383116,0,t1_dfm747d,See I cant compete with your intimate knowledge of Howards schedule. You must be part of the  of elite out there so Im honored that youd even take the time to respond. The fact that you think a guy can schedule his day every day living in the city and can just count on being there at  am without traffic or any other factors turn things on and go live is comical.  The analogy definitely holds up but apparently like everything else you just try your best to punch a hole in it rather than understand the comparison. You could have very easily just said. The analogy doesnt work one guys name is Howard and the other one is named Steve it doesnt translate. But by proxy you proved yourself wrong by saying that he isnt involved in whats going on yet He is the brand and He is the product. Since you are so inclined to shoot down peoples analogies for the record guys like Kimmel and Fallon still have another  years to go before they will be on a Stern type level from a longevity stand point and well theyll likely never reach it from a financial standpoint but thats another point entirely. Curious how many  to  days you think Letterman was working before he walked away? Since we are just going to use the entertainment sector as a comparison Ill be patiently awaiting your answer since Im sure you have intimate knowledge of his schedule as well like most A listers apparently. Its obvious that you actually love the show at least enough to be here going back and forth with me about it. I wish you the best brother try to stop and smell the roses and dont look back and long for the days of old. He wont ever go back to that style money the format and everything else is working against that.

11658592,0,t3_66b7ok,The show has changed But how could it not? In the s and s Howard was fairly combative and uber competitive. But he got older and more comfortable as we all do. When he moved to satellite ratings were no longer an issue he has been paid between  million and  million a year. He got remarried. This will change anyones viewpoint on life. Marci Turk is not the cause of the changes. She may be one of the results of the changes. Howard is likely nearly a billionaire by now. He is the elite he used to rail against. Not a criticism. Just a fact. For those decrying that the show is no longer real  how real do you think it would be if Howard pretended to be the same guy he was  years ago despite his enormous wealth and privilege? Hes not the same guy. Nor should he be. Who in world wants to hear a  year old ogling the latest whore on the Sybian? The whole AGT thing was to move into the mainstream. So is booking mainstream guests. Howard has been moving this direction for years. Marci Turk is made the scapegoat by unhappy fans stuck in the past almost entirely due to Arties uninformed gossip fueled by bitterness. Howard is winding this show down. And hes doing it on his terms.   ,howardstern,dghil44,10,t5_2qnxc
