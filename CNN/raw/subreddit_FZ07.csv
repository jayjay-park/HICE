3885458,0,t1_cqz4h4g,I ended up getting mine from a dealer in Toledo OH for just under k OTD. Dealer near me quoted me close to  so the drive was very worth it. Glad to hear you got one for a good deal!,FZ07,cqz6c7k,1,t5_34hiv

6810355,0,t3_47y37q,How do you like the muffler? I had a Two Brothers slipon my Ninja from Previous Owner and loved it but Im not sure how it sounds on the Fz. I know the one for the Fz sounds nice.As for the mirrors do you still have the mounts for the stock mirrors? Do you lane split? I hate having to adjust my mirrors every time I take off my bike cover so these might remedy that but Im worried about the extra clearance these may add when lane splitting.,FZ07,d0o91bl,1,t5_34hiv
6886206,0,t3_4a21nl,Hows that helmet?They are insanely light and the liner felt nice but Im worried about noise and build quality.,FZ07,d0wv9o4,1,t5_34hiv
6906830,0,t1_d0yg42e,I dont really know where the stripe is from if its original or not. I want to replace it with some type of yellow stripe just to keep the black and yellow theme ,FZ07,d0z7inj,1,t5_34hiv

7389686,0,t3_4ghnyh,Dont you guys feel any slack in the drive line when doing this Throttle onoffon stuff? It kind of reminds me of my old car when the motor mounts went bad surely that cant be good for the transmission no?,FZ07,d2i5np4,1,t5_34hiv
7470725,0,t1_d2nnbsv,So youre saying I should get better performance out of regular ethanol based  octane? Thats intriguing. Ive got  miles on mine and have never tested. ,FZ07,d2rdk01,1,t5_34hiv
7571511,0,t1_d32qv55,Yea it depends on your area. I live in BC Canada and its about  a month for me.Our bikes are predominantly insured based on engine size more so than the class of bike though its stupid I know. Theres a few exceptions with red dots next to them where the insurance people ask you to sit down before making you pay Honda CBR  Fireblade etc,FZ07,d32ue0j,1,t5_34hiv
7764092,0,t3_4hm7sf,Late to the party but anyway..It was the nd day I owned my FZ. I was riding with my buddy who has a Kawasaki ZRX..he took from a red light like a rocket..got just to the other side of the intersection and let off the throttle. Me trying to keep up and be cool I took off fast and saw that he was slowing down so I slowed down too. RIGHT AS I SLOW DOWN he guns it again..and me not knowing any better..SO DID I. Basically chopped st gear and slammed it open again. And then..BOOM. Im looking at the clouds feet fallen off the pegs white knuckled on the throttle. Found the clutch lever and pulled it in and slammed the front end down as well as my manhood. Jake likes to remind me on occasion of hearing me in our headsets going OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK until I brought it down. I hope that made sense haha.,FZ07,d3opswi,1,t5_34hiv
7795314,0,t1_d3s7po7,I would say theyre certainly bright enough but they are a little bit less noticeable. All the orange plastic on the stock signals really helps them stand out when theyre illuminated. With the LEDs youre getting a much more focused light source coming from inside smoked plastic so its a bit more subtle. Theyre still bright and Im not worried about people not seeing them.,FZ07,d3s92wc,1,t5_34hiv
7816383,0,t1_d271r6n,One downside is it cant fit a laptop...maybe a  incher if I stuffed it.,FZ07,d3umjp4,1,t5_34hiv
7833297,0,t3_4mka19,I got lucky finding mine. Lots of the other two colors available all over but mine was the only available in a few hundred mile radius at the time. Id be interested in hearing the details about production numbers and color combos of all the  series bikes. ,FZ07,d3wj3qq,2,t5_34hiv
7960027,0,t1_d4aqojc,No reset. I rode the bike around a few days while they ordered the new gauge so my mileage is off by miles now. ,FZ07,d4as60r,1,t5_34hiv
7980959,0,t1_d4d31i7,you basically have to point the beam at the ground to not blind anyone.The retrofit can easily be done in a day on the weekend,FZ07,d4d4v94,1,t5_34hiv
8102826,0,t1_d4qth5m,Sorry didnt give a good description I definitely wouldnt modify the factory tank covers. Plan to notch the piece itself assuming there is enough material. I was in a rush tonight to get home and didnt really play with it.,FZ07,d4qtx02,1,t5_34hiv
8265604,0,t1_d5a5f3h,Yes i dont think they provide the racket set with the attachments.  So you have to have those. ,FZ07,d5araxg,1,t5_34hiv
8307137,0,t1_d5fwjm6,Attempts to turn but wont do it kickstand up down all around no difference same with in st or neutral. For whatever reason I hopped on to leave work it started no problem stopped to get a drink had to roll start it again,FZ07,d5fy5xi,1,t5_34hiv

8856386,0,t1_d7c5w8p,Haha yeah the lights are ugly but I would rather have someone notice them than not. I decided just to roll with it since I had finished almost the entire install and wanted to be able to ride. It works really well for the price! I would definitely recommend it. ,FZ07,d7ceuvz,2,t5_34hiv

9393272,0,t1_d96lkq7,Hey I appreciate all the insight. The most optimal situation for me would be to buy a preouned model from my local deanship. I am honestly not interested in a new bike I mean it would be cool but let be honest it doesnt matter. There actually is a bike with  miles at my deanship thats up for k. Ill be taking a look at it this weekend. Thanks to all the comments I now have a decent insurance rate an awesome bike to purchase and an affordable and economic way to purchase it. Now I just need to get the ball rolling assuming the bike checks out. ,FZ07,d96nwmt,1,t5_34hiv
