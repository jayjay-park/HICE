685379,0,t1_cgi4nrg,I had trepidation about using my old still active student email for this but seeing the ridiculous prices Im reupping anyway screw Autodesk. Ill get a free legal copy of the software I need build up my portfolio and have zero regrets. I feel my old faculty would support my decision.,3DMA,cgi6g54,1,t5_2r4ei
776994,0,t3_230wan,Hello!TLDR Your problems might be due to baking a highpoly object onto another identical highpoly object. Why are you doing this?So wellHighPolyNoTurbo is hardy a low poly version at .k tris. You seem to have been baking a highpoly model onto another highpoly model.This is very strange and I cant begin to wrap my head around why you are doing this and then retopoligizing.  Or why you are using a normal map at all for this and not smoothing groups because in some instances such as where the rope is wound around the crossbar it would give a smoother result than your current method.Anyway I threw them into UnityCan you tell which one has the normal map and which one doesnt?Neither can I. I promise one does. Regardless I was unable to find the errors you mentioned in the model in my version of unity.I see them in the normal map and it looks like it could be due to a lack of padding but honestly they are miniscule and youre trying to bake detail onto an almost identical mesh. Might be making weird shit happen.,3DMA,cgsljzr,2,t5_2r4ei

4536066,0,t3_3d3332,I believe the workflow for current gen characters is to  create a low poly all quad base mesh  import into a D sculpting application such as Mudbox or Zbrush and sculpt your character starting with low frequency details and slowly working your way to high frequency details  create your low poly mesh by retopologizing your high poly mesh  unwrap and bake normals.      If you can drawsculpt human anatomy pretty well then the most difficult part of these steps is getting accustomed to the software. ,3DMA,ct2eim9,1,t5_2r4ei

6294466,0,t1_cz53ufi,Thanks! Its Corona. The cork cover imperfections are simply a bercon noise map driving the bump no displacement and no modeling due to time limitations. DThe berries are similar just squashed and mistreated spheres with some stuff modeled onto them then scattered with Coronas excellent scatterer randomizing scale and rotation. Color variations come from Coronas multimap function.Edit DO post the bottle! Id like to see more posts on rdma. ,3DMA,cz53yez,1,t5_2r4ei

8047825,0,t3_4pffi6, small things bother me On one hand the leather seems a little worn dirty... but the blade is as clean as it comes. You might want to commit to one look or the other.The other is that the blade couldve used a few more polygons for the Blade as the reflections and shape are somehow a little bothering. If you went through the process of adding so much detail to the handle do so for the blade itself.Other than that really good. Especially for  year of experience. Keep improving,3DMA,d4kng9k,3,t5_2r4ei

9130565,0,t3_55bjlc,Theoretically the only way to do it is with Motion capture of some sort. Some methods are cheaper than others. And some have limitations. I dont know much about motion capture but if youre on a budget maybe try using an Xbox kinect or something. Pftrack has point tracking maybe do some tests where you tape ping pong balls to a suit and track it manually. Would be time consuming but feasible. Otherwise you could try recording someone dancing and use it as reference and animate it manually. Maybe research nuke. It has some sort of point tracking function that allows you to get meshes from video. Maybe try posting in rvfx ,3DMA,d89d53d,1,t5_2r4ei

9573355,0,t1_d9t3jvs,Why do you need a d model for a d printed image? Draw d bananas that look D. It should not be too much fun work and learning if you are seasoned since middle school however long that is passionate about design person. If you are on internship there should be someone there who you could ask how would you tackle this challenge. There is more than one way to peel a banana.Edit removed some snark and added link. ,3DMA,d9t40my,4,t5_2r4ei

10735454,0,t3_5tl09v,It looks like youre interested in everybodys favourite cephalopod. Did you know that octopuses have been observed using coconut shells as a defensive tool? Tool use was once thought to be unique to humans but has since been observed throughout nature.This bot was created to share the remarkable complexity of the cognitive lives of octopuses.
