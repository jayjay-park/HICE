6846942,0,t1_d0se08e,The Field Notes are soft cover and thats part of the beauty. It gets bent beat to hell and creased but remains totally usable. Also because they dont have a ton of pages theyre really thin and I dont notice sitting on it. Usually I cant stand notebooks getting bent or mangled but these become infinitely more usable by having them immediately available in a pocket as opposed to in a bag. Theyre just more accessible and by that fact more likely to get used. The small size has been both good and bad. Its convenient and unobtrusive to pull it out jot a note and slip it back into my pocket. It doesnt however lend itself well to longer writing pieces. As for my style I have to confess I actually have  notebooks. I use my Field Notes for quick and dirty note taking. Going to the home brew shop for grains? I write my grain bill down in the Field Notes and cross it off as I gather at the store. At a get together and somebody asks me to bring them a DVD next time I see them? I add a check box and the task to my notebook and back into my pocket it goes. Short term tasks ie can be completed in under  minutes I just do and then check as complete. Larger tasks I move out of my notebook and schedule in my calendar. Then I strike through the task in my notebook to indicate its been moved.I keep reviews for whiskies and beers Ive tried in my Field Notes and really thats as long form as I get with that notebook. I actually do my daily journal in a moleskine that lives in my backpack. But thats more a concise record of my day instead of something that is going to require actions. More a record for posterity. ,bulletjournal,d0seokx,3,t5_33po3

I used to lose lists and notes all the time and it was a bit of an organizational disaster especially with my memory getting increasingly worse. I adopted the journal in February and it was basically the last step to bring my whole organizational system together and make it functional.Both work and personal go in the same journal but I will double check with certain clients to make sure theyre comfortable with meeting notes being a part of it since theres occasionally a tight NDA. If thats the case Ill keep the notes digital but it doesnt happen often.The personal part of my book gets a little personal but I also have a separate longform journal journal for really personal things so it wouldnt be a big deal if somebody read through my bullet journal. Id HATE it but it wouldnt be a disaster. My personal bullet journalling tends to be more hobbyside job focused rather than mental health stuff although that creeps in. I still decorate a bit I like to put a sticker or stamp somewhere on every spread when Im doing my dailies just because it makes me happy and for my normal job stuff thats not a thing Im not ashamed of it and I dont feel judged for it. If Im in a client meeting Ill flip to a blank spread anyway for notes so for more staunch clients its not an issue. It does keep me from going overboard somewhat but that works out for me because I like the process of overdecorating more than I like the results. ,bulletjournal,darw7qt,2,t5_33po3

10114330,0,t3_5kpyv9,The only real requirement is something to write with and something to write on. Everything after that is optional depending on what you want to get out of your BuJo. For my first BuJo that was the Index a Book and Movie Collection and the daily log. The Index was super obvious to me after I had finally been introduced to the concept. I use it to keep track of major events happenings etc so I can quickly reflect on them. Rarely when I need to add some new special page to my journal it also goes here since its obviously not right up front in the book. The next thing for me is my Book and Movie collection. This is just a list of things that Ive actually read or watched over the life of that BuJo. I dont use this as a want to list as I find that for me those sort of lists end up getting ignored and dont reflect back to me what Ive actually done. Finally I have my daily logs. This isnt much different than the defaultstandard approach you see most people doing. The only distinction in mine is that I dont do much task management here as I find it too easily lost. Instead I use Any.do for those and use my daily logs to denote that Ive actually done them. This makes my entire book more of a list of accomplishments and a history of me than of a planner or a todo list. Everything else such as the FutureMonthlyWeekly Logs and spreads as well as most task management stuff Ive skipped out on as I find digital tools work far better for me on those things. Specifically Any.do and their calendar app Cal have solved my needs there. I also dont go deep into all the artsy stuff as I find it way too distracting for me also Im terrible at it. ,bulletjournal,dbpwm9b,6,t5_33po3

10145304,0,t3_5kx51l, Ive ditched my future log for  completely. It might be something I regret later but I noticed last year that I just never remembered to log things there and then migrate them back into the new month. Instead I have added two sections to my monthly spread. I have a section labeled next month for events or appointments that happen the next month obviously and a keep me in mind section which essentially acts as my future log for eventsappointmentsnotes for later months. It should be noted that my job doesnt allow for very much future planning.

Water color supposedly crinkles the paper but doesnt bleed I like the small A. I could probably do a day per page but maybe not. I like the covers you can buy with the notebook. I like the format of months and dailies. I like the tabs down the side for months.Reasons I will not buy one  I love my A leuchtturm. I like the size and all I can cram on a spread. I love that it has numbered pages and a table of contents. I like that if I need  pages for one day or  lines for one day I wont waste paper. Except those spreads that are absolutely needed and then I never go back to them I have decided to buy a Staology notebook before a hobonichi because the paper is comparable and its cheaper. Without preprinted dates. Also I just love the bullet journal system. I feel Id waste   and then not fill up the book.Now once I get a Staology notebook and see how my ink works with it and how I use it in conjunction with my bullet journal I may go ahead a buy a hobonichi.

11712065,0,t3_674jis,Ive started bullet journaling few months back and I still experimented with different weekly spreads. I use dailies as well they are essential for me! but need a week overview. I also havent wanted to take more than  pages. English isnt my native language as well as language of my bullet journal but I decided to do one of these in English so you can see how I do them and it could inspire someone.Ive tried plenty layouts starting with one week on two pages  dailies but there was too much space left. I then started to shrink the boxes and completely changed it to this nonlinear design. This way is everything on the perfect place and Ive been using this layout for few weeks except some design changes when Im bored. In the top left corner there are ToDos for the whole week. It is fairly important so its up there so I see it immediately after opening. Next to this is Monday and Tuesday. The rest of the days frame the page. In the middle there is mini calendar to highlight which week is and little box for blog tasks. Underneath is drawn little note. It serves as a place for my boyfriend to write me something nice. It could be definitely changed to anything else. Under the note there is my water or tea or anything healthier than Coke intake tracker. Ive used to write it on dailies but I got bored and annoyed as it took too long. Also If I had it in monthly tracker I would forget about it.Next to this is box for next week. It is not closed down because I dont know how much space Ill need for it. Sometimes its long to cover it all sometimes its short. Then I can draw a little gratitude log or anything else under. Since there are things for next week I dont have to see them very well and its perfectly good for me to have them on the inner side.,bulletjournal,dgnlbp4,1,t5_33po3
