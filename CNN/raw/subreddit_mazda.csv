114676,0,t1_cerfqwt,Great advice. I had a  s hatchback and it was about  years old when it got run over by some idiot in a jackedup monster truck. The truck was big enough that the bottom of its bumper didnt touch the top of my bumper. To make matters worse it was a hit and run. Anyway the truck did a huge amount of damage. One rear quarter panel the hatch bumper and some suspension parts all had to be replaced. It was about k in damage. I also found out the hard way about the rental car as they had to order the new hatch and assembly from Japan and it took a really long time to show up. At least I had a Mazda  as a rental though. My car was similar to yours. While the shop did a great job it just never was the same. There were mysterious squeaks and rattles in the back and some of the parts never had the same fit as from the factory.  ,mazda,cerhlpj,2,t5_2qhca

The heater system warms air using the heat from the engine itself thus why it takes a few minutes of running the car before the air gets warm. The AC runs on a different belt driven system that takes power from the drive train and creates a pressure differential that cools air.

3147203,0,t3_2w3t9x,my best guess is that the aux input on the back of the head unit is bring used by a satellite receiver. You should still be able to use the navigation without the satellite because I believe theyre two different inputs.You will need either the switching box or you will need to disconnect the satellite radio from the head unit. Find a local car audio place to help you if you dont feel comfortable doing this on your own. If youre using the aux input that I think you are .mm to .mm your steering wheel controls will not function. The iPod input only works if you have a USB connection either on the back of the radio or in the center console. Otherwise youre not going to have steering wheel functionality. In regards to the backup camera there shouldnt be any reason for it not to function. Again the satellite input fmam and CD are all separate inputs. The backup camera will be separate as well and should not use an aux input. ,mazda,coo7d3l,2,t5_2qhca

4013242,0,t3_36g8vp,None of this matters to the year or model you are thinking about but it is about the Manual or Auto question. Have you drove a manual before? I learned on my   and Im having a blast. The person before me learned on it too as my syncros for th and reverse are hit or miss. Im at k now and got it at k.When I drove an auto I always felt in a rush especially in traffic. Once I started driving my  speed in traffic my attitude changed and traffic isnt death after work for me.  Today a dude got on the highway going  and promptly got out of the merge lane. Right before he got over I dropped it to nd and flew by him without road rage as that was my spirited drive for the day or week. I have a .L and a whole  hp but a manual makes use of that  hp as its rated at near  rpm which is useless for an auto as it shifts before then unless you WOT the whole time.I have to say that I enjoy driving a manual except when Im hungry and need to eat while driving.

5056420,0,t1_cuvfe06,Yea I was quite upset as it was my favorite car so far. My dad bought it brand new in September . It was a  LX. My mom drove it for years and it was always very well maintained. Then in  I bought it off of them and I rebuilt the suspension replaced all the motor mounts did the timing beltwater pump replaced the AC compressor the headlights and did services like clockwork. I also installed what I thought to be a pretty killer sound system. Basically everything but a subwoofer because I needed the trunk space. I had a lifetime alignment done at Firestone so every  months and when I worked on the suspension I took it back for an alignment. That car tracked perfectly. I had that car dialed in so perfect that you could literally drive for miles without touching the steering wheel on a road that wasnt crowned. But on the bright side I get to drive a Dodge Dart until things get figured out. Not anything near as cool as a Mazda  but its way better than the Chevy they wanted to give me.,mazda,cuvhmyf,1,t5_2qhca

They are an independent company and can choose to operate how they want. This doesnt mean they cant get in trouble from Mazda if you you raise a fuss but many a dealership will turn you away for any number of reasons.Id actually call and ask to speak to the head managerowner of the dealership and respectfully voice your displeasure with the way you were treated. Mazda will have some ability to reprimand the dealership but in reality the dealership will see little negativity from it.This happens all the time in all types of establishments. It isnt right but it is legal for any company to choose to serve someone and not others. Its unfortunate but any company can choose to not serve someone as long as it isnt for specific protected rights  but if they dont mention a reason then there is little recourse other than complaining to someone who values their public image.Edit I assumed you were in the US.

The car before that was a mazda and its battery did start to die after inactivity for more than a few days. I then spent a lot of time with my mechanic discussing issues with the car including if battery draining was because of driving frequency. No it wasnt  there was a serious electrical wiring problem.Honestly you should be able to leave your car driven for  months. It is not the best idea to do so but it should be doable.  days is ridiculous.Id call mazda themselves not the dealership and ask them how often they think the car should be driven so the battery dont drain WITHOUT telling them you have the problem.

8144943,0,t3_4qt1en,You dont buy all those parts unless you plan on hardparking or actually driving the car as fast as you can.  I lean towards the former as he doesnt mention what kind of tires are on the car probably the best performance upgrade you can do is quality tires.If the price is right and you like the test drive then go for it. I have a hunch that those suspension parts will make it ride less comfortable than stock and his detailed list makes the car more expensive than one that is more stock and has lower miles.  When changing parts from oe you create the potential for problems ie the control arms could wear out and clunk springs could sag and the wiring could be shoddy on the upgrades creating unforeseen problems and draining the battery.Test drives are free you can always walk away. If everything looks like it was well put together you like driving it and you think its worth the money then buy it end of story.  However I bet you can find cars that are cheaper and closer to stock which will be better suited for you as you reduce the risk of unforeseen problems.  This is a car for someone who was going to buy all those parts anyway.Edit well maintained a protege seems to be solid through k barring rust problems.  You will likely be replacing parts on it once or twice a year nothing major though it sounds like you would need to go to a mechanic which will run you a few hundred bucks each time.  Engine should be solid through k no problem same engine as the miata but you might be replacing other suspension and drivetrain components to get there the transmission is probably the biggest cost item aside from ac.Given your situation try and find something closer to k miles if you can.,mazda,d4vnwza,3,t5_2qhca

11463719,0,t3_63mvht,Pumping is just getting rid of whats stored in the vacuum assist usually. If theres no air in the lines which shouldnt change with just a pad change and you havent gotten the brakes hot enough to boil the fluid then its going to be a pad compound thats changed your brake characteristics.Bottom line is people are stupid now let me explain why. People have no idea how good or bad their brakes are and take whats called initial bite as a sign of how good their brakes are. This is bad and wrong but people say hey look how good my brakes are theyre super touchy with poor modulation...  Anyway beside master cylinder vs caliper piston size your braking characteristics are dictated by pad. People like low noise low dust which is bad for performance characteristics. If you dont like the pads get a more agressive compound but youll have to live with the consequences of more dust and noise,mazda,dfvelxi,1,t5_2qhca
