It stopped moving before I could get it out of there. I put it out in the sun. I didnt have to give it CPR but I did have to check if it was alive. It just started writhing with its beak wide open. I flipped it over off its back and this seemed to help. Took about an hour but it stood up and ran around all crazy like. It took off shortly after.

Imagine your pet living his or her final few hours in a strange vet office around many other peoplepets they dont recognize. Theyre probably going to be uncomfortable. Most pets seem to hate the vets office.We had a vet euthanize our dog of  years at our home. She was calm she was around everyone she loved in a familiar environment and on her favorite spot on the couch. Which kind of left us a bad memory of that couch and no one really wants to sit on it anymore because it reminds us of her but we wanted her to be as comfortable as possible. So if youre considering euthanizing your pet see if you can find a vet who will do it at home. Its so much better in my opinion.,HumansBeingBros,d3mm49w,1,t5_2xh58

8674571,0,t1_d6pjyta,gt It isnt that I dont believe that suicidal people should be helped or stopped but at the same time I dont understand why we prevent people from killing themselves. There are things that are much worse than death and for some the pain and misery of living is too much to bear. I would rather someone end their life then to continue suffering.gt Because in reality it doesnt get better. Most often it gets worse.There are undoubtedly people who mindfully commit suicide but the vast majority do it impulsively and even the slightest barrier can prevent them from doing so. This is why we stop jumpers.Consider the British coalgas storygtFor generations the people of Britain heated their homes and fueled their stoves with coal gas. While plentiful and cheap coalderived gas could also be deadly in its unburned form it released very high levels of carbon monoxide and an open valve or a leak in a closed space could induce asphyxiation in a matter of minutes. This extreme toxicity also made it a preferred method of suicide. Sticking ones head in the oven became so common in Britain that by the late s it accounted for some  suicides a year almost half the nations total.gtThose numbers began dropping over the next decade as the British government embarked on a program to phase out coal gas in favor of the much cleaner natural gas. By the early s the amount of carbon monoxide running through domestic gas lines had been reduced to nearly zero. During those same years Britains national suicide rate dropped by nearly a third and it has remained close to that reduced level ever since.gtHow can this be? After all if the impulse to suicide is primarily rooted in mental illness and that illness goes untreated how does merely closing off one means of selfdestruction have any lasting effect? At least a partial answer is that many of those Britons who asphyxiated themselves did so impulsively. In a moment of deep despair or rage or sadness they turned to what was easy and quick and deadly  the execution chamber in everyones kitchen as one psychologist described it  and that instrument allowed little time for second thoughts. Remove it and the process slowed down it allowed time for the dark passion to pass.Or the Duke Ellington Bridge storygtIn Northwest Washington stands a pretty neoclassicalstyle bridge named for one of the citys most famous native sons Duke Ellington. Running perpendicular to the Ellington a stones throw away is another bridge the Taft. Both span Rock Creek and even though they have virtually identical drops into the gorge below  about  feet  it is the Ellington that has always been notorious as Washingtons suicide bridge. By the s the four people who on average leapt from its stone balustrades each year accounted for half of all jumping suicides in the nations capital. The adjacent Taft by contrast averaged less than two.gtAfter three people leapt from the Ellington in a single day period in  a consortium of civic groups lobbied for a suicide barrier to be erected on the span. Opponents to the plan which included the National Trust for Historic Preservation countered with the same argument that is made whenever a suicide barrier on a bridge or landmark building is proposed that such barriers dont really work that those intent on killing themselves will merely go elsewhere. In the Ellingtons case opponents had the added ammunition of pointing to the equally lethal Taft standing just yards away if a barrier were placed on the Ellington it was not at all hard to see exactly where thwarted jumpers would head.gtExcept the opponents were wrong. A study conducted five years after the Ellington barrier went up showed that while suicides at the Ellington were eliminated completely the rate at the Taft barely changed inching up from . to  deaths per year. Whats more over the same fiveyear span the total number of jumping suicides in Washington had decreased by  percent or the precise percentage the Ellington once accounted for.gtWhat makes looking at jumping suicides potentially instructive is that it is a method associated with a very high degree of impulsivity and its victims often display few of the classic warning signs associated with suicidal behavior. In fact jumpers have a lower history of prior suicide attempts diagnosed mental illness with the exception of schizophrenia or drug and alcohol abuse than is found among those who die by less lethal methods like taking pills or poison. Instead many who choose this method seem to be drawn by a set of environmental cues that together offer three crucial ingredients ease speed and the certainty of death.,HumansBeingBros,d6pxzo9,6,t5_2xh58

9927513,0,t1_db08oja,gt if they love their animals why wouldnt they refrain from putting them in agony?gt virtually every farmer will castrate hisher cows and pigs without anaesthetic and put them through a lot of pain.gt when an animal is used as a commodity for humans the wellbeing of the animal is usually neglected in many ways.You sound like you are speaking from a specific morality or idealized perspective and from witnessing the worst farming conditions. Thats ok because we all have our own experiences that dictate perspective. That being said I invite you to consider something you may have not seen or been exposed to.I grew up on a farm among many farms amp ranches in the area. I witnessed a lot of styles of ranching and farming but none of them could be considered factory farming. Our circle of farmers believe animals factory farming was inherently animal mistreatment. Any employee directly mistreating animals was not tolerated and they were either corrected or fired.We grew up to learn that people plants animals soil and water are all integral to survival. We are all equals in importance even though we each have different roles. If we mistreated one piece it rippled into other parts including ourselves. The wellbeing of everything was always a consideration but we werent going to babyproof everything sugar coat things or minimize pain. The root of it is business so loving and caring for stock animals is all about costs and benefits. Not using anesthetics is more than just a cost issue but cost is the biggest piece because the market does not support it and that shit is not cheap. If we used anesthetics the needle causes pain and there is an increased chance of causing infection at the injection site because we cannot sterilize the needles or the skin in between injections. It takes time to inject and allow the meds to kick in. So the more animals you have the less practical it is to use anesthetics. Besides the pain from castration only lasts a couple hours to a few days depending on the method. You can see that it is quite minor from their behavior before and after. I mention this because none of them are in agony as you dramatically put it. If you want to see agony watch an animal give birth when they broke a major bone or when one fell and a stick jammed into its eyesocketOn the farm we learned that pain is just a fact of life that cannot be avoided. Pain is an integral part of life. Some pain now might prevent other pain later and some comfort now might lead to other pain later. Some pain fostered or inspired growth. Some pain begat new life. Some pain spurred death. Castration improves farm life and sustains the dynamic within the farmers limited resources. It was a small cost with a huge benefit.If you personally want to minimize pain relating to farm animals I suggest you not worry so much about using or not using anesthetics. Encourage people to eat meat from farms that raise animals in a more environmentally harmonious way. Do not support businesses that use meat from factory farms.tldr Anesthetic juice is expensive. Most farmers do not tolerate mistreatment of animals or land. Castration pain is quite minor and not even close to agony. Castration prevents a lot of other problems that could lead to a farmers demise or poor farm conditions. Pain in life is unavoidable. If you really give a shit about food animals eat meat from good sources to support the right way to raise animals.,HumansBeingBros,db1kw5s,1,t5_2xh58

Its me and one other guy and I get out at about  and he wins.  The auctioneer then asks which boat he wants he says the white one and the auctioneer says to me OK you get the blue one.  Huh?  Turns out the announced terms was high bidder gets first choice second bidder gets the other boat.  Never heard of that before.  So I take a walk around the blue one and the entire transom or whatever you call the back of the pontoons on a hobie cat is gone.  Both sides.  So fuck me.  Im in line paying for the boat and I see the guy that bought the white one.  I tell him Dude as soon as Im done paying for this boat if you want it its yours.  It had decent sails a trailer and rigging.  I figured it was a good parts boat for him and I wasnt going to compound a  mistake by throwing a  at it.

On principle strong painkillers are even in hard cases not given. According to Mother Teresas bizarre philosophy it is the most beautiful gift for a person that he can participate in the sufferings of Christ. Dr Robin Fox was astounded in  that they werent being used in her hospice in Calcutta and noted that her philosophy in this regard seemed to differ from that of the hospice movement. There is some anecdotal evidence from Catholic medical volunteers in the orders hospitals and hospices in India that pain medication was not routinely administered. Theres more her charities would stop accepting donations because they couldnt spend it all surely they could have bought plenty of pain drugs with some of it.

Just didnt want to see a valid point being downvoted for nothingThank you reddit for turning that around. There should be an important distinction when referring to hacking. Using it incorrectly can lead to paranoia and fear of   HaxorzEDIT For those claiming this could still be hacking yes possibly. We dont know the exact means in which they operated.

11187004,0,t3_5zk1ae,I think one of the biggest drawbacks of American society is we underestimate workers that are at places like McDonalds. They are typically viewed as incapable people  just burger flippers.Ill never forget what changed my mind about this. I was visiting my then in laws in Europe. It was slow at the McDonalds we stopped at and the cashier got pretty excited to practice the English he learned in school for years with a real American his words. I had a nice conservation with the guy.Later that day I was relaying the conversation to my sister in law. I told her how I couldnt get over how professional the worker was there. She looked at me and said Why wouldnt he be professional? Thats his career.That one statement by her had a profound affect on the way I viewed workers in lower skilled jobs. Not everyone can be brain surgeons. Society needs workers of all skill sets. If someone has a job and is out there working for themselves or their family their employment should be recognized with a living wage and respect for being out there working.This story just kind of just struck a nerve and brought up for me internally how we often dismiss what workers like this contribute to our society and minimize what they are capable of because we are conditioned at a societal level to see people like this as like than.,HumansBeingBros,df01836,2,t5_2xh58

11689384,0,t1_dgkyfxy,gtTechnology is spinning the world out of control.You could say that about just about anything.
