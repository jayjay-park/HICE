6492902,0,t3_434vah,I would say the mega jump from Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus. Its a bit hard to explain but Ill try.Essentially the game keeps track of the last location that Sly touched the ground just in case you fall off a ledge or into water so it knows where to put you. The same bit of code that triggers remember this location also triggers the little puff of dust that appears at Slys feet when he touches the ground. Jumping then swinging the cane before hitting the ground and immediately jumping will cause this dust to not appear the animation for swinging has to finish before the game is allowed to remember where you touched the ground but you can jump before the animation finishes canceling out this remembrance so if you travel a large distance while repeatedly jumping and swinging and then jump into water or off a ledge that would harm you you will be launched back to the last place that the dust appeared.Useful for speedruns Sly will go straight through level architecture which can cause him to hit the trigger hidden inside the cannon in Raleighs place skipping the three levels in that half of his hideout for example as well as some Master Thief Sprints launching yourself forward in the level skipping some climbing etc..,Slycooper,czqwxl3,2,t5_2t8v6

9148976,0,t3_55jdaw,Ive gotta say it really seems like youre selling this game short in pretty much every area and Im not just saying that because this one is my favorite in the series.You spent a large portion of the video tackling why you find the story to be lackluster. You say that the multiple characters being added detract focus from the main storyline when that couldnt be farther from the truth. Every chapter advances one of the three main characters struggles in some way. Venice is obviously a Murray chapter because we see him go from being unsure of every action and feeling that he failed Bentley to seemingly going back to the big and brawny tough guy. There is also a mission where Sly saves Carmelita from a gang with some dialogue that jokes about how he has a thing for her. I said seemingly because the next chapter in the Outback furthers Murrays story where we see just how unsure hes become. A seemingly throwaway line in the first chapter about Murray being trained by a Guru is now brought back to show that Murray feels that he betrayed his training. After getting permission to leave with his gang the Guru even agrees to come with them starting his arc about befriending others and no longer being so secluded such as when he jokes with Bentley or saves Sly or gets the Panda King to join. This culminates in him accepting new pupils in the end which admittedly doesnt turn out well. There is also another Carmelita moment where Sly stays to make sure she is okay by watching her all night. Holland starts Bentleys arc officially. He has the most stake in this particular chapter as he wants to add Penelope as a member and a girlfriend. We also see that Penelope is not playable. She hides behind her RC equipment similar to how Bentley hid behind tech in the second game setting up an arc just like Bentleys to continue throughout this game. We see in the ending cutscene that Penelope falls for Sly sparking the first of many divisions throughout this game that make Bentley doubt Sly. China is one of my favorite chapters. Every character gets an advancement on their arc. Sly and the Panda King must come to terms with being on the same side as well as reconciling with both of their pasts. Bentley displays more jealousy for Sly and also gets outsmarted by Tsao multiple times at one point forcing Sly to have to take over the planning phase leaving him at his lowest. Murray gets his van back and as a result gets almost all of his own confidence back but that same confidence leads to the plan going awry which makes Murray feel worse. Guru has two of his greatest shining moments and is the catalyst for Panda King even agreeing to join in the first place. And Penelope gets out in the field more and as a result gets almost killed. Then in Blood Bath Bay we finally get to see Bentley and Penelope talk through their problems culminating in both of them saving each other Bentley getting the girl of his dreams and Penelope coming out of her shell. Completing Penelopes arc and a part of Bentleys. Panda King fights alongside Sly without any thought completing his arc wonderfully. Dimitri whos arc was building throughout the game is given a reason to care. He had something very important taken from him and Sly helped him get it back leading to a strong bond between former enemies and a Dimitri who now actually has people to care about. Guru almost died to help out the gang an action that he would never even consider before completing his arc though there is still another example of him doing a dangerous mission in the last chapter. If youll notice a pattern here its that all of the four added characters arcs are completed in this penultimate chapter allowing the three main characters to finish their arcs up in the finale but there is still a bit more set up here. Murray has one last blow when he thinks he led Sly to his death when its assumed he has blown up and Sly has a moment of sadness that Carmelita didnt show up.When we open up on the final chapter we see what the game has been subtly building up the whole time in that Sly is both worried about how he may not stack up to his ancestors as well as whether its the right thing to do to pursue love with Carmelita. Obviously these two things cant happen together so it is a tough choice. The Dr M parallel to Bentley that you claimed appeared out of nowhere was just revealed at the proper moment to make the player start to notice all of the subtle things that the game had showed of Bentley. The Dr M parallel was always there but we could only see it once Ms past affiliation was revealed. And Murray...holy shit Murray. After every blow to his selfesteem that hes suffered the van Bentleys paralysis breaking his training putting the whole team in harms way thinking he killed Sly and in a time where Bentley is questioning why he follows Sly and Sly is debating between two paths for the rest of his life Murray has to be the strong one. Not physically like in the past but emotionally. Murrays speech followed by his toughest fight yet is the turning point in the game for all three main characters. It shows that this game is about their bond and Murray is holding it together and so Bentley is snapped out of his doubting and finds that most of it comes from his insecurities over his paralysis. Two arcs completed beautifully. But there is still one left.Sly and Carmelita finally finish an arc that has been building really over all three games. That moment where Sly is in his vault seeing all of the treasure of his family so close to making his mark and yet he still gives it away to be with Carmelita is so beautiful. And Carmelita putting her job on the line to accept Sly as a partner is just as much. Its also a bit sad as this family we just fully realized is now being broken up. Boom.  character arcs set up and completed. None of which overtake the main three arcs nor the main idea of the game being family. Dr M is also a far more interesting villain than Neyla. We dont know why Neyla betrayed everyone or where she came from but we know exactly who Dr M is and it is a background that ties him to all three main characters in the game something that no Sly villain before or since has done.Now the gameplay for the most part is a matter of opinion but I do actually like all of the styles. I also want to critique three of your points on the gameplay. One there is in fact a very great balance in gameplay as Sly is still the majority with Bentley and Murray at a close second. The other four get very few missions in comparison. Two Penelopes grappling hook is used in enough situations where it is shown to be very necessary such as when she pulls Murrays van from the water or when she clears the way for Sly on a ledge. She also has a car which Bentley doesnt have. And three this game did not have any more mini games than Sly  had and I think that Sly  actually had more. However your point about the clue bottles is very valid. A disappointment for sure. This game has a huge legup on Sly  in terms of story because of its subtlety. In Sly  all development was very inyourface. Bentley talks about being scared all the time so that will change. Neyla betrays the gang so obviously she will be the big bad. That story wasnt bad but it didnt seem as subtletywoven as this one. Each arc would not be noticed unless you really look at every scene as if they are chapters in a book as evidenced by your review. It shows a real maturity in writing.,Slycooper,d8bp6jo,2,t5_2t8v6

10759082,0,t1_ddpn2a1,Sly  is good dont get me wrong it just wasnt Sly Cooper tho But I did love it Im not going to lie I was so happy to see Samzaru or whatever their name is release sly  I was waiting so long for that game to release and when I got it I played it all the way through. I mean the graphics are stunning the game ran smooth and it had a cool story but it wasnt Sly Cooper. I hope when they make Sly  they try to go with the old school Sly Cooper and tell us Sly  was a spin off. But Sly  was a good game none the less I did enjoy it.,Slycooper,ddppxc8,2,t5_2t8v6
