26989,0,t1_ceh9t9u,Yeah I also think the s are rather distinctive for their long layered cuts and naturallooking hair dyes with lowlights and highlight.,BeautyDiagrams,cehi6vp,1,t5_2upx6

431008,0,t3_1z0iir,My bf got me this palette for Christmas and even though I love and play with it often I have a hard time doing looks that flatter my eyeshape. As you and I have the same shape your tutorials are always helpful. The way you elongate the eye is fascinating. I love that you plan on doing more tutorials with the Naked ! Thank you.,BeautyDiagrams,cfpft7c,5,t5_2upx6

1260300,0,t1_cibatae,The reason being is warm or hot water opens up the cuticle of your hair letting some of your color out. Cold water closes your cuticle keeping your color locked in longer. ,BeautyDiagrams,cibedtm,4,t5_2upx6

3504501,0,t1_cpri2ia,Whenever I see tutorials like this I think to myself wow these are gorgeous I wish I could pull these off but they just wont work with my fine hair. My whole hair braided isnt even an inch thick and just gets frizzy I figure thick hair would create the look better but maybe not?,BeautyDiagrams,cprqkqm,7,t5_2upx6

4945777,0,t1_cuhxe01,Oh I just let my hair air dry. Ill throw some mousse in it and hope for the best. Ive got a layered textured cut and somewhat wavy hair so most of the time this works well. Wash condition comb? Super quick. Blow drying? Well thats like  minutes just to get it mostly dry not even finishedstyled.  If I have to try and style thats at least a full hour of time. ,BeautyDiagrams,cuhye7z,1,t5_2upx6
