5811550,0,t3_3urpr8,Salaam For me its due to weight.Im underweight and shed pounds way too easily.  I want to gain enough to get back into the healthy zone. I cant seem to find a lot of high calorie affordable vegan or vegetarian foodsmeals other then avocados and peanut butter. And last time I tried to go vegetarian I lost too much.  Milk and meat are stationary gaining foods.  I just buy halal brands that Ive heard are reputable. ,EatingHalal,cxhh7nf,1,t5_2xkel
