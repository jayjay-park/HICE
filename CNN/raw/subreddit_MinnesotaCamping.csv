659449,0,t3_21p09z,My favorite site is on the split rock loop. It is the one that is on the north side of the river and you are literally right next to the river. Basically it is on the beach and pretty secluded for such a popular section of the trail. Also Lake Agnus is a good one. ,MinnesotaCamping,cgf898k,3,t5_2weqm

There are usually only  permits issued per day at each entry point this is variable and the popular entry points fill up quick on certain dates.  You fill out the online form and make the payment and then you will have your reservation.  You pick up the permit at the ranger station of outfitter prior to entry.  You can change the pick up location and number of people in your party after you make the initial purchase.  ,MinnesotaCamping,co3usp6,1,t5_2weqm

9022949,0,t1_d7w84ev,Thats what everyone was saying! Even people at the campsite mentioned that this is the busiest it had been on the whole trail. Youre right people are starting to flock to it as the northernmost section is extremely beautiful.Our favorite campsite was probably South Carlson Pond. It had a lot of room plenty of bench space big fire pit and it was a very short walk down to the lake to enjoy the view.I would avoid Woodland Caribou as it had a very long walk between camp and water source compared to other sites. It was my favorite latrine on the trail though so it has that going for it!The northernmost camp at Andy Creek was tiny. There was really only room for two twoperson tents and the latrine was  feet from the firepit. Plus the water in the creek wasnt flowing very well Im always paranoid about water filtering.People must love going out for the fall colors. We pretty much caught it at the end of summer and it was a fantastic time to go. Cheers!,MinnesotaCamping,d7wf15u,2,t5_2weqm
