It is well worth it though for the double procs.Think about this up until the boss you should be able to do damage and survive using the occasional meteor and normal photons.  When you get to the boss in difficult events if your party is smart you will be staggering your unisons.  You can use meteor and let it reload during the unison and be ready to fire it if again.  Meteor is very effective when used in this fashion.,UnisonLeague,cx3nssg,1,t5_3873c

Id say about k is pretty good if youre level .. im not sure exactly how to compare but if you measure it against other lvl s and you appear on the upwards of the average youre set. At least thats how i do it.Save cost until you get urable gear. That way you wont be worried about not having the cost to fill it. I always have around  but thats because i dont get lots of gear and kinda go with what i get in order to boost it properly.

6481700,0,t3_44ewar,Santa Lilith is actually really good as her ability is I believe on par or slightly below par with the actual UR Lilith monster so I would definitely keep her and yes use her if you need debuffs as she is the debuff queen. And I would honestly replace the flora with the nemain. The reason for this being is that physoth boosts two stats that are worthwhile for Mage Fenrir boosts both defenses which is good but flora only boosts one stat that a Mage needs and thats matk. Plus the ability that nemain gives far out ways the loss of the approximately k gs that you would lose. Thats just my two cents though and are of course free to make your own decisions and take advice from other sources.

6607993,0,t1_d02rwxj,Yup I completely agree with you. Im a mage and even though I dont carry haste I bring Valk Shina Marduk Ama Nyx and Nezha all useful monsters in PvE. Imo the stat loss from taking out one of these monsters including their buff unison is not worth running a  cost monster that only really serves its purpose when exactly  or  others use haste. I would still run haste if I had Fiine but I used all my gems last favorite spawn and didnt get her. I rarely run into games where theres all mages but even then there are many games where there is no haste because some other class namely soldierlancerarcher decides to run flora or some other useless monster and use that as their excuse for not carrying haste. I do think that mages that dont use up all their monster cost or have no useful buff monsters should carry haste.,UnisonLeague,d02tm5r,2,t5_3873c

8139804,0,t3_4qpw04,Id need to know a bit more information like what level are you and how much cost you put into things to really give an accurate read. Im assuming you just switched from soldier? Cost at the moment is alright but youre gonna want to put way more in monsters and work towards getting better monsters. Also any equipment thats in the main slot will proc more often than the other slots so you want to move your UR armor to the first slot and at the current moment any Phys Testament XLs until you get sufficient enough lancer attacks to where the skill procs would matter.If you havent already done so work on your lancer class ring. Youre definitely going to want to switch out your soldier attacks for lancer attacks and be sure to grab the utmost bottom skill from the lancer ring. Those passives are global so theyll apply to all of your classes.Also when you switch to lancer be sure to prioritize lances for your weapons because they get passive buffs. If you go back to soldier your swords and axes will get passive buffs instead. For now work on getting Apollo gear and Apollo. His gear and weapon when placed in your MAIN slot and URed gives a  attack increase which is constant. Its called Sun Incarnates Blessing. ,UnisonLeague,d4v0rv7,1,t5_3873c

10006609,0,t3_5iy66x,Ateam customer support is a dumpster fire full of formreplies. The only people who have ever been helpful to me or anyone else experiencing a bug that seems to only impact one or few people are the admins. When a friend of mine who hadnt played the game for days logged in during RGB to find herself in a completely different guild that she herself didnt join nor could have possibly joined because she wasnt playing the game when it happened none of the messages that she or her guild leader sent to customer support ever got a response until I shit you not two weeks after RGB was over. And even then the response boiled down to it was probably yr fault so too bad.It was only because I posted here and on the official forum and someone flagged down uAteamAdmin that we got a timely response at all. AteamAdmin is a gem and treasure. The issue was not ultimately fixed and my friend got skunked out of that RGB and has since pretty much quit the game entirely but AteamAdmin actually gave a shit and worked to help us get some answers. All the admins are swamped and it might be hard to get a hold of someone but tbh thats your best bet.Also if you do post to the official forum be prepared for about seventeen you probably transmuted her away and forgot about it replies. Theyre helpful like that.,UnisonLeague,dbbw1oo,2,t5_3873c

10117400,0,t1_dbq6o0t,I didnt play healer this colo but from what I observed its OK for the healer to uni in the second round if they know they can reliably get uni back up for round  in the course of healing the team throughout the round. They just need to signal to the other team not to follow them I had a couple healers that used uni in round  with no X signaling and then flipped shit on the people who joined them thinking that was what they were supposed to do. DPSers cannot depend on unibuilding the way a healer can. There is a limited amount of living target health for a DPSer to deplete before the round is over but an unlimited amount of living target health for a healer to heal so long as they have the cost to do it. Cost willing you will get uni back in time for round  no problem.None of this factors in the additional uni that you build from taking hits since thats totally random and you cant depend on it as a reliable source of unibuilding.,UnisonLeague,dbqazne,1,t5_3873c

Of course your throwing yourself to RNG but with the chance of actually surviving.
