Ive been working on a nature series lately that I plan on producing in print form and Im really proud of it. I havent been proud of anything Ive produced in a long time so I hope it brings a little bit of happiness to your day. In the end thats all I want. I want people to look at my work and feel happy because of it. When I see a nature or wildlife shot that resonates in me the feeling is really amazing and I want to provide that for others.Seriously  thank you to so many of you who uplifted me over a year ago and supported me when I was just beginning to feel like Hey I think I can do this!

2581887,0,t3_2pd9nu,You should watch rewatch Lost.     If you havent seen it  its incredible. If you have seen it  its always a great show to rewatch because theres so much going on and so many little easter eggs I can guarantee youll see something new that youve never noticed before      I was a huge huge JJ Abrams fan when this show came out Felicity iswas one of my favorite shows of all time. I loved Alias I was SO stoked to watch the show. So I watched the first maybe  or  episodes as Lost first aired and I was SO frustrated. Theres so many questions so many unanswered plotlines. I was furious and from then on REFUSED to ever watch Lost again. It only made me more angry as the show became more and more popular.    Fast forward to like  years later when I met my boyfriend and he finally convinced me to watch it again because its his favorite show. It wasnt on Netflix at the time so we had to actually go to a blockbuster what? I know. and RENT the DVDs! LOL. So we were able to marathon pretty much the entire show and I loved it. LOVE LOVE LOVE.     I cried during SO many episodes oh man. Theres characters you HATE and then you end up LOVING! And a few people that you love at the beginning and then you wish they were dead. Ugh the dramatics are so so good.     You should totally watch it. I kinda hope youve never seen it so you can fall in love with it for the first time.  lt    And just for fun with any good show you should IMMEDIATELY feel like this Just one more episode....    P.S. OMGGGG if you havent watched Battlestar Galactica.... OMG.,Wishlist,cmvl8yc,1,t5_2qpbu

2694466,0,t3_2qwvac,Happy New Years Eve people! I guess now would be a good time to reflect on . The first half of this year was especially great. I met with some incredible Redditors in London for a weekend in February and unfortunately for them I have now claimed them as friends for life. Far too many people to tag in one post I might summon them when Ive finished depending on how lazy I amThen just after that weekend I passed my driving test. I had been learning to drive on and off since I was  so for three years and it took me five attempts to pass the test but I feel like its given me so much more freedom and has completely changed my life. Im so proud of myself for sticking with it as I was so close to giving up multiple times.Then later in the year I graduated from university. I did much better than I was expecting to do and just yeah Im proud of myself for that! Just after I graduated I turned  then celebrated by traveling up to Edinburgh in a glorified coffin disguised as a Luxury Coach with ushawnusaurus to meet the previously mentioned Redditors who took us to see some strange ukulele players a penguin parade and got me this incredible birthday cake And as someone put it it was the first time theyd ever seen me speechless! I was just blown away that theyd do something so lovely for me That weekend very securely made up my mind that Im never letting them escape my friendship The second half of the year wasnt so great for a few reasons but Im not going to dwell on them as Ive also had some great stuff happen at the same time such as uiamadudette coming to stay with me for a weekend and us splurging all our money on shoes on the first day of her visit Not even mad! So all in all this has been a pretty good year for me! I think  is going to be my toughest year yet but Im excited to tackle the challenges it throws my way and seeing where I end up this time next year! I hope  is the best year ever for all of you you deserve all the good things! lt ,Wishlist,cnaaagf,8,t5_2qpbu

The ER doc gave me a note to get out of work for  days and some prescriptions. Had to follow up with another doc this morning amp my primary docs office called me back just as they were about to see me. They told me theyll try to push through the referral since its out of system but all I could think was Im about to get boned hard by my insurance.

2820073,0,t1_cnompx9,I assume you sub to SCA? It has taken me a long time to figure out a routine that is working for me but I still suffer from dryness and the occasional cystic acne break out. Like you I tried everything. It is really diacourageing sometimes especially when youre shelling out good money for expensive creams and cleansers. Right now I use cetaphil cleanser and cera ve moisturizer in the morning and cera ve moisturizing cleanser and moisturizer at night. I want to make the switch to the tub but I have heard of it triggering break outs in some and I am more concerned with acne than dryness. I use Vaseline for extra dry spots to compensate. I recently sucked up my pride and went to a dermatologist. Im now on a prescription cream night only and a pill. After two months I can finally see improvement in my cheekbone and chin area. Its very exciting. I was trying witch hazel but I found that it was causing me a lot of redness that I was attributing to something else. I will use it for the occasional really painful pimple though. Sorry to go off on a thing this is just something I am figuring out too. ,Wishlist,cnomvt6,2,t5_2qpbu

Having a perspective that isnt wrought with despair misery and unhappiness will change how to deal with your circumstance. Circumstance can mean everything from nothing wrong to cant pay rent to dying of cancer so perspective is absolutely necessary when determining our disposition and while determining that doing it with a positive attitude and smile will only ever aid you.I should clarify  Sorry guys! My understanding of the message is that happiness is not black and white. There is no shes happy hes sad etc. Happiness is a way of life and although we will forever deal with shitty circumstance every single one of us no matter how fortunate or unfortunate knowing the art of happiness which is a learned art  do not be deceived to think you will naturally have it. Some more than others yes but it is a learned art will help you rebound from the hard times so that your heart and soul dont have prolonged unhappiness.,Wishlist,coh50uo,10,t5_2qpbu

He had an amazing influence on my life and I hope i do him proud. heres us napping together and the farthest away is probably my brother even though he is closest in age and distance we just do not connect. i see him when i have to sometimes we enjoy our time together sometimes it pushes the next time we see each other further out. as for actual distance and family all of my extended family is out of my time zone and do not regularly see any of them on any sort of regular basis. it is usually tragedy that brings us together. but i have a tiny family.  cousins now more sort of since some are married.  aunts.  uncles. and my Grandma and my Nagymama are still alive. then my mom. and my brother and sister. though i married into a massive family that i cannot even comprehend at times. ,Wishlist,cp4lape,3,t5_2qpbu

My memory of the test is that I answered what were apparently a lot of really stupid trivia contests... then I got to go to extra classes where I did cooler stuff than other people I knew.  My childhood memories are... not great.  When I got to high school we had to retake gifted testing to qualify for Governors Honors programs.  Those tests were a lot harder  lots of creative problem solving and showing that youre good with math language and creativity.  Im not sure if I would have gotten in to the programs had I had to start with something like that.  But anyway its fun and it helps keep kids grounded and not bored in their normal classes.  In one of my TAG classes we made our own flavor of soda and had to film commercials about it  ,Wishlist,cpt8dh1,2,t5_2qpbu

I have a neighbor who is transgender and her girlfriend suffers from the most crippling anxiety I have ever witnessed in my life.  It doesnt help that I live in Upstate NY and people can be absolutely horrible.  Anyway I have been trying to befriend them for awhile.  I dont think Ill ever befriend her girlfriend as she is a complete hermit for the most part. But the other night I sat outside with her and just talked for such a long time. She completely opened up to me and I learned so much about her and how much pain she has been through in her life. Friends and family she has lost because of her journey. Anyway shes having an operation on Monday and her preop was Tuesday.  I decided to bring her flowers and wish her luck.  She started crying and kept asking me Why? Why would you do that? and then she told me in the sixty years of her life no one has ever given her flowers. She said I completely made her week and she is just so happy. I started crying.  But just happy tears.  Such a simple act of kindness and it completely made someones day. ,Wishlist,cqlvpze,7,t5_2qpbu

Even if you just use it to buy yourself a coffee and then pay it right off. I dont understand why but not using your credit card can look bad. It doesnt quite make sense to me but whatever.    However closing a credit card that you arent using is usually worse than not using it. So just use it for small purchases and pay them right off and youll be golden.And if you can survive with what you have dont buy yourself a car just yet. Even when you have a closing date still dont do it because they usually do a refresh on your credit report specifically to check for that kind of thing. ,Wishlist,crntn4w,3,t5_2qpbu

There are  seasons now and you can easily knock them out in an afternoon Also my Wife got sucked into everything Dragonball related by watching the original Dragonball with Goku as a little kid.  She found him to be adorable and the original script is a little pg which made it a lot funnier.Besides that I dunno.  You could make your way through the ENTIRE DC animated Universe of shows.

We went to visit him yesterday...made him laugh lots and brought him the Caps hat that we bought for him on Saturday. I really hope this surgery goes smoothly and well for him. It is breaking my hart to see him going through so much. He has been in the hospital for months now.Please send all positive vibes his way. Hes great people.

4722242,0,t3_3flrp2,Monday! I had a really fun weekend. On Saturday I spent much of my day being Japan and at war with everyone. I wanted to play CivV for an hour maybe but that didnt happen. I was late to an internet friend date because of it. We watched Scott Pilgrim which was more awesome than I remembered it. Yesterday I met some friends for cake and Fringe planning. It was fun and a lovely day to walk to and from town. I left much poorer than I arrived though but Im very excited for all of my shows. I also stupidly agreed to an aerial yoga class on Saturday. Sometimes it would be nice if I thought things through before agreeing to them hahaha.  Last night I spent a good deal of time trying to figure out the timing of my NYC trip. I have a lot of people to see and a very limited time to see them. I also want to take a day off people which is complicating things but I think Ill really need it so Im not willing to give it up. I think much of tonight will be spent continuing that. The other night I turned off the TV and my laptop and just sat in silence looking around and reminding myself how wonderfully lucky I am. Most of my possessions books DVDs CDs various other things are mine because a lot of someones thought well enough of me to go out of their way to make my life a little better. I used to feel terribly guilty about it and I still do but when it comes down to it theyre all little symbols of love. And I am an extraordinarily lucky person to have known that amount of love tiredramblings. The first thing I remember saving for is moving to Scotland. I didnt manage to save a lot but I survived and it was all worth it Have a wonderful Monday everyone ,Wishlist,ctps0i2,1,t5_2qpbu

4803012,0,t1_ctzvg2y,So. My previous comment really has to do with all humanity in general. I think that the typical morals we carry go against sustainability and the betterment of future generations. The morals we have today prevent us from progressing. We refuse to let the weak get left behind and put ourselves in danger in the process. To be clear I do NOT support culling the weak our euthenizing people with disabilities. My statement is a bit more passive. If you were in a situation with a friend where you would both certainly die but you could save yourself and I mean only yourself not take their place and let let live most peoples morals tell them to stay. Their instincts tell them to go but morals cloud judgement.,Wishlist,ctzyk1m,2,t5_2qpbu

4920612,0,t1_cuerp9p,In the fifth grade my brother my friend and I went to Oakland Raiders Youth Training Camp. That is what made them my favorite team. Prior to that I wasnt really bothered with favorite teams.The first hockey game I ever watched was Sabres vs. Islanders. The Sabres won in a shoot out and after that I just stuck with em.These next  are kind of ridiculous. I am a Milwaukee Brewer fan because of the movie Major League. I know what you must be thinking. Brock! Major League was about the Cleveland Indians! I know it was. In the movie the Indians announcer was Bob Uecker. His voice was like music to my ears. In real life he is the announcer for the Milwaukee Brewers so that is how I joined the Brew Crew.The Knicks is the strangest one. I have only been watching basketball for a few years. I was flipping through channels when I saw this hair in all its glory. Unfortunaltely after  seasons of being a Knick fan Iman Shumpert shown above was traded to the Cavs. No I did not switch to the Cavs but I do root for them as much as possible.,Wishlist,cues5lf,2,t5_2qpbu

Ive dealt with that for  years now.Lots and lots and lots of ginger is my goto. Take whole raw ginger and grind it upshred it. Soak it in hot water for  minutes add honey and lemon and drink. Drink A LOT of it. I usually do  cups to start holding the hot mug to my uterus. Thats the best athomedonthaveotherstuffprepared remedy I have that Ive found works. Other than that take a Naproxen tablet if you have one and if not take  Advils. I actually have what I call Mexican muscle relaxers from Tijuana thatll put me out for a few hours that work best but Im gonna assume you dont have access to those P The shitty part is if I dont pregame with pain killers and ginger before I suspect I miiiight get cramps Ill get caught off guard and have to go through an hour or two of backbreaking pain playing catchup with the pain killers to try and stop it. ,Wishlist,cva7isf,2,t5_2qpbu

But my favourite parade story is this  We were in Boston for training and at our lunch break my friend Tom tells me to come with him. We go outside to a waiting cab and end up at a side street next to the Pride Parade. Tom then changes on the sidewalk into the Dorothy costume he has made himself complete with size  ruby slippers and walks out and joins the parade. I walk alongside taking photos with his camera while he waves at the crowd and gets cheers. Then we pop out of the parade into another cab and are back at the training session with no one the wiser. Great day. ,Wishlist,cvtkyx5,8,t5_2qpbu

Well this is because I needed to be careful with money as today I just purchased an engagement ring. I was thinking of popping the question on Christmas Eve but decided thats too romantic for me and doesnt suit our relationship. So instead I want to do it on Halloween which is her favourite holiday. Is it a holiday? I dunno whatever. Im trying to come up with creative and memorable ways to do it. I want it to be just us but I think were going out to a party later at night so Ill do it before we go out. Help me!!!!!! Im freakin out.    Side quest New neighbours down the hall. Single mom  big dogs  year old daughter. Kids CONSTANTLY screaming. Like Im afraid for my life kind of screams. Ear piercingly loud and every  minutes from ampm EVERY. FUCKING. DAY. Thought maybe she had disability that made communication difficult such as autism but nope not the case. Seen her in the hall the other day and she was laughing and talking to her mom no problem. I went in my apartment and they were still in the hall. Kid starts screaming bloody murder mom says nothing. How the fuck do I address this issue without offending someone who wont teach her kid its not cool to scream like that ALL the time?    Edit Best idea so far. Suggest we dress up as a zombie bride and groom. Ask her before we go out.,Wishlist,cw45qht,3,t5_2qpbu

6510486,0,t1_czsq7m8,Hmm that might work. One of my favorite easyfast things to make is butter chicken. I sort of tweaked things around until I liked it. Basically  Dice two chicken breasts. Saltpeppercayennecumincurry. Saute a diced onion in about T butter. Add a . oz can of diced tomatoes and let it thicken for a few minutes. I like a little char on the bottom so I dont stir it much. Add spices mostly the ones from step one. Heavy on the curry or garam masala if youve got it. Add a bit of cinnamon cloves and ground coriander too. Taste to make sure your proportions are right. Chuck the chicken in there and put on the lid for  mins or until the chicken is fully cooked. Stir in a bit of milk until the sauce is creamy. You may have to cook it down a bit since the milk wont thicken as quickly as cream would.  Serve over rice ,Wishlist,czsqg0n,1,t5_2qpbu

They told me it would take a couple of weeks to hear back from them. Apparently they really liked my personality and work experiences. I will be helping the Green Office Certification Program on campus help buildings at my uni become sustainably certified! They really liked me. I will have more experience with sustainability jobs. This is an amazing opportunity especially since I currently working on obtaining my Energy and Environmental Design LEED Green Associates certification. Yesterday I was feeling really down because the Carbon Fund on campus rejected me. I had the interview for the Carbon Fund on Friday and I thought it went well. I was really nervous for my interview today. I just gave it my best effort and they really liked me. I cant wait to start working for them this July!,Wishlist,d2rkspe,2,t5_2qpbu

8871363,0,t3_51qmmh,The QOTD has different layers.  Surely my parents have been very important in forming who I am.Similarly my College mentor Dr. Dennis Stevens has been the most influential in how I view America and has formed my patriotism which is a big part of me.  Similarly my military service has changed me for the better and has taught me discipline and the willingness to be part of something bigger than me so my first Commander who i deployed with CPT now COL Aaron Schultz formed me as a soldier.  Also my faith is a big part of me and I would need to credit Pastor Ron in Sioux Falls and Pastor Fred in Omaha with helping form my faith.The most important?  Cliche or not it has to be my wife umakenoapologies who as my soulmate has shown me what love is who has stood by me when I messed up or when my employer messed up by letting me go who has borne me three beautiful children who are mostly awesome who provides companionship lets me make stupid jokes indulges my  football fandom she bought a Packers maternity top during one of the pregnancies and reassures me that ultimately everything will be ok.,Wishlist,d7e7o6g,2,t5_2qpbu

However were not being told exactly what to do and that creates the illusion of freedom more so than the other contests. We are still all in here following orders though trying to come up with the best or most clever reason why this is the best contest.
