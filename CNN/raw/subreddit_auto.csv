255830,0,t3_1x0yyv,I am thinking you have dirty connections on your battery. So enough current can flow to ignition on but when engage the starter to much current and the little bit of contact you get an arc or something interrupts the small contact... well it makes sense in my head and I have seen it a couple times. What I have done in the past is use a battery post cleaner. You can get then anywhere for a couple bucks. walmart any auto storeThe only thing is your blazer should have a bolt style battery connection not a post. although I had this problem on my  chev which should be the same as your blazer.

5331221,0,t3_3nmdvq,Your car as do most modern cars uses unibody construction. That means theres no separate frame the frame is created ...is integral ...as part of the overall body structure. You have some seriously compressed braces and fender mount and no telling what other areas are crushed and out of alignment. Simply welding the pieces back together will not repair this car. If the mounts and substructure are out of alignment youll never get it back together properly. Good chance the car will not track straight either. Professional body shops have special frame straightening racks where they can pull and push things back into proper alignment. This is not a DIY project. ,auto,cvt4g8t,2,t5_2qh1r

7073371,0,t3_4cczbg,Go look up the tires on tirerack or on the manufacturers website. One of the specs that they should provide will be rim width range. That will be the acceptable wheel width range you can use with the tires for example on tirerack I looked up a set of goodyear assurance tires in that size and the acceptable range is . so any  wheel that is . to  wide will be fine to use.As far as offset is concerned ET means that the wheels centerline is mm from the wheel mounting surface in a positive direction see this image for a bit of a visual.   Assuming all other factors being equal comparing wheels of the same width a wheel with less offset will stick out further. For example a the outer edge of a wheel with offset ET would be stick mm further out than your current wheel.
