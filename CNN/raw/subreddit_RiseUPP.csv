8411139,0,t3_4uui4t,Socialism and communism are words we as a party shouldnt out right define ourselves as. Theres a lot of negative connotations to them and the mainstream media will use that to poison our image.,RiseUPP,d5sxq9l,9,t5_3fktc
8413365,0,t1_d5t779b,I know and agree. My point is that functionally in modern time the term has meant more of what were calling Democratic Socialism socially geared policies. I of course dont want to call a new party simply socialist or communist. These systems have proven not to work. I simply mean that people shouldnt fear the connotation of the word today especially as Sanders uses it as part of a larger term.   You could drop the word socialism into a  term phrase and many people would still be terrified. Public health care education etc. are also tenets of socialism. We can draw on it just as we can draw on capitalism and have a system that functions for everyone. ,RiseUPP,d5t7q5n,-3,t5_3fktc
8426896,0,t1_d5una82,A party is all about its ability to be elected in to office.  The Republicans have as much power as they do because they control state and local level elections.  Simply put the liberal portion of the country does not turn out for anything that isnt a national level election.  Even then they only in decent number during Presidential elections.If UPP honestly plans to rise as a party it needs to not target a specific group as an avenue of attack.  All this will do is to alientate a good portion of the country with the exception of the usual Democrat leaning states.  If UPP wants to differentiate itself from that party you dont do it by alienating every state in the nation that isnt usually blue.  If you start out by attacking those who only vote Republican due to Christian beliefs youve already wasted your time and lost the battle.  You might as well vote corporatist Democrat.,RiseUPP,d5uwj9b,6,t5_3fktc
8428726,0,t3_4v27al,While I agree with this gerrymandering is complicated. Look up the CGP Grey video on YouTube. It explains why its a tough issue to tackle way better than I can via a text post. Will link to the video later when Im not on mobile. ltEdit Link to video ,RiseUPP,d5v4rbw,5,t5_3fktc

8458635,0,t1_d5x36sz,Id actually considered this in the past myself. I think the fact that marriage got involved with government at all is a symptom of the wrongful blurring of church and state in the first place. I think theres a lot of minute details to discuss about this and how to best handle it all. Bottom line though I think we all agree that samesex couples and oppositesex couples should be treated the same in any case. ,RiseUPP,d5yv43n,2,t5_3fktc
