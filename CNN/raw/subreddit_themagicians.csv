7042074,0,t1_d19ppeo,Yeah I would have liked to see more timespan even without having read the books yet. Whole show is moving WAAY too fast and it takes away from the enjoyment.Makes me wonder how many few seconds of the extra FTB characters we will actually see in the final  hours of airtime.,themagicians,d1ekr67,1,t5_35a47

7240828,0,t1_d212vbp,As someone who also started on the show and then started reading the books Id have to say that I agree. I feel like the characters are more developed on the show than they were in the books. For one thing Quentin is actually likable on the show whereas for most of the first book I found him to be nearly insufferable. Penny actually has some character development on the show and isnt just a generic autistic kid. Some things are definitely better in the books but I feel like the show took the story and morphed into a much more compelling narrative for television. The book purists dont seem to understand that if the show took the same slow pace as the books nobody would be tuning in past the first couple episodes.,themagicians,d2189oq,5,t5_35a47
7306699,0,t1_d209ixo,Yeah the finale fcked me up too. Was not okay.Took me until now to come back online. I was really pissed at the writers and then the showrunners for not putting warnings before the episode. You dont do sht like that on TV without warning people. There are reasons I dont watch GoT.,themagicians,d28q07c,1,t5_35a47

9550616,0,t1_d9pw8yi,gtBeing true to the books is secondary. It really depends on the show and the people behind it. Some shows tend to get really bad when they go outside of their source material The Walking Dead.,themagicians,d9qb6s5,6,t5_35a47
10132899,0,t3_5kzisa,Quentin can be a super annoying protagonist. The show did not really help in making him any less annoying and it doesnt necessarily let us in as much on the other characters to balance it out.,themagicians,dbsbltd,3,t5_35a47
10142566,0,t1_dbtk2w5,I wouldnt.  The books are a bit different from the tv show.,themagicians,dbtkwvu,3,t5_35a47
10165628,0,t1_dbp5ct8,You dont really seem open to any opinion other than your own. If you honestly expect the same level of storytelling to be honored by a television show with the goal of accruing the most profit possible by being as commercial as possible you are as naive as you are close minded. ,themagicians,dbwbw1d,9,t5_35a47
10175418,0,t1_dbxfmj2,Nice okay. Thank you.  I havent read the books yet but im glad there is some kind of answer. So it is assumed that the time loop starts in different spots depending on where Jane thinks she can make the right swithchange? ,themagicians,dbxfug8,1,t5_35a47

10705855,0,t1_ddk5vpp,She became a Niffin When a Magician loses control over their magic while spellcasting the Magician is consumed by magic and turns into a Niffin a powerful being of pure magical energy. The Magician is then enveloped by a blue fire that takes over their body. Then afterwards you no longer are the same person you can still think but youre detached and for some reason psychopathic and perfectly willing to kill people its like you become pure Id.,themagicians,ddk89ef,10,t5_35a47

Quentin asked the stag to send him home at the end of the first book.The key they used that accidentally sent them back was the one they found on After Island in the nd book.
