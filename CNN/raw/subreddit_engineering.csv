83482,0,t3_1v0jaz, Electrical Engineering specialization in Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence Hardware designprototyping Product designprototypingTypical day is a bit of a vague term since I ended up working for a startup which explains the very large field I put myself in. It typically includes a good amount of interaction with our sales people to provide some help to the sales effort answering specific questions clients may have about our products and to gather information about clients needs. Design code testing and prototyping of new products which is more on the RampD side. Design for manufacture of some of those products includes the actual design phase some more testing parts sourcing QA on parts sometimes assembly then QA of assembled devices.And finally general support for other engineers around the place. We are a relatively small team so everyone pitches in when needed.,engineering,cenxlj6,1,t5_2qhpi

159724,0,t3_1vwhoi,Speaking broadly you would have a very hard time getting hired as an entrylevel structural engineer without a civil degree. Even with a general civil degree it would be tough. Structural firms generally only hire people with degrees in Structural Engineering or Civil with a structural emphasis functionally the same thing. By doing so you will have spent about . years learning design codes and other skills that are absolutely essential to be marketable assuming BS only. A MechE degree just doesnt provide that.That said nothing is impossible. A family friend or personal connection might get your foot in the door. Without that you would be at a severe disadvantage getting that first job. I should note that there are plenty of roles for MechEs in green energy likely more so than structures. I dont know where you are in your education but the curriculum for Civil and Mechanical is exactly the same up to about the rd year.

I asked about stressstrain basic fluid dynamics such as hydrostatic pressure basic stuff in statics distributed loads inclined etc. In wireline the service is logging and since the tools work based on signal processing basic principals are much more rooted in physics. For example acoustics understanding a little bit about rock mechanics understanding the difference between porosity and permeability and how they are measured and differentiated gamma ray emissions and how they are interpreted.

350738,0,t3_1y3awa, Read through the discussed topic prior to class. Nothing too involved just skim get the gist and terminology and write down any questions you have. Dont dwell on something you find confusing just skip it. That will help you follow in class and be lost less often.  Dont write down everything the professor writes down just what you think is important. It is more beneficial to sit listen and think about what he is saying rather than scrambling to keep up with notes. After class read the topic again but more thoroughly this time. Do all the example problems presented in the text and in class. Write down more questions if you have them.  After completing all that you can begin to do your homework. By this time I find myself a lot less frustrated because Ive spent quite a bit of time with the material already. Even at this point write down more questions! At this point go back and try to answer all your questions you should be able to answer at least a few. The remaining ones are perfect for your professors office hours. Other tips  Find a group to do homework with. Discussing among your colleagues is so so so beneficial due to their unique point of views. If you are stuck on a problem skip it! Your brain will unconsciously keep trying to solve it and you might surprise yourself when you look at it again. If its the only onelast one go on a quick short walk and then come back to it. Finally I know this is a lot to digest and is quite demanding but only in the short run. In the long run youll find that after spending so much time with the material youll spend a lot less time studying for finals  ,engineering,cfh4e1c,1,t5_2qhpi

I used simple pitot tubes.The cost issue stems mainly from the fact that most of the components for such a rake are used mainly by the Aerospace and Motorsports sectors which all attract healthy profit margins for suppliers. If you are happy to manufacture things inhouse you can get some really decent gear for not much money.Directionality is something that would be great and if you are willing to do a bit of CAD design could easily get them manufactured using rapid prototypingadditive manufacturing quite cheaply. I looked into it but would need to dedicate  or  channels to each probe which limited the number of probes I could run to ... is an example of timeaveraged data I have recorded behind an open wheel  points of info at kph. The pressure shown is a differential to a common static port on the chassis.I suspect you could easily make some trucksized rigs mine is about mm x mm for reasonably low costs.I sampled at Hz although the sensors could go as high as Hz according to the spec sheet. They suffer a bit from vibration noise but I AV mounted them and reduced the problem to practically nothing. My task for this week is to try and ensembleaverage as opposed to timeavg to see if I can get any useful transient data.I tested the sensors with a pressure calibrator and found them to be accurate to the nearest pascal which for me was more than enough they were  Kpa differential sensors. No idea on their longevity as I have only really used them for a day or so.Qualitatively the system seems to work very well. My pressure tapped wings seemed to show many of the same features that flowviz showed and the rake seems to match CFD quite well.,engineering,cg476lh,1,t5_2qhpi

Both fonts are easy to read both in print and on screen and there is really no strong argument against one or the other.Its not like Comic Sans Papyrus or even Times New Roman all of which reasonable arguments can be made against depending on medium. If you get in an argument with someone over it it usually ends up coming down to the fact that Arial and Calibri are default system fonts in Windows making everything have a Windowsy look. To that I point out that Helvetica Neue is a system font in OS X and iOS so it ends up giving things an Appley feel by the same logic.

Oh sure a few were so impressed with my gogetter attitude and praised me for my efforts but nobody invited me for an interview.  What did get me an interview was my enthusiasm for aerospace.  In particular I love WWI aircraft and when I applied to a job posting on LinkedIn for a position offered by a former manufacturer of certain WWI aircraft I was sure to mention how fond I was of their WWI aircraft and how great it would be to some how be associated with a name of such historical significance.  That got me an interview.  My enthusiasm during the interview was obvious.  It wasnt faked I really was like a kid in a candy store.  I was so interested in everything I saw and they liked that.  I met their minimum qualifications I got on well with the people I met and I got the job.A little over a year later they had lost a lot of money and had to remove nonproduction e.g. engineering positions.  Everyone else there had been there for  years and I was the new guy so out the door I went.  It wasnt so bad I got to work a production position as a stopgap but I wanted to be an engineer so I went out looking for a new position.The rat race began anew and after a few months I managed to snag another interview with another aerospace company.  This position was very cutting edge.  Again I wasnt particularly qualified and there were certainly scores of higher qualified candidates to choose from.  However I let my enthusiasm show through.  It made such an impression even the HR manager of the corporation had heard from the hiring manager how enthusiastic I was.  I spoke with the HR manager because she was offering me the job you see. I give you these anecdotes because I think its worth considering just how effective genuine enthusiasm can be.  Its not a one trick pony its part of an overall strategy of being personable.  A large part of that is having a desirable attitude and a large part of that is being enthusiastic.  My advice on top of the wonderful advice others have given would be to search for jobs you are truly interested in read How to Win Friends amp Influence People the audio book is also great and work on your people skills.  That book by the way changed my life and Im currently rereading it just because I think its worth it.  At the end of the day a human being is going to be the one that hires you.  Having he or she like you is a great way to increase your odds.  It may require some large effort on your part because you may have to adjust your attitude.  You cant fake it people can spot a fake a mile away.  With effort however you can certainly do it.  If I can  you can.  I dont know anyone more introverted.  I could happily be completely alone for months.  I was also extremely as the college psychologist put it when reading my test results off the charts shy.  You dont have to be the life of the party to learn learn people skills.Take it from a peopleavoiding severely underqualified introvert with no network that has somehow never failed to get a job offer after an interview people skills are as important if not more important than what is on your resume.  ,engineering,ch6fumu,2,t5_2qhpi

It will take longer than being a full time student but less expensive in the long run.Alternatively if you are dead set on academia I would recommend grabbing some researchlab experience if you havent already.

For BA degrees this is EXACTLY the type of tasks that some time should be devoted to in order to have a well rounded understanding of a topic like EE or ME you should have some handson time actually building what you design if only to make sure you have a basic appreciation of what goes on on the other side of the wall.In my experience its much easier to teach design for manufacturing by just having engineers build parts be it as a coop etc. In one company we made it a habit of having the engineer always assemble build any leadpiece on a new product.  If you as the designer cant put together a widget how are you going to expect a line worker with much less education do it.  I highly encourage anyone at the BA level in engineering to get relevant work experience in a machine shop electronics shop or any type of tech job as it makes you much more practical. Sure if youre a PhD you may be getting to tackle the more fun and heady design topics but on a BA level youre doing the barebones engineering work. Being able to do bottom up design and go from whiteboard through to an assembled and inspected part is a critical skill for any engineer.

1252725,0,t1_ciae3ft,I dont mean to down play the importance of CAD. But in my experience thats the part you want to be completed the fastest. Yes you want an accurate model yes you want full documentation but no one wants to spend much time on that phase. Depending on your industry especially if youre in the rampd section of it development and testing usually warrants the most time....as they should. And if the systems guys or the testing guys need a new part or some info off the model they dont want to be sitting around all day.Im a controls systemssystems engineer. I started off in RampD for a medium sized company developing controls dev and testing autonomous systems. The CAD department was literally one guy with a shared skill set. If something broke or we needed a custom part the cad guy would be there to get us up and running again and back to his other duties.Right now Im in the automotive industry developing control units for diesel engines for a fairly large company. The cad dept. is much larger and their role more pivotal however once again we need them crank out those drawings asap so the manufacturing guys can get us our parts so we can go ahead and fullfil customer requirements. CAD is extremely important but in my experience its never the focus.Oh and I think youre nuts to reject the project engineering position for a cad position. When I was in university CAD never had a good stigma. The saying was Never put CATIA on your resume because thats what youll be stuck doing,engineering,ciajp5m,1,t5_2qhpi

1278681,0,t1_cid9ngv,All excellent practical advice. I would hasten to add that extensive prior research and awareness of salient current issues in your field is important particularly those that affect the profession at the firm level migration for public sector clients from a costplus contract model to allin contracts for example. A few well thought through strategic questionsconversation topics about the big picture may leave the interviewer with a different and more positive impression about your long term potential as an employee of the firm your role after the position in question. They are obviously hiring to fulfill the requirements of a specific position however an astute interviewrecruiter is always keeping an eye out for candidates that can check that box and simultaneously have the capability to grow within the organization. Dont get pigeonholed right out of the gate. Anyway just something to consider. Dont overreach either. If you wouldnt have a clue of what you are talking about beyond your oneoff questions or any interest in the way the firm works and its strategic direction etc. then dont bother. You could always turn that into a positive as well and note in the interview that at present you arent very conscious about the larger picture of the consulting world but that you intend to learn more and would hope that the company has mechanisms to support staff in such endeavours. That could open a path for some internal mentorship opportunities as well. Good luck OP.,engineering,cidgw54,3,t5_2qhpi

Other times you are excited to wake up and feel alive. The trick is to learn to manage your stress and time and focus on what is important to you.

1502301,0,t3_2bbxos,While many use the terms patent and invention interchangeably they are not the same thing.I invented many things when I was an engineer. That the firms I worked for never chose to attempt to patent those inventions does not diminish the accomplishment of invention.Im not saying that all of my inventions were groundbreaking amazing things. And my inventions often borrowed bits and pieces from things others had already invented. But my inventions did breathe life into something unique that didnt exist before I invented it.Patents are odd things. Every application for a patent describes an invention. But only those inventions that are judged to be useful novel and nonobvious are granted patents. As with my experience with invention where patent applications were never filed for my inventions a rejection by the patent office does not mean that your invention isnt an invention it only means its not a patentable invention.And just because one obtains a patent for an invention doesnt mean they invented everything in their invention. You may have heard the sayings standing on the shoulders of giants or to bake an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe. Even those inventions which are deemed worthy of a patent rely upon every single invention that had ever been invented up to the invention of the invention that is patented.You may encounter people with patents who think they are special merely because they have patents and you dont.

Solar and wind are doing well but the scaleup has a long way to go. The US generated . of our electricity from solar in .  Storagedispatchability. Photovoltaic peaks at solar noon and pretty much ends at solar  PM while peak demand continues till  or  PM wind blows whenever the hell it feels like it. All night in Texas for instance.

2294521,0,t3_2linfi,Good news youre in the most vague engineering major. Thats why when I decided that Civ E wasnt for me I switched to Mech E. You can do so much with that degree.Now...What exactly about augmented reality interests you? The application of the technology shoving the alreadydesigned technology into an application like medical or gaming or toys? Developing the technology code that actually makes augmented reality? You need to think about the what before you think about the how.gtIs there any way for me to apply an M.E. degree into these interests?Yes but... again... see my answer above.gtIf so how? What do I have to do?And... again... see first answer. If you want to go the application route Mech E could work... like mechatronics or biomech or something. If you want to go the development route itd be wise to switch to Comp Sci.Now if youre still not sure if switching majors is for you do project work research independent study etc. on this type of thing. Find an internship or coop with a company that is in that industry. The reason I knew Civ E wasnt for me? My first coop at a structural firm I knew I wanted to concentrate in Structural Engineering showed me that it wasnt what I thought it would be. If it wasnt for that work experience Id have realized it too late.Another thing...Do you have an academic advisor? You really really need to put them to work to... ya know... do their jobs and advise you in these moments! My alma mater had great academic and coop advisors that always worked for us with our interests in mind at all times. Use them.,engineering,clvbhqe,2,t5_2qhpi

2319478,0,t1_clycf2i,When you look at these degree programs you need to balance Do I give a shit about this and want to spend the next  years working in this field with Will I end up being a technologist in an unrelated field because there are only  jobs in the entire country for my degree.For example Sustainable tech seems nice but not for a primary degree.  Id say its much better to get a Mech E degree do your thesis in sustainable tech and try to get a job doing that sort of work.  At the end of the day you will have a salable degree but you will also be qualified for your choice career.Nuclear Energy Tech  Who uses nuke energy?  The US Navy.  No one else is actually building nuke reactors.  So you get to work for the government or for a government contractor which I hear can kind of suck. EDIT Theres also Nuclear Imaging which is a pretty exciting and quickly evolving field.FlightAero  Good solid field flight isnt going away anytime soon large customers are BOTH private and government so you wont always be at the purchasing whims of Congress.Vehicle Eng  Do you like Detroit?  I hope you want to live in Michigan or work for a subcontractor somewhere...  Not everyone ends up working on an F car remember.  You might end up working for a company that designs suspensions or bumpers.TLDR  A degree is a business decision but its also a decision youll have to live with.  So make sure theres a healthy job market for your degree if not do a generalized field and do your thesis in your field of interest.  Make sure you go to a school that specializes in your field of interest because they will have industry connections to get you a job.,engineering,clyegtp,5,t5_2qhpi

2458411,0,t1_cmfi0u3,Its the sending crap out to have it done that takes all the time. Grinding the cam and crank shafts. Grinding the head and valve seats or finding a replacement head if its screwed up too much. Bearings for the shafts and crank are bought by thickness because of regrinding. There is a range of specific sizes that the shafts are ground to in order to be able to use these bearings. Id hone the cylinders myself if theyre not too bad and everything else is off the shelf parts but youve got to wait for them to be shipped. One bad cylinder that needs relining and you might as well replace them all so everything is of matched size. They dont usually do this step for rebuilt crate engines and will only do just what needs to be done to make it spin without failing inside of a year.. A fully equipped shop with the ability to grind the shafts and good suppliers should be able to rebuild one of these from removal to reinstall in a week. Its really cheaper and far easier to just buy a rebuilt crate engine but you dont know what they did to them. A new crate engine usually costs far more than the car is actually worth. After what I went through I would recommend a rebuilt crate engine every time. Just removal and installation of a crate engine should take one experienced man  days work. A couple of experienced guys getting paid for it should be able to do it in one  hour shift. Mine was a spare engine that I got free that needed rebuilding and I only worked on it a few nights a week at most and the occasional Sunday. Took well me over a year and really dont know how long it took. I was in no rush to do the swap because I knew it would really suck to do. I finally tried to do the swap on a summer weekend that turned into many summer weekends. I owned a  MGB GT. The one with the bubble hatch back. Every time I touched a wire or anything else I was running a new one or repairing something else. It didnt help that I and my car were in the US and this car and all its parts came from England. If I needed a part for this car that I couldnt fix getting a rebuilt or new one took months. So my time to do this work was way longer than it really needed to be. But I knew what I was getting into when I bought this car.  It was a  year old car when I did this so this crap is to be expected. Old MGs have very specific parts when it comes to things like suspension and much of it is designed to be repaired or rebuilt rather than just swapped. The shocksdampers are an integral part of the suspension the upper control arm and you cant drive the car of one goes bad. Things like that went wrong with this car.  The wiring was made by a company named Lucas and the joke is true. Lucas is the prince of darkness. I know how to rebuild an MG. Would I do it again? NO NEVER. I could explain to somebody how to do it but Im not touching it. The day I sold this car was a very happy day indeed. I used to see it once and a while on the road for years. There was only one of these in my state. I havent seen one of these running in years now.  ,engineering,cmfk80x,7,t5_2qhpi

Its only going to get worse. Even tenor track professors are constantly graded in terms of the rake of their students starting salary for their department number of papers published how much they do for the years they have etc. The funneling system is just the way academia works.  I made it through undergrad with minor mental health issues and then tried to enter the job force during the start of a recession. Failing I did the stereotypical things and went where smart people go when they cant get a job Grad school.  The funneling system continued and continued to drive this screw.  Two years in no degree and full on depression took hold. I nearly failed out before getting help. Got several drugs which helped me finish my masters.

2713368,0,t1_cncfajn,Well my argument is that your definition of engineering is general to the point that its what every human does. If you never apply knowledge to do something you will die during the winter when you dont use your knowledge of insulation to put on a jacket to retain heat or stay inside an insulated building or if you ignore your knowledge of momentum transfer and assume it is perfectly safe to play on a highway with fast moving cars. Using your brain by your definition is engineering I and the average person call that being human.If we do not distinguish between an engineer and a person there is no logical reason to have two words for the same concept. Clearly engineer has some special connotation that separates it from just using your brain. The answer of course is that engineering is a special way of using ones brain.gt It may bother a professional physician when a nobody disinfects and bandages a wound calling it medicine but that doesnt change the fact that they are practicing medicine. Does it make them a doctor?In your example you correctly point out that disinfecting and bandaging wounds is different from being a doctor. Healers have existed from the dawn of our species using herbal remedies often alongside chants and rituals to heal. A doctor however approaches the problem of medicine with a scientific mindset figuring out why certain treatments work understanding those treatments and perscribing them accordingly. Anyone can be a healer but only when someone approaches the problem thus are they performing medicine. Certainly you wouldnt argue that if I stood over a sick person waving a wand and shouting get out demons that you would call that medicine even if the person did get better.gt but in my personal experience so far most engineers are terribly lacking in programming skills. So if the noble engineers cant figure it out then how do they justify calling it below themselves?Im an aerospace engineer who doesnt know how to fly an airplane. Many pilots do have degrees in aerospace engineering. I dont consider airplane pilots to be below me but they are not engineers by virtue of having a skillset piloting an airplane simply isnt engineering. gt Is a mechanic an engineer? When I rebuilt my engine under the guidance of a professional mechanic he said we had done a lot of engineering and I did feel taken aback at first... but is constructing an engine from individual parts not engineering?Is constructing an ikea set engineering? You are applying knowledge to construct a cabinet from individual parts. Certainly automechanics are capable of engineering maybe theyll find some problem with an engine that requires a novel solution but simply assembling pieces the way they are meant to be assembled is not engineering.gt Are you sure youre not confusing the title with inventor or designer? very philosophical topic indeed..Inventor and designer are related terms and you can be both all three just two or one at any given time. An inventor is someone who comes up with a new idea to improve structures machines devices systems materials and processes. Designer has two definitions. One is a person comes up with a plan to build or improve something. The other definition is someone who creates an image sound or other aesthetic. You can certainly invent without engineering and you can engineer without inventing. In freshman year of college I slept in a bunkbed but my room was very hot so I ductaped a fan to my ceiling to keep me cool. That was inventing. A few nights later it fell from the ceiling because I had not engineered a solution. I did not really apply any detailed knowledge to the problem beyond the fact that tape holds stuff together.You can certainly aesthetically design things without engineering. Moviemakers design space ships all the time those space ships are not engineered however. Whether you can engineer something without ever designing it is a more difficult philosophical question to which I would probably say no. That said there is certainly a great deal of engineering which is not design for example doing testing.To get back to the original point though the main reason for my argument is that I am an engineer by both training and by trade. I am a programmer who has done quite a number of projects. I am not however a software engineer in any sense of the word. I may use code to solve problems but I dont solve any code problems. Of course I debug and such and if I come across any improvements I implement them but all the real innovation all the original thought was done by others.,engineering,cnchzbr,7,t5_2qhpi

Radar is really common although expensive it is best for when you need speed data too.  Cameras are common but have issues with weather.  For temporary detection pneumatic tubes are common basically a rubber tube stretched across the road the tire creates a pulse that a pressure sensor can detect.  peizo electric sensors are out there although not really common as they are expensive.  ,engineering,cnj147v,6,t5_2qhpi

2818115,0,t3_2sd8xe,Yes size matters because of one  very important reason gravity. The smaller a bridge the more it can generally support relative to its weight. The larger a bridge the more effect gravity has on the members and the less additional weight it can take relative to its size.For example consider a x steel beam Fy   psi  in length. This beam can take  lbin assuming no lateraltorsional buckling is possible. Make that beam a x steel beam with the same properties and proportions and it can take  lbin.Aha! The big one takes ten  times the load of the small one and its ten  times bigger right? No. Its a hundred times bigger. As you get larger and larger eventually it gets to the point that the beam cannot support its own weight. Now granted the point where this happens is with beams that have astronomical dimensions but the point remains gravity has a larger effect on larger structures.,engineering,cnoevbs,5,t5_2qhpi

Add in knowledge of the particular platforms or technologies that a company uses and you can push K.The guys doing research in CS are university faculty.

Ask them what transmission fluid to use theyll tell you to use something called Uncle Scottys cocktail. Thats great for a bandaid if your synchros are dying and you just need something to smooth them out long enough to get to a shop and replace the synchros otherwise you really have to take into account three fluid will turn acidic very quickly and eat away at the archaic synchros just making matters worse.

2917624,0,t3_2sxbuo,Hello fellow Redditors.I am a freshman year college student currently attending a community college in Maryland. I have recently considered a career in engineering. However Im not sure if its a good fit. Originally my plan was to major in political science then go to law school. However bad job prospects and career reconsideration made me scratch that idea. Admittedly Im still a bit too young to decide on a major still in the whole experimenting phase. But Id like something that gets me a job. However  on the flip side while a career in engineering could net me a great job I am intensely fearful of all those math and science classes the all nighters the lack of a social life or free time etc. Im not good at math and science but am willing to work around those handicaps. Overall my main question is this should I pursue something Id be good at or passionate for which would be political science then perhaps law school or something that could net me a good income business degree like accounting or finance engineering medicine one of the trades?Some other informationwould like to make the world a better place and help people as cliche as that soundsgood at communicating memorizing researching and writing as well as listening to and caring for other peopledont want to be in school for too long mostly due to health money and safetywhy Im considering engineeringcan definitely make the world a better placeknowing how things work is interesting even though Im not a naturally scientifically inclined persongood pay and prestigewhy I wouldntstereotypes such as lack of social life and intensive math and science courses even though Im not much of a party person Id still like to have some free timewouldnt want to be lodged up in a cubicle all day though I am a sedentary person Id like a mixture of sedentary and nomadic tasks at worknot even sure which engineering Id do,engineering,cnzqpze,0,t5_2qhpi

2925469,0,t3_2tnkn0,Computational fluid dynamics is probably the most appropriate approach but for a first approximation you could probably use the drag coefficient. You would need to know the stream velocity and the fluid properties i.e. viscosity density. Unless you do your own testing approximate the object as a sphere cylinder or other wellunderstood shape to get the dragcoefficient vs. Reynolds number data. Calculate the Reynolds number to find what you should expect the drag coefficient to be.      For a drag coefficent D  the force you would expect your object to feel from the fluid is given by  D  F  .  r  Av  In which F is the force felt r is the fluid density A is the projected area and v is the bulk velocity of the fluid.,engineering,co0mvp6,2,t5_2qhpi

The idea is to provide a toy that would allow a child to find out if they like that stuff or not because otherwise they may never know.  The idea that everyone has some inherent calling for a profession is also something I entirely disagree with.  Plenty of people dont know what they want to do and plenty of people have interests that change.  This toy is not something that is being forced on anyone but is something that may allow young girls to realize they may like something that society has insisted they wouldnt really enjoy.  I am getting the vibe from your posts that if a girl doesnt like this toy shes not made to be an engineer and that if she were to like this toy then she would already know engineering is for her.

3504985,0,t1_cprq12g,Software Engineer is a protected title in Canada.  This is especially appropriate since there are now full  year engineering degree programs that offer degrees in software engineering.  However  the reason for the protection is that it protects the public from misrepresentation.  For example if I as a member of the public who is not well versed in technical matters hire a software engineer to work on a large critical software subsystem of something lets say a controller for a large motor or turbine or some other high power piece of machinery.   Since you are claiming to be a software engineer I assume that you are educated and experienced enough to handle this task and will follow standard conventions best practices and that your code will be safe.   This is a requirement of professional engineers to know their limitations and to decline work or refer them to a more experienced engineer if they feel like they are getting in over their head.  If an engineer screws up they are liable and puniscabHowever if you are like you say actually just a web developer who was overly ambitious and bid on a project that they could not handle then you are putting the public at risk.   If you write software that could cause an overload or cause physical damage to equipment then you could be putting lives at risk. Even though a title in something like this might seem innocuous it tends to muddy the waters and can cause confusion in the public.  For example another title that is not allowed in Canada is the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer.    Or AudioSound Engineer. If you really are a web developer then I dont see why you would call yourself anything else.  Web developer is a perfectly acceptable title that very easily lets the public understand what you do.  Even software developer would be an acceptable title but engineer is protected because an engineer can and does work on projects that might cost lives if improperly handled.,engineering,cprsk68,6,t5_2qhpi

3536022,0,t3_30qd93,rockdude is correct that the whole sampling at greater than twice the frequency is referring to the nyquist sampling theorem. Reading any signal in through a computer has to be discrete at some level so oscilloscopes basically look at the input every x seconds and output what they read at those intervals. So if I have a Hz sample rate every  second I look at my input and say what the voltage level is. The nyquist theorem says that I can only accurately see what an input signal is if I sample more than twice the input frequency. So if my input signal is a Hz sinusoid I need an oscillosope that samples at greater than Hz. Just as a quick testproof of that imagine sampling with an exactly Hz oscilloscope which would mean youre looking at the input signal every . seconds. The input signal is Hz which means a period of  second. So if I sample every . seconds I could accidentally read the input sinusoid every time it switches from high to low or low to high meaning I would read  V every time I sampled the signal and think that the input signal was just a flat V line. As long as I sample more than twice per a period I can see the sinusoid shape and correctly identify the input signal.As for the statistics part of your question the sampling rate of an oscilloscope only effects the confidence of a measurement in a binary way if my sample rate is greater than twice the input frequency I know almost  what my input signal is otherwise I cant know what my input signal is. Im assuming the input signal is only a normal sinusoid. If there are any fluctuations that occur in a time interval that is faster than my sampling rate there is a chance my oscilloscope could not see the spikes but thats the only way I could see the sampling rate affecting the confidence of your measurement.The rest of your questions Im not so sure on though statistics wasnt something I really learned to much about. In general it just seems that statistics show how consistent a result is but I know theres more to itthings you can interpret from them,engineering,cpvbvd6,3,t5_2qhpi

We rarely get into  percent humidity here maybe in the mornings. Evaporative cooling doesnt work when near saturation.How much money is your water per liter? Will you have water treatment at your facility? How many cycles before the sump should be dumped? Again how much evaporation are you expecting to have to make up?

With the money saved from using your cheaper parts you could buy another gas turbine and cycle that while you are down for a maintanance outage. I think it will be  years before the industry catches on to this. Unlike aero where the oem often retains ownership of the unit and leases its use to the customer in powergen the unit is owned by the customer. He decides whos parts he buys and who installs them.

3699489,0,t3_32a2i4,AISC Design Guide  is dedicated to this topic. Floor vibrations due to human activity. Generally the design guide does not limit deflections the Building code does that L for total load. This design guide sets specific criteria for floor vibrations as they are related to their natural frequency and the peak accereration.Here is a excerpt from chapter . in the design guide which talks about the human response to floor motion. Human response to floor motion is a very complex phenomenoninvolving the magnitude of the motion the environmentsurrounding the sensor and the human sensor. A continuousmotion steadystate can be more annoying than motioncaused by an infrequent impact transient. The threshold ofperception of floor motion in a busy workplace can be higherthan in a quiet apartment. The reaction of a senior citizenliving on the fiftieth floor can be considerably different fromthat of a young adult living on the second floor of an apartmentcomplex if both are subjected to the same motion.The reaction of people who feel vibration depends verystrongly on what they are doing. People in offices or residencesdo not like distinctly perceptible vibration peakacceleration of about . percent of the acceleration of gravityg whereas people taking part in an activity will acceptvibrations approximately  times greater  percent g ormore. People dining beside a dance floor lifting weightsbeside an aerobics gym or standing in a shopping mall willaccept something in between about . percent g. Sensitivitywithin each occupancy also varies with duration of vibrationand remoteness of source. The above limits are forvibration frequencies between  Hz and  Hz. Outside thisfrequency range people accept higher vibration accelerations as shown in figure . Figure . external linkAs you can see shopping malls can be designed for around . peak acceleration. This vibration is not perceivable when you are walking however when you are standing or sitting near the mid span of certain beamsslabs you may feel that the vibrations are uncomfortable.

4025088,0,t3_36lf7s,I did an MSc in advanced structural engineering in Edinburgh but I ended up doing mainly hydrotechnical analysis. Ive worked mainly on large projects in BC and Canada with some proposal work for global projects. Its a very interesting field because it combines so many engineering disciplines to solve problems that are usually very unique. The coolest stuff Ive done is analysis of energy dissipation throughout a rock tunnel during emergency drawdown procedures spillway designanalysis helping calibrate physical hydraulic models dam failure analysis concept design for run of river hydro. I do really enjoy the work because much of it is outside the boundaries of the code so you can be a little more academic and you have more freedom as an engineer. Youre not as confined as a buildingbridge engineer who can only operate strictly within the parameters of X code of practice. AND you dont have architects bullshitting their way through design meetings. Its quite a niche market but I enjoy it. My favourite aspect is the chance to investigate so many sciences in one project any large dam will have major environmentalgeotechnicalgeomorphologicalstructuralhydrotechnicalhydrologicalcivilmechanicalelectrical components so its a great way to get a feel for engineering above and beyond your degree program. Just my two cents. Im currently in Scotland building a cable stay bridge its definitely cool going into the extreme detail of the structural issues but if I had to choose long term I think hydro is more enjoyable. Then again the issue is if you get stationed on site for construction youre looking at  years on a camp in the middle of the mountains that would piss me off.

They had a license from Protel to use their old DOS code including the popular Autotrax and they used it to produce a windows package called Circuit Maker and Trax Maker.  Protel had their own Windows package and so ended up in competition with Microcode. Protels version was buggy and not too stable as I recall. Then Protel changed hands and became Altium. Altium then bought out Microcode and CircuitMakerTraxMaker faded away.

I would really like you to explain this further in a context pertaining to my comment. You can destroy an area that is thriving economically by implementing this treatment throughout. It will create a huge bottleneck that drivers will avoid and thus driving down commercial traffic conversions. gt to mention land use is really the essence of the problem.It absolutely is god awful planning and unexpected growth have created areas where its dangerous to even be a pedestrian near a major arterial. gt Engineers work in a bubble  thats why something like a PSA sounds so attractive. If we can just explain to the stupid people how stupid they are and get them to not be so stupid then our problems will be solved. The world doesnt work that way.Im glad you brought this up. Take a gander  the stats show that the PSA is working through the Triple E approach Education Enforcement and Engineering.     Central Florida is a poster child for the worst kind of engineering in the country and it does manifest in higher collision rates and the major issue with pedestrians that you cite. When you say We have fatalities on roadways that are designed to the highest safety standards that should tell you something The highest safety standard as currently presented by our engineering codes is not working.If you have seen the fatal crashes that are on these roadways you will understand. You cant engineer everything with SAFER walls from a nascar track...    Heres an article I wrote recently about a project were working on in Lafayette LA. Economics is driving the entire thing and its the engineers who are revealed as having little understanding.        Okay thats a great biased opinion. It sounds like you should be going after the accountants. What does this have to do with roadway safety on your so called Stroads? You did however raise a fundamental argument how are we supposed to reconstruct these new roadways and upgrade pedestrian features lighting and drainage when we can not even afford to even maintain what we have?

4546213,0,t3_3d55jh,For EIS you should report resistances in Ohmscm. It does seem counterintuitive but you are really reporting resistivity which is the inverse of conductvity which is Siemenscm. It might help to think of it as R  VI where if I is current density Ampscm R needs to be in Ohmscm.It is a measure of how much current will flow through your coating given a potential and a surface area.If you are trying to publish or obtain more precise data than simple comparisons for your own internal use I would strongly recommend finding a potentiostat and someone to help you use it. If you are a grad student check your chemistry department as well as engineering. If they do any kind of electrochemistry they will have a potentiostat. If not contact other universities many will probably be happy to help out. To measure the coating resistance accurately you need to accurately know the potential between the substrate and the solution the current flow out of the substrate the resistance of the electrolytic double layer EDL and the resistance of the solution between your electrodes. When you measure the resistance by applying direct current you cant decouple these facts. also you need a really precise control and measurement of potential and current. You also need to know the potential of the solution right near the surface of your coating. A potentiostat will allow you to use a rd electrode as a reference allowing you to measure this more directly and control potential with the solution not potential with the counter electrode which is not the same. you also cant tell how much the solution resistance and resistance from the counter electrode contributes to your total. ideally you want to measure the coating on its own.EIS is also powerful because by measuring impedance changes as a function of frequency you can make judgments about the various effects of solution resistance EDL resistance and capacitance as well as coating resistance. it can also tell you about diffusion through your coating how porous it is etc. Gamrys site has a pretty good explanation here,engineering,ct3ocgx,1,t5_2qhpi

Cfdonline is a great forum and cfd by Anderson is an amazing book for concepts.

4612759,0,t1_ctb6vej,Okay being constantly busy and pulled in different directions is actually bad for creativity and problem solving. Thats one of my areas of interest in research.Problem solving and creativity doesnt just happen its the result of a deceptively long effort of thought.So you need to focus on reclaiming some time that you can actually put toward problem solving and being creative. Ideas include Doing task analysis of your day for  weeks. Every hour write down everything you did during that hour. After  weeks try to spot tasks you can cut out delegate to someone else or make more efficient. Use a project management system to help you organise your tasks. That way you can spend far less time trying to figure out what your next task is. Bump up your notes game. If you take notes file them away in a place dedicated to that project. It could be a specific folder or some project management systems allow you to upload and keep notes. Checklists and evaluations. If youre anything like me and you find yourself doing the same things over and over and having the same conversations with people take some of that mental burden off yourself with checklists and evaluations. For example Ive got a checklist amp evaluation combo I created to help me source requirements when Im beginning a project. It has drastically reduced the number of errors associated with getting the wrong info at the start of a project which drastically reduces the time spent on the project. Start noting at which points projects tend to go off the rails or at which points you tend to put in more work than expected. After you know these things you can work on fixing them. Try to cut everything out of your work day that isnt immediately important or doesnt require your degree. If somebody else can do it see if somebody else can do it because it may not be the best use of your time.,engineering,ctc0p4g,5,t5_2qhpi

4671270,0,t1_ctjaji1,I wrote my thesis in word.  pages  references and cross references to tables figures and equations  figures and tables  numbered equations and  appendices. The process was iterative and words functionality was indispensable. Moving figure paragraphs and sections was as easy as copy and paste. Ive also written many documents of intermediate length around  pages each with many iterations by multiple authors. This is another advantage of word since collaborators will often prefer to use word. The advantages of word are only available if you setup the styles and formats before writing. So if you take the time to setup your document first you will not need to worry about any of the formatting later. If you choose to make changes later then it is very easy to apply the changes throughout the document. I realize both latex and word have these features but I find that they are easier to use and access in word. In saying all of this I am referring only to Word  or later versions. Before that the features of word were not very easy to access or use. As others have pointed out latex is better for automatic or procedurally created documents. However it is still necessary to write other documents and in those instances word is faster and easier to use. I highly recommend everyone spends half a day learning about styles cross references and numbered lists. If anyone would like the resources I used to learn these techniques Id be happy to look them up. I fully understand where a lot of the negative reviews of word come from and from my experience it derives from people using what I consider as the novice set of features. Once people learn the advanced set of features they often change their opinion of the software. So if you are interested in the full power of the software please take the time to learn more. I think youll find a lot of benefits. ,engineering,ctjd5q7,1,t5_2qhpi

The pay is much better of there but doesnt necessarily come in the form of cash. A lot of companies will pay for relocation put you up in a house give you a car and even gas money. Not to mention schooling for children. The only real expense we had was groceries. Not to mention that all income is close to tax free. My dad has told me with all the perks and increased pay you are looking at around  times as much money.A lot of expats we met over there would come over for a couple years to save up a bunch of money. The best perk about living there though is the traveling. We traveled all over the world. My dad got all holidays were accustomed to in America off thanksgiving new years christmas along with Muslim holidays Eid Haj. This leads to a lot of travel time.

But many companies souks be able to provide you with a simulation of your situation and expected force profiles. The one time I required such data from a hydraulic bump stop maker I provided the mass and velocity along with orientation.

As a result Ive been expanding my search quite a bit both in scope and geographically. This has lead me to ish questionsFirst of all how much of a disadvantage am I at for finding work in the US being a noncitizen and how much would completing the FE mitigate this?Secondly how do Civil companies view Mining Engineers? This seems to be the most logical direction to go as there is quite a bit of overlap between the disciplines. Also how should I adjust my resume for Civil positions?

Went on with them full time after I finished my M.S. Admittedly I have to attribute a big part of that to luck but on the other hand you definitely have to network. The unfortunate reality is that it is who you know until you get the job then it becomes what you know. So polish off your resume and start handing it to people who look important. Or grad school.

6060308,0,t3_3yiv7g,I am Canadian did my BASc and MASc there and then moved abroad to do my PhD to the Netherlands and am now working in the UK.  I got both positions by being specialized enough for my employers to get the relevant visa.  Before applying I spent a lot of time on google looking for job aggregate sites researching companies looking for positions and reading up on immigration stuff.  For the applications I just used the recruitment websites of the companies.  In general when moving to Europe without a European passport being adequately specialized is the main problem.  Since youre an EU citizen though it should be relatively easy for companies to hire you so the main problems will be obviously finding the job ads themselves.  There is no single job aggregator that will do this for you and it will take a lot of time but its your best bet to just identify as many large international companies as you can in the countries of interest and look at each companys job page individually.  Pages like this list of German engineering companies and this list of Germany pharmaceutical companies could get you started.  You can further look at magazines or government offices oriented around a certain trade like this one or use  national job aggregators like jobs.co.uk figuring out what the equivalent educational credentials in your country of interest are to the Canadian equivalents.  For example some Dutch companies still use the technically obsolete term WO to mean university education to the masters level.  Youll then have to convince companies that your educational credentials are equivalent to the required educational credentials.  This is probably easier with larger companies and will be much simpler if you have some demonstrable skill that theyre looking for.  This is relevant since most universitytrained engineers in Europe have a masters and finishing university with a bachelors is not the norm like it is in Canada.  However a bachelors  masters in Europe requires less time and independent work than a bachelors  masters in Canada  in fact my bachelors had more credits than a Dutch bachmasters degree combined.  Companies may not be aware of this so you may have to keep this in mind when preparing for your application. getting interviews  when I applied for my PhD the university flew me out to the Netherlands for an interview and later paid my moving costs.  This will not always be the case so youll be at a disadvantage to more local applicants if it costs them money to interview you.  Can you go somewhere for a few months and look for work that way?   language problems.  Not speaking the local language will be more of a problem in some countries than others.  In technical fields this may be less of a problem than some others but youll still have to deal with a lot of administrative stuff in a language you may not speak so demonstrating some willingness to learn or some basic proficiency with language learning in general i.e. already being multilingual in other languages cant hurt your cause.Best of luck with your search!

When consuming cannabis it has to be heated to a certain point so the THC interacts with the human body so it as a psychoactive effect. In the case of bongs and joints the plant material is heated up to the point of combustion which while convenient is far from the most efficient way to use cannabis and inhaling smoke filtered through water or not is not good on the human lungs. I do not know the exact workings of a hair dryer but I would assume it would be very easy to use its components to heat up cannabis to the point right before combustion when it produces vapor.

They go cheap and have little to nothing maybe some D Autocad or some cheap D CAD product or pirated software.  They buy into the high end CAD as a necessity and generally get what they or their engineers know from college or past work experience. typically Solidworks or Pro Engineer.  Or they go to some other premium or specialized CAD program they deem ideal for their engineering function thats equally good but different.Your mainstream CAD is Solidworks and Pro Engineer.  Solidworks is both cheaper and much easier and more intuitive to learn.  Ive taught people Solidworks whove never used CAD before and had them designing parts assemblies prints BOMs and even toying with FEA mostly on their own within two weeks.  Thats an impossibility with Pro Engineer.  Pro Engineer is a pain to learn on the fly.  If I was to teach someone Pro Engineer I would hand them the same text book I had in college and tell them to start on page  and work all the way through reading everything and doing every example.

Basic knowledge of design control will set you apart from your competition. Ive been told explicitly by an engineering manager that understanding this process will ensure his interest in a candidate. You can let them know you are aware of this document by asking relevant questions like How would you characterize your design control process? Some companies have a more minimal approach to design control while others go above and beyond what is needed. Since the company appears to be so small you could ask Do you have resources like dedicated quality engineers and regulatory experts who can help the engineers navigate the process? You can ask them about their company values like what they prioritize in a project like time to market vs. quality assurance.

6604327,0,t1_d02da5v,gtIn  the case finally came to trial. The verdict was mixed with acquittals and convictions. Although they no longer owned National City Lines the companies in the consortium were fined wristslapping amounts of  each while individual company officials were fined  each for a total of . By then the farflung suburbs were crisscrossed by cars highways and a few freeways and the socalled conspiracy plot simply applied the coup de grace to a dying system.It was too late by the time the case came to trial. They already made their millions.It kind of bothers me that its called a conspiracy as it implies that there is little to no evidence. This isnt one of those cases where people are looking for Illuminati triangles or dividing and multiplying dates. This is something that actually happened and has clearly affected the lives of everyone in the United States.From the Wikipedia article linked above gtAt the hearings in April  San Francisco mayor and antitrust attorney Joseph Alioto testified that General Motors and the automobile industry generally exhibit a kind of monopoly evil adding that GM has carried on a deliberate concerted action with the oil companies and tire companies...for the purpose of destroying a vital form of competition namely electric rapid transit. Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley also testified saying that GMthrough its subsidiaries namely PCL scrapped the Pacific Electric and Los Angeles streetcar systems leaving the electric train system totally destroyed.These are the mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles calling out GM for deliberately destroying electric rapid transport in the United States.Some critics argue that the death of electric rail cars was only expedited by GM and that it was doomed for failure. However looking at other countries rail systems I have a hard time believing that.As for its effects on the American population it could be seen as beneficial. Yes  people die every year in the United States from automobile accidents which could be considerably decreased if substantially more people had the option of using a safer alternative but you have to consider the positives as well.Because of poor and limited public transportation in the United States pretty much everyone owns a car. If you dont own a car youre either under  or a nobody. Cars allow for a great deal of freedom a core American value as it allows the driver to chose their destination. They arent bound by a designated route. Not only that cars isolate people which can be argued increases individuality. Americans are alone for long periods of time in their commutes separating them from humanitys natural conforming behavior.Perhaps one can argue GMs dismantling of Americas electric rapid transit has increased our freedom and individuality at the price of  souls a year.,engineering,d02fxly,-1,t5_2qhpi

I work for one of the largest engineering companies in the world and my manager was involved in my salary negotiations because he has a certain budget to build and manage his team. So his approval does depend on what Im getting paid. That said he did fight for a higher salary for me upon hiring so that I could leave my other job. The salary I was asking for was a little bit higher than my previous job and he knew that. I understand where OP is coming from in this post. I got boned pretty hard by an independent recruiting firm on my first job out of school. I undervalued myself and the way the whole deal was structured wasnt really in my best interest. Be careful. Remember that those companies have to charge for their services and sometimes that means it comes out of your salary directly or indirectly. On the flip side as a young engineer you should not make the mistake of thinking you have anything to offer that cant be found in another candidate. Its easy to feel like you know everything right out of school but trust me you dont. I learned this pretty fast. Im not saying any of this applies to you  urfgrunt. And I do agree that in any negotiation the first person to name their price usually loses.

Currently working in production support in an IT company in the telecommunications billing industry.About my collegeUniversity Abominable. The teaching the grading system the courses the lab classes were simply pathetic. There was no foundation to anything that was taught. The professors simply showed up wrote a bunch of equations asked us to learn them and plug values in the formulas get the answers and score marks. Now I being a puritan in matters of learning would follow a groundup approach to learning things and would end up mastering the basics and learning very little of what was in the syllabus. This is how I ended up with this garbage grade.Also I had pretty much made my mind up to absolutely pursuing fields other than engineering until one fine day my friend told me about Coursera. There I saw an enormous wealth of knowledge that was hidden from me all these years. I took EPFLs DSP course and even though I could not make it past week  I loved the pedagogy. I absolutely loved the way the subject was approached with a strong mathematical background. Although it was a bit hard to follow it all made sense and that was the most important thing to me. I was and still am completely awed by the work of Dr. Vetterli and his colleagues at the LCAV Lab. The projects undertaken by the lab is something I would want to really get into.Fast forward to today Here I am. Utterly confused as to what should I do to get an admission in EPFL. I really want to get my masters from EPFL and I know an impassioned Statement of Purpose isnt a way to get it. EPFL is in my opinion equivalent to the Ivy League schools and my profile is a poster boy for rejection for the Selections Committee. So what should I do? Contribute to DSPrelated open source projects? Write independent research papers? Or simply come back to EPFL for PhD?I would appreciate any advice.

Then make sure all your pulleyshookstieoffs are compatible with what you picked. Build your frame tall enough. The pulleys eat up some of the height. Get a long enough rope. If you build pulleys just like  it reduces the load by a factor of  only  lbs pull force and also increases the length of rope by a factor of  if your frame is  feet tall youll probably need XX approx  feet of rope. Get a cleat mounted on your frame to tie off the rope. They sell them for flag poles boats etc.If youre fancy you could get a hand winch to lift your bucket and keep the rope from getting everywhere.

7338613,0,t3_4ftvkw,One belief that I have seen brought up often in the discussion of automation and the elimination of the need for labor is that eventually people will only need to with a couple of hours a week. Unfortunately the distribution of labor doesnt work this way. For example consider a factory that employs  workers for  hours per week each and produces  widgets per week with the  manhours. The employees are all paid  per hour so the labor cost per widget is . Then the factory upgrades to an automated system. Suddenly they can produce  widgets with just  manhours. They can still sell widgets at the same price so they could afford to pay the  workers hour for  hours a week. They would make the same wage per week but would have more free time. They could even earn less say  per hour and still maintain the same standard of living because widgets and by extension all other consumer goods can be produced for half the price. This does not happen for several reasons. First the factory would rather pay  employees to work  hours a week than pay  employees to work  hours a week since there are other fixed costs per employee. Second the tasks of operating and maintaining equipment require a higher skill level than making widgets by hand. Many of the original  employees will not have this skill level and may not be capable of attaining it. The ones that can rise to the challenge will demand a higher wage because of their now more valuable skills. Third and this relates back to the first point there will always be workers willing to work  hours a week even if they can live comfortably on  hours a week at their wage. Naturally an employer is going to higher one skilled worker who is willing to put in a full week over three or four who will only work a day or two. Im not sure what the answer is but its already apparent that there are three distinct labor classes in our society the highly educatedhighly skilled doctors engineers teachers lawyers etc the less educatedmoderately skilled welders medical techs factory workers etc and the uneducatedunskilled fast food workers wait staff construction laborers etc.  The highest and lowest skilled classes are unlikely to be replaced by automation right now since technology isnt advanced enough to replace our doctors with robots and baristas are cheaper to higher than it is to develop an effective robotic substitute. That leaves the less educated skilled workers that are being automated out of existence. While some will be able to adapt to the changing landscape many will have to shift downward into the unskilled category and few will move up into the higher category. Eventually we will be left with only highly skilled and unskilled labor which is already happening signaled by the growing socioeconomic divide. ,engineering,d2cclyc,2,t5_2qhpi

This concept is really first touch upon in fluid mechanics where the state function is first totally differentiated with respect to all variables then integrated after multiplication with various powers of one of its variables to arrive at the various equations used in that discipline. You might see it later in an advanced structures or mechanics course where the zeroth moment of area of a beam is its shear resistance the first moment of area locates the neutral axis of the beam among other things the second moment of area is its bending resistance.If you want to see this taken to its logical conclusion take a look at MatLabs SimScape library inside of Simulink this does exactly what youre thinking.,engineering,d2grdno,1,t5_2qhpi

Although it was nearly  years ago I hope I can provide some insight into what engineers and scientists are looking for in dig sites and how they plan to bury the problematic nuclear waste long half life and high energyIt is planned to bury the waste around m deep in clay layers that have been stable for millions of years. The waste will be buried in containers made of around  different layers from glass fiber to concrete that are supposed to stop radiation from escaping while being transported and once the facility is full and sealed in concrete are supposed to degrade in   years. Afterwards it is estimated that the waste will take  millions years to move and emerge on the surface. At that point there will be no high energy radiation and the waste will be so dispersed it wont be noticeable from background radiation. Its also important to note this waste is supposed to sit at least  years in concrete building being cooled so we still have time to figure out the best locations and way to bury this high energy long term waste.And sorry for any mistakes English is not my native language ,engineering,d3h2avn,6,t5_2qhpi

I recently found a passion to pursue Computer Vision and want to go to graduate school for it however the schools that I got into do not have a good focus on computer vision. I got accepted for a job after college not computer vision based so I am wondering how hard would it be to take a year off and work at my job while studying computer vision to reapply at the school I wanted to go. The school I want to go is the school I am already going to right now for undergraduate. What is the process like for me to take a year off and re apply for graduate school again?

Its not too late and if you have dedication to bettering yourself coupled with a passion for any field of Engineering you can succeed. As Ive experienced so far classes are  learning and  dedication. You learn a lot but you spend most of your time trying to learn the material. So being bad at Math may just mean that you havent worked hard enough at it so far. Ask your potentially new college if they have tutoring centers that will help you succeed. As far as how often Math is used? I work for a laser manufacturer as a test technician and most of what I do when designing is Algebrabased. You need the concepts of higher level Maths in order to understand why things happen or how they are constructed or measured but that will come with hard work and exposure.

Not going to lie... like anyone whos used drugs more than in passing I sold them but never made any real profit.  Im not innocent and not trying to defend myself just giving backstory for the curious.Since that day in  and the trial soon after I got my ass back in school got an AA  years after my first class in community college and after that a BSCE and MCE in  years.   I only applied to two state universities and both required judicial reviews one of which was a simple interview with some basic questions that lasted for  minutes and the other was a  person panel that went on for about  hours.   I mention the admission process because I wanted to share and ask how it went for you if you applied to university after being convicted.My first engineering job was an internship in college which was  luck small family shop and I happened to walk in looking for some scrap metal school project when they were looking for an intern to draft and manage projects.  The next job I landed was at a small growing firm in the early s which was seeking an engineer with other talents that I happen to have.  The guy liked me because of my interest in these other aspects and hired me I filled out the application on my first day and checked the box yes but did not fill out the  x  explanation box.  A couple of years later he took me out to lunch and let me know that he was aware of my past and that he did not notice that I checked yes he wanted let me know that he didnt have a problem with it and admitted that he would have likely not hired me if he had noticed.Also I once interviewed for a position at a geotechnical engineering company that handled sinkhole investigations and they told me in the interview after noticing the yes box being checked flat out that I would not be hired because the insurance companies would question my credibility as an expert witness.EDIT TLDR Have a felony got a job because boss didnt notice I checked yes later told me he wouldnt have hired me because of it.,engineering,d57dub3,45,t5_2qhpi

A really good position to get an overall understanding of how engines work is thermodynamic cycle analyst and historically those entry level positions come open relatively frequently because people spend a few years getting to understand the whole system and then move on to more focused specialties.

Im a few years out of  and wanted to know what would be to get the most cost effectivetime effective way to get a solid education in either aerospace electrical or mechanical engineering. Im open to nontraditional routes community college classes to do the pre requisites online programs going overseas.

8683192,0,t1_d6qvmim,I worked labor at a place in HS full time over two summers.  I really liked the job and the guys there.  They were a rougher crowd but welcomed me in  taught me alot.  One day I was being negative about school and either said or implied Id maybe be better suited for a job like my summer one.  The guy I was helped stopped me cold.  I never saw him so serious.  He told me to go to school  get my engineering degree  and dont look back.  He got into the health issues he had and other guys suffered where they went from high paying oil rig type jobs to broken alcoholics and drug addicts making a fraction of what they used to.Now that wont happen to everyone.  But having that dude be real with me stuck with me.  I almost quit during college after my sophomore year.  An older engineer I knew from family functions said he felt the same way.  But he stuck it out.  Got his degree  and used it to open doors and eventually own a very successful business.  I am glad I listened.  I give give countless examples of people I have met or been influenced by.  But you wont regret that degree if you use it right. That being said  if you want to do strictly engineering and are in it for the money.  Probably not a great choice.  But if you go to a school that is reasonably priced  you get a degree in an engineering field  you can use that to move into management  sales  etc.  and use that to move up and make big bucks.  Get a degree in business management during your first few years out of school while you are making good money.  Might even find a company that will pay for it! I dont have a million dollar home.       No fancy sports car.  But four years out of school I have nearly zero debt.  I own a home.  Bought a car brand new last year and paid most of it off.  Bought a truck outright this year.  I fly somewhere for vacation every year.  Blah blah you get the idea. My life is very comfortable  I need for little and I can do most everything I want within reason.  All of that was provided by engineering and making good choices.  ,engineering,d6r0vw4,31,t5_2qhpi

8904684,1,t1_d7i3qt3,gt Its also hard to have a purely technical discussion when there are so many variables that are still unknownAllow me to inquire we can have a solid educated guess for m ranging from somewhere between  to  tons. We know g it has been empirically verified time and time again .ms. h is no secret either  meters or if the CoM is assumed let us say  meters. And we can observe and measure t from the video evidence and although there is some uncertainty due to the dust  to roughly at most  seconds if we are really generous should be a reasonable estimate. Granted that still gives us quite a range for a but in any case the logical reasonable conclusion remains that only a small fraction of the original structural strength provided any resistance to the downwards motion or as I said in my TLP gt  for the top of the North Tower to accelerate at .g the resistance of the structure can only be .g. But the structure was evidently built with a Factor of Safety in mind  let us be conservative and say it was only . IOW instead of providing a force three times greater than necessary to hold up its own weight it exerted only little more than a third of it  roundabout  of the structural integrity had to vanish to facilitate the smooth constant joltless downwards acceleration of the roofline. In the most abstract and objective technical sense vast amounts of energy had to be present in the Twin Towers which simply do not belong into a healthy lawabiding office building. It is a purely technical analytical argument as abstract descriptive and objective as possible without any emotional charge speculation or political undertone. It is even corroborated by BazantVerdures Equation  and Fig.  in Mechanics of Progressive Collapse Eg gtgt Ep || Fc ltlt mg. It should be easy to refute it with the same logic math and physics if it were false  or be conceded if it is true and sound. Instead it got downvote brigaded without comment to seven hells although I a layman arrived at the same conclusion a physics teacher and a mechanical engineer the latter of which said essentially the same thing in this thread have drawn by the simple application of Newtons Laws of Motion and sixthgrade high school level Classical Mechanics. ,engineering,d7i7q25,2,t5_2qhpi

Alternating semesters workinggoing to school until I had a year of experience.time management is an integral part of all of the listed reasons and can be the difference between success and failure in almost every case.lean manufacturing is the biggest movement in manufacturing in the past forty years. This questions requires more specificity.Manufacturing mindsets rely on a system of continuous improvement. This implies that a company can always be better. Until a company is LEED certified generates more power than it uses produces uranium with  efficiency grows financially .month has zero scrap and gives away unicorns to every impoverished child there is room for improvement.The biggest challenge in my experience has been balancing control and data collection with bureaucracy and intrusiveness. Collecting data and implementing controls can very easily become disruptive and detrimental to the process inadvertently.preventative maintenance occurs somewhere between every month and every year depending on the complexity and age of the system. I reckon it also depends on the budget of the maintenance crew.The law of diminishing returns remains largely true for a dollars to doughnuts look at process improvement. However alterations in how a process is performed similar to what an industrial engineer would do can save the company lots of money and improve efficiency at the cost of the time of performing the study and analyses. This is the trick of IEs everywhere.RFT right the first time is a metric you can use to track this.  operations generally target RFT of  of all jobs started and run as a minimum.

These get the flue gasses cold enough to condense the water out of it. These can approach the mid to high s in efficiency. Not much room for improvement left. Heat pumps  these have been improving as well. The somewhat recent advances were in compressor designs but now everyone is just trying to stay ahead of the refrigerant regulations that keep coming every few years. The efficiency of these systems improves with better heat sinksources like geothermal. At the end of the day there is not a whole lot of major gains in how we do heatingcooling. The biggest things come from good execution of systems.

Void form is basically just corrugated cardboard and is typically used where frost protection is not provided allowing some amount of heave to occur without affecting the structure. It is also used in the presence of expansive soils for similar reasons. Frost protected shallow foundations use rigid insulation to trap heat from the structure within the foundation envelope preventing the ground under the footings from freezing and possibly heaving. Placing void form under a footing assuming the footing is there to transmit loads from the structure to the ground would be a really bad idea because it has essentially no compressive strength.,engineering,d9h4e12,2,t5_2qhpi

I got roped into this company and one thing after another seemed to keep me here.  I went to school for a masters on their dime so I had to stay a couple years to make it up.  Then the recession hit so I stayed to weather it out.  Then I got a better job within the company so I stayed longer.

If you do an AutoCAD model for example of the electrical components and how they fit into the body I think youd be hardpressed to find any engineer that would see that as a waste of time. Hands on skills are always helpful as well. Obviously a civil project would be typically more applicable than a project like this... but if youre studying that fulltime and working on projects like that outside of school it may just burn you out. Plus you never know if youll stay civil. Myself and plenty of others went into fields quite different from what they studied in school because they found them more interesting as the years went on. You may find the same and this project in that case may be more related.

I would say that I prefer Solidworks as it stands. More intuitive assembly function is the main reason for me. A sincere annoyance with Inventor for me  is that the functionality while sketching like how pressing shift affects selecting with the cursor just for example is different from AutoCad. I use both and it can be tricky on days when I have to switch back and forth. As both these programs are from the same company this wasnt what I expected.So I would suggest you not make your choice based on the Autodesk brand. The behavior is different and it wont change the learning curve.,engineering,dc3ttdc,1,t5_2qhpi

This is the way they do things right or wrong and you are going to be looked at as someone who is trying to get off easy.At my first job everyone took an hour long lunch.  Who the hell needs an hour to eat I thought.  So i started taking  minutes and leaving at  instead of pm figuring it all added up to the same thing.  After  or  days of doing this I started to get some comments about leaving early and not putting in my time.It doesnt matter if you are still doing the same work if you are PERCEIVED to be a slacker or not carrying your weight then it will hurt you in the end.What I would recommend is perhaps looking into the possibility of working remotely  days per week.

10278762,0,t1_dc94mib,Well my main concern isnt money so much as quality of life. I make k now so Im doing fine for an engineer in their first job plus Im in an Atlanta suburb and not something nuts like San Francisco. I live in an isolated suburb and there isnt much here to do. Id like to see comedy shows or go see a basketball game and I cant do that where I live now as the drive downtown is an hour and thats before trying to find parking. The immediate area here just isnt that conducive to the life I want to be living and I dont feel this job is so necessary to me that I could do like an hour one way commute daily from the city itself to this job. So I figure I should just get a new job either here or elsewhere and try to locate myself so that Im comfortable with the commute and the cultural options available like sports or whatever.I am friendly with everyone here and I should stop by the lead to say hello since today is my first day back from vacation anyway. Maybe I can tease something out. Ill still give my resume and if they want to give me a raise Ill take it but I personally have no intention of staying a long time. I also dont want to alienate anyone while I job search and potentially would have to take days off for interviews as my desire for a new place is based on personal priorities rather than anything wrong with my current job or coworkers.,engineering,dc95jx0,1,t5_2qhpi

It may not be the master of the universe of engineering test but most people would agree someone that has passed the FE will probably be a better overall candidate than the one that has failed it and if nothing else shows youre putting in effort towards your career as opposed to just coasting on the fact that you got a bachelors degree.Whether or not you say something about a PE is up to the employment youre pursuing not all engineering jobs go toward a PE license.  People in very traditional engineering roles like construction and power plants tend to forget about the people in automotive aerospace product development etc. that are never professionally required to get a PE and in many cases doesnt really get you much compared to your past successful projects.  In fact Id advise being careful about mentioning a PE at all if youre in a nonPE related field as they may get the impression that your true desire is in another field and youll jump ship when an opportunity passes along.  Instead say you took the FE because you didnt know where the opportunities would be in the future and wanted to be ready to pursue a PE if the field called for it.  That way you show an initiative to appease the needs of the company and forward thinking which is really all an HR person is going to take away from it anyway academic engineering work may as well be Egyptian Hieroglyphics to an HR person in most cases.midpost edit I see now that youre a ChemE.

One clamp is fixed and other clamp attaches to the spring and you slowly pull on the spring. You could make a track with wood for the pulling side so that youre pulling straight. Know the FKx equation of the spring. You could test the spring with weights to derive the equation. For your test starts out by marking the location of the spring tip on the track. Pull on the spring slowly. Mark where on the track the tip of the spring is when the paper rips. Measure the two marks. Use FKx to find out how much force was on the paper when it ripped.

10828076,0,t3_5ur770,Sounds like total horseshit to me. Check out figure  on this page so we can have a common reference point when discussing the thermodynamic cycle in question. The heat exchanger component they propose ince thats what it is a heat exchanger between solar radiation and working fluid would be interposed at point  on the cycle shown in the diagram which is outlet of compressorinlet to condenser. The component is isobaric its a heat exchanger tube so ideally theres no pressure drop across it and any pressure drop is just lost efficiency. So well be following an isobar on the Th diagram for this process of heat addition. Conveniently the isobar in question is already plotted on the diagram Ph the compressor outlet pressure.So what does this heat exchanger do? It walks the fluid up the isobar from point  towards the end of the line drawn. Were then left with a fluid on the exact same isobar we started on but hotter and with more enthalpy.All this does is force the condenser to deal with a higher level of superheat. Looking at figure  the Ph diagram we can see that this is just an extended desuperheating process. The desuperheat requires condenser area and ambient heat exchange to reject heat to ambient. So to keep the rest of the cycle operating on the same curves wed need a bigger condenser to reject more heat but we would have failed to displace the operating curve to a different isobar and so wed end up with the rest of the cycle operating exactly as it did before.The company seems to be proposing that taking a refridgerant vapor heating it up and then cooling it down again all in the superheat region and all between the compresser and the condensing region of the condenser can somehow improve cycle efficiency. Theres not a clear reason why this would be so and absent any substantial technical claims on the website my bullshit meter is off the high end of the scale.,engineering,ddwu8e1,3,t5_2qhpi

10907045,0,t3_5vti7v,gtthere were three other more senior engineers above me who checked my theory but did not scrutinize my numbers. So if this happened in my field Nuclear Power we would be doing some level of causal evaluation to figure out what broke down and why it happened. It sounds to me like your process failed. Your reviewers did not give it the level they probably should have. Remember all events have multiple barriers in place to protect them. You making a mistake and not catchingcorrecting it at the start with is only one barrier. The bigger issue is why did it get past the three others? Was the right level of review in place? Did they meet their commitments and the requirements for doing an independent technical review? The other thing to consider.....if your calculation was wrong and the part would have failed did you have a barrier in place that could have caught it? Like comprehensive testing? In that case this is limited to just a design analysis error and couldnt have progressed to a fieldparts issue.I wouldnt feel bad. But you should make a learningdevelopment opportunity out of it. Obviously dont try to hide it. But you should probably tell your boss about this. They may want to have a discussion or put out a statement about independent technical reviews because its obvious some barrier got missed. Ive been in this position before. Both in engineering and recently in operations when I allowed an operator from the Fix It Now team to hang a clearance order lockouttagout order that nearly led to me ordering a reactor scram. I was one barrier of many that broke down in the process of developing that clearance order going to the field. We managed to correct the issue and stabilize the plant but we were down to our last barrier which was the human actions of us operators not a place you want to be. I felt awful about the whole thing when it happened. If only I had asked one more level of questions or gone a little bit deeper or whatever. But what we determined is that the whole process broke down and we determined that we need an additional barrier in place when the normal FIN supervisor is out on vacation.Take it as a learningdevelopment opportunity.gt I feel like I fd up and dont deserve the promotion I got after my performance review.Us engineers are very critical of ourselves. Our work is important and can have high risks associated with it whether its public safety or profitability for a company. We are more likely to be caught by imposter syndrome or one of the other ideas that people who are smarter tend to think less of their technical capabilities because they are more capable of recognizing their shortfalls.

11052381,0,t1_dej8437,gt Protip Youre not in school anymore. Books are no longer your main resource.False.  YOU may not see a need books in your career but many practicing engineers routinely reference books.Yes I know you referred to them as a main resource but they make good fundamental starting points when investigating something or trying to find justification for some intuition you may have on a situation.  Taking books at facevalue is not the way to use them though.  A wellwritten reference will have several pages of bibliographical information.  Those references in addition to the one you just read plus additional works citing the book you just read are all useful in synthesizing an approach to a problem.As an RampD engineer Ive got everything from NFPA  to DO and DO books covering the physical process of PCB construction electromagnetic testing solid state motor control DSP and RF design and just about anything else that Ive needed a good reference for.  I rarely pull them off the shelf but when I do they are absolutely required.I still fail to see where any practicing engineer can make a flatout claim that they have absolutely zero need for hardcopy reference material.,engineering,dekro73,1,t5_2qhpi

Siemens S can be set up as either servo or VFD drives using the same hardware which is great. If you buy all the licensing for the control units you can program them to do anything. The caveat is that its extremely complicated to set them up to do exactly what you have to do and you end up doing a lot of programming in the drive control units yourself.

Now go back to the script and using whatever you need to get to the same answer. This will inevitably teach you programming logic and you will become very efficient analyst in MATLAB. You will also find MATLAB functions  to do a lot of what you need and as you go through your advanced mathematics classes you should now have the skills needed to craft your own unique functions to do the heavy lifting.

For example using the Taguchi method in my statistics class we used a program called Minitab to run experiments. Basically these methods narrow down statistically significant factors so you can begin to design around those and find the optimal outcome. As a simplified example we did an analysis of popping popcorn as a simple homework assignment to become familiar with it. The inputs were amount of oil amount of kernels type of popcorn microwave power time being cooked etc. After all the factors were put in to the analysis we used the Taguchi method to basically narrow down to the only statistically significant factors.,engineering,df2fl22,2,t5_2qhpi

11310062,0,t3_61dpt0,You seem to be mistaken on your knowledge of the rules. There is no six second rule for the MGUK it is limited by MJ of harvest per lap as shown in the diagram in the other reply. This now swings the question in the other direction if it can only harvest MJ per lap how can it deploy MJ? The answer to this is the MGUH. This motor harvests energy from the exhaust gases charging the batteries allowing the MGUK to deploy at optimum times. Energy usage strategies are quite interesting as there is both a total and instantaneous power limit in Formula  kg of fuel per race and kghr max fuel flow limit respectively so the two have to be traded off each other. Add onto this the fact that circuits have different lap lengths which means shorter circuits will result in a higher average power transfer per lap. Edit to add I believe the  second figure may have been from the old regulations when Formula  had KERS. Also if you feel so inclined the Formula  technical regulations are publically available here ,engineering,dfdz875,2,t5_2qhpi

11398368,0,t1_dfmfw0h,You will find that this is not a simple question to answer. Start looking into geometric dimensions and tolerances. With D printing material is always an estimated shape depending on how your printer times steps and the size of the step relative to the geometry. Basically you can never have a round circle or a flat slot but there are measuring techniques you can learn to find deficiencies in a part. For example most holes made by machining are elliptical or triangular this means that an under sized part isnt necessarily undersized in all directions. By measuring in multiple directions you can get a minimum theoretical diameter that fits inside your hole. The opposite is true for a shaft to find the theoretical minimum diameter that it can fit inside because its not actually round either. You can then match your theoretical diameters to the capability of your d printer to get your best possible fits.,engineering,dfnznv5,1,t5_2qhpi

I agree with your position but our opinion is in contradiction to the current law in most places. ,engineering,dgqpwtl,21,t5_2qhpi

11747482,0,t1_dgrkfum,Perhaps not but it doesnt matter.  The government doesnt get to prevent people from talking about something without an imprimatur.They can and do require that someone with a proper license signs off on something before its built or opened to the public.  And theyre free to ignore the opinions of people without that license.  But they cant control what those people say.,engineering,dgrlugo,7,t5_2qhpi
11753558,0,t1_dgria1y,Its generally way different in the US. It is much harder to get a US P.E. cert. You have to work under one for  years. But there are less of them so most engineers never work for a PE. The US does not recognize the Canadian licences due mostly to the difference in standards. PEs in the US only stamp government projects. The rest of us arent unwashed scum we can do our jobs perfectly fine and understand Engineering fundamentals better than some PEs.,engineering,dgsan2d,4,t5_2qhpi

The torque from a Dremel is not that high but the operator can inadvertently put a very high bending moment on the shaft especially if the cutting wheel starts to chatter. ,engineering,dgwrxrk,11,t5_2qhpi

11808283,0,t1_dgyi0qk,Chiropractors call themselves doctor.  I dont think they should be sanctioned for it.  I just think it makes them look stupid.The standard I choose for selecting medical services isnt whether or not they call themselves doctor.  Its whether or not theyve been issued a license and completed a proper education amongst other things.,engineering,dgyid4q,2,t5_2qhpi
