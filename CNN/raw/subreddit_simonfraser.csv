11099471,0,t1_deq3e8l,It isnt really a term paper per se but two of the  assignments require writing of which one is a multi question writing assignment that required a short paper at the end. The other is a reflection piece. The optional group project also requires a reflection piece. So if you dont mine short papers ish words you should be fine.,simonfraser,deq4619,2,t5_2rlf7

11491555,0,t3_6416aw,Ive been on the meal plan for most semesters since Ive enrolled and its good for what it is. The value really depends on how many times you go if you have three meals or more per day then it pays for itself easily. The food is pretty good in my opinion and they switch it up enough that I personally dont tend to get sick of it.    I personally dont grocery shop because I am on the meal plan but if you want to then its ideal to have a car which is a huge expense on its own if you want to park up here. The only grocery store on campus Nesters Market is overpriced so youll want to go off campus to go shopping which is a bit of a pain in itself if you have to take the bus. I believe theres a free shuttle for residents that goes to one of the offcampus grocery stores every couple weeks I forget which one but Ive never taken it myself.,simonfraser,dfykeol,5,t5_2rlf7
