10068541,0,t1_dbjxqf1,Nobody wants to do that pasting hereWe had a customer earlier today who complained about his room so we moved him to a different room. This is a common occurrence normally it happens because of poor WiFi reception in some rooms so we didnt think much of it. Well the guy failed to take everything of his to his new room namely his girlfriend who he left in the old room. I was not made aware of this until I did my rounds and checked in on the room  we always do this after a person switches rooms to make sure the room is fit to rent. But its our slow season so everything follows a leisurely pace  which is a fancy way of saying I couldnt be bothered to check it any quicker because I didnt really care enough to... Anyways I opened the door and this lady is standing there  butt naked screaming at me. So I panic and quickly  managing to get out a meek Sorry Im the manager! Then I realize that this room should be empty. So I knock on the door again. After a few minutes she opens the door and starts to go absolutely apeshit on me. She goes on to say how she is in fear of her life and that I am a rapist. Now that last part strikes me a bit weird this is not the only time this has happened  this has happened four times under different circumstances since Ive started working here fears of rape were cited before and I dont exactly blame them for feeling threatened by me opening a door unexpectedly  Im a big guy some people get scared when they see me unexpectedly... What struck me as odd here though was she was stated it very matteroffactly not with any emotion. And then comes the big reveal she points to a video camera in the corner. She says she was recording when I burst into the room and shes going to show the video to the police and claim that I raped her. Logically this makes no sense  but I wasnt thinking that at the time. Obviously I didnt rape her we didnt have sex a recording wouldnt mean a damn thing unless it was altered heavily and she didnt know this but I am the absolutely most flaming of homosexuals. So I panic a bit and she adds to her rant We can just avoid all of this if you give me . And now the panic drains from me. This isnt some crazy lady who Ive scared shes just a bitch who wants money. I dont have . Which is true I fucking dont have . She replies Well we have a problem then. So I go back to the office luckily I know better than to say anything beyond this point  although the true lunacy of what she was doing hadnt dawned on me yet. In the office I call the nonemergency line for the police and tell them I need an officer for an issue with a customer. Ive got good rapport with dispatch since Ive had to call them fairly often over the years so they sent an officer straight over. As Im waiting for the officer it starts to hit me how ridiculous this whole situation is. Is this lady just crazy? But theres still that bit of panic because ultimately the truth doesnt matter as much as the officers interpretation of the situation and then all the Hollywood style revenge scenarios of cop showing up  who thinks I kinda look like the guy who killed his whole family in the s sparking him to pursue a career in law enforcement to find his familys killer. I imagine him seeing the situation dragging me off behind the building and shooting me in the head. And here I am in the dark place of my brain wrecked with anxiety and near tears when the officer shows up. The buzzer rings to the office. The cop is standing outside its a woman. A new Hollywood scenario runs through my head of a sextrafficked avenger lady cop  out to stick it to the menfolk who done her wrong. More anxiety... I buzz her in and explain the situation as it happened  including the camera the demand for  and the rape allegation. She says Ok well lets go talk to the lady lead the way. Im walking in front of her now Hollywood scenarios are still very active in my brain  despite her seeming completely calm and reasonable. We get to the room and the lady says I raped her shes in fucking tears while shes saying it  running mascara and puffy eyes. Oh fuck my brain says Youre SO gonna die! Anxiety is just climbing higher and higher doing quick breathing exercises realizing it makes me look absolutely guilty . Then she gets to the video camera. The cop immediately asks You have a recording may I see it? She shows the cop the recording of me opening the door and her screaming but doesnt pause the video after it. Before she realizes this the cop has taken the camera out of her hands pulled the camera out of the ladys reach and is watching as the recording continued. Including the part where she presumably got dressed opened the door and proceeded to extort me. Lady cop has this look on her face the Are you fucking kidding me? look... after a minute she makes this point clear by actually saying Are you fucking kidding me? Bitchlady has no more tears just a shocked look on her face and she realizes that mistakes have been made. Miranda rights followed the lady was arrested for extortion. We tried to talk to her boyfriend but he was not in the room he was supposed to move in to My guess is that he got a general idea of the crazy he was dealing with and bolted Lady cop is my new hero admittedly because she didnt go all Kill Bill vol.  on me. After a quick google search on the penal code shes likely going to face  years in prison... so thats nice. After a few cigarettes Ive calmed down and am ready to finish out with doubleshift with optimism. Tomorrow will be a better day or there will be another anxiety attack who knows? TLDR OPs gone  days without anxiety meds gets falsely accused of rape and it all works out.,dealwithit,dbjycgk,5,t5_2se9q
