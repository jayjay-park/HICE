3607307,0,t3_31lcvx,Sorry if think this is a little inappropriate but what about the thinks that are missing?Personally I think not having a shot just showing the persons hands doing a task thinking of the whole satellite business and not showing the character with sweat pouring off of them . I know these are two tiny things but I think they really help to make the characters real!!!,Thunderbirds,cq3gja0,2,t5_2sw86
3609678,0,t1_cq3nx5z,I dont think they have ever said Jeff was dead just missing. ,Thunderbirds,cq3qa17,2,t5_2sw86
3721924,0,t1_cqgeb81,Thatd be hilarious if they brought him back. Gosh that scene in the movie was so strange. It would be fun to see some remakes and would certainly help the writers fill that ? episode quota. ,Thunderbirds,cqgixlp,1,t5_2sw86
3723311,0,t1_cqgnumh,Most of the machines are indeed CGI  the Thunderbirds and a lot of the hero guest vehicles are. The Hoods ship is a physical model as are some background vehicles in next weeks episode.I seem to recall reading that Weta painted onto the digital models so the CGI textures match those they would have if they were physical models helping to tie the two together visually.,Thunderbirds,cqgom7e,3,t5_2sw86
3734646,0,t1_cqhwd94,It was already cannon that thunderbird  could recognize help and rescue on any frequency in any language and if nessisary would translate the messages in real time. Finding the origin and doing a database search to find the local emergency services is well within that level of computing power.,Thunderbirds,cqhz31x,1,t5_2sw86
3770263,0,t3_33g20c,As a fan of the old show I need to ask some things though I realise this may not be the thread for it. I havnt seen any episodes besides the into which looks great. I noticed that Thunderbird S looks a lot like the Spectrum Angels ships which makes me think Does this show contain references to other Gerry Anderson cartoons like Stingray or Captian Scarlet?. This show is set in  right? I saw a clip saying there was a war in the s. . Is Jeff Tracy in it? Ive seen nothing from him. ,Thunderbirds,cqm1d3k,1,t5_2sw86
3860998,0,t1_cqwdlzm,Oh agreed that it is great for all the family.I think that someone in ITV will be keeping a note on the use of their sites and I think they will notice a large proportion of the people who see this are watching online and may decide to move it.,Thunderbirds,cqwdzl7,1,t5_2sw86
4003964,0,t1_crccs61,Well said. It was kind of narrow minded of me to assume. I suppose its in how people are raised. I assume your parents were into thunderbirds? I think the major appeal to me is that it reminds me of being a young boy watching them with my dad who grew up with them himself. I think I still have every episode he recorded on vcr somewhere. ,Thunderbirds,crcolrf,1,t5_2sw86
5508102,0,t3_3qidku,Its really awesome that they still use physical models. Sort of in keeping with the original show.,Thunderbirds,cwfpl6e,3,t5_2sw86
