8049705,0,t3_4ph7km,Im finishing out my basement and took the time to run  cat cables to each room in the house and set up a small data center under the stairs in the basement. This is my current layout and I was wondering if theres anything that I could simplify or improve. Ive been having issues with my Asus router and was thinking about replacing it with a mounted router since I dont need the wireless functionality downstairs. Thoughts or suggestions?,Network,d4kv1yb,1,t5_2qthw
8292924,0,t3_4697sp,QinQ is awesome and an under used protocol but I would recommend using routed interfaces at each location.  The L connection across VLAN  should be used as direct connections for an L routing protocol.  If you have a few sites OSPF is easy and reliable.  This will allow you to isolate each site.  Create your VLANs and nonoverlapping IP ranges establish your L connections across the WAN and turn on OSPF.,Network,d5e6au9,1,t5_2qthw
