5053041,0,t1_cuusknr,This is right off of El Camino across from the Rite Aid Big O Tires and the Chase Bank right infront of both Max Berg Park and Las Palmas Elementary. This is the first time Ive seen or heard of any of this happening though! A lot of crazy shit has been happening in the Beach Cities area lately though it seems a CVS got robbed in town today I think the one off of El Camino but not for sure and there was a stabbing a little ways out of Dana Point this weekend ,SanClemente,cuv3020,2,t5_2syqx
