4575579,0,t3_3c0yua,Thanks for this. Thought it was a great interpretation! I really like how you made the connection between LIFE and all its unexpected changes and turns as being the HOUSE! Such an incredible analogy and I feel stupid for not seeing it now! haha The Johnny and Zampano plot still confuses me a bit but I have only read this book once  certainly one that takes several goes! Thanks again for sharing woman!,houseofleaves,ct7cykm,1,t5_2tgm7

If Johnny wanders off into a meandering description of his father flying through the clouds you will still be able to enjoy the rest of the book if you miss it out for now. If the footnotes are slowing you down skip those too. You can always come back. I find it hard to read like this too I want to understand it all. But some fiction is hardest to read in that way. MZD creates works of aesthetics where feeling and tone are as important as details. Much of HoL is supposed to feel disorientating even frustrating. It is a maze after all. And as Zampano himself tells us mazes seem their most complicated when viewed from within.,houseofleaves,de2jbdg,10,t5_2tgm7
11579189,0,t3_655ah9,rTheFamiliar    But if your not up for another MZD book try basically everything ever written by Borges as well as Godel Esther Bach an eternal golden braid.   Slade House and The Bone Clock are both good places to go. As is most stuff by Pynchon or The Illuminatus trilogy.         But The familiar Only Revolutions and The fifty year sword are the best places to go to better understand HOL with one exception.   Clip This short story might entirely reframe how you interpret HOL and if it doesnt its pretty good on its own.,houseofleaves,dg8ia6e,6,t5_2tgm7
