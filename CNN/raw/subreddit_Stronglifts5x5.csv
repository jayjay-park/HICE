But youll likely also hit your strength limits quicker and at a lower level.That said  SLx isnt a no cardio program. Not necessary but not verboten.

2003710,0,t3_2hoqmq,Youre a mess.  But thats okay.  Check out this post Watch all those videos and then watch them again and then a few more times.  uctaatgt tips are amazing.  Make a checklist for each exercise and make sure you are setting up properly every time.  You start with the bar to perfect your form so you dont hurt yourself later on.  Realize that you have muscles in your rearend and in the back of your legs.  You need to train yourself to turn these on.  If youve been sitting for most of your life it will take time to learn how to wake them up.  When you are squatting and deadlifting your butt and hamstrings need to be engaged.  If you are pulling and those musclses arent firing you are doing it incorrectly and risk punishing your poor lower back.  Your deadlift video is the prime example.  You lifted all that weight with your lower back and an unstabilized spine instead of using the hip hinge.  The backs of your legs should be doing the work here.  When you are rowing your legs should be screwed into the ground with your glutes and hamstrings taut and your abs tight so that your spine stays straight and supported and the weight is pulled by your mid and upper back not your poor poor lower back.  Google posterior chain activation tips.Google Kelly Starretts Bracing Sequence.  Practice this all the time  In the bank at work when youre waiting for the bus.  It will make you a beast and fix your posture too.  Also start thinking about where your shoulders are and practice sucking them back into the sockets where they belong.  Do this all the time.Then Youtube Kelly Starretts MWOD.  Do everything he tells you to when something hurts or doesnt seem to move like it should.  Make this a rest day habit.  Realize that you dont just have to build muscle but undue all the years of damage youve done to your body from sitting in chairs etc.  Also realize that this damage is not irreparable and is something that you can repair with patience and determination.None of these exercises should generate pain or tightness in the lower back.  If it does then you know your form is bad.  Stop and fix your form.  Do not try to push passed this and end up hurt instead stop and fix your form.  This is not a race.  Do it correctly first.Your squat video wouldnt play for me so Ill just make some blanket assumptions.If your ankle mobility is as bad as mine get some lifting shoes and try raising your heels.  Do you need this?  Heres a good test. Try to squat with just bodyweight.   Check out  of this video This is what a squat should be.  Can you do this? Remember tight stomach shoulders sucked back shove your butt back first then break at the knees and keep your chest up.  If you cant squat passed parallel and stay there without coming off your heels and falling forward or if your chest dips you have a mobility problem and will destroy your back.  I have a mobility problem and compensate with raised heels.  For me it is the difference between great form and lumbar destruction.  Try it.  Also watch that whole video because its fucking great and also do all those things.Above all remember You have already done the hardest part youve decided to take control of your life and committed to doing the work.  Now just take the time to lay the foundation of good form mobility and patience and you are guaranteed great results.Feel free to message me.,Stronglifts5x5,ckun932,11,t5_2x8is

3983126,0,t3_362bgq,I think everyone else has covered your squat. One thing Ill say about your OHP is your definitely going to need to use a rack once the weight gets heavier. Also as you push the weight up remember to push your head through the window. This will engage the lats and traps and make the weight much more stable at the top position. Take a look at this how to video by Omar IsufDeadlift is almost there. I just think you need to break the bar which will engage your lats and make sure that your upper back is straight.

It is a positive as it will slow down the weight increase especially important for OHP. Basically when you start a new weight think I have got  attempts to get this lift spot on. If your not happy with your form give it another shot next time. Dont be afraid to use all  attempts until your really happy with the lift it will help you avoid  fails and then a forced deload further up the road. ,Stronglifts5x5,cuvs3rc,1,t5_2x8is

Currently powering through weights I was failing on before.  So i think over all it was a blessing in disguise as it forced me to do the long deload.if you can handle squats at all id do whatever weight you can comfortably handle without causing any pain. even if its just body weight air squats.also try calf raises and see if theres a deadlift style that doesnt cause any pain. good mornings? romanian? sumo?i am not a doctor or a trainer but id say bottom line is dont do anything to make it worse.

5453572,0,t3_3pn8je,I started out on SLx and switched to SS after a month or so. My wife did SL for longer before I convinced her to switch to SS as well. Im about . months into lifting so thats about  months on SS Im probably about . months away from my LP in my estimation but could be shorter who knows I am not a genetic freak.There are a few differences as others have pointed out. SLx will have you do Barbell Rows SS will have you do Power Cleans. SL is a x program SS is a x program.As others have said Power Cleans are really technical and take time to learn and Rippetoe doesnt even want you doing them for at least a month into the program so you can focus on learning and mastering the other lifts first.Difference  is the big one. People often fail to realize the impact of  extra work sets have on you. Thats a lot of volume and it will slow your recovery down a lot earlier than you would otherwise experience on a x program. Here are some quick numbers to illustrate my point. Lets say your get your squat up to  reps   lbs. Each set is  lbs of volume being moved by your body. On a x program your squat workout is  lbs of weight being moved  warmups on a x program your squat workout is  lbs of weight being moved  warmups. Thats no small difference boys and girls.I have started to recommend both programs depending on the desirepersonality type of the person Im talking to If you just want to get in shape arent overly concerned with getting as strong as possible in a month period then by all means do SLx. The increased volume will help you lose body fat with an appropriate diet build some more visible muscle etc. On SLx you are pretty much guaranteed to plateau on lifts sooner and have to spend time deloading to deal with it will plateau sooner due to the increased volume each workout unless you are genetic freak or were previously strong. This is not a problem if you are just trying to get in shape and get stronger generally. If you are particularly interested in getting stronger as I am and doing it as fast as possible SS will likely be better for you. Youll be able to carry your linear progression the ability to add more weight to the bar every single workout farther since the volume will be lower than a x workout. Of course all this is dependent upon you eating properly while on SS the same goes for SLx but Rippetoe is more vocal about eating appropriately to sustain your novice linear progression.With respect to the Power Cleans on SS it should be noted that the express purpose of doing Power Cleans is to help train power moving something quickly as opposed to raw force production. Plenty of people do SS and substitute regular chinups or some other ancilliary exercise in their place. Please dont let PCs discourage you from experiencing SS if you arent interested in Power Cleans. The strength gains that are possible in a relatively short period of time on a welldesigned x program are exhilarating and exciting.,Stronglifts5x5,cw8qv31,1,t5_2x8is

6789115,0,t3_48ptwc,Hey Im in a similar boat. I dont know the precise answer. But Ive often wondered the same thing. If youre interested this is what Ive been doing and the positive results Ive had. So Im afraid its just another varied answer.Ive been doing the programme for about five months now. Ive been tracking my food with MFP and my activity with a Fitbit heart rate thing. The Fitbit is connected to MFP and tells it that Ive burnt X number of calories from my workouts and stuff I do during the day. So most days I have a few extra calories. I ignore this.My MFP settings are set to maintain weight and that Im sedentary. Which is mostly true. On workout days I eat a bit more than what MFP tells me to. On other days I eat a bit less. In my case this is never less than  calories.Ive been losing kglbs a week.Ive battled with weight loss for most of my life and its been a mental hurdle to allow myself to eat more than I usually would while trying to lose weight. But I decided to give it a go for a few months. Ive been pleasantly surprised. I didnt believe it would work for me. But it did.So my advice  based entirely on my own experience and anecdotal evidence from the Internet  is eat at maintenance. Make sure its good food. Ignore the calories burnt from your workouts. If you start to stall with your lifting eat a bit more. More strength is more muscle. More muscle means youll burn more calories just by being alive.Also if youre not already measure your body. I measure myself once a month. Its boring but its worth it. Over Christmas and New Year I ate loads. Stopped working out. Didnt measure or weigh myself throughout late December and January. When I finally got on the scale at the end of January after getting back on the wagon for a week Id gained a few kg. Felt a bit down. Then I measured myself. Id lost about cm since November and gained cm on my chest! Remember. The scale isnt everything.,Stronglifts5x5,d0lu1pb,5,t5_2x8is

Learning to fail is important so you dont fear it do this early and practice with empty bars.  This means using a power rack for squats and bench lots of detail on SL.com  Use mirrors when possible or ask someone more advanced for corrections.  Unless you have a significant injury or physical issue you should be alright at these weights.However more info is needed ageweightgenderinjuries?  Definitely keep up with planks the harder they are the more youre getting out of them.  It would never hurt to ask a doctor or trainer if thats possible.

7779201,0,t3_4lvb5a,Its hard to say if SL will work for you  youll just have to try it to see. I like it because I didnt know anything about barbells so having a well structured program helps put the learning experience on rails and allows me to focus on doing the work. The app is what its all about for me  I like the rest timer and the semiautomated progression. If you pay for it it includes accessory exercises and things that make it easier like a breakdown of what plates to use for a given weight.Ive always liked pullups so Ive added them. The progression in the app is really nice for weighted pullups. I also add planks and Im starting to add dips because my upper body needs work. Dont worry about what exercises to add for your belly  you cant spot reduce fat. Calories in calories out is pretty much the only way to losegain. Add accessories in to break through plateaus and shore up weaknesses.In terms of supplements I dont take any. But I do recommend tracking your protein at least tracking your calories is a good idea too but not entirely necessary depending on your goals. Before I tracked my protein and calories I wasnt getting nearly enough of either  tracking helped make sure I was on the right track.In terms of cardio I train for boxing outside of SL and I can tell you that it is getting more difficult now that the weights getting heavier. But if you arent doing something as intense as that you should be just fine going for a while.One thing Id recommend is not starting the weights too high even though you have some experience. Let it be light and practice the movements  trust me it will get heavy soon enough.Good luck!,Stronglifts5x5,d3qfir7,3,t5_2x8is

9674483,0,t1_da5khmq,gt Meaning that youll gain fat more easily than a similar person with less fat cells as its easier for your body to replenish an existing fat cell than it is for your body to create new ones.This is simply not true. If you do not overeat you will not gain body fat  regardless of how many fat cells you have or how fat you have been in the past. You would need to overeat a huge amount and fill every fat cell to capacity before you created new ones and you can prevent that by simply watching your diet.I agree that GOMAD is hugely excessive for a novice lifter its a relic from the days before precision nutrition and really has very little place in todays world of MFP. How much weight did you actually gain? Because if it was less than  lbs I can almost guarantee that you didnt create any new fat cells anyway. Here from wikigtAn average human adult has  billion fat cells with a weight of  lbs or . kg. If excess weight is gained as an adult fat cells increase in size about fourfold before dividing and increasing the absolute number of fat cells present.That means that an average adult can gain about  lbs before their existing fat cells are full to capacity. Did you gain  lbs? If not you have nothing to worry about. I did and then some and I still dont worry about gaining fat easier in future because fat gain is  determined by calorie intake and not by total fat cells.So chillax and just dont do a dirty bulk again !,Stronglifts5x5,da5kzy5,3,t5_2x8is

11378054,0,t3_62a2eg,I do yoga! In my opinion flexibility is really important for weightlifting. I do a yoga style that is really chill like yin or hatha. You can do some more active ones like vinyasa that include balances and sun salutations. But I would stay away from anything like power yoga forrest yoga or anything that also introduces any pilatesstyle movements. I tried that once and my muscles were far too fatigued to do anything well the next day. It was a very frustrating lifting day.I find I really benefit from a healthy mix of poses for flexibility and poses for balance and a tiny heart beat increase. I start more active at the beginning of the week with balances and a fast paced flow from one pose to the next. I end the week with a yin yoga class thats super restorative and focuses on passive flexibility. I also usually take a leisurely walk before or after my yoga practice.here is a super chill yin yoga classhere is a rather fastpaced vinyasa class with lots of balance poses,Stronglifts5x5,dflom3v,2,t5_2x8is
