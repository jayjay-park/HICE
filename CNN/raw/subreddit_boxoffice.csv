A beloved name brand starring the hottest male lead on the planet. The balls on Universal to greenlight that. I am sure the stock took a big hit when that was announced.              Yes Affleck won on Oscar for The Town. Yes The Wachowskis were hot off Cloud Atlas. You know that big box office smash. Throwing M at Furious  isnt a risk it is the obvious decision. Just like no one is surprised they are making an th installment without Paul Walker.

If youre talking about what F will gross overall that is pretty much already roughly determined by its opening weekend and the range is sharpened by the nd weekend drop. The fact that it happens to be close to numbers from another movie is coincidental. In other words F is going to follow a similar revenue path because both movies were not well received but were high profile enough to draw what they did. F is not going to earn what it does because of Total Recall. Note this is all referencing domestic only. Differences in distribution overseas is another matter.,boxoffice,cu6qjo4,-2,t5_2r1ky

Instead of innovating and providing experiences that will keep people away from watching movies online they treat it as an enemy combatant scold any effort to embrace the future look at how they reacted to Netflix picking up Crouching Tiger  and raise their prices as patchwork for a failing business model. The people who are going to be lazy and cheap are going to be lazy and cheap hence why Game of Thrones and House of Cards remain two of the top most torrented shows despite how easy it is the access them legally. The theaters exacerbate that by almost actively discouraging people from seeing movies at their establishments holding studios back from doing anything meaningful with this great tool. Lowmidbudget movies really dont have an excuse to be made available for cheap online I think there would be a good market for that if handled correctly. Tentpoles are still there for big theaters and if the experience is good people will seek out the theater experience anyway.

I was surprised really World War Z turned out alright considering it was heavenly deviating away from the source material which is very very different to the movie.

Said one rival major studio marketing chief When it comes to the opening of Star Wars Force Awakens there isnt an opening that would surprise me. You could put a  a  or a  in front of it. Nothing would shock me.gtIn fact the B.O. projection math per one exhibitor that gets us to a near M opening goes as follows  auditoriums X  seats X  ticket X  shows a day X a  occupancy.M. Since Force Awakens has a running time of  hours and  minutes exhibitors will be able to show the film as much as  times a day on  screens. While thats a normal number of showtimes for any city multiplex sources believe that even suburban venues will pump up their showtimes for this movie beyond their typical norms. Force Awakens comes on the tracking boards next week so well have a more grounded estimate. But as we saw with Jurassic World this summer when youre dealing with a film thats tracking off the charts it becomes a challenging projection given the statistical sampling size.

6055882,0,t3_3ygeq3,Theres a flaw with your math  Youre ignoring what already happened.  Youre running projections based on the nd weekend numbers only to give an estimate of eventual overall gross.  The overall gross includes the first week so a part of what youre doing is estimating the first week using the second weekend.  Thats a bit useless since we have actual first week data.  Lets use all our dataMovie | First  days | nd weekend | remainder|||Jurassic World | . | . | .Avengers | . | . | .Age of Ultron | . | . | .Avatar | . | . | .Star Wars | . | . | ???From here we see that Avengers and Jurassic World did .x and .x their second weekends for the remainder of their run.  Giving a .x to Star Wars would indicate .M from here on out for a total of M.Why does that differ from your M number?  Because you also implicitly tried to estimate the first week and the first week of Star Wars is actually lower than youd think based on the second weekend.  That sentence probably seems strange to read.  Its really just another way of saying that Star Wars has had good holds.Further after next weekend Star Wars has to deal with January weekdays which will hinder its progress relative to a summer blockbuster.

7088889,0,t1_d1jvec4,Again I havent read the event comic and from the reviews the series was received with lukewarm responses overall. But I think the lack of scale is going to be detrimental. Marvel is probably hating themselves for having to sell off a bunch of their properties to different studios in order to stay solvent as a company because I think they would love to be able to use the Xmen the Fantastic Four to tell this huge event that I think you cant really do justice with this five on five dispute. It will be interesting to see how the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige try to compensate for the depth of people involved. To their credit the Marvel films have remained consistent with their properties. Some of their films have been great such as Iron Man  GotG Thor and the first Captain America to some pretty awfully mediocre films like The Dark World  Hulk and the Iron Man sequels and AoU. For better or for worse Feige has steered the MCU into becoming this moneyprinting machine due to his ironfisted will and unyielding power. ,boxoffice,d1jw6nt,0,t5_2r1ky

Also Deadpool would have to be a quality movie to make money because hes a lesser known property. This is why his success is not a counter example to my thesis  for highly recognized properties like Batman or Superman you dont need to have a quality movie to be financially successful.

It had a cinema score of A but it had only a multiple of .. So in that sense it negatively defied expectations and underperformed at the domestic box office with quite a big departure from the expected multiple when you look at the cinema score.

I love to see the numbers but my guess is that a larger percentage of movie tickets are being sold year over year. So theoretically a movie would be selling fewer tickets overall but if a larger percentage of them are being purchased via Fandango then it could be outselling a more popular movie from a few years ago.Really the only news that is really going to matter is if a giant tentpole doesnt outsell comparable movies.

Both of FampF and Transformers have been brand in China for decade while Star Wars dates back to  years ago and has outdated VFX and the most important is scifi. Compared to fantasy or action scifi is a way less popular genre in China.So maybe Star Wars can be the second Transformersthat sounds weird in China if they market the movie to kids successfully like ueescorpius said.

7536233,0,t1_d2xj7eg,i think the issue with hunger games and hobbit was that the concluding films where a disappointment to the audience. Many people who enjoyed the first  hunger games films didnt find mockingjay as good it seems to be the same way for the books. The hobbit trilogy overall was not as good as the original lord of the rings trilogy. The decline in quality seems to impact their reduction in box office success. Harry potter and LOTR on the other hand finished on very high notes with deathly hallows part  and return of the king. i also took a look at twilight breaking dawn since that was also a part . While the series isnt exactly acclaimed by the general audience breaking dawn part  was comparatively seen one of the better films in that series and ended up being the highest grossing film of the series worldwide. Thus as long as the concluding films are not seen as disappointments by those who have seen the previous works in a film series there is a good chance it will be just as successful as it processors. if the final film is a disappointing even to the diehard fans of the series it will see likely see decline in revenue. ,boxoffice,d2ytzwp,2,t5_2r1ky

If you look at a lot of movies the average scores are the same on MC as they are on RT but RTs main metric is binary good or bad to come out to a general consensus.  on RT doesnt mean that the movie is a  it means that  of people liked it and  didnt. So its almost like saying you have a  chance of liking a movie. Metacritic just tells you what an elite group of people thought of a movie on average. Your best bet is to identify individual reviewers whose tastes are similar to yours I find. ,boxoffice,d3jbxq3,6,t5_2r1ky

Also I get that DC is going for a more gritty realistic world than Marvel but does the entire movie have to be gray? And what was with the music? It was like someone got a playlist of classic rock songs and hit next every  seconds. The racial stereotypes with Killer Croc and El Diablo were also hilariously bad.

For one it comes out two weeks after Thor Ragnarok which if it features Hulk could be massive and just three weeks before Star Wars giving it maybe two weeks at the most to make any money before its completely swept away.

10647265,0,t1_dddb57g,This argument really does not hold good. Just because a character is more popular does not translate to good box office results. Take Fantastic Beasts for example. It has made  million dollars so far outgrossing Suicide Squad Deadpool Doctor Strange and others. Does this mean Eddie Redmayne or Newt Scamander is more popular? Absolutely not. The movie did well because of the Rowling brand.Similarly Doctor Strange did well because of the power of the Marvel Brand. Nobody even went to theatres thinking it is a Doctor Strange movie. Everyone went thinking Another marvel movie. Man of Steel on the other hand solely backed on the characters popularity. It was a franchise kickstarter. In a similar note look at Iron Man s gross and look at Iron Man s gross. The power of the Marvel brand grew. Audiences dont seem to care about popularity of the characters themselves. Also something else to note Man of Steels gross isnt adjusted for inflation. Man of Steels domestic gross is much higher than Doctor Stranges. So it is most likely WB earned more profits It also had a higher budget but it was covered up by product placements,boxoffice,dde6m5k,4,t5_2r1ky

Also over time titles will lose screens so it can become less convenient or potentially not even possible to see the movie in ones home town.

Avatar then defied conventional predictions on how a movie holds in todays era.  Going further back in time you have Forrest Gump was for a time the rd highest grossing film ever in the US behind ET and Jurassic Park.

Birth of a Nation set a record at Sundance and sold for ..None of those actors other than Redford have a very big asking price for an indy film like this. I bet they got less than a million each.

11497567,0,t3_643ou6,The chatter online now appears to be M openingM total. I say even higher. From April  to May   weeks GotG only has  familyblockbuster contender  Fast . Thats it. And if Fast  drops to a sub M hit as sites are reporting MM then its rd weekend will be irrelevant to the opening of GotG. April and May is so empty I expect Beauty and Boss Baby to enjoy extended stays in the top  until May th. This is of course the calm before the storm as the JuneJuly bloodbath begins with one of the craziest summer schedulings ever. Not a single film should be expected to stay on top for more than a week after GotG comes and goes. My guess M Opening M total.Random ramblings belowIm not sure why Hollywood just decided the female audience isnt important this year. Zero romcoms zero proper animations until DM zero familyoriented event films I guess GotG and PotC are the closest. Theres absolutely nothing made for them from now till midsummer. Thus I expect films like F GotG and WW whatever appears to be more female friendly to get a boost for no reason just because of that. If I were Blumhouse productions Ill branch out from horror to romcoms right now. All the typical romcom castactors seem to be twiddling their thumbs this summer. ,boxoffice,dfz8ytl,11,t5_2r1ky

11500175,0,t1_dfyb61a,Im very curious to see how Waititis quirkiness is received. Fans who are into the MCU for the serialized element andor Hulk DS Thor will almost certainly be happy with an interesting take. If reviews amp WoM establish it as gloriously charming I expect it to outperform the other Thor movies. If reviewers say What in Gods name did I just see?!... I could envision it taking a bigger BO hit than usual due to having another relative Marvel oddball in GotG out earlier in the year. Either way Homecoming looks like a very straightforward storyline not a criticism especially with a beloved character and some RDJ for good measure and scheduling it between movies with different flavors seems like a very good call in a year so stacked with MCU content.    Id be stunned if all three didnt do quite well its just going to be interesting to see how they perform relative to one another.  ,boxoffice,dfzjm8p,5,t5_2r1ky
