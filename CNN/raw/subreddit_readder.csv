10200965,0,t3_5m1cbk,Thanks for the awesome feedback!gt Comment FormattingWYSIWYG editors dont tend to work very well on small devices IMO. Perhaps down the road when I can put in the time to do this right.gt upload a picDirect imgur upload will be available next release.gt As is now on the latest beta if you swipe your comment to the left you have upvote and downvote shortcuts which is brilliant! However swiping to the right lets us collapse? How about leaving comment collapsing to tapping the comment and have  options here.Im trying to optimize for the most frequent actions and a lot of people are used to swiping the comment to collapse it. Perhaps down the road Ill make some changes to this based on feedback.gt User Profiles. Could we have a Karma breakdown?Will be available next release.gt The placement of your own profile access can we make it easier to get to? I was thinking if we could access it from the subreddit selection view? The way Id do is to remove the X closure button and replace it with the Profile icon. Then how do we close the subreddit selection view? Tap the Readder text in the middle much like we do to access this screen do the same to exit it. In doing so we retain the function and gain easier access to our profile overview.Going forward I will be combining the settings and user area for easier access. In any case I think tapping the middle Readder to close is a good idea.gt I havent come across a link yet in Reddit to see if it happens but when somebody links to a Reddit post or link within Reddit itself could we have the app just jump to that link rather than do it via the inapp browser?Thats the way it should behave today. Let me know if youre seeing something else.gt Dark Mode. Personally I love it and I have two suggestions for this.  Make it automatic but not based on screen brightness. I prefer to choose my own time within the app for Dark Mode to come on. For example choose From and To times  until ...that sort of thing.Thats a useful feature many apps offer automatic based on sunrisesunset or something similar and manual like you suggested. Its on my list but as lower priority.gt Also why dont we make it easier to switch to Dark Mode?Im still thinking about the best way to achieve this. I prefer to avoid secret gestures or buttons if I can.gt Is it just me or does the animation from light to dark look a little clunky?It is pretty clunky... I like it and Im not sure why.gt I would love to see an option to have image thumbnails on the right or the leftThe closest thing would be the magazine layout. Perhaps an idea for another layout down the road.gt Bug Report Just found now whilst formatting my wall of text if I scroll up or down lightly the scrolling gets stuck. It takes a few swipes to actually be able to scroll up or down.Do you mean in the New Post window?gt Thats all from me. Again I want to thank you for your time and hard work on this app I really do enjoy using it and watching it grow. I hope you take some of this into consideration or find it good for thought.Thank you. Very helpful stuff.,readder,dc0c4ck,5,t5_3gxjr
11256099,0,t1_df7h1gh,Interesting idea that could be an option but Im hoping it wont come to that. I know reddits working on improving things and Im also looking into what I can do.,readder,df7v19i,1,t5_3gxjr
