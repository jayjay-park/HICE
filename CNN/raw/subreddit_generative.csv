9453439,0,t1_d9df7ga,Hi!  Ive got a hex grid of some  rows and columns which I subdivide into very small portions. Inside I create hexagon items with some variation in color and with some random translation along x y and z axises. Along with these and generally but not uniformly nearer to the screen plane I place little spots of blur and radial translate.I then draw the hexagons and local effects in zorder starting from furthest away moving towards the screen plane.The z ordering in fact creates the circular forms in the result.EDIT  one thing that contributes to watercolor likeness is how the radial translate spots are elliptic and squashed in form.  Because I draw them with random rotation I fancy they create some similarity to how a drop of water sinks and spreads into a paper through tiny pipes in the paper structure.,generative,d9eagrs,2,t5_2sa9t

10328465,0,t3_5nult3,I am sure every works in Processing can be recreated using nodes or Blender scripting. But just slightly different way of thinking.The nice thing about Processing is that it capability to burn pixel and play with opacity to make intricate design. And Processing has this Vector feel sharp. Obviously Processing can be interactive and more.I am learning both.,generative,dcesfd7,1,t5_2sa9t
