9841712,0,t3_566qly,I dunno how or have a kik but heres a copy of my post on redditLemme know if you think we might hit it off! Hey there! My name is Michaela but some people call me Foxy. I work the night shift in Las Vegas. Im  years old and Im just working a lot right now to save up money to pursue my dream of being a traveling photographer. I plan on working A LOT the next year or so then chilling out amp going to visit friends amp start taking dancing lessons again but continue to work pretty heavily for  years after that before I start traveling. I had a cliff jumping injury  months ago so I cant dance so I figured I might as well work my ass off save a ton of money amp then go back to socializing and being a normal person once my knee fully heals! lolHobbies include Dirt bikes Exploring the great outdoors Being a goofball Video games Dancing Flirtingtalking Listening Animals!!! I LOVE animals so freaking muchOh amp Im bisexual so Id rather talk to people who are open minded and accepting of all lifestylescultures  If you think we might jive tell me a little bit about yourself  send your number on over! Have a nice night ,TextingBuddyNeeded,daqecao,1,t5_34b78
