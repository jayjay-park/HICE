3146798,0,t3_2w6iab,These case studies are always fascinating. People view celiac disease gluten sensitivity as primary a GI condition but neurological symptoms are extremely common. I tested positive on the serological markers for CD and my sister tested positive on the biopsy damn genetics so for me these case studies are worrisome and give me extra incentive to avoid gluten. It sucks but what can ya do. At least theres some exciting research going on that aims to cure CD. ,FoodNerds,coo5um6,4,t5_2y9ij
4678346,0,t3_3eztwa,Notes from a smart as fuck dentiststudent not me my friendThe kefir group had a larger decrease in S. mutans.S. mutans was a few decades ago seen as the main pathogen for dental caries but we dont live in that time anymore. Weve realised that caries as all other diseases have more players than one. He compared it to a study checking DOMS to see if a training program was effective i.e. not that relevant.Fluoride mouth rinse is not that good at decreasing S. mutans. S. mutans is more of a marker of sugar intake they are really good at producing acid fast and increased levels of S. mutans is one of the caries risks. So for those patients where S. mutans is a legit risk you usually give them chlorhexidine mouth rinse or might have been a splint cant remember. So a better study would be to check for caries prevention. This study just checks S. mutans and compares it to something that is not that relevant.,FoodNerds,ctk957f,6,t5_2y9ij
