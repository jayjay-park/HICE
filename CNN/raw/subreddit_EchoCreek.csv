On the bright side I have family here so I dont need to worry about looking for a place to stay for a little while.Whats your situation like?,EchoCreek,d7zc00e,1,t5_3fvg0

9670057,0,t3_5dh8oe,gt  Relationships? Who needs ems?Me in a nutshell.Although I really wouldnt mind a SO in my life my last relationship tanked before it even started. gtIn your eyes what are the traits of a successful relationship?Understanding perseverance patience and connection are the big words that jump into my mind. gt  Its really easydifficultetc. for me to become romantically involved with another person. This is because...Difficult. I dont put much thought and heart into dating... Even though I should.gt  Are you addicted to love?Mm no. But Im generally impressed with people who are especially serial monogamists. They seem to have it going on for them well. gt How important is romance to a human being?I guess it is important just like everything else on this planet. gt How important is physical attraction to a romantic relationship? Is it important at all? Does not being physically attracted to someone justify not being romantically interested in them? Conversely would that in your opinion be prejudiced andor shallow? Ethically where do you stand on this subject and why?I think physical attraction is important to a romantic relationship. I used to think that its not important but after a while I kind of figured out what attracts and repulses me in a person. I guess you could lack having physical attraction to someone and not want romantic interests or vice versa. It doesnt matter. People have preferences. However terms such as sapiosexual or yellow fever need to be ditched. They both have pretentious andor discriminatory connotations. ,EchoCreek,da51csr,1,t5_3fvg0
