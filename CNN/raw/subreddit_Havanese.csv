2146487,0,t3_2jd5ay,I dont have any experience in this as I only have had one dog and he is OK though not thrilled with grooming.  This subreddit is very slow overall for more exposure with your question maybe try HavaneseForum.com that is a very active board with many experienced owners trainers etc..,Havanese,clco1g6,1,t5_2rrbo
10312233,0,t3_5nlipd,I think it is. We did our best to stop it and failed. They are little watch dogs. I read somewhere to acknowledge their good work and tell them thank you and  now please be quiet. They want to let us know that someone is there. It is hard but try to act extremely calm and reassuring but firm. Yelling shut up doesnt work.  ,Havanese,dccy4pw,11,t5_2rrbo
