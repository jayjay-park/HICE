He says dont buy into these people just because they show off their flashy life and stand in front of Lamborghinis. What is ironic about this is Allen Wong himself has a get rich quick kind of book called lifehacked which not only features a Lamborghini on the cover but also a model girl sitting in the car. If thats not flashy enough his facebook is nothing but Lamborghinis  and his elaborate lifestyle. This guy is such a hypocrite its ridiculous. Unlike what he says in the video hes really only had  big app and that app has been dead for a while. His main base of income is from showing off his lambo and flaunting his lifestyle so people buy his book hoping to one day be like him.  Edit Here are the links to his Here is his book Here is his facebook Noticed how this book website has pictures of lambos all over it. If you watch the video all he really talks about is his lambo and being rich. Also notice that his facebook is filled with nothing but articles about himself lambos flying planes  girls posing with his car etc etc. ,motivation,cgqewq5,2,t5_2qvm1

FYI I dont make any money off of this its just an outlet for my thoughts.Basically my advice to you is to think about the things you would want to do if you didnt have to worry about anything else. And if you cant think of anything then seek out some experiences that might help you find it. Try going hiking or working on a farm for a day or water skiiing. These experiences will help you find your passions. Your motivation will follow. I hope that helpsBrad,motivation,cmt6g6d,1,t5_2qvm1

3487076,0,t3_2zzkzs,Ok heres the long version holy shit. It got long as fuck. My bad.. Properly told it starts from my childhood. Its also about half of the story of my life so far so its difficult to only include the parts that are relevant to your question. Ill try to cut out what isnt necessary to understand where I was coming from at the time. I was born in to a fairly wealthy family. We didnt have Porsches but we went to a private school and Christmas was a fucking blast. The money came from my dads side of the family. Each of us kids were given a trust fund by my grandfather to be given to us when we went to college the usage of which was to be overseen by my father. When it was turned over to me it had grown to about K. But Im moving a bit too fast. I had problems in school. I couldnt ever pay attention. Very often Id find myself suddenly realizing that something important had just been discussed and that I had no idea what any of it was. Id often be given things to take home to my parents and almost always forgot. This didnt go unnoticed and I got talked to about it a lot. Made me feel pretty bad about myself. Pretty stupid. Getting almost exclusively bad grades didnt help. I was often in danger of being held back. As it turned out I had ADHD. I was given Ritalin but taken off shortly after cause my parents said it turned me in to a zombie. I never noticed a difference. Due mostly to having a poor ability to concentrate and partly to random incidents of bad luck I got left out of certain social events sometimes. Id like to say that it happened a lot but it probably didnt. Things like that dont need to happen a lot though to have serious effects on you as a child. What did happen a lot was getting picked on by my brothers. I was the youngest so you can imagine. All that combined is what I like to think made me believe that I just didnt belong in the world. That something was wrong with me. That I just wasnt built to function along side everyone else. That everyone else was better than me and there was nothing I could do about it. Then my parents split. I lived with my mom. She didnt handle it well. Had this delusional idea about the new millennium turning her in to a new woman. Shes also a narcissist narcissists make horrible parents Im aware of rraisedbynarcissists and became almost completely self absorbed. If there had been any real guidance in my life before then it all stopped at that point. I was allowed to do whatever the fuck I wanted to whenever the fuck I wanted to do it. And I did. Cue high school. I did predictably terrible freshman year. However things turned around once my mom introduced me to adderall pretty much the same thing as Ritalin. I guess since she took it herself she didnt mind if I became a zombie and holy hell did I notice a difference this time. Adderall is amazing and I recommend it more often than Freud prescribed cocaine. Seriously OP this may be as far as you need to read if youre not already on that shit. I started doing amazing in class and things were looking great. But things didnt stay great. I abused the shit out of adderall and... Yea not much else of high school is terribly relevant. I missed a lot of days didnt get enough credits somehow its a blur I dont remember much and ended up not being allowed to walk in the graduation ceremony. I graduated after taking keyboarding in summer school but the exclusion from the last big event of childhood only added to the sense that I didnt belong because I sucked. Oh and I had a job in high school at a car wash. For like  months or something. I went to college clueless. Took a math and English class as well as some other general classes or something its a blur. I also signed up for what they call Integrated Systems Technology a delightfully fancy way to say industrial maintenance. Being mechanically inclined I felt that I would excel there. Thank God for that decision. By the end of my first semester I had dropped everything that wasnt IST. To be fair this had a considerable amount to do with breaking up with my gf and never wanting to run in to her IST had its own building and I was safe in there but it would have happened eventually anyway cause college is harder than high school and I just wasnt cutting it. But I thrived in IST. Shit was thoroughly my bitch. I actually got certified as an automated electronic systems specialist even though I had no idea that Id finished the required courses for it. Kinda cool. I finished everything they had minus welding and CAD and went back to being a clueless low life living completely irresponsibly off of Oh! I forgot a partThis whole time in college Ive been blowing through my trust fund like its never gonna run out. My manipulative mother had decided to use us kids against my father in the separation made it out to be as much our decision as it was hers. I was like.. ? and he resented us for it. So his attitude was basically you dont want me around fine I wont do shit for you. Have fun blowing all your money dumbass. and just wrote me a check for whatever I said I wanted. Weve talked about it. I dont blame him and were good now. my trust fund Did I format that correctly? Im almost certain I didnt. Someone who didnt drop English in college help me out. How do you put a story on hold and then pick it back up like that? until I got down to just a few grand and decided to save money by telling all my freeloading roommates to fuck off and went back to living with my mom. She decides to move to the middle of nowhere IL shortly after. I take up residence in her basement and stay there for three years. During this time I thought about getting a job but the mere consideration of employment would instantly throw me in to the midst of a panic attack. I have no skills Im a failure at life Everyone knows it They can see it as soon as I walk in the door Theyll laugh at me as soon as Im gone Even if I do get a job itll be unbearable Ive been living so free and carelessly for so long theres no way I can transition in to a daily routine Itll be another failure to make me feel even worse about myself and Ill never get over it and then therell be no hope at all. Fetal position. Hyperventilate. Only once did I actually manage to turn in a job application. I didnt follow up on it even though they called me back.  And so I stayed underground hidden from the world slipping slowly in to madness due to an adderall addiction that I shared symbiotically with my mother at this point and nearcomplete social isolation. Good times until I realized how long it had actually been and almost killed myself. Kind of an interesting story but irrelevant even though its not long. And so this is the point in my story where I start to feel like you do now OP. No one had ever given enough of a fuck about me to make sure that I had the life skills to survive beyond feeding and dressing myself. If Id died in that basement itd have been days before anyone even found me. Im just lost. I dont know where or when I went wrong but whenever that was wherever it was everyone else got taught something that I missed. Something about living properly in the world. Id suck up the embarrassment and shame of it all and just ask someone anyone at this point but I dont even know what to ask. How do I identify and put in to words that one thing that everyone else just knows has known for so long and knows so well that its simply ingrained in all of their everyday doings?

3782620,0,t1_cqnf758,Look exercise is always a plus. Not only it improves your cardiovascular health but it gives you a little room to eat a little more. For instance running  mins burns like  calories which means you can eat a little more each day and still dont go over the limit. So Im not encouraging you to stop exercising at all.But is it necessary to lose weight? No. All you need to do is stay under the limit. Say at maintenance your body burns  calories a day the app will tell you what your maintenance is based on your stats if you eat  a day youll lose about a pound a week a pound of bodyfat is worth around  calories.Some other tips Try to eat a lot of protein and fibers. These food fills you for a longer time meaning that youll get less hungry and make the reduced calorie intake easier to stomach.When you weigh yourself try to do it just after you wake up so the results are more consistent they dont depend on how much foodwater youve eaten that day. Also try not to measure your weight too often. Id do it once a week. The reason is that your weight fluctuates a little bit so youll maybe way more one day and get discouraged while actually overall your weight is heavily trending downwards. If you weigh yourself once a week youll almost always see progress you youll be encouraged. Same with pictures take before pics which are great and counter body dysmorphia but not too often no more than once a month. I dont know how much you weigh but depending on that even one month may not make a noticeably difference aesthetically so just trust the scale.  Also youll probably lose several pounds the first couple of weeks which will be mostly water weight. This is very encouraging but dont get discouraged when the rate slows down to what your calorie deficit says. Another tip Dont go on an eating rampage when youre too hungry. If you feel super hungry eat something and wait ten minutes. Youll be a little bit more filled then and it will not seem so urgent to stuff yourself with food. When you feel hungry try to just feel the hunger stay conscious of it and realize its not the end of the world to be hungry you can live with it and just go on. We are so used to instantly satisfying the impulse to it that we dont realize we can go without eating for one more hour and not die P.Good luck!,motivation,cqng3wq,1,t5_2qvm1

Basically grind a little harder every day be uncomfortable but dont get so uncomfortable you lose your mind and forget where you are lolEdit its a state of mind where youre always uncomfortable. You can only increase your capacity to workwill yourself so much on a daily basis. Nothing beats slow continuous consistency. Writing down short term goals and achieving them is a great way to know youre making small improvements. Very very very small improvements every day. Like an exponential growth curve.

Remember you were shortlisted because people with experience who are likely also thinking they arent qualified chose you. No one will expect a college student or a recent college graduate to have a clue. The key is to remain honest about that and open to learning the processes once you begin. As far as staying focused in school remember every hour you spend is gone forever. Try to spend your time in a way that will provide the best options for how to spend future hours.
