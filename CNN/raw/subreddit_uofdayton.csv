Were considered upper middle class where I livewhich is really sad when you think about itThis makes me love and hate American education system.No matter how good you are in schoolyoull still need money for higher education.Then againonly makes universities good which makes them desirable for people like me.Thank you though!,uofdayton,cnh0ps9,1,t5_2spi6
