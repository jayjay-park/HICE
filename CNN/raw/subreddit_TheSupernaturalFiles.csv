He never did have a lot of friends  I mean as you can probably tell by looking around at the turn out. It was just him Janie and Delilah. Now that David and Janie are gone... Craigs voice trailed off. He was visibly struggling his eyes glistening in the sun from the moisture building up on them.Delilah shes all alone now. I feel for the poor girl. I really do. It reminds me of when I was a youngn.Yes there was some witnesses they saw what happened but nobody really knows why  at least from what we can tell from the little were being told. Were sure the students are just in shock. As for the two responsible whats been printed in the paper is all theyve told us. Theyve stuck to a vow of silence since then.,TheSupernaturalFiles,clmz9hi,1,t5_347sa
