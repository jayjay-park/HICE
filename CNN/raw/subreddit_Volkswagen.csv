If the GTI wheels and tires have been on the car for a while it might need an alignment or the noisy tires could have been caused by lack of rotation. If the tires are cupped or have feathered edges you will have to replace the tires which is a significant cost if the car has the  inch GTI wheels.

592663,0,t3_20x2bk,If they dont know when the chains have been done then Id be listening and wanting to inspect that.  For the vr v engines there arent a whole lot of things that can really kill them.  They are pretty stout engines and last as long as you do regular maintenance.  With bad timing chain guides you can kind of hear a repetitive tapping like sound.  The sound is of the chain moving more than it should because a timing chian guide or rail has been worn through.Other than that that car has k miles.  Be prepared to be working on that car to fixrepair things.  You can look at what you should look at with all older cars like that.  Anything rubber bushings plastics and moving parts for extra wear or any signs of metal rubbing where it shouldnt be.  Control arms check those bushings and the ball jointtie rod end if possible.

625860,0,t3_21b4xl,gtIve never had a short sister before so I am curious. Well not sure about using this subreddit but hey my sister is about   and let me tell you she seems to be very comfortable with her height.  She even married a   guy so a full foot taller but they make it work.  She even just had a kid.  She stopped growing in the th or th grade and so even at   she was one of the tallest girls.  She had her run on the basketball teams being one of the best players but that time has long since passed.  Im sure she treasures the memories but I dont think she cares about playing basketball too much these days.  Especially with a kid.Overall I imagine its like having any kind of sister. Unless shes a bitch but thats totally unrelated to height unless her height puts a chip on her shoulder.As for your short shifter question I have the dieselgeek short shifter on my Mk Jetta Sportwagen TDI however its a speed tranny. I LOVE IT.  Even after  years I think theyre one of the best bolton upgrades for the car.  Those first few drives it felt like I was driving a race car.  Its truly an amazing feel once you get over the idea that since YOU installed it yourself that it could slip and youll be stuck somewhere unable to shift into gear.  However  years later no issues and Ive never had to tighten it.It just makes your shifts feel notchier like youre actually feeling the transmission clunk into gear.,Volkswagen,cgbet9b,8,t5_2qr4f

Because to change the upper one is easy lower one means the transmission has to be on the floor. Also check the reverse gear on both. It should not be noisy. If it has a slight growl to it its just a bit nicked and will live. But if its really noisy its gonna need transmission work. Basically take it on a test drive make sure it doesnt jump out of gear it dont knock and it doesnt skip. ,Volkswagen,chscosr,2,t5_2qr4f

1552557,0,t3_2c08kk,Im going to apologise in advance this post may come across as negative or indeed cynical but I can assure you its not my intention to dissuade you but rather to share some observations.My advice would be to not lead with the I want to build a car bit people seem to have a thing against kickstarters they perceive as begging regardless of the content.  Take a look through rshittykickstarters if you want to see where that inevitably leads  just a whole lot of Why should I pay for Xs Y.  A lot of this has been attributed to Kickstarters recent relaxation of their submission rules but with that explosion of projects comes a need for you to find a way to stand out.  Of course its worth remembering that people are also fickle you can never be sure if your idea is just crazy enough to work until people jump all over it potato salad anyone?.If theres a mediumfuture event that youre looking to first show off the car at something like a documentary  perhaps with the involvement of other enthusiasts with similar goals history of VW something like that leading toward the event where the car build is a part but not the whole thing would go a long way.  Yes itll be a whole chunk more work but it has the additional advantage of the footage being another backer reward.  On the other hand you can weave it into your work as documentation of the build you might get to film some fun road trips depending on where you are and where yours was built visit the factory for instance hell have some fun and timelapse the garage for the whole build duration.Id be surprised if there wasnt a subreddit dedicated to planning crowdfunding campaigns possibly some of the links in the sidebar of rkickstarter will be helpful.Best of luck do remember to post progress back here.,Volkswagen,cjavx42,1,t5_2qr4f

SOme cars though more than other depending on how they equipped. car is DSG transmission require fluid changed every K miles. thats just an example but some car like the base model Jetta S is really no more than oil changes and tire rotations. up untill the end of  VW would cover  and K service them being in order oil change tire rotate oil change tire rotate and cabin air filter than oil change tire rotate and brake fluid flush. in  they started covering just  and K service now in  it is just the K service. Now you can purchase plans through VW that will cover the out of pocket money for those services for longer than  yeark miles but that is something you local dealer would need to cover more in depth Im not in salesfinance. just a technician. I imagine some other cars services may be cheaper but they also may not. i cant imagine it being much different than say some of the Japanese cars. Check out a  Jetta S. it uses a .  cylinder engine not the best on gas not the fastest or best sounded or efficeient compared to the . TSI motor but its a bull very reliable. design hasnt changed much since the s for that car all you would be doing is oil changes every year and a trans service at  years K miles the other services i discussed would also be covered that being if you get the extended maintenance plan. great car now you can get them with a technology package different radio and such. feel free to ask me any questions you have about VW and any other car related questions as well i will do my best to help .,Volkswagen,cmr7qdb,2,t5_2qr4f

4180040,0,t1_crwlapb,I have had many Volkswagens in the recent past and sadly a few issues where VW had to get involved.  Every time that I have had to deal with a VW regional manager things have worked out pretty well not fast but well.  As stated in another comment the wear items may be a tough sell but stick to your guns and see what VW will do for you.  As in any negotiation stay calm and civil.  I know that it can be a major pain and it is sensitive because  is a good chunk of change.  From my experiences VW has always stepped up to the plate and worked with the dealer and myself to come to a reasonable solution.  I always tried to email the sales person Dealership manager or  VW manager after every phone call with a summary.  Then there was a paper trail and if any correspondence was had that way you have their recognition in writing not bullet proof but helps your case.  Just be sure to set firm follow up dates so that they know you are not going to let it just sit there waiting and you set an expectation of this being resolved as quickly as possible.  Good Luck! I love my Golf R and hope that you can get your issues ironed out to start enjoying the car. ,Volkswagen,crwq8tg,2,t5_2qr4f

Also the clutch will NEED to be done soon if its never been done.  Guy says its one of the quickest motors and follows up immediately says hes babied it.  I dont the you get intake exhaust and a tune in order to baby it.  I wouldnt trust it.  Even at k itd be a risk.  Worst case scenario you get the car at  then then the followers fail and the chain jumps thats a new engine.  Best case you get it for k do nothing and it lasts you for k and needs the clutch done with no other issues.  Realistically youll get it for  and it needs a clutch which can get pricey and you do the followers preventatively and you are out another k unless you do it yourself and your out  and however long it takes you.

4272465,0,t1_cs76nbh,Dont feel bad at all. Having gone from a  Rabbit to a  GTI I can honestly say the jump in performance wasnt exactly staggeringly huge. In fact purely from a performance standpoint Id say paying the extra amount for a GTI isnt worth it.The new .T is a great base trim engine with plenty of torque. It feels somewhere in between the old .L and previous gen .T which says a lot IMO. And if you ever decide that you want more power later on you can still mod it to perform better than a stock GTII think the handling is where you really start to see the value in what you pay for with the GTI. It just feels much more confident and composed overall. Theres less body roll and the suspension is just much more responsive. On the plus side you can always get a set of DriverGear or VWR springs for a Golf to solve that problem if it bothers you for a relatively low price. But you also need to factor in that the GTI also has wider  wheels too.The interior does get an upgrade too. Although with the Mk generation that gap closes a lot. In fact aside from the steering wheel seats and interior colors... jumping into a GTI hardly feels like that big of an upgrade from an interior standpoint. But with the MkMk generation the interior differences were bigger IMO.,Volkswagen,cs782vm,1,t5_2qr4f

After that Ill probably pay  every k miles to get regular oil changes etc.  Might just get a few jacks and do it myself to save some money.I dont have Gap coverage and I dont think it is worth buying.  Determine the total price of the gap insurance.  If it costs  ask yourself whether youd rather have  and if you do total your car very unlikely would you be okay replacing it with a used one with the insurance payout?  For example if you buy the Jetta today for k and total it tomorrow without gap insurance youll get an insurance payout of k.  Thats not enough to buy a new Jetta so youll have to just get a used albeit nearly new one for k.  But youll still be on the hook for the k loan.,Volkswagen,cszer44,2,t5_2qr4f

A lot of people say that German cars are unreliable but if you do the proper maintenance at proper intervals it could last you a loong time.As far as cosmetics tints and wheels are a good start. Some people like changing up their bumpers going from GTI to R Thunderbunny  or Jetta bumpers. Personally I like the look of them when theyre lowered an inch or so but thats personal preference plus it can affect your ride quality. Roof racks can definitely change the way the car looks not to mention that theyre useful. Something I like doing every now and then is to head over to WalMart and buy a can of PlastiDip and change up the color of my emblems its a simple thats easily reversible. You can also buymod your tailights into LED lights google it for details.As far as online stores  more for performance parts Lots of aesthetic parts My best advice would be to cruise the forums both golfmkv and vwvortex if its doable chances are its been done and documented on one of those sites.

If you go into a slippery corner and start with some under steer just let off the gas.  If you try power through by applying more throttle youre just going to increase the under steer and hit the wall.Other than that with a FWD you can give it the beans off a stop and not worry too much about tail sliding into the guy next to you and its way easier to get out of deep snow where you would typically be stuck with an RWD.Oh and regardless of FWD or RWD get winter tires and you will have no problems ,Volkswagen,cz22p0r,3,t5_2qr4f

Any car less than  years old has to meet current safety standards which is unlikely that VW tested this particular model as it is built to US safety standards.  Next issue is with EPA standards the car must meet the standards for the model year that it was produced in this case .  China does not have the same pollution standards that the US has so it must be brought up to those standards which is where you will spend a considerable amount of money.  Next you will have to pay an import tax to get it released from customs which is usually . to  percent of the retail value of the car.   The car must also meet the vehicle bumper and theft prevention standards if not it must be brought up to those standards before it is released.After all that headache you have to pay state tax and registration on the vehicle and if you are in California you must meet additional emission standards.Total nightmares for newer cars in my opinion. ,Volkswagen,d0e2zy4,3,t5_2qr4f

There are plenty where I live that drive me crazy because they make my car hum. Its only a mile or two of the road but there are a couple that do it. Second and more importantly you say the vibrations happen at random speeds but is it always the same sets of speeds? If it is thats an indication that it is part related perhaps a bubble in the tire.

9031845,0,t3_53x0ha,Im not sure why everyone is giving you hate on your car.  Your car should reflect your style which it clearly does.  Dont listen to the haters.Also in some states its illegal to purchase a flooded vehicle I know this is Louisiana law with the case with the recent flooding.  Even if it is legal in Virgina its still probably a terrible idea.  Youll get a salvaged title on the car meaning its been totalled out which will impact the value of the car tremendously.  Youll never get any good money for the car when you go to eventually sell it on and youll be dealing with flooded out components in your car.  Electrical seating etc. all really hate water if you know what I mean.  Your insurance should give you replacement value on a comparable car for your model yearmileage.  Just make sure you check what your adjuster is telling you.  Theyll pull up some comparables to work up a valuation on your car and its important that you double check their work.  Make sure they account for accessories you had on the car.  Make sure the cars they find are located in or around your area and that the mileagecondition are approximately the same as your car.  Just be vigilant.  The adjuster is not there to be your friend.  Hes there to represent the insurance company.Sorry for your loss bro.,Volkswagen,d7xhgps,2,t5_2qr4f

9790827,0,t3_5f83ba,value for the car you receive. Yes a bmw and mercedes has more refinement and class but not for double the price of the car. Plus in the vw class the competition doesnt have the refinement. Other brands are just literally different. Not that its bad for people who value other things over what vw offers. Not everyone cares how a car feels or values their car enough to keep up with maintenance. I owned ford cheapest feeling car ive owned.I owned pointiacgmc pontiac firebird had a thing going its last couple years but couldnt last. I ended up getting the pontiac G the last year they were around and the quality was completly gone. The paint was super thin the interior stitching was coming apart within a year. I always cherish my  firebird formula convertible though. Gmc was flashy but cheap materials.I owned a volvo s t ok this car was pretty good the interior was very bland like ikea though and its a brand no one really cares about modding.Then i owned a bmw and mercedes.I would say the bmw was the best car I have every owned. The quality was amazing the drive was amazing the look was amazing. But the car also retailed at over k. The mercedes on the other hand was a vw passat  but double the price with some fancier interior materials.Having owned both the luxury cars I can say that the vw feels  what they feel like. So from a economical stand point its stupid to pay double for . Thats how I look at it.,Volkswagen,dajxkvx,4,t5_2qr4f
