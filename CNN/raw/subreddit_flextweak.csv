567625,0,t3_20dkvp,Spotify gets updated crazy fast and they know about Flex since they already patched the limited skips workaround that enabled you to seek to the end of the song. I just installed an earlier version of the app they havent really added anything worth having as far as I can tell. ,flextweak,cg4slpk,1,t5_2w93m
