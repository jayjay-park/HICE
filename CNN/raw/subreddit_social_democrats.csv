5748095,0,t1_cx9dzwp,gt As with most state surveillance Im not currently able to access government documents on what we know is happening or not happening so I cant attest to the current scale of alleged UK operations. Im a firm believer that privacy is a key right of the individual in an open democracy and that data protection laws must be upheld. There is voluminous evidence of GCHQ bulk surveillance. It isnt controversial in the United Kingdom where it has been the subject of extensive litigation. The broad strokes and key details are already public and analyzed by civil society groups such as Privacy International and by journalists with long standing expertise in this area such as Duncan Campbell and James Bamford.It is not credible for you to pretend that these practices are alleged nor is it credible for you to hedge your response to this question by pretending that the key details remain unknown. We are living through a wholesale erosion of the rights of entire populations of people by the state security apparatus of developed economies. A credible left wing alternative must at the least articulate a solid objection to this process rather than avoiding the question as if you felt it forced too explicit a commitment from you. Whose side are you on?,social_democrats,cx9lv67,-1,t5_394t3
5761829,0,t1_cxbarcl,uSJHennelly please answer the question. I know you said you will respond eventually but it doesnt look like youll be back. Ive even emailed the SDs a month or two ago with the same question and no response. Its a shame because theyve given me a glimmer of hope for politics in this country.,social_democrats,cxbb43y,2,t5_394t3
5768318,0,t1_cxbx5db,Are you prepared to tackle thorny issues such as oneoff housing an issue which is managing to simultaneously do huge damage both rural and urban Ireland!? It would be deeply unpopular to take this on but a progressive party with a long term sustainable vision must do so if the the well being of the whole society is what they are about. ,social_democrats,cxc431i,1,t5_394t3
