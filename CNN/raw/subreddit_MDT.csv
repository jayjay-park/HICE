7978916,0,t3_4ohapr,Make sure youre using the builtin partition and formatting steps.   Creating your own Diskpart steps can cause weirdness.  Make sure youre putting GPT partitions on UEFI machines and MBR partitions on BIOS machines.Id probably boot to PE Diskpart and format and imagex the custom wim on manually to narrow down if its a problem with the image or the task sequence.You could also run the task sequence on another machine and see what happens.,MDT,d4cwlnp,4,t5_2v3bh

11492685,0,t3_63vkm5,You can specify a product key when you create a task sequence using the task sequence wizard. You can also specify it when you create the unattend.xml file. Deployed system needs to be able to connect to the internet if you are using a MAK key.  Why are you using a MAK key to deploy instead of running a KMS? ... Edit Id forgotten where a couple items were after you create the task sequence. For your existing task sequence try adding your MAK to the existing Unattend.xml . It lives in your deployment share directory under ControlTASKSEQUENCEIDNAME . Put the key in ltproductkeygtltkeygtKEYGOESHEREltkeygtltproductkeygt,MDT,dfyp0s3,1,t5_2v3bh
