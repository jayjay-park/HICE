3723119,0,t1_cnm3vk4,Sorry I missed this when you originally posted it.  Thanks for the comment!Its that value that is largely tempting to me.  While I really love the options with the Topo Design bags the clean and stylish look of them the fact that theyre made in the USA that price hurts my wallet just a little too much to justify it after already picking up a plenty useful EDC bag.I think this would make a great option for someone on a very tight budget or someone who wants a second bag for whatever reason.  It even looks like theyve reduced the price since it was originally posted Now  instead of  !,whatsinthebag,cqgntxs,1,t5_33nk5
4698743,0,t1_ctmlbjl,I did a little write up on the bag over on the one bag sub reddit heres a copyWell I have been lurking here for a while and finally had some time to take some pictures of what I am currently using as my one bag. I am not a traditional one bagger I own a home and have many possessions typical of a more traditional life style. With that being said I do have a bag that I keep packed and carry with me daily and the goal of this bag is to allow me to travel in comfort to most reasonable places with little notice. I am fortunate enough to have a career that provides me with a significant amount of flexibility and freedom and the goal of my one bag is to allow me to travel spontaneously. There is nothing I find more liberating that being able to hop on a plane or go on a multiday road trip with no notice.Currently I am using a Jansport Pleasanton as my go to bag and since it seems to be difficult to find any reviews on the bag I thought I would share my experiences here. Previously I was using and sometimes still use a Tom Bihn Smart Alec. I am a very big fan of the Smart Alec the build quality and layout make it an excellent choice and one that I highly recommend. However I really love the look of the Pleasanton and feel like the more distressed it becomes the better it will look over time. In terms of build quality of the Pleasanton I think there is something to be desired. For nearly  you should be getting a bag that should absolutely last a life time and when you feel the bag in person it simply doesnt feel like it is the same quality as some of the more popular choices here Goruck Tom Bihn etc.. The waxed cotton twill seems to be thin and the zippers dont feel as smooth or robust as higher quality YKK zippers. Frankly I think you could do much better in terms of build quality especially at this price point. Now to be fair I have carried this bag daily for about  months in  different countries and it has held up wonderfully and it comes with a life time warranty I have heard mixed reviews about how well they stand behind their products lately so only time will tell how this bag performs long term.There are still quite a few things I like about the bag and it is still my go to option over the other bags I have. The Pleasanton is relatively light weight at lb oz and I like the organization it provides. It has a laptop compartment that you can access from the rear of the bag to make airport travel easier and a separate compartment for a tablet or eReader. I use eagle creek packing cubes to help with storage in the main compartment a medium for my clothes and a quarter cube for my chargers and cables. However even with minimal packing lists and compact travel specific gear it is a bit cramped in the L of space available. I also carry this bag to the office and keep a notepad and a few pens in the bag specifically for work purposes and I like that bag is discrete enough to not seem out of place.,whatsinthebag,ctmtdh6,2,t5_33nk5

6283120,0,t1_cz3pkcd,? The GR has a front section with three zippered mesh areas and a nonmesh zippered organization area that opens independent of the primary storage area. And then the main area has two more zippered mesh areas and an elastic pouch. Then there is the padded laptop storage against your back and slant pocket on the front. ,whatsinthebag,cz3tj54,2,t5_33nk5
