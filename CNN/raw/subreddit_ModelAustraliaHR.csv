7147307,0,t1_d1qk5zr,For those interested in further reading I quote from Brief Guides to Senate Procedure while being technically relevant to the Senate the same principle is used in the House.gtThe question on an amendment to delete a clause item or proposed new section or a larger unit such as a Subdivision Division Part or Schedule is put in the form That the unit stand as printed. This is designed to test whether the unit has majority support. An equally divided vote on that question results in it being decided in the negative and the unit being removed from the bill. If on the other hand the question took the form of That the amendment to omit the unit be agreed to an equally divided vote would result in that question being lost and a unit which did not have majority support remaining in the bill. Amendments of this type are always drafted in the form unit TO BE OPPOSED and are always put by the chair separately from other amendments. Note however that this practice does not apply to requests for amendments which must be supported by a majority see below.,ModelAustraliaHR,d1qkpbq,1,t5_3bqco

8630789,0,t3_4xgx9c,Right of ReplyMr SpeakerI rise to make my right of reply.Not a single NLP member Crossbench Member Independent Member or even the Labor Government other than the quip by the Prime Minister has risen. Or even a Greens member.If the Government wishes to complain that the House is not actually doing any work they should look at their own inactivity. If the Opposition thinks they can do a better job they should first lift up their debating skills.Since no one has actually complained about this Bill in the House I assume that everyone will vote for it. After all people have had quite a few days now if they have any objections to it to voice their concerns. If they dont have any concerns and then proceed to vote against it that is just a shame.The Hon.
