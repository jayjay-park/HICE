5974152,0,t1_cy2h783,This is as much an answer to your question as to uDeegius . You have different methods  depending on the location. Is this it would seem that they stitched the the edges which could reach. The rest is left open with a big white pad to keep it moistIn other procedures such as the bascom procedure you mobilize the skin by seperating it from the fatty tissue as seen in the middle picture left skin flap.The skin will proliferate and create new skin but right now you want something to cover up that hole to avoid infection. The graft is still connected to his forehead to ensure the blood supply though later removed.edit links,SurgeryGifs,cy2qqu1,13,t5_31vap

6556239,0,t1_czxf1st,Actually adrenalineepinephrine is contraindicated for use in digits and the penis. Because the blood vessels are so small in those areas the vasoconstrictive nature of the epinephrine has the potential to not let the vessels relax to their normal state again which can cause problems with circulation.  Thats not to say I havent seen doctors do it on occasion though.,SurgeryGifs,czxgw2h,3,t5_31vap

7165739,0,t1_d1s4ntd,IANAD but it looks like premature atrial contractions  those will happen inside the body occasionally as well. I dont know specifically why it might be happening more often here.    Edit nevermind after a closer look the atria and ventricles appear to be on separate rhythms. Maybe a heart block or AV disassociation? Someone with more knowledge than me should chime in Id love to know what this is ,SurgeryGifs,d1socrl,1,t5_31vap
