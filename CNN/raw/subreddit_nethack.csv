It should be noted that the bottom five suggestions here are basically AceHacks terrain command with eatlootpay being the exceptions. terrain was bound to gt but this was pretty unpopular it seems that some players rely on gt only taking stairs in one direction to keep track of where they are in the dungeon.In general I suspect NetHack benefits a lot from its wide range of verbs and little contextsensitivity. It adds a lot to the TDTTOE nature of the game in that it gives a simple way to more or less automatically ensure that a wide range of plausible actions have some way to enter them. Contextsensitive actions destroy that what if you want to sit on the food?

But since this is your first time this close to ascension I suppose an amulet of life saving would be some nice insurance.  Keep in mind that you wont be able to twoweapon with an amulet of life saving because youll need reflection from the shield instead of your amulet.  twoweapon is definitely the way to go though if you arent going to wear an amulet of life saving.  I do recommend life saving in your case but Id consider waiting a bit to see if you might find one.Rings of conflict are very nice but Id try polypiling for one before using a wish.  Magic markers also make for great wishes if you could benefit from some additional scrolls.  Scrolls of magic mapping are nice in Gehennom.Have you done the quest yet?  There are plenty of fire ants and fire giants from which you can gain fire resistance from.  Be careful though because fire traps can spawn on the ice which can be a real nuisance.
