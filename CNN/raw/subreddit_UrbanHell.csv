I think many lots closer to Center City mainly those in North Philly and Kensington will eventually be developed somehow. Other areas further away Im not too sure if the city even cares too much. The Logan Triangle has been undeveloped for almost  years now. I used to live on a block that got demolished. I was  when we got relocated and Im currently . If its not profitable the city is gonna be slow to move. Though I am happy to see progress happening here even if it is concentrated to a few areas. Its only good for the city. ,UrbanHell,cz7gnky,2,t5_2yokk
