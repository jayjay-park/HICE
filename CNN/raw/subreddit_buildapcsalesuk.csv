5018582,0,t1_cuqxc8y,Hz is VERY noticeable should you be able to achieve it even just moving things on the desktop looks wayyyy smoother. p looks really nice too and definitely an upgrade from p again should you be able to run it. Playing Witcher  with maxed settings at  p on an IPS panel is absolutely GORGEOUS. If you are getting a Ti then its definitely worth it for this screen if not then youd be better off getting a non Gsync one and upgrading your GPU. As for factoring in a budget for a display put it this way Its what you will be spending  of your time looking at so a good screen should be high on your list of priority for good parts.,buildapcsalesuk,cuqxhsx,1,t5_2slj0

8763224,0,t1_d7125d0,Its a great cooler for lower wattage chips but it doesnt really hold up against the higher TDP ones. I had to have a mm fan blowing directly onto the cooler to keep the temperatures at a point I was comfortable with and I dont have room to do that in my new case.
