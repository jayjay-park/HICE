As soon as I picked him up he grabbed my face with his paws and started licking my nose.  Its three years later and he still does that.  If you enjoy a cat that is going to essentially be a barnacle my is constantly leaning on my shoulder  get a manx.  If you enjoy a cat that is going to fight to get under the covers with you and is going to sleep cuddled under your arm ALL NIGHT get a manx.  If you enjoy a cat that is smart enough to answer to his own name and a few simple commands get a manx.  If you want a cat that gets along with dogs get a manx.I dont know if those apply to all manxs but they sure as hell apply to mine.,manx,d4dxgbf,1,t5_2tbni
