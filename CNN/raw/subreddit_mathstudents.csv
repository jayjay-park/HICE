11710100,0,t3_673036,So Im at a school with a pretty decent ML program and have a strong math background and I can tell you a lot of folks doing machine learning dont know that much about the maths involved. But be aware that when people say you dont need advanced mathematics to understand how to use a library they mean you dont need to know measure theory or representation theory to apply these algorithms. To build new libraries and discover new techniques you will most definitely have to get into some heavier maths but you probably wont be getting to any frontiers of mathematical research. ,mathstudents,dgndb9e,1,t5_2x87c
