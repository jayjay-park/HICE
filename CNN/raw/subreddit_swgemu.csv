The formula for speed delay is   speed skill mod    weapon speed  ability delay. Ability delay varies with attacks. You can use   to see which weapon and attack is best as you are leveling up. Skill mods can only increase that skill attribute by   skill mod attribute per equipment so you cant put  pistol speed and  into a  socket shirt and expect  Any amount on a skill mod will help.,swgemu,chfoas8,2,t5_2rpa5

If PVP is your preferred time passing activity in games SWGEmu is probably not for you.  As far as what else to do well its a sandbox.  Next publish will be adding a bunch of quests in addition to existing ones.  There are imperial jabba rebel and marauder theme parks.   As far as high end mobs go there are krayts nightsisters geo cave kimos.  DWB is a bit buggy but doable if you avoid certain mobs.  You can roll a ranger and take out resource contracts.  Craft run a business run a resource mining business.  Next patch adds a much more robust AI system so that will make Creature Handler Droid Engineer and Bio Engineer work much closer as in live so that adds a new aspect to the game.

3527548,0,t1_cpu2r16,Thats a fallacy friend. The CU and NGE were all based on Lucas Arts wanting SWG to reach a broader audience one that wouldnt be interested in a sandbox only game.Prior to WoW the best you could ever hope for was around k to at most million subscribers. SWG at its Zenith had about k subs.  Once another game showed the path to a casual untapped market then Lucas Arts was embarrassed that Star Wars wasnt doing as well in the same market and ordered the NGE.That was the cause of the changes. No amount of player complaining has ever altered business plans or a revision back to the old system would have happened based on those cries and subsequent massive subscription loss.Allowing people to voice their displeasure in a non commercial enterprise can lead to changes when the goal is to capture as much of the limited EMU population as possible.

At least for a uk player.Usually I find the servers with a low population are low because they offer nothing new compared to the other big servers however I can see rogue one appealing to those who want a longer term SWG experience rather than instant Jedi and easy loot.There is no reason why this server wont develop into a large server over the next year.,swgemu,d40ntob,1,t5_2rpa5

Do I fill your free time?Please dont flatter yourself I dont want your heaping pile of shit code except for your Jedi. Halo has done a wonderful job fucking up everything and I hope he enjoys that Frankenstein creation Fun fact he doesnt enjoy it because he hasnt played on his own server since Christmas time So no its not curious and you are once again making my post into something it is not. If you would like to read the unbiased opinion that I have you can do so here. Ask questions before you join a server otherwise you will stuck with someone like this guy making decisions and  hours of your life taken from you.  ,swgemu,d4fnnlu,1,t5_2rpa5
8016839,0,t1_d4h4g5p,gt Also how much do the faction points cost?Youll have two options donate k or k. k gets you  FP k gets you .gt  In that case do either of you think it would be worth it to go ahead and grind up the smuggler tree and just buy my faction points and transfer them to the toon I want them on? Well the answer to this lies in how delegation works which is the higher rank you are the better rates you have when transferring FP to another character. If your smuggler has only just joined the faction your transfer ratio is  meaning if you want to delegate  points youll need to have  above the nontransferable  FP minimum. The other character will receive the  points the remaining  will be lost.Not knowing what species your character is and from which recruiter youll buy the ATST lets assume that youre paying roughly k for it which is somewhere in the middle of the potential price range. If your smuggler joins the faction and ranks to corporal youll have a  delegate ratio which means youd need k faction to get k of it to your other character who will need to be a Sergeant for FP cap reasons. At k per  FP thats . million creds.But the delegate ratio is most favorable at colonel where the ratio is .. It costs about k FP to go from private to colonel so you can lower the total FP required to roughly k k to rank the smuggler up plus k. .k for delegating points and buying the ATST. Which lowers your overhead to . million creds.Finally assuming you instead found a smuggler who was already a colonel and didnt want to make any profit off of the venture youd be looking at about . million creds.My  cents worth is this. Based on my experience using defense stackers to both grind the weapons facility and for creds Id say you can hit about  mil creds doing lairs out of an IJM in a hour buff session and earn about k in the Weapons Development Facility on Naboo which in my experience is better FP gain than Imp. vs. Gungans. I dont know if your mileage may vary by server though.TLDR If you already know a smuggler whos a colonel and doesnt want to make money off of you buying the points and grinding for them are pretty much on the same footing. I wouldnt bother grinding a character up to smuggler unless your build doesnt hold up to the weapons facility or you have  million creds already lying around that youre content to spend on this.,swgemu,d4h612l,3,t5_2rpa5

8490805,0,t3_4vzy6g,Been a while since I played but the first few boxes can be a chore. Get the first couple of boxes killing the critters that are in the grassy area past the shuttle port youd see If you ran straight out of the starport in Theed. Dont use special attacks unbuffed or youre killing yourself through special attack cost sac can be reduced through food drink spice docent buffs and stat migrationYou may have better luck with meatlumps on outskirts of Coronet exit starport turn left who may also have some loot.Break up the monotony now and again buy running some survey missions on the artisan terminal there was an easy way to do that. I cant remember ranges but get a terminal at one side of a city run missions in direction of otherside of city run the appropriate distance plus a few meters scan for Everything and Keep waypoints for  above mission requirement. Then can run back and forth between resource waypoint and mission terminal I cant remember payout value but I think its  creds  missions should get enough for doc buffs.When feeling ready to step up your game Get some buffs and try running missions. Buffs usually available in Mos Eisley Theed and Coronet there may be player cities offering services also.From my last emu experience it seemed more productive to roam the wilderness killing random spawns of things While buffed once you have A reasonable damage increase but those first boxes were rough.,swgemu,d62wd8s,1,t5_2rpa5
8569088,0,t1_d6btfx8,Pre CU was probably the best version of SWG in terms of classes and how open a player was to do whatever they wanted like a true sandbox mmo.The NGE definitely put blinders on this and forced you to pidgeon hold yourself into a class and role that you could not deviate from just like WoW. I will say that towards the end of NGE the fast paced combat was definitely slightly more enjoyable for me especially for PVP but you were limited on choices of gear and what not. The NGE also added cool things to the game like new speeders new housing new ships new JTL content more crafting options etc. But it is still preference. ,swgemu,d6cptew,1,t5_2rpa5

9011290,0,t1_d7un548,gt If you can have a combat toon  entertainer  doctor online it can make a single player experience possible when there are not many people online.This is a sandbox MMO RPG that is completely dependent on player interaction and interdependence and dividing the community more and trying to promote a single player experience sounds counter productive to everything that SWG stands for.Im all for supporting developers and projects that have goals that exceed what SWG originally had to offer but why start another server? Why not join or help out one of the  other projects that already have  or  people playing? Why try and divide the community more? ,swgemu,d7v0lwc,4,t5_2rpa5

9867974,0,t1_dan6qyg,Im in the same boat as OP except I have played a few of the servers in the past. I have been missing the game and wanted to get back into it. I had some real issues with Bas in terms of all the high end loot was camped by  toons all on the same accounts all with the same macros with SB guns etc. There was  chance I could do anything other than help them take down an acklay faster or Ancient elder etc. Logged back in this week and still appears to be the same issue. With that and all those accounts also have a Master WSArmorerSmuggler etc. I felt all I was doing was playing the game by myself and for myself. Grind mission terms for build XP and cash now smaller payouts than before try to buy SB resources buy or hope to log in right after a server restart and take out a high end mob for a chance at high end lootresources. Make a weapon or armor that still isnt SB and wont sell to most. Rinse and repeat.  What am I missing? Cantinas and Med Centers are  AFK. I feel alone in an MMORPG. ,swgemu,dattiug,1,t5_2rpa5
