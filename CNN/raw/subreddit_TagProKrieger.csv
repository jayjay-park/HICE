4460901,0,t1_cssyeja,gtIts a good idea but the problem is that reddit wont support that feature forever.Ugh that sucks. gtI really want to make a filter for replays but I just dont know what to do for the long term. Do you have any ideas?Automatically? Not sure off the top of my head though I imagine its doable. Youre talking like a toggle to turn replay posts onoff right?Its definitely possible if people mods or users are manually assigning a replay link flair to their posts which is much simpler in a smaller sub like rTagProTesting but not so much for a larger one like rTagPro.You could definitely set it to autofilter all gfycat links since those are a max of  seconds but some people use vidme which doesnt have a time limit so you could inadvertently end up filtering out highquality montages as well. I dont believe there exists a method of automatically differentiating the two via CSS though if you constructed a bot insanely tedious probably more work than its worth I bet its possible.,TagProKrieger,cssz5vz,1,t5_35stg
