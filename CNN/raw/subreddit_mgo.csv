5300816,0,t3_3nklyx,Honestly i like how the game looks and i think its great theyre trying to make it similar to MGO with the goofiness but they removed so many key elements that were important. Everyone knows how special text chats and clan systems were to mgo they were what made the community feel more alive. Yes we have mics but half the people sit in private parties nowadays anyways. The server list browser was great because there would be rooms you join everyday meeting up with the same players and meeting new dudes. If the creatorsKonamiKJ LA whoever made this game were as passionate    as they say they would know how important these features mean to the player. MGO is where i met all my online pals BECAUSE of text chat BECAUSE of clans its what made it unique from other games.As a long time MGO player its super dissapointing. I hope to still enjoy it but its hard to not be saddened by the lack of basic features.,mgo,cvp8o7p,2,t5_2s9k3

5316044,0,t1_cvr5xfr,The sprinting is quite a bit slower compared to the upgraded run speed of Snake in the single player but I dont sprint too much online so that doesnt bother me Im more bothered by the weird camera angle they went for when psrinting instead of the default one thats in the single player. Why change it to some slightly zoomed in thing? The single player sprint camera was fine.

5316249,0,t1_cvr7gnw,It may not be as effective as MGO but as a Scout during Cloak and Dagger one of the key give aways to spot someone in Camo is the massive and very obvious shadow they still cast off.Up close it is easy to just spot their shimmer but from a distant you need to watch out for moving shadows.With that in mind when you are sneaking in Camo making sure your shadow is always covered with other shadows takes that huge flaw away immediately. ,mgo,cvr7ovp,2,t5_2s9k3

5322148,0,t3_3nognt,Well I had a great time yesterday but I tried playing today and it was an absolute nightmare. I sat there joining match after match after match only to have it tell me Ive disconnected before joing or even one match where right in the middle the host disconnected. I tried to use join game instead of the quick match mode but whenever I would try and join it would tell me its full even when the server would show  all the way down the list. When I finally managed to join a match I was paired up against someone whos already a fucking level  who smoked our entire team alone twice so I decided to join another match in which ended up being a comm match where the entire team moved to the same link instead of just defending so whenever Id defend Id get the shit kicked out of my by a walker gear and two other dudes. Ive never been mad enough to throw a controller but I finally managed to do it today. I think the games alot of fun but for my own health Im going to wait on playing it until its a bit more patched up.,mgo,cvrysyq,1,t5_2s9k3

I recorded some great footage of both and I will post links as soon as I upload it.  There are plenty of things to bitch about when it comes to MGO but the Walker gear is not one of them. People who complain about the Walker gear dont know how to use it or counter it and are too lazy to figure it out.

You realize this suggests you are the one of the worst players?That said that is a good point. There is absolutely no argument you can make that there is a class easier than the Titan in Destiny. In the Beta the Hunter was fine and the health differences were fine. It was actually an even fight between all the classes. But then the trash players who couldnt stand getting killed by an invisible character because invisibility so they bitched about it. Despite the fact that the Hunters abilities are all skill shots and the Titans abilities are all idiot friendly. So they completely rebalanced the health system and the PVP has been completely broken since.gt Weapons and classes getting nerfed to oblivion because kids arent able to get a kill every ten seconds through a few button presses. And now the enforcer is the only character who can do that.gt Especially on games like CoD if your feet werent moving when you got a kill youre a camper. Because youre a camper lol. In call of duty its all about holding down an area not a position. Its about zoning and you cant zone if you stay in one spot.gt Patience is no longer an option is games if you are patient youre a noob Jew fag.You dont need to bring homophobic bullshit in here. That said patience is definitely an option in games. Its just different in every game. Call of Duty requires little patience on rare occasions to be successful.

And a game like CounterStrike requires a perfect balance of everything.gt One guy posted a video of himself outsmarting an enemy by hitting the dirt and shimmying down a short wall and surprising the guy.

The exact same argument you are making here? Yea it was made several times prepatch talking about infiltrators just like you are now. I cant help but wonder how youd respond to those threads.As for the balance itself its impossible to know this early how well balanced everything is. The rebalance completely changed how people play as the infiltrator and made being a scount easier along with making the enforcer easier which was already the easiest class in the first place. I cant stand threads like this. People were making threads prepatch saying Stop saying the game is shit there is a difference between constructive criticism and being rude. And there was a ton of push back from illiterate morons saying There is nothing wrong with constructive criticism. It was embarrassing to say the least. But now here we have you saying Stop giving constructive criticism. Yet somehow you have upvotes? lolgt  the worst players are usually the loudest. The fact that you are getting upvoted for suggesting the developer ignore constructive criticism proves that.gt Dont screw the people that want whats best for the game not whats best for their KD.

If  you havent unlocked cqc then I would use cqc fulton and interrogation but again if you are really adamant about fultons try cqc and fulton . As far as tips you just need to take your time practice your headshots and know your surroundings. Always have an exit  somewhere you can run and hide in case you get caught. Use smoke grenades to your advantage whether it be to give you cover fake out the enemy by throwing it to B and going for A or to shield you balloon when you fulton someone. Also make sure you check the platforms before you advance ahead because sometimes teammates plant plushies and cannons near one or another so you know that one is a little safer to run to once you have the target,mgo,cyup8zw,1,t5_2s9k3

6237356,0,t3_40yb5i,I had this exact issue. The way I fixed it personally was by setting MGSVMGO.exe and MGSVTPP.exe to run as administrator in the preferences for the files. For me setting MGSVMGO.exe to administrator mode was NOT enough. Try to make sure that both files are checked in administrator mode. Sorry if it doesnt work for you. I struggled for hours with this until I tried to set the other exe to admin as well.I am windows  bit and I did not use compatibility mode.P.S. Do not try to launch the game from MGSVMGO.exe. It will not work even if you run as administrator it needs the original client to run.

6243025,0,t1_cyz8zd2,I suppose for the URAGAN that is sufficient. It always irks me that scouts are allowed to have it but youve addressed that. I mean a class that excels at long range has essentially the anti infiltrator gun. Ive had scouts turn around and knock me down when im . seconds from CQCing em its not fair especially when they can no scope pretty easily now. People complain the Inf was OP lol.Firefight from a mechanic point of view would partly be enemies near by and also weapons being fired. As in if a weapon has been fired in xx m away from your buddy your buddy has taken bullet damage in xx seconds or a bullet has landed? Not the right word but meh within xx meters of your buddy in xx seconds.If there is an enemy at each spawn point then they should be dynamically shifted to secondary points. Spawning in the middle of a firefight incredibly disrupting to the flow of the gameplay. In my opinion anyway,mgo,cyz9ib7,1,t5_2s9k3

The enforcer has a shield oh wait what gun is best for taking care of that? As for elocators use your boxes. People are going to mark you one way or another.I just dont understand what you want and I dont think you do either. A perfect game where people are just sneaking and using CQC?

6530894,0,t1_czubgk7,I agree that there is both help and hurt but I disagree with you on how much hurt there is. It looks to me like AA affects the horizontal aim a lot stronger than the vertical so if your aim starts high youre likely to get some headshots in. Recoil and a bit of upward aim is enough to get headshots on burst firing too. You lose some headshots but definitely not all of the close quarters headshots.The advantage from AA will shrink when they reduce the camera shake from taking damage since getting those first body shots in will save you on fewer occasions. From memory they were also reducing body shot damage which would also help. Time will tell if it levels the playing field.,mgo,czuugw1,1,t5_2s9k3

Its been met by stiff resistance from players that say A it makes no sense for projectiles to gain damage over time its a video game man why not make the sniper rifle actually good at long range or B it is not conducive to skill quickscoping instead of sniping.

Way I see it its actually pretty advantageous to Fulton the missile as well as shoot it so you can effectively split the enemies in two.

I mean if its networking  it should pop up in the first book I pull up but it doesnt. It seems like quite a specific things to talk about.Stating its basic knowledge is bullshit if it ISNT in the first  books I pull up when i search via google scholar or when I pull up a book on how routers route their traffic. I mean Im not currently studying a networking course persay Im studying digital forensics and network analysis is one of the modules but its something Id expect should have been brought up if thats as standard on every router as it could fuck with an investigation if youre only looking for external traffic on a network and the person connecting via their own IP which automatically routes to another computer elsewhere on the LAN wouldnt be in the filter for external traffic. Im genuinely interested in this.So yeah When you say Stop trying to correct First youre wrong since Im correcting him on stating that he shouldnt immediately discredit him for saying its not LAN Its not. The game isnt based fully in a local area network without Konamis matchmaking server you wouldnt be able to connect Its not LAN Im not trying to correct him on his router statement Im trying to ascertain this information which states that any outbound connection to a host that has the same IP as the source host doesnt first hop onto an External node. Saying I dont need to read a book to know what this guys saying is correct I dont need to read a book to understand his statement I just want some theory to backup his statement if its Networking  it should be in every single book when you talk about the subject. Its all fine and good saying North Korea has Unicorns and thats common knowledge but without proof the statement falls flat.Stop being such an asshole as to people asking for proof Youre just trying to insult my intelligence and make my argument seem false by stating you already know this and its basic knowledge All Im asking is you provide this basic knowledge for me from a reputable source and so far all thats been done is bashing.

7079625,0,t1_d1imc0b,The first part is a great counter against spawn camping and the second would actually make spawn camping easier since you could just wait it out on their HQ and trap the routes leading to the conflict zone.Anyhow I believe the point of the idea was not to move the general combat area but to force players to travel there instead of spawning there. That way they can be ambushed by Infiltrators or sniped  marked by Scouts more easily.Amber Station fights usually take place near the stairs leading to the underground. Black Site turns the middle hangars into a slaughterhouse. Grey Rampart usually focuses on the sandy area above the river or on the river spawnpoints themselves. Alternatively it focuses on the left dam spawn. In all of those cases its like that because spawnpoints are too close to each other or in case of the dam spawn point its super easy to defend and camp at. Simply moving and replacing some of them would go a long way on these maps.,mgo,d1iu9ic,1,t5_2s9k3

8889608,0,t1_d7gege0,Again the point is lost. Let me try again. Whatever you come up with and believe is wellreasoned has been spawned in your echo chamber of a very limited player base. There is no way you are going to just make an objectively better game when you are doing so with your own personal bias of what your team values. You dont get to be the gatekeeper to the game that people sign in to play. You could have avoid all this shitstorm by being a actual human and showing sympothy to the guy who complained about the mod fucking with his auto match but NO you had to double down and say Basically what it amounts to is either download the mod yourself and avoid playing what is truly a terrible game.

Especially with the upvoting system in place. The problem is when he decided that the answer to people having problems with people using the mod in automatch was play my mod or fuck off. If some how you are implying that I am a part of the echo chamber against the mod that is created from a echo chamber both being equally pointless I would like to bring your focus to the fact that his actions are having a negative effect on people trying to enjoy their purchased content. Where his positives only lie in the experience being tailored into more what he believes it should be. Having a echo chamber create balance changes that you try to forceably muscle the community into and having a echo chamber shame a guy who releases a client side mod in a multiplayer game are two VERY different things. ,mgo,d7ghy0e,1,t5_2s9k3

10419047,0,t3_5p62m3,So many to list so Ill have to categorize them in a kind of timeline eraThe  . EraWhen E.Locs had insane range and people got marked unfairly and as a result people like myself as a Scout main tried to abstain away from using them but little did we know we scraped the tip of the iceberg in terms of BS like Underbarrel Demo Camo and Optics of now. Serval also was considered the most OP gun and at the time it was with its insane damage and hell even a ricochet effect wasnt uncommon amongst other things.The rMGO eraTime went on and rMGO had started studying and looking into interesting thenunknown research for titles on what caused them to appear under what exact conditions I credit MGO Weirdish for providing countless research into this he provided so many spreadsheets with players contribution and this research helped people to achieve titles such as Hound Dober etc. The rMGO Era also looked to studying what worked well with what such as Sniper and Lethal Aim mixed together for example. This same era brought up people to prominence like Sentiel aka uZansacu and rising star at the time Professor Khai aka uKhaitalflash on the MGO YouTube scene.The ESL EraESL started becoming a thing in MGO at the time with prize money and rare stuff on the stakes with people like NishiRevolutioN ThePurestOneEncrypted and Gen SnakeRevenant started dominating the scene. Now ESL on MGO is virtually non existent but the current rMGO tournaments bring the veterans back but also for anyone to play.rMGO Attitude EraNow time for my own moment at first when I started on MGO and for a long time I was known Doctor Doc Con which I am still called by a few of my old friends and this sub reddit made me join Reddit in the first place. At the time when I was green in a greenish period of MGO I started posting videos here but I had mixed reviews good but cocky or just a boring randomer with good gameplay so I decided turn an aspect of my personality purposely up to  into a persona TSG an incredibly cocky bastard still am clue was in TheStrongestGamer which was really to piss people off like how Rocky Maivia Dwayne Johnson became The Rock shoutout to rSquaredCircle and it got more attention but obviously it attracted heat but it got people talking hell its how I got into Sentiels clique originally and instead of a clique of good players such as Joaomaseratti XFadedstrength aka Cutlass and ChampuCheti aka uRetardedRhino  I formed alot of friendships in there to this day theyre my brothers and I thank this sub reddit on how to develop character rather than someone who just plays MGO and having a brotherhood.Then it started downfallingThe SurvivalSabotage EraIn my opinion this was the last great era of MGO finally a way to fight clans as a part of clan but it was flawed from the start and still flawed with the same issues hackers are running rampant Team Solid bullshit etc. This is when people started leaving MGO by the numbers.The Modern EraFast forward to present but Im gonna end it on a positive note the rMGO events I corun with Professor Khai have helped to revitalize MGO even though its a day we always have full rooms with veterans always returning while providing commentary with Khai on his stream and semi regulars Sentiel and ugensnake which has attracted the eyes and ears of Konami but the focus the community. We dont expect anything and frankly I see this as volunteering for the community and with  viewers at the SAME time  we even outdo popular titles such as Overwatch which is crazy. Even though I approached Professor Khai with the idea to become a cohosted event for the community by the community I have to credit uFlashmedallion for helping us out with it when he could of brushed it off and after being once temporary moderator of this sub he helped me out in becoming more of a business thinker.This is my metacommunity favourite moments,mgo,dcp2foy,7,t5_2s9k3

10532689,0,t3_5qqqua,well there is no other way to describe some aspects of the game. I could go into specific problems and carefully dodge those problematic words that hurt feelings but in the end the general problem could be just described as X is bad and so can be described almost every other aspects of the game.if they cant handle negative criticism they shouldnt be making games. ALL communities are like that voicing their complaints aggressively and dropping swears. but this one is much less aggressiveangry than others take a look at starcraft  forums everytime the dev team posts what theyve planned for the future and compare it to how this community was youd be surprised because we acted rather nicely and Im sure the SC community is not the worst by far.Im not here to tell the devs that everything will be fine and well do a big group hug if they fail. I wanted the game to be in a better state.,mgo,dd1zw0e,4,t5_2s9k3

11082319,0,t3_5y999s,Honestly thats one of the things keeping me from going full hype about the return to the official firmware. And Konami surely didnt gain a good reputation with the whole Kojima and Silent Hill fiasco. I guess only time will tell if they still care. Great post btw.,mgo,deo6621,4,t5_2s9k3

11712090,0,t1_dgnl3yz,Yup the box. Its been a trick to numerous Metal Gear titles. If you ever find yourself on fire equip the C.Box. The problem with doing this in MGO though is the fire does way too much damage too quickly. Most of the time even if you manage to equip the box youll still die.,mgo,dgnlfd8,4,t5_2s9k3
