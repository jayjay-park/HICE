1138840,0,t1_chxpwyx,A rock would be perfect as long as it elevates it closer up towards the top but not close enough that the glass warps the light away from it. Keep it centered as it is so it doesnt get moisture from the glass. Too much moisture will still cause the fungi to break from the symbiosislichen structure so let it air out every other day and try not to overwater it.I have one in a larger jar on top of a piece of barkstick that has remained half lichen and half fungi for close to five months now despite being lidded and overwatered usually the fungi eats through it at a good pace once it gets a hold. Best advice if you see it start to die around the edges or sprout white strands is try to remove that bit. Some mosses can stand a spritz of rice vinegar which kills fungi but lichen can usually survive if there is a sudden burst of fungi.Very jealous of that jar btw!! Heres what I do with sticks that have lichen for if you ever find a good one  gotta put the sticks at an angle against the glass though rot over time will cause straight ones to break too fast. ,terrariums,chxqayh,2,t5_2s0sb

1897116,0,t3_2gbsd0,I like it  Its really pretty but may I suggest that in your next one you should have fewer plants. Ive been making terrariums for a while now and the ones that have lasted are the ones with fewer plants. Also bigger jars are better in closed terrariums and go easy on the water in closed jars as the plants and microbes start to eat everything more water will be released into the jar and it might get so wet that it saturates everything and the plants die. Keep up the good work!,terrariums,ckhsjsw,1,t5_2s0sb

3105785,0,t1_cojw84h,Thanks!  The big tank is pretty awesome!  I did not build it though.  I do know that it has cork bark half rounds as a background with miss in between that the creeping fig is growing on.  I would assume that the cork rounds were held to the background with great stuff.  It has been growing in pretty well. ,terrariums,cojww5w,1,t5_2s0sb

3409922,0,t3_2z6bio,Be careful with keeping it covered outside. The sun will cook them. Its probably much better to just put them in a regular pot with sphagnumpeat and leave them outside in the sun. Youll run into problems with heat and fungus by covering them.Also the nondormant VFT you have looks kind of sun starved. Be careful on moving it into sunlight.,terrariums,cpgyfqx,1,t5_2s0sb
3686470,0,t1_cqccs95,Yeah really the only thing that can self sustain in an environment like that is mosslichen and even then it has to have activated charcoal present so that it can filter out the airtoxins. ,terrariums,cqchdbu,1,t5_2s0sb

4641988,0,t3_3dtaj1,Try and use rain water and or distilled water. Tap water has a lot of minerals which will build up over time and cause problems for the moss. ,terrariums,ctfot3u,1,t5_2s0sb
4729083,0,t1_ctqmpyt,I havent looked into anything from Petsmart  I might actually try Java Fern!

4747056,0,t1_ctscvtj,Huh I have a sealed terrarium that only consists of moss and a couple plants that are like clovers. Been sealed since November of  although I did only use distilled water and let much of it evaporate to get that perfect level. ,terrariums,ctswtln,2,t5_2s0sb
4869319,0,t1_cu0d7df,I actually just took it down and released the toadies back into the wild so they can fatten up before winter.  I was worried about finding bugs small enough for them to eat they are very small toads! over the winter so it was time to let them go. The mosses I found around my home from the bases of trees were doing quite well but the peat bog moss turned a little yellowish and was not as happy in spite of the peat substrate and high moisture at that end. The pool in the end was filled with the cricket quencher jelly all broken up and I caught a toad lounging in the goop so it must have been nice enough for him.  I would add water when I couldnt see any around the pieces of gel and the crickets couldnt drown so it worked pretty well I think. I got a grow light meant to fit on top of a planted fish tank and that definitely improved the situation.  I did  hours on and it was nearish a window with some natural light to wake everyone up first thing in the morning. ,terrariums,cu8bc92,1,t5_2s0sb

I stacked slate bits with some glue to help hold them together mostly just stacked though and have a pump behind the stack moving water up to the top where it comes out and trickles down.  The hard part is distributing the water evenly across the top.  Then I just stuck java moss and baby tears etc across it.,terrariums,dcixc4h,2,t5_2s0sb

Where I DONT suck is aquatic aquarium plants and the reason for that is that Ive done a lot of reading.So my advice to you would be to go out there and do some reading. Go to your local library and look up terrarium books. Google good terrarium book or terrarium guide and you can find forums with people talking about good book titles. Thats my advice. Do a lot of reading!,terrariums,dgcwu0k,1,t5_2s0sb
