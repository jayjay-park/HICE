Remember distinctly when I asked as a kid whether I can just screw the whole thing and be happy with hell and my parents said that my sin will affect their shot at heaven and I should keep that in mind. Their love for me never really felt quite the same after that and it still fucks me up greatly in many ways.Not dealing with it too well at the moment but its great to see a sub for this!,ExChristianWomen,d70z37m,4,t5_3g2f0
10116305,0,t1_dbpg3ez,gtI was never afraid to be different from other peopleThe same here oddly given the tone of what I wrotegtI was very anxious and upset about how my friends and family would be disappointed and heartbroken that I wouldnt meet their expectations.I feel the same. The more contact I have with them the more the sense of disappointment I feel. Its also crazy because I never intended to make an issue of it or come out to them if they think Im going to hell well its just easier for me to let them believe Im still saved than try to deconvert them from their perspective if you know what I mean but I was sort of outed about my unbelief and also being queer and I think that sort of embarrassment can really disorganize a person mentally. I have been out for over a decade but to be honest I think a lot of my grief and other feelings about this are still here because there were some events that put my life rebuilding and grieving process on hold. Its good to be around exchristians though. I was around an exchristian woman this week and it helps me to know that Im not alone in feeling like a disappointment.gtIf anything it helped me shead a lot of guilt and shame over leaving the faith  I only have one life and I have to make the best of it and live a life I can be proud of.I agree with that perspective too.I hear you on it not being one event that made you leave. To be honest I think it also looks different in retrospect in the immediate aftermath you are aware of the logical discrepancies that made you leave but further off I find I notice other things which I think were more at the root of my attachment to religion.,ExChristianWomen,dbq5uuq,1,t5_3g2f0
