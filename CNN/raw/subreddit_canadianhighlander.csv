8490623,0,t1_d5wcnv0,i believe evolution only lets you grab  cmc not  so you cannot sac a  drop to get FTK. All in all evolution seems fantastic in the highlander format so long as you are heavy on creatures. Ive been testing with it in Birthing Pod shells alongside chord of calling. Very powerful card. ,canadianhighlander,d62vjmf,1,t5_3a9bf
