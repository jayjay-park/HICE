6515286,0,t3_44oh3k,Its all about variable scope. Example    var myVar    Public variable    function doSomething                  myVar    Still public new value set publicly is         var yourVar    Private variable. Using var establishes it as a new variable        function doSomethingElse          var myVar  Hello          This is a new private variable. myVar is still equal to  outside of this function. Inside it is equal to Hello.    Where you declare a variable determines that variables scope. A private variable one defined within a function or object cannot be used outside of that function or object.A good policy while coding is to keep as many variables private as possible. It keeps the global scope clean. Global scope is variables defined at the root of the document exposed to all functions andor objects.It might be good to run through Codecademy or repeat earlier FCC lessons if you feel unsure about variable scope.,FreeCodeCamp,czt8cgt,1,t5_34mfx

Students can also attend Advanced Placement AP classes which are College Prep classes and in which you can earn a higher overall credit to your Grade Point Average GPA.   High School is  years. After graduating High School you may apply to a Jr. College for a  year Associates degree pretty much worthless or to College or University theyre basically the same thing for a  year Bachelors degree in a major of your choice.  After receiving a Bachelors degree you can do a  years Master degree or a  year Doctorate PHd. There is no American equivalent to an O or A level schooling.  All students are legally required to complete schooling through th grade although some students may drop out or seek a GED which is roughly equivalent to a high school diploma. There are no tests to be admitted to High School nor during it to stay in.  Basically if you have a pulse and have shown up to most of your classes in middle school you will be admitted to high school.  The same is true for Jr. College.    There are also no exams at the end of High School except for those in your senior year classes.In my estimation if you have passed your O or A level exams you are likely better educated than the vast majority of American students of the same age.  Our public education system kinda stinks.,FreeCodeCamp,d0oxfh1,1,t5_34mfx

10128166,0,t3_5kz661,Incredible job. Very clean and I love the sections that show your projects. The one thing that wasnt perfect that I noticed was that when I made the browser window small the word Callahan wasnt centered anymore. That being said its looking great! ,FreeCodeCamp,dbrpf7n,5,t5_34mfx

10252610,0,t3_5mtevv,So this is my first website made because of the tribute page assignment. I used this more like a playground to play with bootstrap than for serious content. Also i used github right away since id like to get more experienced in using it.Its not perfect and fully functional but its a start and i gained alot from it. For my next step Ill skip the portfolio page part and go to JS.Also what Ill change in my next website is to do the content first in NotepadWord then doing a simple design sketch before i do the coding this was all done on the go so it took probably more time then it would if i prepared better. Also since im new to this Im still in the process of gathering resources and ideas.Its not my first time with HTML and CSS Ive tried codeacademy before but I always quit when i got to JS. Hope it wont be like that this time. Im also getting Jon Ducketts books next week hopefully. I really like the idea of a carrier change p.s. English is not my native language so Im sorry for my grammar S,FreeCodeCamp,dc66u3n,2,t5_34mfx

11052124,0,t3_5xcs8f,I tried using navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition but found that it would not work with codepen.io because they are not using   I switched to the ipapi.comjson API and it all worked.
