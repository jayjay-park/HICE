Im thinking it had to have a fresh wood blade in it with a near optimal tooth count whatever that may be for muscle and bone. Im not sure why you think it would take a lot of strength to cut? I imagine it would cut like like green wood. The fuck am I saying.,CrimeScene,d6e8dwv,8,t5_3ftqz

These are the cases the death penalty should be applied in and I cant understand how she escaped it or was ever seen as eligible for parole. These types of people can never be rehabilitated its just not possible.It absolutely baffles me. Theres people who are executed for accidentally running over cops in chases or sitting in a car while their accomplice commits a robbery and shoots someone but people like this walked free. Unbelievable. ,CrimeScene,d6zkunq,1,t5_3ftqz

8870723,0,t3_51r7xm,Despite not being born at the time Ive always known about this case because my mom worked for Channel  News when this incident happened. She has a lot of stories about the gory stuff shes seen but this one always made her really mad. One of her favorite things to say when a highprofile crime happens in Reno is get ol Priscilla out there with her Lincoln and run the sumbitch the criminal over.Edit I forgot about this I was going to put it in the imgur description but here might be better.

8920327,0,t1_d7k39ef,Lots of people think this to be fake but its just the state in which her body is in! Being in the water can do that and I think her face has stayed slightly more in tact than the rest of her body because of all the bugs living in her mouth. Very sad. ,CrimeScene,d7k3cnm,2,t5_3ftqz
8927768,0,t1_d7kxbdq,I thought she had slut her wrists and just had a necklace on going from the last time I looked I cant look again right now. I guess I just have to check them on my computer instead of my phone to see the fixture properly.I really just thought from the presumed before photo that she was quite slim and thats all bloat and water displacement which would cause it to be all over the floor but also not as noticeable as two weeks of the faucet being on.

Obviously you cant do much if theyre turning to goo but say great uncle John Doe dies alone in his home and his family doesnt find him for a week or more. Would you still be able to embalm him or does it turn into a closed casket get him in the ground asap situation?Also what happens to everything that comes out of the body blood fats fluids etc? Does it just get washed down a drain or does it have to be disposed of in a specific manner?,CrimeScene,d7n6f8t,25,t5_3ftqz
8955180,0,t1_d7o9al6,Yes. I was involved in that case on the union side employee representation so I dont know any of the investigative portion. The decedent was mentally ill either through pharmaceutical means or biological and attacked an innocent man. The officer that defended that man and took the life of his attacker was affected greatly by the incident. This is my biggest beef when it comes to the medias interpretation of the police. Cops dont get into shootings every day and just go back to work. It is an incredibly traumatizing experience that follows you for life.    ,CrimeScene,d7oa1iv,27,t5_3ftqz

10098504,0,t3_5kf6qm,Hello all! I have some questions about possible career options in forensics and schooling. Ive been pondering this for awhile now and have a lot of thoughts in my head. Im on moble though so bare with me.I am just now realizing I have a real interest in the medical field. As a child I can remember always having a slightly morbid curiosity. In girl scouts when everyone shyed away from a dead snake on our hike I was the one who tentivly eyed the organs surprised to find that they were blue. Though I was also a very timid child and still am. Which is why Im sceptical about my interest in this field. In high school I adored both psychology and forensics. But when i took anatomy i was too scared to dysect a pig and dropped the course half way through the year. I was also pulling a whopping D average but I digress I realize that these classes were just snippets of what I would be learning in any path I choose to persue and that excites me. I have lots of different broad interests like the psyche of killers what makes them able to do what they do. Serial killers are what Ive spent a lot of free time reading up about with very light dabbling in the criminal justice field as well. I have a lot of other interests like rare diseases cases of humans surviving when no man thought they could human experimentation animal behavioralism I could go on. Though with all of this comes lots of insecurities and questions I cant answer. For instance I can look at a dead body online just fine Ive been to funerals and felt fine witnessing the dead but Ive never seen an actual cadaver in real life. I have a sensitive stomach especially to smells. Can I handle seeing a corpse on the scene of a crime? Could I calmly question a convicted killer for a look into their mind? Im a  tall creme puff how are these people going to view me? I love watching Dr Sandra Lee work but could I be steady handed enough when pus is flying at me to do a good job?I would really appreciate any help or advice!,CrimeScene,dbnul4n,3,t5_3ftqz
