6079340,0,t1_cyfdoww,Thanks. I sometimes feel like I am being a bad spouse. Like maybe I should be more loving or whatever. More emotionally present. More caring. But then I go back to my journal and remind myself it is just me adapting to the situation. Hard to like someone when they treat you bad. Ive thought this about her but it is the first time Ive heard someone else say it. She is not going to change. It is who she is. She is broken at her core. Thanks for that.,verbalabuse,cyghgmz,2,t5_2yr8p
