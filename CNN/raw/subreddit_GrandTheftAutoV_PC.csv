They saw that a delay was necessary to make the game not terrible for PC. So they pushed it to the next fiscal year as thats the most beneficial for themgreedy K and gave them MORE then enough time.

3711335,0,t1_cqfampq,gt And even if they did understand theres no reason you cant just type normally instead of pressing ctrlv.The reason is that there are likely thousands of other people with various issues. You are not a special snowflake and you are not the only one worthy of support. If there was a solution to your problem theyd probably have a copypaste solution ready for it in this case its very evident that they dont so they give you the runofthemill standard troubleshooting instructions.This is not the fault of the supporter. This isnt because hes not taking your problem seriously nor is it because hes slacking off on his job. This is because he is likely way over capacity being assigned hundreds of different support cases at once  the problem is Rockstar Games. He likely has no choice but to have a various range of prewritten responses ready or there would be no way he could get through the mountains of requests. Do you realize that typing a unique response for every customer with a problem would lead to massive response times? Going off on the guy like you did after he told you theyd look into the issue and you can be pretty sure that there is now an entry in the Rockstar bug tracker if it wasnt there already from someone who had the same issue previously was completely unnecessary.Dont hate the player hate the game.

Hed go in passive mode but the people he spawned didnt go passive i assume because of mod files. So he drove around went out of passive shoots you and goes back to passiveness while his army deals with you. I found a way around this though. He needs a few seconds to turn go back to passive and spawn mobs. Since he can only spawn  at a time and takes a few seconds before spawning  more. So I just got  my marksman rifle and mowd down the spawns  at a time. He would try and move to a different spawn to spawn but I just followed and repeat.

Now you might think that you could just automatically clean up the unused stuff for that program but you cant because you as a third party dont have any idea what the program needs to keep and what is just hanging around pointlessly wasting space.So whatever this utility is doing its not fixing memory leaks. Its doing something generic regarding Windows memory management like making it take pages out of RAM and put them in the disk swapfile. Generally this is not what you want  RAM is fast and you want to make as much use of it as necessary amp possible.I cant explain why it produces a performance improvement for some commenters  its complicated  but this is not necessarily a good answer to anything.,GrandTheftAutoV_PC,cqwyt6i,56,t5_3206b

3913473,0,t3_356kgs,I dont think the mods are unlocked per class i did everything with my Entity and have mods for every class.However the win system means you either have to be really good or trade wins to get the performance parts. Like you said its a vicious cycle. The better driver gets better part which with he can win even easier while the ones struggling to come up first dont get anything to boost their performance and level the field.IMO id like to see the daily objectives to change to Win race instead of participate and the performance mods to unlock just by participating.My racing stats are about  wins   lost and i been playing race sims since release of GT forza GT and f series. So i imagine grinding for race wins is even worse for people that dont enjoy racing as much.

4184368,0,t3_38qcj7,I have a macbook pro from  iQM with intel integrated and an AMD m with gb VRAM. I can run the game fine on normallow settings the thing is since I run windows . through bootcamp the intel card is ignored and only the AMD card is used for graphics. ie dedicated become only card integrated is not used. If you can get into your BIOS on a normal windows machine waaay easier than on a mac machine then you should be able to change the default GPU Im not  certain and this is risky as your BIOS is critical and messing with it can be dangerous.I had some issues when I first installed in the game though and thats because my drivers wouldnt update work around is after the extraction of the original .exe you can find the AMD folder and manually install the display drivers. This fixed a ton of graphical issues and improvedstabilized my frame rate a lot.I used the beta drivers . and now am on . these drivers are better for GTAVVerify your game files through steam after you install to make sure it did it right and also make sure you have large enough page filefree ram.

Yes it looked worse because I already had quite a few settings on high and very high there is a noticeable difference between  and  at the screen size and distance I play at and I was already using the highest textures in both cases anyway. You will never convince me that its worth cutting your texture resolution to increase your final display resolution because it just isnt. You can render a fucking terapixel image that will still look like shit if your textures are low resolution.

But two patches ago the game was totally unplayable for me. It may be any combination of factors ranging from hardware type manufacturer driver version installed OS updates et cetera.It is up to Rockstar to determine what the problem is and make the appropriate modifications to the game engine to solve the issue from their end.

Under Properties go into the Advanced tab. Theres a dropdown box tagged Default format. Collapse it and click  bit  Hz CD Quality. Save the changes and exit out of it.   Reinstall DirectX from here even if you think you already have the latest version.   Make sure every nonessential USB device is not plugged in. So you should only really have your keyboard mouse and perhaps your headphones plugged in.   Navigate to CProgram Files xSteamsteamappscommonGrand Theft Auto V and rightclick GTAVLauncher.exe. Click Properties and open the Compatibility tab. Tick the box tagged Run this program as an administrator. This step is only for the Steam version of the game  I dont know what the Warehouse versions game root directory is. You also must be logged onto an administrator account.   In the same directory as the above step in the Compatibility tab of GTAVLauncher.exes Properties try setting the game to run in compatibility mode for Windows . If this step doesnt work revert it back afterwards.   Verify the games cache. I dont know how to do this on the Warehouse version but for Steam versions rightclick the game in your library and click Properties. Go to the Local Files tab and there youll see a button tagged Verify integrity of game cache... Hit that and let it do its thing. Itll take a while so get comfortable.   Make sure all relevant programs runtimes and drivers nVidia drivers Windows updates DirectX Steam etc. are all up to date.   If using the Steam version of the game disable the ingame Steam Overlay. You can do this by opening Steam and navigating to View gt Settings gt InGame and unticking the box tagged Enable the Steam Overlay while ingame.   Navigate to CWindowsSystem and find a file called DDX.dll. Append .backup to the extension so the file becomes DDX.dll.backup just incase this step breaks something. Then find out if youre running a bit or bit version of Windows. If youre running a bit version download this file. If youre running a bit version download this one. Put the new DDX.dll file you just downloaded into the System folder effectively replacing the original one you just backed up. Also copy the new DLL file into the games root directory.Make sure youre restarting your computer after all or even each of these steps.Hope this helps!,GrandTheftAutoV_PC,ctmjj01,0,t5_3206b

And in free mode I havent seen a masskill from the day the new anticheat system became active. Friends have seen them though.Overall I would say its a huge improvement compared to a few weeks ago.  Admins on the nmenu forum advice people to uninstall it and that menu is used by most griefers. So if those guys start given that advice even to their VIPmembers that paid  for it I guess thats a good indication things are much better for us legit players than before.

Copy your update folder into the mods folder. The copy of the update folder is the one you want to install mods into now. Same steps as usual just in the copy. Now when youre done installing the mod and whatnot youll want to rebuild your files. Its an OpenIV feature that essentially eliminates any errors that could have occurred during the install process. You can find it under the file tab in edit mode. Youll want to select any folder that you installed a new mod into to rebuild. Again all within the mods folder. Hope this makes sense and helps!

The issue that I have which is slight but annoying to me is kind of hard to explain but here goes There is a box around my character sort of like a render distance that makes things that are less detailed get more detailed as I get closer. This box is always facing one direction I presume its north and is really close to my character about a cars distance away. It is very noticeable on highways or on railings that are casting shadows. I always thought this was AF but when I was messing with it I could notice the difference and I dont think this is my issue.Im not super savvy on graphics and how their aspects so if you have any more advice on how I can fix this let me know.,GrandTheftAutoV_PC,czk4vxw,1,t5_3206b

With digital controls youre either full throttle or no throttle but no throttle doesnt mean your car instantly comes to a stop and full throttle doesnt mean your car instantly reaches top speed.So if you alternate between full throttle and no throttle you can maintain an approximate speed.  Press W to accelerate to your desired speed.  When you reach your desired speed depress W. The vehicles builtup momentum will allow it to maintain its speed for a moment before it begins slowing down. When the vehicle begins slowing down press W again for a moment to build up more momentum and maintain your speed.   Continue pressing and depressing W quickly to maintain your speed.The ratio of pressed to depressed varies based on your desired speed. Typically the faster youre going the greater the ratio i.e. youre pressing W longer than not.,GrandTheftAutoV_PC,d0gq1zn,0,t5_3206b

8497705,0,t1_d63r77d,Thanks for the extensive reply.  I already been modding the game for quite a while I installed plenty of cars some scripts etc.  I also have some graphical mods so Im not completely new. p  So yeah I already have scripthook and Ive been using some trainers but after an update a little while ago one month? the game started crashing and even deleting the trainers wouldnt repair the game   I had to reinstall the game quite a few times because I messed up something but then I got it back working.  BUT after installing the first mods I start from the graphic ones Im using NaturalVision I proceeded to install a couple of cars that I knew were  working because I used them previously AND the Enhanced Native Trainer love it!!  I remember the game worked once and then the next time I tried to launch it it started crashing upon loading the story mode.  Deleting the trainers asi fixed the issue so Im even more confused...reading on the website page I saw a few people saying that it was broken so I assumed the trainer wasnt updated for the latest patch..  Now youre confirming that it still works so I dont really know what to do.  For now Ill try and find the safest way to mod the game and be able to rollback in case I fuck up then Ill try and troubleshoot this thing cause I havent installed so many mods I cant understand why the game worked once with the trainer then crashed and then started working again after removing the trainer only EVEN THOUGH we know by now that it still works.

Stock display is the one people dont like but the IPS upgrade is new. Use coupon code EXCLUSIVEOFF to make it  again.
