30656,0,t1_cehmeh3,gt Lost so much respect for a rival after they kept booing injuries.Eagles fan here the booing of injuries last night and throughout this season is because of the perception that the injuries are being faked in order to slow down the flow of our offense.

I said that theyre a poor gauge of a players true skillstatusranketc.gt ...Haleys impact on three Super Bowls was without a doubt worthy of the HOF.I never said it wasnt in fact I said he should be in the HoF but that he shouldnt be selected ahead of more deserving players. Do you disagree with this statement? Do you think Strahan who was unquestionably a better player than Haley should not be selected before Haley just because Haley has more rings? Reggie White only has one Super Bowl ring but was most likely the best DEDT to ever play the game. Please try and tell me that Haley was a better player than White because he has  rings.gt Are you saying the best of the best Cowboys who played multiple seasons with the man dont know what theyre talking about?!?!Another strawman argument. Seriously where did I say that? Please point me to the sentence where I said that or quit trying to misrepresent my position. gt BTW...all of those players are hall of famers and know what it takes to get in.Are you implying that the only people who have a say in the selection process are hall of famers? Or that their opinions are more valid than those of the official selection committee?Again let me restate my position. Haley was a great player and deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. He does not however deserve to be selected over clearly better players. Either you disagree with this statement or you dont. Which is it?,cowboys,cepdy22,2,t5_2re7g

140011,0,t1_ceucizo,Dallas absolutely has not had Super Bowl talent across the entirety of the roster the past three years. Last year it was the abysmal offensive line which was the bane of Tony Romos existence and all three years a lack of depth beyond the starting  has been obvious particularly on defense.Playcalling and consistent coaching is part of the issue sure but talent from Roster Spot  to Roster Spot  is quite fair to question IMO.,cowboys,ceudl5x,3,t5_2re7g
143070,0,t1_ceuq293,The DLine played great considering it was basically a revolving door of guys off the street. Marinelli is the DLine Coach. He brings out the best in his guys,cowboys,ceuq5f0,5,t5_2re7g
155093,0,t3_1vv5i8,For me personally its the defensive line. Lets take a look at the players we have Im just gonna include the main guys who will have the biggest roles on the team. Defensive EndWares play has began to decline injuries are taking a toll on him and I think we have to accept that he might not be as good as he was in  etc. If he doesnt take a paycut and restructures then Ill be disappointed were restructuring so many contracts already that it is absolutely killing us. Were not going to pick up a big name in free agency so well have to pick up maybe a supersub in the draft early that we can throw in on passing downs to give guys like Ware and Selvie a rest.Speaking of Selvie lets not think that weve found the next Deacon Jones here his play began to tail off after a hot start to the year so I think this justifies my point in picking up another rotational guy who can give us a boost and some pressure at times when players like DeMarcus and Selvie get banged up late in the seasonin games. Tyrone Crawford I have a lot of hope for Crawford. Hes my pet cat for this year by slimming down to  pounds he can play the Tech in an explosive Hatcher type of role on the line or he can play the Strongside DE on running downs in a Red Bryant type of role up in Seattle Tyrone was a  DE so I think run stuffing is his main asset he can be key to us in that Bryant type of role. I have a lot of hope with him next year he doesnt stop talking about working out on Twitter so thats a good sign and Rod moulding him into a starting defensive lineman. People forget that the reason we passed on D Line in the draft is largely because of Tyrone his Achilles injury will be difficult to come back from however. Ben Bass Ive heard tweets of him having some explosion from Cowboys beat writer Bryan Broaddus. Maybe Rod can get something from him to become a rotational guy. He could be good for depth which we desperately need. Anthony Spencer Hm. I dont think we keep him if Im honest that surgery he had was a high risk procedure and unless he comes back on a prove it low balling deal for  year then I think Jerry steers away from him. Itd be nice to see him come back and play well though I doubt it. Everette Brown showed some flashes against the Vikings with a sackfumble. Maybe stays for another year. Edgar Jones Special teamer occasional pass rusher. Defensive TacklesJason Hatcher What do we do with Big Daddy? Well we cant do anything. We dont have the money to pay what he wants so we probably let him walk. We could tag him but it would kill us. We desperately need someone to replace his presence in the middle Aaron Donald anyone? I love him. Nick Hayden Graded out as PFFs nd worst defensive tackle in the league. He was mediocre in the running game but when it came to pass rush he was just awful Id rather not he be starting the DT position next year. TLDR We need over  pounds of raw beef on the defensive line from the draft. I suggest we double down on defensive tackles in the draft grabbing either Donald Hageman or Louis Nix III in the first round then going for a pass rushing DE maybe someone like William Sutton in the nd as a situational speed rusher like Seattle has with Irvin when he goes on the D Line. Then in the third we go DT again. Defensive line is our biggest need this offseason and I want the team to go grab a fuck ton of them.  ,cowboys,cew3hnq,14,t5_2re7g

381737,0,t3_1yfz9m,I honestly think this cap increase hurts us significantly in the long term.Miles is probably still a June st cut excepting ridiculous circumstances cap increasing m etc.. Restructuring the various contracts meant to be restructured Lee Scandrick Witten Romo etc. and some minor cuts Costa Durant etc would give us plenty of room under this years cap to handle things. However with the limited cap we could definitely have made the argument that Ware needs to take a significant pay cut closer to T Suggs contract and Ware wouldnt really have any leverage since no one would give him the type of money he wants. The inflation of the cap will inflate FA prices this offseason and removes a lot of the leverage we had with his contract negotation. ,cowboys,cfkbz00,1,t5_2re7g

1567331,0,t1_cjcq0j6,Ok we were talking about different lists.First I think youre really overestimating how many free agents were going to bring back for the  season. Most of the guys who will be free agents after this season the list you linked to are going to be replaced by draft picksUDFAleague minimum free agents. Thats just the way NFL rosters work. Theres always a big roster churn. I was referring to this list of  players who are under contract for . This is where the . million number comes from. Even if we bring back some guys from your  free agent list then they will displace the guys on the list of top  players under contract for  so the net increase on the . number wont be that great. E.g. if we give Selvi  million a year then Copeland is no longer in the top  and the net cap increase is only k. The rest will be replaced by draft picksUDFAsleague minimum guys who will make the same or less than the guys on the top  in  list. Either way there arent many outstanding major expenditures other than Dez and maybe Murray.Edit Just to clarify in case there is confusion. The list of  under contract in  does not include UFA. I know people have been saying Free is a free agent after this year but Ive been seeing conflicting reports about that point. Overthecap.com has him listed as under contract for  with a cap number of just over  million. If hes not under contract then our team cap number for  is considerably lower.,cowboys,cjcqle2,0,t5_2re7g

1619702,0,t1_cjj2t7a,Thank you for saying Ratliff and not Hatcher. Ratliff was a good player who just could not get his motivations right and the Cowboys were hurt not to have him. Hatcher was a sub par player who had a career year. All of the media as well as many people act like the Cowboys were losing a perennial pro bowler on par with Demarcus.  We didnt.  Also to your point I expect our defense to be better this year. Last years defense was more talented by far but it doesnt matter how talented a defense is if a third of the players are out with injury and the other third are playing at  due to nagging injuries like hamstrings. When things like this happen decent back ups need to step up. We did not have that last year but I feel that we do this year. At least our backups will be drafted or decent undrafted rookies or people with some sort of NFL experience,cowboys,cjjbv7u,3,t5_2re7g

Its not that interaction in forbidden but rather the idea that one could assume that because this guy is out partying with the Jones family and not other teams that he might be inclined to give them preferential treatment.I managed a team at my past employer. My team and I would go out socially as a group for team events and that was fine. But lets say for a second that I hung out frequently with one particular member of my team and then that particular employee was given a promotion over other people that reported to me. Even if the promotion was based solely on merit I have opened the door for people to speculate that he was hired based on his friendship with me.

He wouldve been in the same injury limbo wasting a precious roster spot. As far as a WR goes...definitely not worth a roster spot and thats all he wouldve been doing for us as it became obvious he wasnt a sustainable KRPR. Danny Amendola at the time was unfortunately probably not worth a roster spot. He needed time to develop. He looks good in the slot playing that Wes Welker type role but the guy simply doesnt have the production that Wes has. Thats what its all about for me  production. In hindsight  sure  hes worth the roster spot over Isaiah Stanback Mike Jefferson and Sam Hurd but cmon...to act like Danny Amendola is some gem that the Cowboys threw away is kidding yourself.  ,cowboys,ck1c55c,4,t5_2re7g

I cant tell you how many games Ive seen him blow because he tries to force a pass thats not there we saw three today. Hes  not the QB of the future for us anymore. And especially in a game where our defense did pretty decent but nothing too special. So I agree with you and I know a lot of people will sayOh its the first game so we cant base that decision just because of one lousy game. People weve seen him do this over and over again. Ok maybe some of the Interceptions hes thrown has been miscommunications between him and his receivers but today was all him all forced ridiculous passes. ,cowboys,ckc5h1k,0,t5_2re7g

2146421,0,t3_2jk6dk,Its been hard to be a Cowboys fan openly for almost  years. Almost all of us have been let down so much  in recent years that we are extremely weary of any hint of success. The fans that are most outspoken about the Cowboys mediocrity in your day to day life are probably the fans that either realized this a long time ago and maybe some are the fans that gave the rest of us a bad name by not settling for anything but Superbowls and jumping ship early.Look at  we all should be pretty damn happy about the teams accomplishments. But even around here where I see nothing but alot of true Cowboys fans I still get the sense that we are all waiting on the other shoe to drop for the bottom to fall out and for the team to self destruct which we all are accustomed to.It seems most of the people in my office are this way too. Alot of them who I know are closet Cowboy fans were ready for another season of . Here is the mindset and the rationale from a long time Cowboys fan perspective. Game  ers  Typical cowboys completely beat themselves   Game  Titans  Yeah but the Titans suck doesnt mean anything now were  just average.  Game  St Louis  Yeah we won but they almost blew it again and the Rams aernt as good as we thought the Sints will be a real test.  Game  Saints  I cant believe we beat the Saints that bad they must really be bad this year. JJ Watt is going to destroy us next week  Game  Texans  We barely got out of that one alive guess the Texans wernt as good as we thought. Seattle is unstoppable that one is definitely going in the L column  Game  Seattle  OK that was crazy Seattle played a horrible game we got lucky and caught them on a bad week and also maybe they arent as good as everyone thought. Now personally I felt something was different after the Saints game though I wouldnt admit it fully. I didnt want to get my hopes up. Then they beat the Texans when all I had been hearing about all week was how good the Texans were this year. At this point I was getting a little more optimistic and thinking hey this team is gonna be better than . I still thought Seattle was going to beat us. Then they dominated Seattle. If not for a few key plays it would have been a blowout. At work on Monday I declared to everyone that has also been timidly been watching the Cowboys that I was ALL IN. That this team is the real deal. As a fan I am excited again and I dont actually remember the last time I felt this way.Dont blame them for being slow to accept this success as genuine. Weve just been burned alot and some are going to take longer than others to come around. Look at the highest TV rating football games of the last  years its overwhelmingly Cowboys games. Youre going to start seeing alot of fans come out of the woodwork in the next few weeks.,cowboys,clcnqlb,7,t5_2re7g

They forced  interception. The final one came when the  Bears were at the Packers  with seconds left trying to tie the game. Rodgers day was  for td and int.    Brady had a cake schedule at the end of .     Its a team game. Why did the Patriots and Colts make it to the Super Bowl when their QBs werent playing well?

2582896,0,t3_2pct3r,That would go against the other rule from this season  score  points and win otherwise lose.Luck will definitely get his standard  yards against us.  But I dont see them containing Dez DeMarco and Tony.  Itll be a shootout.  It might slightly take an edge off the Colts motivation in that theyve won their division already and its unlikely that they can pass either the Pats or Broncos for the bye.  They lost to both teams already and so would lose almost all tiebreakers.,cowboys,cmvpzwu,3,t5_2re7g
2585440,0,t3_2pdztg,Well Im shocked he went this far in the season without some type of injury. Now I think we should let Randle play and Dunbar and have Murray sit out at least this game.

2587114,0,t3_2pe7rp,Generally agree  except Free is out too and weve seen already this year that as quality as Parnell is backing up the run game is not as good without Free meaning if Randle cant get the job done one could point to Frees absence as the reason.From Murrays point of view  hell do anything he can to play in this game. If Randle goes in and puts up  Murrays bargaining position just dropped significantly. Not only with the Boys but across the league  a good chunk of his accomplishment will be attributed to the line.,cowboys,cmw9uvm,2,t5_2re7g

2590156,0,t1_cmwmqhj,I remember coming into this season highlighting that we had obviously gotten better on offense and literally couldnt get worse on defense which if you look at is very true. Ware was hurt most of last year and Melton was basically a plug and play for Hatcher. I knew our defense would be bad but historically bad like everyone predicted was a ridiculous stretch. I went into more detail when this was discussed before the season but even then I only saw  at best and that was because of our schedule.  Happy to say my predictions have come true except the record we did a lot better than I thought.,cowboys,cmwo51a,3,t5_2re7g

I say sign Dez  and let Murray walk  and pick up another RB in the rdth round after we get a pass rusher and a CB.  I also think Randle would actually do just fine with our Oline  I mean he averaged almost  YPC when we did use him.

You just have to keep at it and succeed with the ground game.It should just be a great game.And the cold makes the passing game tougher and makes the running game better as far as Ive ever seen. It also makes fumbles more likely in my opinion good for us against a team not prone to takeaways while our defense thrives and focuses on it.

I understand when everyone says that the RB position is devalued because of the availability of serviceable backs BUT there is a big difference between those backs and the top tier talent backs and DeMarco is a top caliber back.If you watch a lot of football you can start to tell the difference between the playmaker backs and the ones that are just a product of a good system.  Since Ive been watch the boys late s Ive seen a bunch of RBs come in here and some of them have received a lot of hype after initially good starts julius jones marion barber felix jones but I was never that big on any of them because that just didnt look that special  even when they were doing great.When I watched DeMarco run in his rookie season.... I though wow this could be the best running back Ive ever seen on a Cowboys team.  And my opinion of him has only grown the more I watch him.  He always seems to get more yards then it appears a sign of a great back he always seems to make the right decision on his cuts hes a good blocker underrated and he a strong desire to win remember his reaction when getting that TD in the Detroit game?.Its really unfortunate that were in cap trouble because its tough enough to draft good players but its really crappy when we cant afford to resign the good ones we get.I think Randle will do fine as a starter but I do see a significant drop off in running production.

2969605,0,t3_2twmne,With this division? Who fucking knows. I DO expect us to be in the running as always though. The Eagles could be poised to make a good run if they can fix their CB and QB situation. I didnt really think their QB situation was really THAT bad. I thought their secondary was the bigger problem. Either way they have a good chance to rectify both in the Draft and FA. Giants could seriously come out swinging on offense. Teams will have to pick their poison with Cruz and OBJ. They still need some help up front though to protect Manning. This draft class is deep on quality RBs as well so they might get lucky there as well. Their defense was plagued with injuries last year kind of like us in  and I dont follow them close enough so I dont really know if there are any major gaping holes that need to be filled on that side of the ball. Skins.....I dont know what to make of them. They have QB issues receiver issue defense issues...... Just a hot mess from what I can tell. Again I dont follow them TOO close so maybe I am missing something. Cowboys are fine on offense with a big question mark for  RB. But we need DT help DE help CB help and S help. And there are a bunch of question marks surrounding what is going to happen with the LB core. Though with how we have been drafting and the way Marinelli is able to prepare the subtalent we had to get the best out of them.....I am fairly confident that we will make a solid showing next season.,cowboys,co5nq56,1,t5_2re7g

The Back  was fine.

4846379,0,t3_3h84bg,I really dont see the Eagles being that much of a threat to the Cowboys this year.gt  The Eagles front  looked very dominant early. The Colts struggled to open holes for their back and didnt have a lot of time to throw.The Colts have great pass protection but are terrible at creating holes for the run game. Top priority is protecting Luck and letting him do work. Also Tipton was the back in the game at that point he is pretty terrible he might not even be on the team this year because of Gore Herron and Robinson. With your guys Oline I think their front  is going to look much different.gt Their secondary was a clear weakness early. The Colts converted a handful of rd and longs and while some of the throws were off the opening were definitely there.Luck had no problems with their secondary when he was in the game. He went  wouldve been perfect if not for Fleener dropping a pass. I can see Dez torching this secondary easily and Witten finding his openings like he always does.,cowboys,cu5f7ma,2,t5_2re7g

I think hed be even better behind our oline.I know there was the whole debate over whether Murrays production was his skill of the oline.

With no income taxes in Texas he probably couldve earned basically the same amount if he hit all the performance objectives in the contract however with the way hes looked so far this year its been a much better decision for him to take the guaranteed cash.

5602568,1,t3_3ruo1k,Ok I really do understand the intense emotions that are being played out here. And maybe as a Cowboys fan this seems biased but I swear this is how I feel as a person in general.I agree that DV is horrible and a despicable act and no matter if he did or did not actually and willfully beat her yes the pictures are awful but if they were as damning as we want them to be the DA could have continued the prosecution without her Hardy should be speaking out against DV and using this as an opportunity to do the right thing.However there are a lot of crimes stupid ones violent ones that happen with NFL players all of the time and yet we dont have graphic evidence of it so we dont seem to have the vitriol as we do in this case.I really do believe that people deserve a second chance whether you think he has been punished enough is your call but he has been punished in some capacity and personally I would rather see people given a chance to reform and put in a position to learn from their past and mistakes then shunned by society.This is sad to me that people can not manage to have empathy for more than one person in a situation. For the girl yes no matter how it went down it was awful for her but also for Hardy and to help him reform rather than spew hatred.So many people hate the justice system because we dont reform or rehabilitate people yet when someone is given the chance to learn we scream for them to be punished until we are satisfied or they are destroyed.I dunno maybe Im just sad by all the hate on both sides.TLDR Incredibly awful situation wish people would show some empathy for both sides and opt for forgiveness and redemption over hate. Might just be sad.,cowboys,cwrjwga,-5,t5_2re7g

It is easy as a fan to say tank  it makes you a shitty fan but that is a different arguement... but as a coach you absolutely cannot make that decision and expect to keep your job. If Garret just came out and said well guys no one wants to win anymore so we are just gonna give up and give Moore some reps even though he most likely wont even be here next year...just becuase...i mean why not right? You would be the first to scream fire him. So how can you so emphatically argue that we should do something that reduces our chance to win and get angry that the coaches arent doing that thing?

Youd think that a team this talented even without Romo could find a way to win even  game during Romos absence. But that didnt happen even against the bucs or saints.

Also with only mil in cap space why invest in benched players instead of filling out our offensive line? Aka the most glaring issue with last season.,cowboys,d0lunmr,0,t5_2re7g
6791006,0,t1_d0lzy71,Yep.  On the plus side there are very few positions that immediately translate to production on the field these days.  Only RBs you can trust to jump right in and get acclimated.  Secondary and DL types usually take a while to really develop.,cowboys,d0m1s2o,1,t5_2re7g
6806075,0,t1_d0nmkkk,If they want a pure corner then VH is their guy he really impressed at the combine. The chances of Spence being the pick are slimmer probably because of the concerns but the talent is there more so than Bosa or Buckner. Bosa is a solid player but Im not looking to draft a simply solid guy in the top  I want an almost immediate game changer. Buckner just doesnt seem like the right fit for our scheme to me. Plus I dont trust Oregon D lineman. ,cowboys,d0nri19,1,t5_2re7g

Everyone will call you a front runner.....even thought you didnt even root for them in the s and theyve not been successful for a long time.  Everyone will blame YOU when the cowboys pick up an unsavory character ala Greg Hardy.  People will seek you out when Romo gets hurt.But that to me is part of the fun. If you can only root for your team when they are winning you arent a good fan anyway.  So why should you root for them over the Colts?  Honestly I cant think of a reason for a Free Agent Fan to choose one team over another. I will say that they look to be heading in the right direction.  They havent over spent on big name free agents in a long time theyve been disciplined about not handing out huge contracts to aging vets and seem to be making good draft picks for the last few years. Theyve been following the New England find some old solid vets for real cheap and get a good couple of years out of them strategy and I like it.

I wasnt there for the picks after but Cravens was not available and they felt like Cash was a viable replacement for Church next year in the way he plays.

Yet Dunbar hasnt established himself as a runner at all zone or otherwise. Period. He has done well as a receiving back but hasnt really outperformed McFadden in that area either.To make matters worse Dunbar is coming off of a patellar injury. Very few people having such an injury return to their former greatness. As much as I like Dunbar he was never as good at receiving as McFadden was at rushing.

7721000,0,t3_4l2qsx,The Patriots gave away Chandler Jones for an above average guard and a nd to the Cardinals. Patriots fans think they gave him up so easily because he was on the last year of his contract and they wouldnt be able to afford him anyways. Muhammad Wilkerson of the Jets is also on his last year of his contract and the Jets have been rumored to look for a trade for him since they have Williams ready to step in.

Most turnovers and sacks occur when teams are winning by four points or more even though that accounts for about  of total plays league wide.I also am not worried at all about Lawrence. Im not even sure he will actually serve his suspension. There is a pretty good track record of people in his specific situation winning their appeal. But I expect absolutely nothing from Gregory. If I expect nothing I cant be disappointed.Plus in our defensive scheme being named starters doesnt mean much. Im just saying the numbers dont support your pessimism.

The big knock on McFadden has always been that he is often injured and here we have a chipped bone in his elbow completely away from the game. If Im a team in the market for a running back that has to scare the hell out of me am I willing to give up a valuable draft pick with the significant possibility this guy is going to be hurt a few games in? Probably not.That leaves him with probably more value as a versatile veteran backup on the Cowboys roster a la Ron Leary than he has on the open market.,cowboys,d4becfx,1,t5_2re7g

If those two guys are ruled out and Goff and Wentz and Bosa are off the board and we dont need OL help who should the Cowboys have drafted at ? Its my opinion that Elliott and Ramsey were the only two real choices for Dallas. Based on Ramseys weaknesses and the Cowboys desire to prolong Romos career by using their All Pro offensive line to dominate on the ground it is not clear and obvious that Elliott was a bad pick. Only time will tell but based on everything we knew about these players picking Elliott was a reasonable decision. We can disagree but the reality is we dont know the future.

8923801,0,t1_d7jtp09,In  Demarco Murrays rushes with  men in the box was lower than the number of rushes he had in short yardage goalline and clock killing situations.  In other words in nonobvious running situations the Cowboys simply did not run into  men boxes even though every team from about Week  on came into the game with the  priority being stop Murray.Romo had everything to do with that.  When he saw  in the box on st and nd down he checked out of runs and was insanely successful passing in those situations.It may be true however that GarrettRomoLinehan had a big chat after the  season about in what situations they shouldnt check out of the call in the huddle to avoid disasters like the Matt Flynn game.

We need all the help we can get especially over the next  games until Lawrence can return. But even after that Gregory is such a wild card itll be nice to have the depth.Edit Just from the looks of the rotoworld reports it looks like the Jaguars tried to convert him to LB and it failed miserably and comments from various FA threads in the Jaguars sub make it seem like a lot of the fans thought he had good potential and was just misused.Some crappy youtube highlights ,cowboys,d7lrrfd,9,t5_2re7g

They should give him option routes where he can do a go route or a curl or a cross or a ghost route depending on how the QB reads the coverage.Of course this works when Tony is there to audible into new routes or plays.  We have seen Tony do this many times.  I remember against the Saints last season he switched Bryant with Beasley at the line and Bryant ran this beautiful post route inside and it was a huge pass.I want to see more motion plays that move Bryant around.You cant just keep him on the outside all game.  ,cowboys,d7olb6t,2,t5_2re7g

9121888,0,t1_d87n79d,I know it easy to say these guys were waste when you are strictly looking at football. Remember though a lot of these guys are still very young and going through a lot of growing up very quickly. Take some time to learn about them where they came from what theyve been through and youll understand a little more why they are where they are today. Dallas knew all of these things before they picked either up so its not a waste its a gamble. Its a gamble on two very good football players who have a trouble past. Were literally giving these guys support to better themselves beyond football and its very respectable decision we dont have to do this. Anyhow McClain has been through more in his life than probably anyone on this subreddit. I noticed that him and Mo Claiborne were  the same way Claiborne came out and said recently he never smiled in  he didnt even want to play football which is exactly what reporters say Rolando McClain did last year. Caliborne says he hit a all time low and from that was able to bounce back into what he is this season. McClain on the other hand is just now hitting his alltime low and unfortunately its a drug addiction. We can call it purple drink all day but its opiates plain and simple. This isnt a one off addict McClain this is a drug epidemic hitting the entire USA and Karlos Williams and likely a great reflection on the state of our mental health system. Which brings me to Gregory. Another guy who is hopefully hitting his all time low and finding a way to come back better and stronger. We could be wrong and he could have smoked immediately out of rehab failing his second test we dont know. In the words of Will Hill III gt I took a long look in the mirror and decided to change a lot of things.At the age of  we cant expect Gregory to be the mature adult we need him to be immediately. At the age of  McClain needs take a huge step back and make some immediately life changes or he could be hitting rock bottom really quick.

Dak just isnt a risk taker like Tony is and honestly hes just not accurate enough to feed Dez in tight coverage yet. Tony and Dalton are both more accurate passers at this stage. The coaching staff has done a better job the last  weeks getting Dez in some different routes and he had a  yard game against Washington and even though he wasnt targeted much against Chicago he still had a big impact and a lot of that game we were just trying to burn clock which means more running and more check down stuff to Beasley.,cowboys,d88stsd,1,t5_2re7g

9177017,0,t3_55yg3m,I was watching The Break on the website earlier and some caller called in saying he had been heartbroken cause he grew up in the s and didnt want Romo back in to just keep Dak.That is just absurd Ive seen Dak these past couple of weeks and I dont think he has been tested just yet not fully. We also dont have that much to go off him sure he shows good signs and is way beyond his years but no way he can go head to head with Romo.    Unless Romo goes out there and drops INT after INT that are on HIM then yes.I know the fans me included want to watch the Boys win...I know that I long for that but Im not going to just ditch the idea of Romo when it comes to playing against the real deal. Dak will be put up to the test when he goes up against the likes of Aaron Rodgers but that will probably be the only glimpse of Elite QBs he will see.I know we saw Eli earlier but Eli is nuts lol...I want to see him go up against Rodgers and honestly I wouldnt mind having him go up against Wentz just to let the fans have that but then resort back to Romo to finish off the season.Just my two cents.

9237514,0,t3_56v32h,One thing Ive havent seen anyone say about the DakTony debate is what happens if Dak remains the starter with a healthy Romo on the bench and Dak has a bad game? And lets be real here Dak is going to have a bad game.Does Garrett immediately sit Dak after a bad game? If so that poor performance may stick in his craw and he could conceivably not play another game for a few years. How will that affect Daks psyche and the teams chemistry and how will that affect the fans thoughts on Dak as the future of the franchise? My opinion is that if Garrett decides to play Dak it needs to be a commitment through the end of the season. We need consistency at QB just as much as we need good play and having the threat of benching hang over Daks head and the scrutiny hell face with Tony behind him can only hurt his performance. Youve gotta believe a lot of fans will be calling for Garretts head if he doesnt start Tony and could really cause problems in the locker room. Because of this reason and the fact that Tony is miles ahead of Dak I  believe Tony will be the starter for the rest of the year. Anything else is foolish. ,cowboys,d8mx8ax,2,t5_2re7g

We have no way of knowing how many games Tony Romo has left to give us but why not take them while we can? Dak has already proven himself capable of stepping in on a moments notice.

9415912,0,t1_d99g17q,I agree the talent was not great but you can go back and name players from the past on plenty of teams that most certainly arent in the league and never amounted to a whole lot and create a narrative that this means they were god awful.  Furthermore you ignore plenty of players from that  era.  Heres a few that were on the team in  when the talent level was supposedly ass  Felix Jones Dez Bryant Miles Austin Laurent Robinson Martellus Bennett Sean Lee Tyron Smith Dwayne Harris Phil Costa Jeremy Parnell Josh Brent Jason Hatcher Jay Ratliff Marcus Spears Anthony Spencer Demarcus Ware Mike Jenkins Terence Newman Orlando Scandrick.  But Ill digress with this argument.  Sure they werent the greatest but heres what I still dont understand  How does Romo get the credit for taking allegedly awful teams on his back to the cusp of making the playoffs yet when all you need is that one game ending drive in Washington in week   but instead you throw a ridiculous interception in the flat hes not to blame.  No the CAPTALENT is to blame!  What about when you play the Giants in  week  and you start the game with  consecutive  amp outs?  THE CAP TALENT!  What about when your body fails you yet again in Week  vs the Eagles in  and were forced to start Kyle Orton and almost win any way?  THE CAP TALENT!  What about the  season where were so awful that we start the season out  with Romo under center before he yet again gets injured for the season and yet we end the season winning  out of  games with JOHN KITNA as the QB?  Its the talent man!The point Im making is that if Romo is so good youd think he would have done something amazing to transcend this at least once in his career.  He never did.  He was never there to lead the team anywhere.  He was jut a pretty good QB.  He played pretty well for us but when you really needed him to just say IM PEYTON MANNING FOLLOW ME it never happened.  He was either mentally not there or physically not there.  Love Romo as a person I just think hes a pretty good QB and a below average leader.,cowboys,d99j6c8,1,t5_2re7g

Would Tom Brady have been Tom Brady had he been in a different system? We will never know. Those early years of success with BB who despite how much I hate him is an extraordinary coach.Weve seen Tony Romo who has exceptional skill but we had bad team dynamics our defense went from ok to bad to worse. Our OLine was poor up until the last few years.My point is this truly is a team game. Timing of when you were drafted I mean the years who drafts you and why opportunity skill workethic and talent that surrounds you. Im sure there is more factors but were lucky to have Dak we were lucky to have Romo. Our team is talented. We have a legit shot at the SB which the only other year in the last  years I felt this was  but even then I had doubts because of our leaky defense....Anyways in the words of Forest Gump Thats all I got to say about that,cowboys,d9lkthe,2,t5_2re7g

While Dak would most likely be the starter what if Defenses had to plan against both QBs or at the worst case Romo had to step in.  Id rather Romo had some ingame time than be thrown in fresh against a playoff team.  At the very least have Romo finish the th quarters in blowouts.  Romo is one of the most prolific and efficient th quarter QBs in history and excellent in regular season.

Im not sure that coordinators are worried about Prescott running for . yards more than theyd be worried about Romo somehow finding  seconds and a smoke break to stand in the pocket. I digress.  The point that he is making is that stats are pretty but are buoyed one way or the other by the team around you.

He did show some tendencies on tape as an edge rusher which made him intriguing. He also posted a .  time at the combine.The reason we havent seen him is because in training camp they examined him and found out that he has been playing with a broken back called a Pars Defect.

Other teams have tried to do this but couldnt contain Zeke enough or pressure Dak enough to force him to throw errant passes. The Giants can do both.

He didnt have a very manageable last chance with the ball either.

10111004,0,t1_dbp73aw,Definitely a testament to Marinelli and the production he gets across the board from the line. The pass rush has really turned on as of late. I loved a lot of the disguises that we did in the second half on Monday with  down lineman. Its nice when you can psyche a QB out by putting LBs on the line and he doesnt know how many or who exactly is coming. Also a testament to the coverage our secondary has had all season. Carr has been shutdown most games. Heath and Wilcox have contributed with turnovers. Gives Church the ability to play closer to the LOS. Scandrick and Brown both have the flexibility to play nickel CB or outside. Once we get Claiborne back our secondary will be very good. A lot of these sacks have to be attributed to them.

10119213,0,t3_5ks5po,I want to toss a thought out there. Maybe Im crazy.Its happened before. Say that sitting towards the bottom of the first and theres a gap in the draft board where the staff doesnt particularly love anyone but they happen to have a really high grade on someone they think can be a blue chip offensive linemana la Travis Frederick or is a clear BPA on their boarda la Zeke reportedly. Do you think theyd draft them? With the impending loss of Ronald Leary and the possibility to move Lael to the RT spot could they maybe take the guy who they think is the top LG in the draft to fill that spot? Specifically I think Quenton Nelson looks like the real deal and could be available right in the Cowboys range. Keep Dak safe bolster the running game. On defense you hope to continue relative overperformance and for Jaylon Smiths return.,cowboys,dbqjhgh,1,t5_2re7g

10260878,0,t1_dc742fb,Dak wont get this team out of a  point hole especially not in the second half.  If the defense can deliver a few three and outs and we can run the ball well weve got got a good chance.  The fact is Romo is the better QB...thats not even debatable at this point.  However the OC is calling it pretty well to keep Daks inability to throw deep from affecting us.  However teams that can hold the run game in check do well against us Giants Vikes Eagles because when forced to throw Dak is pretty average at best.  If its a  TD lead or more in the second half Romo is the answer.

We didnt lose the game for any reason other than our D and our mistakes. The only thing I would question was our FG tying drive. Why spike it on st down like that and slow down the momentum? And then why throw it on rd and  when we have Zeke whos been hot all day? I cant believe we would just go for the tie when it looked like we were going for a win. We left Rodgers with way too much time after that and one play was our downfall. ONE play with that Cook catch.

Dont get me wrong Dak is great and hes our future but I find it insane to try to say hes already a better QB than Romo. The best season to compare the two is with . Romo had a higher completion   more yards not that big of a difference to be fair  more TDs. If you add in Daks rushing TDs Romo has him beat by  still. Only thing against Romo was he threw  more INTs which keeping in mind  of those came in week  which was the low point for that season well that and Thanksgiving. But still  TDs to  INTs is still a good stat. Im not in anyway trying to downplay Dak or say he isnt great. But Im not ready to anoint him as a better QB than Romo based off of one season. If Dak plays all of  lights out like he did this year then yeah I think its definitely worth considering. But I think its too early to say hes a better QB than Romo.

Even if he comes back at  of his old self he would be one of the most dominant pass rushers in the league. His stats were just stupid good when he was healthy.Honestly I dont think the Texans would move him for anything less than a kings ransom.

If Dak can get better  sniffing out when to run on rd amp when to pass amp what runs to call before the snap well be in great shape.

10690974,0,t1_ddioa5n,Thanks for the kind words. I agree with you totally. I just for some reason cant see TWill leaving Dallas I could even see him taking a hometown discount since hes been in the Dallas area pretty much his whole life. I would not be opposed at all to letting him walk and trying to get a speed guy in the draft and even then hes going to be the rd or th option on most plays. I just worry about depth if Dez misses again cuz Bease cant sustain being the number one option for any period of time. Then again Tdub didnt exactly wow anybody when he had to be WR. I love the approach of addressing depth and holes at weak spots. It opens up so much wiggle room in the draft. When its all said and done I support any decisions that McClayStephenJerrythe coaches make. Its a proven formula and they havent messed it up yet. And Im freaking pumped about getting to see Jaylon and Tapper play,cowboys,ddip17y,2,t5_2re7g

At the high school in Iowa that I attended they no longer allow the wrestling coaches to control the temperature in the wrestling room and have instituted a bodyfat test. Also no more rubber suits.They start the season with the hydration and bodyfat test to set a baseline. This determines your lowest allowable weight over the course of the season. Essentially they make sure youre sufficiently hydrated so that your weight isnt artificially low then they weigh you and do a caliper test. From those numbers they determine how much youd weigh if you were at the minimum bodyfat I think ..For example as a freshman I was  and  lbs with  bodyfat. From that they determined that if I only had . bodyfat Id weigh  lbs. The weight classes I was in the neighborhood of were  lbs and  lbs but because my minimum bf weight didnt get me below  I was not allowed to wrestle there. Essentially I came in at  and had to lose a fraction of a pound to get below that and losing any additional weight would have been worthless you want to weigh as much as you can while staying inclass.,cowboys,dee33ue,3,t5_2re7g

11206324,0,t1_df24ad1,Well then maybe Im more aggressive with my love for Romo.  Not only am I emotionally attached but like you I know hes the better player.  I know hes not Tom Brady but hes part of that group of top  QBs in this league.  You wouldnt cut any one of those guys just because a rookie played well.  I just dont get it.  The only thing I can think of is if they think hes really done as a player due to this last injury.  And I see people say that as an argument.   And it makes sense until you realize he was officially the back up for the last part of the season.  As a team that was winning a lot of games you dont make a guy you dont think is capable of playing the backup QB and have no other active QBs on game day.  So that throws the idea of them thinking hes done out the window.I have a unique perspective having worked in a front office for an NFL team.   of the time I tell people to shut up and trust the front office.  I started my career working for a D school.  I know how hard it is for the guys that are in charge to get where they are at.  I will defend coaches and front office guys to the end.  That being said this move I just dont get.  Ive tried to think of all the different scenarios that led us to where we are right now and I just dont have an answer.  Its happening Im on board with Dak because I love the Cowboys.  Ive been a fan for over  years.  The situation is what it is so I accept that.  But its scary to me that weve put all our eggs in one basket.  It scares me that we took a  game sample size and mortgaged the future on it.  You cannot convince me theyve had enough time with Dak to believe he can carry this team further than Romo while Romo is still an active NFL player,cowboys,df281jz,1,t5_2re7g

EDIT as an example of this all an agent has to do is call Kiper and say can you talk about my guy a bit more?  Maybe tweet out that hes projecting higher?  All Kiper has to do is send a tweet that an early  is generating buzz around the league and that could be enough to get that guy drafted mid  getting the agent more money.

Dak played a great game against GB but if they drew a team that was better at stopping the run NYG MIN then putting up  and  points isnt going to get the job done. Im not saying Dak cant win against a team that takes away the run game or that Tony definitely will but Im saying Tony is more likely to win in that situation. Basically with a run game you get elite play out of both of them. Without a run game Tony will win you more games than Dak. Because hes a better passer.,cowboys,dfkejrh,2,t5_2re7g

11696813,0,t3_66uexe,One thing that Ive always felt was a good indicator of a players performance is the quality of the talent around him. A great QB can make an average WR look great a great WR can make an average QB look good and a great DL can make corners look better. For edge rushers the guy on the opposite end determines whether he faces the best OLinemen or the weakest and the DT next to him often determines how well he can peel off on the edge.So for McDowell what is the quality of the DLinemen around him and how did he perform in relation to that? Well from the video that was posted in this thread it seems that the talent around him was so bad that it was basically him versus the entire OLine. Despite that he was still generating pressure through double and tripleteams.Im not worried about the reports of him having a low motor as it is impossible to have a low motor with a Rod up your ass. What concerns me is his repertoire of techniques is so lacking that I think its going to take him at least a year to become a pass rusher in the NFL. Having only  pass rushing technique would make him virtually useless against the opposition in the NFL. The raw talent and physical ability is definitely there however so Im sure Marinelli will find good uses for him in the rotation. But I think its possible that we may not see our pass rush improve in  if we take McDowell. In  the NFL better look out though!,cowboys,dgluot5,3,t5_2re7g
