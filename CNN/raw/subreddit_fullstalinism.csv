4680001,0,t1_ctjitdk,Analysis  Commentary on section II of The DraftPart I Stalin moves away from the subject of the constitution to make a summary of the changes in the USSR in the last  years. Here Stalin briefly outlines the progress made through the abandonment of the NEP and the introduction of five year plans in industry trade and agriculture. The text is selfexplanatory I just made some highlights and edited out some text to fit the  character limit. gtII.   Changes in the life of the U.S.S.R. in the period from  to  ...gtWhat was the situation in ?gtThat was the first period of the New Economic Policy when the Soviet government permitted a certain revival of capitalism while taking all measures to develop Socialism ... The task was to consolidate the position of Socialism in the course of this competition to achieve the elimination of the capitalist elements and to consummate the victory of the Socialist system as the fundamental system of the national economy.A balanced criticism of NEP. gtOur industry particularly heavy industry presented an unenviable picture at that time. ...Stalins emphasis on heavy industry is well known. What is less known is that Stalin wanted to reduce the control of the Party over the industry See Furr  paragraph . gtOur agriculture presented a still more unsightly picture. True the landlord class had already been eliminated but on the other hand the agricultural capitalist class the kulak class still represented a fairly considerable force. ... On the whole agriculture at that time resembled a boundless ocean of small individual peasant farms with backward mediaeval technical equipment. Small individual peasant farms can be very problematic  look at Greek history the currant crisis in the late th cent. and the tobacco crisis in the interwar. gtThe same must be said about our countrys trade.gtThe Socialist sector in trade represented some  or  per cent not more while all the rest of the field was occupied by merchants profiteers and other private traders. Such was the picture of economic life in our country in .gtWhat is the situation now in ?gtAt that time we were in the first period of the New Economic Policy the beginning of NEP the period of a certain revival of capitalism now however we are in the last period of NEP the end of NEP the period of the complete liquidation of capitalism in all spheres of the national economy.gtTake the fact to begin with that during this period our industry has grown into a gigantic force.gt...On the contrary it is now based on new rich modern technical equipment with a powerfully developed heavy industry and an even more developed machinebuilding industry. But the most important thing is that capitalism has been banished entirely from the sphere of our industry while the Socialist form of production now holds undivided sway in the sphere of our industry. The fact that in volume of output our present Socialist industry exceeds prewar industry more than sevenfold cannot be regarded as a minor detail.gtIn the sphere of agriculture instead of the ocean of small individual peasant farms with their poor technical equipment and a strong kulak influence we now have mechanized production ... We must not overlook the fact that the collective farms now have at their disposal  tractors with a total of  horse power and together with the state farms over  tractors with a total of  horse power.gtAs for the countrys trade the merchants and profiteers have been banished entirely from this sphere. All trade is now in the hands of the state the cooperative societies and the collective farms.gtA new Soviet trade  trade without profiteers trade without capitalists  has arisen and developed.gtThus the complete victory of the Socialist system in all spheres of the national economy is now a fact.gtAnd what does this mean?gtIt means that the exploitation of man by man has been abolished eliminated while the Socialist ownership of the implements and means of production has been established as the unshakable foundation of our Soviet society. Prolonged applause.gtAs a result of all these changes in the sphere of the national economy of the U.S.S.R. we now have a new Socialist economy which knows neither crises nor unemployment which knows neither poverty nor ruin and which provides our citizens with every opportunity to lead a prosperous and cultured life.gtSuch in the main are the changes which have taken place in the sphere of our economy during the period from  to .,fullstalinism,ctkgmge,4,t5_399v5

The style in which they record honestly has kind of kept me from watching much.  Ive pretty much stuck to Proletarian TV and The Finnish Bolshevik.  I cant find a lot and I think thats because ML isnt so big in the west compared to Trotskyism and leftcomanarchist tendencies.,fullstalinism,d6x7geb,4,t5_399v5

8847014,0,t3_51e65u,Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read along with this book and to debate and comment on it. The addendum to the book in the form of Stalins replies to various authors is linked in order to make it easier to keep trackPart   Part   Part   and Part  If any confusion remains regarding which part comes first consult the order in the book  but with exception of the section that had to be split in two which is denominated by parts A and B  each part can really be read as standalone. ,fullstalinism,d7baaem,1,t5_399v5
8864479,0,t1_d7da6pq,What was the role of white South African communists under apartheid? What was the role of American communists during the Vietnam war? What is the role of communists today in Israel? Opposing the narrow class interests of the labor aristocracy solidarity with the most oppressed proletariat and opposition to its own national imperialism. Few communists would disagree with these and even are aware that the slogans workers of the world unite for a white South Africa or neither Israel nor Palestine but global revolution are in reality horribly anticommunist. But we have trouble applying these concepts to ourselves I guess IsraePalestine is much closer than AmericaNigeria.,fullstalinism,d7ddwfs,2,t5_399v5

9273075,0,t3_57d3as,Ive been watching this series and I like it...but he refers to socialist Albania as a socialist superpower several times. I cant help but think well maybe hes talking metaphorically or spiritually but that seems to be an exaggerated claim given that it only had  million people. Hopefully he will do a video on the Albanian economy that will give some credence to that claim.,fullstalinism,d8rfg5k,3,t5_399v5
9283535,0,t1_d8so7k9,Yeah I thought so too. I heard one Trotskyist Chris Harman argue that if Kerensky or Kornilov had triumphed then fascism wouldnt have been an Italian word. I couldnt not compare Kerensky to Mussolini the way that this film was shot and I think thats intentional I think the Soviets wanted to draw out the commonalities between their experiences and those of the people suffering under fascism in order to give them a road map if you will to assist them. Its often said the Soviets gave up their internationalism in relation to the revolutionary people of Europe but I dont see it in this film even though it focuses on the Soviet experience mainly.And btw speaking of Trotsky he is depicted in the film asuSocialistKerbal notes as wanting to put off the seizure of power during the desperate impending attack by the Kerensky government. If Kerensky was portrayed as a Napoleon in the pay of the Allies I am not surprised that Trotsky was portrayed the same way at the Moscow Trials. But hell Trotsky couldve been doing his wrecking work way back then when Kerensky was still in power.I dont think Trotsky was exiled from the USSR when this film was made but its interesting to see that the popular and official outlook on Trotskys activity and legacy was souring already.,fullstalinism,d8sr7hr,2,t5_399v5
9444191,0,t1_d9d0i3b,Its not clear to me North Korea is all that neoconfucian. You could argue it was influenced by silhak but thats hardly continuous with the confucianism of Yi Seonggye. I would imagine shamanism cheongdoism and proletarian strands of Buddhism probably play a much more important role in North Korean culture. North Korea considers these proletarian ideology within limits whether thats the case or not would require much deeper study than Im willing to do. In general I would avoid falling into orientalism even if you mean well and not concerning yourself with how North Korea looks to the white supremacist West that is interested in wiping it off the map. ,fullstalinism,d9d49qc,3,t5_399v5
9449713,0,t3_59ys1k,Kim Jong Il led the country through its most challenging period the Arduous March now and saw the country recover from famine and get back on the path of technological cultural and ideological revolution.He also helped form new diplomatic ties primarily with China and Russia after the collapse of the USSR who used to be their closest ally which were crucial for the survival of the state.He oversaw the beginning of the unfortunately necessary nuclear program Kim il Sung was opposed to nuclear weaponry until absolutely necessary which is what allows the state to remain strong in the face of imperialism.The WPK dont give a flying fuck what they look like the rest of the world is going to demonise them no matter what and so they dont need to bother about looking good for the imperialists. They and I believe Kim Jong Il was right for the job and good luck to them for it.He also helped expand the Juche ideology which has been crucial to the DPRKs survival.,fullstalinism,d9dtfvx,6,t5_399v5

9686434,0,t1_da6vpl2,No idea. I was talking more about how the protest was handled well by citizens the police and the media. I did notice the Shanghaiist only reports the first half of the story and not the second half which talks about his medical treatment and family history something already suspicious. But the fact that not everyone gets the medical treatment they need in China is already known. Heres a decent article covering the basicsWhat you think about that is up to you providing modern Healthcare for . billion people is surely no easy task though clearly efforts at privatization in the early s were a giant mistake which are now being corrected. This ladys story is just one of many its only remarkable because of the white male obsession with Asian womens virginity. ,fullstalinism,da723wu,2,t5_399v5
