3246727,0,t3_2x9sma,My car insurance pays to have chips fixed at no extra cost to me. I guess because chip repairs are cheaper than replacing whole windshields. Call your insurance rep first to see if its covered. Covered or not they can probably give you the name of a company who will fix it. Or google windshield chip repair. It looks like there are do it yourself videos. I dont know if those work well or not.I do recommend repairing rather than just ignoring a chip. If not fixed they tend to grow into bigger cracks that cannot be repaired. ,car,coyj5bf,1,t5_2qjp0
