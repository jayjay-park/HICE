If you make a successful attack and wait to make your second attack only to find us way ahead then I dont have a huge issue with not attacking a second time.  I dont have a solid opinion on how we should handle it.  Ill let other people weigh in.,RedditLurkers,ci11am0,1,t5_31soc
1390253,0,t1_ciqjr39,Actually in all seriousness I have a suggestion. Dont deploy your BK at the start when dragon swarming. Hold the BK back until near the end and if it looks like your dragons are going to be too slow to get to the last buildings then drop the BK there. Check out the replay of my attack on Charlitin for an example. It works well for me as a tactic.,RedditLurkers,ciqjsg5,2,t5_31soc
