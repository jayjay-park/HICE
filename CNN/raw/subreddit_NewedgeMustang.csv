3664626,0,t1_cq9s2sh,Unfortunately not really much done. When i got her she came with a new factory ford crate engine with k on it cause the st owner blew it up. Body has k on it. Clutch needs a new throwout bearing and probably gonna be the first thing i tackle with a stage  and aluminum fly. As it comes it has the Roush CAI LCAs Roush Lowering Springs rims all aroundwhich i need to get the crappy plastidip job the previous guy put on them with s in the front and s in the back. And other than SR performances coil on plugs and NGK sparks for a misfire i fixed everything else is stock.,NewedgeMustang,cq9zq6u,3,t5_2w1pc

4981307,0,t3_3j4qyf,I see someone post about this idle surge almost weekly in this or any Mustang forum.I responded to another person a while back but didnt get much love but here is how I dealt with it on my  GT.Have you tried the modification of altering the gasket for the IAC? I replaced my IAC and installed the factory gasket and had big time idle surgehang. Luckily I kept the old gasket. When I looked the hole was much smaller than the factory one.The previous owner did this mod and it made a world of difference. You can see step by step how to do this hereMy understanding is that it is an emissions thing.Now that being said it could be a number of things vacuum leak but this is what my solution was.,NewedgeMustang,cumfj8h,3,t5_2w1pc

10934988,0,t1_de7u5k5,It came with a SRA and I actually thought about IRS at one point but decided to stay with a SRA setup. I dont really do a lot of aggressive canyon carving and truth is I plan on a lot of torque in the future and was worried about the longevity of the IRS in that context.And I made friends with John Griggs along the way because of the Coyotified aspects of my car.  Hes a great guy.  The mm torque arm setup while decent is not as sturdy IMHO.  ,NewedgeMustang,de7v88d,2,t5_2w1pc
11066070,0,t1_delu06n,What kind of emissions testing do you have? Longtubes will most likely cause an issue but IDK how they react if the system has catalytic converters in place that are as efficient as stock though that defeats the purpose IMO.,NewedgeMustang,dembu6m,1,t5_2w1pc
