5870817,0,t3_3vnarm,I work at The Vapor Emporium in New Market. My honest opinion is that it is the best store in the Frederick area not just because I work there. There is an Avail going down due to bad management SS Vape which everyone hates and Urban Vapes is pretty nice. You all should check out these stores!,Maryland_Vapers,cxp71q2,2,t5_2z4lu
