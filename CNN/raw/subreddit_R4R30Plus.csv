9792860,0,t1_dak5ho1,Im not sure thats easily answered.  Im assuming associations.  Something may feelsound like water without actually being like water.  How can I describe what translates a specific piece in a track to make me feel and see like Im submerged in a dark murky greenish brown pond looking up at sunlight refracting through the water?  Why do I feel that cerulean blue can be wind or innerstrength for example.  My best guess is that is has to do with the way my memory works and the associations Ive formed long ago before I was even conscious of doing so.  I say that because I always work with music.  If I can play something that triggers that specific memory its the visual I had initially and the feelings associated with it.  Its akin to asking someone how they remember where they left their keys.  ,R4R30Plus,dak6kqi,1,t5_2vafg
