When AndrewsSmith had their falling out with Levy the Retro Computers website went with it for a while  Lee had to recover it from archive.org or something similar.For what its worth Andrews has publicly stated that he sent Levy a copy of the website so theres no real way of knowing whos to blame here.,zxspectrum,d4yq76m,2,t5_2ttxf
8784561,0,t1_d7350x2,Yeah  you know what I could have covered that in the video. If a game uses lots of buttons there are various virtual overlays which the user can switch between. For instance overlay  might map A B C and D to the four buttons. Overlay two might map E F End and Home for instance.There is also a virtual keyboard. Well done for calling me out on that. Ill make an updated video soon. The controls are I believe emulating a Kempston interface. I would have really wanted USB keyboardjoystick support. I wish theyd just stuck a Raspberry Pi in there it would have saved so much faff.,zxspectrum,d73qqxv,3,t5_2ttxf
