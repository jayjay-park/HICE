1028115,0,t1_chl544h,I didnt expect it to be from the U.S.  I found this thoughI found a bright purple roly poly in my garden. Why is it that color?There is a type of virus called an iridovirus that attacks terrestrial isopods roly polys or pill bugs and forms crystals beneath their external skeleton shell or cuticle. The accumulation of these crystals causes their appearance to change from the normal gray or brown to a bright blue violet or purple. The virus is not dangerous to humans and cannot be caught from the roly poly.,awwnverts,chl5i1r,6,t5_2vtf7
