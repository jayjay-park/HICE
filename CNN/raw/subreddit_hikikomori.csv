7944688,0,t3_4ldkk3,Im not sure if I enjoy it or not. Sometimes I just think that Im too lazy to do anything else. I might be really depressed cause I used to do stuff and enjoy life. Now I dont find any pleasure in anything so why bother life is meaningless anyway. Maybe Ill find my motivation someday or not. Right now I dont feel guilt or anything about not taking part in the society. If I died tomorrow I wouldnt mind one bit.,hikikomori,d4922ja,1,t5_2r721

8960026,0,t1_d7ot8wk,It was called Maidreamin and it was actually okay. I had this guy next to me who seemed to be a regular but acting like pervert to the maids. The maids seem to keep it professional and theyre nice in a way. The service just sucks tho I didnt feel like I am the master and theyre my maids. You really have to get into the roleplay thing which I did not. I didnt prepare myself since we got dragged in on the spot.Im not fan of those figurines as well. They look really nice though and Ill admit I would own a few but theyre just displays. For me I dont see any other reason for me to even have one besides just displaying them. Would rather have something that can be used daily like a mug or a keychain to say the least.Speaking pachinko parlors theyre actually further down from the streets of Akiba. I mean as far as I can remember when I was there. If you walk away from the electric town youll eventually see a pachinko building for sure. I got some pictures of the street I was in Akiba. I think the street in those pictures I took has the one and only Carls Jr. restaurant. It opened at the beginning of March. Unfortunately I didnt get to try out the place because they always have customers filled up inside and there is a line waiting outside in the cold.Pachinko is kinda like slot machines here in America but with just bunch of balls. With the amount of balls you get you can obtain certain prizes or something. Im not into it so I dont know really much about it but people who go to those things are somehow addicted to them.Yup its a building filled with retro games but its nice to look around the place. The very top floor is filled with classic arcade machines. Me and my cousin did some coop play on Metal Slug. Again there was also heavy cigarette odor. I really wanted to just get lost and explore Tokyo but at the same time dont want to end up in a bad neighborhood. Ill say this it happened to my cousin. He end up getting involved in a special massage while exploring around the Ueno area and lost . I really dont what he was thinking when he explored out every night even without a passport. It was his first actual traveling outside the country but Im an amateur traveler yet I still have to be aware around my surroundings and all. Especially when youre in a place youre not familiar of.Heres the area that he was somewhere in. I could be wrong about the area but somewhere there where he was led for a special massage. If youre asked by a guy for special massage or just trying to lead you into a building you dont know about dont. Do not let this happened to you and just kindly decline while you keep walking. I had to do this when I decided to go to Ueno with my cousin the next day since we wanted to check out the Ueno park. The park itself is fine but I think if you just walk on a more public street with full of people and cars around versus cutting through the alleyways filled with bars and special massage buildings just avoid those and youll be fine.I think that Sento was featured in NHK world news or in that one Youtube channel that features places around Japan forgot which one it was. So its gone now? That sucks.Oh man Eleven in Japan? America got nothing on the convenient stores that Japan has. I frickin love it. For some reason the drinks are cheaper in the  that I went to compared to the vending machines that are literally in every block or two. But when its convenient its convenient so getting drinks out of a vending machine is not big deal for me. I love the spicy curry with rice and I just kept getting the curry bread. I love that stuff that  I miss it so much every time I think about it.Oh the link you gave me is that one actually. I just pointed out that the couple had the video about them trying out food from . Speaking of McDonalds I tried their simple cheese burger. I dont know what they did with the meat but its more soft and chewable. My cousin told me that they used real meat with some soy or whatever he said that I couldnt remember. IMO it was a lot better than the American version. Although would still prefer the food at the convenient store like their  if going on a budget trip. Oh and this was the video I saw from the couple trying out convenient store foods ,hikikomori,d7ouzxs,1,t5_2r721
10077316,0,t3_5j7izk,I dont think there is a way to keep it when youve been disassociated with it for so long. For awhile after I fell into this spiral I kind of kept hold of the distorted reality that I lived in before I was like this now its exponentially worse. I get paranoid over small things and worry and stress about things that most people hardly even consider.,hikikomori,dbl3fyi,3,t5_2r721
10925315,0,t3_5v82gc,There are different reasons for why someone can become a NEET and shutin. Im not sure if this is true for your brother but for me... What I need is to find inspiration to do something. Im extremely unmotivated and dont see the point in doing anything. Sometimes I can get enough motivation to start something one day but I never continue the endeavor henceforth. Finding a dream Id want to strive towards if such a thing exists in this world would be the only thing thatd help me.,hikikomori,de6vbw0,1,t5_2r721
