4524145,0,t3_3d0qof,I guess gnosis is very subjective which explains why different people use different gnostic systems.I really think fullness pleromic also encompasses void because it would not be a fullness if it exluded anything.I am also confused by your use of the terms because I find them too Abrahamic to be of use for gnostic thought... Hopefully someone comes along who knows more.,Gnostic,ct0wop5,2,t5_2r6g8

5857608,0,t1_cxesgls,Your model is interesting in putting the creation of the Demiurge before the creation of the Aeons. That is pretty unique and to be honest makes your view either Christianized or simply dualistic. ,Gnostic,cxnglqu,1,t5_2r6g8

I think being solitary is also reference to being in meditation or that state or being silent to led that lightvoice enter...you might be able to do it to while moving but more difficult with all the input from environment and flesh body,Gnostic,dcaqhil,1,t5_2r6g8
11080833,0,t3_5y40bq,The apostles were blind to the spiritual aspect of man.  They saw Mary as the body not the spirit.  So when Jesus told them dont be female they understood it dont be a woman.  What he really meant was dont be female minded. Sophia was called a whore.  Not because of her premicuity with men but she was a whore of the Spirit.  We are a woman with  boyfriends.  The body and the spirit Sekla and Barbelo. When you understand the nature of adultery and who you are being unfaithful to you will see the folly of the apostles and how they could mislead so many.  ,Gnostic,deo03m5,1,t5_2r6g8
