848693,0,t1_ch0pz27,Thats what Im saying. The NATO alliance essentially makes any world war nigh on impossible because no country would be willing to fight an alliance with American power. The only scenario that could result in a prolonged war would be if Russia and china were in an alliance and china launched an annexation of Taiwan which brings Japan into the war with America aligned against china. Is this likely? No. Global markets would collapse making any war economically unfeasible for the countries involved,interesting,ch0r13e,7,t5_2qib0

1353762,0,t3_29kij4,This is all unsubstantiated and much of it is false. For example. As of  the worlds average lifespan is . The approx. average nights sleep nets  hours of dreaming so long as the person gets a full night every night ... Yeah right. So that comes out to more like . years of dreaming though its likely less considering how few people get enough sleep and considering the increasing commonality of sleep disorders. . What? Where is the source? What are we considering animals? Because there are plenty of creatures with brains or nerve clusters or primitive brainlike structures which we cant track using the same patterns that followsuit in our own. There are plenty of other problems with this factual claim.. I cant tell if lough  laugh or cough. . Babies ARE born with kneecaps they form in fetal development  theyre made of cartilage before the bone material forms.Therere more problems but it feels like a waste of time to go through them all. Just ... Just dont call these things facts please.,interesting,cilzh9q,3,t5_2qib0

Maybe even see all the tangential irritating things about it.But then the minute you lose it you realize how much you really miss it.And if you ever manage to get it back youll start to really appreciate it for what it is.Thats love I think.,interesting,cvxv3nn,4,t5_2qib0
