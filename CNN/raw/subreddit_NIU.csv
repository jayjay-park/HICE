535790,0,t1_cg1413g,Im also in a graduate program...but as a transfer. Seriously its been ridiculous hard to meet people since everyone always leaves on weekends and I stay around on weekends. However I really like the program. Theres not much to do here BUT I think the bar scene is decentish. Theres some good dive bars AnnexStanleys and Twin Tavern some places to shoot darts Hometown Fattys lots of places to play pool and some veryattended karaoke nights again at Hometown. Theres things to do...for me the bigger problem has been finding people to do those things with.    As a law student I cant fathom having a roommate. I study A LOT. I pay  for a spacious two bedroom. I couldve found a cheaper space but I have  cats so that limited me a lot.,NIU,cg16cjr,3,t5_2s77y

809984,0,t3_23e05q,I graduated in  so its been almost  years since I was in the dorms RIP Douglas. However if its still a random selection like it was in my freshman year I would suggest having clear ground rules and communication with your roommatetobe. Even if you guys dont become best friends youll be civil which is all you need from a roommate. I would also suggest getting to know your entire floor thats where I met a lot of my first friends. Additionally get a cheap door stop and keep your door open when you are in your room as it encourages social interaction. Good luck next fall and welcome to NIU!,NIU,cgwclj8,5,t5_2s77y

3756670,0,t3_33aac9,I second working on campus.If youre going to be around during the summer they are more likely to hire you. They like knowing they can have someone year round.As for hours they are great in summer. I get the excess hours permit and end up working around  hours or so. During the school year varies depending on your class schedule. I usually only work about  hours a week which is okay but could be better. Easy work though. Plus there are some perks. I know certain University Employees get  off text books at the Bookstore so theres that at least. ,NIU,cqkhkvm,2,t5_2s77y

9734700,0,t3_5ehc7a,Youre uh conflating different things here. First off section  housing doesnt have anything to do with NIU. There are a combination of federal state and local factors that lead to the presence of section  housing in DeKalb. Local legends blame Eddie Williams for bringing section  housing to DeKalb but who knows what the truth is.Then it looks like youre alluding to the CHANCE program which also has nothing to do with section  and has nothing to do with race. The program reduces admission requirements for folks from target high schools e.g. low income areas orphans veterans poor folks etcpeople who might have struggled academically because they havent had the same opportunities as everyone else. They get extra tutoring but are closely monitored and kicked out of the program if they dont perform.Its not like NIUs admissions criteria are particularly stringent to begin with or that theyre turning people away left and right. Right now they would take just about anybody anyway.Lots of folks blame section  and CHANCE for crime in DeKalb. Most of these people are really just afraid of black people and poor people. Fact is most of the crime comes from the drug trade. You know who is buying those drugs? Its not poor people. Its all the nice yuppy college students that are using mommy and daddys money to get high.,NIU,dad0iib,21,t5_2s77y
9789308,0,t3_5fapsz,Dont do it.Im in a nearby city to you and thought similarly. Just two years is all fine and good until you actually start doing it because two years is a long time when youre doing something you hate. Im going crazy. Halfway through the semester I couldnt handle working weeknights and switched to just weekends but now Im wondering if I should just drop the part time job completely. Theres no alternative for me though since Im married with a house and stuff. I didnt think it would be this bad but it is.Id strongly recommend living near or on campus. Itll be worth those two extra hours every day with a difficult major.  Or at least give commuting a try for a semester and then reevaluate. Sometimes you just need to experience it yourself to know if itll work for you. ,NIU,dajqtvf,3,t5_2s77y
