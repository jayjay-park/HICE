509149,0,t1_cfxtmiu,Im not a fan of rindianahoosiers because the people who get attention are generally extremely negative fans. Its always Creans fault and never to his credit. There are other IU forums with a more mature discussion. But I guess I should help turn it into what I want it to be. ,IndianaHoosiers,cfy55v8,1,t5_2sszf

2376462,0,t1_cm5fnzt,Oh ya for sure.  Not saying they are a great team or that a win tonight means we beat a good team.   Just that Make Davis made the tournament last year and IU didnt. ,IndianaHoosiers,cm5ftuq,2,t5_2sszf
2431363,0,t3_2naszt,What the fuck is wrong with Tom Crean. He is seriously the worst coach. Down by  points with  seconds left  timeouts and the best  point shooting team in years and he has us drive for a layup?? He is a terrible in game coach. ,IndianaHoosiers,cmc81zp,3,t5_2sszf
2585260,0,t1_cmvv45j,I do think you have some argument although I would respond that it is worth the risk to end up with a slightly worse coach for a few years before repeating the cycle if necessary when the reward is a higher ceiling. I dont think CTC is a bad coach but his ceiling is at best very good  call it top   and the risk of it being worse than that is quite present. With that said I really dont think your opinion is anywhere close to a majority of those that are paying attention. ,IndianaHoosiers,cmw14w1,2,t5_2sszf

2982029,0,t1_co72g2h,Fair point. If you look up the dribble drive system its all about multiple options on every play. And yea obviously Creans philosophy is to prioritize offense. The only way I could see it working is if you retain large portions of your lineup year over year so they already know the offense and can focus more on defensive improvement. ,IndianaHoosiers,co72m60,2,t5_2sszf

4684251,0,t1_ctkyda9,As it should be. Pressure is already on Crean this year to make at least a small run in the tournament and contend for the big ten title. Let people be impressed when the Hoosiers actually accomplish something if they do,IndianaHoosiers,ctkzulr,3,t5_2sszf

9826609,0,t1_daoc7mt,And Ill say its an upgrade for IU. I covered his first season as head coach at Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis back in  and he was a great coach then. Hes got the enthusiasm and energy that Hep had and players love playing for him. Hes the kind of coach that you build a program around. ,IndianaHoosiers,daoffhb,5,t5_2sszf

11531410,0,t1_dg2rhyz,True. I just dont think hes a sure fire first rounder like others have been I still hope he does well but I just thought if he stayed another year he could improve on his stock from a late first rounder anywhere to a third or fourth round pick into a for sure top ten. But theres a new coach so new everything along with everybody around him so I cant blame him for leaving. I just wanted him to stay so people could see how good he REEEEALLY is. All to him for going for it though he definitely will find a home in the league weve all seen his potential.,IndianaHoosiers,dg335pr,-2,t5_2sszf
