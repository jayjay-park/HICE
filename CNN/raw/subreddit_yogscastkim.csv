Chimeritethe rainbow looking ore can be made into a block and changes changes colour. There is also aurora blocks that are from the twilight forest that have a different colour depending where you place them youve found them in flux buddies before. Theres also rainbow oak trees that are multicoloured. Thats all off the top of my head that isnt too resource intensive Ill go have a look and see if I can find anything else to add. If you need help with anything I mentioned Ill do my best to help!P.S. Id love to see Hannah on! ,yogscastkim,cnvao38,6,t5_2xd6s

3168886,0,t3_2wfxrl,Hi Kim! Hopefully youll see these answers!ampnbsp I like the idea of daily videos as it means that we can pick and choose what content we watch and still have enough until the next day. Please keep using twitter as I really enjoy reading your tweets about upcoming videos general updates and information on the subreddit I saw this post after reading your tweet about it so keep it up!ampnbsp I like the end slates for the previews of the next episodes but personally I dont use the links that much as I use the subscription dashboard on youtube for what I watch. I am sure other people do use them though?ampnbsp Like I said above I dont really use annotations for next episodes but previous episode links can be super helpful as it saves trawling through subscriptions to find them!ampnbsp I personally like the balance of videos at the moment  there is enough of minecraft to keep me watching the long plays and the other videos give completely different game genres that I can watch. I think I speak for the entire sub when I say that more vlogs would be good purely because we like listening to general updates and information about games and what youre up to but if theyre too much hassle to put together at short notice then were fine with waiting for them ampnbsp I think that the page is a little busy but not too bad at all  The Yogskim specials kimpressions and random videos could probably be condensed into one playlist bigger random playlist of all three as that would save lots of room. Kim and the gang play could probably be got rid of as if I wanted to find those videos which I do! I could find them without the playlist. Overall I like that there are playlists though as they save a lot of time finding certainn videos.ampnbspHopefully I dont sound too negative! I really do like the content that you put on your channel and I genuinely look forward to the content each day but I think that the above suggestions could really help with the overall channel feel  But please keep up the good work and thank you for the excellent community interaction that you have!,yogscastkim,coqgcav,2,t5_2xd6s

3376552,0,t3_2yu96j,Definitely like this idea. Having some sort of shared infrastructure like this would definitely make the server feel more communal when everyone was on the Vanilla world and we actually had to build roads supply depots etc. due to  technology being modded in I felt much more at home if that makes any sense. On modded all we had last time I logged in was a refuelling station an armoury some food supplies and The Zoo. Which is nice when starting for the first time but also has no reason for anyone to return to once their own bases are set up.Thaumic Mail is also far more immersive than constantly using slash commands. A small pet peeve of mine but also the reason I stopped logging into the server once someone gifted me the PC version of Skyrim.,yogscastkim,cpd5hb4,1,t5_2xd6s

4865805,0,t1_cu7sylh,Would he though?If we are going off of the assumption that this Lalnable is in fact the same Lalnable that we see in the Yoglabs episode then that means he was created in a lab and has known nothing else.  All of this life he has been treated as dangerous and therefore has been given no free will of his own.  Heck I bet he didnt even get to choose his own name I bet that was given to him. So when he is tasked with this new clone a clone that he created probably against his will wouldnt he give her as much free will as possible?  Let her have things that he never got to have and really build up her own sense of self as she wants to.  Idk it just doesnt seem likely given his actions in this episode that he just treats her like trash and kicks her around.  Even if its just the fact that he went through so much effort to create a clone he does care about her his reaction shows us that.  So no I dont think he would kick her around like that.  I honestly think he would treat her as more of an equal. ,yogscastkim,cu7velk,5,t5_2xd6s

7808717,0,t1_d3rjqc0,Kim Tinkers is very personal taste based when deciding what is best.That said you can make tools the best possible in three steps.In the very beginning you will find a lot of copper and tin.  copper   tin   bronzeYou can use ingots or ore blocks. It doesnt matter although ore blocks double the amount of ingots you get. Copper has good health and mining speed to get all the basic resources you need.Once you can mine obsidian you can make alumite.  block of obsidian  ingots of iron  ingots of alluminium   alumite ingots.Mind you Im talking ingots here not ore blocks. If you put in ore block you have to put in  blocks of obsidian.You could potentially kill the Ender Dragon without improving this. But if you go to the Nether and are able to survive there you may as well get the following  ardite orange ore   cobalt blue ore   ManyullynWithin your current modpack manyullyn has the highest damage item health and mining level.While it is true that cobalt has a mining speed of  and manyullyn only  cobalt has a base durability of  full item  and manyully  full item . More then TWICE as much when using only manyullyn.Because hammers can be used to mine vast areas of stone you deplete a lot of durability. Either you have to use a lot of moss to passively repair it or you have to spend valuable cobalt ingots on repairing your tool when you go on a mining spree. With manyullyn you make take a bit longer to mine things but the risk of breaking it is far less likely.As for the Tinkers ranged weapons Id follow beryms advice on most of the materials if you can get them but NOT on the modifyers.A breakdown of the materials firstCrossbowA crossbow has a very high potential for damage and range. But the materials decide what happens.  Limb. The limbs most important trait is draw speed. If you make a paper bolt it will be very light and travel very far without the need to look at the speed trait of a material. Choose your material that has the highest draw speed with good durability. Blue slime has a great draw speed and arrow speed combined. String. If you use fiery string in stead of normal string your will have a slower draw speed but higher bolt travel speed. In my opinion if youre going for a light bolt such as paper the travel speed matter too little at this point. You can adjust the angle over greater distances when sniping but wont loose the draw speed you need in closer ranged combat.  Binding. The binding had oddly enough NO effect on the whole thing. So if you can make it out of paper to get an extra modifyer slow. The body. The body can be made of whatever has the highest durability so make it out of manyullyn or the three other available ones as listed above. It has no other effects.Bolts  Bolts have two traits you should look at weight and damage. If you choose a heavy material for the bolt it will drop like a rock a few blocks from you but pierce armour easily thus do more damage. So the damage would be great but the range aweful. If you choose a light one it will have greater range accuracy travel speed but less piercing damage it ignores less armour. The core. You can use a heavy one or a light one. A paper core gets you a good range accuracy and travel speed plus a free modifier slot BUT it has a VERY high break chance. Wood has a much much lower one and more arrows in reserve. The coating. The coating gives it a tip of the metal used. You can use the metals traits ability if you so choose to get special effects. the best damage with any core youll get with manyullyn. But any metal before you use should be heavy and have a high durability. More durability  more bolts. Flech The fletch of an arrow the feathery tail has several effects best read up on in the wiki. Slime leaves however have a very small effect on the weapons use but can almost double the number of arrows compared to slime balls.Now for the modifiers...Youll want at least at most?  moss on your weapons and tools except for your hammer. Either max out on moss because it takes a big hit in durability when you use it or make the head out of a material you can easily repair it with and go nuts on redstone.Your crossbow benifits a lot from redstone. The faster you can draw the more dps you can deal.The bolts are a real balance between moss and quartz. Yes quartz gives it more damage but  moss repairs them very slowly. Especially if you dont have manyullyn yet youll swiftly find yourself without them when you got a crossbow with a good drawspeed. Hence my suggestion for starting with two and eventually maybe even three moss when you got a spare Nether Star lying around. Put the rest of the slots full with quartz though nonmetal bolts need the extra damage boost.Again this is my personal take on the tinkers issue. Dont let other people assume a position of authority on you and decide what you prefer or better yet make a new world in creative and try it all out. This is your game and all we can do is give our personal prefference and advice.With kind regardsMarahutep.s.Redstone redstone can be added in multiples of . If you put a block of redstone in the top slot and  redstone dust in the lower slot youll add  redstone per time.  clicks will use both and fills one slot.,yogscastkim,d3trhhv,2,t5_2xd6s

9920073,0,t1_db0csyd,Oh thanks for educating me! Im not sure why I said Sanskrit maybe because the writing looks similar? Also I think I didnt explain myself correctly in the video what I meant was that when I travel around SE Asia Ive always found the similarities between languages and not just the Chinese dialects. So I can hear crossovers in Korean Japanese Chinese etc...and just having a base knowledge in Chinese has really helped me have a starting point for learning the others. I find the same with European languages too! But with Thai I just couldnt hear any base points like anything Id come across before so I really struggled to build on that. One thing I always pride myself on is going to another country and coming away at least speaking a few phrases or being able to have a basic conversation and I just couldnt do that with Thai  never mind its made me determined to give it a real go and do some extra prep work next time Im in the area! ,yogscastkim,db0lztf,3,t5_2xd6s

11739471,0,t3_67hhdl,Hey Kim its been quiet here on the subreddit so I thought Id stop by to say that I loved this vlog. Its always interesting to see bits of other cultures food and places through your prism. And that fricken Diogo guy is a riot too! The both of you had me in stitches and I couldnt stop smiling the whole time. Anyways Im glad to see you have so much fun there and I cant wait until the Malaysia vlog comes out!P.S. Maybe I havent really noticed it until the sun brought them out but your freckles are just too cute. Sorry if this sounds weird or creepy but I just wanted you to know.,yogscastkim,dgqp69e,10,t5_2xd6s
11754135,0,t1_dgrn7ls,I was more curious about how Diogo was saying how he was surprised that a lot of English slang was genitaliabased implying that theirs isnt so much  so whats Brazilian slang based on if not that? sorry I have a fascination with cuss words and insults in all languages   ,yogscastkim,dgsczun,1,t5_2xd6s
