You would never think of playing a serious game with diablo or ETC.  personally I always liked their cc and disruption potential.

4149566,0,t3_382xru,The  free heroes usually have a good selection of heroes and give you a good idea of who you want to purchase later. Its a good idea to play all the heroes so you know what your allies are capable of. For example tassadar and tyrande are supports but their healing is not as good as rhegar or malfurion. On top of that malfurion is a great sustained healer and rhegar is great for dealing with burst damage.Knowing the enemy team heroes can tell you how much burst damage you are going to take who you need to CCtarget first. Knowing your team tells you who the enemy team is likely to focus fire and how quickly your team can burst down a hero.Also playing a tank with random people is a real crapshoot. Very rarely do I find a group that will follow a tanks initiate well much less support you. I recommend playing a support or assassin at least as often as a tank if you are solo queuing. You are less dependent on random players and your gaps in understanding are going to hurt the team less than if you are the tank.,NexusNewbies,crt9juz,1,t5_37o5u

Stall the game as long as possible and take a good teamfight preferably on your base. Remember a  kill for you is worth more than  kills for them if youre behind because the leaders give more EXP.

I wouldnt recommending going all in on a k hero yet.If you are looking to just get new heroes to experience different playstyles malf and muradin are excellent heroes overall and amazing for their k price tags. Lili is also pretty good and ETC is kinda fun if you like tankier heroes. I like Raynor but his kit is pretty boring and if youre bored with Valla this probably isnt the direction you want to go.Anub at k is another great buy. And all of the other k heroes are pretty solid.Johanna is a brick wall of a tank and great in certain comps but cant really get in and do alot of damage or generally vary playstyle if thats what you want to do any particular game. The Butcher is much stronger with a support watching him and a tank peeling for him and is very dependent on the comp of both teams. Sylvy like all  of the heroes you listed is without a doubt a good hero but basically has one optimal build youre gonna want to take and might not give you the variety of play you want.When your only hero is valla It just seems to me like you get so much more out of  or  of the really good lower cost heroes. Another option is a starter bundle if you can justify spending the money. They are a great value if you dont already have the heroes.,NexusNewbies,cssojzg,6,t5_37o5u
4487473,0,t3_3ck9c3,I think with HL its all about the composition and map. You have to learn who Abathur is great with Ive heard with Butcher he is awesome. Sylvanas may be good to have just in case you get a map like Mines and the enemy dont pick her. Im currently learning Zagara and her vision control is so great on some maps as well as her pushing power. I think each specialist does a different job so you have to find the right moment for them. ,NexusNewbies,cswb4b6,1,t5_37o5u
4487537,0,t3_3ck9c3,Its generally recommended you have at least  heroes of each role for HL. I dont really play hl myself because I think Im not ready but I dont think Abathur alone would be enough most of the time. My favorite specialists are Sylvanas Zagara Azmodan and Nazeebo. The first three along with Abathur are usually what you see going into HL picks a lot though Nazeebos recent buffs could get him seeing more play soon that and I have seen some shockingly good Nazeebo play in HL streamsrecordings even when he wasnt popular to pick.As for overall Specialists are heroes that dont quite fit into the other three categories of heroes. They do give sieging perks but they often bring unique abilites to the table that sway the battlfield itself in their teams favor at times. Usually specialists rely heavily on map awareness and intuition to excel.It may be wise to try out the other specialists to see who suits you most.

4602521,0,t1_ctam5w1,I would take it a step further and say that its often wrong to focus the healer. The reason is that the healer is the one role that can safely do his job while staying out of range of all DPS. Any healer worth his salt will rarely be in a position where the enemy team can more safely target him over the tank or DPS.The highest priority target changes from second to second based on positioning cooldowns used and HP pools. Not only that it also varies from party member to party member. If a Valla steps out of position at the very edge of the fight that doesnt make it safe for your Jaina who happens to be the farthest from her to run through all the chaos just to focus her along with the DPS that are already there. Its possible that only  people can safely attack her.,NexusNewbies,ctaqhcx,1,t5_37o5u

4661327,0,t1_cti2mdk,Ive been noticing this as a lvl  for a couple days now. Lots of games are starting with all  in one lane for the first few minutes with long drawnout fights that are pointless. Not sure theres a way to combat that in QM. You can ping and type all you want but a lot of times no one listens.  ampnbsp  As for people refusing to push or have no damage I havent run into that very often. For pushing try pinging as well as typing. Ping them and the tower you want them to attack. Then type  push this tower or something. Worth a shot.  QM can be really spotty with team players and skill. Sometimes I get in a game that I swear everyone is lvl others I get what seems like a full man premade.  ampnbsp  Hopefully like you said you just got unlucky with teammates. Try pinging a lot like caution who to attack objectives to grab etc. A thread on rnexusnewbies mentioned that this was working for someone. It seemed to have his teams play more like a team.  ampnbsp  If theres someone in particular that you think may just not know what they are doing you could try reaching out to them after the game and see if they are willing to accept advice.

5289988,0,t3_3nga59,Rank  Master league player here. Okay now that silly credentials thing out the way. Basically what everyone else has said.. When against a heavy auto attack composition Check vallas level  talent against multishot it isnt as effective as against rancor  siphoning arrow. If there is no better option so for example Regeneration Master is an amazing talent but what map are you on? Will the game last long enough? Haunted mines is normally quick. This also includes whether or not you KNOW how to fully utilise the other talent options if not then Block being a Passive is just amazing. EDIT Block is better for shorter games as youll get a lot out of it over Regeneration Master or other choices however on heroes like Leoric some level  talent choices are integral to the Hero and so block is not really an option.. Are you comfortable with that Hero? The best example of this I can give is Uther. Now Uther is a hero I VERY often take Block on. Based on enemy hero composition my OWN teams hero composition  ranged assassins   tank  I have to be up front and a couple other reasons. But mostly Block on heroes like Zeratul or Uther makes the hero a lot more forgiving. Youll take less damage over all and so can be forgiven certain positioning errors and the such.Any questions lemme know. I hope I have covered the main points at any cost.,NexusNewbies,cvnuwj2,5,t5_37o5u

5650594,0,t3_3rv1k9,I cant think of any heroes that cant win if played well. Stitches and ETC recently got buffed up from being trash but they generally require a team that will follow up on their engage well. Without it you just run in take a bunch of damage and either die or need to hearth.Other than that I would say play whatever you enjoy unless its hero league and it destroys the comp. If your team needs a support and youre last pick play one etc.A good nova can be pretty terrifying even with a decent team. Once she gets her GP stacks up she can wreck people. Azmo is okay feared late game if he gets his stacks and a strong lane pusher.,NexusNewbies,cwxieos,1,t5_37o5u

6851791,0,t3_49f8en,Some games you cannot win.  If you let a rank  play your account they will probably win  of your games but they will still lose .Since you duo queue your chance of getting that feeder is  while its  for the enemy team.  You just have to win when the other team has the feeder and then half of the remaining games that dont have a feeder.  Then you will have a positive win rate and rank up slowly.You totally do lose games because of teammates but your nonpositive win rate is your own fault.  You should focus on what you can control which is to do everything possible within a game to win.  Artanis is suiciding?  Ask the entire team to follow him.  If you can turn around even  out of  of these seemingly lost games that will boost your win percentage  which is huge.  Youll rank up so fast.If you want to  avoid feeders there is one way.  Find  others and play team league.,NexusNewbies,d0syil9,1,t5_37o5u
7104554,0,t3_4cuzvw,I have a friend who is American and rather older. He played poorly with no respect to the team no reactions no awareness he would pick solo supports and go v someone while his team dies in a team fight.....I introduced him to Thrall he won like consecutive  matches with him. Thrall for having huge sustain dps escape and frankly effective even if you mash your head on the keyboard.Maybe your friend needs some hero to fit his game style.,NexusNewbies,d1loa23,6,t5_37o5u
7109709,0,t3_4cxy6e, Im pretty sure no.   I cant confirm your numbers right now but another thing to consider is looking at some of the bundles. Decide which heroes you would buy anyway look at a bundle sum up the cost of just the heroes in it you would get anyway and see if the bundle is cheaper. At least when I started there was a bundle that had a higher herocosmetics ratio than most that seemed like a pretty good buy. Its the only real money Ive put into the game.,NexusNewbies,d1m9lt8,1,t5_37o5u

7549503,0,t3_4iplhy,I personally waited a few weeks before spending any money... I just continued to play the heroes that were on free rotation and tried my best to get as many of them to level  for the coins.  After a few weeks of getting free rotation heroes to level  I had coins from games played as well as coins from achieving level  on the heroes and ended up using coins to purchase a few of the free characters I enjoyed playing.  After that I ended up dumping a few bucks on the starter bundle then a few more bucks on another bundle.  I then leveled all those heroes up to  and repeated the process buying the characters that I wanted to play with the coins that I received. ,NexusNewbies,d30cbx3,2,t5_37o5u

7566725,0,t1_d3285b3,Thanks Endiamon! Thats a very in depth reply. The sort of depth I was hoping for. I never considered the fact that a simpler hero will be effective than a harder to play one if both players are of equal skill especially when they are new. I just played an AI match with Abathur to have a look at his play style and its very tempting to siege all game! Though I assume playing a more team orientated build is better.  I think what I should do is change my strategy of play depending on what my team is doing. So if my team is pushing lanes all game should I ignore objectives try to delay the enemy team getting the objective or help push the lane and try and protect my teammates?Illidan does seem to be a hard character to play judging by what Ive seen. Also you didnt mention my KT play so I assume I was average enough to pass muster!,NexusNewbies,d32at8x,1,t5_37o5u

10820065,0,t3_5uneqp,You should be playing him like bw but with more movespeed. Q should be thought of as disengagedefensive more so than  offensive think of it like bws polymorph. You should toggle both speed and healing to help your team position and heal up.

11230296,0,t3_5zrbzk,Mainly you focus on lane pre then group up after  because the objectives get more powerful and the death timers get longer. Grouping keeps you safer from getting picked off and increases your chances of picking others off if they dont group.  Still you always want to clear lanes when you can do so safely and there isnt an objective or something more pressing happening. Usually you can clear a lane nearly instantly as a group or with a hero with good wave clear post .  Its one of the advantages of heroes like Falstad or Dehaka who can split from the team to safely clear a lane and instantly rejoin when needed.,NexusNewbies,df4xthy,1,t5_37o5u
