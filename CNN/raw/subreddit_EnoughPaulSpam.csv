139086,0,t3_1vnh68,FTAgt What few friends realized is where his philosophical quest had brought him. At Penn State he was becoming a dedicated libertarian. He joined the schools Libertarian Club and wore a Ron Paul for President shirt to classes. Mr. Ulbricht was quoted in the schools newspaper The Daily Collegian saying of Mr. Paul theres a lot to learn from him and his message of what it means to be a U.S. citizen and what it means to be a free individual.gt gt By the time Mr. Ulbricht left Penn State his views had taken on a vehemently antitax tone. A friend in Austin said Mr. Ulbrichts politics at the time were more hard core than his own.gt gt Id say Less government but we need the government to build roads  this friend said. But for him even when it came to building roads he felt there ought to be a voluntary basis for that. The point for him wasnt to abolish government. He just thought people should have the ability to opt out of paying taxes.,EnoughPaulSpam,ceu9sll,3,t5_2sir4

8535734,0,t1_d657gfd,In  the Paulbots figured out if they could get themselves elected as delegates they could take over the Iowa GOP.  And they did just that just by hanging around until the end of the caucus the vote for President is basically a meaningless straw poll and was the second to last question.  Everyone outside of a handful of people left after the straw poll not understanding that the delegate votes are what selects the winner.Once they took over things went completely downhill.  They all got into senior leadership positions in the Iowa GOP without having any clue what the state level party actually does.  The state level partys main functions are recruiting candidates fundraising and dispersing the funds to people running on the Republican ticket.First of all they went out and selected complete kooks for candidates if they rcruited a candidate at all for a particular race.  Were talking the chemtrails vaccines cause autism crowd.  After that contributions to the state GOP dried up.  And what money was sitting in the coffers didnt make it to the candidates so these candidates who were running with the promise of party supportfunding were left hanging.  Needless to say it didnt go well and after a little more than a year and after almost bankrupting the party they voted themselves pay raises when they werent trying to decide whether or not to write memos about the Trilateral Commission establishment and Tea Party Republicans got together and threw the idiots out.,EnoughPaulSpam,d68j79l,3,t5_2sir4
