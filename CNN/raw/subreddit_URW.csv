Like force them to give me stuff? do my action have some impact on the world? Is there reputation system or something?,URW,cp6lao3,3,t5_2vwnr
9625881,0,t1_d9zd558,A quick rule of thumb for that is anything iron is really foreignmade and really expensive. The more metal in it the more expensive it is fore example a sword is much more expensive than a spear where only the tip is metal.The only other things that are expensive are things that require hundreds of hours of human labor like nets and pelts and furs which are the main export goods of iron age finland.You can get a general idea of the price of goods by asking people what of my goods do you want in exchange for these items?,URW,d9zl6ms,2,t5_2vwnr
