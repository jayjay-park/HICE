20427,0,t3_1u9pvh,I think thats actually the storm raven but it makes no difference the space wolves have no flyers in their codex. I saw lots of hunters and scouts plus loads of termis for wolf guard squads. Theres definitely some skyclaws there too and some of the best devastators around longfangs. As for the HQ slots you can actually take  and I saw Logan Grimnar Njal Stormcaller another rune priest I think a wolf priest. Loads of vehicles to round out leave you with loads of very solid options.I would say not to bother getting a wolf lord specifically either use Logan as himself or a generic wolf lord or decorate any old tac or termi model until he looks suitably impressive to be called Wolf Lord. Fenrising wolves can be very helpful as fodder or by themselves if you can get them quickly into charge range.

Where is that stated?There are the societal issues that have been discussed but I am looking more at the actual possibility. I am curious about the progenoid making them look like their primarch because that would imply that every marine would look virtually identical depending on what chapter they are in. I dont believe that to be the case too many Space Wolves look different but maybe it creates a situation that makes them have similar characteristics like long hair and facial hair. I wonder how that would apply crossgenders. The wording matters in other words so I would like to see it. I wonder if the similarities between marines in a single chapter would be better explained by the fact they are all recruited from the same planet. ,Warhammer40k,cem711g,2,t5_2rr81

Youre right that Biomancy is a better table but it arguably is the best table in the game so I dont know what to say beyond that.Zoans have options and they have flexibility they certainly took a kick with the loss of the pods but I think some tweaking of the role in the field can make them usable.  Ive been talking with our resident nid player and he has a few build ideas he wants to mess with involving them.  Weve kicked around how to use them quite a bit and now need to see if the ideas hold up in the field.As far as Stealers go Ive seen them used and tend to use them as shock troops.  Much like dropping terminators via Deep Strike into someones backfield it tends tocan cause a huge change in plans.  As cheap as all the rest of things are I believe there will be points to spare to try it.  Im not sure if it will work reliably or if its more of a roll the dice and pray it comes up big.

160732,0,t3_1vxbct,Your wash looks really sloppy. Your colors are okay but they way you overdid it on the wash really does bring the model down. FRET NOT! All this means is that you need to do some more highlighting. You also look like you didnt stay in the lines very well in general. That is something you will pick up as you get better though. The white looks a little clumpy but white is the fuckiest of colors so I personally refuse to use it except for the highest of lights. I always opt for a light grey instead. Much of what I am seeing here might just be a bad photo though. Can you get one with more light? Take a preferably white light source and put a piece of printer paper over it. Now get it about  inches away from the model. Voila! It is not perfect but it gets the job done. ,Warhammer40k,cewqo05,3,t5_2rr81

305597,0,t3_1xkykf,As mentioned you need a commanding unit also known as HQ and two squads of troops. You also get various other units which classify as Elites Fast Attack and Heavy Support. You get a maximum of  HQ  Troops and  of the rest for a basic army with no nonsense like secondary detachments or allies.For Imperial Guard the HQ choices boil down to the Company Command Squad and Lord Commissar. Theres a lot of named characters and heroes but ignore them for now. The CCS is the cheapest out of the box in terms of game points but they have access to a vast arsenal of upgrades and special weapons meaning they can be tailored to work with just about any type of army. Closerange firefighting or longrange support whatever you need and they can be mounted in an APCIFV the Chimera which can also be modified to an extent. The Lord Commissar on the other hand is exclusively a choice for infantryheavy armies. He can take more personal upgrades than the CCS but the Imperial Guard isnt very good single combat so pimping him out is usually not worth it. On the other hand he is an inspiring presence to his troops by virtue of executing them if they cant do their job and scaring the rest into fighting harder.For your troops choices you generally want to stick with the Infantry Platoon or Veteran Squads. Theres also Penal Legionnaires if you want to make an army of scary dudes trying to shank the enemy to death but shanks are largely ineffective in the st millenium. The Platoon is your bread and butter choice like the CCS they get almost endless options and also absolutely crazy numbers. In fact a Platoon is like a miniature army by itself with a command section infantry squads special and heavy weapons support teams and even conscripts for sheer numbers. The drawback is that each soldier while trained to a commendable standard and with more balls than most of us fares poorly against the horrors of the st millenium and theyre not as experienced marksmen as the CCS or Veterans. Still if numbers is your game you cant go wrong with a Platoon.The Veterans on the other hand are more similar to the CCS with superior stats to the average guardsman and lots of options for a squad of ten. Usually they are armed with special weapons such as Melta Guns or Plasma Guns demolitions charges and mounted in either an IFV or support aircraft for mobility. They are fewer in numbers so you need to take good care of them but their more reliable shooting means theyre more effective for a surgical approach to things.Speaking of which your two options for transports are the Chimera IFV which comes with both a powerful rapid fire laser and a heavy machine gun both of which can be swapped out for shorter range flamethrowers if you want to get in the thick of it and toast swathes of enemy infantry and can be given a singleshot long range missile to enhance it in a supporting role. The Chimera can be taken by most squads as an upgrade for a modest sum of points meaning you can have a lot of them for cheap if you mount up your platoons. Theres also the Valkyrie and Vendetta aircraft which come with a much greater range of weapons from rockets and heavy machine guns to armorpuncturing laser cannons. These can not be taken as squad upgrades and instead use Fast Attack slots.The Elites choices of the Imperial Guard is largely overlooked because few if any of the units in it are costeffective. You get a few options like the brutish Ogryn space ogres skulking Ratling Snipers space halflings and Storm Troopers space orphans. Ogryns are largely ignored because they are bad at shooting and not tough enough for close combat to make up for it. Ratlings are taken on occasion and can have their uses but their only saving grace is their fairly modest cost in points. Storm Troopers are like Veterans but they can teleport behind enemy lines to cause havoc. That might sound nice but they cost twice as much as Veterans with half the firepower only marginally improved survivability and they might explode into gory chunks if you try teleporting them because teleportation sucks.The Fast Attack choices start getting better immediately. To start off you have mounted cavalry which is pretty good at charging into things. The problem is that after the initial charge theyre stuck dead in the water and tend to just die making them essentially a suicide unit and suicide is bad for your continued health. Moving on you get two variants of mechanized walkers or Sentinels. Sentinels have quite a few weapons to pick from but their poor shooting abilities makes them more likely to choose volume of fire over raw strength preferring rapid fire lasers automatic cannons and flamethrowers. The Scout variant can deploy behind enemy lines outflanking the enemy and causing havoc taking pot shots at weak enemy rear armor or setting infantry on fire. If you pay a little more the Armored Sentinels lose the ability to outflank but gain additional armor and access to powerful plasma cannons. Unfortunately while an interesting option their price is so bloated they have a very difficult time making their points back.The more reliable Fast Attack choices come in the form of the HellhoundBane WolfDevil Dog fastlight tanks and the ValkyrieVendetta aircraft. Hellhounds are flamethrower tanks with great range excelling at roasting infantry hiding behind cover. Bane Wolves use chemical weapons to corrode armor and melt flesh making them effective against armored and heavy infantry. Devil Dogs have a powerful mediumrange antitank shotgun the unique Melta Cannon which primarily takes out armor but it can cause a lot of hurt to infantry as well. The Valkyrie is a support Aircraft which seems to favor an antiinfantry role and the Vendetta is a tank hunter. The Vendetta is the more popular of the two due to its phenomenal firepower but both of them can be loaded with a squad of troops to deploy wherever they are most needed. Unlike Chimeras though they need to stay on the move so its usually a good idea to drop your guys in cover since they cant hide in or behind their transport vehicle.Finally theres Heavy Support and oh dear is this a long list. You basically get two hulls the Chimera and the Leman Russ. The Chimerabased tanks are usually artillery and support pieces retaining the armor of the base hull but trading the transport capacity for anything from massive longrange cannons colossal mortars cityleveling missiles and aircraftshredding cannons. I wont go into specifics because you have a LOT of options.The Leman Russ also has  variants all of which serve a specific role. By default it gets a massive cannon which chunks infantry and can cause massive damage to vehicles as well but it can take weapons specialized for any role and then augment that role with front and sidemounted weapon sponsons. That being said certain variants including the stock one uses cannons which are so big and powerful the recoil makes operating these auxiliary weapons almost impossible. For example the Punisher variant comes with a strong gatling gunstyle cannon spraying the field with bullets but has relatively low recoil meaning it can be further improved with heavy machine guns for a little extra cost.Usually people go with mechanized veterans and tanks as the core of their army or hordes of infantry with artillery support because these both enhance the other quite well. What is best depends on what you expect to be facing but the Imperial Guard has options to deal with just about anything.Unless they get nerfed in the new codex. Oh shit.,Warhammer40k,cfcfxof,5,t5_2rr81

538184,0,t1_cg1g5fo,Restricted file  Alpha Ulta level Authorization required  Inquisitorial override accepted  Transcription begins  Date of Recording .M  MC Inquisitor you asked to see me?DH Ah yes Sergeant please come in. Dalium Helstorm please to meet you. Please sit down. Theres water if youd like youve had a rough couple of weeks.MC Thank you Inquisitor. Why did you want to see me?DH I just wanted to get your story of what happened down on Onasida.MC It was a bloodbath and possibly a miracle but youll have my full report from McCragge as soon as I file it wont you?DH Yes but I find written reports to be...sterile plus the nature of what you experienced is well known to us and Ive found that its best to fully debrief whoever I can while their memories are still fresh. So tell me what happened.MC Well our initial deployment was fairly routine. There was an uprising on the planet rumors suggested the involvement of the ruinous powers but to what extent they were involved before our arrival is more your jurisdiction than mine maam. We deployed by Thunderhawk to the capital and proceeded to set up a command post in a PDF bunker that had been abandoned when that particular regiment was massacred.DH And just for the record Sergeant who was we?MC My apologies Inquisitor. Our force consisted of  squads from the Imperial Fists th company under Captain Ellian  Squads from the Nova Marines st company under sergeant Piorus  Squad from the Invaders second company under veteran sergeant Killior  Black Templar initiates and neophytes under Chaplain Gellum and his sword bretheren and my own contingent of  squads from the Ultramarines th company under Captain Entarus. We marched to battle with the assistance of  Predators taken from the armouries of the Fists and Invaders  Landraider Crusaders from the arsenal of the Templars  Rhino Transports and one Razorback. Captain Ellian took overall command of the strike force before we translated into realspace.DH Quite comprehensive sergeant please continue.MC After our intial deployment is when things started to get messy. On our first night we confirmed the influence of the ruinous powers when one of the Templar Neophytes was discovered crucified and disembowled on a Star of Chaos. Chaplain Gellum would later theorize that his sacrifice empowered the ritual that called in the enemy but again thats more your department.The second night was when everything went straight to hell. During third watch we recieved frantic communication from the vessels in Orbit they had been beset by a traitor fleet bearing the markings of the Word Bearers. They also advised us that enemy dropships had been dispatched to the planet and we should expect a fight.Within an hour our vessels in orbit had been destroyed or scattered and nearly six hundred Word Bearers were marching on the planetary capital. We attempted to organize the local defenders against them but most were terrified of us never mind the Traitors and the daemons cappering in their midsts. We successfully held the walls for nearly  standard hours before Captain Ellian was brought low in combat with a Bloodthirster. Captain Entarus took command and we fell back from the city in good order. We withdrew through the wilderness under heavy pursuit for the next  days. I assume the details of our engagements during that time are of less interest to you than its eventual climax yes?DH You assume correctly sergeant we can skip the various skirmishes during that time period the details of them in your final report should be quite acceptable.MC Very well. On the th day our force had been reduced to less than two dozen men all of our vehicles had been abandoned and we were low on ammunition and supplies. Just before dusk Captain Entarus was felled by an enemy sniper and I took operational command of the remainder of the force being the most experienced. Which should say something about our state of affairs in itself as Ive only been a sergeant for less than a decade. I resolved that Captain Entarus geneseed would not be sacrificed to the Enemy. I took up his sword and managed to get the Captains body to a nearby strongpoint where we resolved to make our last stand.The first of them to appear I can only assume was their leader. he was clad as a Marine in pitch black armour... no not even pitch black absolutely black so black it was difficult to try and look upon it. He was not wearing a helmet but much of his face was hidden under a hooded robe. The robe was a light blue grey with flame patterns embroidered on it that seemed to move as actual fire. His armour as well was decorated with flame patterns that seemed to move on their own and he carried a beautifully crafted power axe. I trained my weapon on him but felt in my gut that he was not the enemy. Even through fears of warp trickery none of my men could bring themselves to fire upon him.He was still standing just inside our perimeter when the first of the Enemy crested the hill a Berzeker foaming at the mouth and screaming the praises of the blood god. The specter turned calmly as the Word Bearer descended on him but the enemys chainaxe passed through him harmlessly. At this point the man flared like a brilliant nova forcing my autosenses to turn my vision opaque for a moment to avoid damage. When my vision cleared the Berzeker was dead charred to a crisp the strange marine was fully engulfed in flame that didnt harm him in the slightest and there were dozens of his comrades standing beside him  exchanging fire with the line of Word Bearers that charged down the hill towards our position.We left enough men to operate the emplaced heavy weapons and the rest of us sallied forth to join the battle. The fight was viscious but the spectral marines fought more skillfully and ruthlessly than I have ever seen a marine fight. Within  minutes we had routed the Traitors and were running the last of them down. Then word came that a relief fleet had arrived only to find the Traitor vessels lifeless and adrift above the planet. That was yesterday evening.DH Yes similar stories have been reported by the few survivors of the PDF and civilian population weve managed to locate across the planet. And when we boarded the Traitor vessels we found their corridors lifeless blood smeared and charred. I suspect your saviours were at work on those vessels as well. If you  were currious theyre known to the Imperium as The Legion of the Damned.MC Hmm yes I suspected as much. Ive heard rumors of them appearing when a battle is most dire to rescue the loyal forces of the Imperium. But inquisitor...DH Yes?MC The rumors say that the Legion only appears when their actions will save someone or something that is vital to the future survival of the Imperium. Onasida is a farming world with barely a billion people living on it. No great relics or temples they export less food than any other agriworld in this sector they dont even have an Imperial Guard regiment. What on this world could be so vital to the future of the Imperium?DH The ways of the Emperor are mysterious. We may never know why the Legion appeared on this particular world at this particular time. But I believe Ive taken enough of your time for the moment you have to report back to your battle barge Im sure.

577174,0,t3_20qlcp,As a lady I explain Warhammer Fantasy as follows and I expect you could adapt it to K yes yes Im a xenos loving heretic.This is a tactical game. Have you ever played Age of Empires? sidenote the explainee had indeed played AoE You build up your troops and then go to war. You know how when youre actually battling a fellow human and you have to manage where each troop is attacking e.g. position your catapults and order them to hit specific buildings? Warhammer is in effect a slowed down turn based version of the battle instead of using pixels you place actual miniatures representations of your war engines and troops on a big board. Each type of engine or troop or vehicle does different things and each group Tau Imperial Guard Tyranids whatever has different units. Its like choosing the Aztecs vs. the Spaniards for their special unit in AoE but with bigger differences.We build up our troops buy purchasing and assembling miniatures. To make your units stand out on the battlefield and because its fun you paint your units however you want to. ltinsert google images heregt. People end up with really elaborate miniature works of art or simply painted minis as they choose depending on how much they enjoy painting.Take a look at this ltpartially finishedstill in pieces mini.gt When Im finished painting it the unit will do x y z on the battlefield. Im planning to have  of these in the end so I can ltinsert tactic here in simple terms e.g. outflankgt my opponent and win.Does that make sense?ltexplain the grim darkness of the future and your specific armys mission in itgtI realize OP may have just wanted to share his humorous response to his girlfriend but frankly Im all for more women in wargaming.

As theyre escorted out of the building they make a stop in the room. There are a few tables set up with pottery on them random smashable things around the room. They  work out some stress before they go home.

601219,0,t1_cg8lsbv,You have to remember not every unit can run. And the point of the massive distance to walk was assuming the enemy cant get to objectives in time. For scenarios like this ask could dreadmob orks have a fair game against bikedar in this match? or do the orks automatically lose? in this scenario  points of eldar bikes can literally drive up to the center turn one grab every single objective and then turn around and turboboost off the board and end the game. Eldar then get an assured  points. This mission is incredibly polarizing and really should be reworked. The random points doesnt help this at all as now how well you perform has even less of a bearing on the end result.

Easy to do with a knife and file.With regards to your question about DA robes etcRobes are generally reserved for veterans your average line marine wont be wearing them its different in some of the successor chapters. I believe its also common for those initiated into the Inner Circles to wear them but that could be more due to being vets than being in the Inner Circle.Sargents often have a tabard instead of full robes check out the dark vengeance sarg. You can get a Dark Angels upgradeveterans box from GW which has enough parts to make  robed veteran marines and also give you a nice amount of spare bitz to DAifiy your Battleforce marines.The marines in the Dark Vengeance boxed set are great nice details they fit well and you get a bit of everything normal marines Ravenwing bikers and Deathwing Termies.,Warhammer40k,cgc91ts,1,t5_2rr81

I wonder if anyone has hazard striped dice hmm....The only real advise I can offer is always get relatively bright coloured dice. So often Ive seen people get black or dark grey because they look cool... until they drop them on the floor and can never find them again.

705456,0,t1_cgk4qob,The level of precision depends more on the printer itself and if it was a DIY kit like mine how well you put it together. Mines not one of the most accurate printers and it wasnt very well put together but even it can show surface details of about .mm although plastic extruded is always .mm wide as thats the size of the nozzle so mortar between bricks would be very doable.The printer can do layer thickness between .mm fast low resolution great for buildings to .mm slow detailed but theres definitely printers out there that can do higher. The RapMan . had the largest build area of the printers available at the time mm x mm x mm which is what drew me to it as I wanted to print thisMy wallfloor thickness is about .mm and Ive started incorporating buttressing on some of my newer buildings see the radius between the wall and the underside of the floors but Im not certain its nessisary just me being paranoid. Thats a kg weight. The plastic is more than strong enough to hold up a couple of grams worth of miniatures The most important thing to keep in mind when designing stuff to be printed is the process used by the printer. It starts at the bottom and adds layer after layer atop itself until it completes the part. Tensile strength along the same plane as the layers is great as theyre one continuous piece of plastic but against the direction of the layers is quite weak. Its only held together by the bit of melted plastic that fused to the top of the other layer when it was added.The printer builds the part  layer at a time a lot like a CAT scan heres an image of the slicing program converts D cad into coordinates in layers for the printer to follow showing what the layer at Z.mm is going to look like,Warhammer40k,cgkgp4g,2,t5_2rr81

The last list had barely any boyz and too much toys. Trukk boys squads arent going to get far and dont have the numbers to soak hits with their low initiation rating. Need a nob with PK in every boyz squad. Chaos is actually good in melee so your going to need to out number then to win.If you want to footslog you want as many  boyz units as you can while a vehicle based list wants  boyz in each battle wagon. Looted tanks have nice fire power but you gotta be safe with their placement and limit LoS to their ranged AV threats.Terrain is going to be important as you want to limit LoS to maximize your ability to close the gap and flood them with green. Do not play on a naked table or expect to get tabled.I think thrakka is overpriced now so maybe run him as a regular mega armor warboss. Trim the fat and try to squeeze in as many boyz as you can.Maybe try something like this.x battlewagons proxy the trukks as wagons while you test out stuff  shoota boyz  nobz with PK in . Meganobz and warboss in rd. Try to get deffrollas on each and red paint job. Add dakka jets and the looted wagon with boom gun if points allow. Lootas are good as well as more shoota boyz.

I like fire dragons as a good suicide squad pretty much guarunteed to kill a vehicle.  Warp spiders are really nice super fast and potent. I would also recommend pickomg up a melee unit most people would say that striking scorpians are the best definitivly but I personally think it depemds on your metagame if you fight a lot of  saves I recomend howling banshees and if you fight some one with a lot of termies or the like harlequines are the better bet.,Warhammer40k,cis1d4h,1,t5_2rr81

Between the two of you there isnt a solid anti other peoples super heavy except the baneblade. While that sounds fine baneblades wont stand up too well to one properly equipped Titan. If they get first turn you could lose it one shot before invis goes off. I like that synergy but you will have to check with your TOs about casting on enemy models. In my opinion the DA player should focus on drop pod tac squads with meltas or plasmas so you have options to kill the targets that matter on turn one.

1423383,0,t3_2af0po,I cant believe no one has said this but drop the multi meltas and las cannon off the demolisher. If you want to fire the main cannon you are snap shooting the rest of them. I went with hull heavy flamer and when that combo works great since I was never able to hit with a snap fired heavy bolter also if you are so worried about getting immobilized on the punisher I would go with a dozer blade. since most weapons shooting at a Leman russ are probably going to be going for an explode. Also i recommend swapping the sponsoons with multi meltas over the heavy bolters. You have a lot of anti infantry killing but it feels like your anti armorhigh toughness is dependent on a very small number of shots from things. and remember with how much more durable armour is you are looking at only the demolisher and pasks las cannon at causing explode results if you make the changes I recommendAlso listen to uauraenchanted. I have had maybe one game where my wyvern didnt make its points back on turn . that thing will rip through most infantry and does wonders to defend you from horde armies. and the other problem with the aegis is you have no long range artillery heavy weapons teams or the like to stay behind it. the longest range weapons you have are the few heavy bolters spread around some vehicles and the auto cannon and missile launcher in the infantry squads. that is a lot of wasted shooting IMO.,Warhammer40k,ciup5u5,3,t5_2rr81

1600582,0,t3_2cjcqt,I figure I should weigh in as a Tau player and give you some advice.  Someone mentioned spawn. I hate spawn.  They arent very pricey they can keep up with riptides and suits they ignore terrain and have fleet.  So they are fast tough and lots of players who havent seen them before have no idea what they do.  Also at T the riptide cant instant kill them and if they are spread out its really hard to kill more than  a turn.  Once they are in base contact they are all but invincible to tau close combat.  A riptide based by  of them will never get out.  Plasma squad  Meh.  Plasma hurts suits but melta pops them.  Plasma doesnt even deny FnP now so Im alot more willing to duel with a plasma squad than a melta squad.  Also no gets hot.  I hate gets hot.Finally kill the pathfinders first.  Tau shooting is pretty effective unsupported but it is devistating with markerlights.  ,Warhammer40k,cjgx7vg,1,t5_2rr81

As per this threads original post which you have kindly deleted you are really depressed and invested in your work. You keep saying stuff like it is you that is going out. You call this a safe space or not. Tons of you comments genuinely sound like you think you area martyr and they suggest that you are extensively emotionally invested as a person with this hobby.

This really isnt healthy man. I am serious. I am not trying to insult you this really isnt healthy. This is not a reasonable course of action. You need to step back take some breaths and stop investing yourself so much in this. Some of my comments were very cruel but they really should not have affected you so deeply.

1708109,0,t3_2dy447,Ive enjoyed Tau as my first army.    The thing I truly enjoy about them is being able to adapt to just about anything a person brings to the table.  I find it personally satisfying when I can find and exploit the weaknesses in another army.  Tau Elite Fast Attack Heavy Support and HQ are all highly adaptive.    Tau will play how you want to play them unless you love hitting people with hammers and swords and axes and gun butts Tau dont do that.  Ive been lucky and had a drone or two win the assault but it is crazy rare.  Personally I try to balance my play style in a k game I have two or three units that gun line and the rest move about the board pressing objectives.  Lazy Tau players just gun line and disgruntled losers whine about Tau being nothing but gun line.    Tau can easily compete at the  point range.  It is a little harder at  but still possible.  As for decent price I cant say Ive only been playing for less than a year and dont know how box sticker prices compare to other armies.    I started with straight Tau Empire but have moved to Farsight Enclave and love it.    Other armies to try?  Id wait for the new Necron and Grey Knight codices to drop and see if the store will let you leaf through them.  ,Warhammer40k,cjugw0q,1,t5_2rr81

2259810,0,t1_clqtzr1,Please dont take this as an attack Im just trying to be informative...but I dont think you realize how much it really costs to make these models. I work in an industrial automotive plant as a department supervisor. My shop has a large molding department  vertical presses and something horizontal presses. The presses are huge. They cost a lot. They break down a lot. They use a ton of electricity. And the resin material used in them is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. In my shop we make some pretty small parts but nothing as detailed or intricate as GWs models. I believe GW uses Sandretto presses which are very expensive. Then you have to take into account the mold making process. You have to sculpt the model then put it into a CAD program and then send it off to usually and external company to precision machine your mold which also isnt cheap before you can start production. Its a process that takes months of planning. Its not just a few corporate bigwigs sitting around a table. There are engineers machinists and a whole plant of people like you and I making these products. Their prices suck. I agree. Its expensive and can be a huge deterrent. But when you understand the process behind injection molding it seems a little bit more reasonable. ,Warhammer40k,clr17r4,3,t5_2rr81

As a heavy weapons platform with the lascannons the Crazed roll will be beneficial rd of the time detrimental rd and have more or less no effect for the final rd alot of players dislike this randomness but I find it seldom makes a difference in my games.I havent fielded chosen like what you have suggested before personally I am a big fan of boyz before toyz and would drop it down to  plas per squad and probably even drop the powerfist to get more numbers elsewhere see afore mentioned helcult   Also this is alot of antiMEQ here may want some different weapon options depending on the local meta I know an ork player that would relish that lack of flamers.Bikes are fine good anti armor with meltas that can get to where they are needed quickly. Personally I dont run them as  wound at their points cost is a pricey loss but they do the trick.Baledrake is still brilliant nothing to add here.My fiends are all maulers so no real advice I can give as to how this slot will go.Overall I cant see this list being blown out of the water every game and for a fluffy CSM army I think that is about all you can hope for.,Warhammer40k,cmb96m3,3,t5_2rr81

Hell probably get killed before he can punch anything with his power fist anyway especially without an invuln save. The Vanguards are better off being more melta assault marines I say  what good are they as being veterans without sweet war gear? even if they still have heroic intervention  thats sort of a gimmick to me. Meltas are more reliable I feel. Captain is better taking a storm shield than a weapon if thats what you have points for  they could fail a save versus his chainsword and if he gets into a challenge against a power weapon he is in a really bad way.I dont know if the scouts need cloaks because they may not get shot all game  you have more interesting stuff to shoot and if he shoots the scouts thats fine with you. If they face a really bad turn of shooting you can go to ground get the better save soak it up and miss the shooting. If any of them survived it will have meant a wasted action for you opponent and were in business.can you find a way to get that second heavy weapon in the Tac squad? A heavy flamer in that squad could hurt a couple of feelings consider it could be fired out of the rhino hatch.This is just sort of what I think not the only way you should play. Just a few ideas. think about this stuff. As a final point  Plasma guns would help you knock off his grey knights. you can get  shots per weapon when he inevitably gets close enough to you.

Its best use is not on foot or for troops but to give vehicles a very strong defense they would normally never be able to get and for  points you can easily spread this to multiple units.  Ravenwing is the main spot where it shines as you have the speed to keep up with other units its pretty bad otherwise I agree terminators dont need it and greenwing its too small to make a difference.,Warhammer40k,co7o812,1,t5_2rr81

They just arent. They are no longer amazing as a single force they require allies to function in a tournament meta mainly due to losing Psybolt Ammunition Servo Skulls Grenades and many characters from the last codex. As far as fun goes theyre totally fine on their own you can definitely win games running pure Grey Knight lists.The only units in the codex that are great for their price are Librarians Dreadknights Terminators Purifiers amp Draigo. There are plenty of good units for their price but the ones previously listed are the only truly great ones.And another thingIf you like the look or fluff or playstyle of an army thats considered cheesy who cares? Youre playing the army because YOU like it not because you give  shits about what any other player thinks of you due to army choice.Personally I love Paladins. Cant get enough of em. I love running  tanky dudes at pts but thats me. My list is typically something like thisNemesis Strike ForceBrother Captain SternLibrarian  Mastery Level Dreadnought   AutocannonsDreadnought   Autocannons Paladins  Apothecary  Psycannons Strike Grey Knights Strike Grey KnightsStormravenDreadknight  Greatsword Teleporter Incinerator PsycannonDraigoIts anything but optimized but I like it so thats what I run when I want a fun game.

If you need help figuring out what to run Id be glad to help!PS The Nemesis Vanguard Box Set is a good way to start a Grey Knight Army but I wouldnt build the models as advertised. Id definitely magnetize the Terminators because the loadouts youll want to run will constantly change as you play. Id build all of the Grey Knights in Power Armor as Strike Squads because theyre great cheap troops. Id build the Dreadknight with a Greatsword an Incinerator and a Psycannon. Now if you do buy the box youll need an HQ.

Tank hunters should be given missile pods and fusion blasters with a captain that has a Petruide Engram Nanochip for the tank hunter and monster hunter special rule. Suits that are supposed to take out heavy infantry should take two plasma rifles each and Capt with a Multi Spectrum Sensor Suite and a Command and Control node. Artillery platform suits should take a total of  missile pods and horde killers should take  burst cannons. Ditch the kroot hound. Widdle the FW team to  per. Ditch some Stealth Team units. Put them in those SuitsThe Broadsides you just need to give them a task. If you want them to be up front and in someone face give them all HYMP and have your Riptide keeps its Ion Accelerator Cannon and give your Riptide skyfire if you want your Broadsides to be antiair antimonsterous creatures antivehicles and sit in the back and snipe things to dust give them HRR and skyfire and your Riptide a heavy burst cannon and make your Riptide go punch things.

3390101,0,t3_2z03nh,Im no expert and there are youtube guides with more info but when I painted my leviathan fleet I used a similar color guide.Greens Id go with Caliban green yes I know its dark but you wont really see it this is the color you want to base eveything you want green. The come in and add the warpstone green for color and the moot green for highlights.Black Pretty self explainitory and your spot on with the basing the claws and adding red on top. Id go one further and say do the carapaces black as well and add purple over it.Pinks and reds Pink Screaming bell for the base color Emp children for highlights Red Mephioston red with some black showing through and highlight with wild rider red and evil sun scarlet.Purples Depending on how dark you wanna go Id say paint carapace black then paint the Naggaroth night over the black. Uses Xerxes Purple and genestealer purple to highlight.Fleshy Areas Personally Id bas it all white then wash it with either Serapham Sepia or Reikland Fleshshade. Then come back and do a heavy drybrush of Ulthuan Grey followed by a lighter drybrush of white scar. You could even base the flesh with Celestra grey and then do a wash and add highlights.Secret to painting a good white is to use really light grey with white highlight instead of just whiteThas pretty much it The first few will take a little to get the technique right but once you get it youll rock out a whole unit or MC in no time.

3530073,0,t1_cpuiffx,That is what came to mind when I read this.gt Perhaps the most unusual and significant feature of Cadia are the mysterious Pylons structures of unknown origin that predate the planets colonization by man. Five thousand eight hundred and ten intact Pylons are spread out across the surface of Cadia with a further two thousand either buried or in various states of disrepair. No two are identical in design but each one rises to precisely half a kilometer in height and extends a quarterkilometer into the ground. Each Pylon also features slim winding tunnels machined into them each one no wider than a mans head and exactly two hundred and fifty meters long.bgtgt Efforts by the Adeptus Mechanicus to study the Pylons has failed miserably as their impenetrable surfaces are totally impenetrable to scanning by auspex and efforts to map the tunnels via Servitors have resulted in missing probes. However it is widely believed that they are the reason for the existence of the Cadian Gate in the first place.b During the th Black Crusade as the warp storm Baphomael expanded to engulf the edges of the Cadian System the Pylons simultaneously began resonating at an almost imperceptible vibration and microscopic fractures began appearing on their surface. It was discovered that they were resonating at an amplitude similar to that produced by a Gellar Field in their effort to fight back against the encroaching storm.d  source,Warhammer40k,cpunhtc,3,t5_2rr81

3647106,0,t3_32464i,i primed mine black two thin coats of caliban green for good coverage two thin coats of warpstone glow for coverage nuln oil over the whole thing then i took my detail brush and really darkened up all the crevices with nuln oil multiple layers here got the shadows nice and dark. once that was complete i went back over the green areas mainly flat panels this is on tac squads to brighten the model back up.the result is a very emerald vibrant green without it being cartoony like you see most salamanders painted like the table of painters salamanders linked here.  i really really dislike the slime goo bright yellowgreen salamanders i prefer more of a true green.  I do all the Aquila and shoulder pad trim in bronze.most of my tac squad members have no helms to show off there ebony skin pigmentation with varying eye colors glowing bright red to an orangy red.i also use tamyia gloss black paint for the armor joints where the body glove shows through.  i use the gloss instead of using a flat black because i like how the light catches it when its dry you dont need to highlight it.  it also gives good contrast.  this is totally personal preference though and the satin varnish i put over the models usually tones it down a bit anyway. for edge highlighting i mix the warpstone glow with a little bit of white scar and add more white scar to the mix as i feel necessary.  like i said earlier i really dislike the yellow green slimey salamanders look so no yellow here.  i basically get it to the point right before it turns into like a minty green.,Warhammer40k,cq7zwzi,3,t5_2rr81

3654990,0,t3_328kz6,First thing is you might want to remove the individual points costs of upgrades etc. from your post its against the sub rules.Dont bother with stranglewebs spike rifles or spinefists. Fleshborers and devourers are the only thing you need to think about with termagants usually either all fleshborers or some devourers with fleshborers at meatshields for them. Certainly dont bother giving them upgrades like adrenal glands when those points could just buy you more gaunts.The same goes for hormagaunts for what youre paying for the adrenal glands and toxin sacs you get get loads more hormagaunts.Again the same on Gargoyles. No upgrades just more guys. If the upgrades were cheaper they would be tempting but at their current prices theres no point when you could have more.Normal carnifexes should have two sets of brainleech devourers for firepower as they move up. If you want to go the battering ram route use the stonecrusher carnifex rules from Imperial Armour Volume  The Anphelion Project Second Edition. Theyre tough and they hit like a train. You dont have to buy the Forgeworld model you can easily convert a standard carnifex model to look like a stonecrusher. It would be worth having two carnifexes one isnt generally enough and your army lacks tankbusting power.Rending claws are good for raveners but dont bother with guns. They want to get into close combat as soon as possible and shooting the enemy is going to put them further away from you which will make it harder for you to charge them.Lictors are only good in large numbers with mawlocs otherwise dont bother. They dont do anything useful except in a very specific type of list.Swarmlords are decent but need tyrant guard to stand a chance of making it to the enemy. For this reason save him for higher points games like pts or higher and go for a cheaper HQ until then. I would advise getting a flying Hive Tyrant as they dont require expensive tyrant guard to keep them safe and provide antiair and antimost things with dual brainleech devourers.,Warhammer40k,cq8w7zz,10,t5_2rr81

3685202,0,t1_cpq92qc,RelicThe relic the Emperors Children have access to is the Lucid Blade. These are blades that seemed to possess a level of sentience which enhanced the users own ability with a blade. What does this mean practically. Well practically it means that you have a power sword with  S and a rule called Master Parry which means that you can sacrifice attacks for invulnerable save improvements.  attack improves your invulnerable save by   attacks improves it by  etc. Now the cost. It is one of the more middle of the road costed relics. Now a normal Power Sword costs  points less than this so to justify that with have the  S and the funky rule.On a Centurion to give him a  in combat you have to sacrifice all your attacks since its a specialist weapon and buy a refractor field. Now on the one hand this means you get no attacks. On the other hand for  points if you buy nothing else but the refractor field and the relic you could just troll high cost characters some Primarchs even with a  point character that just wont die. If you the put him in a really killy unit they can take care of you opponents retinue whilst you stall with your bare bones centurion until finally the wounds spill over onto the character youre challenging or until you route them an cut them down. The other option would realistically be to put it on a Praetor with a Paragon Blade and just swapping between the two. If you give him an Iron Halo you either get  attacks at AP  with a  or  attacks at AP  with a . However thatll run you  points as an absolute minimum. Now the really important question is it worth the points? Maybe. As a beatstick weapon its not great but it has great potential at letting you tarpit you opponents most killy characterunit for a while. If you can get FnP or Endurance on the character carrying it then hes not going to be going anywhere for a while. My opinion is that you are better off throwing relic on a cheap Centurion artificer armour  boarding shield  sonic shriekers maybe and putting him in a killy unittarpit unit and hurling it at your opponents biggest melee threat and just holding it down. Sure hell probably die but if your  point character can hold up a  point character while the rest of your army kills his I say its a noble sacrifice and one worth his points.,Warhammer40k,cqcc5v6,1,t5_2rr81

Which by going to contact the Emperor caused Tzeench canceled the cure. Due to Magnus damaging the webway portal the Emperor sent the Space Wolves to arrest Magnus not siege the place. Magnus was willing to accept his punishment but the Thousand Sons refused to stand down. They fought the Wolves while Magnus refused to fight. The Sons feeling abandoned resorted to use of the warp which now that Tzeench had taken back the cure caused mutations to run rampant within the ranks of the Sons. This branded them traitors due to the events at the Trial of Magnus. So pretty much they were branded traitors because they tried to do the right thing.,Warhammer40k,cqekrn9,5,t5_2rr81

3822784,0,t1_cqrzazz,  I get that they are my own and I can pretty much do as I please however in a lot of the forums it seems that the general consensus is that basing a new chapter off of a traitor legion is not an ok thing to do and I dont understand why.    I was wanting to base a chapter off of the emperors children legion as I like their tactics and wargear. For my backstory I was going to have them be the remnants of a company that was nearly wiped out and was left behind on a recently conquered world to replenish their losses before setting out to rejoin the rest of the legion. When the Horus heresy struck however they were still separated from the main force of their legion and were picked up by a loyalist chapter following the drop site massacre. After being brought back to terra for judgement the majority were deemed pure but were forced to undergo centuries of memory alteration before being allowed to return to the imperium obviously the impure marines were destroyed. They were allowed to maintain their legions tactics and wargear but were made to believe that they descended from the nd legion and were sent on a penance crusade for their failure to discover their primarch and were forced to keep their existence secret. While on their crusade they made a name for themselves amongst the lords of terra as being particularly effective against the orks due to their propensity for seeking out challenging and slaying war bosses in single combat. Now with the ever growing ork threat it has been deemed necessary to return the chapter to the imperium in order to bolster its defenses against the green tide.    Anyway thats what I had in mind for my chapter. I want to make sure before spending a bunch of money and time on converting emperors children and marine models to my chapter that I would actually be able to play them like that.,Warhammer40k,cqs12ph,1,t5_2rr81

3840062,0,t1_cqtxkhm,First off bottom part is not pointless either you like where GW is going or the previous meta was better. I did not say jump ship I said to play a previous less codex creep edition of K with more balance. Eldar th edition has the same units as the th edition codex? I mean to say if k was once better why not play that edition if th is broken. Why does GW need to keep releasing codices?And yes I meant underbought. that is definitely true but not bad either. It diversifies the models that each army plays with causing matches to have more diversity. Would like to constantly play serpent spam. Do you want to play against competitive combat armies. This new eldar book allows for lots of competitive lists. And even the most competitive lists can be very different in the eldar codex bike heavy wraith heavy psyker heavy and IMO aspect heavy but that is debatable or some of each. Next yes k is a  but it could be  that could happen in th who knows these are just benchmark numbers if BS  means you hit on a  the dice roll dictates odds and the number indicates the dice roll result needed now if GW messes with dice say d or d then you are right . The problem comes when every single army has access to rerolling misses ridiculous saves whatever it may be. The problem with this is eldar farseer jetbikes have been able to achieve a  coverarmor and  invuln all with rerolls for the past  editions the rules are no more compicated for eldar is that not compicated enough? Necrons recieve a  reanimation  in formation or with res orb with a modifier for Dweapons and instant death basically acts like a feel no pain with reroll abilities on the res orb. rd edition necrons are just as complicated. You got a  reanimation modified to a  with res. orb I believe. If the model suffered instant death or was hit by a power weapon reanimation D weapons too but those were only in apocalypse back then was lost and could not reanimate. If a model that got its reanimation fails an armor save it was left on the board where it was. Any fallen necron warrior on the board within  inches of a unit of warriors can reanimate into that necron unit. In this sense if I wip a complete unit of necron warriors they could reanimate into another squad but my opponent would have to see how many models from the downed unit were within six inches of the living unit. The rules that you seem to take issue with have been added in necron and eldar codices just to buff units and are no more complex your argument does not hold. Decurion gives a  instead of a  reanimation protocol not more complex and Craftworld Host actually simplifies the game as I no longer have to roll a d to run the game is quicker in that case. The aspect formation just gives a  to WS or BS again no more complex. The flyer formation just gives  cover basically a jink save no more complex. It is not going to be incredibly tedious. It is just as tedious as before but now we have D weapons that remove models so you dont get all those complicated rules anyways.They dont have the luxury of upping the average standard like a lot of games do Yes they do that is why we are having this discussion they gave Wraiths Dweapons think some LoL or Hearthstone update which has a broken character or card. However you are right in the long run sense what happens in the next eldar codex will bladestorm become D. Sadly I dont know what the next iteration of eldar could look like how they could be buff without slowly moving to WS BS S etc.. I would encourage you to look at second edition warhammer k rst if you want and on I did a couple year back it gave perspective on what GW has been doing for the past  years. Everything GW is doing Dweapons and high S is to get ready to put out or GMC and Superheavies basically integrate forgeworld and GW into one company. This has been slowly happening for the past  years. The Tyranid Dominatrix is supposed to be released in January or so the rumors go. And I think it will be a GMC because the wraithknight is one. Maybe when more GMCs get intoduced we will see T and S I am over exaggerating here. Anywas GW wants a game where every army can deal with these big scary units that they want to put in the gamethat is why the buffs. If you dont want GW to make a game with superheavies and GMC then you dont need to play with them. However other units will be buffed regardless so GMC and Superheavies can be dealt with.,Warhammer40k,cqu01dr,-1,t5_2rr81
3840771,0,t1_cqu1fh7,But they arent choosing the target. While I probably wouldnt be making that kind of point against another player charging at me with Warpspiders I can easily see it happen.  You make the choice yeah but if people are already at the point of bending over to look at words closely I think the rules say that you choose to declare overwatch or not since assault charges need to be declared and resolved one after another you cant say the defender is choosing which target to fire overwatch at.

The reason why Id assume that you need to resolve each hit at a time because  like I said if you just roll them all and there is for example two glances and a pen then in which order did they happen?

Carnifexes and flying hive tyrants were also popular.So you had huge units killing everything on the board and whatever filler to take objectives be used as meatshield and whatnot.Other was to swarm the enemy with gaunts. if you rolls on s and you roll  on them youre BOUND to hit something.Prefered the former due to having less models to paint. And man did I get rekt over and over. And in th edition they nerfed smash. That was the final straw for me.lots of people find them weak and sadly I must agree that I got desperate to the point of selling the army just to win more..Lots of people like to blame a writer of GW for their weak codex but thats a story for another day.TLDR  Same position as you  years ago.

4361116,0,t3_3axzoq,Normally if a model is equipped with multiple CCWs you choose which weapon and make all of your attacks with it. You cannot divide that models attacks between weapons unless some crazy special rule allows it Im only aware of one character that has such a rule and hes a Forgeworld k.  For a squad youd do this on a modelbymodel basis creating groups of weapons. Youd then roll to hit and wound all weapons in that group simultaneously at the appropriate initiative step.ampnbspSo for example  if my squad of  terminators charges your unit and all  are equipped with  thunder hammer and  lightning claw I could nominate that  strike with hammers and  strike with claws creating two separate pools of attacks of  hammer attacks  attacks base  charge  extra weapon x  models and  claw attacks. Alternatively I could choose all  to use hammers all  to use claws or any other combo ampnbspHowever as many others have already pointed out in your specific case pistols do not use their shooting profile in melee. They instead default to a generic ccw profile. You could still choose to use them but they would be a vastly inferior weapon than the voidblade.,Warhammer40k,csh8clt,3,t5_2rr81
4367464,0,t3_3b1ea3,If you are in a big enough game things that remove models from play and not instant death work well. Things like a Knight Stomp attack rolling a  will clean them out.Or things that stack multi wounds like a D weapon and force just reanimation saves.Also reanimation saves when you are rolling with AP or better are almost like invuln saves. Spamming weapons that negate cover andor provide obscene numbers of hits is a solid solution. Hint Hflamers on tacs...its cheap and it works.As for Quantum shielding not ion shielding run any high tier AT weapon really... Unless Im missing something its just an AV  protective shield that gets burned out if you roll a pen. They still suffer the vehicle damage effects unlike a void shield Things with armourbane or melta or lance not really sure about lance USR rules will make swiss cheese out of it. Pod sternguard running with  meltas combi or standard or mix and match should be good enough to break it. Hell  pts buys you a  x melta  x inferno pistol drop pod assault squad. That thing should do the trick to for cheap. ,Warhammer40k,cshy5av,6,t5_2rr81

Any eldar necron space marine or tau player would literally have a hard time making a list that couldnt beat this one. Thats not your fault its just a product of a very old codex that was mediocre when it launched. This is fine for friendly games but dont expect easy wins.I would agree about the MoT on cultists. Not worth the points.Also look into the hellcult formation. If youre bringing a helbrute its a great way to keep both it and the cultists alive. Theres a couple spots you can trim points here. Combi bolter on the sorc isnt necessary. Also take a look at the termies. What are you gonna do with them? Footslogging termies are no bueno and havocs are way better at ranged for a lot less points. Consider deep striking the termies with the sorcerer and giving them all combi meltas and ditching the reaper. That way you have a pretty solid tankbuster unit that the sorcerer can maybe keep aliveNot sure if you were going to but DO NOT give the sorcerer the mark of tzeentch. Its a trap. The invuln boost is nice and its fluffy and you get a free power but dont fall for it. Youre paying all those points to get a psyker and having to roll a power on that godawful tzeentch table neuters him to the point where you should just take a lord instead. Plus ahriman already lets you take sons as troops.And its pretty commonly accepted that you should never footslog marines.

4583327,0,t3_3dsrfv,Well I cant tell you how to play your BA but I can explain what this edition has been like recently and the direction GW is moving with k. Ever since the Necron release formations have been the focus of the codex.  If you take X Y and Z you get soandso bonuses.  For Necrons its a  reanimation protocol move through cover and relentless.  For Space Marines its access to Tactical Doctrines the ultramarines chapter tactics of e.  For Dark Angels its overwatch at full ballistic still.  Both CSM and CDA also have Battle Companies  captain  chaplain  tactical squads  assault  devastators minimum to unlock the same bonuses as well as free transports rhinos Razorbacks or drop pods for the battle company.  Pretty sweet right?So all of these new codexes have a lot of bonus power power that used to be reserved for upgrades that cost a decent number of points.  The idea is that these formations have units that people dont usually use like Assault Marines in the DA dex that are weak and count as a tax for the bonuses that the formations unlock.  It is bringing in a lot of fluffy armies that are also amazingly competitive but it leaves older codexes in the dust.  In a way most of e has become this formationabusing game of lots of MSUs and lots of special rules and you end up having a good points advantage from the get go.  Since most people dont have that many transports battle companies are not too common in casual play.  The game IMO is pretty close to how it was in early e.  Lots of shooting lots of killing happening turns  and a lot of tabling by turn .  The game is still super killy with some solid meta game.  My local LGS are Knights imperial and wraith lots of fliers for Nids and BA and TWC Space Wolves  Bike assault armies for White Scars and Ravenwing.  Lots of alpha strike turn  lots of super killy  hard to deathstars.  ,Warhammer40k,ct8bw62,1,t5_2rr81

4597213,0,t1_ct9wujv,Its not actually unfluffy. There are several instances in the fluff of Eldar and Dark Eldar working together.

They may not always get along but they prefer each other to everyone else.There are plenty of other cases where the ally table is a bit wishywashy. For instance the Space Wolves and Dark Angels both dislike the Inquisition but they are still battle brothers. And in most cases they would still cooperate if they needed to even though they arent exactly on great terms.Finally EldarDE allies are the best way to play a fluffy Eldar piratescorsair list without using the Forgeworld list.,Warhammer40k,cta2icx,3,t5_2rr81

4615648,0,t3_3e7xqn,Well youre falling into the standard new space marine player trap which is HOLY SHIT look at all these rules look at all this stuff I want it I want it ALL!!!Heres a few things to consider heavy bolters suck. Just math wise they really want to be hitting models that are like TT because of their high strength but theyre only AP. Most targets that are that tough sport at least  armor. Also putting them in marine squads extra sucks because they cant really move and shoot. I find that heavy weapons are almost never useful in Tactical Squadsstick with special weapons like Meltaguns or Plasma Guns that allow the squad flexibility rather than limiting them.  spend those extra points on your dread with some kinda weapon option. Want the assault cannon? Toss a missile launcher in there too and make him venerable for the BS. Want to mash stuff in close combat? Give him a Multimelta or Lascannon to punch holes in things.  Transport while it is ungodly expensive money wise I dont envy you poor poor Aussies with your sadistic prices is rally important game wise for marines.

4656188,0,t1_cth7fim,I think k has always been a more profit friendly game. It works well at any scale so that why not pick up a few units of x faction? thought has always been present. Its just easier to start new armies in k because its less of a commitment.And now theyve baked that right into the rules with unbound armies and formations. Youre right formations  are more upselling tools than actual gameplay enhancing rules. Buy a big box and get a silly bonus! Not to say these arent fun or fluffy but its the most direct form of paytowin or at least get a huge leg up! that weve seen from GW yet.So between ks monetization friendly and accessible game system I doubt well see any k AoS situation soon. k still brings in new players and existing players continuously buy new units or start new armies. The new unbound and formation gimmicks help spur this on. If anything well probably just see more gimmicks hopefully in a more sustainable fashion than the terrible ones they rolled out for WHFB in its dying days.AoS was a somewhat desperate move to create an accessible and profitable game based on a popular if financially unviable IP. They werent going to abandon all their copyrighted material theyve invested in for decades but they sure werent going to continue business as usual for the sake of the fans. Im not sure if AoS was the right move but Im sure glad they made a move.,Warhammer40k,cthgz6w,2,t5_2rr81

4681893,0,t1_ctkkuxv,Canonically as part of the foundation of the Imperium before the Great Crusade the Emperor decreed that all religions and gods and spooks and spectres and supernatural things were false and to be dismissed as superstition. This was called the Imperial Truth. The HH series covers this many times to different degrees as the story unfolds.  Much of the tragedy and irony permeating the canon is tied up with this core part of the fiction. I think it an especially good move narratively because it tickles at core problems and chunks of our history and discoveries and paradigms out here in reality.For me it actually serves to highlight how ridiculous the concept of supernatural is in fiction or otherwise.

Also consider having one be a double burst guy for some extra shots. You wont be running into much heavy armor at .Shave some points by making  or  of the marker drones attached to the commander rather than part of a unit.  Attached drones are  points cheaper than unit drones.Swap the thruster for a target lock and find a way to get a second missile pod on that commander maybe  less drone? They hit on s with Marky Mark. He then gets his  missiles at one target while the drones can light up another. Hit and run isnt really necessary cuz you dont want them getting anywhere near anything anyways.Missileside is better than railside always.  s shot vs  s? Easy choice. Use the fusion guys for heavy armor which you wont see much of at . Without melta special rule and only  shot rail broadsides arent really good at anything that missiles or fusion dont do better. You wont ever use railsides at higher points values unless the new codex buffs them big time. They used to be amazing cuz they were s but now at s they are bad I would only consider railsides against Deathwing Grey Knights or a fellow Farsight Enclaves player.Farsight lists are tough at under  because each unit is so expensive and theres only so far you can scale down these units and keep them effective. Youll have to sacrifice having something in order to keep everyone effective or cut each unit to where none are effective. ,Warhammer40k,cu64xrq,1,t5_2rr81

Other Chapters lack HitampRun so their Chaplains can be tar pitted by blobs and resilient troops.  That makes the bike the best option for those two Chapters. For other Chapters it is difficult to find a good place for them.  I have seen Battle Company players put the Chaplain in with Grav Cents in a pod to soak wounds  and grant fearless.  Others run it with their Company Master Librarian and a Tac squad in a Drop Pod to have a pseudoDeath Star to harass back lines.  Personally Im going to try Assault Marines  PF Chaplain  PF Company Master in a Pod.  That new Interrogator Chaplain for the DA is just so beautiful.

The side skirt bits make a PERFECT meganob bodytrim the extra bits off and turn them so the long edge is parallel with the orks torso the hole is a sleeve and the short edge juts out backwards over his shoulder. Then you can easily plate up the top and back to get that distinctive meganob profile.

They havent really changed much from th edition other than rebalancing and all the new space marine goodness.  You can still do  man squads and sword brethren and emperors champions.

I like playing those  point games where Im rocking like  gants  gaunts a handful of genestealers and some venomthropes as the base of my army. Add synapse to flavor an MC or two maybe a swarmlord whatever. The swarm is the delivery system for the rest of your army. Because hormagaunts have this amusing fact of life they still rape things when theyre out of synapse. So if you dont deal with them theyre going to eat things.

You had individually balanced wargear great modelling opportunities with miniless characters everything.Compare it to thth edition  gutted from any slot swaps armory dumbest and most cumbersome system from ancient times replaced individual choice and half of the options was lost everyone who didnt have mini disappeared extra needless complexity creped in does this unit have sergeant? if so what type does he have any relics or traits etc special rules were lost most of builds stopped working we were left with dropcenturions who totally by accident were this big new expensive nonkitbashable box and gravspam as only viable tactics.You say th edition was bad on example of Chaos and DA  I beg you pardon? These were bad codices from streamlining period of th edition. Bad precisely because they were gutted and most of the fluff was ripped out with power klaw.

I planned to make small fluffy army as alies  Inquisitor Valeria some Inquisitorial Stormtroopers Chimeras GK terminators and Mordrak. Guess how many of these units made it to new Codex? One.

Its easy to go crazy with spray paint trying to cover every area.  What they will show you is that you always make smooth even passes over the models from about a foot away.  Never stop moving your hand when you are painting them.  And its best to paint a side and let it dry for about  minutes before flipping the model to get another side of it.

5843917,0,t1_cxkdkx2,This is the case but it is not that hard to just sidestep that guy. Indirect fire ordnance often circumvents them too. Also it is a minimum  point investment. They seem to work best when you invest in gear to maximize their attacks and that makes them expensive as hell in addition to the exposed Warlord. Most people will go all in with this unit and add Iron Priests and lots of extra wolves to it. The best thing you can do is use terrain IMO  it is not uncommon for the Twolves to have to take tons of dangerous terrain tests throughout the game in my experiences and those chip away at the wounds en route. Remember all this big talk about Twolves is also from the perspective of Death Stars with things like allied Biker Librarians and  extra Cyberwolf wounds and   save characters attached. Alone a Thunderwolf unit is a lot easier to handle and if you are fighting one of these death star style ones your best bet is to feed it something to slow it down while you obliterate the rest of the army.,Warhammer40k,cxlnwwb,1,t5_2rr81

5853441,0,t3_3vbcm2,As everyone else was saying the emperor is an idiot. I have a serious issue with most of the Heresy books a lot of the stories read like fan fiction rather than stories crafted by expert story tellers. You pick up a daemon blade boom youre corrupted. The laziest plot devices ever. You have worse daddy issues than a goth teen despite of being a superduper human Primarch? Seriously? To be honest only the fall of the Dark Angels it has a very amazing greek tragedylike feel to it the fate of the Thousand Sons Word Beares World Eaters and the Alpha Legion make any sense at all. Out of the novels all the novels written by DembinskyBowden most by Abnet are readable OK there are others too but not many. Most the rest of the books are frankly rubbish displaying cardboard cutout characters dubious motivations and improbable plots which conflict with the inner logic of the whole inbook universe. I was really sad they bought back Loken for example. They really did a sorry job with him. The Battle for the Abyss was especially stupid. What annoys me is that they add less and less in real time the Heresy would have been over and these books are still dragging it out.Anyhow our friend the emperor steals his powers from the sentient beings of the Warp. He makes a pact with them so he gets power to conquer Terra craft the Primarchs and start his crusade and then he betrays them. Very smart. Apparently he was not allpowerful before traveling to that little planet cant remember its name from the Vengeful Spirit novel where he could set up a meeting with them. This obviously pisses them off. Now if you fuck with a mobster you will tell this to your sons to warn them that the mob is coming after you and your entire family. He does just the opposite leaving everyone totally unprepared to what is waiting for them. And it is utter stupidity to believe they wont get exposed to the Warp sooner or later in some form. Moreover he acts like a god he looks like a god apparently he could change the way people perceive him so its his damned fault and then he claims he is not one. Sure. And your son looks like a freaking angel. Lorgar had a point in this he also had a valid point that for  of years his worship was fine. Deliberately blinding the empire to the most fundamental truth is just idiotic. He also behaves like a dick. If Hitler could have a word with him hed suggest that the emperor took back a notch with all the genocide and conquest. You dont unify humanity with a sword also a good point Lorgar makes. You also do not exterminate everyone else because they are not human. Thats just tasteless. In many respects you cant feel for the good guys because they are not good at all. They are just as bad as the evil Chaos Astrates its hard to sympathise with them. Or the eldar who are also dicks. The reason I like the WHk universe is that everyones a massive dick in it there are no good guys and bad guys. The Chaos Marines at least are honest. You dont put superhuman beings in charge who have no fucking idea what being human means. If you look at them all the Astrates and Primarch are fundamentally retarded psychologically. They have no clue about the human condition they behave like a bunch of moronic teenagers with too much testosterone and too little brains. You wont go far if these are the ones leading your crusade. The name itself is telling. Very tellingly the whole honourbased way of life is a life of bloodshed and brutality just like it was in the age of knights in the Middle Ages. They literally have nothing to live for but to fight with people like this you get the SS the Mongol hordes in short people who murder and fight. And also very tellingly once they retreat into the Eye they turn upon each other like a bunch of shithead gangbangers instead of sitting down and thinking things over like adults do.And then the way he treats his individual sons... As if he was absolutely clueless about how to interact with humans. The best example? Angron  he should just been left to die or at least the emperor should have saved his buddies. Also should not have made friends with his slavers. Angron has a very good point about him being just one of those slavers he despises the whole Imperium is built on exploitation suppression and genocide. Lets not mention the whole Nails story who the hell waits for a hundred years before saying stop that son. Dont do it to your soldiers? Who could not see how batshit crazy Konrad was the first second they met? How did it take a hundred years to censure someone who was a religious crusader even BEFORE you found him? Why not tell him about the gods of the warp and warn him about them?A very interesting aspect of this whole thing is that most fallen Astrates view this conflict as only a civil war and in a way they are more adult than their loyalist cousins. They made or were forced to make a choice its something loyalists never have to do. In this respect they did what any human adult is doing but never their own kind. They are immensely fascinating because they grew up in this process emotionally unlike the loyal Astrates. They follow Abaddon or not because they choose to do is they fight the war because it means something for them they fight for the Imperium they built. So yeah the emperor really screwed up this one. His grandchildren grew up and made a choice neither he or their fathers liked.By the way theres a very good point to be made about the whole Ruinous Powers thing. They are not evil inherently they seem to coexist with countless of cultures without causing them harm or better yet help them. DembinskyBowdens books are amazing when they deal with this issue. Talon of Horus especially. It seems like the emperor managed to whip up a perfect storm that made them a danger. Perhaps humanity got too strong perhaps they whole betrayal but a lot of things culminated in this issue. Its been made very clear in many books that thousands of civilizations live peacefully with these powers. Sometimes they are unseemly human sacrifice but thats not exactly an alien concept even from our own ancestors  thousand years ago right? After all even the Bible mentions human sacrifice offered to God. Even now people pray to god for their armies to win conflicts which obviously comes at the price of death and suffering. The Warp is the underlying truth of the universe and its made up by us. All the sentient beings souls thats the very material of the Warp. It can have evil and it can have benevolent effects but it is in the fabric of everything. ,Warhammer40k,cxmwx92,1,t5_2rr81

5873290,0,t3_3vnxsd,It definitely seems your list needs a bit of streamlining if you want to make it harder to deal with. The best ways to improve your list will depend on your personal play style so youll need to make the final decisions on that but Ill try to point out some problems with the way you built the list and that should give you an idea of how to improve.First Id like to address points efficiency. Since youre running a  point list you dont really have the luxury of taking everything you want for your army. When youre purchasing units for an army the biggest question should always be will I get my points worth out of this unit? There are a few ways you might accomplish this. The unit could be so durable it draws more than its fair share of firepower it could be so powerful it destroys more than its fair share of enemies or it could be so disruptive to your enemys plans that it scores more than its fair share of victory points. The problem with the way youve built your list is that most of your units will have a hard time accomplishing any of these. Lets look at some examples.CAPTAIN Probably wont be able to do more than his fair share of damage. Strength  power weapon attacks arent going to be able to down points heavy models so youre mostly looking at killing infantry. Best case scenario hes killing space marine equivalents which means he needs to kill about  models to break even on points before he dies. Thats not realistically gonna happen in most games. A  save is nice but theres too much that negates it in the game right now hes not really gonna be able to tank his points value back. Hes definitely not getting more than his share of VP as a single model with no extra maneuverability shenanigans.SCOUTS Sniper rifles will as a rule almost never get their points back by doing damage. Only half your hits in a game will even wound. At one shot apiece your scout squad would only cause around  saves a turn and if you take into account armor and cover theyre unlikely to do much at all. The camo cloaks are very useful though as they make scouts much harder to kill. To make scouts even more efficient take minimum squads with camo cloaks and park them in cover next to objectives. Your opponent will be forced to spend more points than its worth clearing them out allowing the rest of your army to face less resistance.TERMINATORS Terminators are points inefficient. Sorry. The models look awesome and I love them dearly but they are never the cheapest tool for the job. Their low model count means that even if you give them all stormshields  your almost  point unit is still going to get crippled once it gets hit by a volley of small arms fire. That  save isnt enough without at least toughness  or feel no pain or some sort of armor reroll. You will have a very hard time getting your points worth out of terminators.LANDRAIDER Also terribly points inefficient. You arent going to do enough damage with it to make up its points and theres enough dedicated antitank in the game that its unlikely to be able to resist a concerted effort to kill it. That being said the current meta contains a lot of lists that rely on mass strength  as their antitank. Against lists like this it could be very amusing.As a general note for points inefficiencies you dont want to have too many expensive units around  points or more in a  list. It limits your armys options too much and becomes too easy for your opponent to predict. You can afford to have one maybe two but they really need to be able to pull their weight to be worth it. If youre taking units that are that expensive they should be forcing your opponent to build their entire strategy around dealing with those units in a  point game.In terms of transports you might consider replacing your rhino and razorback with drop pods. Drop pods put way more pressure on your opponent and open up quite a few tactical options. Also rhinos and razorbacks give your opponent an easy option for scoring first blood so thatll generally put you at a  VP deficit in every game you play.Some final thoughts on your tactics as youve outlined them If you want an HQ to support your assault terminators a Chaplain would be better his special rules add more synergy. Spending almost  points on a terminatorHQLand Raider combo is too much for taking down weak units or support units. Thats more than a third of your points. That many points should be able to smash the core of your enemys army apart.The tactical squad does not have enough firepower to be dedicated antitank. Two guns is simply not enough when most tanks have three hull points. Dont rely on rolling an explodes result. It just wont happen as often as you like. Dont rely on scouts to pin things down. A good chunk of armies in the game are immune to pinning and the rest are unlikely to fail a leadership test without significant leadership debuffswhich you do not have.The centurions would be much scarier with gravguns and an amplifier.

That seems more like Killteam where Nobz are just another thing to point your megadeath meltagun at rather than Battlefleet Gothic where taking down a capital ship required committing your whole fleet and several game turns to the attack. Maybe the videos are edited so we only see the killing blow at the end of a long attack there are just too many killing blows and it raises eyebrows.As an aside Id say Homeworld actually did d RTS better than Sins of a Solar Empire.

I dont know if it is practical at a more public level but it works for private games inside groups to prevent some of the problems that a arms race can bring to a group.  It used to be that Table Top Standard was three colours and a wash. So if you were doing Ultramarines then Blue with a wash and then a dry brush with two other primary colours on there.

6044153,0,t3_3y9qzo,There has been talk of this but the rumors seem to be coelessing around a pretty solid theory. AoS is going to be the introductory game. Good idea as there is tie ins to DnD and other fantasy systems. K is going to be their intermediate product. Aimed at a slightly younger crowd with more advanced rules but still lots of themes and ideas that will appeal to younger and newer players. Finally HH will be their Advanced game for the older players and players who are more experienced and want a game with more depth and complexity.  From what I understand the BoC box is the first box and introduces a new line of plastic. There should be another box set incoming that will introduce the other half of the model range. There is also a predator or something set to be released I believe. HH will take up the shelf space that LoTR used to have.  Those are the rumors that I have heard to date. Of course it is all rumors and I have no more special information than anyone else with an internet connection.  Anyhow I dont think they are going to AoS K anytime soon.

They come in together T or T elite orbital strike themed list and get to put multiple hits on one or two of the opponents units. The ability to reroll wounds and hurt cover reliant units is extremely helpful. When making use of them in non salamanders arimes similar tricks with melta or plasma tends to make them most useful. Another option is small squads with the plasma cannons sitting in the back field. Lascannons typically seem a poor choice to me lacking the punch of mobile melta or the infantry threat of plasma cannons.Grav is fun but typically plasma weapons are more useful in a tactical squads which need mobility or range to be most useful.I do not feel it is worth expanding them to  man squads where the tax for gain work out worse with each model added.Killing them is a matter of massed fire or one specialised hit but marines are marines and everyone knows them.

All being Nurgle Daemons they all get  cover saves and  invulnerables plus defensive grenades denying enemy chargers their bonus attacks for charging. The army also has fear across the board which may severely gimp non ATSKNF and Fearless armies. The Defensive grenades can be thrown as Blind grenades to soften targets for assault. And in case were not familiar with the Nurgle formation special rules leak this whole army gets immunity to Overwatch. Also all units within  of the Herald get Feel No Pain. Finally any enemy units in close combat with any Nurgle units from this formation have to do a Leadership test each assault fight sub phase. On failing they get  Toughness and  Strength for that round. I think immunity from Overwatch is a great boon for charging for obvious reasons but coupled with defensive grenades which severely weakens enemy cc means that Plaguebearers in these formations are extremely solid regardless of whether they are charging or getting charged.

6511512,0,t3_44tbir,The one caveat Id add about playing Chaos is that a lot of what you get in Dark Vengeance will require some modifications to really function for you.The Lord is weirdly equipped once you get the hang of the game and Chaos in general youll probably end up kitbashing a lord on a demonic steed or a bike and the Chosen will stay useful in your collection only if youre willing to do some cutting and converting so they carry plasma or melta guns if you do the conversion for them give them all the same special weapon instead of a bunch of melee stuff its not difficult conversion work that said. The cultists are solid and if youre going to use helbrutes at all a fistmelta setup is what youll probably want anyway. Also if you like chaos and want to win games by charging across the board and punching everything to death take a look at Khorne Demonkin they use a combination of CSM and Demons to win the game in assault. Theres a very nice start collecting Khorne Demons box thatd be a good place to start with them. They can use everything in the DV set as well although like I said if you go that route youll definitely want to look at building a juggernaught chaos lord or three.Dont buy GWs overpriced line of brushes or files or tools theyre no better than much cheaper options you can get literally anywhere else.

6587191,0,t3_45wpsc,Plague Marines are one of the strongest choices in the CSM codex and are definitely my favorite cult troop.  They are an Elites choice unless you have a Chaos Lord with the Mark of Nurgle in your primary detachment in which case they become troops.  This is where they shine because they are already obnoxious to kill for most opponentsand then giving them objective secured makes them awesome. Id suggest reading up on the rulebook since much has changed in th with army structure and allies.My ideal loadout for Plague Marines is  in a rhino with  meltaguns.  Others prefer plasma you may want to play with both to see what you like better.Since youll need a Chaos Lord with Mark of Nurgle to make it work one of the best ways to run him is to give him a Bike Power Fist Lightning Claw Blight Grenades and Sigil of Corruption.  If you use the Crimson Slaughter supplement then you can give him relic armor called the Daemonheart  for a  save and It Will Not Die.  Comes in around  points.  Then for a bodyguard you can stick him with  Spawn with the Mark of Nurgle so you have a unit with a total of x Toughness  Wounds.Paint wise Nurgles Rot is great.  Its a greenish slime perfect for wounds gun barrels backpack vents etc.  Id also recommend picking up Typhus Corrosion and Ryza Rust.  Typhus Corrosion is a dark brown wash that is textured to give the effect of pitted metal.

6653708,0,t3_46rh9d,I have the Urban Combat mat from FLG and Ill echo SmashFuckers comments. its great. I  agree exactly what he said so rinserepeat his post. I would only add that I sometimes find it a little ... busy ... what with all the different colors on it. I also have the ... uh ... the snow mat from gamemat.eu. Just got it last week used it for the first time. I see no difference in build quality. I found the colors are just a bit more muted and I liked that. Theres not as much going on color wise so when models and terrain hit the board it seems more appropriate. When I compare it to the picture like I said the colors dont seem as vibrant in person. And thats a plus for me. Its not cartoony. It doesnt have the premapped deployment zones so be aware of that. That said it also came out a lot cheaper for me in Canada so that was a big selling point for me. So my points are  You cant go wrong with either company.  Both FLG and gamemat are great quality.  FLG is more warhammer friendly. The deployment zone thing cant be understated.  gamemat came in quick and with shipping was cheaper. ,Warhammer40k,d07juiy,3,t5_2rr81

About your list someone else can correct me here but I thought you couldnt use an allied detachment and a combined arms detachment from the same book.  Ill double check the rule book on that.    Lastly the list you provided could all fit into one Combined Arms Detachment since you have plenty of HQ troops fast and heavy slots to fit all those units into.  Although I highly recommend taking an aspect host formation whenever you can.

7022470,0,t3_4bsr3v,The formulation for regular artists acrylics is way different to model paints. Im a brokeass college graduate and Ive tried using my old acrylics before... it wasnt exactly the greatest. You could probably pull it off with patience and maybe some combination of mediums but the main problem is that they dont go on opaque enough and thin enough at the same time so their coverage is crap and youre going to lose details just by getting a clean coat from how much you have to put on.So I stick with model paints now. Try your local hobby shops and look for stuff like Vallejo you can often get stuff for pretty cheap that way though not always exactly what you want bright colors might be hard to find. I can get a lot of basic albeit mostly dull vallejo colors at my hobby lobby for  each the little ml tubes which are plenty honestly.,Warhammer40k,d1ccjvl,1,t5_2rr81

7051956,0,t3_4c73sn,FW Experimental rules are always over the top. They make new units pretty powerful and then nerf them before putting them in a book only to nerf them a bit more an edition or two further down the line. Most FW units are bowled right up the middle and their army lists are the epitome of midtier. There are a handful of units spread throughout the books that are just hands down better than anything else in its class but usually only breaks if you spam it. The FW writers big deal right now is adding limitations to an army for flavor. Usually this means FW armies themselves wont place at a tournament as they break down easily against a real hardasnails list. The upside is that they balance it out with fun rules that change the nature of whatever army theyre augmenting whether it be deep striking AM assault heavy AM Chaos AM Jetpack Eldar selfhating Necrons or Marines that are REALLY REALLY REALLY good at one very specific thing. For players who play a lot or get bored with netlists FW offers a lot of opportunity to get back to the fun of k.Its nothing to worry about but if a unit ever makes the game stop being fun isolate that and either try to tone it down or ask them not to play it anymore.,Warhammer40k,d1fp4n6,1,t5_2rr81

7072543,0,t3_4cfhhh,Is the  points the limit set by the GW Shop?In addition to this according to the GW kill team rules you have to purchase whole squads so you need all ten veterans. You cant just leave two behind and knock the equivalent points off. You may want to get in contact with the shop youre playing at to check if that would be okay. So supposing that you are allowed to just take the eight veteransOption You could keep Grenadiers Doctrine but get rid of the plasma and grenade launcher and take two meltas this will quickly sort out any vehicles or TEQs making their way towards you. The Sarge should take a boltgun instead of a bolt pistol. You shouldnt be in melee so the extra kick and range of the boltgun should serve you a bit better. Option Everyones elses weapons will most likely be able to get through your armour even with the  on the armour save afforded by carapace armour. Why not swap it out for forward sentries which costs  points less gives you a  cover save even on open ground and gives you snare mines in case you get assaulted.Meltas and boltgun again. This will give you  spare points you could use to purchase either a flamer or a grenade launcher.However if the shop rules that you need the full squadScrap the ChimeraTwo Veteran SquadsOne with two meltas the other has a flamer two snipers and a boltgun.  points for the squads x for the meltas  for the flamer x for the snipers and  for the boltgunRemember the squads dont need to move in cohesion also youll have more models than most other people which will be useful when you need to make break tests. ,Warhammer40k,d1i1b05,1,t5_2rr81

7073520,0,t1_d1i4uhj,Id agree but the extra psyker just outweighs it for me.  Zoanthropes are only  points each and thats an extra shot from blast which can really do some work.Same with the Tervigon she rules in low points.  Freely summoned termagaunts can really help and she is a level  psyker.  Shes also an MC so if she does get to CC with anything at  she can probably kill it.  Shes also pretty tough and a .  If she rolls catalyst she can make your term squad quite tough and if taken as a troop she is objsec.  Also also she gives terms near her counterstrike which can help against melee oriented armies by just throwing dice.I understand your combining Prime with a hormagaunt brood for extra wounds but its not exactly hard to kill off hormagaunts no matter the size.  If they have any pie plates in their entire army then your death ball is in some serious trouble.I personally havent had any luck with primes and dont really see what they would accomplish beyond giving synapse when there are usually better options like the zoanthropes and malenthrope.,Warhammer40k,d1i5ap4,1,t5_2rr81

Unrelatedly he also displays my biggest gaming pet peeve complaining about luckdice when rolls do not go your way even when they are completely statistical for instance he will grumble and complain about taking  marine armor saves and failing one or a  save character saving  wounds in a row for his opponent.There are a good number of people who do play the game at a tiptop competitive level with every advantage taken to win.

7454868,0,t1_d2piagm,That is a very unoptimized list. In order for this to be a fair fight he will either have to bring his list up or you will have to bring your list down. For improving his list I have a couple of suggestions.. Look at the formations that the Blood Angels have access to. There are only about  that are worthwhile but they are pretty good. They are the Angels Wrath Intervention Force this is a far better way to run his Assault squads if he wants to keep them the Angels Fury Spearhead Force and the Archangels Sanguine Wing.. Look into running more Psykers. Psykers are one of the few things that Tau have no answer to. Plus the new space marine disciplines are amazing. He may even want to ally in a Librarius Conclave.. The drop pod dread should either be Cassor the Damned to take up a troop slot or a Furioso with Frag Cannon.. Either trade out the Assault squad for Death Company or split them into two squads and give them melta guns and drop pods. Assault Marines are very lackluster.. If you are cool with it let him use the Land Raider as a counts as Spartan Assault Tank. As for the terminators they arent terrible. Just overpriced.. Cut down on the number of tac Marines. Stick with  man squads and use lazplas razorbacks for the  squads you need.. Consider a vindicator or . Fast vindicators are no joke.. Consider some forgeworld stuff. Quad mortars Lazer Vindicator Destroyer Sicaran Battle Tanks Deredeo Dreadnaughts and Spartan Assault Tanks are all things that would work well against Tau.,Warhammer40k,d2pkkn3,2,t5_2rr81

A You can choose not to fire Overwatch against units that declare a charge against your unit but you must do so as each charge is declared  you cant wait until all charges are declared before deciding which units to fire Overwatch against. Obviously if youre successfully charged by one of your opponents units you cant fire Overwatch against subsequent chargers as youre locked in combat.To clarify this  Unit A charges you choose not to overwatch.  Unit A fails charge.  Unit B Charges you choose to overwatch.  Unit B fails charge.  Unit C Charges no overwatch.Unit A Charges.  You choose not to overwatch.  Unit A succeeds charge.

7689181,0,t3_4kiqui,The tau get started is very solid. My main advice is really carefully think through how you loadout your crisis suits.Youve got good antiinfantry with your fire warriors. Not factoring in the crisis and drones yet youre missing among other things a source of marker lights a source of antiTEQ antilight armour and antiheavy armour. All of these gaps need to be filled but making your crisis suits do all of them isnt a good choice.I would consider making one crisis into a commander with a drone controller and several marker light drones. Then either kitting out  suits for light AV hunting with missiles or plasmafusion combo to make them antiTEQ that could serve as antiAV in a pinch.Your next buy could fill the gap the crisis suits leave e.g. a broadside for missiles a hammerhead for taking out tanks a riptide or even a bunch of fire warriors for antiTEQ That would go a fair way in filling some gaps in your army for now. ,Warhammer40k,d3g7lmw,1,t5_2rr81

7759254,0,t3_4lj00q,Obligatory thin your paints. Even with water stuff is gonna take a couple coats if you want it thin enough to keep detail. As a space wolves player myself the little details are what set us apart from the vanilla chapters. You want all the wolfy stuff you can get. That said your brush control isnt too bad. Work on keeping in the lines on those pauldrons. Remember you can always touch it up to get cleaner lines as long as your paint is thin enough. My recommendation for faces do a base color a wash a highlight then leave it till youre a lot more experienced. Eyes will almost never look good because of the scale of the minis and it actually looks pretty good with just the darkish sunken recesses. All this is in my opinion though. Its really up to you feel free to just ignore all that and do what you want. ,Warhammer40k,d3o61it,1,t5_2rr81

Forces B and C were deployed  from opposing long table edges.The objective was thisForce A has a VIP in a transport.  We used a spare land raider for this.  He can be the ONLY one in the transport.  Force A can disembark the VIP but VIP moves like The Relic a character has to be in base contact and then VIP will follow that character.  The goal of Force A is to safely have VIP walk off the table on the opposite short table edge from where you start.Forces B and C are looking to kidnap the VIP and smuggle them across their long table edge where they deployed.Force A has the most points Im blanking on how many like  maybeForces B and C take diminished points like  or maybe ?This scenario is simple but ended up being insanely close with literally just  models left on the table on the final turn VIP Space Marine HQ and a Tau tank and just one more move would have seen the VIP escape.,Warhammer40k,d4d2uyq,2,t5_2rr81

8052190,0,t3_4phosy,I run a Tetrad Ive had mixed results.  When it works its amazing but it is very susceptible to the dice gods.  If you get good reward reroll invuln saves FNP  ArmourbaneFleshbane and good powers invis shrouding iron arm cursed earth then it can be really powerful.  But it isnt reliable unfortunately and just a few bad saving rolls and youre done.That said it can be a lot of fun but I hadnt even considered pairing it with the Soul Grinders.  I think the issue is that you will not have the board presence to score objectives and against someone with a lot of antitank youll be in trouble.  Youre also not running a full Daemonic Incursion so youre not getting the benefits of the full Detachment which make it much stronger.  All of the bonuses from it really help a lot.I pair mine up with a Tallyband and Daemon Flock  unit of Furies.  This gives me all of the bonuses and a lot of units to score with.  The other way people play it with some success is to run the Tetrad and then a Daemons CAD with Belakor and Pink Horrors.  Belakor adds a lot with guaranteed shrouding and invis as well as being a badass Pink Horrors give you more Warp Charges which is important to keep your guys buffed up.If you keep your current list or at least the Tetrad Id dump Corruption on Nurgle and get Mastery Level  on Slaanesh.  You need as many powers and dice as possible.  The Balesword is good enough and is arguably better than Corruption.  Soulstealer on Slaanesh is pretty sweet though.  Youll also want to get x Greaters on EVERYONE for survivability.  A Lesser Reward for Tzeentch is also good because it gets you the  Strength Staff making you S so you can actually take out vehicles pretty easily.My ideal Tetrad is something likeInfernal Tetrad  Points DP of Tzeentch  WARLORD Wings ML x Greater x Lesser Impossible Robes DP of Nurgle  ML Wings Armour x Greater DP of Slaanesh  ML Wings Armour x Greater DP of Khorne  Wings Armour of Scorn x Greater x Lesser,Warhammer40k,d4l544d,1,t5_2rr81

Look at it this way if youre a chaos player playing only with the vanilla codex vs a tau or eldar player yeah youre probably gonna get the shit kicked out of you assuming each player is really playing for the win. If youre not playing in a vacuum and you have access to allies and supplements then its a much different story. You cant really offer the argument of vanilla codex because  most of whats really good right now relies a lot on taking multiple armies to give your sold star this or that or to give your battle company this or that not to mention the calexus. people saying csm dont have good cheeses are uninformed in my opinion. Cyclopia cabal is crazy good spawn stars are still a thing invisibility is pretty accessible and so is fateweavergrimoir. Juggerlord plus axe is still a sick good unit. You also have Knights.

At least this is how it works with the dark Angels three different command squads.The command squad essentially needs to function as its described on the box. An honour guard for an elite member of the command structure. Any HQ can work well with them use them to add to their power. A command squad with commander can be a very effective at being a delaying tool for a melee threat or be a melee and short ranged threat by themselves. You want them to be in a position to pounce on targets of serious aggression and slow them up or eliminate them making the enemy take as long as possible to kill them and they will be a menace or can often seal the game up for you.,Warhammer40k,d5g3eko,2,t5_2rr81

8467749,0,t3_4vnyjw,Raven Guard are not what I would immediately describe as a melee powerhouse. Their special rules are very much focused on hit and run mobility and reserve control. You have a multitude of units that let you dictate where how and when your reserves can arrive. There are formations with special rules that enable you to leave the battlefield on demand and reenter reserves. You have plenty of stealth and cover related special rules to go around as well.However they do have plenty of decent assault options.If you want to start a Raven Guard army I strongly recommend acquiring a th Edition Space Marine Codex AND the Angels of Death Supplement. The Codex contains weapon profiles and unit profiles. The supplement contains special force organisation charts for the Raven Guard Imperial Fists Iron Hands White Scars and Salamanders. It also contains full datasheets for many formations that were previously only available in spread out supplements like the Raven Guard and White Scars supplement and collates them into a single book. It also includes a rack of new psychic powers. Angels of Death is by far the most uptodate and comprehensive resource for Space Marine force organisation and formations and gives you a huge number of options.If you want to build Raven Guard specifically then Angels of Death gives you the Talon Strike Force. This is a Strike Force like the Gladius Strike Force in the main book which is a force organisation chart composed solely of formations but gives you fluffy relevant special rules.The Talon Strike Force requires a minimum of  Core choice and you can take  Command choices and an unlimited number of Auxiliary choices.The special rules for this Strike Force allow you to reroll things like mission deployment who deploys first and mission type. You can also roll for reserves on turn  instead of turn  as normal. You can also choose to fail morale checks anytime. If you take Raven Guard Chapter Tactics AND the Talon Strike Force then you get all the Talon Strike Force special rules above ANDShrouded for all nonvehicle models that are not in a transport for the first turn adding  to the chance of Night Fighting. Your jump pack units can use jump packs in the movement AND assault phases and can reroll to wound on their Hammer of Wrath. If you look at their Chapter Tactics and Talon Strike Force special rules youll probably notice that they are NOT really a melee powerhouse. Their rules strongly emphasise hit and run stealth flanking and mobility  which can help with melee but thats not the core point.If you use the Talon Strike Force you must take either a standard Battle DemiCompany OR a Pinion Battle DemiCompany. The Pinion Battle DemiCompany is a bit different in that it emphasises Scout Marines and reserve control. Scout Marines in it can give another unit Ignores Cover against an enemy awesome. You can also have scouts lead another unit out of reserve at will no rolling and on the turn they arrive and they can let the unit Outflank out of reserves. And if the unit being led stays close to the scouts it gets Stealth for one turn. Take note again  reserve control not melee.The Battle DemiCompany and Pinion DemiCompany are already both really good in their own ways depending on your playstyle. The Pinion is focused on repositioning and scout support. The Battle DemiCompany is all about conventional warfare.You can get some strong melee options too.The Shadowstrike Kill Team formation contains Vanguard Veterans and Scout Squads. You can choose to let the Vanguard Veterans arrive on any turn rather than rolling for reserves. They can also charge on the turn they arrive from deep strike and dont scatter if theyre close to  scout squads from the formation. So this is where you can get some real melee damage but note again  it still emphasises reserve control and flanking you need to position the scouts well if you want them to not scatter on deep strikeTheres also the Bladewing Assault Brotherhood which consists of Vanguard Veterans an HQ and Assault Squads. This formation doesnt get to assault out of deep strike but it can disengage from the battlefield into reserves in the movement phase at will. It also uses special deep striking rules that allow them to re roll scatter and arrive as a single unit from reserve.Those are the dedicated melee formations you have access to. You also have access to things like the Raptor Wing  Stormtalons guaranteed to arrive on turn  from reserve Ravenhawk Assault Group A Stormraven with Sternguard and Dreadnought in it. Stormraven can deep strike but must hover. Can target an enemy and get rerolls to hit for formationI have to keep emphasising that the Raven Guard are a fantastic army but their special rules arent about overpowering the enemy in melee. Rather theyre all about mobility consistent deep striking and reserves stealth and flanking. They fight maneuver warfare. And it just so happens that things like controlling reserves mobility and flanking ties in very well with assault armies. Its actually an advantage that theyre not directly assault focused because you are never tied down to an assault playstyle. You can still play stealthy faster maneuver warfare without the assault but you always have the option for assault.If that tickles your fancy then you should get the Codex and Angels of Death. Get BattleScribe and start building lists. From then on you can decide what models to buy based on your formation and army requirements.Also remember that you can take formations on their own and still be Battle Forged. You can ignore the Talon Strike Force or ignore the Combined Arms Detachment completely and simply bring any collection of formations you want and still have a Battle Forged army. You will of course lose out on special rules the strike forces give you but this gives you more options. You could for instance bring an army of nothing but Shadowstrike Kill Teams and maybe some scouts to hide on turn one. Then the next turn dozens of Vanguard Veterans just fall from the sky and claw the enemy to death. Thats a completely fine way to play if monotonousThe point being that if the playstyle of Raven Guard which is NOT specifically melee oriented but instead flexible and mobile tickles you get Angels of Death and a Codex and start experimenting. And read both. You might find something else you like in there.Blood Angels are also an option but they got nerfed and if you want to be melee effective youre practically forced to take Death Company which costs a LOT of points. If you take Blood Angels you might end up with more melee firepower but no flexibility and a lack of mobility.,Warhammer40k,d6009tj,7,t5_2rr81

8482753,0,t1_d619vso,I know that a lot of this is constrained by the models you have DV is unfortunately an awkward way to start CSM because so much of what you get is weirdly equipped and suboptimal. as you learn the army youll understand what I meanIf youre running the Kranon model as your lord Id avoid overspending on him. The murder sword is a waste of points Id just take a power sword instead. Youre stuck with the plasma pistol even though its bad. I wouldnt take anything else to be honest or just a mark of nurgle if you want plague marines as troops.Eventually youll want to look at converting up a biker lord nurgle biker lords are pretty legit.Sorceror doesnt need a chainaxe hes already got a force weapon. Also get him a spell familiar. Id give him an invulnerable save. This guy will be your warlord most of the time sorcerors are the most flexible and widely useful CSM HQ.The best way to run chosen is with a ton of special weapons usually melta or flamers you can also do plasma but chosen want guns they can assault after firing theyre good in a fight. Again the DV chosen are kinda unfortunately laid out here a bunch of footslogging chosen with randomly selected power weapons arent going to pull their weight most of the time. So something to work towards. Special weapons on your bikers! Melta or plasma. CSM need specials too either two of the same special weapon or if theyre going to be hanging back and shooting Id take plasmaautocannon on them. Hellbrutes should be cheap and cheerful the basic multimelta power fist setup should work just fine. Hes not all that durable dont overspend on him.,Warhammer40k,d61w0g5,3,t5_2rr81

8563652,0,t1_d6bx53t,Units with different movement profiles like bikes and jumppacks move as per their movement rules even if they are in a mixed unit the only restriction is they have to end the turn in coherency.  If you have your unit spread out to minimize hits from blasts it takes more than  of movement for a vanguard with a storm shield or a bike with that beautiful  jink to get to the side facing the ap weaponry in order to tank it.  The movement speed isnt lost.  In addition you can use the bikes and jump backs in the same unit to snake your unit a bit to get that extra few inches in the movement phase to do a proper charge since they are still able to move more than .  And on top of that as long as there are jump pack models in the unit that didnt move more than  you get the reroll for the charge distance for the ENTIRE UNIT.  This is ALL derived from the draft FAQs that were put out by GW not rules lawyer interpretations.So your unit is footslogging say with a bike and a storm shield vanguard vet orbiting around the unit to try to absorb high ap shots.  Youve got an enemy unit that needs to get charged.  Your unit moves up for the kill the jump pack guy moves only six you shift your bike to get up front and shave an extra  inches off the charge distance you otherwise wouldnt have thanks to the movement and base size of the bike.  then on top of that you get to reroll the distance for the charge basically eliminating any chance of flubbing it.

I said that Psykana division is worth using in tournamentsSpecifically it only appears to be useful in ETC. gt backed it up by showing that it is used in the ETC tournamentThree of the five examples you gave would be illegal to use in the ITC format. Thus the actual application and usefulness of such a formation is put into question if OP happens to play in the US. gt then youre saying that Im wrong that its a tournament list because its not in your particular tournament scene?No man the point I was making is that theres a reason why you dont see these formations that do that specific thing in major tournaments here. I dug deeper and found out why. ETC has more lax rules but ETC is also a completely different format. Your post is arguably much worse than mine because you dont offer ANY drawbacks to the list. Instead saying its a tried and true tournament competitive list EXCEPT where it isnt and when thats pointed out you double down. gt We could also do without resorting to the personal attacks mate.Little late for all of that now I believe since you went ahead and said I was to be disregarded and then proceeded to basically give OP extremely bad advice if not worse advice than what I gave.

8689705,0,t3_4z0dbx,Those posts you found are great and wont steer you wrong. Ive had a few airbrushes now so this is all my personal recommendations. I use airbrush for basecoating some shading and highlighting mainly on vehicles but some zenithal on troops then go in with the brush for details and finishing off.My decent airbrush I use is an Iwata TR Revolution it has a trigger grip for the dual action control which is pretty useful for getting to grips with it and the side cup doesnt get in the way. Its not a cheap brush by any stretch but its rock solid quality very little overspray and even though its a .mm nozzle I can get pretty fine lines with it and its more than adequate to do some work on individual power armour sections for example.Think you can get some Iwata brushes closer to what youre looking to spend too.Ive recently picked up a cheap  dual action airbrush with a .mm nozzle from China on aliexpress. I initially wanted it just to use to spray quick and dirty jobs basecoats or more solvent based stuff so I wasnt really after great detail. But the build quality massively surprised me and it sprays pretty well from some quick tests. Little bit of overspray but its going to become my main basecoatingpriming workhorse.And remember to get a moisture trap of humidity is an issue where you are.,Warhammer40k,d6ruac3,2,t5_2rr81

8711411,0,t3_4zaybl,In the grim darkness of the far future there can only be virtue signalling!But really we have had female farseers leading the Eldar in the excellent Dawn of War games strong female guard leaders in Space Marine and in game models like Shadowsun and Lelith Hesperax.Not to mention a whole army of girls Sisters of Battle.The fluff is also replete with women in power across the Imperium and Mechanicum.  But no lets obsess that there are no female space marines.  Lets ignore the fact that historically war is carried out by men due to mens average greater strength and that war games appeal to men more then women on average.  Lets ignore the fact that the population of women gamers is far lower then male gamers and that is just a function of women on average liking something different from men.  Why does equality mean that women have to be carbon copies of men?  Why does equality mean that there is only one set of acceptable behaviors no matter what your gender is?  Why when there isnt a perfect  mix does that mean something is wrong?The truth is men and women are different.  There are broad populations and there is obviously some overlap but it is counterproductive to force everything into a  mix.  You can see this in all the title IX enforcement where colleges are throwing money at women sports in a vain attempt to get them to approach anything like the male attendance rates and failing miserably.  Meanwhile mens intramural sports continue despite having all their funds taken away.  TLDR  Men and Women are different and that is ok. ,Warhammer40k,d6uk9m7,6,t5_2rr81

8765418,0,t3_505pqs,Depends on what you mean by on the tabletop.You could definitely say that guard fight like modern militaries and so a lot of their issues mirror those modern armies would have against k armies. In the modern world taking cover means a group of infantry is pinned down while in k many armies can bring cover with them and continue advancing so guard lack ignores cover which is a big problem .Also guard are relatively well equipped to handle vehicles where a single penetrating hit will destroy or disable it but against monstrous creatures who need to be completely killed to be removed guard struggle bringing enough heavy firepower to bear.In a meta sense those are two big factors that hurt guard so like tyranids guard need to rely on skew lists to win. That means they need to load up on one type of unit like tanks or infantry and make their opponent hopefully waste about half of their weapons.Luckily these problems dont apply as much to casual games and combined arms guard will work ok but if youre going to a tournament Id stick to all tanks or all infantryartillery.,Warhammer40k,d71c8en,8,t5_2rr81

In kind of an awkward place right now game wise.Orks An army built around large numbers of cheap but pretty poor troops. Its all about weight of fire and getting into close combat. Also wacky random antics.Eldar An army built around mobility and truly withering amounts of firepower at both long and short ranges.Dark Eldar In principle like the Eldar but more mobile and harder hitting in exchange for being more fragile. In practice? Neither more mobile nor harder hitting still more fragile.Harlequins Like the Dark Eldar but even more fragile. Nightmares in close combat but good luck getting there.Assassins Not really an army as much as supersoldiers to add to an Imperial faction.Necrons Its all about durability. Your troops just dont die. Also you get some really cool death rays.Khorne Demonkin All About Close Combat. Rewards for killing things. Rewards for dying. Inquisition Not really an army as much as flavorful characters to add to an Imperial faction.Imperial Knights Big big robots. Low model count army with good representation in both melee and ranged. Will have trouble holding objectives. A single Knight makes an excellent ally.Chaos Space Marines In principle a faction of pretty elite fighters with a slight emphasis toward close combat but lots of theme and flavor plus cheap expendable cultists. In practice like the Space Marines but worse and more expensive. Brought mainly for the cultists.Chaos Demons Hugely flexible book can do all kinds of things. Its nastiest trick is summoning more demons. Potentially lots more demons.Astra Militarum The Imperial Guard. Lots of cheap troops with volume of fire backed by heavy tanks and artillery.Adeptus Mechanicus Merging two armies here because really theyre one army in spirit. Good mid and shortranged shooting melee is somewhat disappointing but thats what Knights are for. Deathwatch New kids on the block. Ultraelite units probably best as allies for an Imperial army.Grey Knights We fight demons. Ultraelite units of really badass dudes but liable to get overwhelmed.

They have neat tricks but are tricky to play.Space Marines In all their forms some variant of semielite troops that can cover multiple roles but dont particularly excel at any one of them. Pretty much the standard army so its never super bad and always supported.Space Wolves Like Space Marines but with more wolf icons all the wolf icons.... Greater emphasis on close combat can take a charge. Have a superpowerful unique cavalry unit Thunderwolves.Blood Angels Like Space Marines but with more blood drops.

Which means all of your minimal sized squads will get free razorbacks and your dreads will get free drop pods for max hilarity.If you have a chaplain and a captain youre already  of the way there.Regarding the jink yes theyll be snapfiring. But heres the great bit. If you run a Ravenwing strike force the turn they arrive they can jink and fire at full bs the subsequent turn. Also even after that I have two words for you black knights. Jink and turbo all the way across the table and smash into your opponents with those corvus hammers. Run a chaplain on a bike in that command squad with the Ravenwing banner and the entire squad will get Hatred and autopass hit and run which means youll have  rending corvus hammers rerolling their hits on first round of combat on top of the chaplain face smashing everything with his crozius and power fist and thrn after your opponents assault phase if their entire unit is not already dead autopass hit and run and move d and repeat by smashing into another unit rerolling hits because of hatred on first combat.Its a really troll strategy for tying down units or just destroying them altogether. Amazing at higher point games immensely fun but arguably inefficient at lower points.If you want to have a decently competitive low points list double demi is the way to go. Free razorbacks andor drop pods are just too good.Laugh verily as you bring  points more worth of free stuff over your opponents and watch them cry because they dont have enough stuff in a k point list to deal with a bunch of razors plowing their lines.Edit Its called the Lions Blade Strike Force.

8990312,0,t3_53eqxt,I think that having a Helldrake Auxilliary is very important. Its still one of Chaos only fliers and it isnt as much of a point sink as most Storm Raven formations for CSM. The Terminator formation might be the only feasible method of fielding Chaos terminators in th. Period. Its the best Terminator based formation available to the faction. The most important aspect is the RaptorWarp Talon formation. If you go with Str  Lightning Claw spam or tactical Melta Raptors youre making the most this formations special rules. I definitely think itll be an autoinclude in balanced CSM lists. Having a fresh selection of official psychic powers is really important for the faction right now. The CSM faction has long flaunted a bevy of psychic heavyweight characters and MCs so getting a new menu of good powers not Angels of Death good is very refreshing for players who own Chaos models. Getting the bits for a Chaos Sorcerer these days is quite easy what with all the recent Chaos kits floating around in box sets. ,Warhammer40k,d7shwmt,1,t5_2rr81

I was often really unhappy with how my minis were turning out because at every stage I was comparing them to the Eavy Metal dudes which is absurd considering that these are some of the best painted minis youll ever see.As far as apartment logistics  consider making a little spray booth in your shower. a box on its side propped up on a small stool should work just fine and as long as you spray with the curtain protecting the area outside the shower you should be fine. There will be some dusty black residue that is going to get all over the place but as long as you are proactive with cleaning it should come right off it did for me.

9174786,0,t3_55yswh,I am interested in playing it but weary that it will only be fun for a week or two like vermintide. Vermintides biggest falloff was the riskreward system for loot poor map layout and the party system not being backed up with capable AI. VT is not and will never be a game you can play on your own. The AI is terrible gutter runners will straight up ruin you. With a pick up group  times it is the same thing. The maps were very straight forward. As a player I had choices but not many. Sometimes a route would be different but it was never much different. Not enough to feel different. The choices in levels were bland resulting in very quickly saying wait there are no more levels?The riskreward loot system all loot is random. So this made the player base turn into a speed run group. Which ultimately ruined the game for me. Everyone wanted orange gear asap so they speed run. SHDW could be very enjoyable. Its a shooter that is pretty boss and already a step above VT. Melee was enjoyable but it wasnt very good melee. If VT had Witcher  style melee fighting? I wouldnt have ever stopped playing. If there is an upgrade system I just hope it isnt random. I hope that if it forces group play there is an AI option and it isnt bad. Mostly though if it turns out to be a LFD clone like VT was I hope the gutter runner mob isnt a fucking asshole. I am excited but weary. ,Warhammer40k,d8eyzkf,9,t5_2rr81

9198766,0,t3_56c0qf,When you buy a board game from Games Workshop the models in them are the same quality as their other miniatures. The Deathwatch models in Overkill are literally the exact same ones that you got in the Kill Team Cassius box. They just reboxed the sprues from Overkill into the Cassius box for resale. If you dont want duplicates you probably wouldnt want Overkill unless you are interested in the board game part or the Genestealer Cult models. That being said the Overkill game is fun on its own and the quality of the game boards and pieces is top notch. GW makes some of the best quality models out there so you cant really go wrong. GW has been using the boardgames to revitalize lesser selling models and to introduce new ones at a good bundle price while including rules for people who dont necessarily want to start playing full k at first. Its a great way to get new players IMO and has been doing well from what I understand.,Warhammer40k,d8i0f2a,2,t5_2rr81

As long as you pick your wargear support systems ranged weapons special gear from the lists which are allowerd everything is fine.So actually you can mix weapons and armor if some units an example for armor would be a crisis sqaud with a squad leader shasVRE who could take iridium armor giving him  armor while the rest of the squad has   but only the shasvre has access to it not the normal crisis,Warhammer40k,d8js93u,2,t5_2rr81

9262110,0,t1_d8q0y4f,The vulnerability comes from having your vulnerable parts emphasised because theyre the only part covered and the rest of the body isnt suggesting that those parts somehow need more protection. And the next feeling of fear is knowing full well that a metal thong will do nothing to actually protect you and is solely there as an accessory to emphasise a vulnerability. Thats one of the chief complaints with depictions that feature chainmail bikini thongs and the like.There a reason men dont regularly go out in public with only a sock on their dick and normally feel wrong if they were forced to do that. Covering your vulnerability in this case only emphasises it.,Warhammer40k,d8q1ewu,1,t5_2rr81

Not to mention the ad mech are suspected of worshipping a ctan as mentioned by op. But also your reason for one not existing is simply wrong. Many fictional cults that worship a legit greater being dont really realize what they are doing and foolishly believe they can tame the creature to bring them power. Then the being comes slaughters the cultists and everyone and everything it can until a hero heeds the call and saves the day. Or dies trying.     And while we are not mentioning things the very source in question summons a beast that destroys them and all other bio mass on their planet. The Emperordamn Hive Mind for Emperors sake!    So yes ctan cultists can and do exist and would operate similar to GSC rules in that they would work along side their Gods and then likely be destroyedconsumedabsorbed immediately after if they and their God are on the victorious side this brief encounter.,Warhammer40k,d8u2b0e,7,t5_2rr81

Every codex was sort of self contained  you had your units that you could buychoose from and that was that. Nowadays every codex seems to have a lot more units with more options. Back then your choices were fairly limited. I think this was cool in that you had to work with a pretty small selection of models.

9306917,0,t3_57xhw3,I usually bring out the Deathwing to be a bit fluffy or tone down my list.Using the Deathwing Strike Force and  or  Ravenwing Attack Squadrons also a RW strikeforce at higher point gameins to have multiple quick homers.Terminators havent been too great as such I bring a Termi Lib with the Foesmiter and a command squad with an apothecary cyclone missile launchers and maybe the DW banner. The second elite choice is a VenDread in a drop pod. Using a CAD instead of formation if you plan on deepstriking will be slow since you have to wait to bring them in. The Strikeforce decides what turn they come in Always turn two and I get my little termistar and the Melta Dread all up in my opponents army. DW knights are garbage from Deepstrike in my opinion. If you go CAD you will need some Land Raiders which are also not great and huge point sinks.My attack Squadrons can include either a MultiMelta attack bike or two with a Double MultiMelta Landspeeder or a squad of Grav Bikers and a Typhoon or double heavy bolter Landspeeder.You can even max out the regular bike squads in the Attack Squadrons so that you can combat squad them in to multiple units giving you a better spread for deepstrike.,Warhammer40k,d8vpw2g,1,t5_2rr81

9419922,0,t1_d99ywu2,As someone who does run a very infantryheavy guard I generally agree with him. Lets be perfectly honest the Guard sucks at MSU. Mechvets arent terrible but nobody was particularly impressed by them at any point. Tactical Marines in Drop Pods or Rhinos do everything they do better and more cheaply with better special rules. The Guard just cant compete using that playstyle.That said they do have good tools for grabbing objectives. Scion squads can deep strike on top of objectives safely thanks to Move Through Cover for a measly  points. Scout Sentinels with Heavy Flamers are fucking magical for harassing the backfield and taking points with a squad of  coming in at  points. Hellhounds and Banewolves are excellent at snatching midfield objectives. Your troop slot is not for that. Your troop slot is about presenting a huge distracting threat.  Guardsmen plus  Conscripts only runs you  points   . Add a pair of Commissars to that and for  points youve put  psudofearless wounds on the table. Using the Forwards for the Emperor! order you can put out enough shots from both squads to threaten MSU squads and still apply pressure by moving them up the field. If they reach an objective they can basically squat on it for the rest of the game and deny your opponent the ability to take it without committing a ton of firepower to it. Heavy Weapons Squads only cost  points for three autocannons. Sure theyll probably run the second they lose a model but who cares? They can destroy way more than  points worth of stuff if theyre left alone and if your enemy shoots them youre only out half a Leman Russ.  Autocannons will put the hurt on anything but a Land Raider especially if you give them Tank Hunter from a CCS.Im working on building up to running the full infantry company but if you know what youre doing and how to play the army it can be way more threatening than people give it credit for especially against the hyper optimized lists you see in a lot of games that are keyed towards killing other hyperelite armies. Meltaguns Grav Cannons Haywire and the like dont do shit to  conscripts and even if they did theyre still only killing  point models. The Imperial Guard will almost never kill a list like that but by god will they swarm the table capture objectives like madmen and endure an insane amount of shooting while doing so.,Warhammer40k,d9a1ggg,1,t5_2rr81

9471638,0,t3_5ahmk3,From what you have i would run something like this. Its not extremely strong but i think it would be a good experience for you to start out with a lot of different unit typesHQHive TyrantDual Devourers and wings. Including Electroshock GrubsElite x Hive Guard x Hive Guard x VenomthropesTroops x Hormagant Squad  x Ripper Swarms Deep Strike Spine Fists x Termagants for Tervigon Troop ChoiceTervigon Electroshock Grubs squads of  Warriors Adrenal Glands Deathspitters Rending clawsHeavy SupportCarnifex  x Devourer armsMawlocThis is a bit similar to one of my older sixth edition and earlier th edition lists.  It kind of abuses the cover save system with the venomthropes and layering of troop choices.  You kind of have a smattering of a lot of different units.  and it really depends on how competitive your local group is.  The warriors are a bit of a point sink but behind the termagants and beside the venomthropes they should generally always have a  cover save with  heavy bolter shots a turn and decent in assault with the rending claws.  I admit this isnt probably the best list you could run but it will teach you a lot about th edition tyranids.Oh side note. I personally like to run a mawloc over the trygon though it is much more random. it usually does more damage when it comes in and is still an MC.

In reality there is so much more bang for the buck in the codex point wise everywhere else.All that said realistically speaking if you dont rip them up turn  I can totally see them being good vs necrons. A squad of  with the  to weapon skill canticle on a charge would totally mulch the ever living shit out of a large portion of the Necron codex. But then again a group of  dragoons would do the same at less than half the point cost points vs . To be completely fair I almost never see necron armies where I play. Its mostly demonscsm sm orcs and tau.

The set you purchased is a introductory set and the minis are designed to be simple to build for people who are new to the hobby.Basically all other models in the GW range come separate from their bases and as such can be glued on top of other basing materials.

9585721,0,t3_5c8ok7,Well plan before you deploy. Solid plans and a backup plan. Assign each units tasks and then a backup in case that cant work. Do you plan on deepstriking some meltas to tank pop? What if they scatter or dont come in do you have other units that can deal with tanks? Do you have a squad assigned to take an objective? What if they get pinned or wiped out?In Maelstrom especially you gotta be flexible with changing objectives. Blob units can get cut down quickly so look at dedicated transports maybe? Chimeras or Valkyries?Look to be proactive. You can field lots of units as AM and be aggressive. Make your opponent react to you. One thing that helped me recently was avoiding their deathstar.

9796956,0,t1_dakivy9,Short answer as long as the Valkyrie is from the same book you are running the scions in they may start in it.Long AnswerDedicated transport just means that only the unit it is bought for and any Independant characters from the same faction may start in it. I.E. if your veteran squad bought a chimera your company command cant start the game in it but may embark during your turn one. As long as the valkyrie is from the same faction Astra Militarium if the scions are using that book or Militarium Tempestus if you are bringing them on their own then your scions can start the game in it regardless what detachment they are from i.E. if you have a hell rain formation and a cad or allied Militarium Tempestus detachment then the squads from Hell Rain can start in the valkyrie from the combined arms detachment or allied detachment.Personally I would buy Taourox Primes with missiles and augur array in general over valkyries. Rush the taurox up and then the scions deep strike in and dont scatter if near the taurox. Though with a large group of tau you have to be really carful since for crazy cheap almost every tau mecha suit can take interceptor allowing them to shoot at your guys that just came in on your movement phase they do forgo the shooting attacks in their next shooting phase but it is worth the price to be able to protect your line from deep striking flamers meltas and plasmas. also all the suite can take an upgrade also pretty cheap that lets them choose to have sky fire or not so the valkyrie coming in could just be shot down before it drops off your troops. ,Warhammer40k,dakopvx,1,t5_2rr81

As it stands it feels like my hotshot volley guns do all the killing but the lasguns are not reliable whatsoever. You need to get too close and when you are that close you typically get butchered.Makes no sense to me how someone who trains day in day out from the age of  is somehow just as squishy as an  year old guardsman whos had a rifle slapped in his hands and been told to run in that direction. IMO toughness displays how shaken around someone can get how much of a beating they can take. If I took at a ft tall SAS operator and a weedy  year old kid and gave them each the same beating Theoretically assuming no resistance I would think that the SAS fella would come out pretty well unscathed just because of the huge difference in his body composition.

If you want to know about the Horus Heresy there is a book series  but that is really really long.Realistically there is too much to learn you cant learn the complete history of everything because not only is the history on going with stuff like Fall of Cadia coming out soon but tons of stuff is just unanwsered and hidden in mystery.Its much easier to learn the basic history of how everytime became the way it is which isnt too hard and then look into things that interest you but otherwise youll be spending hours upon hours learning about this stuff...If you want I can attempt to crudely explain the creation of all races and the horus heresy and why the chaos gods exist and stuff,Warhammer40k,dbn401k,2,t5_2rr81

Since Psykers fight by opening their mind to the warp you never know when they might become possessed by a daemon or get corrupted by chaos so it is a bit of a failsafe. Honestly though if a Psyker goes rogue you will probably know immediately from him turning every loyalist around him to dust or turning into a massive daemon anyway.Actual reason Rowboat Girlyman has a blue fetish.Fun Fact Tech Marines paint their armor red to represent the red sands of Mars the largest and oldest Forgeworld. Mars is a holy place for all tech heads and because of this  paint schemes for Ad Mech and Skitarii are red in honour of Mars other colors such as Ryzas Orange or Agripinaas inverted colors are seen as backwards and borderline heretical by Forgeworlds at large.,Warhammer40k,dbvp1j8,1,t5_2rr81

Drybrushing is where you rub off as much paint as possible and flick the brush quickly across the model.If you want to make it look better base the model before you spray the Uniform Grey I use a layer of cheap surface filler then paint it when youre finished  I paint it Ps Bootstrap Leather Ink it Ps Brown Ink and then paint the edge black so it looks like mud Its a fairly easy scheme and ends up looking like thisIm using the MkIII marines from the Prospero set as my Veterans so they dont have the danger stripes but they look a bit like thisVary the width to taste   Hope any of this helps!

The slugs for rail guns are travelling so fast that the air following the round doesnt have enough time to go into the empty space behind the rounds path creating a vacuum. So a vacuum can be created but for it to have any meaningful effect the round would have to be huge but once again this would cause a huge pressure wave in front doing way more damage. ,Warhammer40k,dc15su6,3,t5_2rr81

Then applying that as a first coat. From there the paint seems to stick better. Idk the order you painted your colors but I think you did blue then white are the shoulder pads for example.

10460940,0,t3_5pt3fk,Ive recently come into a small amount of disposable income over the last year or so. Been slowly acquiring every model Ive always wanted. Wanted a Baneblade since they were released got one last year. At the age of  I bought a box of Kasrkin that I had to save up for a number of months for. They got stripped and re painted so many times but Ive always wanted more of them. I finally assembled a stormtrooper army of about  stormtrooper platoons last year out of scions and FW Cadian heads. When those Kasrkin came on sale at the end of last year I struck at the chance and bought two squads which have since sat in my cupboard but its nice to have them. Two or three of the troopers in that box are some of my favourite models GW has ever put out. Got my  muskateers Imperial Knights on the go right now.The one purchase Ive always wanted but never really went ahead with was some Elysians They just look so cool but I always assumed were too expensive. I finally put an order through for a few squads a couple of weeks ago and they shipped this morning. That will probably mark the end of all the models Ive wanted but never really gotten after this its just things like the warhound and warlord which I know Ill never get.

10565402,0,t3_5raler,In order to play the game you need the basic rulebook and your armys codex. The Space Marine Codex is here and includes the rules for running White Scars. Space Marines in general have Chapter Tactics which give your Marines special rules to help represent the different groups. White Scars is among the Chapter Tactics you can select and they can pick almost any of the options out of the Space Marines book. You can paint them up like White Scars or you can make up your own successor Chapter that uses the same rules with a different paint scheme. Its up to you.As far as starting out I highly recommend the Kill Team box Not only does it come with a full rulebook for much cheaper than buying it separately it comes with  Tactical Marines you can paint up as White Scars. It also comes with a squad of Tau Fire Warriors you can use to introduce your friends to the game and the rules for Kill Team which lets you play very small games using ks ruleset to represent squadonsquad combat rather than armyonarmy.Once you feel more confident with that you can move on to the Start Collecting! Space Marines box which comes with a leader another squad of Tacticals and a Dreadnought a perfect collection to start playing small games of k. After that Id buy some Rhinos for your dudes to roll around in and then some Space Marine Bikes because theyre the most iconic unit in a White Scars army. After that growing the army is up to you.,Warhammer40k,dd5phrd,3,t5_2rr81

10574616,0,t1_dd6ccjn,Just use a spray primer. I used gws army painters and even krylon spray cans. Tbh I didnt notice a huge difference between them other than price. Key is just to make quick passes so as not to let it build up and start running ruining and filling in details. Personally I always build larger models in sub assemblies. And even on infantry models I like to paint their arms and sometimes backpacks separately. It just makes it easier so youre not trying to jam your brush in at awkward angles. I also pin my models at those points if possible.  But it just depends on the model or if you even care about getting in those hard to reach areas. Just mind the glue when you go to final assembly. And keep a fan handy if you use super glue. I found that letting glue dry under a fan prevents crusty looking build up that can come from the fumes. You definitely dont want that on your fresh paint job. One painter on YouTube I watched a lot when I started was Buypainted. He doesnt make videos anymore but he had a nice technique that was a good influence to me. ,Warhammer40k,dd6ot4y,2,t5_2rr81

Do you want to play freedom fighters rising up from the grassroots? Stealing the very weapons and armor made to oppress you and turn them on the Imperials? Then hear the word of the arch demagogue and join the renegades and heretics! Weve got easily the most customizable armies in the game right now depending on your choices you can be a workers rebellion hereteks a rabble of outcast mutants or even a guard regiment that got fed up with their slavedrivers. We can do pretty much all the tricks guard can with some uniqueness and several goodies gifted straight from the Chaos Gods. All of our tanks are stolen from Imperial arsenals which are the absolute best of the best everything from flying taxis to Leman Russ squadrons Basilisk heavy artillery and THE BANEBLADE! so not only are we easy to field if you already have some guard models but weve also got lots of opportunities for fun conversions to represent local or chaotic icons and mutations. Our ogryns use industrial manufacturing equipment as power weapons and can take chaos marks our commissars can administer combat drugs when ordering a charge. Our troop slot has even greater potential than Imperial Guard because we can take worker rabble hordes without a platoon tax and our veterans can be upgraded to chaos stormtroopers!

10782475,0,t3_5u8nwn,I love my Templars and close combat but be aware that the space wolves will have the advantage in that area. Youll want a mix of melee and shooting units. Use your crusader squads to field lots of cheap neophytes in your squads to use as meat shields and extra attacks. Properly equipped crusader squads can take out Tau units in close combat but are otherwise only adequate assault units although being able to hide a power weapon or power fist in a mass of bodies has its advantages. Sadly the cost of power weapons makes an initiate with a power weapon more expensive than a similarly equipped vanguard vet who also has better stats and the honor guard who have  saves if you cant tell Im annoyed with how expensive power weapons are. Against Tau accepted that you cant out shoot them and use your short units to hold objectives and pick off support units like pathfinders. Get yourself some transports to get you assault units down the board in hopefully one piece. Without their marker lights theyre vulnerable so take them out quickly. Cover saves dont apply in close combat so hopefully your assault units can do something against stealth units and dug in infantry. As for space wolves use shooting and pick off their tougher units from afar. They will most likely rush you so at least your assault units wont have to trudge the field under much fire. I dont have much experience against them but try to outnumber them and if you use a LRC with a crusader squad remember that it gets objective secured so sit it on an important objective. For orks I have even less experience but theyre considered a really weak army right now so most space marine builds can take them out. I dont use formations with my friends but I hear skyhammer is insanely effective and has a close quarters black Templar feel to it. ,Warhammer40k,dds4tsv,1,t5_2rr81

They can be okayish for picking off really small weak units if they dont just get gunned down by small arms fire first. A Solitaire is not going to wipe out a unit and move on to another one or if it does they were sucky units that the opponent likely doesnt mind you sacrificing your overpriced single model to kill.I would love for Solitaires to be feared theyre supposed to be some of the most deadly beings in the galaxy.

10842623,0,t3_5v0iei,gt  I like Space Marines but I dont know what to pick. Im struggling between Dark Angels Black Templars and Space Wolves. What are the differences?Dark Angels and Space Wolves have their own seperate codex since they have a lot of special rules. Black Templars still have their own rules but not as many and are thus confined within the ordinary Space Marine Codex. Generally this is down to whatever you thinkk is the coolest so I say read the lore and backstories of them. Just search here and youll find plenty of stories and information about these armies. There are noticeable differences as to how they play too. Dark Angels Lots of shooting good plasma weapons. Commonly use attack bikes and terminators. Black Templars Mostly normal space marines but with a slight emphasis on melee combat. Space Wolves Very unique space marines with a lot of special units and characters. Enormous focus on melee combat. gt Im a total beginner in this field and I know nothing in terms of what is good or what I need to look out for. Dont worry too much about what is good. The meta changes every edition. The good armies today could easily be suboptimal a few years from now. The number one rule is to pick the army that you think is the coolest in my opinion. Most of your time spent in the hobby is not playing the game. Its honestly only about  of it. The remaining  of the hobby is spent collecting reading assembling and painting. I guess what Im trying to say is dont focus too much on the tabletop performance of your first army gt Furthermore Im also interested in Chaos Space Marines and Eldar what do you recommend of these three? Again depends on what you personally think is the coolest. By pure tabletop performance the Eldar are the best but again tabletop performance is not the most important thing when choosing your first army. Go with your gut. gt How do I build a army what do I need?You need at the bare minimum the codex two troop choices and an HQ if your army has one. You should get a rulebook too but you dont need to get one right away. The most costeffective way to get started is generally with the Get Started! sets. These will include the most essential units to begin playing a given army. You can honestly play a lowpoints game with just one of these boxes. Best thing Games Workshop has done in years in my opinion. Once you pick one of these boxes get a codex some paints you dont need to go overboard and whatever tools you need to paint and assemble. There are also some other ways to get started too. If youre thinking about Dark Angels andor Chaos then the Dark Vengeance set is absolutely fantastic value. If you dont want the other army then you can put it up for sale on ebay or find someone else who is willing to swap with you. Just be careful if handling this swap online of course. gt How do I move on after this?Once you have the basics assembled and painted then you can go any direction you want really. If you want to keep expanding your army then set a goal for yourself.  points is a pretty good target. A lot of people play at that point level. Build an experimental list first you can google Warhammer k army builder of what stuff you want and if youre not sure run it by this subreddit or your friends and see what they think of it. Once youre set on something then use that list as a shopping guide. Edit Some other useful resourcesWarhammer TV Is the official Warhammer youtube channel. There are painting tutorials for a lot of units on there that teach you how to achieve the paint quality that you see in the codex and rule books. If you cant find what you are looking for here then just search on youtube in general. Theres a tutorial somewhere for almost every model in the game. Miniwargaming Good channel with high quality videos. They do Battle Reports where you can learn how to play the game from watching them. If they did battle reports for the army that you are interested in then even better! They have a lot of space marines chaos space marines tyranids and eldar on there. They also have some painting tutorials too. Battlescribe Use this to build army lists on your computer. dchan.org A nonserious wiki.

10999023,0,t3_5x0qkp,What I would expect should this happen is two things. The first is that GW comes out with two iterations of the rules. A barebones free to read and access set of rules which is solely the rules and nothing else and then stuff like  a traditional rulebook and codex which is all the rules and stats as well as that gorgeous art and fluff. It would definitely lower the barrier of entry somewhat since a lot of people find paying  for a rulebook distasteful.Down here however it wouldnt boost GW sales very much as the main barrier for entry in good old Aus is the price so unless th edition also coincides with an end to GWs price gouging I dont forsee a huge bump in sales here.,Warhammer40k,deepfga,1,t5_2rr81

The method is quick and dirty and my focus is less on perfection and more getting good looking models on the table quick with a fun theme.The green and white are set in stone. Im really liking how they look.My problem comes to the weapons that hang out underneath. I was originally thinking yellow or orange to be different and separate them from the Tau.However Im still liking red for weapon systems. Kinda creates a unifying theme with the Tau with the red and white. Not sure which way to lean with the eldar weapon color. Thoughts?,Warhammer40k,denkzxp,12,t5_2rr81

For the past three months Ive been working on a Start Collecting! Box as well as an Armored Fist Box. While assembling and painting my miniatures Ive been lurking on the subreddit and Id like to thank everyone for their contributions theyve been a major inspiration to get all of my minis to a table top standard. Here are my nearly finished Cadians CampC is appreciated. Im really excited to get back into the hobby Im having a great time but I also have a couple questions.Since returning the LGS I previously went to has closed and Im currently looking for a store in Northern Maryland primarily Harford County. Ive been traveling about an hour to play games which isnt awful especially because Im really happy with the store. However traveling an hour to and from the location can be a bit of a hassle.Has anyone used the Agrellan Earth texture paint from GW Ive been basing my miniatures with sand and painting it but Id like to dirty up my tanks a little bit. I think it would be a really good method of dirtying up the treads but Im a little worried about the shelf life. Since its a texture paint I feel like the usual tricks to preserving paints may not be as effective or work at all.Thanks again  Red ,Warhammer40k,dfcagje,8,t5_2rr81

My Bloodclaws come blazing in and kill most of the grotling crew. The grotlings then managed to wipe out the entire Bloodclaws unit. The Zzap guns free once again to fire on the next turn zzaped and destroyed my Venerable Dreadnought HQ right before he was preparing to unleash death upon the Ork Warboss.

11371423,0,t1_dfkti3v,No. The Necrons are against the warp in general. They literally cant use it. They do however have the technological means to suppress it developed because it was weaponized against them in The War In Heaven. For instance some Tomb Worlds are protected by null fields where the warp just doesnt work at all. The Pylons obviously from Fall of Cadia could calm the warp in a passive state and in their active state were powerful enough to cause Psykers considerable agony as they were cut off rip daemons from infested technology and throw them back into the warp cause daemons to just flicker out of existence and even start to slowly shrink the Eye of Terror.The Necrons are what the flesh and blood Necrontyr became with the assistance of the Ctan to try and win their war against the Old Ones. They werent doing so great against the Old Ones in flesh and blood bodies. Their upgrades helped immensely and the Old Ones had to step up their game and shit got real.The Eldar And the predecessors of the modern day Ork were created by the Old Ones for the sole purpose of being powerful psychic weapons to use in their war against the Necrons.Necrons and Eldar both predate Chaos. Chaos came into being because the Old Ones kept creating new weapons to fight the Necrons such as the Orks and the Eldar which all really messed up the warp which was quite calm before that war and led to the current state of things starting with The Enslaver Plague Which was the point where the Old Ones basically lost the war.During that war as a response to all the warp fuckery the Old Ones were throwing at them the Necrons started a project to suppress the warp galaxywide but ended up winning their war and taking a longass nap before they finished. Abaddon has since destroyed what remained of it with Cadia being the last planet known of in that project. The goal was a galaxywide network of Pylons that would have completely cut it off from real space.,Warhammer40k,dfkxh6a,5,t5_2rr81

11460863,0,t1_dfv1883,I played in a v game a month ago and it was the most fun Ive had in a long time. In games that big players have an opportunity to take units that they might never take in a normal game due to their being suboptimal. In a massive game theres so much going on no one can be bothered to target your suboptimal units and they actually get a chance to do something.In addition these games are just so massively epic in scale. When I play I want titantic  point armies on battlefields that are  feet by  feet. THATs what I want to play.As for Formations and such I have two arguments in favor. The first is that it gives new players who might be overwhelmed by all the model choices a template of what to get next. Oh so a Gladius has three tactical squads a dreadnought a devastator squad a captain and an assault squad? Cool now I have a guide for where to head.The second is that I dont give a crap about finding the strongest formation. Different formations can represent different army types in the fluff and I can take the one that fits my theme. Going for an Iyanden Wraith army? Cool theres a formation that represents that well and gives you relevant bonuses. A lot of my preferences stem from one thing I dont care about winning the game. Winning is not the objective of playing to me. The act of playing the game is the fun part for me. I guess thats probably my real controversial opinion.,Warhammer40k,dfv2xz0,9,t5_2rr81

11628694,0,t1_dgdxpyf,I think they wanted the armor to be the benefit itself the wearer without the armor is a genetically enhanced human so I would imagine the toughness represents their resilience as a whole... which... doesnt really explain why bikes make you more resilient sure.I could understand cavalry mounts abstraction as shots have a chance of hitting the supposedly tougher mount instead of the rider  which could also explain the bike abstraction but that doesnt really have anything to do with armor and thus terminator armor just gives a decent save.  Armor modifiers seem better as a whole I think the whole ap spam meta has trivialized what is supposed to be a really tough to kill unit by just removing the only thing that ever made them so effective their armor save.As a result armor saves are  times out of  completely worthless as everyone spams ap at a minimum since MEQs are the standard stat line in the game.  It absolutely sucks failing a  charge and then having an ap pie plate staring you down and having zero way to save face besides completely screwing yourself over going to ground which then results in you repeatedly pinning that unit until they all eventually die to the blast  but in my experience a  cover save doesnt save anything ,Warhammer40k,dge4ibh,1,t5_2rr81

Its geared towards survival and shooting for the command squad and you can replace the grav guns on the marines with plasma or flamers or meltas depending on what you want them to do. The attack bikes give you fast anti tank. Its pretty well balanced for the most part but it might require buying a bunch of grav gun bits to make. You also might not need to go so grav heavy but grav on bikes is great because if its too bad of an armour save for you to wound them easily with the grav you can just use your twin linked bolters on them instead. ,Warhammer40k,dgmlbys,2,t5_2rr81
