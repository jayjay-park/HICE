542524,0,t3_20ayzj,I choose to deliberately misinterpret the title of this series as a guide for new people as in newborns as opposed to people new to jitter.,MaxMSP,cg1xwcm,1,t5_2s9jm

2408613,0,t1_cm9eiit,The search path should be fine  this is already a subpatch were talking about and Max was able to find that no problem. When I tried your example it seemed like I was able to load in my .txt okay but when I doubleclicked the coll the window it popped up was empty  it had the right file name but none of the contents of the .txt file.,MaxMSP,cm9ew9y,1,t5_2s9jm

If you get that bang to increase a number that is depended on in order to play the audio file you should be on your way,MaxMSP,co8lu8g,3,t5_2s9jm

4307324,0,t3_3abgaf,In addition to online tutorials Max has great builtin tutorials and patchers that you can unlock copy paste and tinker. I would recommend going through all the Max and MSP tutorials at least as they explain the concepts in addition to key objects. You can find the tutorials in the Help menu. There is also an Object Explorer and the search capabilities within Max Reference. The individual object references are helpful and have examples that you can again unlock copy paste and tinker. There are also links to other similar objects at the bottom of the object reference pages. If you make changes to the referencestutorial patchers do not save changes!For your ambitious project just start where you can and actively seek out objects and their functions. There are many ways to get to an end result in Max so it doesnt matter if you dont make it the most efficient or prettiest the first time have fun learning it and making it work. The best thing to do is play and learn. ,MaxMSP,csb5t1h,1,t5_2s9jm
4360645,0,t1_csh64j9,Yep. Thats the exact method I was thinking of trying. I was just going to put velostat on the back of the kick drum. ,MaxMSP,csh6fj3,1,t5_2s9jm
4466436,0,t3_3c9u07,I wouldnt worry too much switching between then is not that hard. Its just a question of getting used to the new layout.,MaxMSP,csto5tc,1,t5_2s9jm
4934990,0,t1_cugl34q,The problem I found with them is that in smoothing out the jumps in the data stream they also slow it down too much. When using a head tracker with those methods Ive found that the sound doesnt always keep up with the head movements. Although there is a large possibility Im implementing them incorrectly. ,MaxMSP,cuglf80,1,t5_2s9jm

10104120,0,t1_dbnpgqd,As an addition to this University courses that specialise in teaching DSP and audio software design through Max will at one point usually very often reference the work of Cipriani and Giri. Volume  was my goto book for many of my student Max projects everything is explained technically but simply. Another decent barebones introduction to Max and Jitter is a textbook by V.J. Manzo entitled MaxMSPJitter for Music A Practical Guide to Developing Interactive Music Systems... which is much more musical than some of the other Max books that I have read.,MaxMSP,dbokui2,1,t5_2s9jm
