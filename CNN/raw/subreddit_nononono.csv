3110054,0,t1_cokcla2,Yea that wont happen. I love viewing these.From the   website FAQgt Cant the road be lowered?gt gt That would be prohibitively expensive because a sewer main runs just a few feet below the road bed. That sewer main also dates back about a hundred years and again at the time there were no real standards for minimum clearance for railroad underpasses.gt gt Cant the bridge be raised?gt gt Here too the question is who would want to pay the millions of dollars to raise the tracks a couple of feet? To accomplish this the grade of the tracks would have to changed on both sides of the trestle probably for several miles. That would require rebuilding all trestles in Durham. And NS would have to shut down this busy track for months. I dont think they are interested in that idea.gt gt Is the signeage inadequate?gt gt The signeage is pretty good. Large signs alert driver to the low clearance several blocks before the bridge. Overheight vehicles trip a light switch that turns on flashing warning lights.right at the bridge.gt gt Should there be more signeage?gt gt Its hard to see how more lowclearance signs will significantly improve the situation. But maybe a different kind of signeage would get the drivers attention.gt gt Could they install a lowclearance bar?gt gt A low clearance bar is a bar suspended by chains ahead of the bridge. Overheight vehicles hit that bar first and the noise alerts the driver to to the problem. I understand that this approach has been successful in other places but its not practical here. There are many overheight trucks that have to be able to drive right up to the bridge and turn onto Peabody St. in order to deliver supplies to several restaurants. Making Peabody St inaccessible from Gregson St would make the restaurant owners and the delivery drivers very unhappy.gt gt Why are they using yellow flashing lights?gt gt Warning lights have to be yellow according to the NC traffic laws.,nononono,cokctbn,13,t5_2w1gn

The aircrew could mishear their runway designation or the signs could be poorly marked or whatever  but ATC shouldve realized immediately that they were on the wrong runway and aborted their takeoff or corrected them at any point during their taxi. They put windows on the control tower for a reason. Literally half of ATCs job is to control ground operations of aircraft. The pilots knew which runway to go to they just stopped on the wrong runway. While they are immediately at fault for using the wrong runway ATC absolutely bears a significant amount of responsibility for this. But since it was a governmentrun airport they were granted basically immunity and absolved of all responsibility.Getting to runway  required crossing runway .

4667014,0,t3_3esh78,In the Netherlands there are similar traffic lights for cyclists and pedestrians that are basically a strip of LEDs. Once the last one goes out the light goes green.Except the rate at which the LEDs go out is random and no matter the speed it can randomly stop counting down at the last second. So a situation like this happens often where people anticipate a green light only for the timer to randomly stop.This can happen for example because vehicles like emergency services and public transport somehow get priority once they near such intersections overriding the counter.Dangerous system giving people a false sense of security is there a crappydesign section for stuff like this?,nononono,ctitxm1,1,t5_2w1gn

4693616,0,t1_cteoz93,Definitely not the case in the US.  Its very possible for pedestrians to be at fault in a pedestrianvehicle accident.  Jaywalking is a big one for that but darting into traffic crossing against signal being where pedestrians are prohibited such as under or on top of certain bridges or simply being intoxicated while crossing the road can cause pedestrian fault.  There are also cases of partial fault in most states reducing possible damages awards from suits.Bicycles riders can also be at fault in many jurisdictions if they enter a crosswalk without dismounting their bicycle.  This actually happened to my mother in Colorado she struck a cyclist that approached from the sidewalk to her rear and entered the crosswalk just as my mother made a right turn.  The cyclist was ticketed.Basically the common adage that the drive is always at fault is frankly incorrect.  They are in most cases assigned at least partial fault but theres plenty of legal fault for the pedestrians to accrue as well.  Same applies to rearending another car the driver doing the rearending is not always at fault.,nononono,ctm66op,1,t5_2w1gn

5276686,0,t1_cvm1437,Firstly I explicitly said I was oversimplifying things. Secondly the physics you learn in class are serious oversimplifications of the real world specifically the oversimplification of assuming everything to be a rigid body. This is simply not true. In fact if tires were to be rigid there would be no friction between the tires and the pavement since the realworld coefficient of friction if a tire on various surfaces is a function of slip such that where the slip is zero so too us the coefficient of friction.Slip practically speaking here is the deformation of the tire. Your stating that contact patch does not matter is frankly ridiculous. I understand where youre coming from if all that you think about is classroom equations but there are dozens of clear realworld examples that prove you wrong. Plenty of car videos where using wider tires produces higher skid pan acceleration or if you want something more direct drag a sheet of plywood across a surface with just a corner in contact with the surface then drag it with its full surface in contact with the groundpavementfloor. The difference should be readily apparent.In both math and physics you need to keep track of your assumptions. Theyre important and in some cases your assumption like assuming rigid bodies with the car tire will lead to a significantly incorrect conclusion.,nononono,cvm5nhf,11,t5_2w1gn

6137475,0,t1_cymyz81,That is called liftoff oversteer. Subarus are very prone to it. Heres some other examples.It happens when you come in to a turn with the throttle open. As you start to turn on Subarus you lose grip first on the rear wheels and the normal reaction is to let go off the throttle and turn slightly in the other direction. If you would have been in a RWD car this would be the correct reaction and it would straighthen out the car.On Subarus however the weight transfer from releasing the throttle will decrease the grip on the rear wheels causing the car to spin. Increasing throttle which is counterintuitive will push more of the weight of the car on the rear tires giving more grip and stopping the slide.,nononono,cyn9lmv,4,t5_2w1gn

In a lot of protocols nowadays though cardiac arrest patients are never even taken to the ambulance and CPR will be stopped in the field with permission from a medical director if we cant get a pulse back after a certain amount of time. Its near impossible to ensure quality CPR is being performed while moving a patient to the ambulance or during transport and in most cases the ER cant do much more for patient in cardiac arrest than we can in the field so patients are worked on scene until either they regain a pulse or the decision is made to stop resuscitative efforts.  ,nononono,d063hd3,2,t5_2w1gn

If that means a person or an animal dies from being struck by the vehicle then so be it. Not really much different from a human driver doing it and it happens many times every single day. A careless pedestrian being struck by an autonomous vehicle isnt any different from a careless worker being killed by a factory robot. If anything it would happen way less often because the vehicle would see the danger way before a human does. The autonomous vehicle would also take proactive measures to avoid dangerous situations and not drive in such a manner that would prevent it from reacting to dangerous situations. The automakers programming cars to kill its occupants would be legal suicide and it would give malicious people a new thing to potentially exploit. ,nononono,d1gpmb3,2,t5_2w1gn

Its not a huge deal but its a screwup.Instead he reaches up grabs the rope and does enough of a onearmed pullup that he can bust the prussik knot and put all the weight on his tiedoff figure . This allows him to continue the rappel without the loop nonsense.To be certain he didnt do a complete onearmed pullup with another guy tied into his harness but still a pretty impressive feat.

Her continued downward energy would also transfer to at least some of the now broken shards of glass. Some of that glass might receive additional energy due to the force of water pushing it away from the tank which could combine with her transferred energy to cause that glass to hit the ground before her.Some of the glass however would not receive as much energy or that energy might be forcing the glass in a different direction. Theres a lot of different variables going on in the gif. Some of the glass and water will hit the ground before she does. Some of the glass and water will land on her after she hits the ground.I mean we dont have highspeed camera sources to look at. Its possible that the initial force of her impact cracked the glass in such a way that the portions of broken glass at the bottom of the broken areas were forced down as soon as the cracks formed due to the rest of the glass above receiving her energy.

The history were taught in school is incredibly basic and often does push an agenda that sometimes skews what is taught. For exampleWe arent taught that at the height of slavery only  of white owned slaves or that  blacks owned slaves.We arent taught that tribes sold slaves to slave traders.Were not taught about the Irish slave trade only African. In fact historians agree that rds of white Americans came to the colonies in some form of bondage.This is only going back two pages too. I didnt even bother quoting your ranting about BLM being full of cop killers or your weird obsession with Donald Trump and NAMBLA. I hate to tell you this bro but you are racist as fuck and also a little weird.,nononono,d6goqnw,2,t5_2w1gn

Man Marshall is a great guy. Hed come into my security booth while working then night shift and wed always talk about whether or not Linda would be late again to work. He hated Linda being that it was her direct manager and she was always on his case about he desk being a bit cluttered than shed like. He called her turbo thighs because she liked to power walk up and down the corridor at work yet still her thighs remained the same size. He told me she would power walk the corridor EVERY day at pm. Back and forth back and forth. Til one day he wanted to put a stop to it. The jingling of her keys and the swish sounds of her pants made him infuriated. So one day at pm Linda started as usual.

The grease fire for example. Your instinct upon seeing fire is to grab water and pour it on the fire.

I think bailing is probably the best option if a collision is imminent. Of course it might be best to do it earlier and run perpendicularly as far as you can. At the angle the trains collided it seems like the cars might tip over near where the other guy landed.

So one wave that crashes over and knocks the rescue swimmer into the jetty and its game over for both swimmer and the mouth breather in the truck. Let alone the water slamming the truck into the swimmer. Coast Guard does train for this along with a thousand other things.

Disconnect the battery?  Gonna keep running.  I probably wasted half a gallon of fuel trying to figure out how to shut off a damn diesel engine lol.  Never would have though work lights would be the fuse that would have affected that.Also a runaway diesel is a thing where its burning oil and it just keeps going generally not on a tractor because this usually happens from blown out turbo seals blowing oil into the intake.,nononono,dg59no0,2,t5_2w1gn
