It has a name a position  orientation scale and a list of components.Components include renderers physics components and scripted behaviors.You dont need a behavior to setup an actor with a physics component or a renderer you can simply do    let myActor  new Sup.ActorMy Actor    new Sup.SpriteRenderermyActor ...  setup a sprite on the actor    new Sup.ArcadePhysicsD.BodymyActor ...  setup a arcade body on the actorThe exact arguments to pass are in the TypeScript API browser looks for constructor....Heres an example for Sup.ArcadePhysicsD.Body    new Sup.ArcadePhysicsD.BodymyActor Sup.ArcadePhysicsD.BodyType.Box  movable false width  height  A scripted behavior is just a special type of component where you provide the initialization awake method and update update method behavior by writing a class in your scripts instead of relying on something provided to you like a renderer or physics component.To add a behavior to an actor you can use myActor.addBehaviormyBehaviorClass. Its a bit of an exception for technical reasons all the other components are added by doing new Sup.NameOfTheComponentmyActor ...,superpowers,crgzawv,2,t5_2tie0
