473793,0,t1_cfu1joe,No industry is easy to get in to with or without a degree. That is part of the entrylevel market and job placement factor. To think it is unique to IT is a bit myopic.You can work your way up but you will have to work harder and longer to get to the same place that a degree would you put you at in a shorter time period. I do not have a degree and work as a regional IT manager but what should have only taken me three years took me almost eight and I still make  less than my peers of equal experience.If I want to move past middlemanagement to a DirectorClevel it will be EXTREMELY tough for me to do without a degree. On top of that I will likely not be compensated appropriately. The compensation is where you typically take the tradeoff on not having a degree. I also say typically because there are always exceptions but it is far from the norm.,ITCareerQuestions,cfu4fkr,1,t5_30560

To that end dont talk about your lofty goals and aspirations unless asked. Talk about times when youve gone the extra mile when youve solved problems creatively when youve identified a problem and driven it to resolution. Stuff like that indicates motivation. Do not have your friend lose his job by sharing the hiring managers email addresses with you. Terrible idea. It surely violates your employment agreement with your temp agency. Likewise you have no business talking to your employers the temp agency that pays you customers the interviewers. Even if it were a position within that company it would be horribly inappropriate.

In many cases you will be more in meetings than in front of a computer and the computer work is more of a as long as you get it done doesnt matter when you do it type of situation.But again it always comes down to the employer.  Some companies may be less flexible others more.  Me im in sales engineering.  I will likely work from home all week from a dark room  on webexs and conference calls and such.

There may also be weeks were im running around the city every day from meeting to meeting and working after hours at home to get something completed or reproduce an issue a customer had.  Im lucky that over the last  years my jobs have been very flexible. I will also add that over time more and more companies seem to be embracing the telecommute idea.

3947969,0,t1_cr678x9,The crappy thing about tech degrees finally starting to permeate higher education is... the name a university uses to describe a degree might mean a completely other thing at a different school.  For example youre really throwing me off by saying CSIT or CSMIS because to me CS IT and MIS are three different flavors of degrees.  ...and theres even more!  Like software engineering  But its not that I dont believe you!  Im sure plenty of schools are mashing those together lately and it sounds like what your school has done here and that might be leading you down the wrong path.Typically CS is very math and coding intensive.  Algorithms data structures etc.  I shopped around universities in my area for a masters in CS and the three I considered were even very different one was very tied with robotics and engineering.  Another seemed to have an abundance of visualgraphics programming courses Youd definitely use all that math for those!  And then another just kind of had a meh curriculum the kind you go to just to get the basics and a diploma in hand.And MIS instead of being tied to the math department is usually tied to the business school.  The math here is important too but youll likely not have to go too much higher than an advanced statistics course and theyll all have that businessanalyst flavor like the accounting class you mention.Then you have your classic IT.  A lot of these programs will require a class or two above college algebra but you wont use much more than that on the job.  This is more in line with the fun experience you had in HS and will expand on that A cert you got along with getting into network security system analysisdesign databases etc.Now like I said a university can and will mash up a lot of those areas together so the best thing you can do is really dig into all the required courses of the degree program and figure out what that degree is really going to teach you.  If you like IT going down CS or MIS might be a mistake.  I like coding for example so maybe I could do CS but I want to puke every time I hear a technology manager open their mouth a spew business filth...  I could never do an MIS degree because of the career path its geared for.Sorry I might have oversimplified things here but the combination of computer science with IT or MIS just seems misleading to me.  Really look at the course requirements and see what job that degree is really prepping you for.  Your first one sounds like a classic CS style degree even if they are putting IT in the name.,ITCareerQuestions,cr6awso,3,t5_30560
3955853,0,t3_35p7il, You may have heard the inspirational phrase If you dont ask the answer is always no. But what if you do ask and the answer is still no? Particularly when it comes to asking for a raise that is not the desired outcome especially because it will likely be a while before you work up the courage to ask again.Thankfully you can get it right the first time by knowing how to ask. To help you get that yes youre looking for weve compiled several donts to remember. Dont come to the table emptyhandedGathering the courage to ask for a raise is difficult  but as momentous as it seems the simple act of asking will not get the job done for you. You need to come armed with information facts and proof points that you deserve the extra pay says Jennifer Doran consultant program manager at IT staffing firm Teksystems in Baltimore.Relevant information can include accomplishments youve achieved for your team or the company or responsibilities youve taken on outside your normal role. That might give your manager pause to think maybe an increase is warranted based on that new information Doran says.Dont assume your boss has this information at the top of his mind says Ashley Leonard president and CEO of Verismic Software. Make sure you have strong points that justify the raise he says. Do you volunteer for projects? Have you taken responsibility beyond your current level of pay? Describe these objectively to speak appropriately on your own behalf. Dont aim too highYou should also know the dollar amount youre asking for Doran says to validate a compensation range. This means researching your market value by talking to recruiters and people in the industry. Make sure your expectations are realistic that your request meets the role youre providing to the organization Doran says.In other words know your worth says Tyler Mikkelson team lead at technology talent recruiter Mondo in Chicago. Be prepared to discuss how much money you saved the company how much revenue you generated new leadership tasks youve taken on Mikkelson says. Facts and figures will go a long way.Be prepared to discuss how much money you saved the company how much revenue you generated new leadership tasks youve taken on.Tyler Mikkelson team lead at technology talent recruiter MondoResearching the compensation of your industry peers can also keep you from asking for an exorbitant amount Mikkelson says. Merit increases are usually  on the low end and  on the high end he says. Asking for  or  will make you look foolish he says. Thats a promotion not a raise in your current role. Dont gamble on the counterofferOf course your research into equitable pay may lead you to find an attractive job opening. Be careful however about using an offer as a lever to improve your negotiating position says Marty Fredo IT branch manager at staffing firm Addison Group in New York City. You might think Now Im in a powerful position  I can tell my boss Id like to stay but that hell have to bring my salary up by  he says.But what youre really doing is forcing your bosss hand Fredo says which is not a good foundation for a future relationship especially if budget cuts or other organizational changes occur. Youve acknowledged that youre actively interviewing and went so far as to get an offer vs. Bob Smith who comes to work on time and leaves late he says.Leonard calls this holding yourself for ransom. Threatening to leave and noting that your love is for sale comes across as manipulative and at the very least shows that youve been job hunting  not something most people do when they love what they do Leonard says. If you really do have an outside offer bring it up late in the discussion but only if you must. Be very clear that the offer found you without seeking it out and be willing to move to the new company if this discussion causes problems. Dont use emailNo matter how intimidated you may feel about the ensuing conversation its too important to discuss over email Leonard says. Always find the courage to speak to your supervisor inperson when asking for a raise he says. Resorting to longdistance communication shows a lack of decorum and consideration for privacy as email is never  confidential.Schedule a oneonone so you have ample time for a discussion Doran says. Be prepared that the answer may not be resolved that day and may require a few followup meetings she adds. Dont be informalEven if you have a great personal relationship with your boss you should strike a professional tone when asking for a raise. Dont be overly lighthearted or self deprecating Doran says. If you want to be taken seriously you need to convey confidence. You need to know why you deserve a raise and be able to articulate that clearly.You might even want to stage a minirehearsal Doran says. Think about the questions you might be asked and how you might present your information she says. Bounce it off your spouse friend or peers so that youre able to articulate that information more clearly.While you should avoid an overly aggressive selfpitch you should be clear compelling and onpoint Leonard agrees. Practice stating your reasons assertively yet concisely and politely. Dont think shorttermThe time to begin planning to ask for a raise is not the week before the conversation but at your performance review Fredo says. This allows you to be proactive about setting goals for the year that  if you hit them  can help bolster your argument for a higher salary. Decide on what you want to achieve and research the price points for those skills or positions he says. If that includes certification know what the market is for that. Dont get personalIn some cases raise requests are precipitated by real financial needs  youre buying a house getting married having a baby however its not appropriate to share those personal needs or financial predicaments with your manager both Doran and Mikkelson say. Your boss might empathize with you but you need to keep it about your work the company and your performance Mikkelson says.You also wont earn any points by complaining about your current salary or how long its been since youve seen a pay increase. Dont talk about not having had a raise in two years Mikkelson says. Doing so could actually hurt you in the long run as it could point to how long youve been complacent. Dont base your request on coworker comparisonsIts never an easy moment to hear that someone you consider an equal is making more than you however this is not a good conversationstarter Mikkelson says. Youll come off looking very gossip petty or bitter he says.The pay another employee receives usually has nothing to do with your pay Leonard agrees. Most managers are instructed to give raises  beyond normal costofliving  only under certain conditions such as an employee completing specialized training he says. Be sure to focus solely on your own performance and value you bring to the company. Another peril Leonard says is that in most companies employees are not allowed  by contract  to discuss their pay with coworkers so mentioning that to your superiors is akin to admitting to a wrongdoing. Dont neglect timingLastly IT is always being told to know the business and this is definitely true when it comes to timing your raise request. If youre noticing big profit margins or that the company is exceeding its goals thats a good time to ask especially if youve been a part of that success Mikkelson says. On the other hand if no one is getting bonuses and theres talk of layoffs thats not a good time even if your own business area is doing fine. Theyll value the fact that you worked through the hard time and when the company comes out of it thats the time to ask. ,ITCareerQuestions,cr778rl,1,t5_30560

4109530,0,t3_37od8b,In a job search there are several things that will get you to an interview. Credentials  the very first thing I look at on a resume is the education section.  In particular Im looking for a  year degree what schools you attended and what training beyond school youve had.. Experience  longer jobs at bigger companies means a stable worker.  Job hopping is a killer   different jobs in  years means I shouldnt count on more than  months from this guy.. Referrals  THIS is the area that youre probably going to have to lean on.  You didnt post your resume so Im making some assumptions but my initial assumption is that in a stack of  resumes yours and  others are going to look so similar as to be identical.  At that point you have to keep your fingers crossed that the other  were worse and not better and that yours gets randomly picked from among the  for an interview.  Not good odds.So youre really going to have to count on networking to get you in the door.  Bulk up your LinkedIn go to some industry events all the big tech companies host them and start making some connections.  ,ITCareerQuestions,cropmn9,2,t5_30560

4127758,0,t3_37vk20,Most of the MIS programs that Ive looked at are about  Businessmaterial  AppDevmaterial and  InfoTechmaterial.  The most common or obvious roles include but are not limited to    Project Management  Business Analyst  Technical Analyst  Security Administration  DBA Report GenerationManagementProject Managers and BizTech Analysts are often in an interesting position to receive unusually high or frequent levels of bonus compensation.  Those job positions put you right in the face of business internalcustomers that want something specific.  Sometimes they have no idea exactly what they want but they know they need it.  An example  Our business unit just got crushed in a professional trade journal for having the worst call center hold times in our market segment.  This has been determined to be a priority issue for the division.  You have  days to figure out where the problem is.  We would very much like a solution implemented for your findings by end of year.  You will use billing code ABC for this project.  If you need more than the K weve initially set aside for this just let us know and well find more money.  Go forth and fix this.  We  need to be improved before this time next year.  A second review like that will hurt more than we want to think about.  So now youre going to have to spend a few weeks learning how the call center works.  How they interact with whatever customer service management system the business operates with.  Is the system slow?  Or inefficient too many clicks or keystrokes to execute specific tasks?  Is the phone system configured correctly to make best use of call center resources?  Could Call Management automation get the caller to enter in more basic info so the agent doesnt have to collect it?  Your business courses help you understand how these functions are used and appreciate why they are important to the operation of a business.  Your handful of AppDev courses help you understand and appreciate that ANYTHING is possible with a good crew of developers.  Software can be changed almost anyway you need it changed assuming you have time amp money.  We dont need you to write the code  just translate the requirements clearly using the language the developers need.  Your handful of InfoSystems courses help you by providing a warm amp fuzzy feeling that the network or server environment might be slow if its taking  seconds to complete a page load on every single web presentation of the customer management system.  You arent an expert at configuring a router but when you throw  pings at the main web server for this system and you see wild and crazy response times and packet loss your internal alarms are going nuts.  Its time to engage more resources as this needs more attention.  So long story short... you investigate.  You find issues.  You engage the teams that can best solve those issues.  You analyze how they use software and recommend some improvements to the UI and workflow.  Your team makes this little world a much better place.  Next year the same trade journal makes a big deal about great improvements and how truly competitive your company is  perhaps not market segment leading but dramatically better and right in the proper ballpark with your peers.  This leads to positive increase in business not to mention the faster processing of widgets in general.  Your team was directly responsible for making this business unit better.  Profits are up perhaps not through the roof but up and customers are happier overall.  A good business shows appreciation for this kind of thing in the form of bonuses.  The Network Engineer that figure out that packet loss problem isnt getting a bonus.  The business doesnt know who we are.  The six developers that improved the UI of that app so it was more logical and required less typing arent getting bonuses either.  The business doesnt know who they are either.  The two Telecom specialists that tweaked the call centers call distribution process and IVR system to get more customer info up front arent getting bonuses either for the same reasons as before.  The business only knows and interacts with the Project Manager and hisher immediate team of Analysis.  You are the ones they remember.  You make it all happen in their eyes.  As a Senior Network Engineer Im ok with this relationship.  I want nothing to do with the  meetings you suffered through collecting the data that you needed to complete this project.  Want to know how to get me and my Technical peers to move a mountain for you?  Its easy.  Dont forget we helped make you look GOOD.  As a Senior Technical Specialist my base salary is probably bigger than yours.  So I will not hold that K bonus you just got against you.  You did way more of the work than I did.  But after you deposit the K aftertaxes from your bonus invite the key Technical players out for lunch or drinks as a thankyou.  Ill order big and large when a VP is buying.  But only an ass would do that to a peer.  A couple simple pints or a decent burger might hit you for  for all of us  to maybe  key players generally.  Im confident you will find that there is a more than adequate return on that investment in our ongoing relationship.,ITCareerQuestions,crqsep8,2,t5_30560

4438771,0,t3_3bvm4u,Youve overlooked the most important factors to finding a job Where you live where youre willing to live and who can help you  how much help they can give should you decide to move. No matter what you know how to do or what your resume looks like the only way youll find employment is if the employers in your area are looking to hire in IT.Beyond that you have a nice array of technologies listed but its so varied that I have to ask how well you know each. Working with Active Directory isnt the same as having enough experience that you can convince someone to pay you to work with AD for them.Businesses exist to maximize their costbenefit ratio. Any company first has to have enough money that theyre able to hire someone to do something then has to decide that managing users with AD will provide the most benefit for the cost of hiring an AD administrator then in order to get the job youd still have to be the best most experienced admin who will perform the job for the least cost. With that in mind... do you still know AD well enough that a company can justify giving you tens of thousands of dollars just to manage AD? Most businesses will require applicants to already have  years experience in the field not school labsprojects to consider someone for the position of junior network administrator. Have you gathered that much experience with AD or followed a school lab to set permissions for  fake users to have read rights in a mounted directory? If its the latter then you may not even be considered for most jobs let alone be the best applicant.Follow a similar thought process for every tech up there... do you really know all of them that well or are some barely touched on and wouldnt be able to hit the ground running were you to be hired to do it? When writing your resume think about which tech would apply to the job and whether or not you know that tech well enough to be considered for the position. As youre sending out resumes modify your technologies list to match the posting.,ITCareerQuestions,csq6x2z,1,t5_30560

Its not impossible for earlycareer to be hired in as a consultant just uncommon.  Ive been a network engineer for  years now.  I dont see the cloud hurting the career significantly.  It may change how smallenvironment network engineers are usedengaged but I dont think  at this time  that the career field is in jeopardy.  Where the hell did you read that there would be no technology jobs in  years?  Thats a load of crap.  Software Defined Networking and all the geewhiz technologies that are working very hard to improve network automation and peel back some layers of complexity will make some bold strides in the next few years.  But assuming they get it working in the next  years it will take another  years to convince people that its reliable and worthy of trust.  From my perspective cloud computing makes your company even more dependant upon the Internet a networking technology than keeping things in house.  In house with the servers downstairs you have the safety net of lowlatency big bandwidth thanks to your nice stable LAN environment.  If you move everything into Amazon or Azure you have no idea where it is and how the latency might change as those providers shift loads around within their own network.  So one day everything works great when your apps are ms away in data center A.  But then they decide to shift loads around and move your apps amp data to Data Center B totally permitted within their usage agreements and everything hits ms and performance hits the toilet.  You gonna call the cloud provider to talk about your specific app?  You think thats going to be a productive conversation?  You gonna ask your IT Generalist ServerDesktopSQL Guy you hired when you didnt think you needed a network engineer anymore?  Or would you like to talk about virtual WAN Acceleration technologies with your onstaff Network Engineer?

5098448,0,t3_3kt3c0,In addition to what others have saidAnother foot in the door might be a software support job. The advantage here is that you will be paid about hr while you get an opportunity to work with programming languages. Front line support rarely works with source code but you may be working with a customerfacing API plugins etc. Most of your time however will be spent in the application itself so the job would focus primarily on coding. Imagine a support team for MS Word for example. It would be helpful to know VB because customers might use macros  but it wouldnt necessarily be a job requirement for all support engineers to know how to program in VB.Of course this is largely dependent on the job. From my practical experience though it is possible. I can definitely recommend business reporting software companies as a place that you might want to start looking. Theres probably other options as well. Also note The opportunity to study doesnt necessarily mean that your employer will teach you. They may encourage you to take classes. They may let you do your own thing allowing you to spend some time each day at work learning about it. They may expose you to technologies where understanding programming is useful but give you absolutely no resources to actually learn programming.

5388017,0,t3_3oqhye,I didnt have a chance to look at your resume yesterday but I just took a look. I think youre under selling yourself. Im not suggesting you embellish or lie about your experience but from what I see here it looks like you just went to college and only did coursework. You might be thinking Well thats all Ive done. Sure but from your resume I dont get a sense of exactly how much experience you actually have with the technologies listed in your Skills section.I would suggest adding the number of years youve worked with each technology even if its not in a production environment. This will provide an idea of how familiar you are with the products. It will also show that you already have a couple of years experience with those products which is sometimes the low end of their hiring requirements. Id love to hire this guy but we need a BA and  years experience with Windows Server. All he has is a BA. Its kind of silly I know but Ive seen this happen on many occasions. They will hire the guy who listed the years of experience he has over the guy who didnt list them. Keep working on your skills. Build yourself a lab environment and go through your CCNA books. Build out the lab as if it were a production environment. When you do get an interview youll be able to explain to them that you have the knowledge and skills to make things happen and you have taken the initiative to learn them on your own in your own lab. Test your skills in the lab. Try setting up a typical scenario. You will find the common bugs that pop up every system has them. When you interview you can explain how you found out that its not as straight forward as the books explain and you searched and experimented to find the solutions to make it work as intended. Document your findings. MS OneNote is a great tool to use but even a word document would due for now. You can tell the potential employer that youve created documentation on how to install and configure XXX. Youve done test runs using only your documentation and it led to a successful deployment. These are the types of things that make you stand out as a candidate. An employer wants to get the most bang for their buck. Theyre looking at how youve taken the initiative how youve used critical thinking to solve complex problems how your skill set and practice proves you can provide successful results.Keep honing your skills learning new technologies or increasing your knowledge in a niche. Keep working on those certs and try not to get discouraged. In  years when youre approaching a  figure salary you thank yourself for working so hard.Edit words.,ITCareerQuestions,cw0dolf,2,t5_30560

5520222,0,t1_cwh4cls,Lighten up I was making a joke about the typo.Anyways how big is your place?  In my experience the bigger the place the more likely HR is a gatekeeper and the more likely they have these types of requirements.  If HRs job is just to process payroll and run the benefits its much easier to get your resume in front of a manager.  In bigger organizations my first interviews are almost always an HR screen to talk about my resume salary requirements test basic social skills etc.  At that point the hiring managers havent seen my resume and wont if Im not a decent sounding match or meet all of their minimum requirements.  Sometimes job postings Im otherwise qualified for list a requirement masters degree a certification or a keyword I dont have and I never get called at all.  I realize part of the idea is to save managers time not having to review every resume and let HR give them the top  or  or whatever.  And maybe the idea that If this team needs to hire someone they are shortstaffed so their time is better spent doing work instead of reading through every resume.  Also HR needs to justify a reason for them to exist so sometimes its their doing that this screening exists.,ITCareerQuestions,cwh9bbh,1,t5_30560

5624126,0,t1_cwqkdy3,Sorry for the late reply I disconnected myself from technology over the weekend but I am back and synced up and it is attached at my hip once again lol.gt So if you are working on a contract is there something in that contract that legally binds you to that company for the given amount of time?It depends if you sign a contract with the company or the company is having the other company that is requesting work to be contracted sign the paperwork.  So basically the idea is that you might work for a middleman company.  You are a person looking for work middleman company is a contracting company that goes out and offers to find people to fill positions for other companies.  Those companies write up a contract with middleman company with what they need for the position and then middleman company hires you to do the work and is the one that pays you while they are getting paid by the company that has hired them to handle the contract work.In another case it could be that you sign a contract for X amount of time with a direct company as a true contractor.  This has implication because if you are a contract also known as a  you are responsible for handling taxes and all that jazz yourself.  Specifically if you are in the states  can be great and can be awful.  Ive been a  and it sucked hardcore because I never truly got my  paperwork technically illegal so I had to paid estimated taxes for a number of years which caused all kinds of other issues and a whole story that doesnt really fit here.gt Meaning during that job I am not allowed to look for another job and say I find one I cannot quit and go work somewhere else?Generally you are safe depending on the wording in the contract and what binds you if there is a binding contract.  I worked for a company that made me sign a noncompete that said I cannot work for a company in  miles of the companys office.  Considering I was a remote worker many state over and s of miles away and the state I was in laughs at noncompetes it didnt mean shit for me.  Additionally the agreement on that was for  whole year which i think is some utter bullshit especially if you said company fires you without reason  again another story that doesnt fit here other than what I said.gt Does it mean that unless I am fired I am LEGALLY required to work that position for the duration of the contract or else something bad happens?Yes and no  of contracts I seen have a thing in there that says If ltperson namegt is fired for XYZ reasons.... they are no longer legally binded to this contract and it becomes null and void.  However there are some contracts that do make it legally binding that they cannot work in the same field competition or title as they did in the contract even after being fired until a certain amount of time expires which generally is going to be a lowish number.  Additionally this type of contract is normally for high jobs and specialized things holding company trade secrets and other crazy stuff that you probably dont want to deal with just yet .    Again like I mentioned above you may have to sign a noncompete but that could mean jack crap depending on your states law so you might want to verify that I can tell you that California laughs all day long at noncompetes and items like that and my opinion they are absolutely a giant steaming pile of crap and can easily be fought in a court if they have to be.So best advice I can give is that if you have to sign a contract and there is information and wording you do not understand speak to a legal person about the contract and have them review what you are going to get into.  If you have a contract and you want a second opinion on it I am happy to review it but I cannot in any way give legal advise or any other suggestions other than reading it and explaining it in terms of how I read it and what I see.  I HIGHLY recommend before getting into any contract with a company speak to a legal professional.However I think this type of job is just called a contracting job in the sense that the company is looking to hire people as  contracts which means you handle your own taxes but can write off any expenses required for the job during tax seasons one of the reasons why some people love  contracts.  Basically there will be very limited if any binding agreements other than that you will do the work that is assigned to you and that if you wish to leave dont be a jerk and at least give a  or later week notice.  You might have some other paperwork that you agree not to share information about the companys systems etc etc to others and possibly depending on the work take a job from a competitor if the company has a competitor or is like that.  Overall I think youll be fine and I think I might be over analyzing this whole thing coming from my business point of mind.Hope some of this helps feel free to reply if you have more questions or PM Ill be around this week.,ITCareerQuestions,cwu85rp,1,t5_30560

Let me start by saying it is an outstanding career field and it is growing extremely fast.  Okay now that is out of the way I want to share some  common misconceptions.  ampnbsp You have to start your career in a lower level job before you can become a Business Analyst.  This is completely false!  As a hiring manager I of course value people that have been in the role previously but I also value those that can leverage the skills they have gained in school and other random jobs.  You would be surprised at the number of Business Analyst related skills you can pick up working just about anywhere.ampnbsp Technical experience is required.  Again this is false.  Technical aptitude does give some candidates a leg up but is not necessary for all Business Analyst roles.  Understanding what roles a Business Analyst plays will help you to position your competitive advantage over the competition other applicants.ampnbspI go into these topics and more in the ondemand online course that I put together called  Steps to Becoming a Business Analyst.  It just so happens that this is my launch weekend of the course so I am running a special.  Normally the course is . but for the weekend I am running a  off special and pricing the course at ..  I know this will be a tremendous asset to give you some guidance on where to turn and how to break into the field.

Oh and familiarity with linux. It would also be nice if they could troubleshoot via CLI and had experience with Nagios and SolarwindsNow I dont expect all of that. Thats more like a jr engineer or fairly advanced admin not a junior tech. But HR is going to list all of it because I got unfocused and just listed what I was dreaming about in a perfect candidate. Then they toss all of that along with a few years experience and a price tag thats way too low if they list a price tag at all.Dont concern yourself too much with those checklist requirements as long as youre confident you can do the job. Now if you suck and you know it you might want to be in a different field. But otherwise dont worry. Most people dont expect you to meet every requirement.

6456882,0,t1_czmb0xh,I do have an Associate from my first career electronics repair before specifically getting into IT. Not relevant to anything but hey at least Ill be paying for it forever.As far as how easy it is to find Linux people here ..I dont know. The number of people I have EVER met during my career who know anything about Linux I can count on one hand. The Windows tech support folks like me are certainly a dime a dozen but its been very few and far between that I meet anyone I can actually talk Linux with. For most people I feel like Im describing the details of sorcery going way over their heads. This hasnt given me the impression that its a very saturated talent poo. Its one of the reasons I wanted to focus on this so I could have a less generic and more valuable skill set. Maybe there really is an abundance of Linux people in SATX and they just hide like leprechauns. But I do know Ive personally had these recruiters and managers complaining about how hard it is to find people who know Linux. I insist that I do!. And they basically say Yeah thats great but you havent dealt with the kind of scale we need or used expensive enterprise applicationx. We appreciate your enthusiasm but ..meh. Thanks for your time but we want to keep looking.Of course usually I never get any feedback at all but the times I have it always boils down to something like the above. By now the picture has become fairly clear and its rather bleak. I keep trying because what else can I do right? Even I catch a break once in a while.,ITCareerQuestions,czn6nq0,1,t5_30560

6483394,0,t3_44ey7z,Help those who help other people. By this I mean get a job at a nonprofit or a managed service provider who supports nonprofits. I personally hate people but my last job I worked for an MSP that supported a school and library and had plenty of opportunities to make people happy.  Some times it would be a librarian who need computer help to finish a grant application before the deadline other times it would be a student who wanted someone to show them how to use imovie or a teacher who didnt understand google apps. In many cases these people left me in a good and thankful mood.The thing is that in a forprofit corporate environment people tend to be crankier less appreciative and doing less noble work. At the end of the day you are helping jerkbros in finance steal peoples money. So I can see how doing IT support for them doesnt feel satisfying. But the vibe of nonprofits are different.Also dont become a therapist. For one you will need a masters or PhD and two the market is insanely competitive. Plus it can be very depressing work since like  of your clients will never change or will never get out of the shitty situations they are in. If anything support the therapists technology so they can spend a little less time of their day wrestling with computer problems and more of their day seeing patients.,ITCareerQuestions,czpxj3e,1,t5_30560

When you use premise equipment to host your software there is a lot of room for business laziness and inefficiency when it comes to documenting business processes and writing good requirements and designs. When youre paying someone else to host solutions for you that inefficiency gets very expensive. I would not put BAs and DevOPS in the same category or career space. Business analysis development and infrastructure are three distinct things. BAs provide their value up front before software or enhancements to software have even started to be coded. There may be some blurring of roles between development and infrastructure i.e. people who both support infra and code changes but theyre still distinct from business analysis. Thats why youre not seeing many DevOPS BA jobs!If youre looking to be a cutting edge BA in a world moving to cloud then figure out how to do analysis  and requirements gathering in a way that will support cloud. What are the cloud policies that need to be incorporated into requirements? How do you describe non functional requirements like performance reliability scalability? How do you write a solid Service Level Agreement SLA that clearly states what the cloud vendor should be providing you?

Their IT operations are HUGE which provided me the opportunity to learn a LOT about IT. I worked as a recruiter for about  months and did very well.  I really tried to just absorb as much information as possible. I wanted to gain a high level understanding of all the technologies used at the company. I ended up getting promoted to an Account Manager which further helped propel me into IT.  I was now working onsite meeting with the customer to determine their needs flr different projects mainly application dev Big Data and ETL devops datacenter engineering netsec. I got to experience firsthand how an Enterprise IT Ecosystem functions and runs. During this time I would learn more and more about various technologies used at the company and I used this knowledge to make sales. Fast forward to now Im working as a Support AnalystProject Manager at an MSP that designs and deploys remote managed video surveillance systems for clients all over the world.

Lets just say that outside of the actual cyberwarfare and intel areas standards can be pretty lax in the DoD. If you go in with a good attitude a willingness to learn and the ability to accept that certain things will be done in an incredibly stupid way for no discernible reason you will go far.   ,ITCareerQuestions,d3g1414,6,t5_30560

7700489,0,t3_4ksqqn,I dont know how many companies use ITIL but I love it and after years of working at companies with and without ITIL I wouldnt accept a job at a place that didnt use ITIL or something similar.  IT departments without some kind of framework like ITIL are just flying by the seat of their pants and responsibilities are assigned based on which Manager is the able to bully the other Managers the best.   Others will disagree there is always the that is so last year crowd but Ive seen how chaotic things can be without the underlying structure that ITIL can provide if implemented properly.  I have no more patience or faith in a department whose illogical processes and division of labor are based on we dont know why we do it this way its just always been that way.  As an employer Id definitely prefer to see an applicant with at least some ITIL certification.  People without it often have bad habits based on previous job experience.  Ask someone without any ITIL or similar training for suggestions for process improvements and youll usually get At my old job we... followed by a bunch of meaningless nonsense.  No creativity no logic no thinking outside the box  because years of working with a poor set of rules and processes has given them nothing else to go on.  ITIL training doesnt guarantee a good employee any more than a PHD guarantees a good doctor but theres a much higher chance with the cert than without.  ,ITCareerQuestions,d3hhth3,3,t5_30560

It says nothing about retention and ability.Youll definitely lose some otherwise qualified candidates but I wouldnt say all of the certs merely mean that you simply test well.  The tests that actually have practical simulations or better yet lab exams like the CCIE or Alcatels NRS  as opposed to multiple choice questions will tell you a lot more than you merely test well.  The key question is whether the test objectives actually overlap the position you are hiring.  There are some jobs though like DoD contractors that need to meet DoD rules that their hands are pretty much tied because their customer demands it. No test can tell you about how likely you are to retain them and thats not really the goal.  Past length of tenure can give you a hint but ultimately compatibility with company culture will be a big factor upon whether people want to stay or go.gtI have a much bigger problem with certificate mills that charge you  highest Ive seen is  for a  week study seminar at a local hotel do get certified and then who guarantee youll get a highpaying job.Thats simply a crazy amount of money.

But many times there are fundamental people problems that need to be solved first. My maxim is never try to solve a social problem with technology.Sometimes it manifests itself as Corporate never gives IT money so IT cant deliver all these wonderful services which they expect of us. Of course Corporate is thinks We give IT all this money and all they do is complain they need more money for useless upgrades. When are they going to fix our problems?. Neither is right its because you arent communicating.The rift happens when IT people think of their job as technology first. Its not. Its about solving business problems.  When done right its not your job to decide on what to do next add shiny new feature X or upgrade yearsold database Y. You need to understand the Corporate needs and explain the tradeoffs of doing X vs Y. Most of the time it is acceptable to take debt in some areas in order to accelerate others. The business is always doing stuff like this when they EOL a product. It might be that upgrading your DB not cost effective. You have to think like a business and be able to show the ROI. Technology people often throw their feelings into the ROI calculation which isnt helpful.If you partner correctly IT wont be stressful since youre just an arm of the Business.

Except for my wife there arent exactly a lot of people I can tolerate having around me. Im that guy that unfortunately needs to work in a team all day long but hates it like you wouldnt believe. Then every day I go home bearing a headache like an elephant sitting in my neck happy to get home to my solitude with my wife. What I like doing well I like doing stuff with my hands.

IMO Focus on being a full time student for now if at all possible.  Pursue Summer Internships with the rest of the technologydegree herd. Bask in the glory of having real honest experience already on your resume as you apply for those opportunities.  Approach a Summer Internship like a deployment. Tell your wife you are being relocated to Memphis for  months and youll be back soon.Leverage every resource the GI Bill and VA make available to you  you earned those benefits  paid for in blood sweat and blisters.  Big.Army taught you discipline and how to develop a plan and stick to it. Apply those skills and attack your career plan.  . ISITCISMISCompECompSci degree is what you want to look for.    DONT do a Web technologies or Front End Development diploma.    Any Texas State University is just fine.  . Ask the school about coop work with the campus NOC or IT group.    OnCampus jobs tend to be superflexible and can provide limited access to very heavy iron in some cases.  . Locate oncampus Career Services Center.    Sign your happy ass up for every class they have on resume and interview skills.    Attend every kind of class at LEAST once. You probably need those skills more than you think.    Ask about and coordinate your attendance to every single Career Fair on campus all four years.    Practice your interview skills. Talk to recruiters even from companies you dont like.    Put forth your best personal effort to obtain a formal corporate internship every single summer that you can.    That internship might help you skip the Help Desk amp NOC phases of the career path and start you off doing server network or similar real engineering work right out of school.  . You take an elective that teaches you about personal finance and investments or you will regret it.    Intro to Business or Econ isnt enough.    You need to understand how a k works and develop a retirement plan that isnt bullshit muchopronto.  Good luck.  Something something USMC gt Army...  ,ITCareerQuestions,d8omo7g,6,t5_30560

However interviews are where I think I might struggle a bit as selling myself without trying to come off arrogant seems to be a fine balance. I really wish I had gone the computer science or engineering route as it seems those professions are accepting of the eccentric personalities. My experience with the Criminal Justice field has been hardheaded individuals who seemed to take the career path because it was available to them at the time.. Shame I spent  years working my ass off for it to mean almost nothing in the real world.I am currently living in the upper state of South Carolina roughly  minutes from Charlotte NC.  Did you take the job fair route?  If so how did you go about it?  I assume just go and hope for the best? My issue right now is that I spent  years pursuing a degree in the field I thought my future would reside in. Now I feel like Im starting anew and trying to tread carefully to place myself in a position where I can find a decent entry level position or attain some certifications and knowledge to push my future in a positive direction.  Being  and for the second time unknowing of where I am headed career wise is a scary feeling.

10045566,0,t1_dbgwiyn,oh yeah  MSP  managed services provider  I think its a little different in regards to my specific question though theres probably some of similarities between MSP and CC regarding loyalty and conflicts of interest. What Ive noticed different about about corptocorp is  the employee is assigned to one client at a time rather than handling various services for multiple clients  when it comes to CC employees theres virtually no way to reach them without going through their employer. No last names on resumes contact info is firstnamenetworkinggmail.com owned by the parent firm phone number leads to their parent firm as well... even Linkedin profiles are sometimes owned by the parent firm. Ive never had trouble getting in touch with an employee at an MSP  though theyre not always interested p These things that are unique to CC employees is in part what drove my question. When the contact info on an individuals resume tuns out to be the EMPLOYERS and then the employees if I manage to get in touch with them somehow are completely uninterested in discussing a fulltime directhire long term opportunity that they APPLIED for its honestly baffaling. Even with the very detailed explanation above I still suspect theres something else underlying that I dont know yet Doesnt quite make sense that  of the people I speak with pretty much dont exist individually in the virtual space tell me say Im loyal to my employer and mean dont like office politics prefer the stability. ,ITCareerQuestions,dbgyocf,1,t5_30560

10196370,0,t3_5luouz,I love answering this question. Generally hourly is a lot better just for the overtime compensation but let me run a few scenarios for you where other things you may value will outweigh overtime compensation If you work exactly hours a week and your pay rate is the same amount for both salary or hourly lets say kyr salary is better because there tends to be less paperwork than hourly where you may have to handle timecard punching or other various paperwork around it. Overtime compensation wouldnt matter in this scenario since you are working exactly hours a week. Also with salary you wouldnt have to worry about accidentally being paid late or on an offcycle from payroll because you didnt fill out your timecard which happens more often than you might expect. Basically dont underestimate the administrative process and paperwork behind hourly it can be a hassle. If your pay is kyr again but your hours can be streneous and beyond the average hour week hourly may be better suited for you to receive overtime compensation. However there is such a thing called comped time which your team may or may not unofficial practice. if you prefer comped time to overtime and its ok at your place you may like salary still. If your pay is subaverage and your management is ok with allowing you to work overtime hourly is better.Since youre asking this in the IT careers subreddit most IT jobs have the same benefits across the board whether youre salary or hourly. The only time it becomes any different is if youre on a managerial level or exec level.,ITCareerQuestions,dbztcdq,1,t5_30560

Why would you need to know details like setting up DNS amp DHCP? Most of that is already established in an environment and rarely needs to be reconfigured.,ITCareerQuestions,devjv83,3,t5_30560
11148929,0,t1_devp3n1,Oh dont get me wrong. I love watching the sheer panic in peoples eyes when I ask them to define an acronym. The majority of the time I do it as a curveball scenario to see how you handle being pushed out of your comfort zone and think on your feet.One of my common technical scenarios in an interview is to disable wireless and then ask the candidate to tell me why I cant get on the internet. Some people overthink it and start reinstalling drivers. Others just turn on wireless and look confused that it was that easy to resolve.,ITCareerQuestions,devpwaf,3,t5_30560

But if you want to be successful in the field without a degree you better be damn good in your craft that would wow someone in an interview. ,ITCareerQuestions,df1y00z,2,t5_30560
11216432,0,t3_5zuv25,Define industry. IT or what your company does?It sounds like you are getting a very good response from indeed of candidates. Unfortunately this is what you get with entry level roles. A lot of propels changing careers or just finding one. Dont assume that because they have a Master degree they wont accept your salary range. Just skim through a large number of topics on this sub. A lot of people went to college like they were supposed to and got out and realized they may want to do something different. I think your salary level is OK but may be a bit low. This is a blanket statement not knowing your COL for your market. One thing you may want to seriously consider is contracting and do a temp to hire for this position. If you want to PM me and let me know where you are I can probably give you more feedback on this particular topic. ,ITCareerQuestions,df3damx,1,t5_30560

Learn how config profiles work. Learn how to bind it with AD for auth. Learn how to do some basic scripts and configs. Get a demo of jamf and learn the basics of their tools.Every company will be different and expectations of hiring managers will be different but nothing stopping you from getting a basic framework of knowledge from a crappy  mac at home.,ITCareerQuestions,df8gjme,1,t5_30560

Now once you want to more away from being a firefighter degrees can come into play but that is a corp culture deal.
