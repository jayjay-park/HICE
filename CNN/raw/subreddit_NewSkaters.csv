52435,0,t3_1up7z1,If you go to a skate shop they should have a big piece of gum rubber that you can buy which is used for cleaning grip tape. It takes a bit of elbow grease but it works to pull dirt out of grip. Now if youve got mud caked on then more drastic measures would be called forlike a scrub brush and some water. Just try to avoid soaking the board as Im sure water and woodglues dont play well together. And obviously avoid letting the dirtwater find its way into your bearings. Probably best to take off your wheels if youll be doing some major cleaning. ,NewSkaters,cekeept,2,t5_2tqri

241870,0,t3_1wv0hk,Sort of two different issues I think. One is actually getting the board to rotate to where its landable consistently and I think thats just a practicefeelmuscle memory kind of thing. Something you do with your body more than your mind. You can do it sometimes now but it will get more consistent with more practice. The other is landing bolts and I feel thats  mental. If the board is somewhere you can land on it then you can land on it bolts. You just need to believe that and actually make a point of doing it and it will happen. Do a lot of just that hippy jump  land bolts stand next to it and jump on  land bolts run towards it from any angle jump towards it  land bolts. Hippy jump   land bolts is one I had fun trying. Ollie  land bolts. repeat that one xPersonally I leave my front foot very slightly in contact with the middle of the deck at the start of this trick. I think of spinning the board on it like a propeller. I dont know if thats bad form or anything but it works for me. Also this trick can be done with almost zero ollie just get a little light and spin it around. Can pop it more later.,NewSkaters,cf5tldz,2,t5_2tqri

As far as doing ollies in Goofy which will be switch if you make regular your main stance you could still eventually learn them and then you will be able to ollie and switch ollie which will help immensely when you go to learn nollies.

Id say just start doing them rolling tricks have a different momentum while moving and the added forward momentum will help you a lot in getting that proper rotation under your feet and landing bolts I actually think doing flip tricks stationary is a bit harder than doing them moving slowly. ,NewSkaters,cgjf3go,3,t5_2tqri

763506,0,t3_22vx3x,If its working for you then whatever go with it but for general infoThat nut can only do so much. The bushings come in different levels of hardness to match riders of different weights and riding styles. Ideally you want to choose a bushing that produces the feel you want with the nut in a normal flush position.If you have to crank the nut down to get the trucks to the stiffness you want then your bushings are too soft. Especially if theyre starting to deform or squish out of the bushing seat. They wont work great and might not last long like this.If you cant do the nut up much at all before the trucks feel too stiff your bushings are too hard. This leaves the nut sticking up too far where it can catch on grinds. If you do the nut up to a reasonably normal position and the board can make its full depth turns without a huge effort youve got the bushings right.You can usually find Bones bushings at every shop but they only come in three levels of hardness which can be a problem sometimes. If you fall into a gap between their sizing Venom bushings are excellent and come in many more levels of hardness but you may have to cut them to the right length for some trucks.You also have a choice of a barrel bottom or a cone bottom. A cone has an even predictable response. If it took  pounds of pressure to tip the board  degrees  pounds of pressure will tip it  degrees and so on. Barrels have a more progressive response if it took  pounds to tip it  degrees  pounds might tip it  degrees.  pounds might be  degrees etc. ,NewSkaters,cgr2eme,3,t5_2tqri

1663999,0,t3_2degbh,Well skateboarding basically uses loads of muscles that you usually dont use and put a lot of strain on different joints in the body. In your every day life you hardly use your ankle just for waking. Skateboarding requires loads of different motions that your body isnt used to. Give it time the muscles will get stronger and provide extra support so that your body doesnt hurt much anymore. Also youll get better at pushing as time goes by. On rough roads with hard wheels the board vibrates a lot which can cause discomfort or even pain. I personally dont have problems with my ankles it comes more from my knees. My general rule is that is when you stop skating the pain disappear after a week or so then there is nothing wrong. ,NewSkaters,cjowqc4,1,t5_2tqri

Complete packages are generally much cheaper than buying all the parts separately in your cart you get a discount for buying a board as a complete as opposed to picking individual parts and adding the price up.DeckA blank deck will lower the cost a bit as opposed to getting Pro Model or a board with a nice graphic like a MiniLogo they are made in the same factory with the same processes as Powell Skateboards very good blanks or a SkateWarehouse blank wood grain for  bucks cheaper.  Its good to first learn to skate on a normal Ply maple rather than a P or Impact or other technologies since they have a different feel to them than normal boards.  A good deck width to start out on is . which is in the middle of narrow . boards suitable for fast technical flip tricks and wider . boards suitable for cruising pools vert.  With the . you have a nice inbetween size thats pretty much suitable for any style.  If you decide to get into pure street skating or pure vert etc. youll have a better idea on whether you want to stick with the  or move up or down in size depending on your needs.TrucksIdeally you want trucks that are as wide as your deck or a little more narrow but not wider than your deck.  The top truck companies right now are Thunder and Independent Venture Ace and Tensor are all reputable companies as well.  Basically the Thunder will give a quicker sporty turn while Independent are more of a slow carving turn.  Trucks come in a variety of heights which basically means the height of the hanger from the board.  With high trucks youll be a little higher off the ground and have more turning room these are good for cruisingvertpools.  Lows have a bit of a higher stability with flip tricks and have a little less turning room and are more suitable for streetskating.  Regular height trucks are inbetween High and Low.  For the width of your trucks if youre skating an  deck stick with  trucks unless you might want to go down in size on board width in the future then get . trucks.  I dont really expect you to know whether youll want to skate wider or skinnier boards just yet so if I were you Id stick with the  trucks.  They outlast multiple setups so if you ever do need a different size you can always save your old trucks if you ever need them again. WheelsWheels provide contact between you and the pavement.  Wheels have a few different basic specifications durometer and size.  Durometer is the hardness of the wheel.  Wheels use the A scale which goes up to A and the B scale which is basically the same as the A scale minus  points so an B wheel is A or B is A.  As for wheel size larger wheels maintain speed better and roll over crackspebbles easier but are harder to flip with small wheels being the opposite.  I find mm wheels to be my personal favorite since its a good mix of being able to roll over shitty terrain and doing tricks.     Bones STF are B while the Bones SPF are B STF  Street Tech Formula SPF  Skate Park Formula.  These are some of the hardest wheels on the market the STF are basically for smooth concrete parks and skating street.  The SPF are primarily for concrete parks where you might have slick surfaces but I never used them I found the STF to be great for concrete parks as well as parking lots.       Spitfire Formula Four wheels just came out last year and come in A and A.  The A is better for rougher roads and wooden skateparks while the A is good for street skating and concrete parks.  Note that both the Spitfire Formula Four amp Bones STFSPF are higher quality urethane formulas than you would get in the regular Bones s or Spitfire Classics and are more resistant to flat spotting.       Medium hardness wheels around A like OJ Keyframes A are great for just cruising to the store or filming in a concrete park they are silent on concrete havent tested them on masonite yet.  With a medium hardness wheel you can still ollie up curbs and down them without worrying about the wheel squishing out like you would with a softer wheel soft wheels around A can sort of squish on hard impacts making them lose some speed and can throw you off balance.  My personal favorite wheel if Im not going to be doing any heavy skating but still want to pop the occasional ollie over something.     Soft wheels around A are good for straight up cruising like Ricta Clouds A and Bones ATF A.  They are also great for filming street skating since they are virtually silent.  If you dont want to do tricks and just want to roll around town go with these.BearingsBones makes the best bearings on the market and is the most reputable company out there right now you cant really go wrong with buying Bones Reds best bang for your buck or Bones Super Reds I havent ever used them but others have said they last a bit longer than normal Reds.  Once you go through your first set of Reds might take a year or two you can get another set of Reds or shell out for the Bones Swiss pro level bearings a lot of pros use them they are faster and hold speed better.       For bearing maintenance you will need some Isopropyl Alcohol or some type of light CitrusOrange degreaser to clean them once in a great while they will need to be cleaned and relubed I like to do it once a month if possible with Reds and once every few months with Swiss.  GriptapeGrip is mostly the same shit but it varies by the level of grit.  Mob is my personal favorite its very gritty and grips well so you stick more tricks and is very durable.  Note that it can tear your shoes up a bit faster than a less gritty griptape at least for the first month or so of skating until it wears down a bit from heavy skating.  Jessup is another favorite of a lot of people out there its a little less gritty and kind of feels already broken in when you start skating it.  The only thing I dont like is that it wears out quicker baby smooth grip is no fun.  GrizzlyDiamond grip is decent too its kind of in between Mob and Jessup in terms of grittiness.  But Mob is the best for the job at least for me.  Skating is all preference.Hardware  RisersHow you gonna hold all that shit together without nuts and bolts?  Anything  will be fine   if you are skating with risers.  I usually get Phillips because I always lose those little allen wrenches and  point phillips screwdrivers are fairly common in the US.    Risers are optional depending on your truckwheel setup.  They basically go in between the trucks and the deck to give your trucks a little extra heightturn room to prevent wheel bite wheel bite is when your wheel touches your board and stops you dead in your tracks.  If you are riding LowMedium trucks with mm wheels you wont really need risers usually they are only needed with larger wheels.   Tools and Stuff      Get a skate tool.  It will save you a lot of time its much more convenient to pull out a little multitool with everything you need than to pull out a bunch of wrenches and a screwdriver whenever you want to do board maintenance.       Also get a tube of shoe goo.  It will make your shoes last much longer than normal.  Here is a tutorial on how to use it.  Other infoNow that Ive covered all the general skate gear basics it looks like you have some other questions.gtAre the only things you need is a skateboard and skateboard tools?For cruising you will be fine in regular shoes but something flatbottomed will work better than something with an arch.  If you want to get into ollies and other tricks youll need to get a pair of skate shoes.  Suede is much more durable than canvas in terms of how easy it rips usually canvas shoes will rip after the first  ollie attempts and will have a hole in them.  My favorite shoe companies are Adidas Globe and Fallen.  Right now Im skating a pair of Adidas Americana which are basically a lighter version of the Campus Vulc.     With skate shoes you basically have Vulcanized and Cupsole.  Here is a video that shows the difference  You can also order shoes on the websites I mentioned if you dont have any skate shops in your town. gtCould also use some tips on how to trainYouTube is your friend for trick tips and tutorial videos.  One of the better channels is Braille Skateboarding he has a ton of helpful videos.  Check out the Learn to Skateboard Videos playlist it has pretty much everything. ,NewSkaters,ckzrnk5,9,t5_2tqri
2120153,0,t3_2j7f33,I could just replace the bearings and put on some griptape. It would make the board useable but I dont know what the statequality of the deck is.

Youre going to have a hard time keeping up with your friend even just cruising around and youre really killing a lot of cool places to skate.  A normal skateboard can do just about anything a specialized skateboard can do but a penny board is really only good for one kind of riding.

Bigger wheels also have an easier time going over cracks and generally feel smoother.For trucks just make sure they fit your board. You can go wider if you like but not thinner.For bearings get Reds or Zealous and know this the amount of time the wheels spin when you hit them with your hand freespin doesnt matter at all. If anything a short quiet freespin is better than a long loud one since the shorter one will feel smoother.Mix and match brands as much as you like.

Some days Im really comfortable and Ill skate like that as long as I can. Other days Im just feeling the Mongo more.

Id have to see how jacked up the grip tape is to make a proper suggestion but if it still has some grip to it on the majority of the board it should be okAs for tricks cruisers are not made for them.

6952882,0,t3_4awlhm,an easy way to get onto something thats just a little too high for your ollie is to jump onto it and let your back trucks get caught under the edge. but you try to land with your front foot in front of the bolts so you can shift your weight down and let the back wheels ride up and onto the box.Hope that makes sense. Then just do it faster till youre pretty much just doing a plain old ollie onto it. Good practice.When it comes to doing ledge tricks you have to be at the point where youre not even consciously thinking about your ollie it should just be a natural movement so you can put all your focus onto the landing position. REALLY picture yourself  second ahead in time as if you can see yourself landing on the box. This is a great help for me when Im trying to grind something.

I bought it when I was  and I havent grown much since so when I got back into skating I just got back on that board. Im pretty comfortable riding it even if its not considered the ideal size for a grown adult. Youll probably be more comfortable with a . or  board though like ufaceslam said. My SO rides a . which Ive tried out and actually do feel a slight difference. It might be purely psychological or it might be that . really does make a difference. Haha.

7471494,0,t3_4hovol,First you have the stance you normally ride in. Right foot forward is called goofy named for the Disney character goofy and left foot forward is boringly called regular.Switch stance literally means switching from the one you normally ride in to the other one. So if you ride goofy normally but you start riding regular for a minute youre riding switch.Fakie is when you stay in your normal stance but start rolling backwards. So imagine if you rode up a little slope and you stopped and started to roll back down the way you came thats fakie.Nollie is what we call doing tricks off the front of your board when youre rolling the normal way.,NewSkaters,d2rgpui,5,t5_2tqri

8218291,0,t3_4rvr0v,Pad up and do your thang. Nobody cares if you wear pads. Youre not trying to impress anyone.If youre at the skatepark ask people for help with tricks. Youll be surprised how nice people are. Ive gotten tips from  yo kids.Ease in slowly. You want to ride the line between fun and improvement. Work your way up in gradients no matter what you are doing. Want to learn to drop in? Drop in on a degree flat ramp until its no big deal. Dont move up to something biggersteeper until you have it mastered. Its normal for it to take a loooong time to feel comfortable. Be ok with this.Do things with some speed. This is counterintuitive. If you are stationary or barely moving guess what happens when you fall? Youll go straight to the ground and probably get hurt. It feels scary to ride with a little speed but when you fall your forward momentum will help you roll out and absorb the impact. Practice riding into some grass and bailing both rolling and running out.,NewSkaters,d54ubpp,1,t5_2tqri
8222037,0,t1_d559225,I was saying to buy the extra wheels when you wanted to do tricks getting the softer wheels with the custom complete.Softer wheels on a regular skateboard are just fine for cruising not really a makeshift option check out this demo of some guys riding on Ricta Clouds.The length of the board and the wheelbase just effect the turn radius so with a  skateboard you have a sharper turn useful for city commuting navigating around people and potholes etc. whereas with a longboard you have a larger turn radius more of a drawn out arc.I think in your situation since you plan on doing tricks later on youll be best off with a skateboard with soft wheels aa so when you feel comfortable enough you can buy a secondary set of wheelsbearings and ease into tricks etc.Personally I wouldnt mind buying a landyachtz dinghy just to have a nice little cruiser in my quiver since Im always swapping parts on one board usually and itd be nice to have a designated cruiser board.

8987538,0,t1_d7s44d0,Even for tricks unless youre the size of a  year old boy or smaller this isnt what you want. The average size for doing tricks is .  .. If youre under the impression that getting a tiny board will make it easier for you to learn flip tricks forget that its a myth. The difficult thing about doing flip tricks is control not strength. Anyone is strong enough to make any size flip way too much. What you need is a size thats a good match for how you naturally move so you get the right amount of feedback to actually feel what its doing and control it the best. When you watch people doing all those flip tricks on street league or in videos theyre not riding a little board like this. . is about average on there but guys are riding up to . and still flipping it like crazy.,NewSkaters,d7s5wua,1,t5_2tqri

10614553,0,t3_5rohou,People are going to gravitate towards more well known brands obviously because more people have skated them and can attest to their quality. Each company has different formulas that they cast their wheels in and those formulas will behave differently under certain conditions.For example some wheels are more prone to flat spotting OJ Keyframes than others which were designed with sliding in mind PP GSlides. Overall it doesnt matter too much what brand you get if you want a general wheel especially in higher durometers. Urethane formula doesnt matter with street skating as much as it does with longboarding IMO where the characteristics are very important in how you will perform when going downhill at high speeds Ex slow or fast release more aggressive hookup when coming out of slides etc.. Really you should try and buy from different brands and kinds of wheels to find out what you like and what works for you you may find some of these minute differences to be preferable or something you dont like as much as another kind.,NewSkaters,ddat7b2,2,t5_2tqri

Even if you are on crappyrough cement Id still try to find something somewhere around A or so any softer and it just gets too gummy and slow unless you have huge longboard wheels.,NewSkaters,ddzqga0,4,t5_2tqri
10865979,0,t3_5v7upw,Ive been skating Ricta Cloud a Im thinking about going for a harder wheel for about  months now on my bumpy ass English roads and these are for sure my favourite wheels. They really are the best of both worlds I can cruise smoothly and quietly which is great but I can still have a decent trick sessions with them. Id definetly reccomend these wheels to an begginner street skater out there.,NewSkaters,de0qykm,2,t5_2tqri

11092340,0,t3_5ydlie,Youre not centered over the board. If you were centered above it it would stay directly beneath you.The other part about flipping above your feet just means you arent jumpingcommiting to it rather doing the only doing the motion.If you have commitment problems try to land a few upside down like only do a half kickflips.

11204490,0,t1_df202g7,Issues as far as setting up your board? Yeah they should be able to help. In my area a running joke is that zumiez staff dont skate so dont let them set up the board haha. If its something your worried about i believe you can choose to have your board assembled by SW. If anything maybe just have them grip your deck. The other stuff is super easy and this sub seems pretty good about answering beginner questions without being douchey,NewSkaters,df20jea,5,t5_2tqri

11526021,0,t3_64iztl,Hey guys. Im seeing a lot of people struggling with the basics and I see that most problems are no pop at all no kicking with front foot not lifting back foot after the popI was recording myself trying some heelflips  Just missing the landing but DAMN it is hard at first and was warming up with some ollies. And I thought that it is possible in this little slowmo video to see the exactly moment you need to jump and raise your back feet after the pop as this seems to be one of the major issues people here are having.Hope it helps someone!
