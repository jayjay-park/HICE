7518134,0,t1_d2wrjdf,gt Reddit whats the most badass thing youve ever done?When I was in scouting I went to the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. That alone should tell you something if you know what it is for those who dont its hundreds of miles in the backcountry of New Mexico with tons of cool shit. I hiked  miles over  days doing a ton of badass shit. However the most badass thing I did was climbing Mt. Baldy. I was literally on top of the world when I stood on the peak.,the_donaldSuperstars,d2wrwgd,1,t5_3eie9
