843602,0,t1_ch01g49,I dont think it benefits you for me to ignore your statements about having been brought to Truth having awakened and having lost your ego.  Do you believe that you have reached the ultimate state of awakening?  That there is not another level?  Do you know if there is another state beyond your state?  Do you still have an ego?  Is there another level of egolessness beyond what you are?,cosmicclubhouse,ch065th,1,t5_31g37
