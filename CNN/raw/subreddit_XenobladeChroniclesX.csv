5920853,0,t3_3wexbc,This is exactly what I needed thank you! Just finished the story yesterday and aside from gettin the  skell I was a bit lost on what next to do.I do have a question. I have a weaker phoenix and g buster whats the best place to go to get class exp done?Edit durr the joker is surrounded by a hundred ez level  bugs that will do.,XenobladeChroniclesX,cxvr749,1,t5_32886

5989375,0,t1_cy4j04k,I just just checked and youre right they unlock the lvl  versions after the ch then lvl  versions can be found in lvl mechanical treasures and I think the lvl  versions come from affinity missions.You can create or buy a set of gear to augment with EXP Boosts to make grinding go faster.Ive focused on Saltat more then Grex and other mobs they seem to give more EXP.As a mastermind Im doing lots of Brainjack gt Soul Sacrifice to one shot mobs and end battles quickly for leveling.There are videos out there right now that show different grinding spots heres one with repeating fast travel to FN Site  and killing the rebel around the corner  ,XenobladeChroniclesX,cy4ql2t,1,t5_32886
6024370,0,t1_cy8zv5k,How long should the average fast travel take? I feel like its still a bit slow and might not have downloaded or installed properly thanks to shit Internet. ,XenobladeChroniclesX,cy9bfgd,1,t5_32886

6075348,0,t3_3yqnbb,Of course! The game provides plenty of classes that can feel different during stroy mode but most people end up going to the known OP combo as soon as they can after story endsId reccomend Astral Crusader I spent most of my story run as itA very rangedoriented class meant on buffing up your ranged class. I will honestly say that it was a bit less exciting to play than th eother classes I had tried though but i still enjoyed being rangedonly,XenobladeChroniclesX,cyfypkj,1,t5_32886
6075458,0,t1_cyfyxla,Ive been avoiding affinity missions because Ive heard since you have to finish them once you start them and theyre often really hard to finish doing them is just a nuisance. What do they give me? I never did them in the original Xenoblade because it always said I couldnt.,XenobladeChroniclesX,cyfz85v,1,t5_32886

6147863,0,t3_3zre17,Ive done that one but cant remember the specifics... I do know that many times throughout the game the marker on the map sometimes means a level above or below where I was standing. A few times I just ran around the general area and eventually a video for the mission is triggered.,XenobladeChroniclesX,cyog4ma,2,t5_32886
6188964,0,t1_cyszh6o,Yeah the Gamepad is actually useful in Xenoblade but not annoying. You arent use it for any combat related tasks thank goodness. Xenoblade is the first game Ive played that I thought the gamepad actually added to the game experience.,XenobladeChroniclesX,cyt4c60,1,t5_32886
6226201,0,t1_cytq3m0,As far as the monsters that are over your level you just have to look in different places.  This game world as you know is massive so it may be on the other side of the world.  Also size matters a lot in this game so the advice to find creatures that are over your level but smaller than you is interchangeable with monsters that are maybe a few levels under you but a lot larger.  It really just depends.  I will say that after you get a skell after Chapter  it gets really easy to grind certain enemies.  I found an enemy that was literally  levels above that I was able to kill easily in the skells and got from level  to  relatively fast under a couple hours,XenobladeChroniclesX,cyxcnqj,1,t5_32886
6282316,0,t3_41cnes,Learning to sneak around enemies that will absolutely destroy you if combated is an absolutely crucial skill to have. There is a quest later where you literally have to sneak into an enemy base that is teeming with level ish enemies so figure out what you can do now cause it WILL be required later. Btw enemies with a red eye are for some reason super nearsighted so you actually have to get pretty darn close to trigger the battle.,XenobladeChroniclesX,cz3q8uo,1,t5_32886

7199561,0,t3_4e2n5d,Ya know I had that same feeling when I started using the wiki for stuff in Xenoblade on the Wii. The fans are doing amazing work with getting info easily available for both Xenoblade games.,XenobladeChroniclesX,d1wj5ze,3,t5_32886

9803417,0,t1_dait8nz,Thats true but I was saying that Id like a sequel only because I know that we wont be getting the same type of game in the sequel i.e. open world and the Wii U sold terribly. I feel bad for it because it was such a good game yet not many played it and now that the new game wont be the same unlike GTA Fallout Uncharted which generally have the same format with a few exceptions XCX and all it was so good for will be history. ,XenobladeChroniclesX,dalhd7o,1,t5_32886
10713471,0,t3_5t8357,Im a big story driven guy but the gameplay here ended up making up for it. Just running around and seeing what was in this world was rewarding. I didnt go too deep but did try and knock out a good number of affinity missions since they provided more story lines and took  hrs. ,XenobladeChroniclesX,ddl0j71,2,t5_32886
