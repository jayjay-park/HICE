3650509,0,t1_cq8bmlg,Hai I know this. I want to know if this means I wont be able to read it online anymore like on MangaHere.com. I saw a few people saying something regarding the length it was taking for the scandalators to translate the manga and the fact that the manga has been licensed. Because even though I can read some Japanese now its not at manga reading level yet.,DanMachi,cq8dvc7,1,t5_35o71
4136841,0,t1_crrqt8j,gt you didnt want any NPC Gods. Since in most of the writing is slanted at player controlled Gods over their Familias.Yea this is Outdated as I added earlier I changed alot which will be edited in the next upcoming days.gt Also if you keep the one Dungeon Town world focus as it is in the anime might it be possible to leave code in for characters to move between multiple worlds?Adding new Towns would be no issue or even multiple different Towers in different Towns coding wise or even new Spawns etc.gt If the game takes off also sell a server software packagelicense. Like the World Seeds from SAO. To let others operate severs for other connectable worlds?Server software packagelicense will be bought off a rd company anyway theres no point in writing one yourself since it consumes too much time optimizing it and they are rather cheap. Thats what other MMOs do aswell so yea I dont see a point in putting time into an own server code.But I would do that once the game really hits on the market and is a success on kickstarter or anything similar.gt To let others operate severs for other connectable worlds?Interchangeable connectivity is a huge problem between servers.Might fuck up alot of stuff so better off just creating your own servers with other worlds which can then operate without problems.There will definitely be different Towns and Towers if the game is a success but for a base game One Tower and One City is more than enough.,DanMachi,crrthep,1,t5_35o71

4590028,0,t3_3bv00m,Actually it is out you just arent looking in the right place. Here Hopefully its what youre looking for. I think this is what came out with one of the bluray volumes  so its not the full version. Usually they release the soundtrack in several parts as bonus discs with the bluray special editions so youll have to wait for the rest of it. It probably wont get any other kind of official soundtrack. This website is the place to get it though.,DanMachi,ct963iz,1,t5_35o71

7102036,0,t3_4cild7,The inner thoughts persist throughout all of them its just how they are written. They are written from Bells perspective so the monologue is to be expected. Personally I feel that it helps the story in the long run as the novels go on but that isnt absolute seeing as its just my opinion. Hope you can enjoy them as you get used to the writing style,DanMachi,d1ldziw,3,t5_35o71

10119457,0,t1_dbqibex,I think perhaps OP meant something akin to the physical body and not the Status and the stat points.Right now Ottar the minotaur dude is the highest in all of orario. Not much of a spoiler because the author just drops it in the story to make a point of him being strong  doesnt spoil much.This is where the real spoiler speculation is. RN Ottar is in the freya familia  the strongest familia too. However the fact remains that Zeus familia was once the strongest. Aiz could perhaps be chasing after an adventurer whose level far exceeded Ottar. SN zeus familia was wiped out trying to attempt the grand quest so I dont know a lot.sBack to your question  we dont know much really. But Im definitely sure no one is near a level cap yet.,DanMachi,dbqkmka,3,t5_35o71
11668711,0,t1_dgfr2lj,That was by far my favorite chapter I think and Id been shipping them since Welf first appeared. Im super intrigued about the monster girl that appeared at the end though as well as if Syr is Freyas daughter or Freya herself.,DanMachi,dginwy2,6,t5_35o71

11736110,0,t3_67e2bb,Rank S is actually the highest. Bell is just broken so he is able to do it stupid fast. I mean Aiz spent  years at level  and only got one stat to Rank S and it was just at the cusp. ,DanMachi,dgqbg5h,1,t5_35o71
11762112,0,t1_dginwy2,I was so convinced Syr was Freya but that scene threw me for a loop. Now I guess well just have to see how theyre related. ,DanMachi,dgt9jnu,2,t5_35o71
11770416,0,t1_dgu69xq,Violence is expected in anime. Running from brothel to brothel as large amazonian women want to devour you which is still not determined if its a spiritual thing or a sexual thing because of wording and translation and a larger woman wants to consume you and then talking about sex and aphrodisiacs and shoving jugs of aphrodisiacs down people and then of course just the general fact that theyre intending to rape him...,DanMachi,dgu7hqk,1,t5_35o71
11787906,0,t3_686zj2, Nine Hells Three abilities with different effects based on chant focus also capable of chanting while fighting. Thousand Elf A type of ring which can choose between different abilities based on the chant. Not entirely sure how it works. Perseus Enigma also shared by FelsThose are the three I know. Lets see... Bell Liaris Freese Argonaut Luck Firebolt but according to volume  he is capable of creating his own skills so thats why every ability of his is based on that. If he ever receives another ability spell or development ability outside of the Abnormal Resistance he got I cant imagine it not being another rare one. Haruhime Level Boost Welf Crozzo Cursed Blood Crozzo Blood enables creation of magic swords that can be better than their original spellAdditionally Finn is said to have Chain Attack but theres no real indication what that is. Ais is also the only one Ive seen with Swordsmen again no idea.It seems highly likely that Otarr has a rare ability given hes the only level .Im not sure who else it could be.,DanMachi,dgw75p0,1,t5_35o71
