8852569,0,t1_d7bnivo,I thought the same thing. My autistic kid rocks like this too though not as much since shes gotten older. Clothes can be uncomfortable for sensory reasons which could explain his lack thereof. Hes probably just chillin comfortably and enjoying the music. He looked pretty willing to join them too. Those girls are shitty to just leave him and keep going. Motor delays and disabilities can make it difficult for many autistic kids to get useful exercise. They do need to get him on the right track though or that poor kid is going to have health issues that are going to compound his disability. ,holdmyjuicebox,d7byc0r,7,t5_2zxz6
