318564,0,t1_cfdp69u,Most people are only interested in arguing with me and telling me Im wrong Im glad I finally found someone sensible who is willing to learn. You are right about one thing all the other religions are untrue. Mine however is not. I worship the one true God. The God that saved us all.A long time ago the Loptyr Empire ruled over the continent of Jugdral. They were an evil empire who commited many atrocities. They slaughtered millions of people and sacrifised innocent children to their dark God Loptyr. Many people tried to rebel but they were all crushed by the evil empire. Until one day. The day of the Miracle. We call it the Miracle of Forseti.The Wind God Forseti couldnt stand by and let the empire murder any more innocent people. So he came down from Heaven and crushed the empire. He also killed the dark God Loptyr. Then he created a tome and gave it to a great man named Sety. Sety was entrusted with protecting the world through Forsetis powers. He founded his own country Silesse the country where I come from. The tome was used by his descendents in many wars. It is one of the most powerful tomes in the world. The only one that is truly more powerful is the one I use Zephyr. And that is why I win all my fights. Because I have the greatest tome and because I believe in the one true God.I hope you now understand how great Forseti is and that you will start worshipping him with me. If youd like I could take you to Silesse sometime and teach you more about our country and origins. When you are truly Forsetis loyal servant you will see how amazing your life will become.,ColosseumTournament,cfdse32,1,t5_2ywuc
