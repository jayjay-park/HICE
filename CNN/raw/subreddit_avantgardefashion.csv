6506387,0,t3_44frr0,I think Id probably have to say my Naked amp Famous Red Cores. Not mine but here is an article outlining the fading. Basically the white you get from faded jeans is due to the threads not being dyed indigo all the way. These jeans are dyed red all the way then indigo so the fades are red on a dark jean. ,avantgardefashion,czsb5gw,2,t5_3aryr
6537410,0,t3_456czk,so this came up as a comment in a waywt thread earlier.honestly nobody here dresses in avant garde clothes. any designer who is commercially successful and established isnt by definition avant garde. i wouldnt be able to name anyone doing avant garde work now.carol christian poell and deepti barth are helmut lang offspring riffing off almost a quarter of a century old ideas.rick owens boris bidjan saberi julius have been around for similar amounts of time and are commercially successful to the point where their stuff is trickling downa sign that they are accepted by the establishment and therefore not avant garde anymore.lumen et umbra individual sentiments m.a label under construction layer et al are all rehashing maurizio altieris now  year old projectcarpe diem.rei kawakubo issey miyake yohji yamamoto all in the business for decades and decades... can you call a  yr old project avant garde? has the world not changed at all in half a century?the antwerp six is done... margiela demeulemeesterpaul harnden geoffrey b. small with their luddite idiosyncrasies would seem more of a rear garde if anything. though the work of gbs cannot be dismissed so swiftly for it has a much wider range than perhaps anyone else on this list.certainly alexander mcqueen and helmut lang were avant garde in their time. and certainly runway rick and runway thom browne are avantgarde and iris van herpen though sadly she doesnt do menswear. but its precisely the stuff that doesnt get picked by the stores the stuff you never see on the streets only after it trickles down a decade later.so whowhat is avant garde? maybe some recent royal academy designers are avant garde. their first collections will be forever lost and unknown to the greater world. if they are successful they will be absorbed into the fashion machinery and lose by definition any avant garde edge they couldve had. maybe some emerging designer we havent heard of because were not fashion world insiders.so to be clear avant garde here doesnt mean wearing the unthinkable and unwearable. avant garde here is at worst an impossible aspiration to wear clothes that veer on being art ahead of their time outside the establishment and at best an attitude based on an educated and sophisticated desire for the new for non conformity and against conservatism needless to say.,avantgardefashion,czvirky,26,t5_3aryr

7594414,0,t3_4j9e2s,I may be part of the problem not posting fits or encouraging discussion but I have some thoughts I suppose.The description of the sub is very intriguing from a democraticpopulistegalitarian sense that is imo a crucial part of fostering a truly avant garde community  but I for one feel a little bit intimidated by the avant garde aesthetic pressure. This is maybe a personal problem but theres a catch  I think the avant garde slant of the sub makes me feel like maybe my shit is too basic or at least more appropriate for mfmfa but the lack of participation here makes more advanced folx keep to their regular haunts. I dont know if Im alone in the intimidation factor but I think thats maybe the nature of the avant garde in general trying to carve out a space for the avant garde is maybe not alienating but is definitely nebulous and daunting if not only by the deliberate obscurity and undefined aesthetic milieu of what constitutes avant garde fashion. I really appreciate the nonsartorial ACDs in theory but I guess that as a lurker I would look to them as ways of getting to know peoples broader aesthetic preferences beneath their fits. Just by the nature of the internet and AGFs place amidst the fas and rmfs and all that this is going to be somewhere that people go after clothes.Im maybe getting a bit off track and rambling Im also aware that Im not offering any solutions to the lack of activity here. I wouldnt know where to start with this but something thats lacking in other fashion forums I lurk is frank theoretical and conceptual discussion of aesthetic ideation and process. I think that AGF could be a place where theoretical aesthetic principles are developed and debated whether that is through users narrativizing their sartorial taste in the context of their greater artisticcultural personas and tastes or through a more traditional talk shit  post fit model in an aesthetic arena that is just more experimental . I mean thats what the ACDs are about right? Perhaps Im unfairly granting primacy to the sartorial but I think that primacy is going to be hard to break because the internet.I think it would be great to have official or curated content from mods that are not only ACDS and generals and WYWTs etc. What if the sub asked a writer from a sister siteblog to post a few paragraphs on their idea of what AGF means to them? Or even a consistent contributor of mf fma etc? I think that paradoxically AGF could garner more participation by delineating the barriers that constitute Avant Garde  how do we foster a community and a culture purely around the margins and front lines of experimental aesthetics? Discussion and participation here demystifies the avant garde and brings more people into it thus pushing it out further. Thats a big part of what makes this place so tough.,avantgardefashion,d35g38g,6,t5_3aryr
