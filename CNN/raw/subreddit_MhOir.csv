You claim youre changing the constitution but youve only mentioned a referendum on marriage equality.Youve essentially said I dont like this constitution it doesnt suit me well enough. Lets make a new one completely! That way we can put in anything we want and no one can do anything about it.Youre acting like a tyrant.

5051227,0,t1_cuuuin5,Except half of Fine Gael was already in the MHOC Conservatives including yourself who was a minister or something as well as FG leader. So you had instant access to those most likely to vote but the other parties couldnt get in since those subs were private. Regardless of the reasons it ended up being a big conservative brigade so the fact that Labour went completely back on their own principles and election manifesto didnt matter since the next election wouldve just been brigaded again.,MhOir,cuuv4jn,1,t5_35twi

7314054,0,t1_d27lsk3,I believe we are the most successful government in the history of rMHOir we have produced more legislation than any previous government. We are able to implement our programme freely due to our majority of seats we need not pander to the opposition or to coalition partners. I fear our government is a great success and I will continue to introduce legislation and make changes to Ireland for the better. I feel that the opposition are performing poorly they havent tried to introduce any legislation and have performed poorly. Clearly the election results show a rejection of the AAA and an embrace for the Conservative Party. Your own party has been quite inactive and I feel unnecessary I feel we are already very close ideologically and that we would be best as a United party. Deputy AlmightyWibble has opposed our measures as expected he has been active in the comments of Bills and I am glad of it. However I would like the opposition to begin introducing legislation we are reasonable and I am sure we can find common ground. ,MhOir,d29k3v1,2,t5_35twi

8081820,0,t1_d4o0ltn,I would definitely rule out ever going in to a coalition with the Conservatives. I feel that their policies are incompatible with my views and the ULs views on nearly all issues. I do feel that if the UL is in the position to form a government with Fine Gael it should. This country needs change after a term of Conservative majority rule. If the Conservatives take a less extreme stance on issues I would consider being in government with that party.,MhOir,d4ogz6q,3,t5_35twi
8083278,0,t1_d4oggwo,Well firstly Id note that suicide is never the answer to ones problems. There  are mental health issues in particular among the youth and its our governments commitment to ensure that young people have the best opportunities available to them and that they  can have a meaningful and positive youth. Education is the prime way of engaging the youth and our education plan shall provide a modern childcentred Irish education for children. The youth  shall also learn about  philosophy and develop a spiritual relationship with God which will hopefully last their whole lives a faith in God is a powerful thing and can help people overcome their problems. Once a young person has completed education they should be given the opportunity to access third level education or to go into the  workforce our nationalist fiscal policies shall ensure that there are jobs and opportunities for the young Irish people graduating from school yearly.,MhOir,d4omuzr,2,t5_35twi

9166787,0,t3_55v6qu,Mr SpeakerI rise today as a member of the public to oppose this bill. The Irish language is dead and with it most of the Irish culture. My queen successfully planted Ulster and her subjects are very loyal to her in the Queens sovereign territory of Northern Ireland.

10689038,0,t1_ddieupx,Ceann ComhairleWhat rubbish! You outsource health care welfare and rights when you invoke the freedom to travel. The freedom to shove off because Ireland cant deal. The freedom to seek Her Majestys hospitals. If you would like to present the studies of how planned parenting harms overcrowded corridors I am listening. If you would like to tell me about how the scared teen in Sligo is getting no more inconvenience than a half hour flight to anywhere but Ireland I am dead keen to hear about how you have the true telling and I have the horrific hypocrisy.You are right that we have a fundamental disagreement on the urgency of the issue. For me there is an urgent need to change. For you there is an urgent need not to. You are not subtle or moderate. You accuse me of being appalling and horrific. You say I need to check myself. You cast our daughters out and you hide behind sick beds. You hide in crowded hospital corridors which became so under your watch. You fight this fundamental improvement in health care after offering a broken system and you dare to reduce sexuality to she shouldve known better.,MhOir,ddihug0,1,t5_35twi
