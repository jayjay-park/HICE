4905876,0,t1_cuanr5p,I love this series! I didnt expect much from it but it was amazing! Ive finished the first two books still waiting for the right time to read the third I have to get it in from my local library. What did you like about the first book? I really loved the main characters especially the scene where Ruby broke down into tears when she found out that Chubs and Liam werent going to leave her behind because she was a Orange. I know its not a happy scene but I found it to be really powerful.spoiler,TeensBookClub,cucx832,2,t5_399zm
