3869111,0,t1_cqx5jyx,Hi ArixThanks for posting   Just to clarfiy point  I dont mean to allow users to drag in only the IF and not the Otherwise and End IF agreed that would be a nightmare D.   I meant once youve placed an IF it would be great to be able to independently move the Otherwise and End down to enclose existing code rather than the current method which is to drag any existing code and there can be quite a lot up.For example you have this existing codeListChange CaseSet VariableURLGet ContentsGet TextGet DictionarySet VariableGet Value for keySet VariableNow lets say you want to insert an IF statement at the top IfOtherwiseEnd IfListChange CaseSet VariableURLGet ContentsGet TextGet DictionarySet VariableGet Value for keySet VariableRight now youd have to individually drag each element up into the correct place.   What Im suggesting is that you simply drag End If down to the bottom and Otherwise down to where you want it.I suppose another alternative could be to add the ability to mark sections of code then you could drag everything you want in one go.  Kind of like a ctrlshift I suppose.,workflow,cqxb90f,1,t5_2xw1h

I managed to get it installed on my iPhone and record the network traffic which brought me to the next problem. I have to sign in with my cable provider which I cant since Im no US citizen. So what I could get is an URL that might refer to the video content.Id like you to check if you get an Access denied or if you get the video if you follow this link If you like a more detailed technical answer The official NBC app makes this API call when you tap on Shows gt TODAY    curl H Host api.nbc.com H xparkrequestor nbcAppIos H Accept applicationvnd.apijson extparkderivatives H UserAgent NBC CFNetwork. Darwin.. H AcceptLanguage dede compressed If you look at the response the above URL stands out as the mediaURL. Since the domain theplatform.com is also used as the mediaURL in my Nightly News Workflow Im pretty sure it links to the video. What I cant figure out is where exactly my access is blocked when I open it.So you have two options. Tapping the link already works without restrictions for you then I can create your workflow without problems.. You also get no access then you could record your own network traffic of the app after logging in with your cable provider. With this you might be able to find the correct media URL by yourself.,workflow,de29m81,2,t5_2xw1h
