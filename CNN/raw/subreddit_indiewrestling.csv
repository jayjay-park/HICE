4883719,0,t1_cua4h4c,Crazy Mary Dobson and Allysin Kay is so good which makes excited for the Shine iPPV. Mary Scurll wont be underrated after BOLA. I think Chase Owens gets a bad rap because he doesnt fit well in NJPW. Rey Horus needs to get into PWG ASAP and Im surprised he isnt in AAA since he works a lot of those AAA Crash shows and the Rey Misterio sr connection since he was a el Hijo del Rey Misterio ,indiewrestling,cua4q2w,2,t5_39l25

6015724,0,t1_cy826ip,I was only at OVW a week same with WLW and the ROH camps I had an invite back for tv at any time from Danny Davis though but the travel from Mass was a bitch and I was in the middle of planning my wedding. Its mostly all of my notes tips thoughts the layout and discription on how to promo how to carry in and build a ring the proper way so that the boards go right in and onto the ring.I described all the different basic bumps went through move by move on how to do an international from there laid out what should be taught in what order as its not meant to be used to train yourself but rather as a ciricumlum with a reputable trainer as every school Ive ever stopped to train at with the exceptions of Chaotic in Mass ROH OVW and Harleys Place seem to be just haphazardly put together with no real reasoning behind it.Thats why there is a disclaimer in the back stating that everything in it should be done with a good trainer be it the warm up excersies blow up drills bumps spots or whatever else. I also included a story about the time I got stabbed in a Friday but still made it too the ROHKevin Kelly seminar that friday.,indiewrestling,cy86sax,1,t5_39l25
