2361626,0,t3_2m84ww,In Muhan dojeon only Myunsoo is capable of dark comedy. Since he is a national tv gagman many elements of dark comedy must be left out He does an excellent job at making cleaner dark comedy ie. tolerable taboo subjets. Myunsoo will joke about taboo subjets which gives anxiety to the viewers and they become uncomfortable with Myungsoos words. But most of his fans get a small amount of anxiety which result in a bigger laugh the liberated anxiety give extra energy to the laugh. Unfortunately some people will be offended by his words but we need to understand that comedy should not be taken seriously. For example when they visited Seo Taijis house Myungsoo said ya Tae Ji open up! Tae ji make me ramen Lower your eyes. These are considered rude manners but Jaesuk was there to take care of being nice.Myunsoo always has to lean on Jaesuk because dark comedy is highriskhighreward Jaesuk needs to take care of things if someone gets mad at Myunsoo. For example Jaesuk needed to go to the bathroom Myung soo said Ill go with you.... I cant take of this show on my own.. Otherwise if he is by himself we will get angry then apologize like he is giving flyers.In Muhan dojeon I believe that that Myungsoo and Jeong Junha are the main comedians.,koreanvariety,cm3lvq1,3,t5_2wv54

4792621,0,t3_3gdwpf,Complain about stripping and RM plays games about putting clothes on?  E seems to lose steam from the get go so much so the ending comes out doubly redundant.  Once because it isnt the actual ending implicit railroad outcome and once because it isnt the actual ending explicit notreal ending.  The payoff comes off as weak see Es fiery last seconds for contrast.  Elsewise game  makes for an inverted example of why professional competitions are mostly twoway contests i.e. impasse vs. politicking.    People like to talk about RM quality but what about context? How does this episode fare compared to say E Thieves Part  KSH?  It must say something that Family Outing could make boiling water interesting but RM cant do the same with melting ice.

5035987,0,t3_3jv8wj,I can say after Ep.  which was the first time RMs rating dropped below  digit first time in two years. Since then they took out nametagseliminations most of their episodes and instead placed their priority on minigames for  of the broadcast time. Its the same old get hyped about guests play  minigames for hints and check those hints to match stuffs for like  minutes of the final game.One thing many of the people complain is repetitiveness and childishness of show. Although it did get better recently episodes from  to  are just recycling same old minigames again and again Dodgeball mudfields pressure mats being their favorite. And the staff seems to be very obsessed about body gagsslapstick from the members than actually playing games. These body gags are fun if it comes out naturally and from time to time not like now when everyone are trying to do those for attention and resort to such childish gags such as stripping.Add these changes to what viewers already complained about the show being disruptive to watch guest dependent and provides no meanings to the people. What happened after Ep.  although some of those signs began since after Ep.  only got their existing weaknesses much worse. What they should have done instead is strengthen their most powerful and unique points which are member interactions new characters and only at RM games such as hideandseek and nametag eliminations.,koreanvariety,cut10k4,3,t5_2wv54

Though as if real life the teachers ruin all the fun.  Is a toe curling romance side drama the missing ingredient to RM all these years?  For that matter is it mercy or malice that random kimbap is kept in favor of real games played?  Tragic ending then to what was a promising opening.    People like to talk about RM quality but what about context? How does this episode fare compared to say E CJW Part ?

I did find him a tad annoying when he guested on RM but I understood that was just a character for him. He has a lot of potential but I think hes just an all around more sensitive guy who takes criticism to heart. I dont want to speculate without knowing his entire situation but it seems from the IC episodes that hes going through a lot of anxiety because of all of the netizens and antis that he has. It really seems like he has a lot of the symptoms of General Anxiety Disorder this coming from someone who has GAD and has a background in neuroscience. GAD can be super debilitating and it can certainly prevent someone from fully integrating into their roles. I hope that Kwanghee can get over his fears soon and show his true potential. Hes certainly trying hard enough.,koreanvariety,d263oo0,5,t5_2wv54

ND got a lot more fun after Donggu joined  Hes likeable and although hes a newbie at variety hes natural at it  I never thought he actually practices ping pong Donggu fighting.   Donggu is a unique character  Hes kind positive and works hard at everything  Sometimes its so funny when he holds his anger back.   Donggu adjusted in no timeSo much better than KwangheeSource,koreanvariety,d375snu,8,t5_2wv54

Kwang Soo was shouting as part of the act but it did feel a little harsh especially considering that it was also a victory earned by his partner. I feel as though it was better at the end when Kwang Soo at least displayed some sort of actionspoilers punching Garys sides as that at least had a comedic gag effect compared tospoilers just watching the others take his food with disregard to both him and his partner.As mentioned earlier though considering the character he plays and that this is variety its not too surprising.

I even watched yesterday their own remake of the mythical japanese gameshow Run for the money Tousouchuu which inspired a bit Running man on its first episodes. I have to say that watching new varieties it appears their moving on to produce more original content although its very influenced by those programs before. As far i know the Chinese government never liked that much this KoreanChinese coproductions and have tried for some time to hugely limit them. There has been also some unconfirmed reports a couple of days ago about banning commercial promotions and activities for kpop artists and restricting the maximum number of people they could give a concert to dont believe it this much they didnt have almost any sourcesChina lately has been getting heat with almost everyone with all the absurdly overblown Tzuyu case the Hong Kong protest the reclamation of the islands in the south china sea and now this. Huge politic change? Worried about the cultural invasion they were having?Edit More with an article from The diplomat talking about all this ban and specifically about the influence of My love from the other star and Descendants of the sun which were both HUGE hits on China. btw in the article they say that they ban stories with bad inflluences like divorces and affairs and irreal things like ghosts and aliens and then they themselves complain about why they cant have a huge hit like these dramas.

9554578,0,t1_d9qs1iv,Yep I definitely agree with some of your sentiments here. However I would prefer it to be a situation where the leader decides who is sent over for a number of reasons.  In Madongs case the possibility of being sent over might finally incite a rebellion to be carried out. E.g if Sanggook wants to send Hael over Seolhwa and Haesungs faction might be propelled into action to overthrow him. Essentially any move the leader in Madong makes rocks the boat. In cases where the weakest member or the one who is seen as the weakest link is being sent over they have something to prove and might be pushed harder to improve. If we look at shows like Hells Kitchen where there are occasional team swaps there have been a number of cases where someone thought to be negative to a teams performance became a force on the other team. In the end its not exactly a similar situation but it might push certain members to be more proactive and appreciate a second chance to establish themselves more.Some of these might not be possible when the people being swapped are just randomly chosen. ,koreanvariety,d9qsrjk,1,t5_2wv54

Eric at least serves a purpose in that hes practically the only one that I can cook multiple dishes decently although Im disappointed that NaPD let him use a packet sauce for the jajamyung.  KyungSang is just...there.  This seems like his first nonacting show and he doesnt know what to do or even how to be entertaining.  His only saving grace is that he turned out to be some sort of fishing savant.  If he couldnt fish hed serve even less of a purpose as being the owner of the defacto cat mascots.I cant figure out if its because theyre stuck on an island that theres no escape to go anywhere so Seojin is like fuck it and doesnt give a shit.  I mean he and Tacyeon ok well mostly Seojin kept wanting to go to town in S and S so they created reasons why they had to go to town.  They also had a range of stuff to do feed Minki stick Matilda back in the chicken coop feed the chickens feed Jackson and co plant and harvest etc and actual missions and were told what to make for each meal.  I mean heck Tacyeon and Seojin calling mom friends chefs for how to cook something was entertaining.  Not to mention that we got to see Tacyeons cooking progression from someone who likes and is halfway decent at cooking get better and experiment.  We also got to see Seojin who despite much bitching learned and became pretty decent at baking some types of bread.While at the fishing village...they arent doing really much of anything.  They could at least have had the cast plant their own garden name and tend to the chickens and yet..nothing.Im all for NaPD.

The best they can wait for to get some kind of break they still need to prepare a lot of stuff behind the scenes is either that some kind of sport match like baseball gets way overtime or that the highersup decide to have in a holiday some kind of special program in your time slot. Otherwise in fact youre the one making a special edition of your show. Also and i hope these doesnt happen anymore when theres a strike in the broadcaster or there has been a great national tragedy All comedy related programs dont broadcast for a couple of we due to respecting the seriousness of the situation and to join the mourning,koreanvariety,db5mwpg,2,t5_2wv54

10462714,0,t3_5puopf,I hope this is true. I think the hardcore fans of Running Man can agree that it was the combination of the cast that they loved the most. I felt bad for the staff who had to deal with the backlash of the sudden firing of SJH and KJK because you can see in the background how much they enjoy the antics of the members. Personally I like seeing the staffs reaction in variety showwhich is why I loved S ND and every other show Na PD does. I really liked the direction that the youngest PD Hwan Jin PD was trying to take with the show. He wanted to make it more personal and genuine but I feel like the higherups were impatient and wanted immediate results. Obviously thats understandable but not feasible when you have a show thats been on for years. I think the higherups impatient attitude is pretty apparent by the constant rotation of PDs.  During these members week episodes both the cast and the staff have seemed to be relaxed and sincerely enjoying themselves. The cast can actually do something special and different if SBS would let them step out of the box. The cast themselves are just too good. They are all really competitive and sharp when it comes to the games. I would love to see them actually doing a challenging mission that would be both entertaining for them and the viewers. They could film for maybe  days a month or twice a month if its  days and have enough episodes for a month. That way the missions would be more challenging but filming wouldnt be so exhausting. It would also save money so they could actually put that into the production cost of an awesome mission. Something like what I thought Barefoot Friends was going to be like lol.   The show itself is important to the pockets of SBS because Ive never heard of a show going through so much. Both the cast and the staff need a break to rest and plan for a new direction for the show so I hope SBS gives them the time to do that. It would be perfect timing for YJS and HaHa with IC going on a break. Either way Im happy they didnt have to go out out on such a sour note and are getting this opportunity to start afresh.,koreanvariety,dcu1zwe,10,t5_2wv54

11549671,0,t3_64qgqx,Heres my take on the matterWhen Season  started there were  holdovers CTH and KJM and the rest were newbies. The new members were lucky because the veteran members let them be themselves. CTH and KJM merely reacted to them rather than lead them. Given this Joonyoungwasnt really burdened with the seniorjunior relationship since even the oldest members Joohyuk and Junho were also new additions and in that regard they were on equal footing. Though one can argue that Joonyoungs personalitycharacter is the type that doesnt worry about this dynamic.Enter DongguSiyoon who was evidently really awkward towards the other members especially the older ones. It also didnt help that Junho was a bit cold to him. In his first episode Junho already dissed him as a kid who just got out of the army and not some popular korean star. You can clearly see during the scenes at the start of the trips where they arrive at the location that Donggu was properly greeting Junho with a polite handshake left hand under the right hand. In more recent episodes though Junho would offer the half hand shake half hug to Donggu and one time even hugged Donggu from behind. I really cant fault the guy for being respectful to his elders. Though its boring for a variety show it can be a good thing for younger viewers of the show to have a role model like him. Donggu is getting better though. Yes its taking a very long time but with the PD change and the inconsistencies in the editing its like the show is no longer bothering to give him a specific characterrole. I  disagree with you though. He has already shown that he fits the current cast. He may not standout as much but he is one of them.,koreanvariety,dg55pe6,9,t5_2wv54

I didnt think I would like Sechan but he seems to fit right in with the male cast while throwing over the old age hierarchy a bit. As people have commented Jihyo also seemed a lot more active than she has been in the past while. Super glad as well that they seem to have shot down the KwangsooSomin loveline before it even started because their squabbling chemistry is a lot more fun.

If I recall correctly HH also said he has gone to Garys house many times and slept overnight because he was too drunk to go home. You dont do that unless youre close friends with someone.  ,koreanvariety,dgpklzc,9,t5_2wv54
