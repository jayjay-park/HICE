9704489,0,t3_5dzcjn,This type of fundamentalism is based on an implacable reading of Scripture which views inerrancy as taking nearly every part of the Bible that does not announce itself as metaphor a la a parable or a vision as historical or literal truth.  So when God said God created the world in  days that is literally what happened which precludes an evolutionary explantion.  There science then is to take pot shots at elements of evolutionary theory that contradict their claim  such as creating a meaningless distinction between micro and macro evolution or focusing on statistical anomolies in carbon dating errors  as they could never demonstrably prove their claim directly.This reading of Scripture typically goes handinhand with a rigid reading of Romans  and Leveticus  which few on this sub espouse so I think youre going to be equally hard pressed to find any YECs around here.  If you really want to go down this rabbit hole warning its angry and condescending check out rChristianity.  rRealChristianity will be all YECs but that sub doesnt seem too populated.,GayChristians,da9abk6,1,t5_2voba
