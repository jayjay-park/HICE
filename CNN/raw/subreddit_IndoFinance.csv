Might as well invest your own in better performing investment. unitlinked insurance is notorious to give huge bonus to their salesperson. and guess where that huge bonus coming from? yes you! but if you dont care much about the money want caring agent since theyre paid huge able to keep monitoring and keep topping up the insurance fee when the market is declining. then unit link could be okay for you.,IndoFinance,dc9o83s,2,t5_3i2cr
10395355,0,t3_5oncwj,Start with building an emergency fund to cover  months of expensesliving costs. As for mutual funds I just started myself you can check the performance of your funds online. ,IndoFinance,dcmdosv,1,t5_3i2cr
10410587,0,t3_5oncwj, if you did decide to invest in mutual fund especially equity mutual funds dont bother with checking it everyday in fact you only need to check it once a year I myself treat my mutual fund like a normal saving account just transfer a certain amount of money into there and leave it. why bother checking it everyday when you arent going to do anything regardless of what happen.   I am not expert myself but I would suggest to not invest in stock because you really cant diversify with only jtmonth. Just pick a few mutual fund and keep adding it up.   I myself have set up some emergency fund like  months expense that is not a lot its like around jt in bank account and then another  months salary in money market mutual fund it didnt return much but it still better than nothing and then invest the rest.    hope this help.,IndoFinance,dco3vyv,1,t5_3i2cr
