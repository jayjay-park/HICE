278518,0,t1_cf9m5ti,That works cause chrome is my main browser anyway! Thank you so much for the help. I have one more question regarding browsers actually can I change the Router Console to automatically open in Firefox instead of my default browser?  This is the field they allow me to edit under Client Configuration but Im not sure whatwhere to insertnet.ip.apps.systray.UrlLauncher ,i2p,cf9mq3n,1,t5_2s99t

811828,0,t1_cgwdx5f,It really depends on your threat model. IP does not try to hide the fact that youre using it. So if you are afraid of someone knowing that then a VPN is good. Otherwise it will just slow down your connection.How do you know you can trust your VPN provider? ,i2p,cgwk4uz,3,t5_2s99t

1186313,0,t1_ci2zivv,UDP firewalled warnings is one of the buggiest features on ip probably its not you could be your ISP endpoint. About the browser you can use any browser you want. I use chrome for instance with Proxy SwitchySharp   ScriptBlock.edit any browser will open by default if View console on startup is ticked at ,i2p,ci32uv9,1,t5_2s99t

4583970,0,t1_ct78skq,Heres how I understand this system Google scans the internet for malware and ships out blacklists of networks and websites that server malware and sites that point to them. Chrome uses this blacklist and warns people and Firefox does not.I think this is because one of the sites or networks hosting a mirror is on that blacklist and if we can figure out which mirror it is an remove it itll probably sort itself out.Im all for systems like ip but if the projects mirrors arent trustworthy thats a very serious security problem that undermines the point of anonymous communication channels. Not everyone checks the SHA listed on the page and the page containing the hash itself is served with a certificate Chrome deems outdated If bandwidth is an issue would it be possible to throw up a torrent to host this? Is bandwidth really an issue? I imagine ip is not exactly Apples latest OS in terms of bandwidth requirements...,i2p,ct8esma,1,t5_2s99t

6623710,0,t1_d00f8jq,Id be really interested too. Just check if Ive got this right pleaseon the CLIENT not the outproxy  I make an http tunnel that redirects the traffic coming from say localhost  to the server b I then set the privoxy rule to redirect for example the mozilla traffic to localhost On the SERVER Outproxy I make a tunnel taking the incoming connections to the b and redirect them to... yeah this is where I stop where does the tunnel redirect it?Thanks!,i2p,d04g5hr,1,t5_2s99t
7944025,0,t1_d488ksz,Oh thank you!  Yeah I could definitely add that in...I didnt realize you could use it as a proxy for clearnet torrents.  I confess that Ive only been using IP for a little while now so I have much to learn as well.,i2p,d48zdt4,2,t5_2s99t
8434532,0,t1_d5qddox,Also note thatd require more CPU more memory and a inbrowser database that will also need to be persistent. That will require reseeds and more problems...Just leave it if you really want it port some part of IPd use CtoJS converters and you should be happy.,i2p,d5vutom,2,t5_2s99t
