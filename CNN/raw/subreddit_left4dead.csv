2551574,0,t3_2ox6ha,The path changing thing is a good idea. They actually implemented it in the campaign runs on LD for example the cemetory map on The Parish. I have no idea why it wasnt taken into Versus mode. Gathering stuff along the way is a bad idea imho. Personally I hate RPGs and other games where its about looting and finding stuff. It feels like im cleaning my apartment playing games like that. I dont want that playing a fast paced shooter. Its more fitting in games like DayZ or something.What LDseries should work on is making the game a nicer community to play in. Ive been playing computer games for a more than a decade now online and never have I been in an envirement more hostile than the LD one. Luckily I have found my good set of friends to play with so I always have a good time playing with them. But the amount of shit you get playing with pubs or even from the enemy team is beyond me. So how to go around to solve this I have no idea. I think part of the problem is how players really are only put into two categories. The people who doesnt do mistakes and the people that do. So the people who makes mistakes gets all the attention and all the abuse.  A rating system wouldnt really do much I think. I feel part of the joy of the game is people doing silly mistakes and helping less experienced team mates through the map. What they should put in is training maps for the special infected. Attack together! Dont attack firstalone with the spittersmoker  Give a set of guide lines on how to play the tank let them experience how quickly it dies running into  shotguns.Finally bring the hunter from LD back. Why they dumbed it down to the blurry ground attack infected it is now I have no idea. Well I do but its not necessary. ,left4dead,cmrmm6q,4,t5_2qn2k

7296714,0,t3_4fc6qj,Im big on custom maps. Silent Hill and City  were pretty well done. There was another crazy and crazy long map too. I really want to find that now...edit Its called Fallen. That was a fun ride. Its stupid as hell but stupidly fun. I Hate Mountains is another good one if you want a Blood Harvest feel and Hunter Training is... well what it says on the tin.,left4dead,d27l4sv,3,t5_2qn2k
8134003,0,t1_d4u0qmm,First off let me say I dont think its because game companies are moneywhoring machines. They are meant to make a profit how they do it is up to them and if they stay afloat because people buy their shit its their thing.But its not that I think that monetization systems hurt games it helps them more than hurting them keeps people playing for something games fresh multiplayer alive which LD hurts by not having one although they get k players daily anyway. I just dont like it Im not fond of it doesnt increase my personal love for a game didnt need it when I used to spend  hours a day at the cybercafe playing HLDM or CS . but I get its the future of gaming.Yes selling cosmetics is better than map packs obviously. Selling cosmetics real life money or ingame shop system which will cost more time but thats how its supposed and should work that do not change gameplay that is which GO OW and other games do so all good but still becomes a fashion parade about who has the prettiest skin not during game before and after.Then theres cosmetics that changes gameplay a lot and that can be bought by money or ingame shop system that give me bad vibes TFs for example. I havent played TF long enough to talk about it but I know part of the lore and how some guns are essentials for some roles. Even if the gun is under a dollar that system is not for me.,left4dead,d4uc33n,1,t5_2qn2k
