6976497,0,t3_4avdsw,This is why someone like Apple needs to get in there and do it for real. Smartthings is rushing in there trying to get control of the home automation space but not doing it right. They have a lot of the functionality you need but the reliability and potential privacy is not as strong as you would need from a premier home automation providerThankfully I only use smartthings for little things like lights coming on when I get home and Logitech harmony connection to my echo for tv stuff. Id never connect door locks or use it for any sense of security or anything serious.

I recently had trouble pairing a newly purchased GE Link bulb to my old Link Hub the Quirkymade hub thats sold in a pack with two Link bulbs and when I emailed for support I got this response gtHello Samgt Im sorry to hear that youre having issues getting a new GE light connected to the Link Hub. Unfortunately you wont be able to connect that light to the GE Link Hub because of the Bulbs firmware. The Link Hub stop receiving firmware update because of it manufacturer Quirky is no longer is business. They hold the rights to the Hubs firmware at the moment and GE is currently working on trying to obtain the right. We dont have a estimate on when they will receive these rights. gtIf you do like our system we highly suggest you look into our Wink Hub. This Hub will control more than just lights and is always receiving update from us. gtSorry for the trouble. gtRegardsgtWink Customer Support Obviously I cant say whether that extends to all Quirky products but it sure doesnt sound great.,SmartThings,d2suktd,5,t5_2uug7

9734651,0,t3_5eixcd,Alexa talks to ST using the cloud. There is no local interface to ST like there is with Hue. Some devices run locally but remote control app API echo is always via the cloud. I came from a Veralite running HABridge and I havent noticed much of a difference if at all with execution speed. Maybe a split second more. The only thing that is slower for me is accessing Harmony through ST vs locally through HABridge. It takes  seconds vs instantaneously before. Lights are about as fast as they were when Echo was talking to them locally as virtual Hue lights.,SmartThings,dad0aoq,3,t5_2uug7

I still think its a great idea and it has a lot of potential but once Samsung bought them out its like the founders quit caring because they already made their money but have stuck around because they are contractually obligated. They rolled out a lot of improvements that didnt work and ST has been trying to fix that screwup for the last year and a half.   I have very little faith in ST anymore. Id love to be proven wrong and have ST become the gold standard in home automation but I seriously doubt that will happen. ,SmartThings,dc4bgb4,2,t5_2uug7
