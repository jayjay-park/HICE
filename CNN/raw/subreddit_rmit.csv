4528213,0,t3_3d2v0t,No probably not. I failed  subjects  semesters in a row write your exception application and you should be fine. Of course youll have to repeat the subjects but you almost definitely wont get excluded. ,rmit,ct1f23y,1,t5_2ta66

5057281,0,t3_3k0jwd,I think they keep it a year or so after you graduate. I think I read somewhere its kept for graduate program purposes or RMIT alumni or stuff like that....then they deactivate it. I still have my email and account from the university I transferred away from to RMIT.,rmit,cuvld9g,1,t5_2ta66

6609609,0,t1_d02yfan,Maybe. Youll have to talk to your course coordinator. Theyre completely different core subjects so youd essentially be doing two different degrees back to back which would take a long time or have lots of overloading. Accounting and BIS on the other hand easy as  subjects are the same. But yeah talk to the head of your course about wanting to do a double degree  its pretty ambitious,rmit,d02zmrm,1,t5_2ta66
6647329,0,t3_46kspd,Brunswicks orientation is on the rd Tues Bundooras is the th Wed and the citys is on the th Thurs. I went to the Bundoora orientation day with a friend. It wasnt a bad day just a few lecture type sessions that covered housekeeping stuff like MyRMIT passwords and information about the services and stuff. I didnt bother going to the orientation for the City campus though which is the one I attend.You might get an email with details about the session ashalenko mentioned in their comment. Maybe use this  and see if theres any information. Because I never went to the city orientation on my first day I just made sure I had the campus map on my phone and ensured I got to every class a decent amount of time before it started. Also if its any help I found the best way to start conversations was to just ask anyone waiting outside the same room if theyre waiting for the same class as you are. Good luck,rmit,d06w41k,2,t5_2ta66

7888568,0,t1_d42ke02,My old one has a picture on it. Its identical to the new one  same name student number etc  just that it expired in  when I finished my last course. I assume there wont be any issue using it if I only need it for id to sit on my desk.Thank you for your help. ,rmit,d42qxue,1,t5_2ta66
9085847,0,t1_d83yo3s,If you dont want to ask your teacher and youre trying as hard as you are to justify doing it in your post you know damn well you shouldnt do it. And besides you think a teacher isnt going to notice a bluetooth earpiece in your fucking ear? What do you think theyre gonna say when they see it? Youd just get in deeper shit when youre caught in the act. ,rmit,d83z0fa,1,t5_2ta66
