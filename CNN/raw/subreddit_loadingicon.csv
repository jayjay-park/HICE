Is this C? ... yep ahaha it is. Perhaps the magic of Processing is in its IDE?I was expecting a more succinct or higher level code not Cstyle fors and uhm bitshifts and other C stuff. Perhaps pjs is more convenient because it can be more higher level with stuff like array.map.,loadingicon,ckaan9n,1,t5_30y4w

3856276,0,t1_cqvua08,What you said was that it couldnt be parsed as a real loading icon. To which I can confidently say that it can be a real loading icon.Im not sure if you used parsed in the proper context but Ill explain how you are incorrect.You have two values. An inner circle value and outer circle value. The inner circle counts from  to . At set intervals the outer circles value updates to match the inner circles.The animation that occurs when this happens can be done in several different ways depending on what system you are implementing it with so Ill just explain the math of it.You need to get the total circumference of the inner circle and create an arc that is the same percentage of the circumference of the inner circles value.You then need to do the same calculation for the outer circle.You then interpolate the position stroke size and length of the arc you created. You then continue this until the arc is in the correct position on the outer circle.After a set amount of time you then repeat this process with the remaining segments of the outer circle until the total length of all the outer circle arcs are the same value as the circumference of the outer circle.Of course you will need to animate the colour of the arcs as they hit the outer circle as they have a slight glow.To create the outer force field you pretty much repeat the same thing as you did for the main part of the animation.As I said it is entirely possible to program this as a functioning loading icon without faux values.,loadingicon,cqvundu,1,t5_30y4w

Also the slight pixelated filter is reminiscent of the fade inout effect used in the movies.Not to say yours isnt original it very much is.
