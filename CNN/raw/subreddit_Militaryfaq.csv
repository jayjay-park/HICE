7363768,0,t3_4g7fod,gt he claimed that I can enter as an E rank. This sounds fishy. My father left the military at E and immediately starting higher sounds off. Also theres a thing with boyscout ranks and military equivalents that we didnt get intoNot typical. I believe Nukes can get E after theyre done with training if they elect to take an extended first enlistment. Some SOF receive E during training Army Green Berets I assume Navy SEALs as well and in the Navy it is possible to test for E very early in some fields. Starting as E or E is a lot more typical for Eagle Scout college credit whatever. So technically possible but unlikely.gt he claims I could choose any field that I want. This sounds like the bait. I checked some of the fields on one of their sites and theres a distinction between officer and enlisted fields.This is pretty much true as far as enlisted jobs. If you qualify it and theres a slot at MEPS you can do it. That second part can be tricky and usually involves a combination of luck the slot being there when you want to join and persistence refusing to ship for a job you dont want. The only way the military is going to pick your job for you is if you let them like choosing an open contract or if you fail out of training for the job you chose.gt The fields available include nuclear Intel or... Whatever. This looks believable assuming the above is true however there are always stipulations involved.Yes those are real fields and probably ones you will be pushed towards if you score well on your ASVAB. The more technical fields tend to involve more upfront training and as a result tend to have longer minimum service obligations. If youre in school for the first  years of your career they arent going to let you only sign up for  years.gt I could serve  years and leave with a Bachelors degree in Nuclear Engineering. This is just unbelievable at best without any sort of backup evidence or anything. This souls like a very good offer but there was nothing to support this claim.This one is pretty much recruiter bait. Technically possible to do this as a nuke but not very likely. If they see you as a viable candidate to go into the nuke field theyre going to throw a lot of stuff like this at you. None of it is straightup lies but none of it is as easy as theyre going to make it sound.gt could the PiCat score be used only for the Navy branch or any branch? If any what would be good alternatives to the supposed nuclear Navy path or Intel?The PiCat is really just to let the recruiter know if youre a candidate worth pursuing and give you an idea of what jobs you may qualify for when you actually take the ASVAB. The ASVAB is the test that really matters and all branches use the same test. The scores are transferable. As for good alternatives that depends entirely on what you enjoy andor what you are good at.gtEssentially what the hell did I just get myself into? I may or may not be ready to sell my soul to the military just yet depending on what information I get out of this and future questions to ask the recruiter.You didnt get yourself into anything really. Theres no obligation to  do anything until you actually leave for training. If this is a path that interests you do your research and make informed decisions.

11230135,0,t1_df4vf8m,Honestly? Yes it may be better it may work out for you but the odds will still be stacked against you. Back pain can be absolutely debilitating Ive fractured several vertebrae in my back it is not fun and your back is not something you can live without or get a real replacement for. Take care of your back I stress this to every soldier I have or take care of it is the absolute best thing you can do for yourself short of quiting smoking. Your health should be the greatest concern you have always. Even if you get it surgically corrected it doesnt mean it cant come back or that it will be successful or eliminate currentfuture pain. While it may help and it would be better to get it corrected if you are dead set on joining I still advise against it. Unless you have literally zero otherbetter options to make a living outside the military I would avoid it. Im sorry that this is the hand you were dealt it sucks I know Ive seen plenty of it but simply put joining the military is not worth a lifetime of pain and suffering. I cannot stress how bad of an idea I think this would be you can read through my old posts I rarely ever discourage people from joining and give lots of advice about the military and the benefits of joining but its not for everyone most people its not for them mentally in your case its not for you physically I would feel like I was injuring you personally if I advised you to join its not worth it man.As far as a government job goes you can always look for a job within your state government if you agree with your states politics and just stay out of federal. Or move to a state you do agree with that has a good track record of staying that way a blue state that always votes blue by a safe margin or same for red. that way you still get a government job where you feel you are supporting your values and beliefs either way best of luck to you my friend.,Militaryfaq,df4x5ul,1,t5_2tf5m

11767601,0,t3_67x0xd,Im not sure how the legal precedent looks on this that would be interesting to get into but is way beyond my resources. I think your question probably has two answers depending on a little context. Maybe three. Up front though theres no element of rank disparity explicitly mentioned in Article  of the UCMJ sexual assault though it does delineate other elements that remove the ability to consent. Scenario Enlisted person and Commanding Officer. This is clear and handsdown fraternization a violation of Article  of the UCMJ. So given that its a relationship of equals by nonequal persons an argument could be made that the junior is not in a position to consent due to the implied power dynamic. Not sure if that argument has ever been made but it probably has.  Scenario Junior Officer and Commanding Officer. This isnt covered by Article  but is likely a violation of Article  as there are usually subordinate unit orders against relationships within a chain of command. This is a grayer area in my head as it is less likely to pose a good order and discipline problem like fraternization but favoritism among officers is a big deal in its own right.I forgot what the third potential scenario is. Sorry Ive been hit in the head a lot. ,Militaryfaq,dgtvzdr,14,t5_2tf5m
