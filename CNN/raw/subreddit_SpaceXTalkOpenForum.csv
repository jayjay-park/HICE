1699659,0,t3_2dv629,If any of you get banned from rspacex by echologic for criticising him message the mods there with the link on the right of rspacex becuase the other mods are better  although they havent reversed mine yet even though he admitted thats why he banned me.Others well I know georedd was anyway have been successful in getting the ban reversed when echo banned them .Just beware that on rspacex echologic is constantly removing posts that are critical of companies like ula or mention efforts to attack spacex.If one of your posts is deleted by himPlease link to it on rmoderationlog or rundelete   To know if echo secretly deleted your post log out and see if it still shows up in the Que because he wont always tell you he deleted it so you wont know to complain.  Also if you dont like echologic acting like a nanny and prescreening all your pro spacex posts while he posts his own anti spacex stuff then complain to the other mods about it.  Likewise if he privately curses you etc in private messages. He often acts differently in private messages when he tries to intimidate you or threatens you with bans than he does on the subreddit.Just know you are not alone in being threatened and abused by echologic if it happens to you.,SpaceXTalkOpenForum,cjtel13,-2,t5_32t2x
