6068291,0,t3_3ynm0q,Im not sure about rF but you can get a demo of rF that comes with a couple cars and  track I think.I dont play either online but I know that either will most likely not be good compared to Iracing rF servers have usually been empty when I look and Ive never played rf online.In rF if you can unzipunrar a file and copypaste files from within Windows Explorer youll have no problems installing mods.For rF I just use the content installer included in the game and its as easy as aiming the installer to look at your download folders for car track and mod files and then clicking install.Whether or not the mod is decent is dependent upon what youve downloaded. Most of the mods I have installed are found at DrivingItalia.net and the now defunct ? rfactorcentral.com  this site is still there but seemingly not the files.,rfactor2,cyf1jz9,1,t5_2yhky
