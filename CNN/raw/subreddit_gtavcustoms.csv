1387367,0,t3_29xq4j,I dont know. I love the muscle class. Ive got half a garage full of them myself. But the bug catchers and the green color dont feel right for all these cars. Personally I use the scoops sparingly. On the wrong body they stick out awkwardly. I like the Blades unique gasser hood for its classic feel but to me the mods mess up the lines of the Phoenix and the Buccaneer. Some cars just dont need much extra  to look amazing. Less can be more.And the color... Im not in love with the combo as you obviously are but even a great color scheme isnt right for every car. The Buccaneer and the Vigero can handle it but I think the rest would be better served with more diversity. I dont know the first thing about these cars in real life but from a purely aesthetic standpoint green is too dull for these monsters.,gtavcustoms,ciq6sh0,1,t5_2yivk

3548685,0,t1_cpwk38l,I think the looks of the car overcome some of its performance shortcomings.Also the car is not all that bad.Its easy to try to compare it to other cars in its class which can outperform like the Massacro or Elegy. But the thing about the Rapid GT is that it brings some killer acceleration in addition to bestinclass braking to the table. However it demands that you not get cocky when trying to sling it into turns at high speed. If you do it will love to lose traction and crash you for it.Ive made this convenient little chart comparing some of the most popular sports stats and it helps illustrate that according to the stats the GT isnt a bad car at all. It just has some weird handling traits.,gtavcustoms,cpwru39,2,t5_2yivk

10192579,0,t1_dbzdvg3,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,gtavcustoms,dbzdvj4,2,t5_2yivk
