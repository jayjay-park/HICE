Judging from the descriptions Umbitch is the only person that is empowered to make a decision.  I also think that a lot of the dementors are active on the subreddit for the evils so they might just look inactive.  We really should seriously consider inactives.  That being said...

Given that none of us can trust anyone who volunteers to be frozenpoisonedcured we can vote on who we choose in our own minielection. To ensure that we dont just end up with TR voting in a block we can either make everyone input their username when they vote or decide right here and now to pick the rd place or so person. I can make a Google doc for it and we can go from there with very public results. Its potentially a wasted night of either freezing or poisoning but it could maybe confirm Star. It could also help bolster uBolts and uDirtyMarteenys claims. Or Star is TR and she lets someone get poisonedfrozen.  Or we accidentally pick a TR person who lies for her if she is also TR.

My advice to you would be to try and scry the Monster players that have NOT been listed here for watching as the WW are too smart to go after players they know are protected.  shaman uCanadianSalmon please for the love of everything in this game please continue to go down the list of unconfirmed players.  I trust your judgement on who to choose but I also like uBolts plan of dividing the work between the town the hexer and you.I think that we should divide the work like this uCanadianSalmon can work on uAwesomewow usevilyra umilcom ukariert uSrslywtfdood  The Hexer can work on ububblegumgills uisolatedintrovert umegabanette  uderivedatass uMalvidian  The rest of the town can work on udancingonfire uchamberthecartridge uknon ulittlebs uMeyiox AND whenever Canadian reveals a werewolf the next cycle we work on lynching them and canadian swaps out for a name on the Village list.EDIT Oh I see what I did there mal is listed twice.  Switched out for Srsly!EDIT I would just like to add that there are at least  individuals in each group that are somewhat confirmed.  Lets leave these players for last.

9515257,0,t1_d9ly1nf,The Innkeeper is probably one of the most important roles for the town to use as a tool IMO. This puts a check on the wolves to make sure they are not all voting in one pool especially if a majority of them are located in either the top or bottom half of the alphabetic roster. The Innkeeper has to be on top of their game though to make sure they are utilizing their power as effectively as they possibly can.I would rather someone get lynched by an organized wolf vote that shows possible consequences for them because the Innkeeper could be watching than an organized town vote which will almost certainly I would guess .chance be an innocent. There are way too many people to point a finger out so that the wolves can displace any suspicion on one of their own to the countless other suspicious people who are actually innocent. Its all a numbers game and we unfortunately have to be prepared for a bunch of innocent deaths especially in the early game. There is too many variables for the evil roles to hide behind right now.

After the attempted cooking of umilcom the others were less than keen to engage in another of Marys activities. Mary had shut herself in her cloud cottage. uthreemadness occasionally piped a tune to attract more townspeople but her heart wasnt in it. The others went about their business in silence.There was no denying it. The people of Heaven were in a funk.But that was all about to change.As a blinding light flashed through the gates uSecretSquirrel entered Heaven. Only she was different from the other residents of Heaven for she was a Werewolf.Arghhhhh! A Wwerewolf! screamed uthecoolkid. Quick everybody hide!At once Mary came bursting out of her cottage. A werewolf? she repeated. Squirrel caught her gaze. Oh... oh my she said immediately flushing.Attracted by the commotion Lamby stuck his head around the corner to see what was happening. A werewolf in Heaven? This wasnt good.Mary get away! cried umegabanette. Shell kill you! Shes nothing but trouble!Oh but this is trouble I dont mind getting into replied Mary a fiendish glint in her eye as she approached the hairy werewolf. Helloooo there. May I... invite you into my cottage?Squirrel looked at her in silence for a moment before speaking. In all my time I have never seen a maiden more babin than you Mary.Mary blushed. Oh! How do you know my name? I dont think I told you.Because Ive been watching you from afar for many moons now replied Squirrel. And also because the author couldnt be bothered shoehorning in another introduction into this repetitive narrative.Oh my giggled Mary I do believe Ive found my next... special friend. She tore open Squirrels tunic to reveal a muscular hairy chest even though Squirrel was a girl so there were no boobs on her for some reason but who really cares at this point. Take me. Take me you animal!Nice pun! uHyperWackoDragon chimed in throwing in a cheeky highfive to Mary. Come with me whispered Mary her eyes fluttering madly. We shall touch butts and make love like this world has never known!The two disappeared into the cottage. Within moments slow seductive music began playing.Thank Mod muttered ualchzh. At least we get a break. Mod knows you deserve one right Lamby?Lamby did not respond. He was too busy staring at place where Mary and Squirrel had just been. How could this have happened? What had come over him? He had never felt this feeling before the thing he felt when he looked upon Squirrel. He had never felt it but he knew the name. This was love.With a rush of energy Lamby moved to enter Marys cottage.No Lamby! Out! barked Mary. Youre not part of this! With that she slammed the door in his face.Oh. Im sorry Lamby said threemadness sadly. Lamby did not hear her. All he heard was the muffled sound of a werewolfs cry girlish giggling and the sultry tones of  Cents Candyshop. More than anything in the world he wished he was in that room right now instead of Mary.His thoughts were interrupted as a pair of Squirrels Funky Trunks underwear came soaring out the window to land on Lambys head.

9564622,0,t1_d9s0imn,None of my accusations are random  Its just a question of whether or not Im taking it seriously or not. I think you get taken seriously because you only accuse people only based on actual observations whereas I accuse people to get them to talk. Thats usually based on a gut feeling and their response to it helps me decide if I should pursue them or not. Example Larixon last game was SUPER SHADY while she responded to my accusations. So was ChefJones this game but I know otherwise now. Yesterday Dep was super chill about my accusation which is why I changed my mind but by then it was to late. If I start an itemized list about why they are suspicious chances are that Im serious. If i just tell you that they have hairy forearms Im probably not serious.

11113460,0,t1_dernmka,Yeah I agree with all these points. Even though having his pair bond come out would possibly save him from lynch he still didnt want her to. Because the other DGs may attack her and then he would die as well. He didnt care about coming out as PBd himself because a DG attack wouldnt harm him. All the pieces are falling into place IMO.

11121733,0,t1_desm2nq,Thank you.I knew that my current playstyle wasnt sustainable. When information is scarce people turn against those that help too much umoostronus and those that help too little too many people right now.I wanted to reveal so I could help and discuss things without being afraid of giving too much away. There were times where I caught myself saying too much and it really hindered my ability to join in on most discussions over the past couple of days.Mainly where I had to bite my tongue was when people were discussing who to lynch and suggesting that kids were the best age group to select players from. Obviously I had information that that wasnt necessarily the best choice.Still Im not convinced either that every test subject is good. I am however quite convinced that the silencer IS one of the subjects due to the wording of the silencing.In terms of strategy. After  games I feel like theres little new that any of us can come up with. I dont necessarily belief coordinating roles such as doctors seers and parents is a good idea. Unpredictability should be our main weapon. Still giving suggestions and pointing in a general direction could be helpful. I just hope that every player knows that suggestions here arent orders and to still rely on themselves to make the decisions in the end.Im afraid I dont have anything in terms of concrete suspects yet. Theres quite a few players in here who I have not really played with so Im pretty bad at noticing changes in play styles for those players.From now on out though Ill be able to join in more often... If Im allowed to live past this or next phase.,HogwartsWerewolves,desn10m,17,t5_3cc80

11166689,0,t1_dexq1xs,Thanks! I hope the plan works but I really dont think its a good idea for my parent to reveal even if we match. Maybe if I get dragged to TUD then they could reveal or just get me out of there and then I guess the video reveals it?
