I was an alternate last year and got upgraded a week after I received the letter.BUT if you have other things going for you such as job opportunities financial issues and the like then I wouldnt recommend holding out for it.

3304620,0,t3_2xz5y6,I did a little bit of research on this a few weeks ago. I found out that some phones wont work on Japanese cellular networks. For example I bought a iPhone S here in Australia but this wont work over in Japan even with a Japanese sim card. Its something to do with different companies LTE Band support across the world Im not too sure on the technical specifics. However the iPhone  probably will work in Japan with a Japanese sim card. I know that Apple have a page that lets you review the compatibility based on your iPhone.Of course thats just iPhone. Im not too sure about other phones models. It might be worth looking at googling the phone you want to get and seeing if certain models wont or will work on Japanese networks.I found that the major cellular companies offer   year contracts with a new phone but there are a number of smaller companies popping up that allow you to pay month by month with a BYOD bring your own device at a considerably cheaper price. However there are some reports that these smaller companies have slower data speeds because they are renting bandwidth I think thats correct off the major networks.I think I decided to just get a new contract in Japan if I get into JET because it seems the easiest option and a current JET recommended I do that.I did a little blog on it if youre interested ,JETProgramme,cp4ybqx,2,t5_2w9xe

3924734,0,t3_35ehbu,Well there are other programs that do allow you to do a similar thing to JET such as Interac but they often dont provide the same support or pay that JET does. Generally for Japan JET is the best option for teaching English.Your major or Japanese ability are of little concern to JET. They may test your Japanese ability in the interview should you get that far but its basically for bonus points. I was shortlisted this year and I know probably  words in Japanese. Dont sweat it.Id recommend anything that could be seen as relevant to JET Japan or teaching. That includes volunteer tutoring international exchanges looking after children Japanese activities kendo karate flower arranging etc. coaching sports teams etc. I really dont think that something like a fast food job would be seen as relevant to Japan or JET. Almost anyone whos applying to JET will have had some kind of job or work experience before in their lives.Youre lucky because you have a year left of school. Thats enough time to get into this kind of stuff if you havent got any so far. Try and find some volunteer opportunities at your university! I tutored incoming exchange students in English.Its also important to mention that you should think about this not only as a way to get to Japan but as a job. If youve never worked with kids this might not be for you. You want to have things in your life to bring something to the table that benefits Japan not just things that Japan can do for your life. Simply wanting to escape your country isnt likely to be a good enough reason to impress JET.Edit Sorry if any of the above sounds harsh.

3957921,0,t3_35qjsl,Hiya they dont base it on the current exchange rate actually they use one about a year or two old and only update it once a year or so. The threshold for repayments is  which the JET salary exceeds so you will most likely have to make monthly payments. Before you go you should ring them to let them know youre going abroad and theyll send some forms to your home address around November asking about your earnings. For proof of your earnings you can use your  most recent payslips or the contract stating your yearly salary. Having said all this at the end of the day student finance are pretty incompetent. Out of the UK JETs I know despite us all getting the same salary some have been told they dont have to pay anything back some are paying like  a month.  Personally I pay  a month. They take it from my UK bank account.,JETProgramme,cr7fq9r,3,t5_2w9xe

All theyve had is an interest in Japan and the JET Program. So its definitely possible! I doubt the success rate is really all that much significantly higher or lower its probably fairly even. I saw someone the other day say something along the lines of Theyre not looking for someone who knows everything about Japan if they wanted that theyd hire someone inside the country.

5550824,0,t1_cwkggf1,What they mean is that bad grades or currently being a student arent a restriction. And people are lying when they say you never get in on your first try I an many other JETs did.I nor anyone else cannot tell you to apply or not. JET is a big step especially if you are still in school and have never done anything for yourself before I dont mean that in a bad way. All I can say though is that tomorrow never comes. If you want to do something do it before you settle in and lose that chance. There is little point in waiting or holding out. As you noted the application process is lengthy and waiting until next year means hopefully becoming a JET in  two full years from now. Thats a long time to maybe be working a part time job.I had the benefit of applying to JET after graduation after Ive worked and after Id lived on my own. At  when I applied I was in an entirely different situation than you or a lot of undergrads are in. But I also twiddled my thumbs for over four years falling into depression and pity instead of pushing on with a JET application.

For example instead of study the discrepancies between A and B say study the correlation between A and B or how A affects B or how language comprehension and retention holds up with practical application. On your written application I would be a little more careful with phrasing than you would be in person. As we all know it is difficult to discern tone via text and you dont want them to get the wrong impression. That said if it is a genuine interest of yours you dont need to leave it out entirely. If you make the interview you can explain your interest more indepth and perhaps bring up a counterquality depending on how receptive your panel is.TLDR be true to you but take caution not to accidentally shoot yourself in the foot.

10017687,0,t1_dbclggv, Me being black never comes up as a topic in class. I did have an entire chapter on Obama that I had to teach my st and nd yrs but we didnt delve far into race relations in America nor did I talk about my own experience of being black in America. The chapter did talk about segregation and of course I added a bit of context as to what that meant. I watched as the students eyes glazed over and become disinterested because they didnt understand. The only time Ive gone in depth with race is when my small group of rd yr boys had a chapter about police in Japan. When I asked them about how they felt about policemen I got a resounding Fgtltk the police. We then somehow got on to talking about police brutality and racial profiling. I would never ever broach the topic of my race with my other students for  reasons. One My students do not have a very high level of english so this conversation would go over their heads. Two There are too many of them to have a sober and effective conversation. Its much easier to talk with small group of boys vs a group of  kids. Three I dont feel its necessary. I am here to be fun and helpful not to bring my own struggle into the mix. If my kids want to know they would ask me as my boys did. which is how we got on such a tangent in the first place lol. If it closely pertains to the subject in the book I will add more context. Im an open book to my students but I keep my sensitive opinions to myself. My being black has never effected the way people in the office treat me. I do my hair however I want. I dress however I want professionally of course. I dont get any passive aggressive comments about my style or suggestions to cover up like other female JETs have experienced. I am much curvier than the average asian woman but I am still easily able to find clothes that fit me. That means that a dress on me may flatter my figure more than another japanese woman. I dont get any comments on it. If it was a problem Im sure Id hear something from supervisor or other JTEs who have no qualms about saying anything and everything that comes to mind. A trait I value immenselyMy school overall is pretty chill but I get the added benefit of being a foreigner and thus I am left to my own devices and am not expected to conform. Im different and my school my school respects that. Even if they didnt I never came here with the intention to fit in anyway lol! My high school kids dont stare at me lol. Even when I first got to the school they didnt stare they actually were disinterested in me because my pred had done a bang up job of making them hate English. Its mostly elementary aged kids and younger that stare. Im usually the first black person these kids have seen so its no wonder they get all wide eyed. The kids are so adorable though. I just smile and wave. Sometimes they wave back sometimes they just stare harder. They are just too cute!!I know that this was a rather long response but I want to be as complete as possible when answering your concerns. There isnt much out there about being black in Japan and alot of views are jaded.

10191514,0,t3_5lwore,I work for a BOE so I teach JHSES in a large city but my office covers a really big portion of my prefecture. There are only  JET ALTs in my office including me but some of the other Municipal JETs  Im sure all the other contracted ALTs that are hired in the offices jurisdiction as well are managed overall by my office my supervisor doesnt have direct contact with those other ALTs but I found out they fall within my BOEs jurisdiction when I heard my supervisor mention there was a problem with one of the Muni aka JETs hired by a towncity JETs and he was concerned what to do about the situation. As for how many schools all of the JHSES JETs in my prefecture teach at multiple schools. I personally teach at   JHS amp  ES but one ALT at my office teaches at  schools. Though I also know  JETs in a different part of the prefecture that teach at about  schools so theyre known as oneshot ALTs. I also know quite a few SHS ALTs here who also have a visit school.

I completely want to stay in Japan as long as possible but I told them that I had clear plans on how to come back and start a career here that would continue to broaden Japans influence and soft power here.

When I used tinderanother dating app most of the women were ALTs and military ladies so I didnt go on any dates that way.I think Japan is really behind with LGBT rights and generally the older people I talk to have a limited understanding of gay people. My supervisor told me he didnt believe in gay people until he studied abroad and was hit on by a male professor. He also thought lesbians hate men and have daddy issues which ummmm no?
