6308363,0,t3_4200ql,I want to also point out that your newest post to rTopMindsofReddit has been approved and is still waiting your response.As a question  you are starting to appear very biased in your sourcing. You point out that the government has safety regulations on EMF but ignore that the WHO does not list EHS as a valid disease. You claim that people arent qualified scientists to opine on what you post but have not confirmed your own credentials. You claimed that biology isnt taught in science classes and that doctorsnurses cannot opine on medical matters because they are just taught to regurgitate medical texts.So what is it? Who can actually talk about this stuff?,Electromagnetics,cz6ouns,3,t5_39962

My B lab test improved but was still low.Methylcobalamin mixed with DMSO and applied topically or methyl B injections are best. See the Vitamins B wiki.B deficiency does more harm than cause dopamine deficiency. B deficiency can cause methylation problems megaloblastic anemia nerve damage and dementia.The typical B test is not that accurate. ,Electromagnetics,dfuhrtu,2,t5_39962
