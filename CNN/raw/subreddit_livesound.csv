25735,0,t1_ceh7rjs,Food for thought. For everything you need and a  budget...I think Id talk to the powers that be and point out that you could spend k on rentals every year or spend k this year and then nothing for the following years. For  channels of good wireless mics and elements  is not much at all. You might have already thought of this but... in case you do end up having to rent if you talk to the sound company maybe one that specializes in wireless at least one I can think of in DC and mention that you do multiple shows every year and youll do every rental from them you can probably get a lower price on the shows. You also might be able to have them come and set it up the first day and not have a tech on site for a week. ,livesound,cehd25n,3,t5_2remi

Bought enough batteries and chargers so that I could swap them out entirely every show if I had to and I havent.I usually get around  hours of run time out of a set of NiMHs safely before they need to be recharged in my Shure URs. They last me two sometimes three seasons before they start to lose capacity to the point where they need to be replaced. As a bonus theyre recyclable.I used to buy several hundred Procells by the case twice a season. it cost me a few hundred dollars per show.

321874,0,t1_cfd3j16,Using less power than what its rated for is fine. It just means youre losing a bit off your maximum output. As long as you dont run the amp past clipping nothing bad will happen. You can use a simple splitter to feed the signal to both channels. Each channel input has an impedance of kOhms unbalanced so youll have an input impedance of k with inputs paralleled. Your preamp shouldnt have a problem driving that. ,livesound,cfe4s4d,1,t5_2remi

Also try to pack light hauling camping gear is no fun to start with after a few days of grueling stage work its even worse. Dont pack anything you truly value where possible. Be sure to have a comfy and waterproof pair of walking boots with steel toe caps and a good mutlitool. Carry your own gaffa and lx tape and do not share them.

Most bands larger than say  capacity clubs will have a monitor engineer. I think youre a little  misguided in thinking its a training position beneath FOH.  In many situations MONs is a tougher gig with more intense requirements and abilities.  You should absolutely branch out.  You can continue being a FOH guy even on the road its not that scary.  Be up front about your experience and be willing to work for a modest rate.  The artists you are working with sound like they are outside of the music industry and more of a nichelocal act without ties to the larger world.  Probably steady income but what is their management? What record label?I would ask where you are working.  What you want to be doing is networking with other bands management companies record labels.

1632854,0,t1_cjij1wi,So a lot of components in an amplifier have a maximum electrical throughput. As the components are driven harder the very tops of the audio waveform are starting to hit that limit and so the amp cant reproduce them properly. Instead it just sits at its maximum output for the amount of time that the audio level is too high. That results in a squared off waves being sent to the speaker.Thats really it there isnt any very complicated electrical stuff going on to my knowledge.,livesound,cjkzig5,1,t5_2remi

Youd have to go listen to it at a showroom like Guitar Center or somewhere.But Im guessing its not going to sound that good for music  but youre asking for air transportable and theres few off the shelf systems that you could roll into an airport in one easy piece that sounds very good. Good speakers tend to be really heavy even if they were small enough for transporting.It might suit her needs but when I think live music and DJing and I see small and inexpensive speakers like that I tend to wince because they tend to be really muddy or harsh sounding.Part of that is because people try to turn them up too loud or dont have any experience running a sound system.For the record  truly transportable sound that sounds good is a known problem in live sound.My dream audiophile grade live sound system has collapsable lightweight speaker boxes and lightweight efficient amps so a  or  person crew or so could backpack a small to medium sized stack of speakers into remote locations to throw outdoor parties or beach parties or whatnot.

Usually I have all the cast going through a stereo group with an additional DCA that just affects chorus mics or those who usually do backing vocals. The band goes through their own stereo group and I usually assign the drums to a DCA too so I can alter that easily without affecting the group. I dont normally record scenes  Im more a fan of mixing onthefly as it helps you adjust for varying levels of performance from night to night.

2715652,0,t1_cncpdpx,Obviously there are many ways to do things but my general rule is to not fart around with vocal EQs too much. I will clean it up with a HPF and maybe a db here or there but I usually try to run them flat. The reason is EVERYONE knows what a human voice sounds like. EQ can easily make the voice seem alien or unnatural. Use some subtractive EQ on the instruments in the mid range where your vocal sits so it has some room to breathe.Again that is just my method there are other completely competent approaches that differ from mine. ,livesound,cncrbvs,3,t5_2remi
2731936,0,t1_cn2ghtp,Yeah it really is simple.  If you can use a Mac you can use MainStage.  The comment about audio latency is very relevant as the audio buffer and sample rate make a huge differenceluckily you can adjust all of these and even see the Millisecond readout in MainStage itself. Ive used two MainStage rigs simultaneously for gigs and Ive been able to get around  samples for the io without anyone noticing anything including the keyboardists.  Modern macs and most pcs have more than enough hardware to provide a seamless experience.  Another thing you can do is purchase additional plugins and sound libraries.  The stock sounds are great but if you just need something super particular like a specific Hammond or Yamaha Piano you will have to spend a few hundred on a sound library for itbut these are easy to find online.A word of advice thoughget to know MainStage and how it works before putting it in front of a musicianas not everyone understands software and when the inevitable I pushed a button and now it doesnt work!

2820358,0,t3_2sb3rv,I havent worked on a ship myself but I have some friends who have. From what Ive heard it really depends on exactly what your position is when it comes to your hours. You should expect to be working every single day during your contract. Some days might only be an evening rehearsal or a matinee show or just some paperwork while youre in port. In that case you are generally allowed off the ship during the morning to go sightseeing.       As far as an employee lounge I guess it depends on the ship. Every ship has an employee bar and youll probably have some down time where youll have a chance to hang out in one of the theaters or lounges. If you make friends with one of the drummers you might have the chance to noodle around a little bit but I wouldnt expect to be able to play regularly.        I dont think its common to get promoted within a single contract although I guess if someone has to bail out of a contract or a spot opens up they might shift people around. Obviously the higher level production jobs will probably go to people with more cruise line experience so youre on the right track. Again you will have down time so use it wisely to talk to other production people just not when theyre busy working and explore the ship see all the theaterslounges and learn the gear there if you can. If you dont get along with your cabinmate you should talk to your supervisor ASAP. I think its probably easier to switch cabins on day  or  rather than waiting until youre a month into the contract. You dont have to be best friends with them just get along well enough to be able to maintain your own sleep schedules.,livesound,cnoo1x5,1,t5_2remi

The commission will help with the REALLY LOUD KIDS but priori gain is about the only asset you have work the quiet kids.  I dont believe the MGC had an expander as part of its channel striocompression.. I remember reading wireless and if its not dropping out pops and other odd noises then your in business. Just make sure that the antennas are not blocked to the receivers. .  Since you are the teacher your familiarity with the musical is an asset. Use that. Also use some students as tech staff.

I had an acoustic musician friend looking for a small mixer and he was keen for AH however upon a closer look at the eq sections and maybe? actually measuring what they do  and ignoring the plentiful positive and assuring marketing speak I recommended Soundcraft to him and all is well with that.Yah you are making me want to pick up some  or  rack or whatever although I have been dumping my spending money into stage wire subsnakes building stuff cone drivers and speaker boxes.

You can park the beast and enjoy it and use it. During the last year I have had the good experience of providing system for a bunch of touring acts and the savvy ones pack their own digital mixer use wireless for their inputs  wireless inear monitors mixer is onstage or side stage and mixing is done with a wireless tablet. This is pretty much the formula for mobile rigs now. It makes for effective kit. The techs do the set up and at show time the band walks on stage and powwie! you have a great show. No sound check no line check no nothing. It takes pretty good engineers to do this but the last act I worked with they had a small trailer x? that had their drum kit and electronics and they did a superpro show in this manner. This type of kit is sure space efficient so for travel their is something to it. Also really advanced lifer engineers can do things with multiband compression on inputs kick drum and bass guitar that is really out of this world but that was just one guy who was at that level of mixing but he sure did a great mix that was enjoyable to listen to and made my mains system sound good. So it is a complex thing the skys the limit if you know how to use the stuff.errata new development some of the tour guys are getting sick of digital kit all everywhere and welcome seeing  hearing  using a good sounding analog desk. So the reversal has begun the burn out from digital monoculture. So that is pretty cool if you are using analog desk. The last guy was taking phone photos of my old school rack mount Goldline M  octave analyzer and he was really into it had never seen one before.  mine is silver not blue and has factory rack ears.,livesound,co9xft0,0,t5_2remi

Nobody knows what you need as well as you do though. I prefer to get more small speakers because they are easier to carry. Like I would go for some good loud  speakers and then get two  powered subs. Maybe another bigger one to add if you play outside. Especially for a DJ when you go outside youll be missing bass. Something else to consider if youre every playing a big outdoors show where you need a larger than life PA you should probably be getting paid enough to rent a big PA or even just some extra subs.

3246792,0,t3_2xa1cl,If there is any other wireless used on site it will be a tremendous advantage to use the same make and model of system that is used elsewhere for ease of selecting and coordinating frequencies.Edit The big problem with using wireless mics is the probability of interference  both other people interfering with your system and you interfering with others. They operate in the same frequencies used by television so you and the nearby users have to avoid any frequency used by broadcasters near enough to be a problem   Within the spectrum that is left it is not merely enough that you be on a different frequency than anyone else leaving gaps of  to kHz  cheaper mics are much less able to filter out mics operating on nearby frequency but you must avoid frequencies where harmonics of mixed wireless signals will be a problem.  If the other mics in your church are Shure SLX then if you also buy SLX it is a simple matter to buy a mic in the same band that they use set it to the same group that they use and choose a channel number that they do not currently use.  Otherwise you may need to enlist the aid of a consultant who can do a frequency coordination between mics of different manufacturers or if it is only a few mics use the calculator on audio technicas website by manually entering all of the frequencies used in your building and by your near neighbors if there is a church or school across the street.... That one will only tell you that you have a problem however not how to choose a frequency that will be better....,livesound,coyje2i,3,t5_2remi

4596682,0,t3_3dym9p,I would go with either the XM or the Yamaha CL series.  I do a lot of mixing and either would fit the bill well with what you describe.  Yes the XM only allow  technically  inputs at once but unless youre doing massive things that is more than enough channels IMHO. The block routing on the XM is in blocks of  but you can reroute anything at the single channel level.  However I dont do this often because I teach my students personally to set up their stage boxessnakes logically and to avoid repatching at the board unless highly necessary.  I love the RTA function over the EQ as a teaching tool on the XM consoles as well.  Workflow is also good and it has full DCAs which can always be on the top page which I think are a must especially in large environments.  The scribble strips are also a life saver.  If you are considering getting a console that doesnt have scribble strips reconsider for that fact alone.  They are a huge timesaver and make flipping to different presets a breeze.  Recording on the XM is very good to any multitracking software especially since its done over the USB bus.  Ive recorded several musicals and bands straight to multitrack again as a learning tool.  The  key differences on the X vs the M is the preamp change k processing beefier faders and the ergonomics of the screenediting area.  I know a few folks that have the M that think its work the estimated k list price difference.  Ive used both and theyre fantastic consoles.Ive used the Qu boards and Im not impressed by them at all.  Yes they multitrack record internally but I found the workflow to be sloppy for large musicals and the mastersmatrices are neutered a bit.  The fact that theres only  DCAs  real matrices they pan LR to make  outputs total and you would need to set up a custom layer to avoid page flipping to get your DCAs on top make it a bear of a console for large FOH events.  I did run a Qu as a mix monitor console a few months back and it fit that workflow very well.  I dont think itll be a very flexible console in the years to come especially with only one dsnake port on it with AampH proprietary protocol.In the usability department the professional engineers that I have come in on a routine basis loved the MCL with the most features and the REVX reverb despite the board having a large footprint.  They also love the XM for the best bang for the buck and the nice sounding preamps and loathed the Qu because of sloppy workflow and neutered mastersoutputs.,livesound,cta03ym,4,t5_2remi
4658807,0,t1_cthsavf,Let me first establish what I deal withThe role of a sound engineer is seen as a lowly job in the eyes of managers. It isnt seen as a throne in peoples eyes here in Cambodia. Typically you have  engineers working a desk. Typically all  are sharing headphones behind the stage. Most venue owners and managers are firm believers that all they need to do is spend  on a system and it will always sound good.Safety is also not a standard here. There are literally no grounds in most establishments.Shure microphones and other professional equipment first came to Cambodia only  or  years ago. Before everything was flooded with fakes and still is. With that you are mostly dealing with fakes. Not to mention investing in proper equipment is risky because there is a high chance it is likely fake. I shouldnt be able to pick up a  JBL speaker as if it was a plastic box of feathers.Also you are dealing with a crowd that assumes that once they purchase some equipment suddenly they are a professional and will learn so many bad dirty habits that you can never correct. Unfortunately most locals think that this is the norm because they have been exposed to such bullshit for years.For example just last week I shouldnt be the one to teach the Ministry of Cultures own head sound engineer how to mic up equipment wrap a cable and explain how exactly a parabolic parametric EQ works I got the only digital mixing desk in the country Allen and Heath QU which has a digital display of your EQ settings.EDIT Forgot something else EVERYTHING is distorted.

I turn the input channel down take it out of the red and walk back to the desk to turn my end up. You can see the panic in the DJs face. Half way back to the desk the DJ turns up the mixer and it starts distorting again. So I return to the DJ box. Mate! You need to turn it down out of the red as it sounds like shit and Ill turn it up at the mixing desk. I repeat the process. Half way back to the desk the DJ turns up the mixer again  slowly this time like he thinks I cant hear it   So I return to the DJ booth again MATE! TURN THE FUCKING MIXER DOWN AND ILL TURN IT UP AT THE DESK END!!DJ Starts getting pissy with me. OK I say you know best sound like shit then. So I just return to the mixer and limit the fuck out of everything. The DJ then proceeds to push everything as far into the red and he can.

Line Arrays can extend the near field with a drop off of  dB per doubling of distance to quite far distances reaching even hundreds of meters for high frequencies and long arrays. In arrays the elements shooting of in the distance also get compensated for air loss by slightly increasing the level of the highs.

6630119,0,t3_46cooy,Im not sure if it will help but I can tell you how my father came to be a professional audio engineer back in the s.His friends growing up started a local band and wanted him to run a mixing board since he was into all that electronic stuff.  This also included building the sound system for the band as well.  Over the next few years the band got fairly popular in their city and the system kept growing to accommodate larger venues.  It got to the point where they could rent out parts of their system to smaller bands needing a rig and eventually the system rental became more lucrative than actually performing.  Somewhere around this time he was contacted by a rep from a sound agency Tasco to work as a professional sound engineer which he did for several years. I suppose its about getting into the scene and making yourself known and waiting to be picked up.,livesound,d0540oc,1,t5_2remi

Varying range of experience you may be the least knowledgeable and still be the one they end up bringing back more and more. All they want with that description is someone who can take orders follow directions and work their ass off.Talk to the older hands there if they seem like theyre willing to talk. Ask them about how they got into the field what their job entails. Ask them how you can help them. NB dont talk to an engineer while theyre mixing. Even backstage on mons and youre bored and they dont seem like theyre doing much just walk away.Going forward with them Be on time. Weve said goodbye to a multitude of folks due to lateness. Answer the PM promptly when they call or email. Write those dates into your calendar and do not double book yourself. Dont call out unless someone is dying or you have an actually bad case of the flu.When you do come back help with what youve shown you can do and try to learn a new thing every time youre in. If you dont know how to do something ask. If you dont want to do something due to a safety concern disclose that to the supervisor. Listen to their response and see what you can do. Push yourself.

They have two XLRTRS inputs with an input selector which is handy. One input has a ground lift button neat feature. Weve had these s running for mains and monitors in three different bars. Live music  days a week all day long. Not ONE has blown on us and some of these guys are really deaf. My EKX s sound a good deal smoother on the top end and bottom end. Best way I can describe them is tighter lows and silkier highs. Cant comment on durability because I havent had them a full year yet. The features however are really cool.

7415450,0,t3_4gvfpd,Depending on what kind of mixer and sub you have you may just be able to bypass the crossover and go straight to the sub. If the sub is powered and you have an extra aux output on your mixer then you can just send whatever you want to go to the sub on that aux output but plugging directly from the aux out to the sub. This will keep all panning completely independent of your sub level and allows you to adjust how much bass and kick drum you want to go to the sub and how much you want to go to the mains. If the speakers are passive it will be harder to do but still possible. If you dont have an extra output on your mixer then you might be SOL but I mean even my tiny  channel mixer that I use for practice has an aux out so theres a very good chance yours has some extra outputs as well. And if you have any extra outputs you could always think about setting up some monitor mixes so the band can hear themselves a little better even if you just run vocals to them it helps.,livesound,d2l373v,1,t5_2remi

7806691,0,t3_4m7v9w,It really depends on what you want to do. A little bit of backgroundFirst there are multiple types of  connectors and multiple signals. Most guitars output a high impedance high Z signal to an unbalanced TS connector Tip Sleeve. Pedals are expecting this connector and signal and so are guitar amps via their  connector.Some pedals particularly acoustic pedals have a DI builtin. This converts your guitars unbalanced high impedance signal to a balanced low impedance signal which is then sent to the board. Why? Sound boards dont love getting a unbalanced highimpedance signal in the first place but they especially dont like getting a highimpedance signal over  feet of cable. The impedance creates an antenna out of the cable and while you can get away with it on short runs sometimes anything longer is asking for weird stuff and interference. With cellphones in play Ive had issues with even short runs. So having a DI out is great if you want to go straight from your pedal to your board. It shouldnt matter on the run to your amplifier though. And you should really use the guitar input on that Fishman amp not the XLR which is designed with a microphone in mind. A high quality DI will usually improve the tone of your instrument regardless of the run length as its equipped to handle the signal given to it better than the preamps in most soundboards. You could scrap that microphone if your pedal acted as a DI though. ,livesound,d3tj8ur,2,t5_2remi

You can also use a split snake so FoH is free to do what they want your XR then becomes a monitor mixer and you use one of the outputs to provide FoH with the backing tracksOr you let FoH do its thing and run their monitor feed into the XR to mix them with the click and route back to the performers.You CAN send the click to FoH if you want so they can redistribute to the performers personally I prefer to handle the click routing myself.FoH  front of house the venues soundman and mixer if you will,livesound,d49177f,1,t5_2remi
7968025,0,t3_4nzkgl,There is a tremendous amount of misinformation on here...There are many options for network redundancy beyond the Dante primarysecondary networks... There are activestandby options spanning tree there are activeactive options port channels. Each has downfalls which is why the primarysecondary networks are the best option. STP convergence times can be a problem depending on what implementation of STP youre using. Port channels could possibly have weird issues depending on what hashing algorithm you use if you loose a port without the link actually going down... Have fun troubleshooting if you loose a port without the link going down some streams may be going down one link and others going down another so now some channels dont work but youve got no indication... Im not sure of any layer two ECMP but if something did exist you might induce super weird issues with out of order frames but I havent tested that.The problem with most of these issues is as you stated youre not a network guy... Your best bet is to run two primary two secondary cables out to your console and keep a computer with Dante controller running out by you... Let the console do its thing and fail over if need be and then swap the line manually. Its by far the easiest way to add another layer of fault tolerance even if its a manual change. ,livesound,d4bojpt,2,t5_2remi

8651222,0,t1_d6myosk,I think your hand is more likely to be forced by having a limited number of circuits in the space than by optimizing like this but. My first priority would be to keep your stage gear instruments guitar amps monitors FOH and PA on the same circuit to eliminate ground loops. Very unlikely all of that would exceed the capacity of a single circuit so you should be fine.. Second you usually want to separate any sound gear from lighting specifically incandescent light dimmers. Those can be electrically noisy. But IME modern ones are pretty wellbehaved. And of course this doesnt apply to LEDs treat those like any other electronics.No strong need to separate anything other than what I outlined above and probably not even .

The trouble you describe definitely sounds like some EQ might clean it up. I also think it might help to mix in some ambient Mics as well to help give your voice some space so it sounds more like singing into an open hall versus directly into your ears.Heck if you have enough open space and cared enough you could set your self up with a dedicated set of channels  mixed strictly for the ears.,livesound,d9w86wt,2,t5_2remi

Haha  that name just doesnt get old.So youre saying if I grab a mixer bring it home output it to my studio monitors and theres no noise  then its definitely not a ground loop issue? Just wanting to confirm.Also what is the point of a DI. I mean my Audient has a DI  input as well as the two XLRs on the back so is this to suggest my Audient acts as a DI  albeit one without a ground loop solution?In your experience it seems like your recommending the Behringers over the Yamahas then if I want less noise?Another thing so if I use my own mixer arent i then just essentially outputting the mixer to the PAs mixer? So what solution will it offer there?  I also heard another strategy in another thread that said to export my tracks in two parts one for percussion and one as instrumentation?

10221007,0,t3_5mce3h,When it comes to monitor mixes unless its a band Im touring with I tend to leave things as natural as possible  minimal EQ minimal compression no fancy effects dry as a bone unless they ask for something different. My only thing is trying to get the panning in a good place for artists ears. My IEM mixes are always stereo because we have two ears!Ive done some experimenting and I leave outboard DSP well alone  the latency introduced can throw things out of whack in IEM land sometimes even with wedgeusing musicians if theyre used to something  more immediate...However if Im doing regular gigs with a band then I open up the toybox! I do a moderate amount of sidechain compression to do things like turn off ambient mics when the band are playing and set up dual splits of my money channels  vocalists get their own vocal back uncompressed with individual EQ and more treated versions of everybody elses vocals or instruments. Very useful if you have an artist who likes a big and brash sound due to hearing damage  they can get a guitar sound like a biscuit tin full of wasps and everyone else gets something which sounds like a guitar. Opportunities abound for inserted dynamic EQ onto very dynamic instruments  strings are a good one to start with. Sidechained deessers on acoustic guitar channels to pull some of the HF back when the artist is singing to give them a little more space I like to make my job as easy as possible  if the monitors are all set and then mix themselves I can spend more time perfecting my own vanity mix...!,livesound,dc2lwul,2,t5_2remi

Since the drummer is the least likely to be able to easily get the monitor techs attention then having the console in a position where the drummer is naturally facing that direction should help.Ive run monitors from both sides of the stage and found its much easier to communicate with the drummer if Im on his hihat side.,livesound,ddylgmt,33,t5_2remi

11518382,0,t3_64e82c,Formatted copyyou need to separate list with a line break. Do you prefer analogue or digital consoler when in a live environment?. Are there times when you would prefer an analogue desk over  digital desk or visa versa?. How do you find the workflow of a digital desk when compared to an analogue desk? Which is easier to master?. Which consoles have you used both analogue and digital? Which were your favourites and why?. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of both analogue and digital systems?. Is there any real noticeable difference between the sound quality of an analogue and digital desk?. To what extent are digital exclusive features useful when compared to analogue features?,livesound,dg1lz5t,2,t5_2remi

11559854,0,t3_64zz8t,I had a similar problem at a venue before..   What we did was  We ran the mic cords to a pre amp under the stage and juiced it.  By the time it got to the board the radio interference was so far below the signal level that it was never heard.  Never had problems with drumsguitars and the radio tower just the vocal channels.  ,livesound,dg6bb13,5,t5_2remi
11632627,0,t1_dgeceih,I dont think your date is necessarily correct though. In some areas TV stations are getting out of that band as early as q  and I believe testing begins as soon theyre finished. It depends from area to area though. ,livesound,dgekk3x,1,t5_2remi

11672220,0,t1_dgiwh8a,But for the venues where you have a real live FOH engineer with a pulse theyll want everything no matter how big your marshal stack is. Theyll look like shit when you levels arent right and heshe cant do anything about it.I think youre pretty well prepared. Like others have said just do up a stage plot  and make sure to indicate where you need power drops. so many bands forget this.In ears that you mix takes a huge chunk of work off the engineers plate and possibly an easy night for the A so you should already be on their good side.,livesound,dgj2967,5,t5_2remi

11700317,0,t1_dgiveoj,If youre trying to automate every mute for every time an actor speaks and then stops speaking youre doing your musical very wrong. If youre automating mutes onoff per book scene or several per book scene you wont run into the scene limitation.,livesound,dgm8zug,-1,t5_2remi
11711708,0,t3_66x60z,I dont think a compressor is a huge deal if you run duos or karaoke nights especially if youve got your mich technique down so Id rather get a nice AampH ZED instead of a Yamaha MG and loose the compressors if I were in your spot the AampH Mixers are just a better build quality in my experience.If you dont mind the extra complexity of going digital and already own a tablet a Behringer XAir or Soundcraft Ui seems to be the the way to go at that price point.,livesound,dgnjva7,1,t5_2remi
11744323,0,t3_67j7ct,If the keys are set up lows on the left blending to highs on the right not much. If the keys have multiple properties blended between the left and right it can be very helpful in widening the mix. If it is a Leslie or Leslie emulator it is also good. It takes less time to run a second line then it does to read all the suggestions. Run a LR and try it out if it sounds better panned then do so. In fact try all you can to make a bigger and better mix. ,livesound,dgr8yuh,2,t5_2remi

11762165,0,t1_dgt510q,I dont you think you quite grasp what a crossover is. At the crossover pointfrequency both the HF and LF are attenuated by dB. Thus dB  dB dB to provide a full range system. Both the HF and LF speakers are producing the same content at the crossover point thus if there is a delay between the HF and LF at a given point then uh oh bad news.,livesound,dgt9rfv,3,t5_2remi

11808720,0,t3_68htqt,Couple people asked about my spreadsheet the other day here is an amended copy a friend is hosting for demonstration. Basically you fill out the input list on the left then figure out where you want each of those to land either in the stage box or the console. You can edit where the stage box lands in its green field. You can see the formula to create your own spreadsheet with your list of stageboxes and consoles.You can split these parts up into sheets too that can help keep things organized when you have a lot of moving parts.,livesound,dgyk5cg,2,t5_2remi
