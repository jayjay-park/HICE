A good argument is one that stands on its own merits no matter if its presented by a character or by a real person.    You know characters are written by real persons too...    gt Yeah when she says everything is problematic thats totally not ironic Its about to get problematic up in here really? Does anyone take that seriously?    Thats the problem with these feminist extremists its Poes law all over the place.  But she says The truth is literally everything and everyone is problematic  and if that would be irony than she would actually mean that nothing is sexist?  Do you really believe that that was her intention?  No they really mean everything they repeat it over and over again      I know it sounds nuts but thats new wave feminism in a nutshell pun intended... maybe .    gt I also cannot remember whether she actually say we cannot change if she did shes wrong in my opinion but that still wouldnt legitimize why we shouldnt change the media.    She didnt say that we cannot change she said that we cannot win there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Its a constant life long struggle.    gt Enjoyment is not a moral good in and of itself. If and thats a big if feminism andor feminist analysis is the right thing whatever the fuck that means it is irrelevant whether or not you can still enjoy stuff.    Thats wrong enjoyment is part of well being.  Our morals in a nutshell are basically  good stuff  stuff that increases the well being of a population  bad stuff  stuff that decreases the well being of a population.  However the goal is to maximize individual well being as well. Sadly this isnt always possible which is why morals are really complicated.    So the well being of an individual say a murderer is sacrificed for the well being of the rest of the population by e.g. locking himher away for life.  We know that this is not perfectly moral and its expensive thats why we try to find other better ways to cope with crime e.g. prevention.  So if feminism  constant misery for everyone constant struggle by propaganda and unlearning of undesirable behavior but everything is PC now  classic dystopia.    gt Yall like to pretend that someones gonna come and take God of War  away because its a sexist piece of shit but the usual solution in social justice activism is not to take something problematic away but to acknowledge that it might be problematic.    Oh boy are you wrong about this one        Most of these bans are due to feminist complains.  Music?    Get that shit banned and celebrate.    There are dozens of examples like that.  Feminists obviously not everyone but a lot of them really do want to ban anything they dont like or they dont approve of.  Some are less nazi about it and only boycot media that contains things they dont like until they change it to fit their narrow point of view      Never mind that men in this show are tortured maimed and even get their dicks chopped off... thats fine but a woman is raped? Dear god THAT is going too far.      gt systemic racism is a thing and that they dont face certain disadvantages because theyre not black ultimately its not White peoples job to tell African Americans how they should go about reaching equality.

6165233,0,t3_3zwmos,Some context  background info this is going to be a long comment  sorry in advance.. The police in Cologne is notorious for playing down problems. For example after a violent hooligan demonstration a little more than a year ago    the first official police reports were also claiming that the demonstration had been peaceful or something along those lines. It might well be that once more mostly the police is to blame for the delay in information.On the other hand Germany has the same problems with political correctness as other Western countries so it would be tantamount to political suicide to suggest a causal link between the migrants culture and religion and sexual assaults.. Regarding asylum statistics for GermanyHere are last months official statistics issued by the Federal Agency for Migration and Refugees They show . new asylum seekers a  increase over . Note that this number does not include those refugees that have not yet officially asked for asylum. Which is a significant fraction as German officials are simply unable to cope with the sheer number of asylum seekers in a timely manner. The total number of refugees that came to Germany last year is estimated to be close to a million.Apart from the absolute numbers the statistics are quite similar to those from Austria see page  About a third of all asylum seekers  are from Syria Syrian and Iraqi refugees combined make up less than half of the refugees. The report also does not break down these numbers according to gender other than saying that a total of . of asylum seekers were male so we cannot draw any conclusions from this data regarding your hypothesis that disproportionately many Syrian refugees are families.. A few words about the general political climate in GermanyMost surveys now consistently put the Euroskeptical and rather rightwing party Alternative fr Deutschland AfD  Alternative for Germany at close to . With values in the double digits in some eastern German states. By current European standard thats not too bad I guess but still troubling.As you rightly observed some people in Merkels own party CDU and especially their Bavarian sister party CSU see  about their relationship have been raising concerns for some time now. Lately there has for example been a heated debate about possible upper limits for the number of refugees to take in per year. CSU leader Horst Seehofer has recently been suggesting a limit of k per year while Merkel herself so far completely rejects the idea of fixed upper limits. It will be interesting to see how this develops over the next weeks especially in light of the NYE events.. Regarding Merkels statement about crime rate The clip predates the current migrant crisis  its from . Here is the full video It is one of Merkels weekly podcasts which are available from her official website see   yes Merkel actually produces weekly podcasts!Here is a rough translation of a larger part of the video starting around  into the video  with some omissions and some shortened sentences but hopefully retaining the general meaningI will talk to the ministers of the interior of the federal states how we can ensure that there is no space in Germany where the police cannot guarantee the safety of the people and the population.Our goal is both to ensure safety in our cities and to fight the causes of violence in our society at the same time. This holds true for all parts of our society.But we must accept that the number of crimes committed by young migrants is especially high. For this reason the topic of integration is closely connected to the issue of violence prevention in all parts of our society....I will discuss with the ministers in detail how to effectively guarantee safety in all public spaces while furthering the integration of the migrants living in our country  because we need all young people in our country and we want those who have come to us with a foreign background to have the same opportunities as the children from German families. But to ensure this means to show zero tolerance of violence and to focus all our energy on improving integration in our country.So she was conceding the higher crime rates to then argue that violence prevention efforts are a necessary part of a successful integration process. The larger context of this is that for years there have been immigrantdominated nogo areas for police in some larger German cities.,SargonofAkkad,cyqf9d2,1,t5_38l30

If a victim reports it to the police all the usual investigations and trials and whatnot occur the way youd expect.gtNo person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.Title IX requires universities to actively address discrimination which has come to mean that allowing an accused rapist to remain on campus to be discriminating against the alleged victim. Actually proving a rape happened is secondary theres enough money involved for the university that simply expelling the accused and maybe getting sued is cheaper than not expelling him and getting sued by the alleged victim.A lot of MRAs and generally concerned citizens are trying to address it using due process claims but Im not sure exactly how successful that will be.

6743008,0,t3_4806cv,I despise HRC as a candidate as much as the next Redditor but this is shit sensationalism.Did you watch the video Shes asked if she believes that white terrorism is as much of a threat to the country as something like ISIS she responds by stalling with some mumbled statistics for a bit then puts together a narrative comparing the Oklahoma City bombings to . Most of the way through this she drops in a single line about how the police are capable of terrorism meeting the definition. She does not compare them to ISIS its not part of the story shes telling not what shes comparing and contrasting. She also mentions Hadiya Pendleton because the question she wants to answer is about more than just terrorism but all sorts of organized violence.So the Daily Caller is right that she veered off to talk about gun control and spoke of police violence that terrorizes communities  but that in no way constitutes a comparison of the cops to ISIS. Contrary to the article headline shes not the one calling it white terrorism the person asking the question is and she doesnt say anything about the relative magnitude of threats that said the Daily Caller here relies on an implicit assumption that ISIS actually constitutes a major threat on US soil which probably resonates with their core readership but comes with a huge fucking citation needed. They seem shocked that she would dare describe Timothy McVeigh curiously they dont name him but instead the building he targeted which is far less of a household name as a guy who hated the government or say that the bombing was terrorism as far as Im concerned.

And you need more than this vague statement specifics please. gt Sentence is incoherent.Rape culture was imaginary in the west until the west imported migrants for the nonwast that did have rape cultures. ie NYE in Cologne.gt Um... yeah that is how you address social injustice. There is nothing wrong with that.Hahahaha yes. And you cant see it yet. Creating social injustice is not the solution to getting rid of social injustice. It is still injust. Two wrongs dont make a right an eye for an eye makes the world blind. Treating people on character and not on other characteristics is liberal the ideology of freedom for people. You are going counter to that. Your ideology is regressive to that. An example of what we are talking about. gt Maybe I am not consciously moving the goal posts as you claim. I have pointed out a few of the times you have done it. It is too hard to show each time. Why dont you state the point you would like to make and we will address that. Bias and fallacies are rarely conscious. gt  I simply do not see what you say is the case as being either real or a significant problem.You have already stated it as a real problem. You have shown through your actions that it is real. I have said nothing on the significance. Just because something may or may not be significance doesnt mean that it isnt a category. Neither you or I can speak on the significance or size of the problem. You see if significance is an issue you are moving the goal posts. That isnt the topic. The question you have was that it doesnt exist. Once you state it exists you state it isnt significant so imaginary.gt I agree that some cases that are raised may well be individuals overstepping the bounds of what I think is appropriate but other cases may or may not be since there is not enough information or the reports are biased.But this explanation does not preclude that use of the word for those circumstances. You here are admitting that the there are people that do this that say they are liberal seeking liberty but act in was very illiberal by limiting liberty by enacting laws that treat people differently not based on character or actions but on things like race and gender. gt We have real problems in this country and they sure as fuck are not university professors doing or saying stupid things.Yes it is. If they put down ideas they dont like in an arena to explore ideas. If they promote and push for the treatment of others in an illiberal way. Yes that would be a problem.gt Um yeah. Im an atheist. Imaginary things dont exist.Duh but that wasnt the point. Your classification of imaginary is arbitrary and subjective. It isnt even working for your argument. YOu have several times shown and said there are people that oppose liberty and equality but say they are liberal. That is what you asked for to be real it is by your own actions and words. gt The statistics are real the crimes are real but the conclusion is false.Come again? This comment in no way addresses what I said. This is non sequitur. And sure you can misuse statistics sure. Like the aggregation of all men and womens pay as an indication of discrimination when it is the individual choices made that are different and a difference in preferences. You just dont like how people are using their liberty. That is why it is liberty though they are allowed to make those choices that you dont agree with.You need to state something more than it is wrong. Why is it wrong? Actually the department of justice was trying to prove that there was racism in traffic tickets in New Jersey I think it was. They were building a case and studied speeders to prove blacks didnt break the law more than whites so the tickets were unjustified. Found that they were that blacks were more often sped and broke the law. Now I dont think all blacks inherently break the law because they are black. I think there are things like liberals saying that you dont need to follow the laws because they were made by white men or they are racist and going to lock you up any way. Or as a society they have less respect for law and order because they feel is wronged them in the past. Or maybe my thoughts is that it is an economic answer blacks tend to be poorer and poorer people tend to break more laws and get punished for those broken laws.But regressives what all statistics to line up with demographics which is never going to happen because this is a complex system with many independent actors making their own decisions and if a group tends to prefer one things or acts a different way more often then you wont have these nice pretty lines. gt I am a liberal. I am not however a libertarian and libertarians are not liberal. They are conservatives.No you are not. At least not with regards to affirmative action. That is a very illiberal idea. It neither promotes liberty or equality. It attempts to wrong a wrong an eye for an eye. It seeks to reduce liberty and equality. You my dear were a reason this word is real and needs to be used. Semantics you made up or redefined.Liberal Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality. Whereas classical liberalism and European liberalism prioritise liberty American liberalism and social liberalism stress equality. Libertarian Libertarianism Latin liber free is a political philosophy that upholds liberty as its principal objective. Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice emphasizing political freedom voluntary association and the primacy of individual judgment.Conservatism Conservatism as a political and social philosophy promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of culture and civilization. Some conservatives seek to preserve things as they are emphasizing stability and continuity while others called reactionaries oppose modernism and seek a return to the way things were.Both Liberal and Libertarians seek liberty. You can redefine them however you would like but that is again not useful in a conversation to arbitrarily define words. I would say conservatism is the opposite of liberal sometimes but if we reached liberty any drift away would be illiberal but not conservative liberal and conservatism would be the same. So calling someone illiberal as conservative isnt accurate and obfuscates the whole thing.,SargonofAkkad,d0nk5nw,1,t5_38l30

The term regressive left can be used as a pejorative like the term neocon is to discredit someone. That although doesnt mean we should just disregard the term.gt It is used to smear all liberals based on the actions of a few.The term is used predominately by liberals to differentiate themselves from a segment of the left that dont share the same beliefs around core liberal ideals. I think a good description of the regressive left wold beThe regressive left is a political epithet used to characterize a section of leftists whom are politically regressive by tolerating illiberal principles and ideology for the sake of political correctness.Who is actually classified as a member of the regressive left is a matter of perspective and debate. I believe the real problem with this section of the left is that  too tolerate of completely illiberal principles and ideologies for the sake of political correctness. Some of the best examples of this could be seen during the charlie hebdo massacre or the cologne attacks where the regressive left engaged in some really despicable victim blaming.gt I can think of no examples that would fit the supposed definition of the regressive left.I used to watch the TYT religiously until they started going off the rails to become the Fox news of the left wing. Specifically to answer your question I would argue that TYT engages in race baiting reporting narrative over facts and applying double standards. We can go back and forth arguing about examples but it serves no purpose.gt Sam Harriss foreign policies are neo conservative and he defends Western imperialism. Chomsky humiliated him in their public dispute.I have followed and read Chomsky for many years since university and would in most cases side with his analysis on foreign policy over Sam Harris. Although there is some validity to Sams claims. Chomsky does have a tendency to implore double standards on ethics of American foreign policy. I would also agree with Sams argument that you need to take into account the intentions of the actors in international politics just as much as the end result. I dont think you can apply the label of a neoconservative to Sam Harris. He labels himself as a liberal and has critique the failings of the neocon philosophy on foreign policy.gt Western imperialismI have a lot of problems with this term. Its a over simplification of what is actually going on in today. gt I think you just dont like them and so you smear them with this ad hom attack of yours. Or maybe you have a thing for Ana and in typical MRA form you lash out at her.You are presuming a lot here. Ana Kasparian is probably the only thing good about the TYT.

On the other hand nonGM foods e.g. grains can be routinely mixed with GM grains because there is no reason out side of exports to not do that. There is no certified GM free commercial program.

Its not Ben Shapiros rhetorical probing that you should test the ideological extremes like if youre supporting open immigration then you should be in favor of completely open borders in order to either expose your debate opponent as an ideological extremist or to expose a contradiction in this case that they want closed borders and to then they get to arbitrarily decide how far to open it when the counter argument tends to be Youre antiimmigrant or such thing. You spoke earlier about a hypocritical Republican position then Id propose that you consider that Molyneux if he were committed to being a true anarchist and believes that the state is by its nature oppressive and tyrannical should either protest paying taxes because that would then be supporting a tyrannical and oppressive system which he refuses to do or see if he can find a place that has either less taxation Which Molyneux declared is extortion by death threats of the government demanding money or itll send government agents to murder him or no government at all such as in the wilderness.I have a difficult time reconciling that he encourages other people to do things that appear to be harmful like DeFooing or whatever its spelled or things that hes not willing to do himself with the fact that I should then take his ideas on board with other aspects of my personal opinions.

All of these involve oneonone targets maybe a few more targets in home invasion. Only a minuscule percent of gun owners want to cause widespread damage so why he is trying to use WMDs as an argument against guns is beyond me.

8104579,0,t1_d4qsygj,You are correct on all points. The reason Texas would want to secede is to be free from a Tyrannical Administration. For example the Obama Administration has steadily abused its power to force political and social change. In the Constitution the states were supposed to pass laws that congress is unable to. If Congress is unable to pass a law it means that the law in question is not supported by a majority of the citizens therefore it becomes the responsibility of the state to pass laws at a regional level in order to reflect the will of the population. Texans like most Americans before progressive indoctrination abhor the thought of having a king who wields full authority over all aspects of an individuals life. The Obama admin as well as any Hillary Sanders admin will push the US further and further away from a Constitutional Republic and more toward a Social dictatorship. In light of that as you say Texass own government was setup in resemblance of the original US Texas firmly believes THE TEXAS CONSTITUTIONARTICLE . BILL OF RIGHTSThat the general great and essential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and established we declareSec. .  FREEDOM AND SOVEREIGNTY OF STATE.  Texas is a free and independent State subject only to the Constitution of the United States and the maintenance of our free institutions and the perpetuity of the Union depend upon the preservation of the right of local selfgovernment unimpaired to all the States. Sec. .  INHERENT POLITICAL POWER REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT.  All political power is inherent in the people and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit.  The faith of the people of Texas stands pledged to the preservation of a republican form of government and subject to this limitation only they have at all times the inalienable right to alter reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think expedient.So it is keeping with maintaining the integrity of democracy and  freedom not because of a longing for a past state of being. There is a culture here that loves freedom and reminiscent of the old ways of America where personal freedom was valued above all else. The US is moving away from that. And if the US or Texas constitution is to be believed the people have a right to change their government if it no longer serves to advance their will.The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of AmericaWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Natures God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security.Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain insert Obama or Facist Administrations is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.EditSpelling,SargonofAkkad,d4r0zu5,1,t5_38l30

8261710,0,t1_d5a4clq,Its rather a mixed bag the way our Constitution is set up.  Ill simplify it by saying there is probably no single person who understands all of the States various firearms laws including legislators lobbyists and attorneys who specialize in firearms.  It really is that much of a cluster fuck.Federally there is no training requirement.  Handguns require a clean record read not convicted of felony or certain crimes which would otherwise render one ineligible to purchase with NICS background check and special weapons have further restrictions amp taxes as set by our Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.  Aside from the things already mentioned the Federal government leaves the rest up to the States.Statetostate legislation varies greatly.  A few states are rather draconian in strictness others are very lax and most are somewhere in the middle.  Where Im at in Virginia I have the waltz in and buy option.  Across the river in Maryland the requirements are more strict.  In nearby Washington DC there is actually only a single gun shop with a single Federal Firearms Licensee which is a license required to transfersell any Federallyrestricted firearms  this makes it nearly a de facto firearms ban.No one disagrees that we should all handle all firearms in a safe responsible manner.  Where the massive disagreements lie is in how this should be implemented.  Many believe it should be the responsibility of the State or Federal govts to put laws into effect to curb firearms access amp usage in various ways.  I personally lean heavily towards the rights of the individual to make those decisions even if it means we have higher risk of incidents  its a trade off Im willing to accept.Furthermore we cant even properly enforce the laws we already have...making more unenforceable or poorly enforced laws seems rather silly until we can at least determine if what we have on the books can be effective in the first place.Unfortunately theres no single right answer and no other countrys gun control implementation would necessarily work for the US.,SargonofAkkad,d5a9soi,1,t5_38l30

In the states filing a false report with police is intself a criminal act. But these people just go on with their lives as normal after ruining someone elses.There is also the presumption of guilt rather than innocence against the accussed. I thought it was innocent until proven otherwise. Isnt that a violation of ethics? Or simply stacking the deck against the man? The legal system does everything it can to protect innocence in every other situation. It is the reason that some trials take so long. So as to avoid giving out a damning verdict at almost any cost.Of course the guilty could potentially get away but isnt the innocence of a young man who has so much to offer society worthy of protection?

Turns out literally anyone can apply for asylum and it takes a minimum of  months in which time they receive welfare. When rejected they just renew the application. There is literally no limit whatsoever for who or how many or how often can apply hence the current disaster. This is the only way non citizens can get welfare I think EU citizens can but thats a different story. I think changing the asylum law would solve a lot of the problems.

9841396,0,t1_daqbabd,gt His video is up BTW and I watched it. I guess she still is right and Noah is wrong but neither did a good job.Id agree with this conclusion.gtWhen he said a minority generally doesnt represent a whole movement hes right but she didnt say exactly why he could be wrong. Yeah she didnt attack this point hard enough. She shouldve driven home that a political movement is defined by the actions of its supporters and constituents. But she let Noah control the flow of conversation which was her first mistake.gtI find this in many speakers and thinkers online and i and many probably certainly didnt find it with her here.I wouldnt say she was dishonest or anything. But she was definitely lowhanging fruit. Which is exactly why Noah Trevor picked her to interview heres someone that they can portray as the opposition to BLM and all of their fans and the leftists who wish to be in an echo chamber can pretend shes the mainstream voice of their opponents. That she is not lowhanging fruit but someone with the best arguments their opponents can make. Thus Noah can easily make her look bad or like a horrible person making everyone more affirmed in their belief that BLM is a great noble movement that does no wrong and everyone who doesnt like it is just a racist or bigot. It didnt work nearly as well as Noah would have wanted I am sure but the result is clear. This is why I believe she was chosen to represent antiBLM people and why most of us agree she didnt have a solid argumentviewpoint.gtI personally think BLM is illegitimate just because it is so disorganized.I think its illegitimate because it has basically devolved into a KKKesque group but the main reason why it has become this is because the media keeps pretending theyre noble and goodhearted which allows them to continuously push the boundaries of what they can do.gtthe actual diversity and confusion within the movement and what its about speaks to its invalidity.True its pretty disorganized and theyve even changed their demands online several times. But the components of it still speaks volumes let alone that the leaders and MSM never condemn violent behavior and they uphold a black supremacist who is on the FBIs most wanted list as their idol.gtIts terrible that BLM is the most forefront push to help blacksIts not about helping blacks though. It never was BLM started when people started talking about police brutality. I remember it quite well when the conversation changed from police brutality in general into police brutality against black men specifically. They took over the conversation and made it about them only. It doesnt seem like it now because it was quick and they were thorough in controlling the conversation in MSM and the internet. It started off selfishly and it was all about sociopolitical power from the beginning its all a powerplay.gtSo I think I will be able to accept the possibility that BLM actually stands for bad things but its so disorganized not even their followers or maybe even the media realize it.I dont know about this I imagine a lot in media understand the severity of BLM but someone or people up high want the story to be different for one reason or another.gt That interview was terrible unfair and exactly the type of content that will further a divide.

No. Unless you are one of those Oh shit its snowing global warming must be a lie . gtThats exactly what it is. That is why I am so skeptical. It is ideological and political up the yin yang.science isnt decided through political debates nor by politicians but by scientists through scientific method. Someone else can try and debunk it or present a different theory or different evidence that contradicts it either way it isnt happening here in this case. I hope you know how peerreview works scientists arent shouting at each other to prove a theory. Validity of science is not up to politicians politicians may deny it or may not act based on science though because politics and selfinterest.There is a political argument between people who accept and understand what scientists are saying and those who reject it put thumbs in their ears and are antiscience. gtThat isnt objective. They clearly have an agenda. I cant take their ideological bias as gospel.Thats just completely dishonest of you. It is a baseless assumption. The way you are doing this you could dismiss and reject any information on any site it makes no sense. Putting head in the sand or plugging your ears cant be more accurate analogy here. It is very intellectually dishonest. thats just ideological bias you can say that to anything you have decided to reject.  It is by very definition independent and never brings up political ideologies anywhere on their site its not even allowed to talk about in comments it has great quality control. It scientifically and methodically explains things and debunks myths presents evidence shows references etc etc etc.gtUntil it has been proven to me.well arent you a special snowflake...WIth your mindset it just impossible to prove it to you im not sure you will accept it when your streets are flooded and its  degrees warmer than usual I exaggerate ofcourse.   was warmest year ever recorded btw.gtWhere can I see that hard evidence?sigh.... You can do the same experiments other scientists have done. Guess you can go measure sea levels temperature ocean aciditywiki mass of glaciers look at satellite data and more.gtFunny because I am definitely not conservative.And yet you seem to think like one you give me the same nonsense as conservatives same denialism and you share some of their ideology. Conservatives is the only major political party in the world that denies climate science. And well you are even more definitely not a liberal. Though if you follow Sargon maybe youve come to agree with some of his more liberal views.gtI demand evidence.There are numerous good scientific sources like NASA realclimatewww.realclimate.com videos and others I gave you the best one most independent and with most detail and information. And your reaction is something like thisSo far it seems youve just been fed misinformation or only listened to people on the internet and political debates.gthave looked and dont understand gtsounds like  how very scientific and objective.  There is no either side seriously.  There is no respectable scientist at all that disagrees with the consensus scientific community on climate change there is no scientist that has provided any good science against it.And dont embarrass yourself by linking to some scientist that takes money from fossil fuel industry to spread misinformation  has been thoroughly debunked and discredited by scientific community. Thats not ideology speaking those are facts. Some of these guys did the same thing for tobacco industry spreading misinformation about it and skepticism of health risks from smoking.Most of scientists here fall into that category and you can examine their arguments and why they are false. gtWait say that again. I didnt have my tin foil hat on.no its far from conspiracy. Its a fact that ExxonMobil koch brothers wilkis brothers etc have sponsored people and campaigns to spread misinformation and doubt on climate change because they are affected by regulations and they dont want the world to move away from fossil fuels. Its not difficult to follow the money you know. That isnt information that is too difficult to find it isnt speculation. I mean you can mention any of them ill point you to some sources like say this guy  This also is not a conspiracy.  its the reality. They arent philanthropists you know.But I wonder is there ANY prominent scientist whose views or opinions you respect? Because I can guarantee you that he isnt skeptical of climate change and science he understands it and accepts it because he knows how science works and likely better than you. Richard Dawkins perhaps? Sam harris? Lawrence Krauss? Thunderft? Or are you an antiintellectual who doesnt trust bobbleheads ? gtAppeal to authority much?Yes? Because i think thats the only thing that might work on you. Now you have a guy who isnt denialist on your side .  gtAgain dont care WHO is or WHO isnt what. That isnt part of what interests me.Umm why not? This was Trumps pick and you support Trump why would you not care what kind of guy is the secretary of state and climate? Thats pretty big deal. Personally not fan of CEO of ExxonMobil having a post. Obviously he isnt really fit for the job Trump picks billionaires and millionaires who sponsored him for various posts. He is in bed with fossil fuel.  gtAnd he is alarmist. I mean your whatever? Is that cognitive dissonance? If he is looking out for them then do they see money in alarmism? Hmmm. But it totally isnt political. And the oil companies found a way to profit and now support it but that is totally evidence I can rely on.No you misunderstood me. I was saying is  that  he believes in science but I doubt he is actually gonna advocate to do anything about it he still cares about his company and his interests money. They will still repeal obamas regulations and profit from it regardless of what harm it may cause to environment or planet.  The only way fossil fuel industry can profit from accepting climate change is by investing money in notoil like renewable energy.But he does support CO tax or so Ive heard which is why Elon Musk supported him.I wonder what if there comes a point where you would just have to accept it and evidence is convincing enough. Will you say you were wrong and those people werent alarmists after all? Will you blame people to not be able to communicate information well enough for you to understand it? you arent making it easy  Or are you not even entertaining the possibility that it could all be true?  gtIs this some attempt at futility for you as well? yeah... but i have small hope that there might be someone who can look at the information and cut through misinformation and accept the reality despite having an opposing view. ,SargonofAkkad,dey0tip,1,t5_38l30

11225089,0,t1_df4c508,Youre right its ludicrous to enforce laws and trying to stop people from enforcing them. There is no SJW boogeyman it is literally all around. All over my social media most major celebrities artists and actors the mainstream news media all push the same narrative. Just because Islam isnt going to take over the west anytime soon doesnt mean its not a threat. Erdogan just recently said that he wanted Muslim Turks living in other parts of Europe to have more children because they were the future of Europe and he wants them to spread. Theres many Muslims who outright state they wish to take over the west. It is in their holy book. The thing is countries that are majority atheist agnostic sihk buddhist hindu jewish christian generally do not treat those following other religions as inferior peoples. Those religions do not have an end goal of conquering everyone and taking over the world. Muslims are treated equally to other religions in western countries. But in Muslim majority countries Christians and atheists are executed. Muslim birth rates are the highest of any religion. I agree that I dont see it happening at least in America but it could very well happen in Europe if people do not elect politicians who will do something about it. If Hillary was elected and millions of migrants were being brought into America I would say there is a real worry. Things can change quite quickly.,SargonofAkkad,df4clqg,2,t5_38l30
