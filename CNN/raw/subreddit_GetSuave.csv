5589839,0,t3_3ro4o7,What a nice read! Its a good cheat sheet to be suavier. Ive been guilty of  a great part of my life. gt Consider asking people out in person like lifting weights it isnt easy but its the only way to make you stronger.That part was what I needed as of right now. Ill make it an objective for the next week. ,GetSuave,cwpz01g,1,t5_379ez
5785612,0,t1_cxe5c8b,Its difficult letting go of a close friend especially one that knows you well. Thank you for being honest. Ever since she called me I havent quite been sure if its a good  idea to even just be friends. I had finally moved on about a month ago. I think youre right in that it would be best to just let her  go. ,GetSuave,cxe9dt3,2,t5_379ez

7056173,0,t3_4bxajt,That sounds a bit too excessive.I mean its good to have some tools to help you in certain social situations. For example Ive written down the birthdays of my family members close friends and coworkers in a notebook and I check it every once in a while to make sure I dont forget to wish them happy birthday andor get them a small present. For other people I may know I rely on Facebooks notifications and sometimes my rather bad memory. That kind of stuff I can understand.But frankly you dont need to outsource all your networking to technology. Youre not a robot like Data from Star Trek.Do you really need a way to visualize the strength of a relationship with someone? Just look at their face. If you dont have prosopagnosia you should be able to recall if theyre a friend an acquaintance a work contact etc. Knowing a lot of people would not be an excuse this time because you should be able to remember how important a person is to you. Same thing applies to a way to have an overview of the needs and talents of the people in my social circle so I can better act as a matchmaker. Dude youre not playing The Sims. You dont need graphs to see how well your relationship with other people is going and if theyre part of your social circle you should have a small idea of what theyre good at. And you dont certainly need to act as a matchmaker that sounds borderline creepy.You mentioned that companies use similar methods. But theyre companies. Clusters of people whose relationships to other companies revolve around complex business situations. For those things you actually need an analytical frame of mind data sheets and written contact information. For everyday life not so much.The whole point of social contact is human interaction for one purpose or another. If you try to force it like that it will come off as unnatural and offputting. Although I dont think anyone would judge you for having such apps in your phone I agree with the other poster that you should go by feel. Its more normal natural and will come off as more genuine.,GetSuave,d1g6cyt,2,t5_379ez
7387750,0,t3_4ghdkg,Relevant study Its up to you Experimentally manipulated autonomy support for prosocial behavior improves wellbeing in two cultures over six weeks.Abstract Previous research has demonstrated a strong link between prosocial behavior  particularly autonomous prosocial behavior  and wellbeing. Little is known however about whether and how autonomy might be boosted in the context of everyday kindnesses. We tested the effect of supporting students autonomy on wellbeing gains from practicing acts of kindness in a sixweek randomized experimental study in the United States and South Korea. As predicted performing kind acts while receiving autonomy support led to greater improvements in wellbeing than performing kind acts without autonomy support or engaging in comparison activities i.e. focusing on ones academic work with or without autonomy support. Notably these wellbeing improvements were mediated by feelings of autonomy competence and relatedness. The current study is one of the first to demonstrate the causal effect of autonomous prosocial behavior on wellbeing as well as the psychological mechanism i.e. need satisfaction explaining this effect.This gist of this and related studies is that being kind to others makes you happy. This is especially true when you choose how you will be kind rather than doing kindness because its expected of you. In other words those newage hippy bumper stickers saying Practice Random Acts of Kindness are actually scientifically sound. ,GetSuave,d2hxq6g,3,t5_379ez

8326661,0,t1_d5gnnbr,Alright thanks! I was really kinda against consistently shaving it and going clean for  main reasons.  I think I look better with what little facial hair I have and  a hostess tried seating me at the bar at a restraunt the other day due to my beard and about pissed herself when she found out I was  and not  hah xD but Ill keep it shorter than usual from now on.And about the ring I agree I think its fine to wear and probably will wear it.

9716015,0,t3_5e5plz,This post is super stereotypical for a frat guy lol. No offense man but i mean its like you talk about how you basically just dont want to work hard except on partying and meeting girls. Theres nothing wrong with partying and theres definitely nothing wrong with meeting girls but youve got an extremely short term solution for meeting girls. You might have a decent shot with some sorority girls right now while you have daddys credit card and live at the frat house but when you graduate college and trust me that shit goes by really fast the high quality girls want a guy who has his shit together. They want a dude who isnt living on his parents credit card. ampnbspHaha honestly Work put in  fun gotten out?? Dude you act like its all about fun. You act like work ends as soon as youre out of college. LOL dude you will be working until the day you die. There is so much more to life than fun and partying. There is discipline there is hard work there is fulfillment. There is actually meeting and attracting beautiful women which is WAY fucking harder in real life when you dont live in the frat house or in college where youre literally surrounded by girls all day. Im sure youll get really good at getting fucked up but trust me you wont get good at meeting girls. ampnbspProblem is life has obviously been way too easy for you. When i was a kid i used to envy my rich friends. They never had to work during highschool they always had nice new cars and the latest video game system. But then i realized that learning to work is way more important. Learning discipline is one of the best things possible. Yeah sure sometimes work and discipline sucks. Thats literally the point. Youre doing something you dont want to do so that later you CAN do what you want to do. Again you may think going out and meeting girls is easy right now but if you want to actually get good at it and meet the stunners youll have to put in real work and become a real man. A real man has discipline and can work his ass off. ampnbspMy advice develop discipline. Quit making excuses for yourself. Choose something and stick to it. Start working on something every single day ESPECIALLY on the days that you dont want to. If you like meeting girls see if you can cold approach  girl a day on campus sober for  days straight. If you like meeing girls so much lets see how bad you really want it. Best of luck bro. ,GetSuave,daapjx9,1,t5_379ez
9955308,0,t3_5i1xhm,You have a few things going on.  You have a job at a company that has actual holiday parties.  Thats big because it puts you in what is effectively a different stage of life than your peers.  That makes it hard to fit in with people your age and easier with others who work at your company.  I assume the people youre able to talk to are in their twenties?  Thats a generally chill age anyway.  People that age dont really care that youre younger if you are able to talk at their level and dont cause drama.  Also they know where they stand with you.  Youre likely in a company with some sort of structure so everyone already knows where everyone else is in the hierarchy  theres no jostling for position at a holiday party.  Making a scene there is bad for your career as well as personal life.Good on you for being able to keep up with the big kids.  Now for getting on with people your age  follow the advice of this sub be the party you have a job use some of that money to help your friends have fun dont judge people your age harshly if theyre not at your stage in life and if someone challenges you remember who you are and what youve accomplished itll help you keep your frame.,GetSuave,db579pn,7,t5_379ez
