9602988,0,t3_5chk0m,I like this. I think it is important to convey that were all in this together. It is a weird thing to take responsibility for something and say sorry. It doesnt always mean you are sorry for trying it can also mean that you are sorry that this person is going through this difficulty. It also can convey that youre trying.I like Im sorry I know this is hard. Id like to help you. Can you tell me what would work for you? or something similar.What works best? How do you usually do this? Have you had someone help you in a way that is better for you? Tell me how they do that.,CareAides,d9wrjg1,1,t5_3hhh5
