The pacing the story everything.Do a Lambda Run where you find all the lambda tags around the world  youll be surprised just how much detail is put on the textures in places you would never even think to look.If I played this game every day  the replay value would diminish even skyrim and fallout can get old if you play it EVERY DAY but for me this sort of  November Journey that I do makes the game very enjoyable and something I always look forward to.,HalfLife,cgden0r,1,t5_2rgym

904308,0,t3_24gp20,It does get fairly tiresome after a while yes and that aspect of the games could definitely have been improved. I find that it helps to remember why they did it since Gordon doesnt have any of his own character his character needs to be established by the way others around him interact with him. Also it seems that due to the added time constraints theyd put on themselves with the episodic model the overall game quality is a little lower. Its not an excuse but it is an explanation.Thats also part of why they introduced Magnusson in EP because they needed someone to fill the asshole role.I also find it helps to do a little Freemans Mindesque dialogue. For instance in EP I was beginning to think youd forgotten about me! Who me? Go off and forget about someone close to me? Never! Considering that at the beginning of HL you do precisely that to that guy who turns out to be Eli So much for medical supplies. I found a shotgun! Hey so did I! Only like three hours ago. Hey that wasnt so bad! We should have brought everyone over at once! You think I want to deal with  AI squad members at once? Do you think Im some kind of masochist? A little help here Freeman?! What the hell are you talking about? We havent even left yet! random rebel in the bit right after you escape the tunnels First the Combine and now this... I dont like your tone young lady!

2413369,0,t3_2n3eqx,My favourite minor moment is during Highway  when you randomly walk into a building check all the rooms etc find nothing and on the top floor is some supplies behind a rudimentary barricade. Combined with visual clues elsewhere in the building and surrounding area it tells you what happened here and its pretty bleak. The kicker is when you go for the supplies and some roller mines drop through the ceiling. As you run down the stairs they fall through the ceiling directly in front of you clearly a scripted sequence yet still awesome because it feels so natural. I cant find it on Youtube but the way the mines appear as you run gives the sequence a movie like quality but involving you enough in the game to make a fucking awesome slice of gameplay.All around about  minutes of gameplay. See this is why I love this game.Edit Found it although the guy here just kills the mines rather than run like a little bitch like I did.,HalfLife,cma0296,8,t5_2rgym

2686576,0,t1_cn98s42,gt Breen is trying to manipulate Gordon. Hes at his mercy hes going to send away his friends to weaken his resolve and he wants Gordon to know that if he doesnt cooperate hell be a prisoner for ever and the Combine will probably wipe out a lot of humanity. Not only that but hes trying to put a wedge between him and Eli.I cannot tell you how wrong this is. If he was going for financial insentive he would have said something along the lines of I can offer you safety comfort a warm bed all the money you want... But instead he threateningly says Did you know your contract was open to the highest bidder?. Think about that for a while.Also he doesnt want Gordon as a prisoner. None of them do. In fact Breen takes orders from the same people that Gman does people who want to use Gordon. Their Benefactors. And I can prove to you it isnt the Combine. First things first listen to the speech that is the topic of this thread. Dr. Breen references the transhuman combine police force disappointing Dr. Breens Benefactors. And later Even if you offer your surrender now I do not believe our Benefactors would accept it. ...they have begun to look even on me with suspicion.Let me ask you who is Our? As far as we know Dr. Breen is alone in this matter. Besides him the only ones that ever even reference the Benefactors are Eli and GMan. And the only reason Eli knows of the Benefactors is BECAUSE of GMan. Now let me ask you this if the Combine were so suspicious of even Dr. Breen why did they allow him Asylum on their homeworld? Why did Dr. Breen instantly run to the Combine once he was in trouble? If they were suspicious of him they would not have actively helped him escape the planet and have asylum on their own. This further shows that the Benefactors and the Combine are two separate entities.Another piece of damming evidence is how at the beginning of the game Gordon teleports to Dr. Breens office. As soon as Dr. Breen sees Gordon he contacts his extreme Higher Ups. Why? If Gordon was just an Ordinary Man Dr. Breen should have no reason to have such a drive to apprehend him. Breen Knew. There is no denying this.,HalfLife,cn99790,3,t5_2rgym

Eventually ended up playing HL and the episodes and absolutely loved them. Im a huge fan of scifi and I was absolutely blown away from the story.When the orange box was announced later that year I was pissed that I had to get all the other games with it because I just wanted Episode . At the time they were the same price and I figured Id get them all and gift the extra copies to someone. I preordered it and enjoyed the TF beta while I waited.The day the game was set to unlock my PC broke. I was so angry I kicked a hole in the wall mom was not happy about that!. I ended up pulling my graphics card out and putting it in my old PC just to play it. I loved every minute of EP and was so upset at the ending but I was excited because the next episode would come out in a year or two!....That was almost  years ago.  Im still waiting. In that time I learned how to map used to be a pioneer for learning all the new tools and model building but then college came and took all my free time away  I just introduced my boyfriend to HL and he loved it but of course hes upset that it just ends at EP. Hopefully this year well see something. Ive said that every year but the source  stuff has me pumped. In the meantime Ive been playing Black Mesa to go through HL.

5711865,0,t3_3taag3,I dont think HalfLife is either obscure or medicore these days. Honestly in terms of gameplay it still stands up remarkably well.But putting that completely aside the question is whether or not its viablereasonable for Valve to continue building games in the franchise.My thought is that yes it is  however there are some caveats that fans will need to accept and many possibly wont.For one thing Valve need to have genuine creative space with any new HalfLife game. That could mean radical changes to the formula. It could mean that the next game should it ever arrive does not pick up literally a minute after HalfLife  Episode Two left off.My concern is that if Valve feel stuck in terms of needing to fit a certain expectation around the next game that this alone could simply cause the game to never be completed.There is enough distance between Episode Twos release and any potential HalfLife  that I think and hope Valve wouldnt need to be bound so tightly to Episode Twos ending. Maybe. There are also of course a whole new generation of gamers who may not have played HalfLife  and who will need to be introduced to the franchise for the very first time.Even if you think that HalfLife is now obscure youll see that opinion reverse immediately as soon as a new HalfLife game is announced if it were to be. Youll see guaranteed walltowall media coverage in the gaming press. What was possibly obscure will suddenly become massively hyped.,HalfLife,cx542ef,6,t5_2rgym

Some have likened it to the LD spawning system but the only similarity is that its procedural spawning instead of enemies placed directly in the map or with a spawner entity such as pointtemplate or npcmaker.From what Ive seen instead of using external scripts varying the amounts of enemies based on player stats it uses multiple map entities to spawn enemies within a specified volume depending on the properties of its target location and the locations of other spawn volumes.,HalfLife,cxmj659,2,t5_2rgym

6127083,0,t1_cym0dqs,There are several key differences between the companies and their situations though. The existence of Fallout  was never a question. Bethesda makes games thats what they do thats how they survive as a company and fallout is one of their biggest IP. Of course they were going to make fallout . People were angry at them for lack of any news because they were just being impatient. at least Bethesda acknowledged fallouts existence. Valve though doesnt need to make games anymore. So HalfLife  never being made at least by them is a very real possibility. I would rather an awkward were working on it then another five years of silence. They didnt even make a peep on the ten year anniversary of hl. Also HalfLife fans are a bit more deserving of at least a little info. Fallout as a series doesnt have a continuous narrative The last game didnt end on some huge cliffhanger and each game is a huge open world RPG that you can sink hundreds of hours into and play again and again and again. The last full HalfLife game was over ten years ago and the last one in general was  years ago and it was just a small episode. and it ended on a huge cliffhanger. IDK maybe i am biased because i like halflife more but when i would see people complain about no fallout  news before it was announced i would get pretty infuriated. ,HalfLife,cym33ez,33,t5_2rgym

6177042,0,t1_cyri7kw,What we call longlasting just means on the timescale of a couple of minutes. Current predictions show us that without external electromagnetic stabilization M matter will decay within a few femto seconds thus the spacetime discontinuities will also disappear. Creating permanent discontinuities thus also means creating M matter which will not decay. We are not sure if we can do this. There are certainly certain extensions of the field model we use that predict such a behaviour especially if we include tensor interaction terms but we dont know for sure. Why worse than Hitler or Satan? I think the best case scenario is that some alien race will travel among the timelike trajectories invade our planet and enslave humanity making HL happen. Worst case scenario We developed a cheaper or at least faster way to ship cargo around the planet. ,HalfLife,cyrrkix,1,t5_2rgym

Like Marc said the only games that were worth considering as canon were those commissioned by Valve which means probably anything carrying the HalfLife trademark in title by that I mean Gearboxs expansions.When Valve approves a mod they are merely saying that they allow this third party fancreation to be distributed on Steam nothing more. Look at Black Mesa itself which I think would be the best candidate for being Valve canon merely because of the scale and nature of the mod. Valve forced the dev team to remove Source from the name Black Mesa Source hence becoming Black Mesa.

If you like it within the first  minutes buy it.  EDIT Ill add more to this.  Letting loose like you stated is not bad business.  It just means that Valve is comfortable with people taking their assets with approval and making a monetizing product out of it.  Valves game business is not st tier anymore.  If someone decided to take assets from the Steam source code and build a content delivery network based off of that it would be a huge problem.  The fact of the matter is that Half Life doesnt make Valve any money at this point and even if they decided to make a HL the revenue would still dwarve what they bring in with Steam quarterly.  If it doesnt hurt them to have people make a spinoff to the HL franchise then why hold the IP hostage?

This timeline is written with emphasis on Freeman  but I could include Barney and such. I believe Barneys escape to be rather ambiguous as we dont really see the scientists he escaped with  unless we are to assume they were Kleiner Eli and Magnusson  but that hasnt been retconned I dont think.Barney is alive still. Marc confirmed that for me a while back.,HalfLife,d2lr3m4,1,t5_2rgym
7421317,0,t1_d2lfbx8,Thanks I spend a lot of time on this crap!I think the GMan merely needed to prevent the trade of Eli. Primarily because his knowledge alone would gift the Combine with local teleportation. Once Freeman reaches City  he is teleported to Breens office. I think Breen knew that Gordon was the GMans pawn at that point and it sent a very clear message  Breen was screwed.I believe it was the GMans intention to have Gordon cause as much chaos as possible in City  distracting Breen from Eli.So Gordon leads them through the canals to Black Mesa East  and the GMan does nothing to stop him.  The Combine wouldnt have wanted Eli as much as Gordon at that point and couldnt have been swayed into whatever it was Breen wanted to trade them for. Gordon became the bigger prize when he arrived back on the scene.Scanners found the rebels hiding at Black Mesa East and Breen sent in the heavies. The best he could do at that time was secure his bargaining chip Eli until Gordon had been killed or captured. So he locked Eli away in Nova Prospekt.,HalfLife,d2lr7fq,1,t5_2rgym

7613829,0,t1_d37ctxu,I wish that was the only story GTA had.  Instead we have to deal with a bunch of unlikable protagonists that the game assumes we care about but provides no reason to.  At least Tommy Vercetti channels the thoughts of the average player.  Same with the Boss in Saints Row.  Everyone after Vice City was written as an actor that the player guides around not an avatar for the player.  I dont feel like Im Michael Franklin or Trevor.  I feel like Im just steering them through their problems and getting them out of the messes they talk themselves into without my input.  Its such a bizarre choice in an open world sandbox.One of the instances where its really obvious is how Michael is backmailed by the FIB.  Why does this happen?  Why am I as the player beholden to this setup?  Its supposed to be a sandbox right?  Let me kill the guy.  I know thats whats going to happen in the long run anyway.,HalfLife,d37ni9k,4,t5_2rgym

7663482,0,t1_d3d547i,I made a speculative HL development timeline a few months ago. Ill post it here with some minor edits  Development begins soon after the release of Episode .  The game is delayed pushing it past the planned Christmas release date.  Not satisfied with what theyve made so far the team decides that they need to change the game drastically this is probably because the episodes are starting to feel like the same old thing over and over again. So they scrap most of the work theyve done so far and begin to experiment with new concepts.  The team settles on an openworld RPG concept inspired by The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. They begin to flesh out the concept which at this point is still rough. Later they borrow part of the concept to make Stars of Blood a spacethemed RPG that didnt get very far in development before they dropped it.  As they continue to build on the RPG concept the episodic model is dropped so the game is renamed to HL. They plan to have singleplayer and multiplayer modes similar to Portal . The multiplayer mode will most likely be deathmatch.  Source  begins development. The work done so far on HL is ported over. The game is further delayed because they no longer have to work with the limitations of Source  expanding the kinds of features they can implement.  Further development using Source . Development is slow because Source  is WIP and the game itself requires much more work because of its RPG elements. It would make sense if its an openworld game as it would need a ton of work to be put into designing and building locations in order for the game to have depth.Note that years are approximate and the events are based on the little information we know so far. I tried to make as few assumptions as I could in order to make it more accurate.,HalfLife,d3dalr0,56,t5_2rgym

Yeah sure there are enemies that try to kill you but the Xen wildlife is just acting on instinct the Vortigaunts and Grunts are slaves to the Nihilanth and the Nihilanth is just trying to save its people from the Combine and meanwhile the HECU is there on orders from the government which is trying to cover up the disaster to prevent people from panicking.HL though HL has characters and thats more than HL has.,HalfLife,d55zjm4,1,t5_2rgym

Not want to repeat the same stuff again since its gonna be a long comment.Basically RPwise Reddit is very simple to use abeit the way stuff is organized may seem confusing. With time Ive grown fond of it to the point where I would consider it among the best methods of roleplaying aside from visual stuff like games  SAMP or anything like that.At its core this type of roleplaying is focused on narration and is easily highlighted by the followingitalic text for the actions your character does or narrationbrackets for whatever my character saysOOC for things you say in real life out of characterAlthough its not an official rule I encourage people to use it since its easier if we have an universal language.They can be used in a simple or complex way to describe your characters thoughts and motives behind everything he does or just to give a basic image to members of what your character is doing.Example Agt Charles Hemmington kneeled in front of the vent and removed the grating. What was that hed cleared it moments ago. Where was that noise coming from?gt Whatever that was he hoped it wasnt one of the speciments which escaped a few days ago.gt Somethings not quite right here. Call David tell him to come here as soon as possible.gt OOC So hows your wife doing?Example Bgt Charles kneels in front of the vent.gt Somethings not quite right here. Call David tell him to come here as soon as possible.gt OOC So hows your wife doing?If you still arent  clear on this you could try visiting dedicated subs like rHaloRP or rMetroRP starting soon! and just watch things happen.,HalfLife,d76h4c4,2,t5_2rgym

Episode Three comes after Episode Two not HL.I mean just look how good HL was. Why? Because it was fresh and original. Every scene every emotion was shocking exciting or scary.

9840712,0,t1_danidsx,the problem is that halflife had an ambiguous open ending that still wrapped up the conflict of its own story. That created the perfect condition for them to do something completely different with halflife . Halflife  had the same sort of ending and would have been a perfect jumping off point for a completely different halflife . Sadly though that didnt happen and we got a continuation of the halflife  story with the episodes. if they started completely fresh now there would be massive backlash. one of the main reasons fans wanted a hl was to close off the story of hl. I still think it could be possible to do both at the same time perhaps have halflife  be a completely fresh game that reveals what happened after episode  through its lore but there has got to be some closure. the only other way would be to go way back to the drawing board and actually make an episode  to finish the story and release it along with halflife  which would be a completely fresh installment. i dont think that would ever happen but its an option. ,HalfLife,daq9nl5,1,t5_2rgym

9859191,0,t1_dash1py,Its a business their motivations are entirely driven by money.I just never understood the line of reasoning that goes into these responses.  You seriously dont think theres someone at Valve who hasnt just magically forgotten about HalfLifes existence who hasnt brought it up at least once in the past  years?  You seriously dont think that Valve has spent money on market research probably to the tune of tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to find out what they should be dedicating countless hours of research design story creation modeling animating voice acting etc to create a game?  Like they just willy nilly pull an idea out of their ass and instantly dedicate all their resources into creating it?  Businesses do cost analysis on EVERYTHING this is how successful businesses continue to operate and more importantly continue to grow and expand exactly like Valve is doing.  If Valve wants to continue to expand and grow to the point that maybe they can afford the resource drain that is creating a niche game then they need to continue prioritizing their most effective means of making money which isnt going to be some niche game like HalfLife.  But really think about it you might lure in a relative few new gamers who might want to check out the latest game.  And of course youll have the die hard fans like ourselves.  But do you think its going to draw in the type of money that a fastpaced multiplyer FPS which is obviously the current trend in gaming would?  Remove yourself emotionally from this situation and view it objectively.  No its just not.  Its not a smart move for Valve regardless of how you feel about the situation.,HalfLife,dasobzh,4,t5_2rgym

You need people that are good at gaming and understand how to push the boundaries of certain single players FPS standards. Not just technically or story wise. Each encounter with everything whether its a combat encounter or turning a little valve have to be thoroughly thought out and have something about any moment no matter how small or big that makes it different and just not a typical mediocre moment. And Im not saying its impossible but it requires people working hard and sacrificing a lot of time. If it isnt their full time job they cant put forth full creative energy to make the game truly HalfLife worthy.

11082213,0,t1_deo4cci,You seem pretty boring. Not an argument though I know.Life isnt only about money. The work you choose to do or have chosen to do I hope wasnt chosen only on the basis of how much money youre gonna make. Youre supposed to be interested in what you do as your profession.Those  sentences about being financially a failure and hitting rock bottom werent connected. I was trying to say that theyd never hit rock bottom because the ratings were the exact opposite. I just dont believe it to be probable although yeah it could definitely happen. That first sentence in that second paragraph was just lazily writing down thoughts as they came sorry. I think its really unlikely for them to hit rock bottom but its possible. I was trying to say that practice doesnt show very highly rated games being financially unsuccessful so its likely it wouldnt happen although its possible.I am trying to say that if they want to make a new game especially now if theyre rolling in money theyll focus on making a good game because theyre interested in making it because theyre interested in the topic or whatever just not particularly the money. You see if theyve got plenty of money they wouldnt want to make a new game for the money. I understand that. But there are also other reasons for making games.  Why do modders do it for free then? Because they like doing it. Game developers get paid for it but I doubt there are many game developers who dont actually like making games again not for the money though Im sure there are some. In fact there could be many of them but this is just me trying to deduct something from human behavior. People tend to choose professions they like.,HalfLife,deo5qhp,-1,t5_2rgym
