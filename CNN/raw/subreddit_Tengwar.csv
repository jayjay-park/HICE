1893444,0,t1_ckh53ve,The symbol you used anna is the carrier for the ytehta when its at the start of a word just like vowel carrier the bare stem is used for vowels at the start of words. So yonya my son would be written like thisThis page has a very good writeup on the Quenya mode of tengwar.,Tengwar,ckhcmtv,2,t5_2wvc1

4565091,0,t1_ct60nmg,This is awesome thank you so much my plan is to translate and then write it in Tengwar. I just wanted it translated by someone who knows better than I to avoid the hypothetical equivalent of having the symbol for soup in Chinese but honestly believing it means courage or something,Tengwar,ct61luf,1,t5_2wvc1
6000844,0,t1_cy5mpdv,What a shame. It cant be that hard to just make real words. ,Tengwar,cy68ova,1,t5_2wvc1
6619708,0,t1_d03rmt7,Id say its a personal choice at this point. There really is no best way with a name. Although if your brother is not particularly interested in the languages themselves more so simply the Tengwar script then I would probably go with the English mode and choose which looks better to you between English mode and English mode italic.,Tengwar,d0419ie,1,t5_2wvc1
7049848,0,t3_4bpok5,Like Sindarin Quenya has several different modes ways of spelling. This is the correct spelling of the Quenya word voronda in one of them. It is not the classical Quenya mode but it is a Quenya mode that is attested by Tolkien himself in DTS  an inscription of Elendils words when he set foot on Middleearth.,Tengwar,d1fgibx,1,t5_2wvc1
7798034,0,t3_4m354v,This looks about right except for certain places like even or wise where theres a long vowel sound but only a short tehtar is used. Perhaps in those places use a doubled tehtar to show that the reader sound use a long vowel sound. The script is phonetic after all. ,Tengwar,d3sk51z,1,t5_2wvc1
8266499,0,t3_4pc73f,Hey dont know why this got ignored here but this is actually a really interesting phrase to translate. I sent a couple of notes your way on the xpost at rQuenya. ,Tengwar,d5avbt3,2,t5_2wvc1
8316766,0,t3_4tgglx,The st to me has inconsistent tehtar placement and for some reason the page for the nd one wont load for me.I found this one online which looks good.,Tengwar,d5h5hkm,1,t5_2wvc1
