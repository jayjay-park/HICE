My suggestion is to get around on some porters before winter is over I have a list of suggestions though otherwise Stone Imperial Russian Stout Espresso or non very little difference pours black and tastes like chocolate Scaldis Both the traditional Belgian and the Noel are good I prefer the Belgian both are .  Omme Gang Tripel Just came out absolutely delicious much better than Allagash Tripel IMO. Very carbonated Omme Gang Duvel Rustica Seasonal based off of Duvel if you cant find the Omme Gang version Duvel is also a hard hitter. As far as crispiness cant beat Duvel  Hitachino Espresso Stout Personal favorite pricey where Im from  a oz Two Roads White IPA is a good dailysession I suggest it helps me transition from winter stouts to lighter summer beers.If you like crispy carbonation youre gonna want to try anything Belgian from my list the Omme Gang Tripel or the Omme Gang Duvel Rustica or Duvel not by Omme Gang. The stouts I listed are hard to not enjoy though.Cheers ,beer,cew49w7,2,t5_2qhg1

LOOK I BROUGHT RAINBOWS! is a much better way to get the being gay is a small part of who I am but society needs to accept it because its part of who I am and who I love shouldnt affect how Im treated message across.,beer,cg3ukbs,0,t5_2qhg1
560205,0,t1_cg3re93,I dont see this as asking for special treatment I see this as asking for the same treatment. Being gay may have little to do specifically with being Irish but the same could be said for being a policeman or a war veteran. It seems its okay to have a sign for everything under the sun under with the words Im an Irish  as long as the blank isnt the word homosexual.From what I understand theyre not asking to promote marriage equality or any specific legislation and theyre not asking to identify themselves as an organization that lobbies on those issues.Theyre simply asking to identify themselves as LBGT and being explicitly told they cant do so. Thats discrimination plain and simple. Regardless of the organizers intent it sends the message that gays are unwelcome. I think thats wrong however I dont think the law needs to step in here the parade is a private entity. But I do applaud Sam Adams for saying You can have your day but were not going to help pay for it.,beer,cg3y9u6,2,t5_2qhg1

Lately though Im really starting to enjoy easier drinking beer and Urban Chestnut fits the bill while offering lots of different styles like that. I really enjoy the cozy atmosphere of their original brewery and their new brewery is pretty awesome as well.

Most beers that are primarily wheat will be good for you hefeweisen dunkelweisen witbier etc. Consider Hoegaarden or like ukchouichomp suggested Weihenstephaners hefeweisen.You might also be a good candidate for English beer styles. Most English bitters and ESBs extra special bitters like Fullers ESB will be low bitterness but still very balanced. English browns and stouts might be good likewise.

The brewery is fronted by a s diner called Cruisers Cafe.  Good food and great beer.     And last but definitely my biased favorite is Black Bridge Brewery in Kingman AZ.

They show that you can have a greatly hopped up lager Mass Rising that rivals some of the best DIPAs out there and at the same time maintaining that crispness that lagers are coveted for.  I would agree with you if they were going west coast and created hop bomb after hop bomb across the board for all their brews but for many of their selections they DO stay true to form.  You cite the Framinghammer.  It is a Baltic Porter which is of course a lager and his particular selection is a great example of how baltic porters differ from stouts.   The Saxonator is an exquisite dopplebock.  Smoked Marzen is a great rauchbieroctoberfest lager.

1183950,0,t1_ci2srie,Everywhere in Italy is a tourist place but Ive been up and down the country. I saw one artigianale beer the whole time and it was shit when I tasted it. I saw no artigianale beers in Firenze. The one I found was in Como. It tasted like it was trying to be a cross between a belgian trippel and a Budweiser and it was needless to say disgusting.Now I didnt claim that Italy didnt make any good beer at all only that its not known for it and its not particularly common. Sure you can make a comparison to the US and the fact that most bars only sell the big names but most restaurants will have a few of the more successful local microbrews like Anchor Steam and Sierra Nevada on the West coast where I live but I went into a number of restaurants in Italy and the beer they had was Peroni and nothing but. Maybe restaurants in Italy dont tend to serve the variety of beers that American restaurants do?About the palette thing lastly. Im not a hophead. I like a decent IPA occasionally but I dont spend my beer life obsessing over the latest overhopped brew.

1185491,0,t1_ci25asb,The advice he is giving you is not good do not follow it if you paid a lot for a good beer and want to get the most out of it.It might seem to make sense on the surface but no if you transfer your growler fill into a few smaller swing tops and seal them the beer is not going to keep. Youll loose a good deal of your carbonation just in doing the transfer and oxidation will set in quickly.Its one thing if the swing top is what you got initially filled and the fill was done properly. Yes an unopened growler will keep for far longer than most people realize. Months is not out of the question.But if you get a growler fill then transfer that growler fill to other small bottles youre going to get shitty results. You dont want to do that. This advice is bad and you should not follow it if you actually want to preserve your beer.As long as your growler remains unopened it will keep for a good while.

They dont distribute packaged beer and draft is limited outside the brewery but I get there as much as I can. In my opinion theyre the best brewery in NY state.

Each style costs the same to the retailer for a given package and essentially the same to the distributor regardless of the actual cost to produce. Breweries pick that price point to hit their desired blended profit margin.This obviously doesnt hold true for specialty beers with particularly high costs to produce and it is not true for every brewery.,beer,ci7e7li,1,t5_2qhg1

It is impossible for the spreader to have any say or control over how their products are handled or represented outside of their immediate realm of control while the saturators have been able to have tight relationships with business partners and customers in their regions and keep product fresh and keep presentation in line with their image.Perhaps discussing how many Americans believe all GermanDutch beers to be skunked thanks Heineken Green Glass can help your case?,beer,cj32feo,1,t5_2qhg1

1686372,0,t1_cjrmmd9,This is the correct answer here.My big problem with bottles especially bombers is they sit in the fridge right up against the neon light thats enough to skunk em. A lot of people play it down but its true even in brown bottles  minutes is enough. In Australia we get a lot of grey imports or just regular imports of beers so with the added travel and being warm the whole time In summer up to CF a lot of stuff is just oxidized crystal malt and a hint of hop flavour by the time I buy it at an over inflated price. With the sudden increase of cans though they are definitely getting here in a lot better quality than bottles. Hop aroma and flavour is sticking around a lot longer too. BPA is still something I wonder about though those liners do they break down? Have they been tested at all the different PHs of beer to prove there not leaching chemicals in the beer. I can get Rodenbach in the can and it holds up great but I do wonder if that BPA lining is whats giving me tits and not the beer. If only there was some way to get beer in large stainless container that is pressurized and can attach to a pouring mechanism in a social area so people could enjoy beer with their friends. Until someone comes up with a revolutionary idea like that we will all have to keep living in the dark ages of bottles. I guess there is always homebrewing. ,beer,cjrqckc,3,t5_2qhg1

If the water beads the glass is considered unclean you should instead see the water flowing off the surface in sheets.Another way to check post washing is to rinse the glass and sprinkle crystalline sugar or salt on the inside.  If the crystals stick to the sides of the glass its clean.  The crystals wont stick to the glassware if there is residue present.

I was in the right place at the right time befriended and kept bugging the right people. Doesnt hurt that Ive learned as much as possible in the past year to the point that some think Ive been in the business for years.

But there is also a lot of potential a lot of inspiration and a lot of satisfaction to be had.

Hopefully they listen to supply and demand but if they are given other incentives like cash or other perks listed here then they might not  the actual quality of a brewerys beer is pretty much irrelevant to a bar if its not something they emphasize and its generally better for the bar to buy kegs of stuff that they know will sell than to take a risk on a smaller unheard of brewery.Also bars are generally a great way for craft brewers to get exposure in the first place as kegging is way cheaper than bottling or canning.

2131564,0,t3_2jblpu,   First thanks for reading and all of the comments! Yous guys are the people I was most nervous to show it to.  Its unfortunate you guys read it as saying case law eva!. I am in no way okay with these archaic laws. The intention was to state that beer distributors should not be glanced over in this process which is what is happening. If groceries and gas stations were to be allowed to sell six packs distributors would become a thing of the past. Distributors IMO should be given the exclusive ability to sell beer. But they should be given the ability to sell in any quantity the customer desires. Otherwise business owners who have rested their laurels on an industry since generations ago would be out of a job. Do you want places like The Beer Yard to disappear? Because thats how the laws as the LCB and PA Supreme Court want would progress     On the topic of beer codes factually breweries have expiration dates of three to six months. Having worked in a distributor for four years It was my job to rotate. If distributor you go to is not rotating then they are not doing their job. Additionally I like other beer geeks love to visit bottle shops. I will always find old beer. Its not something out of the ordinary. The neglect comes when the business doesnt do anything for the customer. Its a built in cost of the business. If you think people at Wegmans or Whole Foods actually care about the treatment of beer you are sadly mistaken. The amount of times Ive bought light struck beer is annoyingly high. I was at a certain bottle shop in Pittsburgh and found a Double Jack with an expiration from two years ago. I asked for a discount and he scoffed at me and reasoned that the beer was better aged.    Neglect for beer will happen because people dont know their job. Its not a product of the system its a product of the employees.   Again! Thanks again!,beer,claroor,6,t5_2qhg1

The game of distribution does favor those that have the most volume nothing new there. Even in the macro brew world there are struggles to distribute against AB thats one of the major drivers behind the MillerCoors joint venture.One part of Britos game is using volume against suppliers to cut costs. Want hops? Im the largest brewer around supply me those hops at a discount. There are multiple games they play on suppliers to get them to cut costs even going as far as not paying them for  days so AB can earn interest on the money longer. In craft beer you hafta be a little more careful with changing ingredients the drinker is seeking faint aromas as well as flavors. The old adage of you pay for alpha acid doesnt apply because they are now dealing with we pay for alpha and oil. The money saved on GI craft is from brewing at the large breweries. They are very efficient and state of the art. The first year they brewed GI english IPA at one of these facilities they entered it into GABF and won the category. ,beer,cluxmgx,1,t5_2qhg1

The fruit beer comes in larger bottles and is highly recommended and sought after. I for one think everyone should try spotted cow moon man and Strawberry Rhubarb. However over winter there should be some seasonal beers released. most likely Snow shoe ale Cabin fever honey bock and Coffee Stout or Road Slush Stout. these are all good.

Things like beer brewery abv keg date tap date and price should all be there. A good bottle selection is a definite plus. I do like to see a nice selection of glassware for sale not just clunky pint glasses. Any and all things related to beer would be welcomed at my ideal growler shop. Clothes tap handles bottle openers charcuterie selections... so on and so forth. The best advice I can think to give is to look at the other shops in your area and see what it is that they dont have that you think people will want. You need to have that something that will draw people to your store instead of another even if that other store is closer. ,beer,clwqxjy,3,t5_2qhg1

In the middle of nowhere you will find pubs like that but that is simply a matter of logistics. Cask ale begins to deteriorate as soon as you tap and vent it. If you had  cask lines and only a footfall of maybe  people if youre lucky per day that beer will go off. Unfortunately for this country keg beer has a bit of a stigma that is proving difficult to shift. It has begun to change with younger drinkers and the middle class types in the city where drinking craft is seen as a trendy thing to do. The  crowd still have this attitude that keg beer was the domain of the macro breweries pumping out shit like Boddingtongs and John Smiths. Therefore anything that is on keg is shit by association. This simply isnt the case. However this demographic is notoriously difficult to persuade believe me I tried. Their opinion is that keg  shit and nothing is going to change that opinion. Some even go to the extreme and avoid breweries that have keg product. As if that some how compromises their cask output somehow. These people are irrational and stupid however they still make up the majority of people who drink in these out of town pubs with two handpulls if youre lucky with John SmithsCreamflow and a lager line for the missus. Putting an overpriced in comparison to the macro brews craft beer on the keg will go untouched. ,beer,cm7z549,2,t5_2qhg1

2612656,0,t3_2psbhc,Theres not really any good way to prove his theory that the Boomer generation growing old or dying is responsible for the decline in macro brew sales. Thus its a weak argument to support his statement that the decline is not due to craft beer. Also his arguments about growing demographics  specifically Hispanics  gives little support for his statements. Just because Hispanics are growing in numbers doesnt mean other demographics are decreasing. If hes suggesting that other demographics are more inclined to buy Bud or Miller while Hispanics are more likely to buy Modelo or Dos XX then there would an increase in sales of the latter while the former would stay relatively the same according to his logic about demograohics. Reality is that its most likely a combination of all these factors affecting macro brew sales. For instance craft beer popularity doesnt explain the increase in sales for Modelo or Dos XX. But credit needs to be given where due to the growing craft community and not simply dismissed. It may not explain the changes entirely but it definitely has an effect on the market.,beer,cmzm0fe,0,t5_2qhg1

Its pretty common for wine Sommeliers to not smoke or drink coffee ever and not eat strongly flavoured foods garlic onions etc within a couple days or so of tastings.I dont know if theres been any actual scientific studies on it but most of the brewers reps and bartenders I know Im a server at a craft beer bar and I know A LOT of them ahah tend to keep their IPA consumption on the lower end. Same as if you get a tasting flight and the IPA is always recommended to be drunk last. A delicate saison or kolsch tastes like fizzy water after drinking a  IBU beer. Also as a personal anecdote when drinking predominantly IPAsISAsCDAsAPAs I find my ability to pick out more nuanced flavours is lessened. I can drink my favourite local california common after an IPA and taste half of what I can taste in it as when I drink it as my first beer.

2740129,0,t3_2rendl,Part of the problem is that they essentially have only one beerClarified this statement here I mean they dont have to jump on the IPA train but they could be doing a better job growing out from Boston Lager. Wheres their Pilsner their Munich Helles Altbier Kolsch Marzen dont kid yourselves their oktoberfest is garbage maybe a Hoppyred ale a westcoast amber saisons etc??? The big problem is that they only have one real hit beer. Why did they put out a IPA rd voyage with a FG of .? It was a cloying mess.  Rebel is pretty decent  but it seems like a business move not a beer passion move. It is a middleofthe road IPA. Why cant they find that passion for anything beyond Boston Lager?I read the article and I see a Koch facing a BUSINESS problem  I think that denies the reality that there may be a BEER problem. As a craft beer drinker I dont like Sam Adams beer. I have tried and I just dont. Their seasonals are all spiced bullshit their beers and packaging look like they are made to compete with ShocktopBlue Moon. If thats how they are going to cast themselves thats how were going to look at them. gtI dont want to make something if everyone else is doing it Koch says. Its not just business He personally doesnt enjoy many of the flavors in IPAs that todays consumers celebrate dismissing them as catty in nature. I am probably outside the mainstream on that. We dont release a beer unless I like it.I question Jims tastes. I also suspect hes spent way too long drinking his own beer and not enough of what the craft scene has to offer. Im a homebrewer... if I only drank my own I could get lulled into a sense of my beer being the best and nothing living up to that. Fact of the matter is other breweries are making BETTER BEER than Sam Adams. Boston Lager is the class leader in that style though other breweries are probably making better Viennaish lagers. Their Oktoberfest? Try that alongside a Hangar or Karl Strauss Oktoberfest. Hell it isnt even as good as a Gordon Biersch Marzen which is really only mediocre. ,beer,cnfjhmj,7,t5_2qhg1

They all gasped like OH SHIT! YOU CANT DO THAT! NOOOOO!!Ive seen town and county Sunday bans which I guess is somewhat understandable but the statewide limited control on when you can sell alcohol outside of a bar is is just stupid. Meanwhile passengers in your car can have an open container and drink.  Its so ass backwards here.Edit To add to the stupidity I dont know why I can go to a bar in CT and drink until am but I cant go to the grocery store and buy it until they close.  Its like it may come to pm and I want some beer.  The only way to obtain it if my fridge is empty is to go to a bar and drink.  It encourages drunk driving.

This suit is vague and nothing more than a tactic to bully themselves a larger market share.

My favorites have been the ones that use lighter roasts or a blend of roasts for better aroma and use coldbrew methods to keep the bitterness down retaining that the hops are the main bitterness provider.  you wont always find this info easily but if you know coffee youll taste the difference right away.  aging on espresso beans also sounds like a great method but I havent had an opportunity to try that yet.,beer,co5sfw3,2,t5_2qhg1

I apologize for spelling mistakes but English is not my first language.I saw your commercial during Super Bowl and we responded to it in our Facebook page. We have actually never seen you or Carlsberg for that matter as opponents or direct competition. We think your brands are doing a lot of good for our brand and we enjoy the differences in the beer community. But it seems to me that your commercial has changed something and maybe its a good idea that we try to understand each other better?As a result we have decided to invite you to the  Copenhagen Beer Celebration. It is the st and nd of May in Copenhagen and we have invited  other breweries to join. I have attached the list of brewers as an appendix for your information. The concept is simple you bring x different beers  in total. That is two for each of the four sessions. Most brewers bring oneoffs from small batches and a lot of barrel aged stuffs but that is not a rule. The rule is that you have to bring what makes you the most proud and the two of your employees that tells your story the best. However we think that bringing one or two barrel aged versions of you Peach Pumpkin Amber called Elysian would be a big hit herein Europe as it is a style we dont see too often despite its huge popularity in America!You are not allowed to bring banners or any other type of advertising the celebration is about the beery only. We can fix accomodation and there is a big party on Saturday. But you have to buy your own airplane tickets. We have a lot of events going in Copehagen that week so we would also like to invite you to do a tap take over at one of our bars. I can offer you an event where you can present up to  different beers. We will do all we can to present it so that we get a good turn up of Budweizer lovers.I hope you will accept this invitation and join our celebration. I am sure that you will have a very enjoyable weekend.Looking forward to seeing youJacob Gram AlsingOperations Manager,beer,coa38m6,6,t5_2qhg1

These were not easy classes and it was not a good environment to try to get drunk in. Although we were all  at the time what  year old is going to bother with that when at that age we were out drinking several nights a week anyway? Its not like it was hard to get alcohol freshmansophomore year. Come on.To give some context  a tasting was typically four .oz pours although a few lectures had up to six. During this time youre trying to concentrate on what youre experiencing and discuss various aspects of the wine because one youre paying a shitload to take the class and two the classes were not easy. These were not typical blowoff gen eds that STEM majors slept through. Pop quiz is this unlabeled glass of  red a gamay or a nebbiolo? Compare metodo charmat with methode champenoise! Bonus points  name three champagne houses in Reims! It was like intro to chemicalprocess engineering meets intro horticulture meets intro geography. And it took more than studying a textbook to survive  two students in the first wine class actually quit smoking that semester because it was messing with their ability to taste wines accurately.And even if you swallowed everything youre only drinking about a glass and a half or so. And its AM. And youre taking notes that you are then going to be expanding on to pass that section of the exam in two weeks.

In most brewing this would ruin the batch by opening it to contamination in this instance it is precisely what theyre looking for. A good craft alternative to these traditional regional peculiarities are some of the beers made by the Wild Beer Company in Somerset UK. They make a couple of brett beers including an aged one one aged in red wine barrels and a sourdough beer made in partnership with a local bakery. Really exciting stuff. In terms of flavour wild yeast beers can resemble a sharp cider as in alcoholic scrumpy cider not what they call cider in the USA or even a wine. If youd never tasted them before in a blind introduction youd probably be surprised to find they were actually beers. ,beer,cp2bnl8,1,t5_2qhg1

I would drain pour a  month old Pliny before id subject anyone to the taste as thats not what Vinny had in mind when he brewed the beer. Drinking and IPA fresh at the brewery vs taking it home and drinking it a week later there is a noticeable difference in nose and flavor.

With Rose you essentially make a red wine but with the technique of a white wine so you give the juice very little contact with the skins. With orange wine you use white grapes but you leave the skins in with the juice much longer as if you were making a red wine. It results in a orangey colored wine that has the body and tannins of a red wine but from white grapes. Theyre not easy to find and they tend to be very expensive and the wine crowd is mixed about them.

4146419,0,t1_crsn7lj,Local breweries here have no problems getting into accounts bc theyre all with distributors who have ties with big beer.  The distributors are practically giving away the big beer as incentives for buying local craft.  So it can work both ways really.  And of course retailers who buy slow movers are going to be rewarded with the good stuff.  You dont think that would happen if breweries sold directly to retailers?  Its just good business.  To that extent most craft breweries would not be able to afford or have the ability to distribute their stuff directly to retailers.

4208414,0,t1_crzuoxj,Sidebar Trailers for movies have gotten to the point that they actively ruin the moviegoing experience for anyone who wants to be surprised by the content of the film. If youre someone who enjoys experiencing a story as it was designed to be experienced by the writers then youre best avoiding all promotional material.Case in point I saw This Is The End without seeing a single trailer and was genuinely surprised by the apocalypse bit. Sitting in that theater watching the Rapture happen to Seth Rogen in real time without any inclination that the movie was going to be anything more than a Seth Rogen comedy all the information I had going in is one of the greatest moviegoing experiences of my life and it would have been impossible if I had read even the Rotten Tomatoes summary much less watched a trailer.With beer I find that reviews influence my appreciation of a beer only if I like one that is not so highly rated. Unfortunately reading mediocre reviews of a beer that I am enjoying makes me analyze it more critically and oftentimes lessens my enjoyment of said beer. I recognize the pattern and am doing everything I can to prevent it ie not going on beeradvocate as frequently but if Im at a bar with five beers I want to try Im certain to open that bitch up and pick the highest rated one.,beer,crzy40v,3,t5_2qhg1

Tends to be easier if extracts are used as a brewing adjunct but if you were to decarboxylate bud and add it to the fermenter during alcohol production the alcohol would extract the thc and other cannabinoids before filtration to remove the plant matter.

4991566,0,t3_3j4eop,I think most if not all craft beer fans have knowledge of this. It makes more sense to emphasize drinking your hoppy beer sooner rather than later and prioritize putting those beers in the fridge over your nonhoppy beers. A friend of mine bugs the hell out of me for refrigerating some stouts that can easily hold up over time while leaving out IPAs for months.  What Im realizing though is that many dryhopped sours are not meant to be cellared even with bottle conditioning and having plenty of brett.  Iris may improve over time depending on your palate but multiple american wild ales that are dry hopped only seem to become less good over time.  ,beer,cuno4co,1,t5_2qhg1
4997862,0,t1_cuodk4f,Black IPA is the easiest explanation ever its a play on an IPA thats black.  If someone says black berliner weisse I know exactly what to expect and the same is true for an IPA despite the word pale and the crazy people who cant deal with a modulator in front of a standard style name.Porter and stout is largely perception because the ingredients overlap so much partially because a stout comes from stout porter.  Im going to assume were just talking about robust porters here since brown porters are clearly different.  A lot of people will say that roasted barley is the difference but you can make a good porter with roasted barley and a good stout without it.  In general a stout has a heavier bodymouthfeel and a sharper roasty bite.  When formulating a recipe for one or the other thats basically the difference youre shooting for.  Its easier to discuss this with someone who makes beer than it is with someone who drinks beer because its a bit nuanced but generally you either understand the balance between them or know the difference when you drink it and often its just a little bit of both.I dont really get what youre saying about the barleywines that style is often extremely heavily hopped and those are good examples of American Barleywines.  You could make an argument that they straddle the line of imperial IPA and barleywine because again theyre part of the pale ale continuum of bittergtpalegtindiagtIIPAgtbarleywine but theyre so lucious and big and rich that theyre certainly tipped into barleywine territory in my eyes regardless of hop presence which I find to be quite mild and wellbalanced personally.Note how theres no room on the continuum for a triple IPA because where it would be if it did exist is barleywine.

5142538,0,t3_3ledkh,Hello uMyst.  I am here to help. Feel free to PM me for more information. First check out my imcomplete list of breweries in this thread hereYou might also check out this thread for smallunderrated breweriesYour time is limited and we have over  breweries within a  hour drive of Denver.  There are some good breweries on the way to Denver but based on your timeframe I think you could skip most of those. Plus they are closer if when you come back.  In Fort Collins my mustsee breweries are New Belgium Odells and Funkwerks. There are many many others to check out as well. If you have time Mayor of Old Town is a great beer bar but also Black Bottle and Horse and Dragon are cool. The nice thing about Fort Collins is if you get a hotel in the right place you can walk to  breweries and walk back.  In addition Avery is a mustsee Boulder. If you go to one place in Colorado go to Avery. Longmost is also host to Oskar Blues and Left Hand both of which I like.    In Denver I really like Great Divide and I recommend that to anyone. Epic is great but you have Epic in Utah so you can probably skip that. I love Crooked Stave. I love Odyssey in Arvada as well. There are a ton of great places and you cant go wrong.    If you are all about the beer there are a couple places I would definately skip if you have limited time. That would be Breckenridge Brewery cool place to hang but beers arent stellar and Dry Dock good beers but a little outside of denver.,beer,cv5v8yz,3,t5_2qhg1

5151167,0,t3_3lhym9,Guinness is doing what the market dictates for them. Back in the day the solution to Guinness Draught numbers are down was to sell more Guinness Draught. Now the entire industry has changed and if numbers start going down for a product it is nearly impossible to get them back so you have to supplement your numbers with a new innovation. This could be a new variety pack a new seasonal a new packaging change  pack cans instead of pk bottles or a new product completely. Guinness has done all of those and their numbers show it. New flavors for Smirnoff Ice packaging changes for Harp Black and Blonde pks Smirnoff Ice seasonal variety packs Guinness Black Lager Guinness Blonde Guinness Nitro IPA...these all add up.It probably wont be your favorite beer. Black Lager and American blonde probably arent either. But you probably tried them and youll probably try this one. And so will all of your beerdrinking untappd gottatryemall friends in the beer community myself included and it will stick with some of them. Those are all plus numbers. And when you add up all of those plus numbers across the country it adds up to a lot of money.,beer,cv6wq0e,6,t5_2qhg1

5354174,0,t1_cvvtbt3,But plenty of great beers from highly regarded craft breweries use corn or corn syrup along with barley and wheat malt in their ingredients. Corn isnt selected by micros or macros because of its cost but rather because of how it contributes to the final products taste as intended by the brewer. Corn can be used along with barley and wheat malt for a variety of reasons but a couple examples include drying out the finish or adding the right balance of sweetness. Macros use mostly rice and corn as their starches because they dont produce a beer with a heavy malt presence because thats what their beers taste profile is intended to taste like and what Bud light Budweiser Coors light etc. drinkers want. Better is subjective as each individual beer drinker defines what they consider to be better beer or what a good beer is to them. Macro Americal lagers and light beers dont have flaws or off flavors in terms of criteria used to judge beer so you cant ask them to make their beer better. What were youre really talking about is wanting them to produce more flavorful beers but thats not what their flagship brands are built on so theyre answering our demands through acquisition of micros with brands that offer much more flavorful choices. Its like asking Chevy to add the same base and upgradable luxury features found in Mercedes and BMW to their cars. GM may add some options as upgrades in the Chevy line but most would never be standard because the Chevy brand isnt designed to compete for the same customers that are purchasing luxury imports. Instead they add these features as standard in their Cadillac brand because its intended to compete for these types of customers. ,beer,cvw2188,1,t5_2qhg1

5426348,0,t3_3p74jn,the flagship beer same name as the brewery would basically be a slightly higher in SRM version of a cloudy hop juice IPA ala heady or lunch. not a black IPA not even quite a brown IPA  an amber I guess but with the juicy hop profile of these beers. Id try to do whatever it is Ballast Point does with Calico how the yeast adds the body to the beer. Not too high in alcohol though probably about  ..Almond Joy Stout. Ive always wanted to try this. A dry stout in the . abv range with chocolate coconut and peanut butter powder. I havent had a beer with as much nuttiness as the peanut butter beers Ive had  but almond joy stout is a better gimmick. Call it Joy of Almonds stout maybe. To be served on nitro wherever possible.A dry Tripel I find many to be too sweet that rotates with seasonal fruits. Pineapples strawberries blueberries watermelons  I dont see why anything thats been tried in a hefeweizen couldnt work in a Tripel assuming it was done right. The winter beer would be a doppelbock that could have spiced variations depending on time of year.

Employers at that time were often leading advocates of the temperance movement because they wanted workers to be drinking less. Through the s workers often took multiple drinking breaks during the day and often drank far too much to be as productive as employers wanted. Both they and social reformers constantly railed against the deleterious effects of alcohol as making men useless lethargic wastes of space who couldnt provide for themselves of their families. Ive never seen a counterargument from the era that claimed alcohol was necessary to fully energize the workforce. Usually those arguments revolved around cultural traditions usually from immigrants claims that temperance violated constitutional rights or that alcohol had health benefits like I said though never seen this associated with energy or work ethic.Thanks in part to increased beer consumption vs. spirits increased immigrant populations and the rollback of prohibition efforts through the s the shortlived Maine Laws per capita alcohol consumption rose again by the start of the s but with a few noted changes. Drinking was more maledominated more public and more recreational than ever before. Americans loved to drink sure but if anything alcohol consumption was being divorced from work.,beer,cxl9jse,3,t5_2qhg1

6012555,0,t1_cy77rw4,I dont see why this seems like such an obvious conclusion. Yes business have to make money to exist but I dont see how that means business exist to make money.  I see it like a hierarchy of needs. Yes I absolutely have to eat every day or I will die but I dont think many people would comfortably accept that they exist to eat.  We feel fine saying that a company is successful because for a long amount of time they have been profitable.  But if I told you that someone was successful simply because they had managed to find breathable air and sustenance for several decades how impressed would you be?I didnt read the article it seems from the reactions here that it was pretty whiney and not very insightful. But I think that the language the brewers use is a large part of the reason why there is such large backlash.  Microbreweries from my experience anyway pretty much ubiquitously state that they are in the business because they love beer etc.  Of course few companies say they are in it for the money.  I am sure WalMarts public corporate philosophy is not Make fucking money I think this also says a lot about our intuitive belief that companies do not exist primarily as money make institutions.  But I think we all know that the rhetoric of passion and dedication to craft is much stronger among microbreweries than elsewhere. So when it turns out to primarily be about money people are going to feel particularly lied to and particularly upset about that. But I am pretty young and not an economist or social scientist so there very well could be a something inherent to the connection that I am missing. ,beer,cy7rwam,2,t5_2qhg1
6016642,0,t1_cy7hksc,He retweeted this and something similar to it is in the screenshot you postedgt Rather than asking why people care so much about brewery ownership why not ask why people dont care about pizzeria ownership?Who says we dont? I guess Im fortunate to have lots of singlelocation familyowned pizzerias around. They generally make a higherquality product and while theyll never be as cheap as Dominos the value is much higher. Many of these pizzerias have been in business for  years or more and theyre as much a part of their community as any small business can be.Ill still order from Dominos or Pizza Hut occasionally  just like Ill order a Blue Moon or a Leinenkugel occasionally. But Ill always feel better about buying a higher quality product from a smaller local business.From your screenshotgt more than say...pizza wine retail etc.?Id ask this person where theyve been for the last several years of people decrying WalMart for driving out local small businesses and destroying town centers. Or if theyve ever heard of Small Business Saturday Obviously beer people are going to care more about breweries than bakeries but on a large scale I think people do care about those things.There are other factors though. When it comes to restaurants theres a wellestablished balance between local small restaurants and national chains. They coexist and its generally easy to tell whos who. In retail theres a well established imbalance  small shops are slowly dying as they cant compete with the price or the selection of bigbox stores. Thats tough to fight against.Beer is different because the market is changing and changing in a way that supports and promotes the small guy. Everyone loves a story about the small guy succeeding despite the odds. Nobody likes a story about how the small guy cant get his product on store shelves without selling out to the multinational corporations. Supporting small breweries is a way to support those small guy stories.,beer,cy8b3ma,2,t5_2qhg1

Your employer should have no reason or right to stick its nose in your personal affairs outside of work hours whether youre drinking smoking or skiing.

There are a ton of them right here in town and you actually get to experience the whole thing first hand.  You get to see their full at least seasonallycurrent lineup you may see them doing some brewing the place is built with their vibe in mind etc.  A bottle shop is just an inferior encounter. Heres the breweries in town ranked in my approximate opinionFlagship TierFremontHoly MountainGeorgetownExcellent TierReubensStoupTwo BeersUrban FamilyStill Pretty Good TierOutlanderNW PeaksHales AlesSchooner EXACTDisappointing TierPikeHilliards Maritime PacificPyramidElysian is also a brewery that I would formerly place in the flagship beer category.  However they sold to AB InBev so they are no longer really Seattle beer.  Whether or not you visit is up to your personal preference.Here are a few nonSeattle breweries that also deserve special noteBoundary Bay is a brewery in the city of Bellingham a small town close to the Canadian border between Seattle and Vancouver.  Although there are actually a lot of great breweries in Bellingham BB is one of my favorites and their food is to die for.  If you go MAKE SURE YOU GET SOME NACHOS.  Im not fucking kidding.Skookum is a brewery in Arlington a town somewhat northeast of Seattle.  Its a little out of the way but their beer is really damn good.  It also doesnt see a wide distribution so you pretty much have to visit if you want to check them out.Black Raven is a brewery in Redmond.  This is a little less out of the way but still somewhat of a trip.  Its a city northeast of Seattle and is most famous for housing the Microsoft campus.  This beer is good although it is also pretty easy to find in Seattle.  Many other breweries put them on as a guest tap.NoLi is a brewery from Spokane which is the secondlargest and infinitely less famous city in Washington.  However Spokane is right on the states eastern border and is a five hour drive from Seattle.  You will likely never end up there.  But NoLi makes some killer beer and they have great bottle distribution in Seattle.  Maybe grab some to take with you on your way out of town.,beer,czw7069,0,t5_2qhg1

6683692,0,t3_474zyl,I live pretty close by and here are my recommendations Bold  must goWicked Weed and the WW Funkatorium. You need to spend a while here and try their staples Pernicious and Freek of Nature and their sour beers. They are IMO the best brewery in Asheville.Sierra Nevada Its outside of the city about  minutes but it is so worth it. Its incredibly beautiful and its supposed to be nice this weekend so its a perfect place to drink outside. They have a ton of oneoffs and other things you cant get anywhere else. Theres a reason they are so popular.Lunch spot Farmburger is downtown near some of the breweries and is incredible so I would hit that up. Theres a brewery in the basement of Farmburger but I went once and hated it so I never went back. But the atmosphere was really neat at least.Green Man I love this little niche brewery and I think they have consistently some of the best beers. They might not have many varieties and are in the middle of moving into a new space but this is a personal favorite.Burial Burial is a mustgo. They started out as homebrewers in a  gallon bucket and have expanded ever since. Their place is very close to Wicked Weed and Green Man. The Thirsty Monk is a cool bar to check out if you dont want to go to a brewery. Again its downtown and within walking distance of a few other places. They have good bar food as well and have a killer tap list.Asheville Brewing Company is also downtown. I love their pizza and I really love their beer. Its a love or hate place though so its your risky click of the day.Catawba and Twin Leaf are also on the south slope where these other places are and are worth checking out if youre getting bored with the other places.Burial Burial is a mustgo. They started out as homebrewers in a  gallon bucket and have expanded ever since. Their place is very close to Wicked Weed and Green Man. HiWire is close to the others too. Ive never been a big fan of them but if youre close its worth a visit. Seems like others in this thread like them a lot. Wedge They are out of the way but its a really nice place to drink outside. They are next to the White Duck Taco shop which is really popular. They are on the railroad tracks and in a place called the River Arts District. Its a neat little place but again its not near the other places on this list.I would skip Highland. They have good beers but they are out of the way and IMO it would be the last on my list to visit. Oskar Blues has a place right outside of Asheville as well. Ive still not been to it but who doesnt love Pinner and Dales?,beer,d0anhrh,3,t5_2qhg1

6684265,1,t1_d0any6z,gt theres a good debate that can be had from this.No there isnt. Not if the debaters are expecting the debate to have some real world effect. Brewers will keep innovating keep making the best beers they can make at a scale and frequency they can pull off reliably and in ways that make sense for their business some of them will go viral in the geekcloud and people will line up to get these scarce things irrespective of how many pooh poohing articles like this get written by internet scolds. So the whole thing is moot and we could all just breathe that wasted breath into a hot air balloon instead and at least get something pretty out of it.My own dalliance with rare beer lines lasted about an hour and I learned that it wasnt something I wanted to do. Same with trading for rare beers  the effort just didnt seem worth the payoff. Everyone else who lines up will reach their own conclusions on that but conscious not lining up isnt going to be a thing that makes any kind of dent. Like the ocean the lines will instantly fill in the holes left by that minority of objectors. This supply and demand and scarcity thing is already kind of a thing and wont make any exceptions for beer. If the wind goes out of the sails of the whole craft beer explosion and zeitgeist were in and outstanding beers are no longer chased as they currently are then the lines will fade on their own. Until then lines.,beer,d0apml7,1,t5_2qhg1

6900476,0,t3_4a7ueh,Please if you have the curiosity to learn what is going on with beer now do a little research on ABInBev who the people are behind it and what their intentions are with beer both domestically and across the globe. There is a reason why  of the  richest people in Brazil made a fortune off beer.  In the s these men who are not brewers  they are bankers realized they could buy up the brewing capacity in Brazil and have a monopoly.  Since beer has relatively inelastic demand even in the poorest countries people still drink beer if its available they leveraged their enormous economies of scale Brazil is a huge grain producer and jacked up their prices.  With a virtual stranglehold on the market and huge profit margins they created a cash cow that allowed them to go on an acquisition spree once they accumulated a majority of the market share in Brazil.To keep anyone from infringing upon their monopoly they made a ton of restrictive laws making it punitive for any importer to bring their beer into Brazil and virtually impossible for other domestic competitors to start.  With this mountain of cash they went on an acquisition spree across Europe in the s and bought up many cherished wellknown heritage brands such as Hoegaarden Leffe and Stella Artois.  This is when they created InBev as it was formerly known as Ambev after the merger of Brahma and Antartica.Of course they then went on a global spending spree with the top prize coming in  with the purchase of AnheuserBusch at the time the largest corporate acquisition in the history of business not to mention the largest brewer in the most profitable beer market in the world who has a  market share.A few years later they bought Grupo Modelo the maker of Corona Constellation etc.And if you didnt know they are in the process of also acquiring SABMiller.Of course they also bought Goose Island Elysian  Barrel Golden Road Virtue Cider Breckenridge and Four Peaks.  More are on the way.You often will hear Who cares?  As long as the beer tastes good right?Ill let you come to your own conclusion on that.  Just remember that craft beer in the United States which started in the s but is now a global phenomenon started as a reaction to this type of monopolistic environment.   ,beer,d0yhk7h,46,t5_2qhg1

6919116,0,t3_4aihkm,Two basic things Old beer wont make you sick especially if its around Cold beers will definitely stay better for a much longer time period than warm.From hereBasically most beers on the market are best within a few months of bottling. If kept refrigerated this lifespan can be extended a few months maybe up to a year. Ive noticed that after too long beers start to get flat and lose all hop character and might also start tasting like aluminum. Youll know if you have one thats this old. To my experience the better the beer the shorter the lifespan some exceptions below.If youve got hop forward beers such as any IPA or IIPA really those are best drank ASAP. Especially dry hopped beers or late kettle addition beers since they lose their aroma over time. Always keep them cold and drink them at most within a few months. But again these wont kill you so might as well drink them.Finally beers that age well such as imperial stouts and some sours are even better the older they get. These can be stored in a room temperature light free cabinet for years. The higher the ABV the better theyll age generally. Keeping them in a fridge will slow down this aging process.So in summary most beers are best when fresh but wont kill you so might as well try it! Also what sort of beers do you have? This info might help us help you better.,beer,d10lson,8,t5_2qhg1

Drink it soon.  Yes?  Move to step .. Put it in a cool dark place that it wont be disturbed a lot.What doesnt age well  In general the following doesnt age well Hops coffee chocolate.

7231817,0,t1_d204i87,Yeah thats the trick  nobody can confirm anything they say and only have their own palates to go by. And palates are influenced both by timedevelopment and by psychology. So its a jumble of indistinct and moving targets that are hard to pin down all together. But thats always the big fear when someone gets bought. Are they going to Becks it? Everybody fears theyll centralize operations standardize and cheap out on ingredients or take other shortcuts and ruin what was special and great about the beer in the name of efficiency profit whatever of the larger machine. And like we agree above you cant know for sure what they change or dont change even as your palate shifts. But meanwhile people who work for the bigs including in this sub say wait we bought a successful product because people like it and you think we want to go in and make it worse? How does that make sense? Theres some logic in that yet realistically it seems like the big guys dont sell beer  they sell brand experiences same as any big product company. They know they can get people to buy the product based on label branding advertising promotions placement availability etc. whether or not the product is great. So I imagine they figure costsaving changes to the actual beer wont be noticed behind all of that stuff and that it wont matter a whole lot anyway as distribution ramps up to compensate. Ive been trying to pay attention to different peoples reactions to various postbuyout beers here over the last handful of years since the question remains kind of hazy and open. There are business tacticalethical concerns with buyouts that make plenty of people dislike them irrespective of the beer itself and whether or not it changes but Im still wondering about the big question of how much  how often does the beer actually change for the reasons we always fear it will.,beer,d207dcu,1,t5_2qhg1

7602818,0,t3_4jfkns,All beers are made with yeast but not all beers have yeast left in them at packaging. Many larger breweries filter their beers before packaging. Maltose in most cases if we are talking about the chemical will be completely consumed by brewing yeast. Maltiness residual malt flavor from unfermentable sugars is what you are taking about.Many times but not always beers with strong yeast character or maltiness have higher abv than your prototypical light beer. More alcohol causes more pain and if youre drinking  beers regardless the higher abv could be to blame.,beer,d36egc6,1,t5_2qhg1

Once we were there alone he became another person. No longer a PR figure just a bloke at a pub. We had several rounds he even let me pour a beer from one of the barrels and chatted for over an hour using the familiar ty instead of the formal vy. I was impressed Berka is a man who really really loves beer in general not just the brand he sells.

7732727,0,t1_d3l3bx9,No you are being willfully obtuse. The issue here is that diet foods are marketed towards women. Every single product you mentioned is heavily marketed towards women because it is thought to have less calories regardless if it actually does or not. Because women are socialized via media and advertising that it is imperative that we are thin women are more inclined to buy guiltfree products as we are conditioned to feel shame when we enjoy something that might make us less attractive or put on the pounds. This is very different from the marketing of health foods which are geared to target both men and women. It is not the desire to be healthy that advertisers are trying to reach when they market these diet foods but rather the desire of female socialization to be skinny. Of course you are right that gendered marketing is everywhere but when it comes to food its really just one type of food products that are almost exclusively geared towards women and that spans from Diet Coke to ground turkey.

Meanwhile try cider. Its similar in strength to beer its easy to drink and it looks like beer in the glass so you can feel like you fit in with your bros. You say other alcohol is nasty but cocktails can be made to where you barely taste the alcohol so youve got plenty of options.

8537802,0,t1_d64ue2a,Bavarians are particularly snobby about their beer. Everyone in the dorfs there thinks that their local brewery makes the best beer but its almost invariably mediocre to decent. Ive had a Bavarian tell me that the best beer was a dunkel from the neighboring village that Id rate a  and thats in comparison to other dunkels. Its really redneck down there a sentiment which is frequently espoused by Germans in every other state. The Texas of Germany. The attitude is just the same as people in Bumfuck Texas who would recoil if you handed them a tantalizing IPA but insist that Budweiser or Pabst is the shit. Weihenstephaner is fairly affordable for a wei in comparison to the huge brands like Paulaner Franziskaner but its not cheap either and it has a delicate appreciable flavor. When I think farmers beer I think of a cheap simple beer. Chances are Weihenstephaner was out of his comfort zone and he was buying cases for  euros directly fro that brewery and since its his brand its the best. That sounds more like farmers beer to me.,beer,d68sixc,2,t5_2qhg1

Thus if a coffee blend is sold under the name BLASTER in California only the trademark rights to that name exist only in California. If another coffee retailer begins to market a different blend in New York under the same name assuming they had no knowledge of the California company then there would be no trademark infringement.

8771455,0,t3_508808,A couple perspectives . Craft breweries are constantly changing things. Theyre growing installing new equipment experimenting with ingredients and techniques learning and applying what they learn to make the best beer they can. Many craft brewers would love to have the resources to be as efficient and consistent as the macros. Which leads me to . breweries that sell to macros or other large breweries or PE often do so in order to gain access to those resources. They want nationwide distribution they want improved QA resources they want to brew  barrels at a time and need to keep brewing more because its selling that much. So theyd probably scale their recipes up to that size eventually via their own means. But doing so with a macro that already has the equipment QA processes and experience with them is much less risky. So . scaling up a recipe by a factor of  or more as may be the case when a craft recipe moves to a macro production facility is simply not a linear thing. It takes experiments and trials and the recipe will be different even if the goal is to make the beer in your pint glass taste the same.In all of which I dont really answer your question. And cant give a factual yesno because Im not a brewer that a macro bought and told just keep making it the way you do or we shipped you some corn put it in your beer. But I am a craft brewer and can definitely say were always making little adjustments and tweaks to the recipes always working to make the best beer. I also have friends at a macro acquired craft brewery and their stories are all the same as mine just working to make the best beer. Theyve mentioned nothing about having to change recipes though Ive heard some about the challenges of getting a craft recipe right on a macro brewhouse just that their pay and benefits got better and their safety regulations are more by the book.,beer,d723irk,3,t5_2qhg1

9002933,0,t1_d7u02uc,No objections from me at all. I appreciate the feedback.I apologise I dont think I was clear. The diminishing drink idea doesnt relate to the amount of drink offered. It refers to the price. So say the initial purchase of the cocktail is . The next refill would be a percentage lower but for splicitys sake lets say . The next lower and so forth. This means that they are incentivised to stay with the same book and the same pairing without having to pay the inflated cocktail price every time.The digital market would probably have an impact yes. However I think that could also be integrated. Audible prices are reasonable and audiobook format could be offered as well.

It all depends on your ambition and willingness to work hard.  You can go far without any education but unless you are one of the first employees of a successful brewery you likely will have someone with an education as your boss before long. I would say  of breweries have no use for a microbiologist.  That degree is overkill unless you want a job at a yeast company or a major LARGE brewery M BBLyearTrade schools are quite valuable and cost effective.

9803668,0,t1_dalglxy,In general you probably shouldnt be aging beer at all.  Its almost always better the closer to bottlingkegging.  And I say this as someone with hundreds of bottles in offsite storage so Im far from anticellaring.That said there are adjuncts that I prefer with a little bit of age on them  specifically coffee as Im not much of a coffee drinker to start with and prefer a somewhat muted flavor.  And there are fruited beers that I think do a lot better with a couple of years on them  most cantillon lambics fall into this category imo.But regardless a vertical is rarely about trying the beer at its best and more seeing how it changes over time.  Tough to do as recipes and ingredients change but you do your best.  Ive had a IIPA vertical before early on in my craft beer days and it was an excellent educational experience they dont turn into amazing barleywines after all! though not a great beer drinking experience.  Likewise its interesting to see what happens to flavors like coffee vanilla coconuts cocoa nibs etc as time affects the beer.Personally Im largely over verticals at this point though I wont turn down the invite when my buddy opens every Fou Foune ever.  The beers are largely not at their prime drinking time and it usually ends up being a fairly overwhelming amount of the sameish beer in one setting.  A normal bottle share is more fun for me at this point usually.,beer,dalihc2,3,t5_2qhg1

A big reason why so many glasses are narrower at the top than the bottom is to help keep the aroma in the glass crucial to many styles especially IPAs. Etching on the bottom of a glass can help maintain carbonation longer as well which is good for the mouthfeel in many beers.

More Brettcentric beers tend to age slowly and gracefully while more lactic beers will develop additional acids quicker especially in the presence of fruit. We have a kriek that came in around . pH on draught and the portion we bottled dropped down to . during the conditioning period.

Im still finding new things that I like and some that I dislike but Im damn sure enjoying the discovery and experience. I would definitely suggest to hit some local breweries and try some things. Find a beer that seems interesting and ask the person behind the counter what it tastes like. Some of the places I go they ask me what I normally drink and that helps them make a suggestion. If you genuinely enjoy beer then just try things. The worst thing that happens is you spend a few bucks on a pint you dont like and you get some water.

With the slowdown in growth starting to show its face in real ways in  with some notable layoffs you just wonder if some of these big expansions are happening at exactly the wrong time.

10872433,0,t1_de1ek8o,I am guessing there would be an estimate on the kit. That is kind of the only guess I could make. As I said in the question below temperature control is important. Not just for flavour but also to help the yeast consume all the sugars they can. When fermentation nears its end the Krausen foam has fallen increasing the temperature a little bit can help the yeast who now become sluggish to finish up. Also ensure that you are pitching a proper amount of yeast. When using dried yeast that means you best rehydrate it before adding. To do that you sprinkle the yeast into warm water C and let it sit covered for min or so. Helps the cell walls build up again and about doubles the amount of healthy cells you put in compared to just sprinkling it into the wort. ,beer,de1ewzn,2,t5_2qhg1

Im not sure how many Israeli beers make it stateside so that was cool.  Then the beer itself was incredibly unique so much so that I thought it was worth giving the brewery some love and sharing with the sub here.  Then in researching the brewery I found it was located on a kibbutz thats when a colleague of mine mentioned he lived on a kibbutz a few actually over  years. Anyways I have rbeer in mind when doing reviews in that I try to produce something more than just a description of a beer.  I try to pack in little TILs that make it worth a read.

11542236,0,t3_64qup4,Gose are ales gaining popularity recently as a poor mans sour. These beers are typically lower in alcohol . These ales has may have a slight saltiness as a result of salt being added to the brewing process. If you are just starting out with sour beers these are a good place to start as the flavors arent typically extremely tartsour. A berliner weisse is going to be goses cousin or der Vetter. Its flavor mimics the tartness of a gose but without the residual saltiness. A sour beer gets its sourness from the wild yeast used to brew it. Before the modern sanitation era barrels of beer would literally be left open to catch wild yeast floating through the air. Now breweries use a more sanitary approach and just add wild yeast. These sour beers take much longer to ferment and develop. The sour needs to mellow to be an actual drinkable brew. Due to this longer aging process these beers typically cost more per ounce than the average ale. If just getting into sours Id recommend starting with a gose. They are getting pretty popular and can usually be found in the distributor or Weis Yay Pennsylvania finally getting out of the dark ages! Sours on the otherhand can be harder to obtain and like stated earlier would be more expensive. I was in NC last week and picked up  Wicked Weed sours for about  a bottle.

11703669,0,t1_dgmmltn,No thats not how fighting monopolies works this is how crony capitalism works. Nothing in this has anything to do with fighting monopolies at all you have no clue what youre talking about,beer,dgmmom9,-1,t5_2qhg1
11708798,0,t3_672map,Wish they had provided more ranking than the top six and notes on more than just the top .  Interesting to see Nickel Brook won it.  I usually end up in Canada once or twice a year and their beers are the best Ive found so far though Ive been hearing a lot of hype around Bellwoods lately.  But I was never really blown away by any of their stuff just thought it was pretty good.  Didnt know they were distributing stateside though Ill have to keep an eye out.,beer,dgn8075,7,t5_2qhg1

11779597,0,t1_dgv8qia,I dont work for AB believe it or not. I know a lot of people who brew and work there so maybe I have I different perspective on their brewing process? As for the other thread I was defending good neutral beer writing vs. pointedly antiAB pieces. If theres a good beer story on October should it be discounted because AB invests in that outlet? If you check my post history Ive been pretty consistent in my comments. The people who work there are very passionate about beer. Their business practices are pretty shady.,beer,dgv96o4,11,t5_2qhg1
