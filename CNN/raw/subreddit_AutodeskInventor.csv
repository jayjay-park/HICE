6423026,0,t1_czjie68,Honestly not sure about that.. I would check to see if the desktop has most or all of the requirements fulfilled that windows  needs to run such as windows  bit and all that and try it anyways. Even if you copy it to the desktop and it doesnt run you should be able to delete it off the computer.,AutodeskInventor,czjoeaj,2,t5_2xb9v

7391180,0,t3_4gjilu,Use Vault for file management. Vault Basic comes free with Inventor.We use one project file Designs.ipj for all of our projects and use folders Named with the project numbers to differentiate each project.Vault makes saving backing up and managing privileges a breeze. Plus it has a really good tool for copying designs.Beyond that your templates will likely be Content Center components. You will also want to manage this through Vault as well.The more time and though you take setting up your Vault and libraries in the beginning will save you a lot of time down the road. I might even suggest checking with your reseller if they offer these kinds of services.,AutodeskInventor,d2ibs6h,3,t5_2xb9v
