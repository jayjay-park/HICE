7178772,0,t3_4dtgf7,basically shes super consistent by design so she needs to have low numbers to be balancedproblem is that shes mainly a support champ and in current meta support needs utility that doesnt rely on statsitemslevels which is what sona isnt. champ blows when behind they have to lower her consistency if they want her to have utility that is less reliant on levelsitems,sonamains,d1u5tv8,2,t5_37tnr

7867672,0,t1_d40br3w,Someone called? PWith Tear I try to get it as soon as possible usually around same time as Sheen and right beforeafter Sightstone.  Sona is so spammy with her skills that it will stack up fairly quickly.  It is situational but DAMN does it help with Sonas mana problems if you like to use your abilities to keep up power chord as much as possible.Seraphs also combos well with either Lich Bane or Iceborn Gauntlet due to the mana they give you.  Combine that with a Morellonomicon or Rod of Ages and you got a hefty amount of mana to turn into AP with Seraphs.,sonamains,d40edsn,1,t5_37tnr
7926767,0,t3_4npdre,Your build is mostly fine. Few points from me.Build Locket or Banner every game as rd item if you arent vs full AD. Aegis is the biggest fuck you of an item a support can get. Consider Mikaels instead of Athenes vs CC heavy teams. Generally Athenes is way better and I dont like this item very much but it has some uses and can make for miraculous saves. I strongly recommend swapping Rylai for Iceborn. Yeah its a great item but I believe you should be generally more defensive. You cant blow up people instantly most of the time and by midlate game you will need more survivability. Randuin is also good in that resort.EDITOh and also do take every kill you can as long as it doesnt tilt your teammates hard. Sona with a few early kills snowballs harder than most ADCs. Also you have to rely mostly on yourself in such a low elo. Kills on your teammates will be useless if they are just dumb and dont use them in efficient way. Be smarter than every other person in the match. On AP bulliesbursters like Sona Annie Brand VelKoz Zyra gold is never wasted.,sonamains,d471kq0,1,t5_37tnr
7996488,0,t1_d4eroyd,I mean yea Sona can miss ult but Annie can miss W. Sona cant. Sona for a mage has some of the the smallest amounts of variance in the game and Riot has hit a deadend on what to do with her because of that.,sonamains,d4evqm7,0,t5_37tnr
8239627,0,t3_4rrwwm,gtNow reduces Sonas basic abilities QWE cooldown by  this interacts will cooldown reduction of items runes and masteries.No longer empowers Sonas basic abilities.Is this a passive CDR or Activated amp Temporary triggered on Ult activation?  Does it exceed the CDR cap of  depending on masteries?Right now I tend to get the full CDR early amp Morellonomicon is sort of enough.  Depending on Assists.,sonamains,d57icvs,1,t5_37tnr

8457879,0,t3_4vbqdx,Some matchups like Zyra Id just avoid playing Sona. Its just too painful. In other instances Id imagine youd avoid Soraka. Theres a divide in that at least.,sonamains,d5yrpqv,3,t5_37tnr
9009086,0,t3_53nrfk,I dont get it.  I included a break down of the fundamentals of the game amp just how the opposing team did a lot right  but they still lost because Sona Spammy W Optimised Sona is pretty nuts.  Their support wasted all that gold on the Locket amp never used the active because they were waiting for the big ass Wombo Combo that never happened.  Meanwhile our fed buffed amp healed Assassins picked them apart.  We had NO TANKS amp beat a theoretically more balanced team with x tanks ADC APC amp Janna.I abandoned our ADC because they were abusive amp ignorant.  They raged at me for not ulting at L so I roamed amp helped the other  teamates.It shows a bunch of things that worked in Low ELO despite the conventional wisdom.  And the conventional wisdom correctly applied wasnt enough to beat Spammy Sona.  Its Sona Gameplay Porn although low end  it has several nice fights where none of us died got kills amp were all on slivers of health.,sonamains,d7ur1yd,1,t5_37tnr

10515788,0,t1_dd01hil,Thats actually a really nice way of describing it. Its consistent but I think a consistent build isnt using Sona to her absolute best. For me Ive played the champion for  years and at this point Im pretty confident that I know the ins and outs of her really well. So for me the AP build is consistent. I think the thing that bugs me is that playes like you say things like its unrealistic I feel like youre gibbing yourself and your potential. Once you get used to minmaxing gold with Spellthiefs and making sure you tag people for assist gold stacking Mejais and keeping up with gold isnt unrealistic at all. But I just think what I struggle grasping is that Sona has many playstyles and not everyone wants to put themselves in a feast or famine situation every game. I just cant get behind playing Redemption  Locket Heal Bot Sona.,sonamains,dd02snr,1,t5_37tnr

11152741,0,t3_5z6wyv,It is really more about maximizing your purchases and back timing than your build.  Every game will be slightly different but you need to capitalize on your opportunities to get an advantage on your opponent.Your level  should be spent harassing your enemy to scare them away from cs and maybe get them to back before hey can buy anything.  If they back with enough gold to buy something  you should shove the lane and back as well.  If you get greedy and stay they will now have the advantage when they return.,sonamains,dew5gj7,1,t5_37tnr
11173037,0,t1_dexxk44,I find it weird personally how people say that flat runes are better than scaling runes  however sona is a more late game champions lvl  is where sona spikes and about  where scaling runes become better than flat runes.You also forget the fact that if you were to get Armour runes  along with Ice born youre going to have too much armor and not enough Health making  much weaker  Armor  to  ad damage You need to balance both your  MR and Armor along with health!  The reason why This build dosnt have Magic pen runes is that youre not meant to  do much dama the more  ap is to increase your W strengths along  with  the other abilites and passive.With the masteries You can go with eitther I see very little difference which my masteries and your thoughts C ,sonamains,deyg9fw,1,t5_37tnr
