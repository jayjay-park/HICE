516286,0,t1_cfys5tw,Considering all fighting this system does is make things worse I dont think thats the best course of action.Student evaluations come up during departmental evaluations of a professor. They can determine how many classes that professor will teach in the future or whether a new class theyve taught will remain as a class. They can determine whether a guest lecturer will become an assistant professor or if their contract will get renewed.They also give a professor feedback as to whether they can make changes to better a class. While it wont directly affect the students taking the class at the time it may be a benefit to future students in the classes they teach. And if theres a huge outcry for changes the professor doesnt make them and continues to get those complaints? You can bet that will come up the next time that professor has a job evaluation.Professors and departments rarely talk about why the evals are important because they assume none of that matters to us. But it might. I have a professor thats a guest lecturer right now. Theyre trying to get a permanent position. The department confirmed that evals will come into play during the hiring process because why would they want to hire a professor that the students dont like? Last quarter I had a professor teach a brand new class and I helped TA for one. Evals could make or break whether those classes get taught again.Not filling out your evals to fight the system only hurts an already suffering education system. Not giving feedback means crappy professors continue to avoid getting reprimanded new classes wont be kept because there wasnt enough interest new professors may not get offered another contract professors wont know if they should improve how they lecture. While it might not apply to someone who will never take a class with that professor again not filling them out continues to promote the broken education system thats in place and causes further problems for future students.Moving evals to online saves professors the pain of having to cut a lecture short so the class can fill out evals. But it also GREATLY reduces how many people actually fill them out. Which is why they barrage us with reminders. Sure some people will set up spam filters and never deal with evals again. But others may get the third email and think ...maybe I should fill out my evals.I help supervise for a class Im a TA but Im not a TA its complicated. Its a new class. Last quarter we got  evaluations back. Do you think thats enough interest to keep a class going? Two evaluations? Chances are it wont exist next year. But it gives students in our department job experience thats incredibly useful in our field. And those who took the class enjoyed it. But without evals to prove that the interest paid off and that it was good how does the department know whether they should bother to keep it on the schedule? They dont. Which means a class that gave students practical job experience might get scrapped. Does it hurt me? No Im graduating this year. But itll suck for students next year that might have wanted to get that experience and now wont.Sorry for the am wall of text but man evals actually are important. Its just that no one ever tells us why they are. We just hear Fill out your evals! Theyre important! without ever getting an explanation as to why beyond Theyll help us improve the class! Evals do so much more.TLDR If anything filling out evals is fighting the system. They give us a voice that we may not otherwise have. And that voice usually gets heard.,UCSC,cfyyeea,7,t5_2r3oq

648299,0,t3_21kjuy,Id love to add onto colleges  and ...I was at  and really there wasnt much difference between us and  except for our core courses and other collegespecific meetings. We didnt talk to the people over at  much so it was like we were separate but still the same.A lot of people seemed to say that  was full of Asians. This might be true but I dont know what the exact demographics are in  or any of the other colleges. I guess I ended up becoming friends with a fair amount of different AsianAsian American students. We also had some of the fraternities and sororities that were mostly comprised of Asian members come to try and recruit at .I really enjoyed how close we were to upper campus. There are great trails out there and we would sometimes take cool night hikes to find the Buddha hut the cat shrine the wishing tree etc. We had a small group of people set up a forest rave once. Then they kept doing it every other week or so until it got too big and the cops busted them. I heard about forest parties now and then but I dont know how common they are now. In any case its great in the day time for hikes and people seem to enjoy it for smoking weed in the evening since Porter Meadow seems so far from .Terra Fresca is in my opinion not that good. They always change their menu so maybe you will get something good once in a while. In my opinion its just meh. But I really like the University Center for its cute little study lounge with the fireplace and balcony and theres Perks up there too. We had a small cafe attached to the college  dorms. They hold open mics or poetry nights there. Theres also a pool table which people like. Its not really a cafe...it serves regular coffee only and sells Costco snacks but it was good enough. Its a neat place to hang out. Theres also a pool table in the apartments community room so were all set to play pool anytime.We were also close to the ILC so I met some cool exchange students and we had a good time. And if you want to live there in your continuing years they have really good apartments.I actually really like Oakes except that its far away. Oakes and Cowell have the best views on campus. And Oakes gets a lot of sun which is nice. Theres also Oakes cafe which has some of the best food on campus. Great BLTs and burgers. I spent all my flexis there. And when I didnt have flexis I just spent the rest of my money. The Oakes dining hall kinda sucks but then again all of the dining halls kinda suck.Anyway enough about that. I loved C. The only downside is that we dont have a cool name or a good identity yet. ,UCSC,cgdymx5,7,t5_2r3oq
648712,0,t3_21kjuy,People considering colleges might also want to look at the guide linked on the sidebar but some of the info is outdated.As a Stevenson affiliate heres what I have to add or to respond to OP about with topics bolded.As for the CowellStevenson dining hall I think its fine though occasionally the food isnt that great and I flee to  and . I like all the food being more or less all on one side of the dining all in contrast to other dining halls where I feel like different food stations are spread out all over the place. The dining hall also has a patio where you can have a nice ocean view.One petty thing Ill slightly miffed about is that on Cowell College Nights they take over the Dining Hall and Stevenson students have to go somewhere else but on Stevenson College Nights we get the Event Center and Cowell students still get to go to the Dining Hall. As I said its petty.gt In my opinion the architecture in Stevenson had a lot of character and I liked going there more than Cowell.I dont love Stevensons architecture but it doesnt get on my nerves either. Stevensons architecture is basically white walls and black trim if anyones interested.gtCowell College is also close to Pogonip which has great hiking trails. Cowell also has a neat little library that sits next to the dining hall and an art gallery. Stevenson is even closer to Pogonip than Cowell is and Stevenson has its own college library which depending on your viewpoint can be described as cozy or run down.Its worth mentioning that Stevenson is the only Core Course thats two quarters long instead of one. It used to be even longer three quarters. It fulfills the TA Gen Ed requirement though I think some other Core Courses fulfill it too so I dont know if Stevenson students get out ahead in terms of requirements in exchange for being in Core an extra quarter. The courses theme is Self and Society and you can sum up the books you read as in Fall Quarter you read texts that provided a philosophical base for societies and in Winter Quarter the texts you read challenge the base set up the previous quarter. Some people dont like the reading and think its just a burden to be skimmed through but others like the ideas that the texts bring up and get discussed in class. Its cheesy but you get out what you put in.Stevenson dorms have lounges that make it easy to meet people I dont know if other colleges dorms or Kresges apartments have something similar.gtMerrill is between College  and StevensonCowell so it has somewhat of a central location. Ive always considered Merrill somewhat out of the way especially the apartments because you have to go up that hill. Its not Oakes far away but I still hesitate to call it somewhat central.,UCSC,cge0bq5,1,t5_2r3oq

863456,0,t1_ch2ak7p,Yes you do. Its a bit of a work biking uphill to Merrill but you can definitely do it if you want Both Crown and Merrill have their own individual classrooms but there are no large lecture halls around there like you would find near Cowell Humanities Lecture Hall or in Science Hill Earth and Marines B. The smaller classrooms there are usually for section English core classes or for some smaller upperdivision classes. Theres more drug use in Merrill than most people believe. Its definitely not as sterile as people say but as with the entire university if youre not into it no one will pressure you. If you are Im sure youll find people who are in the same boat as you Triples arent TOO cramped but depending on how much stuff you and your roommate have it may get a bit stuffy. It varies among individuals and the amount of stuff they bring with them and how tidy they are. I find that if you keep tidy the space seems a whole lot bigger than it lets off Its really easy to make friends at Merrill. Ive made a ton of friends my freshmen year from my core class many of whom I still talk to and my main group of friends were from my freshmen year. Its up the hill so its a bit isolated however due to this fact everyone at Merrill knows and are friendsacquaintances with each other.The apartments are pretty awesome. Its a bit further back but its really spacious. The living rooms are pretty big the kitchens decent for a college apartment anyway. Absolutely no complains except if you have an apartment near the trash bin area be careful about ants during the rainy season. In terms of affiliates and majors not really. My year we had people from ALL sorts of major in my hall and just across the board.Merrill residential area is made up of  main dorm for the freshmen A dorm and B dorm. Theres also C and D dorm for the continuing students but freshmen rarely live in the C and D dorm. Theres the colelge office and behind the college office is classrooms and a study area called MAS. We also have another study lounge called Casa Latina as well as a hangout loungestudy lounge called Baobab lounge. Theres also a writing room where its just a few tables and chairs and lots of blackboard so people go there to study for midterms or do brainstorm for projectswriting. The apartments are the further back more towards upper campus. Were pretty far back so were as close to upper campus and the forest as youre going to get another one thats far back is College . Lots and lots of trees and sometimes you can hear coyotes andor mountain lions in the middle of the night. Lots of wildlife too bunnies turkey etc. Biggest problem? Honestly nothing really...theres nothing that absolutely stands out that I hate so much that Id tell the whole wide world. I love Merrill and Im really glad I got placed there despite the fact that I had picked College  and College  as my first  choices and Merrill being rd.

The degree does not matter and the only people who will tell you that are the people who cant program or dont understand how the game works.I see in another comment you wanted to know how many people go on to work in games and I will tell you that there are very few who do. Not because of their respective degrees mind you some of my peers with a CSGD degree are currently working at Microsoft Google etc. They are exceptionally brilliantHere is the reason the most skilled developers in the world are games programmers. I am thoroughly convinced that between ID and Valve they employee the best of almost every CS discipline in the world and pay them well. These guys have been working in the industry for  years and are remarkably skilled in what they do as well as having incredible breath havent you read the valve employee handbook?. Getting to that point was NOT easy and code monkeys in big studios get paid below average it IS a labor of love after all and you will not get these skills by simply taking courses here at stanford MiT or anywhere. This is where it gets exciting.Computer Science is a field that is changing the most and it effects everyone. Between StackOverflow Kahn Academy and CodeAcademy it has made going to college a huge waste of time I have never been asked for my GPA or my courses during an interview. The only thing that matters is your projects stuff you have created to help people to advance the field or to prove that something is possible CryptoCurrency is a tech beauty. You want to work in Valve? Build something they need Gaben will jump for joy!So to reiterate it all matters on the individual. I know some straight CS majors I could and do code circles around so as long as you have a C.S. in the title dont sweat it. That being said the biggest advantage you have as a game design major is a year long game project. You shine there and companies will literally wine and dine you assuming you dont go indie and the CS major will be left with only his pseudocompiler still impressive just not as much.As a csgd the DANM courses are pretty useless as well as the ethics course but  and the s are awesome. In the end you have to build yourself into a wizard dont let ANYONE tell you different. But I believe in you kid you inquired before applying you asked questions.

It takes me about  minutes to get to school another  to find parking and what not. It does cost some extra gas money but I save much more on rent than I would ever spend on gas. Not only that but the area is fucking amazing being up in the redwoods away from all the crime and grime of downtown Santa Cruz. Getting groceries is a bit of a pain but I just try to stop by the safeway on the westside after class once or twice a week and if I need to I can always run down to Felton to pick up milk or eggs.

If the workload for four or five is too high then your entire quarter may go to shit. Id recommend just taking three classes this quarter and seeing how that pans out. Too easy? Feel free to add another class. It could also turn out that three is the sweet spot for you. Theres a reason most people take three classes. ,UCSC,cst6fnq,1,t5_2r3oq

5727761,0,t1_cx6zoep,I was just going to leave a snarky f that sh. But I think you know the answer that while a safe space is a nice thing to have it is impossible to create  safety for  of the people while respecting  of everyones rights. And as someone who leans more to the individual rights  antiauthoritarian spectrum I dont think the school has a very strong obligation to ensure safe spaces for all. First goal of school is education. Safe spaces come from that goal because education is enhanced by asking questions exchanging ideas with others and having a safe space makes it easier to ask questions and exchange ideas. However the current paradox of safe spaces infringing on freedom of speech is happening because people have latched onto the safe space idea as the goal when it aint. Education is the goal and a safe space is only useful up to the point when it stops enhancing education and starts eroding it.But really fuck that shit.,UCSC,cx7324p,5,t5_2r3oq

As for are you better off going to another school I cant really tell you. I think the program here is pretty good. The party life being non existent has so far not been the case for me. I can maybe see that as a freshman in the dorms it will be a bit tougher but I imagine once part of your social group moves to some houses in the city second year youll find plenty of parties. Generally Im going to a house party or a house show every weekend plus Im  so I tend to hit the bars its a dead weekend. So dont sweat that too much. As for athletics yeah there isnt too much.Jobsinternships there are plenty. The school can help you line up internship openings via job faires but also we are less than an hour from silicon valley so Ive just been sending my resume and application to every company I can find and Im getting a few responses here and there. My professors and TA helped me put my resume together so resources are there if you ask for them.DifficultyWorkload racks up pretty fast. CS is not an easy major and there are a few notoriously difficult classes in the program here. First  years youll be doing general ed and lower divs so it wont be that bad but later on theres classes like Operating Systems me and  partners regularly put in  hours per week each on just projects. Or Algorithm Design where a homework assignment can take well over  hours not counting going to section and studying and you have one due every week.

Id recommend checking out who is teaching genetics in winter and spring and taking who has the best reviews. edit so i see strome and bhalla are teaching in winter kamakaka in spring. i have heard that strome is probably the best genetics professor at UCSC. unfortunately her classes fill up fast and they are active learning classes so the class cap is much smaller like less than . I have not heard great things about bhalla from friends that have taken her but to be fair my friends werent the greatest students. i knew someone that got a C in my genetics class and retook the class with kamakaka. she said that he was waaaaay better than our professor Ruben and really liked his teaching style. whatever you decide to do i wish you the best of luck. and try not to be discouraged about this. genetics is known at every university as being one of the hardest bio major classes. i know someone in med school that took it x because she got a D the first go around. med school forums are filled with posts that regard genetics as one of those nightmare classes. enjoy your break and do your best not to stress over this class for too long at least....,UCSC,db55xh6,3,t5_2r3oq

11199277,0,t3_5zvdad,. They could be expanded its not too uncommon for  seats to be added to these classes. . CMPE  is a great class. I took it last spring and tutored for it this quarter. You learn about logic gates and how to create networks of them from truth tables and also memory mostly via D flip flops. In the labs you program FPGAs to create your design. Heres a link to the most complicated lab from this quarter with a video of the finished product. Be warned that the labs are a lot of work though.. Not sure about this.. shrug Try to get in early taking GEs over the summer or taking more classes per quarter will increase your creditspriority if you dont get into a class but waitlists havent opened it yet you can constantly check to see if someones dropped it.,UCSC,df1fah4,1,t5_2r3oq

11238067,0,t1_df5t3tp,  Doesnt matter. Each college has students from every major and its great like that.   I dont smoke. There are people who smoke they are people who dont. The majority of the campus are not stoners. Again not everyone here is here to smoke weed.  Im a proposed CS major and it is not so bad trying to get classes in under division. Higher division courses are a mess to get into but not near impossible especially if youre a senior needing one class to graduate. You will get priority depending on your situation  Pretty sure that still isnt allowed in the dorms. I really do not see anyone vaping out in public oncampus.   Depends. CSOs arent though.  Lower division courses are typically taught in Java.   Um... dont know You need to learn how and when to do work. Its college and mistakes are PRICEY.   You will be placed into the  series calculus for STEM field. Theres nothing wrong with taking the st  course A. Theres plenty of help from TAs office hours professors office hours ACE MSILSS to provide help you need to pass your courses.   I would say start with Math an intro CS class and your college core class writing class  sigh  Go talk to people. Theres plenty of social events at the start of the year. Good luck with roommates you gotta be chill too bruh Im not an upperclassmen whoops. ,UCSC,df5thnk,5,t5_2r3oq
11265331,0,t3_60s19c,Yeah.. the classes filled up really fast mainly for upper div tho. Lower div on the other hand arent too bad since its usually a large class size anyways. To be honest man stack up on any credits you can before hitting your upper div because any class after cs  is really tough to get into even for a junior standing student to get into. I was able to get senior standing by my junior year so it made a significantly easier to get classes. ,UCSC,df8wqbr,1,t5_2r3oq

11361414,0,t3_624d3g,Chances are pretty slim youll be able to get in as a UCSC transfer. College acceptances are holistic and not fully based on stats but I also did apply to UCSD as a transfer and I had.CEEE double majorcompleted tutoring jobs quarter of research experienceand I didnt get in. Maybe my personal statements sucked?But to answer your direct question you should just take whichever classes apply to your major. Dont take other things and mess up your UCSC CS degree in hopes of transferring to UCSD by using GPA boosters. I would stick with the schedule you outlined in your post.,UCSC,dfjsmvt,4,t5_2r3oq
