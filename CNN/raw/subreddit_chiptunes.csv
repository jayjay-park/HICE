2365148,0,t1_cm417mn,I find it not to be cashing in really. When I want to make money from software development for example I dont bank on making all my money from selling copies since I only develop free software.Instead I market and sell my skill as a developer to others and make software for them at a cost. This way I get all the profit I was hoping for and the customer gets their freedom.I havent even composed music for a living but I imagine you could do something similar. Sell your skills as a composerarranger and make new music at cost then give your sponsors their freedom as well as everyone else.If someone uses your tracks in a project you dont approve of most of these free culture licenses if not all do not allow the licensee to associate you with the project only give you credit for having made the music. Lets say for whatever crazy reason Im making a detonator for a nuclear warhead and putting your music into the program mind the absurdity here Im assuming you dont approve of nuclear war. I would be required to say that I used your music but I would not be allowed to say that you support or endorse what Im doing with it thus protecting your image. If I go around thanking you for supporting something you dont support its slanderlibel and I could face criminal charges and rightly so.I would say to you do your homework on what free culture stands for and see if youd like to get behind it as Ive gotten behind free software as a developer. If you do decide to then look at the Free Art License and CCBYSA I love copyleft and consider using them to sellgive away to the general public and offer a different license to corporations who are unwilling to share and sell it to them for a few thousand dollars.Its a controversial way to make money in the free software world duallicensing as I described above but I find it less of an issue in culture as long as the public doesnt have to pay extra for freedom but rather the corporations who dont care about freedom.,chiptunes,cm41i7n,2,t5_2qlmr
