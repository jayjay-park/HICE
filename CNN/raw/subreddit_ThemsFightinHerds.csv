5145611,0,t3_3lgtc5,I feel like as Im the person who originally spread it in the twitch chat I should weigh in on this.As a little nod to the amount of time that has been sunk into this and the original game it would be fine but at the same time it was just a silly typo that everyone ran with.Think of it this way. New game new characters and the possibility of new memes. Swaf had its time to shine and we can have something newer and better for the new game. The community will build its own roots and come into its own.,ThemsFightinHerds,cv68m8i,2,t5_39qs3
5241641,0,t1_cvhj2um,Just an FYI. Max knows about the game but it doesnt look like hes interested in helping this game out. Finding out that it uses the Skullgirls Engine made him even less interested in the game.,ThemsFightinHerds,cvht30c,1,t5_39qs3
5377661,0,t1_cvz1zvt,well with the way Omari is pulling it off it looks relatively easy and hes doing it on  characters at the same timeit also seems like you should be continuously teabagging to keep the loop,ThemsFightinHerds,cvz2246,2,t5_39qs3
5428200,0,t1_cw4w8v7,A bit of both really.Theres stuff that just cant be predicted like mid to late spikes in popularity. Maybe a bit of media coverage maybe something that was causing hesitance got cleared up or maybe even just time of the year.ZANO Drone is a good example of that. To account a little for stuff like that the prediction is overall a little optimistic but really not much can be done other than react when it happens and try to recognise a one off good day from a sustained boost.Most larger scale campaigns  Say upwards of  or  backers  follow a very similar pattern of starting very strong doing very little in the middle then ending strongly.Exactly how that strong end plays out depends on a number of things a push to get a potentially failing campaign over  is different from the people who buy into an already funded campaign  presumably to get in before the door closes. Although it could easily also be mistrust of the platform and howwhen they actually might charge you money.Notable examples Exploding Kittens  Sondors Electric Bike  ConMan  Divinity Original Sin This campaign is I think having a final push but doing it from  days out which isnt common. The prediction is putting it down mostly as a late bloom in general popularity so its still expecting a further increase push. Obviously something I need to look into modelling a better.Ill be interested to see what happens over the next  hours to this campaign to see if the rate sustains or if it drops and is an early final boost.,ThemsFightinHerds,cw5ib82,1,t5_39qs3

5598528,0,t3_3rppto,The skullgirls community option actually brings up a good point. Im now curious how many people from that community actually joined this one.,ThemsFightinHerds,cwr1u87,2,t5_39qs3
5711774,0,t1_cx4unn0,I dont know about something weekly that could be a bit bothersome for them. But I too feel like some way to maintain hype throughout the development period would be good like a monthly or biweekly update on how things are.,ThemsFightinHerds,cx53nqk,2,t5_39qs3

6420322,0,t3_43lrkt,Man the lore in this game just gets better. Drive some pity towards the Predators? Not something Id expect. Glad theres more information on The Hold.,ThemsFightinHerds,czjebxw,5,t5_39qs3
