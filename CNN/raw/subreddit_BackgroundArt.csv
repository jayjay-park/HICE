1739640,0,t1_cjyfbzw,Definitely  it manages to capture a lot of the whimsy and fun of the original series while still delivering a dark and mature story in the same vein as Book . There are a load of awesome new characters some beautiful settings more family backstory for Mako Bolin and Lin and it ended this week with a finale which imo trumped Sozins Comet. Youll love it!,BackgroundArt,cjyg1k4,4,t5_2yh4t
1888772,0,t1_ckgr4ii,No problem Im pretty sure it was weird even by Japanese standards since it shows some Western influence as well. Its from the same company as Ghost in the Shell and directed by the guy who did Serial Experiments Lain if youre familiar with either of those. ,BackgroundArt,ckgsem1,1,t5_2yh4t
