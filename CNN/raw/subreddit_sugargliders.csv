130363,0,t1_cet7ksa,Im actually sitting with them right now. I tried using two separate dishes to feed them and that works until I leave the room then he starts going at her again. So right now Im sitting here with them and occasionally he will go at her when he does I tap on the cage to try to get him to stop. I have no clue if its helping or anything haha,sugargliders,cet9zgo,1,t5_2sg83
135584,0,t1_cepzoct,Thank you for the detailed information.  Im  still tossing the idea about but now theyve since said that it would only be one theyd be giving to me and that its a boy. Something that could cause all kinds of other problems added into the mix so thinking about it for a bit. ,sugargliders,cetvfoe,1,t5_2sg83

723079,0,t1_cgmf5ae,Thanks!Theyre mo OOP and we got them from The Pet Glider Priscilla Price. We didnt handle them for the st day as directed. Theyre already getting better its just a tough phase.My understanding is that TPG uses bottles with all their gliders so they should be accustomed to them. Ill try adding some juice and if that doesnt work Ill try the bowls. Ive been told to be careful with bowls as if they accidentally defincate in them they could get really sick.Thanks again!,sugargliders,cgmgu9j,1,t5_2sg83
2247997,0,t3_2kvy0f,We have both in our home and they are nothing alike. Which pet you choose depends on what you are looking for. Gliders live  to  years hedgehogs live about  to . You need two gliders so they have a buddy hedgehogs are solo animals. They actually dont do well with other hedgies. Hedgehogs do well with a cat food diet supplementing meal worms and limited other treats. Gliders require a highly specialized diet. Do you have more specific questions? ,sugargliders,clpknag,6,t5_2sg83

2639496,0,t3_2q5ift,Male babies tend to go through two toothy phases. Once when theyre small and again when theyre teenagers. Spending more time with him is definitely a good idea carry him on you as often as possible That will help build trust and eliminate any fearful biting but otherwise its a fairly normal behavior for his age. He should grow out of it. I second the motion to get him a mate a.s.a.p. Having a companion is crucial for gliders and will help improve his demeanor and eliminate the stress of being alone.,sugargliders,cn344mu,2,t5_2sg83
3085439,0,t3_2vbs9p,I adopted my two gliders when they were about a year old. What I learned was time. Its takes a lot of time for them to bond so be patient dont force anything. Ive also heard people say they arent bonded till they like to be held in your hands. That is wrong. One glider hates it but loves to always be on me. My other glider when he is sleepy loves for me to hold him in my hands.Just be patient dont be agressive. It may take time one glider took  months the other .,sugargliders,cohsyo5,1,t5_2sg83

3786011,0,t3_33rzkp,I dont have names for them yet but Im already in love! Theyre two years old and are actually very tame and have no problem being held petted etc. Theyre chowing down on some apples right now and they seem to enjoy being petted while having their dinner. Theyre on a towel for the moment until their fleece dries. Theyve got a huge cage to run around and explore in with lots of toys. I am so excited! ,sugargliders,cqnu2hr,4,t5_2sg83
3956515,0,t3_35rqte,She needs to be put on a staple diet right away or risks developing metabolic bone disease. I use the BML diet because it is fairly cheap  ish for a months supply and is made from mostly grocery store foods. The staple diet achieves the  calcium to phosphorus ratio that gliders need. Suggies should always be kept in pairs but if you give her lots of attention she should be okay until you are able to afford another glider. Standard grey gliders go for . As for the licking she is grooming you you are one of the colony to her  the chattering is a greeting sort of like hello!. Id hate to see you give the suggie up because she already seems quite taken with you. But if you cant support her properly then it is up to you what to do. I can break down the monthly cost of my two gliders if you want an idea of how much money youre looking at having to spend. To entertain her a wheel would be great but do not ever get a Wodent wheel these have literally killed gliders by pinching and ripping out their tails. Some safe options are Stealth Wheel and Raptor wheel. I have loads more info if youd like I can also link you to some helpful websites. Im a member of a Facebook group called Gliders of Today and theyre extremely helpful for when you have questions or anything. Feel free to send a request to join. Anyway good luck and let me know if I can help ,sugargliders,cr79yob,1,t5_2sg83
3957540,0,t1_cr7884p,I have pretty much all day with her. Everyone brings their pets to work and she seems to love meting new people. There was a bonding pouch left with her things but she would rather sleep in my shirt most of the time. Ill definitely get some bird toys! I bought a couple of ferret items from the pet store including a cloth tube and a fabric nest thing I stuck an old shirt in. She burrows into it at night when I put her in the cage so I can sleep. She does like to chase bits of sting and wooden pencils! Shes a bit like a cat in that respect. Ill see what I can find next time Im at the pet store.Shes been licking me all over! Im glad its a good sign!Is the HPW like the BML diet? Im trying to give her variety I snag free samples of fruit for her when we go to the grocery store. Yes my former roomie was a pain. Im happy hes finally out. Thanks for the advice!,sugargliders,cr7e5xv,1,t5_2sg83

3976770,0,t1_cr9kwzj,Yea I was reading that anything lower than  would require a heat rock. Im in the southwest so its not going to get under  for the next few months lol...ideally we will have an indoor cage and an outside play room. The lowest we have our ac is  for the most part but Im guessing I can buy a heat rock wherever reptile stuff is sold.,sugargliders,cr9l377,1,t5_2sg83
4152147,0,t1_crtaa4m,Dont worry about that give them a few days to settle in. Theyre probably a little over whelmed with all the new sights sounds and smells.,sugargliders,crtk46b,2,t5_2sg83
4181872,0,t1_crwv85s,Awesome. I just looked and you seem to have some pretty good prices. I need Trim Trax for my Stealth Wheel. Your website says the trimmer starter is a  pack. Does that mean its  sheets for a  wheel? Think I might get some yogurt drops too.,sugargliders,crwxqhp,1,t5_2sg83

8369060,0,t1_d5ninrd,Thank you Ill definitely look into this one more! It looks like what I have without the cross axel. Is it heavy? My only worry about it is I have her in a inexpensive bird cage for now so the wires arent real strong. ,sugargliders,d5nolah,1,t5_2sg83
8575403,0,t1_d6dei37,OP if youre reading this you NEED to get another one.I know I know I cant afford it. Then you cant afford to own just one.  Save up do your due diligence to that animal and get himher a friend.  Please.,sugargliders,d6dib2s,3,t5_2sg83
8663584,0,t1_d6ojo3c,She was seizing on and off all day too. I just held her and cried for awhile... I really do miss her though. Im sorry to hear about your ferret. Ive always wanted one and when I do get one Ill be sure to go to a trusted vet. ,sugargliders,d6oke0d,1,t5_2sg83
9283416,0,t1_d8spybp,Thank you! He had so much personality and spunk more than any other glider Ive ever seen. His colony and I will miss him a lot. He had been diagnosed with liver cancer a year ago and kept right on trucking only becoming really ill in the past couple days. Other than that he had a long happy life!,sugargliders,d8sqnxv,2,t5_2sg83
9346096,0,t3_58hhhq,Mine do fine with car trips we are normally traveling when they sleep anyway. We usually keep things that have their scent in the travel cage they mostly act like nothing is different.,sugargliders,d90onwl,2,t5_2sg83
