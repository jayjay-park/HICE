9198372,0,t3_56benn,A port from the Cossacks Back to War mod Imperia would be fantastic. Not only did it add the th century but the AI saw massive improvements along with other neat features. I cant quite list the site at the moment since Im on mobile but a quick Google search should help.,Cossacks,d8hym7q,1,t5_2xal4

9981885,0,t1_db86r3n,I think it is possible to win if you focus on stables and artillery especially multibarrel and normal cannons. Also Russia has pretty good heavy armored horses and the ability to churn out mass musketeers be sure to build lots of houses for population cap. Also most noobs forget that they can collect massive amounts of stone with the  upgrades from the academy and trade to mend their gold problems. Mercenary th century are also pretty good but dont build them to soon since they cost gold per minute. Try to have  stables  townhalls and  artillery depots at  min. If you cant do that work on your macro. ,Cossacks,db8o1zy,1,t5_2xal4
