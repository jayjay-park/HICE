179890,0,t1_ceo0d12,Id read up on the history surrounding WarZInfestation at the earliest convenience. Here is a good start The game was plague with poor decisions with public relations and game design mechanics. You should always make your own decisions of course but personally Id stay well clear.,SurvivalGaming,ceyxb8c,1,t5_2xqag
250454,0,t3_1wxtyc,Yeah nope buying equipment with real world cash does not equal a fun survival game ,SurvivalGaming,cf6pppb,5,t5_2xqag
1340281,0,t1_cik81m8,Ok.. thx anyway.,SurvivalGaming,cikeb2w,1,t5_2xqag
1670220,0,t3_2czh7x,Base your decision on one simple question did you start playing dayz when it was in its infancy? i.e. the mod? If the answer is yes my advice is to ride it out for awhile. Aside from the aesthetics and more enterable buildings theres really not a whole hell of a lot to do in the standalone. If however you havent played the mod then you might enjoy the game in its current state. ,SurvivalGaming,cjpoyq3,1,t5_2xqag
2267961,0,t1_clpl5at,NEO scavenger is by far one of the best survival games I have ever played. Project Zomboid is great too but I have not played it in a while and the last time I tried to it did not have that much content ot mess around with.,SurvivalGaming,cls1fui,1,t5_2xqag

3789447,0,t1_cqo34uc,Interesting. Its not purely survival in nature but something like this sounds interesting for an urban pack or so.Thank you! I am writing this down.,SurvivalGaming,cqo86ml,2,t5_2xqag
3853485,0,t1_cqvig34,Wow thanks. I forgot about project zomboid I picked it up a long time ago and have not touched it since was just waiting for it to release. Think ill see what has been done lately. As for the other games they have been added to my list of games to check out this weekend. ,SurvivalGaming,cqvj6t7,2,t5_2xqag
3862239,0,t1_cqvg1y4,Yeah I made a similar request thread last night when someone reminded me of how Skyrim can be a great survival game and Ive been playing it all day. Get these mods which I consider essential for a survival gameplay Frostfall  Makes Skyrim cold so that you have to maintain your body temperature using campfires etc. and adds tents for camping. I recommend turning off fast travel. Hunterborn  Adds hunting field dressing butchering skinning. I recommend playing with the lowest yield amount of meat so youre not too OP on the food front. Realistic Needs and Diseases  Adds hunger thirst and sleep. Hunterborn RND Frostfall compatibility patch  Makes the mods play nice together. Alternate Start  Live Another Life  Skips the intro tutorial and lets you choose an alternative start for roleplay.Prerequisites SKSE SkyUI wMod Configuration MenuTheres a lot of other nice mods that you can find in the Immersion area on the Nexus and Im especially fond of the Skyrim G.E.M.S. website that adds to the survival experience I play with about  mods tweaking for realism and graphics enhancements but the ones I mentioned are the ones I personally find essential. Im working on putting together a list of recommended survival mods that I will post in a thread here soon.,SurvivalGaming,cqwj2pj,5,t5_2xqag

5496606,0,t1_cwdgb1f,Once maybe. But long term no it doesnt.There is no successful outcome in a PvP survival game. You either stop playing the survival part and start PvPing or you quit the game. In both cases you drive other participants away until you have the exact same game as an empty counterstrike server.,SurvivalGaming,cwe8s2s,0,t5_2xqag
5869641,0,t3_3vd8ic,Its great so far. Reminds me of Legacy Rust but better.,SurvivalGaming,cxp1hbv,1,t5_2xqag

7834890,0,t1_d3wciy9,So you havent actually played . for yourself? Ive gone from  to  in the wilderness and from like lt  to  in cities. Thats more than playable and thats just the first iteration of the new renderer too.,SurvivalGaming,d3wpjpk,1,t5_2xqag

9420117,0,t1_d9a1de6,Yeah actually thats one of the reasons a lot of people bought it because they assumed it would be like FOS but for the PC obviously they were wrong but eh.Also  dollars I think is a fair price for the game get yourself a copy and chime in tomorrow with what you thought of it.,SurvivalGaming,d9a2cg8,2,t5_2xqag
10195771,0,t3_5lthiy,If you ever watched the HBO series Deadwood thats basically the setting here but more in the open unsettled parts. I just hope they stay away from adding any steampunk elements or anything else that doesnt fit in a realistic  North Dakota setting.,SurvivalGaming,dbzqw9x,1,t5_2xqag

10927402,0,t1_de72tto,Definitely. Ive played Rust and Ark and for sure Rust is better suited for solo even though a group no matter in which game will always have an advantage over a solo player. Ark leveling system gives groups a huge advantage with the shared XP.,SurvivalGaming,de732h7,1,t5_2xqag
11383236,0,t3_62dr6x,Not really sure why the downvotes.   This happens more often than you think.  Shit SOTA asset flips all day.  Granted they said they were up for using premade assets but they are charging real money in their shop.   ,SurvivalGaming,dfm9qzf,2,t5_2xqag
