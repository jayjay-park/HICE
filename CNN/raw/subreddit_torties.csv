Give her a toy and shell play play play. Reliably at  am she wakes up to just yowl for a few minutes. Damn I love this lil nut.,torties,dga2ova,3,t5_2tt9j

I can hear the strands breaking and I have a couple little patches of randomly short hair in strange spots on my head.I either have to sleep with a hood pulled up and tied around my face or with a knit hat on. Thanks tortie!,torties,dgjv5t9,3,t5_2tt9j
