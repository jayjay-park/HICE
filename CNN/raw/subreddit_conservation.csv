2492797,0,t3_2o5p69,Apparently we have this ridiculous activity in Canada as well.I had no idea. I find this pretty hard to take killing animals as a social activity as described in the original posted article. Good to see it may be banned but I would expected a strong backlash.Whats the story with coyote populations? Do they become pests because they breed like rats pests because of something we do or is it more that we crowd them out and farm animals are just easy pickings? And I suppose those could be the same thing in a sense.,conservation,cmjy31y,5,t5_2rbpn

4703073,0,t1_ctnbz7z,It is difficult to find info. I cant really go into too much detail about my volunteer experiences due to the operational security of the properties we were invited onto and the IAPFs methods. And as a foreigner there were certain antipoaching related things that we were not allowed to do but could assist the rangers with. If you have specific questions about operations or the rangers you might be able to get ahold of them via email or through their Facebook coordinator. Im not sure how they respond to that thing and they are usually pretty busy with fieldwork.You might also do some searched for South African antipoaching units ignore the ecoresorts that offer customers a chance to walk with AP rangers on the Africa Geographic blog they might have featured or mentioned some organizations in South Africa. I know some Zimbabwebased organizations have been mentioned there including Chengeta Wildlife Rory Youngs organization which is known for their success in MalawiOne thing I will say about Protrack is that they are essentially the University of Phoenix of antipoaching. They are accredited for certain firstaid and firearm training but not antipoaching nor law enforcement. They have one of the shortest AP program lengths with essentially no emphasis on learning anything about the wildlife they are supposed to protect. They turn out some of the least experienced individuals and their employees in Hoedspruit where theyre HQd have been known to run over wildlife on reserves they were operating on. I dont think youll find much information on them due to their work ethic.,conservation,ctncys4,2,t5_2rbpn
4743253,0,t1_cts0bd0,Alright. I read your article and watched the trailer. I am being dead honest and not trying to be a dick in reviewing your article and the trailer. So take this with a grain of salt. First you have a grammatical error in the second paragraph second sentence. Its nothing major but it puts me off reading the rest of the article. Honestly in the back of mind Im thinking Okay he didnt put enough time into reading his own writing why the hell should I. Then I think Ah fuck it. Everyone fucks up. And I keep reading...Second dont be cheeky with titles. IMO that detracts from your actual article. What I thought of when I read your title here and in the actual article was Personal Trainers Hate Him! CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT WHY! You seem creative enough I read your LinkedIn profile to draw the attention of potential readers without stooping to this level. Third why not try to get comments from people who live in Louisiana Mississippi Alabama and Florida? I understand that its salacious that BP doesnt want to comment and sex does sell. However if you wanted to draw attention to this event and the subsequent impact on people down there this many years after the fact why not contact the mayor of New Orleans congressmenwomen business owners etc. to get a reaction to the film or highlight their suffering and struggles? That would have added substance to your article IMO. Finally this article comes off as more of a review of a movie staring a onedimensional actor with a terrible accent than a piece to draw attention to the facts surrounding this disaster. Add more to your article about the plight of the people living on the Gulf Coast more people suffered because of this spill than just residents of Louisiana to get more breadth on the current situation. Best of luck.  ,conservation,ctsfjw6,2,t5_2rbpn

A note of feedback Id be more inclined to share a video like this if you added a sentence for each species about how severe the population drop has been. Though we can be bombarded with facts I think something like has suffered an  population drop since  or whenever resonates more than just hearing that the species has been downgraded from endangered to critically endangered.

If a construction company needs to work by a stream occasionally rather than have their own professional biologist  ecologist on hand at all times they can hire a consulting firm to do the assessments for them and provide them with a report that they can use for permitting and whatnot.There multiple aspects to consultants ranging from aquatic assessments restoration assessments water quality ecosystem management etc.A big one off the top of my head is Triton but not sure where you are located so it may not be relevant but look into them to get an idea what they do and where you can look for similar stuff.,conservation,ddgvtpc,2,t5_2rbpn
