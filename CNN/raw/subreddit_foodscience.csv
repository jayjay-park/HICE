201686,0,t1_cf1exr1,ampampampHeres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Sugar substitute  gtgtA sugar substitute is a food additive that duplicates the effect of sugar in taste usually with less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are in general called artificial sweeteners.gtAn important class of sugar substitutes is known as highintensity sweeteners. These are compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose common table sugar. As a result much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds the sweetness profile is sometimes notably different from sucrose so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most natural sweet sensation.gtIf the sucrose or other sugar that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product then a bulking agent is often also needed. This may be seen in soft drinks or sweet tea that are labeled as diet or light that contain artificial sweeteners and often have  ...

2998385,0,t1_co7tcm6,Im actually at Montclair state university and will do. Im waiting for a reply from one of my advisors. I know one student who is in her last semester currently and was given an internship with a company working with food technologists in my area. So I contacted the adviser who helped her. Hopefully all goes well and I can get into something similar. ,foodscience,co8s3wf,1,t5_2qrx6
3641039,0,t1_cq76gni,Learning how food works is probably the most rewarding relevant and pertinent science to learn that is also fun!  If you graduate from a decent program with a good GPA and have some internship experience you can get great job out of the gate. I think a lot of food scientists form this unrealistic image in their mind as they go through school that they will invent cooltrendy food products that are technical marvels the world has never seen before.  Most product developerRampD people in food companies do very little actual food science.  They are project managers.  Sure they do formulation work and such but from then on out theyre grinding.  Coordinating with plants marketing QA etc.  Theyre trying to get things onto a shelf.  The big companies have RampD people that do really long term research almost crossing over into academic style research.  Thats the fun stuff but they usually all have PhDs.  With you background in pastry I think you might find being a research chef an interesting route to go.  They usually have degrees in culinary and a certification from the RCA  A degree in food science and background in culinary would probably be very competitive for those kind of jobs.  Research chefs get to create things without the overhead of taking it to the shelf.  They usually consult with and pass projects to the product developers to do that.  If you dont mind sharing where are you attending?,foodscience,cq7b0w3,4,t5_2qrx6
4273657,0,t1_cs7bryp,The job prospects seem pretty good. We have very close ties to industry and the department does a lot to help you build a network. We have an advisory council that are a really helpful network and companies come every  weeks for infosessions. A lot of students go into RampD for food companies mostly big ones like Pepsico amp Kraft for product development or to dairy companies DFA Glanbia Lactalis Rich Foods Great Lakes Cheese etc. for quality RampD amp safety. A handful go to Gallo each year for oenology. About  go into government with FDAUSDAstate Ag. Some go to academia too though those jobs are getting more and more competitive. Just about everyone I know in the grad program got placed somewhere upon graduating.,foodscience,cs7cxn0,3,t5_2qrx6
4664221,0,t1_cticdny,Get in touch with professors before applying. Read about what kind of research labs do read their recent papers and contact professors and administrators to set up tours. You can ask about funding and tailor your letter accordingly. When you reach out to faculty send your resumetranscript whatevers relevant. Dont wait for them to ask. They are all very busy and have no clue who you are. Theyre also people and some are dicks. Most are nice though.Your research area can be broad just specific enough that you can identify it as a real field not something so vague as chemistry or food science. Something like rheology or flavor chemistry should be okay though if you have a really specific interest that aligns with faculty go for it. It should obviously be something that someone at the school does and you can identify  faculty members youd want to work with in your letter of intent. You should also have at least tried to speak or email with each one before applying.Your letter should explain what you want to do and why youre the right person to do it. It should also explain your motivation for coming to grad school and what you want to do after. Its your only chance to really say anything personal about who you are so write it well. Id recommend keeping it to  page. Have someone else read and critique it.,foodscience,ctihauf,1,t5_2qrx6
4935656,0,t1_cugcbqy,Thanks thats a real compliment considering I only have  months exp in product development and it was  years ago.I worked in an rampd lab finding food applications for fish oil specifically beverages. Thats where I learned a lot about pasteurizing and aseptic filling most of the other stuff is from what I learned in the last  years of earning my degree.Keep fighting the good fight. People will sometimes look at you funny when you say youre majoring in food science but its a fun and interesting field that applies to many things in everyday life outside of your job.,foodscience,cugog5o,1,t5_2qrx6

5716310,0,t3_3tcuip,I dont think its something that would make or break your resume. Will it look good? Of course it will but taking that course is a rather large expense for a student. If a company is willing to hire you then theyre most likely willing to also pay for the course. I was hired right out of school into an entrylevel tech position and my company paid for HACCP SQF and internal auditing training for me. I would say as long as youre familiar with basic HACCP principles and can demonstrate that to the employer if it came up in an interview you can hold off on the certification until youre hired.

5828117,0,t3_3umxn5,Hey casualapathy I would recommend reaching out to raskreddit as you will touch a broader audience.  I only found this sub after searching through google and there are very few users in this sub.  Askreddit might offer a better economy of scale.As an aside Im a Chemical Engineer working primarily in an Electrical Engineering domain.  It only takes that first step to break into a new industry.  Be very willing and upfront about your desire to learn and take on new challenges.  That first step is the hardest but once you get past it youre golden.Good luck in your search.,foodscience,cxjlbc3,2,t5_2qrx6

7556213,0,t1_d30zny3,Indeed panel work is hard work. Ive only done consumer panels myself a few times but they were aalways a bit of a nightmare.  I blame myself for being inexperienced at the time but also because i was dealing with the wrong consultants that brought me the consumers because no matter what type of population sample you ask for they always brought whomever they had available and then the consumers were invariably of the lowest segments of the population D and E.  Sample size was usually  or  and this led to plenty illegible incomplete and unusable forms which killed my sample size.  So i stopped doing panels after a while the data wasnt much use to me anyway and inviting company staff from finance and logistics to the lab to do sensory for me turned out to be very good barometers for consumer tests.But thats just my experience in the third world. Maybe its different in other countries.,foodscience,d313slf,1,t5_2qrx6

Any suggestions for imorovement were dismissed because I held a job that any highschool grad could.Then I managed a restaurant for a while and now Im in mechanical engineering because its easier than chemistry and there are a lot more job openings at the lower level.,foodscience,d5yn5gp,1,t5_2qrx6

I am currently in my BA at a small college doing Sociology and feeling like I really want to do Food Science but I am teaching myself and just taking Intro to Chem and other random electives around my required courses as well as just cooking a lot. Just trying to figure out how to get into the field without having to do a second Bachelor degree.  I have heard about Cornells food science professional studies masters which just requires  science degree credits but it is SO expensive. ,foodscience,d67v93c,1,t5_2qrx6

It is time that is the problem I only have a prac session for two hours every second week.The other option is to divide the sample in half run half through the amylase and the other half through the protease and recombine them for the ashing.  We are not doing this exercise fully quantitatively just enough to give the students a taste of extraction and testing of macromolecule fractions.,foodscience,d6ow472,1,t5_2qrx6
