11446352,0,t3_6395mz,Id give her a chance before going to a supervisor. Tell her you want to talk about dividing your work in an equal way and you two can come up with a plan for that. She might just be in a slump and need some motivation. If she doesnt seem receptive to doing her share of work then you can give her hints that youre going to eventually go to your supervisor. That may get her in gear. If it doesnt to to the supervisor. I just try to work things out as much as possible on my own without involving managers or such. ,Intheoffice,dftfmsi,1,t5_2w9hc
