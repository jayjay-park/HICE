145942,0,t3_1vr43y,Norfolk will feel much smaller than SF. Our downtown is a relatively small area easily walkable in a day if you were so inclined national recording artists play our venues The Norva being the most prominent with some frequency but we are often skipped in favor of DCRichmondCharlotte NC etc. That said the area has a lot to offer especially if outdoor activities are your thing. The proximity to Virginia Beach with the touristy Oceanfront as well as more secluded locals beaches and First Landing State Park is nice Norfolks Ocean View area is a bit seedier but also has beach access and some nice watering holes. The Ghent neighborhood has lots of locallyowned eateries bars and other businesses that are definitely worth checking out. There have been plenty of posts in this subreddit regarding our favorite restaurants clubs etc. so Id suggest a few carefully worded searches or just browsing back a few months to see whats been discussed.Cant speak to if Norfolk is southern or not except that no one can drive worth a damn even on a clear day. Rain or worse snow which is rare but not unheard of will really stretch your commute out.Thats the last main point Ill make  driving here sucks and tolls are coming to a couple of our tunnels starting Feb .

The news article I provided still included a scene of the area  address  information that the subject was arrested and the victim will survive. Your post did none of that.

9112991,0,t1_d877tcp,Well I guess were going to have to agree to disagree because I see far more racism in Well they must be talking about race because they are talking about criminals and thugs than in saying what you are claiming they are saying.  You say subtle racism but you cant point to anything racist without jumping through hoops that requires your interpretation of what theyre saying.Also to immediately jump to an argument about crime when talking about a transportation initiative that links a city with more crime is suggests that they know that Norfolk has more crime than Virginia Beach.Im sorry but while I support a light rail I really dont want to get it simply because we have falsely painted the opposition as racist.  BTW Heres data on the crime in our city vs. Virginia Beach.  Pointing out that we have more riffraff and thugs is just factual not racism.  Its racism if they connect it to race in any way but even you say that they havent and that youre adding that interpretation to their words.,norfolk,d878g1p,4,t5_2rt3o

10507833,0,t1_dcz3k23,We didnt have usaa for banking but we had them for insurance. My gripe was that everything customer service wise had to be called in. I had a slight payment issue on our account where it double withdrew the payment. The brick and mortar branch couldnt answer my question they had to put me on a video chat thing to get someone from their corporate office to answer it. Navy federal on the other hand has several branches located throughout Hampton Roads. If I have a problem most of the time it can be answered by going into the bank itself and theyll fix it. I dont think that Ive ever actually had to call navy federal besides one time on vacation when I lost my card and a branch wasnt close by. If your card is missing or stolen they can cut you a new card right then and there. The atms are kind of old but I use the mobile app for everything else. We have an auto loan through them too. Their rates are very competitive and they beat usaa by a full  on our new truck plus a  new loan or refi bonus paid out in  days. Also notary services are free there if youre a member. Theyve also let me use their fax machine when I had to fax something so that I didnt have to go to FedEx or ups. We also get discount on our auto insurance for being a navy federal member. ,norfolk,dcz69zv,3,t5_2rt3o

But you would go with a group of friends and do VR stuff the whole time with like arcade stuff mixed in. Interior lighting being led focused. People could pay by the hour or something. Start up cost would be high but once equipment  is in place i think profits would be high.Im just spitting ideas. Marketing it as the only arcade on Norfolk or the only real arcade in the HR area.
