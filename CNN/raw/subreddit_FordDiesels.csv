433970,0,t1_cfpqnxb,Thanks. Im just thinking if I spent between k on the truck and then have things rebuilt it would still be cheaper than buying a  truck of the same model. Plus I just like the way those older ones look better anyway,FordDiesels,cfpquye,2,t5_2w9bc

2560471,0,t3_2o8ho4,The turbo on your truck is easy enough to remove and quick. Pop it off check your veins and control ring and make sure the bearings and the wheel spin free and doesnt wiggle or oscillate in any direction. If you can get a better video with someone holding the phonecamera by the engine thatd help. Hard to hear where the noise is coming from but Id bet wheelbearing.,FordDiesels,cmssgwg,1,t5_2w9bc

4259631,0,t1_cs5rqma,I spent a lot of time reading about it when I started buying high value equipment. Im fairly young and want my stuff to run forever. The major difference between diesel oil and gasoline oil is the additive package. Both types of oils have very similar additives but diesel oil has been allowed to keep some ingredients that gasoline oil has removed or greatly reduced because of EPA regulation. So in using diesel oil you are just getting additives you wouldnt get in gasoline oils. The detergents are also more harsh but all this stuff has to stand up to specific certifications and there shouldnt really be a downside. In fact diesel oils can even be safe for wet clutches or transmissions so I run it in my Honda Foreman. There are a bunch of ratingscertifications on the back of Oil that you can look up what they mean and whether or not they will be safe for the use you are planning. The only argument I have ever heard against is that the combination of synthetic and higher detergents could potentially clean the engine too fast and cause clogs in oil passages. However modern oils have been pretty clean for a decade so you just dont see engines with a quarter inch of sludge built up in them these days. So i would rate this highly unlikely unless you dump it in a car from before the s maybe even before s that has never been rebuilt. Ive heard this argument quite a few times but have never seen evidence of it actually happening.  ,FordDiesels,cs5s20u,1,t5_2w9bc
5169466,0,t3_3lrew4,It sounds beautiful. Do you get that growling noise in low gear at low speed? Ive heard it called gear rollover but Ive never found a solution for it.

7213155,0,t1_d1y10s5,Ford has changed the spec according to some TSBs I have seen about  times between ATF and MTF. I do not know off hand what the spec ZF actually called for but it is what I used. It was not quite  weight but it was a bit heavier then Mercon V. It shifts the same cold but warmed up she is a lot smoother. I know on my fathers Ranger the in that Ford says should have  but Mazda says it should have . A lot of the Ford fluid specs were for CAFE they wanted to up fuel economy as much as possible and their severe duty read actual truck stuff fluid specs are different as are the MFGs of some of their manuals transmissions. ,FordDiesels,d1y2vls,1,t5_2w9bc

7652201,0,t3_4fz9up,PLUG IT IN or youll have a hell of a time in the winter. Starting a truck in an Orlando winter is nothing compared to Michigan. Takes way more to start it. Also another thing is in the winter run some degel in the fuel tank. Once you hit  degrees which you definitely will that diesel will turn into straight jello not the tasty kind,FordDiesels,d3c0gtc,1,t5_2w9bc
8042378,0,t3_4p7gyc,I had a bad FICM It tested Okay but I replaced the power supply in it for  just to confirm as it was the cheapest of the options and a known fail point and it worked beautifully. It would sort of work but it would lug and be a very spiteful thing. Its easy to change out and if your other soft checks dont show anything its a reasonable first step to try.

8591236,0,t1_d6fhatt,You bought the truck used yeah? The previous owner had a light bar or something else mounted up there and those are to plug the holes where the wires went in. I wouldnt recommend trying to remove them unless you like a moldy wet headliner. P,FordDiesels,d6fhtbg,3,t5_2w9bc

10469267,0,t1_dcuoe6u,So split shot is one thing but it cant very precisely control injected quantities. for the pre and main injection pulses. The on time is loosely fixed could in theory be shortened by shortfilling on the inlet stroke but cant be lengthened limited by plunger stroke and the off time between strokes is purely determined by plunger velocity which is a function of oil pressure. The fixed off time isnt always right for the area of the torque map youre in thus performance can be optimized further with more precise fueling control. From what Ive read Caterpillar has a way though both their HEUI and MEUI systems to control whether or not they use the split shot type injection and even use a pilot and main instead of just a splitshot. ,FordDiesels,dcusrci,1,t5_2w9bc

10576883,0,t3_5rfwxu,I use an SCT X tuner as my gauge set and it works perfectly. I have  gauges that can be set to monitor almost all of the trucks major sensors. I would recommend this for any one even if they want to use the stock ford tune.

10646428,0,t1_dddxyna,Its a good idea to. Most kits include it.. kind of. The EGR block off plate I purchased had a mounting hole for one then you took a EGT sensor off the DPF and installed in the hole. You plug it into an existing sensor in the truck... my MiniMaxx was then able to read that sensor.. some other tuners youd have to hardware it to the tuner or use an interface kit,FordDiesels,dde3iez,1,t5_2w9bc

10725293,0,t3_5tb2f6,Always start with the basics! Air I have seen more than one . not start because of a completely restricted air filter. Fuel does the fuel pump run when you cycle the key on? Sufficient fuel to the fuel filter? Oil your injectors are controlled by high pressure oil and wont run if oil is low enoughalthough you said you changed the oil. .s had a lot of problems with cam position sensors but most were corrected when they recalled the old style sensors. Leaking IPC sensors can cause some issues but unplugging them will let you start and run the engine with the PCM just running on default values. If that is all good my best over the inter web diagnosis would be a concern with your under the valve cover wiring harnesses. The valve cover gasket acts as a connection between your engine wiring harness and the harness under both valve covers for the injectorglow plug circuits. These will very commonly become disconnected either fully or partially and will cause rough running or a crank no start concern. Pulling any DTCs and performing an injector buzz test using ford diag equipment would be the easiest method to determine if Im right or just pulling the valve covers off and seeing if you connectors are partially disconnected,FordDiesels,ddm8fv0,2,t5_2w9bc
