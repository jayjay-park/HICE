Even with Ben McLemore already in his th year everyone is waiting to see that next step where he goes from a small contributor to a major contributing role player before becoming that reliable starting player. Or he could just be a mediocre player for the rest of his career. It sometimes makes the rebuilding process really difficult to enjoy Malachi will probably need to either prove himself or be sent to the DLeague a bit and then Buddy Hield will be playing with the pressure of having to turn out more than a good player considering what was all traded away for him. Ill go with Buddy Hield on a  either he ends up being an amazingly talented player or he ends up crashing and burning like Anthony Bennett I dont know if theres an inbetween choice for him given the circumstances.,SacramentoKings,de0b9dc,3,t5_2qzqo
