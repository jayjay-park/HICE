8096575,0,t3_4pjp6z,. Lineysha Sparx Season  th PlaceIt is time to say goodbye to one of our Puerto Rican beauties Lineysha Sparx. From the moment she entered the work room to the time she sashayed away Lineysha was consistently one of the most beautiful queens the show has ever seen. However due to her quiet nature and even quieter personality it is time for Lineysha to say her goodbyes. Lineysha enters the workroom in season  in a stunning yellow dress a face beat by a whole damn stampede because that shit is flawless and hair styled beautifully to match everything else. Next she takes a quick swim in a tank of water and scores an absolutely stunning photo of her underwater. The whole theme of the first episode seems to be robbing Lineysha of a win because her photo should have won the challenge. I love Detox but nothing could beat just how beautiful Lineysha looked underwater. In continuing with the theme of robbing Lineysha of her win this episode the queens are challenged to create a look using fabric and materials from a dumpster. Lineysha turns out a completely flawless dress. Not only way the dress stunning but it was creative as hell too! I mean the bitch wore a shoe in her hair and made part of the dress out of wallpaper but for some reason Roxxxy wins the first challenge. I normally dont agree with people when they say Such and such was robbed during this or that challenge. BUT Lineysha should have won the first week hands down no discussion case closed. However she is just marked safe and makes it to week two. Week two begins with yet another mini challenge that has to do with Rupauls album Available on iTunes now and Lineysha doesnt do anything particularly memorable during this challenge. The three winners from the mini challenge then end up being team captains for the main challenge The Lipsync Extravanganze Elaganza. Despite language barriers that may exist Ivy Winters picks Lineysha to be on her team first over many talented queens in the cast. This ultimately helps boost Lineyshas confidence despite Vivienne literally bitching about Lineysha at every opportunity she gets. After delivering a flawless pink bathing suit number on the runway the judges decide that Lineyshas performance in the challenge and her runway constitute a win for her team and ultimately decide that she is the winner. Going back to the theme of robbing people of wins in season  it is my personal opinion that Coco was robbed of a win in this episode due to poor performances by other queens namely Monica. Thats beside the point though I guess the judges felt bad for robbing Lineysha in the previous challenge so they gave her this one. She ends up scoring immunity with her win which ends up coming in handy. Week three starts with America Junior Drag Superstar challenge which Alaska and Lineysha manage to win with everyones favorite Lil Poundcake. However when I say that Alaska and Lineysha win I just mean Alaska because Lineysha didnt seem like she did shit for the mini challenge. Due to being a winner of the challenge Lineysha is put in charge of being a team leader and ends up selecting a pretty weak team minus Jinx and Ivy. Even Ivy is a maybe on that though After a pretty poor performance with Ivy making banana splits and a decent runway look. Lineysha is marked safe by the judges but only because she had immunity. Overall this is not a good sign for the future. Episode four is the infamous Black Swan episode and Lineysha is selected to be on Jinxs team. Lineysha is assigned to be The Supremes Diana Ross a role which she doesnt particularly understand. Really I dont have much to say about Lineysha from this episode because tbh she didnt really do much this episode. She didnt stand out in the challenge itself and her dress was meh. Overally Lineysha managed to slip under the radar this episode simply because two people really bombed the challenge and their storylines had to be played up. Finally we have Snatch Game which in all reality I was very surprised Lineysha made it to. While she is a very beautiful queen the work she was outputting in the previous episodes really wouldnt justify her making it to Snatch Game in any other season. However Lineysha tries her hand at comedy by performing as Celia Cruz. When none of her jokes land and despite her serving decent look for the runway Lineysha ends up in the bottom two lipsyncing against Detox which was basically a death sentence. Lineysha sashays away but not in disgrace but as a beautiful queen who made is quite far in a season of much talent. Overall Lineyshas time on Drag Race was much longer than I had originally thought it would be. Regardless of how beautiful Lineysha is she just did not deliver consistency in the challenges she went from a win to being completely saved from possible elimination in the course of two challenges. That is not to detract from the innumerable talents of Lineysha though. However it is in this inconsistency that I find fault and that is why I believe it is time for her to go.
