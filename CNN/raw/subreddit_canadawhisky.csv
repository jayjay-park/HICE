5741371,0,t1_cx8fci8,Give me a fucking break. Alberta Premium is bottom shelf. CC is bottom shelf Crown Royal is bottom shelf RampR etc. This is not the bottom shelf of Canadian ryes. Its the low mid range. Its right around on par with wisers legacy in my books and for  less. In a country of sweet garbage shit whiskey this stands out. Is it great? No. But its half decent. Not to mention its really light tasting for a mixer...,canadawhisky,cx8rtvi,2,t5_34k59

8390003,0,t1_d5q8ba5,Hello thanks for your reply. As I wrote Im a bit too old for this modern mode of communications but am giving it a try. I live in NH but its still a  hour drive to Montreal. Am going to NB next month to see the Bay of Fundy which has been on my bucket list for years. I was on rscotch but I didnt find anything other than archived discussions that were interesting to me and of course I couldnt join those discussions. It may seem stupid but I have no idea how to Post a discussion thread. Can you point me in the right direction?While its true that there are other scotchs than Laprhoaig Ill just say this. Once upon a time I was into bordeaux cabernets. I toured and tasted at all the major chateaux I bought futures for delivery after release I consumed a different vintageproducer every week sometimes three times a week and read every book on the subject I could find. In the end I spent tens of thousands of dollars on wine. Some of the bottle were unbelievable such as  Lafite Rothschild. Others were totally unremarkable. After  years of this I switched to chianti as my goto wine because it was just a lot less mentally taxing. Or maybe all that bordeaux ruined my brain?. And it was consistently ordinary. So as I said Ive tried a couple dozen different scotch whiskeys in my youth up to age  and when I had my first taste of Laphroaig I became a total adherent. There are so many different styles of Laphroaig that even having one dram a day it would take years to run through all the different bottlings you can get assuming you get about  shots per cl bottle. Im sure that Im missing something but I think I have my hands er.. mouth? full already. I have three unopened bottles of different Laphroaigs here now and several more that Im planning to acquire which seems like months of pleasant drinking already. I suppose its like cars or women. You just pick the one you like the most and stay with it. Okay maybe thats not entirely true for cars as they wear out. Maybe the women was not exactly the right analogy either. LOL. But for scotch Im satisfied. I dont go to bars so dont really have the opportunity to taste a random bottle now and then. And anyway the bars around here think that the top shelf scotch should be John Walker Black. Which is their premium brand. Nuff said?Ill be going to London in a few months but I was planning to confine my drinking to bitters as thats something that we cant get here at all due to the fact that English bitters dont travel more than  miles without going bad. And at my age two pints puts me under the table. TMI? Thanks again for your advice.,canadawhisky,d5qaqkb,2,t5_34k59
8403354,0,t1_d5rt5bi,Well I actually purchased ! But I have one more reason then just wanting a really good whiskey to drink. See I was in Dillons Distillery way back before they had actually opened to the public. We were doing a wine tour in Niagara and on of the wineries told us we needed to stop in there and check the place out. Soo....Well because we were with a very recognised tour person we were brought in got a tour of the facility got to try some triple distilled right out of the vat and while there I bought a trio of their Gin Vodka and White Rye. When I got home I then noticed all the bottles I bought were from Batch . In hopes that these guys would become successful I never opened those bottles and instead went back  months later and bought the same trio to drink this time they were batch   and  respectively. Sooo good thing I saved them. After todays Purchase I will now have in my collection a Dillons Batch  Gin Wh Rye Vodka Cherry Vodka Pear Vodka and their latest  month Aged Cnd Rye. It was nice to see them get this far and still be succeeding more every day.I stopped in to Dillons this past April while doing another wine tour. My hopes were that this rye would be ready for pick up as I had been emailed about it the month previous. Well it wasnt but when we were in the back touring around again Geoff was back there with a couple of the whiskey barrels beside him trying samples of this whiskey. I tried hard to sway him to let me try it he just grinned and have me the NO NO not yet finger and tried another sample right there in front of me. Little bugr eh!!!Cant wait to try this stuff I have only been waiting  yrs for it. Hopefully it gets here before I leave for vacation this would be so nice to take with me when I go!!,canadawhisky,d5ryrbv,5,t5_34k59
9367519,0,t1_d939iwf,thanks for the info. regarding the age discussion i agree its the distillers choice to put out whatever they feel is best into the market but given the typical whisky consumer believes olderbetter you may find it difficult to market something with  months on the label. ,canadawhisky,d93eeu4,1,t5_34k59

9845541,0,t1_daqoifb,My teensearly s was a big long binge. Home by  drunk by  asleep by  repeat. Drank at work probably twice a week and was stoned every moment I was awake. My roommate kept stealing my beer so I switched to whiskey which he hated. Figured out pretty quickly you cant function as a whiskey drunk so moderation came around. Whiskey saves lives and LCBO is insane. ,canadawhisky,daqwasc,6,t5_34k59
10379194,0,t3_5omiwy,I dont think the one you got is the new release if its the same green label. The LCBO has ones with a new label that look similar to the label that had  on the label but without the  on it obviously. They also had a sale on Lot  recently and I think that must be why. ,canadawhisky,dckjnkp,1,t5_34k59
