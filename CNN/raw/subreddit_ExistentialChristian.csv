1934908,0,t1_ckma0ct,gt Its not an assumption. Omnibenevolence is inextricably part of the identity of God unless youre doing that empty waste of time Eastern philosophy gibberish.True but what I was getting at in my first comment was that it seems there are conclusions that can be drawn from the article that seem to question the principles of God. I arbitrarily chose to question the benevolence when I could have questioned the omniscience omnipotence or my conclusion from the article. So since I was questioning the benevolence of God I didnt think we should use the benevolence of God as a given. Also Im not aware of this Eastern philosophy gibberish you speak of so maybe you can fill me in haha. gtYes. It may be the case that its not possible even for an omnipotent being to create a world with as many freely saved people as there are in this world without some freely rejecting salvation.Why do you think it isnt possible? I know the article was about God being hidden but God could theoretically be known to everyone and then every sane person would believe right? The number of people who wouldnt follow Gods word having absolute certainty of the reality of heaven and hell would have to be incredibly low. If were still maintaining Gods omnipotence and omniscience then God could choose not to create those who would not believe even in such certainty. I see no reason that God couldnt find that balance where everyone is saved. I dont see any contradiction with omnipotence there either so if He couldnt create that world then Id have to question His omnipotence.Even with God being hidden I dont see why He couldnt populate the earth with only those who would believe and follow Him.Actually when I think of a Rube Goldberg machine I think of a series of causes and effects that are designed to result in one final intended event. If you think of the world as a Rube Goldberg machine could God not have set it up with the right starting conditions and right operatorshumans knowing how they will react so that He gets the desired outcome?I have not read Plantinga. Is he a philosopher or christian apologist?,ExistentialChristian,ckmcctd,1,t5_33k3z
