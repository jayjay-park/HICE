1344699,0,t1_ciimnu7,Wow I wouldnt go that far.  Definitely no hero here.    But thanks for the compliment. Giving up your car for a dream and putting  of your energy towards your dream...now thats hero worthy!  I totally agree with your sentiments about only working for what you need.  I find its often hard to find likeminded people.  Keep your head up and save up for something local to where you are.  That reduces travel costs.  Often times you can learn from many cheaper avenues.  For example I joined a particular group on Meetup.com that was interested in natural building and sustainability.  One of their free events was an open house for a straw bale home.  Things like that sometimes pop up. Also you may find volunteer opportunities on sites such as Poosh.org  Just to learn about buildingframing etc. I also just started to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.  Its all knowledge that can help.  May be a tiny house might be a solution? Additionally I will try to document my experience and share it.  If we dont have a dream to put our energy towards...whats the point right?! ,Strawbale,cikw7js,2,t5_2sgdw
2499239,0,t1_cmkh3me,We are going to do a build in the spring in NorCal any insights you can give to the process?We too have the full set of Andrews DVDs and I have been on a workerbee to get handson experience not with Andrew but using basicially the same techniques. The DVDs that relate to our building method have been great! Our builder has liked them too.,Strawbale,cmkseem,2,t5_2sgdw

We have so many regulations nowadays but everything has been standardised nationwide which has made it pretty afforable to get a buildingpermit and grants the local government less bullyingpower.,Strawbale,cp25o8i,1,t5_2sgdw
8402322,0,t1_d57npmf,As far as I know the land registry covers that in England. Not that I can afford to buy any  I was just wondering on the gap in the situation. More stuff is of course community or group based. I wish people would rent natural builds too though affordably where they have the land to build on and the structure or as the outcome of volunteer work. To date Ive only found a natbuild renting once and that was the tale of a farmer and his selfbuilt cob house who rents it to a farm hand. ,Strawbale,d5ru4ha,1,t5_2sgdw
