1111781,0,t3_26upom,Completely legal Im in the Army Of Mordor and most of us blood up with a bunch of fake blood and some face paint before fighting at most reasonably sized outdoor events. Unless you have an allergy to something in it a unitmate does and she just refrains from putting it on herself it wont cause any problems at all.Ive got a two year old bottle of the cheap shit from WalMart and I use it at every event I go to and the occasional practice.,dagorhir,chuo1sq,2,t5_2si7f
3193281,0,t1_coslxwl,well I would imagine it only being up to like  points for anything metal. Leather   chain plate etc   kind of thing. But I really guess the more I think about it the more I understand it not being tiered.,dagorhir,coszey1,2,t5_2si7f
3496080,0,t1_cpqrg24,There is really no good reason not to get the lacrosse or street hockey gloves.  They dont really have any drawbacks are comfortable and reduce risk of hand injury to nearly zero.  They are just a little expensive but if you buy good ones they will last forever.,dagorhir,cpqs146,1,t5_2si7f

6805349,0,t3_48yk54,Hi there! I make and sell garb at events and through my Etsy shop here I have some basic items listed but Im always willing to do custom work and I can give you a discount for ordering multiple items. I dont currently have toddler garb listed but I could certainly make some if you get me some measurements and roughly what style you want for it!,dagorhir,d0noiwp,3,t5_2si7f

7137627,0,t3_4dbmve,Actual leather. Cut properly with rivets or woven with leather strips. Long leather belts tied in a proper knot. Id say shoes are one of the hardest to land. If you go with the times you end up with a pair of nice leather boots with a slick sole and people will undoubtedly slip. If you go for tennis shoes you wont fall when it rains but you look like an ass haha. Saw someone who took fake fur and wrapped it around a pair of high top work boots and secured it with leather strips. It looks nice but it can slide down and its a pain to take off and put back on.,dagorhir,d1pgy5h,2,t5_2si7f
7394167,0,t3_4etuei,I do not remember and cant find it But a friend of mine turned the Rick Roll song into a healing poem and we Rick rolled weapons check. Pretty amusing. Also a funny one if your looking for something a little less serious isWhy the fuck you dying why you always fucking dying. Oh my god stuck fucking dying You have to say this  timesNow go die some moreJust a funny one I had written a while ago with some friends at camp. Best of luck finding the right healing poem for you! ,dagorhir,d2io1zj,2,t5_2si7f
7412810,0,t1_d2kqfbe,If youre happy getting a few kills in a day of fighting a lot of deaths and causing some laughs then go for this. If you want to focus on being a part of a unit and consistently contributing to that units victories its not a good idea. To some people thinking tactically and doing their best to win is a part of the fun. To others being unique looking cool and getting attention take priority. ,dagorhir,d2ksdak,4,t5_2si7f

8941536,0,t3_52o4yk,Nope. We sort of got out of the Badon habit a few years ago when we decided it was time to boycott Pioneer Park. Just havent gotten back into it. Honestly most of our postRag energy goes into Clash of Kings now.If you want a good event in that area and time frame hit up Pentwyverns Harvest Feast instead.,dagorhir,d7mn2yu,2,t5_2si7f
