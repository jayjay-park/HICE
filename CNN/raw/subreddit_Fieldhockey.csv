8920296,0,t3_52dkqq,With younger kids the importance is making it fun so its useful to make little games to play. I would work on push passing more than other types of passing at that level because its easier and its more useful to learn it properly. Maybe get them into groups of two pushing the ball to each other and slowly getting further apart remember that the power comes from the legs in a push pass so teach the importance of transferring weight from back leg to front leg. Other than that what Lasssslo said...maybe make some assault courses to practice all of the skills that they learn at the end of the session?,Fieldhockey,d7k37tl,2,t5_2t9k0
