9684903,0,t3_5dpyq7,Im not sure.  I tend to believe him based on his reaction to his daughter and the fact that he was close to death.  Even though he heard is daughters voice calling him back as she is now.If you take it as he didnt know when he discovered the police knew about the first murder which could be explained as a sex act gone wrong added to the video tapes of him addressing the viewer and his past sexual abuse I think it was undeniable.  He chose to kill that guy because of what he did to the kid sister.  It is possible the trauma caused him amnesia and they couldnt do an MRI scan initially.  Its also possible that he started to remember anyway.  He is very manipulative so we can never be sure.  As you say its totally possible hes lying and his survival instinct is kicking in.   Its weird he saved the woman from her abusive husband.  I think irrespective he accepts that his compulsion and sexual fantasies took over.  When he beats Stella we see the unadulterated rage triggered because she presents his past laid bare.  I guess it could lead to discussions about his mother her suicide and the anger he must have felt being abandoned and forced to survive enduring sexual abuse as a result and whether he was destined to become what he became.They play it so we can never fully be sure but I am sure he accepted it.,the_fall,da6vazu,3,t5_34al9
