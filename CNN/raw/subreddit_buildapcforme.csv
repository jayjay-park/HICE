7548,0,t1_cef9lvf,Yes its true.  The GTX  is a pretty powerful card.  Itll handle Metro Last Light at about  FPS on high Bioshock Infinite at FPS on Ultra etc. etc.  There are other benchmarks in the link I provided as well.  It also has PhysX which will allow you certain cool effects in games.Remember recording video during games may be detrimental to your performance but with this hardware you should be at least at a playable FPS with very high settings on most if not all games even while recording. ,buildapcforme,cefano5,0,t5_2tjcr

172810,0,t1_cey23xf,This is really confusing because Windows  and Windows  have difference licensing terms. I was thinking about  Windows  because I currently own it but after reading this I found out about the Personal Use License in Windows  and how it works. It does seem like you are correct in saying that as long as you use Windows  not  for personal use you can wipe the hard drive and use the same key on another computer.However if the OP bought the computer from a major company like Dell Lenovo Gateway etc then here is what it says There are additional licences distributed by large OEMs that have their own contracts with Microsoft such as Dell HP Lenovo etc.. Those remain more or less the same and will not be covered by this answer. As long as you buy the licencedisk separate from the computer it is under Personal Use not OEM. So basically if you bought a prebuilt computer then you cannot transfer the key no matter what but if you previously built a computer yourself and wanted to reuse the key in another build then all you would have to do is wipe the drive and use the key on the new computer.

Yes while z is an overclocking chipset OP isnt necessarily buying it for the overclocking feature op is buying it because it has features such as SLI that will allow him to upgrade it in the future. Lastly I saw someone running an i and a gtx Titan on  watts a nonoc i with a  nonoc  is going be fine. If op wants to put in a second card at a later date then he can use an EVGA w psu that is lower quality than the seasonic but it gives him the option to put in a second  without upgrading any other parts.,buildapcforme,cf0hf3p,1,t5_2tjcr

It also out performs all AMD and past Intel CPUS rd Gen.The motherboard has the ports slots and components needed. It also supports crossfiring so you can have more than  GPU. I managed to squeeze in a TB storage which is more than enough space. If you find that you dont need all that space then replace it with a TB and save yourself like . The case I chose is the same as mine. Good enough space and enough room for you to place your parts in easily. Although you can get cheaper cases but obviously they arent the most aesthetically pleasing. Corsair is known to have good PSUs so this one should do you just find.

This will be my first real pc build as I havent built more then a basic web browsing pc and that was  years ago. Is there anything you could suggest that would make it cheaper and a way I can use my tv as a monitorsound system?

753788,0,t1_cgpn4xq,Taking a look at your PSU looks quite durable so you could use that. The best way to tell a build IMO is to look at other builds at that price point. For example you may see that many  builds use an i processor or fx  for the CPU. These are the best priceperformance for this price line. They are chosen depending on what the user is going to do with them. Since you mentioned you wanted to stream games I chose the fx  because its core count would help over the more powerful  cores. RAM is basically just RAM. You cant really go wrong with brand just make sure it is compatible. Most gaming builds will need at least gb of it  is ideal.,buildapcforme,cgpynl1,1,t5_2tjcr

757769,0,t1_cgqeoaa,You could and it would save you a good bit of money. But you will take a MASSIVE performance hit. The  will  net you maybe rd of a X can offer. Most likely  the effective performance. It will also be somewhat useless for aiding photoshop as while it will help it would help nowhere near as much as a even a mid range AMD card due to the fact that Photoshop doesnt take advantage of CUDA cores and Nvidia OpenGLOpenCL performance isnt as good as AMDs. If you are wanting to save money a X or  would be a better choice. EDIT I will admit I exaggerated a bit about the performance loss. Its still substantial. but not quite as dramatic as I made it out to be. After checking my source it would be a little under half the performance of a X.I totally Understand if you want to save money. I put together another build that will still perform very well without as big of a performance loss.

Heres my rec  I added the parts youve already picked out yourself though to tell you the truth you didnt need to get such a pricey PSU. As for CPUmobo compatibility you just have to make sure they both have the same socketplug  for example the AMD FX uses the FM plug whereas the AMD Athlon X uses the FM plug so they would need different motherboards.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchant  BenchmarksType|Item|Price||CPU | AMD FX .GHz Core Processor | .

I also included a TB Western Digital Blue HDD for your main storage Western Digital is very high quality and the Blue drive is perfect capable for a basic drive.Video Card For the GPU I went with the GTX  the reason for this is that you have dual monitors if you only intend on gaming on one monitor then a GTX  is perfectly sufficient future games may be more intensive at p so they may also take advantage of the s power.Case Basic all black case like you wanted if you want something that is maybe a little nicer you can look at brands like Corsair NZXT Cooler Master and Thermaltake. This one was just cheap nice and fit the application.Power Supply You might be wondering why I went with a W PSU this is just so in the future you can SLI you said you wanted your PC to be as future proof as possible so this will definitely help with that aspect.OS . as requested personally I like . better than  though that is highly debatable . can also give a slight boost in performance in some games.Montiors I went with two .in p monitors for you you may want to go to a larger size but that is up to you ASUS is a great monitor manufacturer so quality is not an issue you might also want to give up some response time for an IPS display but again that is up to you.Keyboard and Mouse The Ducky Shine is a top of the line mechanical keyboard and of very high quality blue switches while very loud are at the moment my personal favorites. For more checkout rMechanicalKeyboards. As for the mouse I went with the Corsair Vengeance M Mouse I went with this personally because it is fairly cheap and is a great mouse.If you have any other questions do not hesitate to ask.,buildapcforme,ch2e5f2,3,t5_2tjcr

1022626,0,t1_chkiwym,I would recommend going with an iGB instead to save a little but ultimately its up to you. The  ti is a good catch though I would personally go with the x yeah Im cheap but for only a little more than the x Ill leave that up to you. Most Z boards are the same specwise but MSIs Gseries and ASUS Maximus VIVII series are geared more towards gamers with features like better overclocking control fan control optimization etc. MSIs Gseries boards are solid performers though and if the Z generation is anything like the Zs its a pretty good buy.

1117870,0,t3_26wpsf,I originally had a more balanced build but then decided to focus on providing the most bang for your buck. Since you already have an SSD and OS and you dont care about the case  can get you quite far. In Short I couldnt help but put in a kickass video card. The processor is great for gaming and general computing and it is overclockable. If you do end up overclocking I would recommend getting the Corsair Hi or some other closed loop water cooler. The only other thing I would add is another Seagate Barracuda in RAID  but I got rid of that because I would rather add another HDD later than replace the graphics card i.e. I got rid of the second HDD to make some room for a better GPU. Also definitely put your OS and the most data intensive games on the SSD.You could also go with the EVGA GeForce GTX  GB Superclocked ACX Video Card which would put the build at . and give you quite similar performance. That way you could use the remainder for another HDD.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchant  BenchmarksType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core iK .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

It might be a bit more but thats up for you to decide if its worth the money for a nice speed bump.Also an nvidia card might be preferable depending on what software you are using for video editing.

1418118,0,t3_2ado6c,There is absolutely no way you will get two monitors a keyboard a mouse a tower and OS for  or less. I dont want to sound like a dick but to expect to be able to do so is ridiculous. Even with a prebuilt PC with the two monitors youre spending around ish at a minimum. After paying for two monitors youll be left with around ish. Now subtract under ish for the OS unless youre okay with pirating it. And then subtract another  for the peripherals. Suddenly your budget is around ish. To build a pc with ish practically impossible. To expect a  GB SSD is ludicrous. Honestly I cant tell if youre trolling or not.,buildapcforme,ciu1fnm,2,t5_2tjcr

1554020,0,t1_cjaxg25,You are absolutely right about the GB SSD. I copied most of this build over from a previous one and did not look close enough when I was done. I was happy that I got an R  monitor  OS at this price so I completely overlooked the GB SSD and just blindly went with it that it is a solid choice. Forgetting that he still had budget left over. Edited it in now I went with the MX. This is one of the better SSDs out there for the price imho. And I am a personal fan of Crucial. Adata Sandisk Crucial amp PNY are all good brands that I would suggest depending on price. Did not edit the PPP link tho I allready made a new build and im lazy! Yes the R is massive overkill right now. So it will last a long while if he stays on p. Thats for sure. Future games will be handled better by an R then an Rx. Technically my idea was for that  mm fan to place it on the side panel as an extra intake. To blow fresh air into the GPU. And having only intake fans is perfectly fine to do. This way the case will have posetive air pressure and the hot air will escape from where it can. While new cool air gets pushed into the case. But he could tinker around with the fan to see what would give him the best temps. You are right tho having just  single mm intake fan would be slightly low and would for sure have a relatively noticeable impact on the overall temperatures. ,buildapcforme,cjb2j07,2,t5_2tjcr

1683047,0,t1_cjr243x,How many times do you use a storage device to transfer data from and off your PC? Thats the only time where you might get some benefit from USB .. Sure the R is a better case. It is as well much bigger. Its all up to you in the end. Yes I would suggest at least  intake fans mm frontside and an optional mm exhaust fan at the rear. That mm in the rear is likely not that needed. it would only help the PSU a little bit and slighly the CPUGPU tempatures. I would actually consider having a look at the Fractal Design Arc Mini case. I would personally rather get this one over the R. You can get for  at azerty.nl  free shipping. For some reason tweakers.net isnt suggesting to buy at azerty at all in the shipping price checks. Cases is most of the time personally preference. So I can only suggest things that will work good enough. When I dont have a large budget I cut the costs down on most parts to get the best GPU into the system. All the time when I make a build  I start off with keeping the costs as low as I can get it. Then after I got the full build. I see how much money I got left to see where I can improve. ,buildapcforme,cjrb7f8,1,t5_2tjcr

1808244,0,t1_ck6h7sq,The more I talk with you I feel as Im learning more but Im becoming acutely aware of exactly how much I dont as well! Regarding obsolescence I think you make a fair point and my desire to purchase a desktop that will remain state of the art for a few years was rather delusional considering how quickly technology in general is evolving. Well you certainly know how to alleviate my worries because I feel having heard your testimony that I SHOULD be able to set up my own PC but whether I will actually do a good job is another question. Speaking of questions what is a p monitor? I tried googling it and it didnt help much. Thanks again for the sites that you showed me. Logical increments as well as toms hardware proved to be incredibly useful and like you said they seem to give more realistic reviews of the tech. So I went back to the drawing board and having returned to my senses sort of came up with the following set. Again your opinion on it would be hugely appreciated. I wouldve loved to have the Sapphire Radeon Rx as you had originally linked but I think its been sold out hence having to resort to what I picked. Also when I picked the Saphhire Radeon it said that some of the driver bays may be unusable due to its size. Apart from that Im quite happy with the set up Ive chosen but if Ive overlooked something or I can get something for cheaper Id love to know about it.After this I plan to spend another  with which I would need to buy a monitor probably a cheap BenQ  x speakers microphone and webcam  all of which I have looked up on Amazon.,buildapcforme,ck72edz,1,t5_2tjcr

Lateryears down the road most likely you can always by another hard drive. You can have quite a few more. For the ssd if you do buy it gb is kinda small. It will allow you the install your OS and at least  games though which should be fine. Some games see decently lower load times others dont really need the extra speed.Other than that you can hold out on the video card and look for deals. The  wont age well but for another  or so you can get at least a good x. If you look around online you can find a better video card. IMO micro center kinda has a poor selection of video cards. Places like newegg or amazon can afford to have larger stocks which means you could find a better video card at a slightly lower price.This is a better card for a similar price which can be bought either from amazon or newegg.Also when building watch where you put your harddrives as sometimes video cards will be long and block off out of  slots of your hard drive bays.,buildapcforme,cllkwsc,2,t5_2tjcr

Your next upgrade should be a better video card when you have the cash.  I was trying to piecemeal a computer together for you and with a full build youd be making a sideways movement in terms of performance or only a slight upgrade R was the best I could do with a complete system rebuildI went from a ti to a  recently and havent changed anything else running a AMD FX right now. You have a good enough CPU now to benefit most from a GPU upgrade but if you are stuck on going miniitx I would deal with the performance and make the motherboard and case changes then move to a GPU next time. ,buildapcforme,clp1ec3,1,t5_2tjcr

Great for gaming! Its unlocked as you know so overclocking is possible.  CPU Cooler Went for a nice white CPU cooler from Phanteks. Its slightly on the more expensive side but it performs very well in return. Here is a great review.  Motherboard A very nice black and white board from MSI. Decent onboard audio but not the best. SLI is available so dont have to worry  about that.  Memory RAM is RAM. The only thing that really matters is capacity. For gaming GB is enough for editing GB is enough but its nice to have GB. So I went with the Avexir Core xGB MHz CL kit. Wich got white LEDs on it that breath. Wich will look nice.  Storage GB SSD amp TB HDD. Went for a samsung drive as you requested. This one is very solid for the price.  Video Card Went for the Gigabyte GTX for a few reasons. The GTX is an amazing card. The gigabyte version is as well very good. It as well is black with white LEDs  on it. So that is a plus.  Here is a nice review of this card.  Case Went for the NZXT S. Its basicly a mini H. Here is a great review of the case as he does mention about the HDD. I would suggest to mount the HDD before the PSU this way you can screw it in very easy! And here is a look at the system that I put together kinda. The video is mainly about the motherboard.    Case fans Kept the stock fans as they are fine. Do not use the molex connector however as this will force the fans to run at V. Just use the pin connector. I would however remount the top exhaust fan and place that in the top front as intake.  Power Supply  year warrenty  bronze semimodular W PSU from EVGA. This PSU is a pretty solid one  year warrenty means that they  build it relatively well. Its semimodular as well so you wont have a lot of cables to hide. Cables I went full mode for the black and white theme here. Bitfenix extensions are of very good quality and not that expensive either. Its very simple to use as well and will work. Here is the link to the webshop where they are selling these. I would highly recommend to not buy from Razer. I am sorry. But I am not a fan of Razer. They sell because of marketing. Not because they have great quality products. They are as well way to expensive in my opinion. I can suggest you a nice keyboard and mouse if need be. That monitor as well isnt that good. For xp you dont want to go over  in size. I personally prefer  at most. I have a  monitor but its xp. If I turn it to p it looks terrible. The pixels get stretched out and its just bad. This monitor would be much better. Adjustable stand USB hub and not oversized. Not sure if you need a pair of headphones but if you do the Kingston HyperX Cloud Are amazing for the price and in black amp white! Here is a nice review of this product. Hope you like it and If you have any questions dont hesitate to ask. ,buildapcforme,cmmemda,2,t5_2tjcr

2613091,0,t3_2prckm,I took a slightly different approach to the other build offered to you. The main differences are that I chose a Haswell Refresh CPU instead of Haswell so its slightly newer. To go with the newer CPU I chose you a H chipset motherboard instead of B. H is newer than B and B is sometimes regarded as business class although its fine for gaming too. I found savings in other places which allowed me to include a x instead of a  video card.You will definitely get better performance for your dollar building a computer yourself instead of buying from over priced gaming PC builders online or instore. I live in Vancouver and Id be happy to help you out with the build if you need it. This build does go over  before rebates.

Its a locked model so no overclocking. Motherboard  Basic model since youre not overclocking and you dont need a ton of features. RAM  GB is the standard amount for most gaming builds which is more than enough. Storage  GB SSD for your programs paired with a traditional TB . harddrive for massstorage needs. Graphics card  Somewhat of an older model however still a very good performer. Given that youre mostly playing LoL its actually quite overkill but it also allows you to play some more demanding Steam games as you mentioned. Case  A white Phantom . Not sure if you wanted the fulltower version but its a bit more expensive and I personally would not recommend fulltowers due to their much larger size. Power supply  Basic Corsair unit to power your system. Has semimodular cables to help with cable management and cable clutter around the case. OS amp wireless network card  Pretty selfexplanatory. The wireless network card is an internal one so you plug it into the motherboard. Monitor recommendation  This kind of depends on how much you want to spend and your viewing needs. For games like LoL or any twitch  reaction based game a monitor with a higher refresh rate is ideal i.e.  Hz or higher to achieve unparalleled  smoothness while playing the game. If youre interested in better colour reproduction youre generally looking at monitors capped at  Hz but with a better colour vibrancy and viewing experience i.e. IPS related monitors. There are options that combine both but are rather expensive. Lastly theres the super highresolution i.e. K but requires a decent amount of hardware to make it worthwhile.,buildapcforme,cnf4l0w,1,t5_2tjcr

2819462,0,t1_cnofesp,Compatibility notes are not critical. The first means that the case has no frontside USB. The second means you will have to remove additional drive cage to install the GPU. R  are indeed long GPU and this happens quite a bit. It will all work no problem. You can pick another case if you like bigger andor with usb on the front. Case to the performance is pretty irrelevant as long as you manage good airflow,buildapcforme,cnokdlq,1,t5_2tjcr

Hopefully OP isnt using chromes CPU of a hog browser too... OP requested a full tower w LEDs. Please refer to rule  for build contributors.All messing aside this is a strong build and will work great.  As a user of OBS and twitch and the like i do recommend more memory but gb can be fine if you manage your tabsprocesses while streaming.  I would like to see a full tower here but honestly OP this case is a pretty strong value and has the LEDBlue theme you want.  I know im busting uMorganC s balls but only because they rode in on their high horse.  Also isnt that a crazy good deal on the PSU?  And FYI OP you may still be bottlenecked w a  core hyperthreaded CPU while streaming some of those games.  Those are some resource hogs youre going to stream.,buildapcforme,cnosogw,2,t5_2tjcr

2828517,0,t1_cnph2tb,Thats all I needed to know. MiniPCs usually come with laptop hardware in them... Not the best of the bunch either. Ill put something together I think the LGA  platform is best suited for your needs since you can upgrade it. AM will offer slightly better performance but youll have to buy new CPU and mobo next time youll upgrade because the FX is the best that is available and is about as fast as an i in renderings. Ill try to squeeze in an i but most likely youll be getting an i Both can be upgraded to an i or Xeon. Thanks for being specific about the workload It really helps a lot.Main BuildIts the cost of the OS over budget but I really think it wont be benificial to go with anything lower. Windows . because they arent RAMlimited  Home Premium caps at GB which is important to the programs youll be using.If you cant strech the budget opt for this alternate build instead but dont expect graphical performance to be anything more than absolute necesary.It should render quicker but the working enviroment should be singinicantly slower due to the lack of a proper GPU only intergrated GPU. For this build youre looking at a GPU upgrade. With both builds youre looking at expanding the RAM modules same ones for up to GB and the CPU i or Xeon with Hyperthreading.Dont upgrade the CPU or GPU before youve added at least one RAM module The higher bandwidth and space will offer a more consistent working enviroment and will cut down rendering time with some apps.Unless you really arent expecting to work with long renderings and youd prefer a smoother enviroment the main build is the best choice.Check with rbuildapc for sanity check.,buildapcforme,cnplint,1,t5_2tjcr

The i has hyperthreading which would make tasks like photo or video editing faster but if youre just gaming and streaming you wont see any noticeable difference in an i vs. an i whereas upgrading the GPU to a  will give you better fps at higher settings.I should also note that the SampH of this build would probably bring you a bit over budget.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core iK .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

2972201,0,t1_co1b7b2,Alright thinking of going another route what do you think? Posted this on buildapc under build help didnt get any feedbackRecently acquired an old pc  Was wondering what everyones thoughts would be to possibly recycle it and use it for an HTPCSteam box. I was wondering what kind of graphics card I can install without experiencing bottle necking cause of the CPU Athlon II x  . ghz The power supply is only watt so I would imagine that would need to be upgraded as well. It doesnt have a hard drive so I will be adding one and running ubuntu so keep that in mind when recommending a graphics card. So is there still life in this machine? Would it be worth it? Keeping price in mind since this was acquired for free dont want to dump a bunch of money into it. Thanks for any help,buildapcforme,co5ydfw,1,t5_2tjcr

2992239,0,t3_2ugelf,awesome ill work on this. Ill see what I can do with the budget. Just to answer a few things allready.  overclocking letting components run beyond their specs that are provide by the factory. CPU RAM GPU are the  main components that you can overclock. This will give better performance ill give you more info in my post.  You can use the  plasma TV as secondary monitor.  I give a solid PC  years life time before it needs an upgrade. However in most cases the only  upgrades that you need are a new GPU and perhaps more RAM.   RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. In short you can set up multiple HDDs or SSDs to gain extra realiability speed or a mixture. More on that in my post.  CUDA after the Plymouth Barracuda is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA and implemented by the graphics processing units GPUs that they produce. CUDA gives developers direct access to the virtual instruction set and memory of the parallel computational elements in CUDA GPUs.

3012131,0,t1_coa6dun,These days GPUs are very great for editing because it shortens your render time a lot and btw thats a midrange GPU. The CPU he suggested was also great because it has a lot of cores although weaker than i cores and videoediting really likes that. Also I recommend getting a better motherboard and cooler so you can overclock the CPU and get a nice boost out of it  make the computer have a bit longer life span. The rest seems like a great build I might post something here too. Edit my build almost no difference. Only got you a better cooler and a smaller SSD but in turn this SSD is a lot higher quality Kingston kinda made a big mistake by replacing their parts with crappy ones without telling us. Resulted in shorter life span and slower readwrite speeds. PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | AMD FX .GHz Core Processor | .

I actually was very surprised at that date when he came with those products as I dont think its optimized well and the GPU couldve been a lot better. Anyway ignore it! Building a PC is basicly the same the wires did not change and the process is not changed either. You can skip the stock intel CPU cooler part and instantly install the aftermarket CPU cooler. This is just easier for you so you dont have to clean the thermal paste  later. Wich would cost you another  or so.  How to overclock my CPU Basicly pretty much this Very solid and simple to follow guide. This is done with an Asus board so it will be slightly different with our motherboard. Slightly different names and they are often on other places etc.  How to overclock your GPU Hey guys this is Austin! It really is very easy these days. I highly suggest to run  minutes stress tests in between changing to a higher frequency. After you hit crashes and artifacts. I sugges to go down  steps or at least MHz on the core clock and MHz on the memory. Then do a full  hour stress test at least.  How to install Windows from an USB drive Here is a great video again!

3235238,0,t3_2x6bxh,OEMs are notorious for putting in shitty power supplies.So unless you are willing to upgrade your PSU you will probably be limited to ti which some do not require any special PSU each model varies so check before you buy they run directly off the pci bus for their power.  You also need to verify your pci is x or you will get degraded performance.A ti will run almost any PC game p max settings no problem and some games at p at about medium settings.If you have just been using onboard graphics you will notice a pretty significant jump in performance.  Just keep in mind that a ti is considered a low tier gaming card.  But for what you got it gets the job done.If you are willing to upgrade your PSU recommend at least W then it is just a matter of how much do you want to spend on a video card.Here is more info on the ti as an upgrade for OEM computers.,buildapcforme,coxc7j1,3,t5_2tjcr

3293824,0,t3_2xv5mq,If you know how to use Windows you know how to use linux. Its that easy. Problem might arise with some nonnative apps like Skype that require effectively a manual install which is a bit of a dubious task to do... Nothing that cant be googled though. Its a neat OS and the only reason I havent switched to it entirely is support for the games that I play. When I had an older laptop that couldnt run anything I had linux on it and it run faster because of it. It practically covered my needs completely save for gaming. So I really recomend trying out Linux and specifically the latest LTS release of Ubuntu before looking into alternatives. Heck I know I can fit the minimum performance needed in that budget with a Windows OS.Pros Fast SSD  GB xGB RAM stick that you can expand by adding another decent PSU.Cons Graphical performance is basic but can do K video and handle most desktop tasks. Percore performance is also slow but with  of them you are less likely to run into runtime bottlenecks for threaded apps... It can handle browser games.Notes The case is as cheap as it gets before going cardboard.,buildapcforme,cp3q0mt,1,t5_2tjcr

Besides you havent choosen an asus but a MSI this particullar board has nearly no reputationreviews only thing i could find was on Newegg and they arent possitive. besides that he can upgrade to octacores if he likes to or oc. furthermore he can upgrade the ram if he wants to gb he cant do this at your board. he aslo can go and crossfire it with a second  which would make it a k gaming rig but he would need a second PSU and AddPSU.

3615771,0,t3_31r0hn,I agree with uAphaBetaGamma that  way crossfire isnt exactly going to be worth it. With a dual card crossfire you see performance issues theyd only expound with  way. That being said fucking nice set up. Id recommend however you drop the audio card although its nice your motherboard is nice enough to have a very nice integrated audio chip that includes Dolby . support and tweaking. You can save that extra port for something else like a wireless adapter if you need it or another video card. Maybe a USB . expansion card if you dont want to upgrade so soon after building this beast.Id recommend getting either one of those xs or possibly two of these bad boys MSI GeForce GTX  GB cards Significantly less power draw significantly lower price. This would also keep your rig aircooled but if you want to go watercooled then thats up to you.Id add some HDD storage as well just because you dont see much performance increases with saving music video images or many programs onto your SSD itd be better to save all your games onto the SSD and OS and have it last you longer by saving everything else onto a separate HDD. Id also recommend a different power supply if youre going the route Ive listed I included a Corsair HXi in the build I have linked and a HXi for the watercooled edition. Braided cables as well because for another  it looks sexy as fuck and theyre easier to work with not to mention longerlasting and transferable to other corsair HXi or AXi PSUs if you decide to go with one of them.If you want air cooling Id go with this build which is what Ive detailed above.

It would be a little more work but in the end youd be able to move these water cooling brackets to other GPUs in the future making it a wise investment.IF youre actually convinced to use this water cooling setup Id run the mm radiator onto the back of the case the mm on top of the case to the top GPU and the mm on the bottom of the case up to the bottom GPU. To have the bottom mm radiator fit there is a peice designed to be removed in your case that allows for this size radiator to be placed in that spot. You could fit another mm radiator there but since crossfire and SLI dont pull the same load from each graphic card youll have less heat to worry about from the secondary readbottom GPU. Because of this Ive picked the smaller radiator in order to give you some space for your PSU cables which will take less space than stock cables if youve decided to use the braided aftermarket cables.There is a bracket for one of the original mm radiators for the x but youd have to purchase a bracket for the second one.Whatever you choose good luck and post pics on rbuildapc when its finished!EDIT Forgot aftermarket static pressure fans which should be quieter and better than the stock ones that come with the water cooling units. Plus they match the redblack color scheme of your MB.EDIT  uAphaBetaGamma pointed out that SLI s would run better than the xs would and after rechecking your monitors I realized theyd be near useless extra VRM so your graphic cards have been changed accordingly.,buildapcforme,cq4f9qv,5,t5_2tjcr

Some notes to follow Z and Hyper  evo both good for overclocking down the line BX is a cheap budget SSD  should handle most if not everything you throw at it I recommend getting a retail copy of windows or maybe if you have access to dreamspark or your company may have windows keys for employees. I dont see the benefit of the  buck Asus wireless card.  Unless you have like  walls this intel card should be good enough Wired card not needed.  Included in motherboard IO panel K is an acceptable keyboard corsair makes good peripherals.  Picked Cherry MX browns because theyre enjoyable to type on while good for gaming as well FK is my favorite mouse of all time.  I picked it instead of the FK because its larger and more comfortable to use at least for me.  Also you can find it on amazon hereI sincerely recommend waiting a few weeks to see when and if the xx series comes out from AMD not very likely but possible.  If there is anything enticing you may want to drop the  and go with something AMD has to offer instead.  If you are sure you dont plan on doing any graphically intense gaming GTA and CoD can be cranked up quite a bit something like the R  GTX  R x or the R  are all good choices as well.  Also before you buy the parts manually check the part prices using google.  PCpartpicker is generally very good at this but sometimes such as in the case of the FK it doesnt list some vendors.Good luck and have fun.Edit added info,buildapcforme,cq7e1z6,2,t5_2tjcr
3655101,0,t3_328n02,This should work great. For the cpu a pentium is all you need for movies and will handle any older or even modern midlevel games. The motherboard is nice and it features built in realtrek audio which is great I have the same one on my computer sounds great. Also in the future if you do get more into gaming the motherboard will accept any ii or i. In terms of ram  stick of gb is great this is more than you need and it will be easy to just put another single stick of ram in later if you need it. The case is where no money was skimped. Fractal design simply makes the best silent cases on the market you will not be able to even hear this thing. It is also a small case making it not to overpowering to the eyes. The hdd and ssd combo will work great for games the hdd will store them all the ssd can store musicwindows and such. Lastly the power supply is solid for this build no complaints there.

3663537,0,t1_cq9m1q3,Well thanks for the advice so far. I kinda already have something of a year plan laid out for buying components since you said the  isnt worth it Im going to go with the  and then purchase the most powerful CPU available for the Cannonlake series with the RoG motherboard available for it. I do want a custom loop for that but Id like to have one on my system already before that so I just have to empty the reservoir clean the loop and replace the CPU block. Its not necessary but I want to heavily overclock whatever I can.I really like my case and Im going to be using it even though its not optimal for watercooling. Im just planning for a custom loop that I can switch out the CPU block for to upgrade later. Ive actually got the radiators picked out but Im unsure of where I can find translucent red tygon tubing or a good reservoirpump combo and I have no clue what fittings I would need,buildapcforme,cq9v9dh,1,t5_2tjcr

Personally I think its a safe bet as later in the future if you decide you want to run sli gpus your motherboard will be capable and you wont have to drop money on a new motherboard. However if your ok with one gpu a MSI H might be a better bet. As for memory I run gb in my system and love it. I never have a problem with chrome with memory open. Of course I cant enforce gb of ram but it is a great amount more ram never hurts! Also for the keyboard aha you can go for your personal preference personally I have the microsoft one just because Im so used to it I type much faster on it than any other keyboard.

3906090,0,t1_cr1ht05,CPU This one depends on if you overclock. The  cant overclock and the k was made for it. If you dont overclock the turbo on the k will raise singlecore performance to .Ghz periodically and youll see a few FPS difference in gaming. If you do overclock the difference is worlds apart. Thats the real benefit of the k for the price of a few hours work manual or a button click automatic method you get an incredible increase in performance. Dont be scared to overclock either if you have the right cooler its simple and easy and safe for your CPU. I was afraid of it at first but once I actually did it I realized how little there is to be scared of. Even if you have no technical knowledge there are free programs out there that will overclock your CPU for you with the click of a button and leave it at safe voltages though for best performanceefficiency manual is still better.SSD  Evo is about  faster overall. That one is pretty easy. HDD Less of a gap more of a reliability and customer service issue. WD has some of the most reliability on the market and works great with their consumers which is pretty ideal for something holding your precious data. As far as the case goes a quality case can make or break a build. Bad cases have poor airflow and let in dust which not only harms your system but makes it much slower. Good cases arent much more expensive as a rule and should always be selected due to their impact on a build.,buildapcforme,cr1j1ih,1,t5_2tjcr

A file server is a pretty basic thing but if anything goes wrong it will be you everyone is looking at.You will pay more but the small extra expense up front is inconsequential when you consider potential downtime. Get a decent support contract so if something breaks theyll come immediately to get you up and running.Just my  cents.,buildapcforme,crdejlf,1,t5_2tjcr

This is a good one  but it is more expensive. That xeon can run  threads so it should be good for a long time however you do need to include something like the graphics card in my build as it doesnt include integrated graphics. As XorFish pointed out it doesnt require much horsepower but the xeon will last longer than the pentiumBut other than that I would go for XorFishs build as as I suspected he knows more about NAS servers than I do.

4049138,0,t1_crh6xd0,Sorry for the delay and this is going to be a response to both posts.In most senarios the X is better at K than the  and comes close to matching the . There are some exceptions and that is for games that are optimized for nvidia such as Witcher  and theres even rumors that its deliberately unoptimized for AMD. At p the GTX  beats the R X by a good amount shown here but scroll down and look at the K gaming benchmarks. Then its gt  X gt . That said Witcher  is not good for K gaming at all even SLI s get fps.As for the CPU like I said theres a  difference between your generation ivy bridge cpu and haswell. And even the difference between an i and an i doesnt make a difference in a lot of games. Once again rare exceptions but overall its not worth the money to upgrade.Now heres the tough part what to get now? That I think should depend on when you want to get into K if you not going to get into K gaming for  months then do not buy a GPU with K in mind as new hardware releases will come out that have better performanceprice for K gaming. For the time being Id just get a  to hold you over. Im recommending the  due to witcher s preference of nvidia cards.If you want to get into K gaming very soon then its a toss up really. Currently you can not max out witcher  at K even with SLI s which is  in GPU. And in most other games x  two X gt SLI  gt  single . So it would really be up to what games you want to play and what settings you would find acceptable.,buildapcforme,crhtzy4,2,t5_2tjcr

I also already have peripherals.Here is what I currently have i CPU  .GHz Gigabyte HMAUSBB motherboard GB of DDR RAM GeForce GTX  Fractal Core  case gb Samsung SSD gb HDDNot sure if any of this can be reused. Obviously the SSD can but everything else Ill probably just sell if I dont use.If you could spare some time to help me build something amazing that would be fantastic. Ive built a couple PCs before. Also feel free to suggest more expensive alternatives to certain aspects if you think they are absolutely worth the money and I will consider investing a bit more but Im looking for the most bang for my buck really.Thanks in advance!,buildapcforme,cs5foa0,1,t5_2tjcr
4258988,0,t3_39r4bs,A lot of people have the misconception that all you need is a big fast video card and monster CPU for Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects and video editing in general but what they leave out and most people dont know this is a large quantity of fast storage drives to move the MASSIVE amounts of data when you are video editing. Its all about having a fast and smooth data stream. You need a well balanced computer.I will explain how the storage drives should be setup for Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects just love to use multiple storage drives at the same time. It increases the performance of video editing tremendously. You will create two TB RAID  arrays using the TB hard drives. Dont worry its easy and only takes about  minutes to do. When you create a RAID  array using two TB hard drives the computer will see them as one TB drive. The capacity not only doubles but also the readwrite speeds going from MBs to MBs.This is how you will setup and use these drives in the computerGB SSD  You will reuse the SSD from your existing computer for this drive. You will install your OS and frequently used programs on this drive.GB SSD  You will use this for Media Cache and as a Scratch disk but otherwise keep it empty.TB HDD RAID  You will use this for your current projects Media Files and Project Files but otherwise keep it empty.TB HDD RAID  You will use this for your current projects Preview Files and Export Files but otherwise keep it empty.TB Standard HDD  You will use this drive for long term data storage. It is not wise to store data long term on a RAID array because of a slightly increased chance of data loss.When you have the drives setup this way this is how the computer will operate during video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro and After EffectsThe program located on SSD will read files from RAID and use the CPU RAM GPU and SSD to work on the files and then send the final results to RAID. This makes for a smooth and fast data stream. You are using  storage drives simultaneously but better yet each drive is either reading or writing but not really both. You will start with your data files on RAID and after editing they will be located on RAID.Now about the CPU...The CPU has  cores and  threads. This is a great CPU for all the multitasking that is involved with video editing.I have GB of RAM in this build but it could use as much RAM as you can stuff inside of it. You can easily upgrade this at a later date if needed. Dont worry the GTX  is plenty fast enough for the rest of this build. I put everything inside an award winning Fractal Design case that is specifically designed for silent operation.Oh...Before I forget...This will be an awesome gaming computer! You will be able to run any current game on max settings.And yes...You will want to overclock this CPU a bit. Dont worry its easy!Take a look at the build and let me know what you think. Im here if you have questions.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core iK .GHz Core Processor | .  Aria PC CPU Cooler | Noctua NHUS . CFM CPU Cooler | .

It really is very easy these days. I highly suggest to run  minutes stress tests in between changing to a higher frequency. After you hit crashes and artifacts.

Crafting means the player finds two or more items and crafts it into a more useful object. Skyrim and Fallout are considered role playing games though they are simulation games as well.My rhetoric is RPGsim games do not have to be about combat. It could have a quite ordinary theme.

Get what uRainday suggested it costs less but also has less performance which might hurt your enjoyment of ARK.. Dont buy anything yet at all. Instead put that money aside and save some more over the next few months so you can get a PC that does what you want.Edit I understand if none of these ideas are appealing to you. Trust me I get that. You want something you want it do to what you want without costing too much and you want it now. Im in the same boat want a decent gaming PC dont have the money so Im saving.

This case in particular can only handle GPUs up to mm in length so keep that in mind.Otherwise yes thats an easy upgrade and that extra  pounds could put this guy in there which fits nicely and offers plenty of performance enough to play the majority of games.

Also are you from Germany because some almost half of the stuff cannot be delivered to Bulgaria.Also what do you think about this build it was suggested to me couple of days ago.Its really under the budget no OS but the psu looks better its more ram and I think I can still use the one I have.

I will link my standard list of helpful videos again for you in case you did not find them. They will explain a lot of commonly asked questions. I also post my guides to help you build the PC.  I will also quickly explain a few of the part choices and where you could consider to cut it down a bit to reduce the cost if needed. I have to post this in a reply since I go over the . character limitation that reddit provides per post. I also did not use PCPartPicker since they dont have a list for Austria. Instead I used a website called www.geizhals.at its little complicated when you first get to this website. But you can create wishlists as well.  Click for the Geizhals wishlist I also made a copy of the list in PPP to make it easy to display. Of course ignore the US prices.

How to build a PC Here Completely ignore the parts that he chose. I actually was very surprised at that date when he came with those products as I dont think its optimized well and the GPU couldve been a lot better. Anyway ignore it! Building a PC is basicly the same the wires did not change and the process is not changed either. You can skip the stock intel CPU cooler part and instantly install the aftermarket CPU cooler. This is just easier for you so you dont have to clean the thermal paste later. Which would cost you another  or so.  How to overclock your GPU Hey guys this is Austin! It really is very easy these days. I highly suggest to run  minutes stress tests in between changing to a higher frequency. After you hit crashes and artifacts. I suggest to go down  steps or at least MHz on the core clock and MHz on the memory. Then do a full  hour stress test at least.  How to install Windows from an USB drive Here is a relative old video. This shows you how you had to install Windows . Windows  are even easier now. You only need to download the create media tool bit from the Windows site. Then you need a GB USB flash drive and plug it into the PClaptop. Run the program and follow the simple steps to make the USB bootable. Once youve done that you can build the PC and follow the steps that they show in the video pretty much.   How to set up your SSD amp HDD Here This video is a little old but it works pretty much the same in Win . He does talk about a few things that arent very important but its good to know. How to use Ninite This video explains it very well as well as their recommendations. For security I advise to only get Avast if you dont mind to get an add every day if you do mind this Windows Defender automatically active on Win is a solid AV as well! amp Malwarebytes.My rationale for the chosen products CPU Intel quadcore locked CPU. Clocked at GHz with a turbo boost up to GHz. Its still a very good CPU for gaming. Clock speeds dont affect the FPS very much in most games. Check out the videos at the top to understand why this CPU will work very well for your use. CPU Cooler You get a stock intel CPU cooler that is very easy to install. It comes with thermal paste preapplied. So you only have to take of the plastic cover and push it in. The reason why I have to suggest the stock cooler over an aftermarket one is because I had no budget left. The stock cooler will keep the temperatures fine. But it can become pretty loud. A simple way to fix this is in the EUFI you can change the fan profile a bit there to make it less aggressive.  Motherboard Great motherboard for the price.  USB x USB . at the rear with front USB . available as well. The CPU is compatible.  Memory RAM is RAM. Speed does not matter at all the only thing that does matter is capacity. For gaming GB is enough as of right now. So I went for a xGB MHz CL kit from Crucial. They buy very good RAM made by Micron. You can upgrade to GB later when you need more RAM. Just buy the same stick if possible and place it. Very easy.   Storage I decided to not get an SSD but spend the money on a better GPU. If you want an SSD check out the video SSD vs HDD to understand the benefits of an SSD than we have to get a worse GPU. This TB HDD is a standard one and will work very well.  Video Card Now this is the beast of the system. Its an awesome card for the price and performs very well. Here is a solid quick review of this card. Now one quick mention. The card actually does not have the full GB of VRAM being usable. Only GB of VRAM can be used at its highest speed. This is important for very high resolution gaming but for p and to an extent p this wont matter much. Here is a video that explains this.  Case Decided to go for a silence optimized case. Its a relatively small case and its okay to work in considering the price. It is not very easy and you have to spend a bit of time to get the cables nice and clean but its possible for sure. Here is a solid review. Placing the MATX motherboard is very tight but doable for sure. Just be a bit careful!  Case fans You only get  mm stock fan which is not a lot. But because the system is low powered and thus also does not produce a lot of heat this will work fine. Your heat exhaust will be done mostly by your PSU and as well by the openings on the back where hot air will escape a bit.  Power Supply  year warranty  bronze nonmodular PSU from SuperFlower. This PSU is very good for its price and I highly recommend to spend enough money on your PSU. Here is a review. Hope you like it and If you have any questions dont hesitate to ask. ,buildapcforme,curfx9n,2,t5_2tjcr

There are only a couple of them and the pricing on them is generally pretty different. In terms of performance for most games its relatively the same.

5149108,0,t1_cv6n7ax, is definitely enough I think for p.  MOBA and MMORPG games are generally pretty light in terms of graphics.  Its the single player games or competitive games where people want to push FPS that require the more powerful GPUs.  Ill take a look at those monitors but Im not sure if Ill have time tonighttomorrow.  What youll want is  p IPS and Hz.  I dont recommend going above  for p because text and such while browsing will look blurry at least they do to me some people dont mind  p.  You want IPS because itll give you better color reproduction compared to TN and less trailing of images compared to VA these are panel display types.  And youll want Hz because itll make your games and such look smoother and is pretty much the standard and minimum to aim for generally speaking when it comes to gaming.Theres not a big difference between the two.  According to this link you get slightly more performance per dollar at the cost of slightly lower overall performance which totally makes sense and is the point of the  haha.  In real world performance I dont think youll notice any differences since the improvements are rather small.,buildapcforme,cv6ntib,1,t5_2tjcr

How to build a PC Here Completely ignore the parts that he chose. I actually was very surprised at that date when he came with those products as I dont think its optimized well and the GPU couldve been a lot better. Anyway ignore it! Building a PC is basically the same the wires did not change and the process is not changed either. You can skip the stock intel CPU cooler part and instantly install the aftermarket CPU cooler. This is just easier for you so you dont have to clean the thermal paste later. Which would cost you another  or so.  How to overclock your GPU Hey guys this is Austin! It really is very easy these days. I highly suggest to run  minutes stress tests in between changing to a higher frequency. After you hit crashes and artifacts. I suggest to go down  steps or at least MHz on the core clock and MHz on the memory. Then do a full  hour stress test at least.  How to install Windows from an USB drive Here is an older video but it works pretty much the same. Its actually easier now. You have to download media creation tool bit for your OS and run that program with a GB USB flash drive plugged into a PC. Then follow the simple steps and the program will make the USB drive bootable. After that all you have to do is build the PC and boot from that USB drive to install Windows.  How to set up your SSD amp HDD Here This video is an other older video but it works pretty much the same in Win . He does talk about a few things that arent very important but its good to know. How to use Ninite This video explains it very well as well as their recommendations. For security I advise to only get Avast if you dont mind to get an add every day if you do mind  just use Microsoft Defender amp Malwarebytes.Hope you like it and If you have any questions dont hesitate to ask. ,buildapcforme,cv79jee,3,t5_2tjcr
5155959,0,t3_3lmf1h,Couple questions    Do you think you would ever be interested in doing any overclocking at any point?    I can understand the hesitancy of not wanting to right away when you dont know anything about how to do it but if you think that theres any chance that you would I would be suggesting different motherboards to you. The reason being that Windows s registration key gets locked to your motherboard so deciding later that you would want to without the proper motherboard to do so could be quite the pain.Im trying to double check but I believe all of those play well with OpenCL right? Its been a long time since Ive used any of those that Im not the most up to date with them but I believe that they all can utilize it well.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Xeon E V .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

Also for most games I played the NVidia cards performed better so I have a pair of GTXs that are overclocked and still remain virtually inaudible. Unfortunately the performance gained by AMD tends to be by giving the cards large memory buses amounts of memory and power then clocking the card high which unfortunately creates a lot of heat. If you plan on having this build anywhere near your desk I would opt for NVidia but that may seem a little biased coming from me. ,buildapcforme,cv90lvj,1,t5_2tjcr

5580278,0,t1_cwool6m,Hopefully my last question for you helpful guys.  Since I am in the middle of a school year I will have to hold off on selling my laptop until after I get my desktop set up so I will stick with an older monitor and keyboard until I get the cash.  Can I go with the  build and then upgrade to the  build when I am ready or will I have to buy certain pieces ahead of time so they work together.  I know there are compatibility issues but these are all above my knowledge.  I do not mind stretching the  dollar budget since I know I will have money on the way but I want to make sure I dont waste money by going cheap simply because I dont have the money in hand at the moment.  ,buildapcforme,cwosa63,1,t5_2tjcr
5586312,0,t1_cwpigc3,The Oculus rift will have a resolution of  or x for each eye. It also has a refresh rate of hz. This means you should get pretty good performance out of the ti and might need to tone down the graphics a little with some new games to keep fps at that resolutions. It is important to keep minimum frame rates above fps or some people will experience motion sickness and it could break immersion somewhat. I have also read a few very cool articles about eye tracking rendering for VR. This tracks where your eyes are looking and renders that area at a very high detail while everything at your peripherals will be at a lower quality. Cool stuff but havent followed it in a little while.If you will notice I left room to go SLI. If you also plan to overclock with SLI I would suggest a w over the w that is in there now.You may also want to get GB of RAM there is room to upgrade later when you want.,buildapcforme,cwpj8kz,2,t5_2tjcr

5667973,0,t3_3sq83a,This is significantly more expensive and a bit over budget. It has a tier  PSU compared to a tier  PSU in yours a slightly faster SSD cheaper and newer case that is similar to yours better GPU that will be much better at p while the R  will likely struggle to get fps on high graphics. Also has more RAM that has lower latency and a less over powered CPU cooler. If you want to do lots of overclocking Id get a Noctua NHD rather than that one.

5775950,0,t1_cxc3wua,Ok to break down your build that you just linked me. I actually need to have the same answers that we ask everyone to be able to see what you want. But I will try to answer this myself as what would probably the most logical reason.   CPU You select the K. The K versions of intel CPUs are unlocked meaning you can overclock it. This requires a motherboard that allows for it as well as a better CPU cooler to deal with the increased heat. So I dont recommend it when youre on a budget. The i is indeed a great CPU for the price. It actually saves more than  but !  Motherboard You dont have to go for a B but can consider even the H chipset. This gives a few less features for storage and USB but I found a great motherboard that got  USB . ports  front USB . as well. It only got  SATA connections and  SATA. So  total storage devices. Connect the HDD to a SATA port since it wont reach the speeds that SATA offers. Use the SATA ports for SSDs.  RAM RAM is RAM it does not matter as you can see in my list above!  Storage To reduce costs I did not include an SSD. But I actually would recommend it if possible. Its just oh god.. I really have a hard time to use my laptop which got a HDD compared to my blazing fast PC with a nice SSD in it.  Video Card Used the same one since its a great one and the price is good.  Case Much higher quality case with solid cable management options which will help a lot! Much easier to work in and SilverStone manuals are amazing. I have a SilverStone case myself.  PSU Slightly less expensive PSU but still great quality. Its non modular however so you will have a bunch of cables comming out. You have to spend a decent amount of time to get these tidy but should not be a big problem. Its a rather big case.

Moores Law states computing power will double every  months. so anything you buy today will be old news but still very usable in  months.If you want a system buy a basic one minimal ram no GPU and small HDD and add in parts as you go.

6251289,0,t1_cyyelcn,If you have the option to return  cancel the RAM I would personally highly recommend to do so. An ITX motherboard only got  DIMM slots where you can place the RAM in. So by going xGB youre stuck on GB. So when you want to upgrade to GB you need to sell your current RAM and buy a new set.  Performance does not matter at all for  or  sticks. Its mostly a marketing aspect. But the FPS difference is not more than  FPS which is negligible. uretilla paging you so you can keep this in mind for the next time. ,buildapcforme,cz07d2s,1,t5_2tjcr

How to build an Intel x socket PC  This is my personal favorite because it goes in depth but still keeps the video relatively short. It also got great camera work so you are able to follow all the steps very well. I decided to skip the start of the video. The reason being that the video is posted on th of May  he gives the rationale of his selected parts at the start. This is a very long time ago so the parts are very old so no need to hear this out. But building a PC is still pretty much the same. No drastic changes.  There are a lot of different build guides on the internet but I really like this one. Its easy to follow. How to install a x CPU Very simple and easy to follow guide again.  How to install RAM Its very simple these days. For DDR its pretty much the same.  How to install Windows . or  from an USB drive You have to download media creation tool which is located at the bottom of the page blue button. Run that program with a GB USB flash drive plugged into a PC. Then follow the simple steps and the program will make the USB drive bootable. After that all you have to do is build the PC and boot from that USB drive to install Windows.  How to set up your SSD amp HDD This video is another older video but it works pretty much the same in Win . He does talk about a few things that arent very important but its good to know. How to use Ninite This video explains it very well as well as their recommendations. For security I advise to only get Avira if you dont mind to get an add every day if you do mind  just use Microsoft Defender amp Malwarebytes. If you want to pay for an antivirus Webroot!

6664939,0,t1_d08hvkv,Sure sorry I didnt explain my question either. There isnt really a single benchmarking game as different games have vastly different requirements. Something like League of Legends for example is going to run well even on an integrated GPU while something AAA and brand new like Fallout  is going to benefit from a faster processor with more cores as well as a better GPU and even faster RAM according to some reviews. Certain games like DF and Cities Skylines are heavily CPU bound while many other games rely more on the GPU. I always recommend if theres a particular game you plan or application you use to look up benchmarks for that game specifically to know what to expect.Monitors in the Hz ranger are commonly used for fast twitch games like CSGO since the extra speed improves your performance. Thats not to say you cant enjoy beautiful smooth performance in every game but usually the response rate is a trade off versus better color reproduction at Hz.I dont understand why you would want to render  frames if you only have a Hz monitor. Those extra  fps you will quite literally never see so Id suggest that you upgraded your monitor to p for example. I suppose you might want  FPS average so that your  dips wont be below Hz because thats absolutely the lowest frame rate you can tolerate but that seems to be in serious competitive gamer territory.,buildapcforme,d08pnlb,1,t5_2tjcr

In this case changing the CPUs frequency isnt something that benefits you in any measurable let alone noticeable way when gaming. It also costs more since you have to have a more expensive model of CPU and an aftermarket CPU cooler along with a more expensive model of motherboard. However overclocking the GPU is a very good idea as it gives a lot of extra gaming performance if correctly done but costs nothing extra.The monitor you already have is fine unless you want to spend some more on a higher resolution monitor p vs p for example  but playing games at higher qualities takes more horsepower though which is a lot more expensive. At your budget I think p gaming is your best bet and you can in future get a higher resolution monitor and better graphics card.Any questions? Ask away!,buildapcforme,d0gp1qv,1,t5_2tjcr

6928587,0,t1_d11npo4,gt So you say Flash and HTML can use GPUHow much it helps can vary quite a bit. Flash items need to be written for or tagged to support hardware acceleration. In many items this just offloads the drawing and coloring of vectors and sprites to the GPU hardware card or integrated instead of on the CPU in software.The other spot this can be a huge help is with scaling zooming. Scaling the size of an object is something GPUs do very well in hardware. Most browsers these days actually tie into using the GPU with either WebGL or DirectX to improve the page rendering and scaling speeds.And then theres Unity. Full on D accelerated game engine that works on phones Browsers and full PCs.gt  what are the in browser game engines that cannot use GPU?I think pretty much everything has some degree of GPU hardware acceleration capability these days.  The real question is how much does it make a difference. And is there any difference between a stand alone GPU and the integrated GPU in a modern iii.While I dont personally know how much it will help at the extreme end of BTD ...

6963215,0,t1_d15ivdm,Hmm. This build really doesnt seem very well optimised to me.A K is very wasteful considering it performs worse than Haswell last gen is more expensive than said last gen and OP isnt even overclocking. Oh and I forgot none of the games that OP mentioned will be bottlenecked by a lower end CPU eg a  at p.That CPU cooler is also insanely wasteful given that watercooling brings no benefit whatsoever to OP if theyre not overclocking and even if they were it still wouldnt unless they want a space heater. However watercooling has lots of downsides such as that a leak could fry OPs expensive system that its much noisier than an equivalently priced air cooler has an incessant pump whine noise alongside with other stuff.Then here comes the bit I absolutely cant understand. Why did you go for such an expensive CPU and watercooler and then go for a super expensive H motherboard? Makes absolutely no sense. If you are going to waste OPs money on overclockable parts that theyre not even going to overclock you may as well at least give them the proper kit. For that much money you could almost be getting two well priced Haswell Z boards.Then you added insanely overpriced and unnecessarily much RAM. Ive seen RAM go for  new for GB. Theres no need to spend  more just to have a fancy brand label and a heatsink on it. And then the amount of RAM. Which of the games that OP mentioned needs GB RAM? None.As for the SSD its very good I have two myself due to pricing in my country but in the USA its overpriced compared to the competition. An Adata SP performs equally unless youre running unrealistic benchmarks but costs another ish less.Then the graphics card. Its a decent price for a  but at this budget  total you should be getting much much more than a midrange GPU.That case is nice but I think the sacrifices it makes miniITX arent worth the downsides eg not being able to have SLI harder to cool etc.For  less theres the equally good EVGA GQ.For  Amazon sells Windows  Professional. Activates  Pro not Home.And wheres the monitor OP asked for?By comparison for  more about a third I got OP a p IPS  monitor an amazing Ti and SLI compatibility plus a keyboard that you also didnt include.I think you might want to rethink that build significantly.,buildapcforme,d15m6qk,1,t5_2tjcr

You also want great single core performance. High clock speeds on modern Intel cpus are the way to go. Autocad only uses two cores for most workloads. Rendering will benefit from extra cores etc. but for daily work you want fast cores when doing the workflow.I would look at getting a i  or something close to that with a basic motherboard. I run GB of memory at work and its generally sufficient. Id take more cpu horsepower than more memory for most tasks for sure. If youre connecting to network storage most likely the case then there is no reason not to buy a small cheap ssd GB is likely sufficient for all your apps and OS. Just my take on it based on my experience with similar workloads at my job. ,buildapcforme,d1j99u2,1,t5_2tjcr

Of course on the lowest setting but it could get it done. The K is the skylake version of the K. Really there may be a couple FPS difference between the two but both should last and perform well for you. If you are using the iGPU then I may suggesting going with the K as it has better graphics. If you cannot make the difference then the K is by far a great choice as well. If you get the K look for Z boards and for the K get Z boards as they allow for overclocking. The K does not come with a stock cooler and you will need to purchase an aftermarket cooler. The K does come with a stock cooler.

With the  dollars saved plus the  dollars remaining in OPs maximum budget you could put a better video card in both pcs or maybe upgrade the cpu instead. With an extra  between both pcs you could definitely upgrade it a little bit. This is all assuming of course that op would be fine with a smaller ssdlarger hhd combo in exchange for a small upgrade in hardware. Maybe upgrade from the  to the x or the i to the i. Im not sure it would make much of a difference or if it would be actually worth the sacrifice of the  GB ssd plus the extra costs which pushes the budget closer to ops maximum limit but I figured Id just make the suggestion.

7522133,0,t3_4icezs,Just because you have the budget doesnt mean that you have to spend it. First of youre current peripherals. That monitor is going to be a xp. This needs a big upgrade when you spend so much money on a PC. Also.. I see that youre a fan of Razer. I dont care much about the mouse amp keyboard. But the headset.. Yeah you can do soo much better.  The sound quality of the Tiamat is just.. terrible trust me.  I included a very high quality pair of headphones. Its hard to suggest the absolute correct one without knowing your music preference but this pair will work in  of the case.  I also included an extremely high quality but rather large microphone. You can get a much smaller one if you prefer that. Let me know! Ill provide you with my standard list of videos to help you understand why I suggest these products.  I give you a couple of great guides to help you build the PC.  Lastly Ill provide my rationale for each product. Ill also compare it to the  build if I feel the need for it.

GuidesNow before you have a look at all these guides. The best guide in most cases will always be your MANUAL. Some manuals are garbage but most of them are more than good enough to be able to help figure out most problems.  How to build an Intel x socket PC  This is my personal favorite because it goes in depth but still keeps the video relatively short. It also got great camera work so you are able to follow all the steps very well.  I would suggest to install the aftermarket CPU cooler right away then you dont have to clean the thermal paste.  I decided to skip the start of the video. The reason being that the video is posted on th of May  he gives the rationale of his selected parts at the start. This is a very long time ago so the parts are very old so no need to hear this out. But building a PC is still pretty much the same. No drastic changes.  There are a lot of different build guides on the internet but I really like this one. Its easy to follow. How to install a x CPU  Very simple and easy to follow guide again.  How to install thermal compound  The temperature difference between the best and the worst thermal compound is a couple degrees Celsius. The temperature difference between applying thermal compound one way or an other.. is  degrees.  Be careful though! The only way that the temperature will rise is when you dont put enough. So it needs to have enough but too much can cause problems as well. So dont go overkill either!  Thermal compound helps with the contact of the cooler  the CPU. They both have microscopically small gaps which the thermal compound fills up to let the heat get too the heatsink.  How to install Windows . or  from an USB drive  You have to download media creation tool which is located at the bottom of the page blue button. Run that program with a GB USB flash drive plugged into a PC. Then follow the simple steps and the program will make the USB drive bootable. After that all you have to do is build the PC and boot from that USB drive to install Windows.  How to set up your SSD amp HDD  This video is another older video but it works pretty much the same in Win .  How to overclock an Intel  Skylake CPU  Again a simple video and not too long. They used an overpriced Asus motherboard which got different names in the BIOS compared to other brands. So you might have to look around a little bit. But in general theyre named very similar. I would personally start with a .V amp  multiplier. I might have been unlucky with the CPUs that I overclocked but GHz wasnt running at .Vs that often just one so far. How to use Ninite  This video explains it very well as well as their recommendations. For security I advise to only get Avira if you dont mind to get an add every day if you do mind  just use Microsoft Defender amp Malwarebytes. If you want to pay for an antivirus Webroot! Light weight very high detection rate. ,buildapcforme,d2x89z2,1,t5_2tjcr
7522621,0,t1_d2xa6d7,Absolutely I am an idiot. I did not look closely at your request at all. So yes we change the CPU to the i. All the rest is absolutely fine and no need to be changed. Update Not worth it to go for the iK the i is more than good enough. Clock speed does not realy matter from a certain point. So dont worry about this at all it will only provide a couple extra FPS at most in some games. In most games the difference is almost unnoticeable.  You want an i for when you stream games this will help a lot. Because of hyperthreading and the H. codec. You can also use the Nvidia codec to stream games which utilizes the GPU encoder to stream the game this means that the CPU does not need to encode thus not pushing the CPU at all and reducing FPS.  It also only got a very small hit on the GPU in terms of FPS. The only downside of this is that the quality is less high compared to the Intel H. encoder. ,buildapcforme,d2xa9r6,1,t5_2tjcr
7535526,0,t1_d2yqmm8,Cant go much slimmer than this. Plus moving to an ITX motherboard makes onboard wifi cheap. If you need bluetooth in the future you can get a  BT. USB adapter. A w PSU should be enough even for a GTX w though you can go with a w or w system if you think you need to. I added a cooler to the CPU due to the limited airflow and it will also help with noise reduction.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core i .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

On the motherboard do you think it is better to have a separate sound card and minimal integrated graphics considering that I will have a dedicated GPU for three monitors that I will need to use.   Do you think it would be more appropriate to use a basic Z chipset motherboard and get the rest from additional sound cards including a separate controller for Thunderbolt ?,buildapcforme,d38995a,1,t5_2tjcr

Id say you should get a monitor with p if youre getting  down the line but another option would be to go for k  p monitor if you want slightly more powerful CPU with hyperthreading if you use applications that take advantage of it. Build is  excluding the mail in rebates. Building computers havent really changed much. Read all the manuals especially case and mobo manual to know where all the parts go where theyre supposed to. Also read instructions for CPU cooler carefully as they can be the trickiest part to install. Another thing is you should test the components with just mobo  cpucooler   ram and psu with a monitor just to see if it POSTS.

8016757,0,t1_d4h5fm6,CPU core count is more beneficial since the GPU cant help compile the code.I assume what is happening is we are bound by something that hardware threads in a core share cache ? bandwidth ? rather than by how fast we issue instructions so the bottleneck is already mostly saturated with one software thread per core. We do get some speedup going from  thread per core to  but it is like .X or less.,buildapcforme,d4h5p4z,1,t5_2tjcr

8047026,0,t3_4peviy,Careful the GS in the other build wont fit in your case! According to the specs at least. The case actually restricts our PSU options by quite a lot. We dont hit fully modular units that fit until  and there arent any top quality semimodular units that fit until that range either. Since youre looking to keep the price low I think you might go with a CXMNow it sounds like you might know a little about PSUs so youre probably recoiling in horror right now but Corsair actually released three completely new CX units recently  the   and . They use DCDC converters on the secondary side which is a huge step up from the old group regulated design. The most recent CX PSUs before these already had Japanese main caps so the weakness was likely in the secondary caps which are solid polymer now. The fear of CX was already way overblown to begin with IMO and these new ones are looking pretty danged good. Its also worth noting that they have  year warranties vs the older models . As for GPU youll want to wait on the GTX  I think. Kepler xx and xx series was known to suffer performance degradation during Maxwells xx series time. I dont mean to imply anything and in fact Im trying to actively avoid jumping to conclusions but given what weve seen I have to advise against buying older Nvidia GPUs if futureproofing is a concern. Games are starting to use more and more VRAM too. We saw this very recently in Mirrors Edge benchmarks where the s lack of VRAM caused the game to automatically turn down graphics settings during gameplay. And when reviewers turned off this feature the game became unstable at highest settings GB or bust IMO.Unfortunately we dont know when the  is coming out or if it will even have an GB model. At the risk of sounding like a salesgirl I think you should keep an eye on RX  benchmarks! Its coming out next week and the GB model seems to have an MSRP of  USD. If prices turn out to be unfairly high over there note that US vendor BampH offers free shipping to Canada.,buildapcforme,d4kk894,1,t5_2tjcr

It is I found a post on reddit using these two parts and asked the OP if he needed to do any case mods or had difficulty. He did not and had submitted a request to PCPP to remove the warning. The rear PSU chamber can accommodate this radiator. Having a mm radiator for just the CPU will provide plenty of cooling for overclocking. mm is the largest you can get for an all in one water cooler.The Asus workstation ws motherboard is definitely one of the best most reliable motherboards. This is the micro ATX version.The corsair vengeance LPX low profile RAM is very high quality stuff. Ive included  GB worth that is rated to k hz.The  Pro is a very reliable and incredibly fast m SSD drive. M drives mount directly to the motherboard increasing speed dramatically and reducing cable clutter. No cables are required at all.The GTX  is the current flagship card from NVIDIA.This power supply is one of the top rated PSUs for reliability and can supply  watts. Plenty of overhead for overclocking.These fans are quiet and powerful specially designed for radiator cooling. Put  mm on the mm radiator in the rear chamber.  on the top and  on the bottom for pushpull.  mm fans go in the front for intake.  mm fan goes in the exhaust port of the front motherboard chamber.The main draw of this case other than its fantastic good looks huge window and  foot cubed size for portability is its dual chamber design. The rear chamber can accommodate the CPU cooler and PSU cooling just those components while the front can cool your GPU and motherboard without having to deal with the extra heat from the components being cooled in the rear. Its definitely my favorite case. Also if you later want to try a custom loop you can fit a mm rad in the rear and a mm rad in the front. Check out the OCD review of the case on YouTube for more information on the case.Note you might need a PWM fan controller to run all these fans.This one is fine stick it on the rear chamber side of the metal divider the motherboard is mounted to.,buildapcforme,d4o6fau,0,t5_2tjcr

8409153,0,t3_4utanz,Build includes everything except headset. CPU i is more than enough for gaming wont be behind in other tasks as well. Motherboard Solid H board with good price tag. RAM  GB of DDR RAM so you probably wont have to think about upgrading it in like three years. SSD  GB of fast storage youll put OS software and maybe some games here. Games do not get performance boost but theyre loading faster. HDD TB of regular storage. Youll have the rest of data here basically all media and majority of games. GPU Go for either GTX  or RX . The supply is now low so Ive selected basically a placeholder to put up a price in there.  Case Simple elegant quiet and good for cooling. Be aware that Define S is also pretty big and quite heavy. PSU Quality power source fully modular. OS Windows  as you wanted. Keyboard Mechanical I recommend Cherry MX Brown switches. You could pay extra and get something like K witch customizable backlight.  Mouse Great mouse one of those with flawless sensors. G is quite large so if you have small hands you might want to look at alternatives.As for the headset... Dont buy a headset. Get solid headphones and microphone.    This will put you somewhat above the budget though not much.The choice pretty much depends on your needs. You can either get bassy boomy headphones or more serious ones. Youll also have to pick between open and closed design. Open design has better sound but others in the room can hear what youre listening to and you can hear outside noises. Closed ones isolate better but are also worse for longer sessions they dont breathe.    Im also gonna assume that you dont have an amplifier so youll need headphones that arent hard to drive.Id probably opt for Audio Technica ATHAD series. X and X now run at around . Theyre open they do not have heavy bass and they have great sound all around.As far as microphone goes you could get Antlion ModMic  which essentially turns the headphones into a headset you attach them to the headphones but you have to run both wires down.   An alternative would be to get desktop microphone which would run anywhere from  for some good USB microphones to  for Blue Yeti.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core i .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

8478670,0,t3_4vqkyx,Here you go! This is my general suggestion. Pick up the CPU and motherboard at Microcenter for a combo deal.  I stuck with xGB kit of RAM then you can always upgrade to GB if you truly have a need for it. I got the GB  EVO because GB is a pretty good size for an OS and active projects while the TB is for storing finishedinactive projectsbulk media. But you could ditch them and get a GB  EVO for about . The i should perform very well for your needs and I dont see any need for anything beefier. The graphics card was tough. I was thinking about getting a GeForce but I think that the K should be able to beat out any GeForce cards around that price point.

8739081,0,t1_d6xztwn,Yeah I would get a monitor if I could aford it. For some games its fine racing or rd person like GTA for instance. But for some other games strategy etc or even web browsing TV is less than ideal.The cheaper one does not support SLI putting multiple graphic cards at the same time to gain performance. If you get the more expensive one you can  down the road put another of the same graphics card say a used one you find for cheap and gain up to twice the performance.

In a few years you might want to add a second gb stick.Storage A small SSD for Windows and your Adobe programs including catalogs and a large HDD for your games as well as anything you make in CCCS.

I also think its little fans are adorable but Im weird. You can expect to play modern games on high p at fps or more if you drop the quality down.

9606428,0,t3_5ch9xx,Ok here are my suggestions based on the prices of Amazon Mexico.CPUThe i and the Pentium G are both decent choices for your daughter. Al though the i is more powerful the Pentium will still run lowend games decently if you dont wish for groundbreaking performance. The i is probably overkill. Alsom you probably dont need a CPU cooler.MotherboardDoesnt look too expensive but will serve its job. If you can find a cheaper one you can go for it instead.RAMLooks like the cheapest GB stick of DDR RAM if you find cheaper from renowned company sticks go for them.StorageYou may want to either go for a TB HDD GB SSD TB HDD or a GB SSD. I do not think that GB SSD is going to be large enough for your daughter as she will need to store Windows games software and documents in it.GPUThe RX  is your best choice. This one is a GB version but it will run the likes of Dota well.Power SupplyThat power supply is actually decent but this one is a better option and doesnt look too expensive.CaseI like this Corsair one but you may want a cheaper case. I havent found great cases cheaper than this one myself.PeripheralsMonitorThat monitor is good. The peripherals are your choice since thats personal preference. The monitor should come with a DVI cable if Im not mistaken.,buildapcforme,d9x6t62,3,t5_2tjcr

9778041,0,t1_daiah35,A Freesync monitor will make sure your monitor refreshes the screen evenly if the number of frames output by the graphics card doesnt exactly line up with the refresh rate of the monitor. The h and b are chipsets so there will be multiple motherboards to choose from. The only limitation youll see is that you wont be able to overclock and there is no impact on upgrades for the vast majority of gamers.AMD is the other main graphics card manufacturer and they are definitely reliable. In fact they tend to have better driver support for their GPUs in the long run and a card like an rx  is definitely competitive at its price point. I should mention that Freesync only works with AMD cards  the equivalent on the Nvidia side is Gsync which often costs significantly more than a comparable freesync enabled monitor.,buildapcforme,daicxnh,2,t5_2tjcr

9789706,0,t3_5f91f2,Oh boy you seem to be slightly misinformed or perhaps read some wrong information.  Lets clear up a few things first. gt mITX mobo LGA socket as far as I know only Asrock makes a mITX in lga and that and the corresponding CPU is out of the price range.  Thats certainly not out of your budget range if you dont go too crazy on other parts. Its of course not cheap but possible for sure.  gt CPU I actually have no problem waiting until Kaby Lake or Zen processors come out.  Then I would highly recommend to do so Zen actually seems to be very awesome from the few leaks that are around. But we have to wait and see if it is all true. I certainly hope so! gt Powersupply I would like to futureproof this part as much as possible and in  platinum or titanium and fully modular. The  rating is only the efficiency of the PSU. It does not actually indicate quality. But most  platinium or titanium PSU are pretty high quality. But you can certainly find some exrtemely high quality  golds.  Its even possible to find  bronze units that are higher quality compared to some  golds units.   So you can certainly buy an EVGA G or Corsair RMx  gold unit. They both offer  year warranty which is probably what youre after.  gt CPU Cooler An All In One Liquid Cooler is a must mainly for looks. Room for mm and mm radiators. One model that I have looked at is the Swiftech HX Prestige. I am interested in hearing your thoughts on that.  This depends a lot on your final destination with the custom water cooling loop. Do you want a CPU amp GPU waterblock loop  If so I am not sure if the Swiftech block would work since the reservoir is mounted on the radiator. It likely would fit but I just am not sure about the dimensions. Might be a bit tight.  I am not sure how expensive that Swiftech product is but the start kit from EK can be had for gt A TB harddrive would be great if it exists in the . form factor at  rpm even better. In a . form factor you dont have the  RPM HDDs. That are worth the money.. The only big HDD is a TB RPMgt I want my boot times to be AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. With that said Ive looked at the Samsung  pro. M. or U. is a must as I dont have any left over PCIe slots and SATA III is too slow. SATA too slow? I mean for booting up the PC.. the difference between an NVMe amp SATA SSD is a couple of seconds at most. I can time it but I have the Samsung  EVO and its roughly  seconds to restart my PC.  An NVMe drive would only see real benefit when you heavily edit videos and push large files to and from it. I mean when you spend over th of your  budget just one an SSD.. it better be worth it!  In other words you would sacrifice the  core  threaded beasts of CPUs that would be available if you dont get the  PRO. gt I am currently using dual p screens. I will be upgrading to  or maybe even  k screens in the future along with a major graphics card increase.   If somebody could recommend me a k screen in the smallest possible form factor Im used to  inch  ratio that would be awesome . This will not be included in the overall budget. You do not want to go small size for K resolution displays. You simply do not want to do this. Remember everything will be  times as small compared to p on a K display. So if you have a K monitor.. you really dont want to go lower than  preferably  actually.  The stuff on the screen becomes just so small that you have to use windows up scaling which is really not great.  You should rather look at the xp ultrawides and perhaps a  p monitor. Hopefully this answered some of your questions but feel to ask anything that may spike your interest or where you want more clarification! ,buildapcforme,dajsles,2,t5_2tjcr

Battlefield one supports it but doesnt increase performance using it and thats just a fairly rare occasion of when a game does support it. Dx  games tend not to. Even though fps numbers go up in sli inconsistently being  to  better than a single card frame timings become inconsistent and it looks the same or worse.My advice would be since you are spending this much get the basics right like a nice case power supply monitor fking check and case fans. Stuff that wont really become obsolete so any saved budget can be used for the next gen of nvidia or amd cards in like  years or whatever when youll have a rock solid system to put them into.

10265110,0,t1_dc7alng,So the only reason you should get a K processor is to overclock your system. To overclock you would need a z or z board. Since this is a th generation processor I would go for a z board. The best board for the money would probably be the Asus zE. It has all the qualities you would ever need in a motherboard and overclocking potential but it also costs a bit less than most other z motherboards. The CPU cooler above should do fine for a k so all you would need is a new motherboard and maybe a little stronger PSU but w looks fine to me.,buildapcforme,dc7ltxi,1,t5_2tjcr

10408742,0,t1_dcnw0sa,I know that I probably have a more selective taste for quality than what the  year old brother may have but that looks terrible. Is that on the absolute lowest settings and only getting fps probably lower since the G has HD  iGPU? Its definitely seems playable though I have to give it that.Going with the RX  if OP is able to will greatly improve the gaming quality of the build or even going with a used GPU which is what the intended use is. It would help if OP can score an H mobo that has an updated BIOS and then the total cost will be somewhere around . ,buildapcforme,dcnwd2m,1,t5_2tjcr
10408976,0,t1_dcnst3g,I would just go skylake if I were you. You really dont need hyperthreading or  cores for the games you listed so buy the last gen skylake g. Then you also dont have to worry about ending up with a motherboard that hasnt been updated already and wont post. Id also recommend a dedicated GPU. Rocket league will run but it might have some pretty low drops in FPS and if there are other games your bro might try out he has a little more headroom with an RX . Itll put you over budget at about . If you have to buy the OS then  but you can use the trial version by downloading it and skipping the activation key prompt or look around for ways to get it cheaper.

10954865,0,t3_5wgtuj,Honestly. Hz gaming is great to get you ahead of the curve in some games but majority of the time its not really going to be a make it or break it for most titles. Running The Witcher  in Hz sounds great on paper but in practicefor me personally in your joe average photo realistic fun game the difference isnt really worth the higher investment get hardware that can actually run that kind of FPS. And IMO if youre purely gaming an unlocked i like the ik and the ik is more than you will ever need. The Ryzen  series CPUs look great performance wise but honestly you arent getting your moneys worth with these Core CPUs unless youre heavily into streaming or some sort of CPU heavy work like videoediting or AUTOCAD. People have been saying shit like Oh games are going to be using more cores year after year. And guess what. Were still waiting. People seem to have the misconception these days that a strong quad core CPU like an unlocked i arent powerful enough to carry you through the coming years for gaming. FutureProofing is often an ill used term by most plebs. Literally run if you see someone making a build like that because they probably have no idea what theyre talking about. Futureproofing doesnt exist because technology is always moving forward. Theres no set guidelines to follow or guaranteed way to keep your components competitive enough with the bleeding edge through the years. Its just not going to happen.TLDR If you can wait for the Ryzen  Series CPUs then get that instead and honestly Hz isnt all that is cracked up to be unless youre using it for competitive games. But its really your call. I wouldnt loose sleep over not having hz more than I wouldnt loose sleep over not having p.,buildapcforme,de9x00a,11,t5_2tjcr

And all the smaller studios have used geforce cards.So before you start being pedantic and talking down on people maybe even do some of your own research. If you google and READ the updates on autocad you will see a lovely little bit that says thisgtAdds support for Nvidia Geforce graphics card driver version . for XP XP Vista Vista  Win Win  operating systemsSo not only DOES autocad support the geforce but its BETTER to get these cards for consumer level due to the increased ram increased speed and better updates to drivers and the added benefit of gaming.Just my  cents.,buildapcforme,dez9bnq,3,t5_2tjcr

11782000,0,t3_683i94,A Ryzen based system with everything included coming in under budgetRyzen  is a good value in multithreaded applications itll perform on par with an i which is nearly double the cost for the CPU not to mention this CPU can overclock for better performance out of the box and can get even better with a more adequate cooler than the stock cooler though the stock cooler will do just fine to get you up and running. The motherboard is a good one especially for the price.The RAM speed actually matters with Ryzen where it doesnt with Intel so the extra  bucks for faster RAM will increase performance.A GB SSD for the OS and games you really care about. Youll notice a difference in boot times and I think if you have to choose between SSD or HDD its better to go SSD first. Migrating an operating system is not as easy as installing a secondary drive.An RX . This card is VR capable will do p maxed out and p with some compromises as well. Yeah its a refreshed Rx  bUT faster clock speeds help it out.An HDD for additional storage. A PSU FROM EVGA.  Gold and fully modular which is nice for first time builders.A case from Fractal Design with a window and PSU shroud. Super nice for first time builders. A hz monitor. A retail copy of Windows  with bootable ISO USB. Saves you headaches and if you have to change motherboards for any reason its easier to change the key over than it is with an OEM key.A keyboardand mouse bundle from Cooler Master. Itll get you up and running not the best in terms of peripherals but good for starting. Now if you can use a TV for a little bit you can put the extra money saved into getting more GPU and CPU powerI used a TV for the first year of my PC. It worked just fine for the games I played.

When you will be getting used to pc gaming you can upgrade it but dont have to if you arent getting any problems. This here  is a good choice for a watercooler. Motherboard The motherboard is a good choice for the K it has a lot of features so that when you want to upgrade something you only have to put it in. Memory GB are enough for the start in the future you can upgrade to GB but you have to use the same  RAM sticks. Storage The SSD from Samsung is currently the best GB . SSD on the market. It has the most advanced technology and you can put your OS and most of your games on it. Documents like an important paper you can put on the HDD. The HDD will I promise NEVER run full so you dont have to buy a new one in the next few years. GPU The  Ti is the fastest GPU for gaming money can buy and the Asus Strix version of the  Ti is the fastest one. It is a really good gaming GPU and will play games at least on Ultra with p in  years. Current titles can be played with up to Kfps and Ultra settings with no problems. Case I dont have much to say about the case. It looks really cool and is the perfect case for your demands. Power Supply This power supply has an  Titanium rating so its one of the best and W are enough for the CPU the GPU cooler SSD and HDD. OS Windows  I dont have much to say about that..
