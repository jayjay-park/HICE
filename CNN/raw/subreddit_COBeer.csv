3341443,0,t1_cp8gkug,Ive seen it done all ways. Most here in Denver and Colorado in general will give you a sample if you ask. I do know of a couple that in the past have required to buy a full taster which doesnt really both me at all. I also feel bad asking for more than two tasters just cause I feel like Im wasting timeenergy or something. And if its crowded it might be  minutes before I actually get a beer if I opt to ask for a sample by the time they get back to me.,COBeer,cp95dqm,1,t5_2ti3a

6856264,0,t3_49k2hg,Just a note if anyone cares Grub Hub and similar rd party delivery organizations fuck over the takeout person at the restaurant. Takeout will handle and assemble the order then the GH person delivers it and gets the tip meaning the takeout person did half the work for none of the money. Takeout makes the same sub minimum wage that waitstaff does.Not trying to demonize GH or their employees just wanted to throw it out there that the employee at the restaurant gets a raw deal from this business model.,COBeer,d0tgs9g,1,t5_2ti3a

Bummer I know.I get a regular trash bag put a pack in the bottom and tie it off as close to the er as I can then fold the rest of the bag around and use the draw strings to pull it shut and tie it off a second time. Like double bagging with a single bag. The liquid would have to travel a loooong way to get out unless punctured. Then i surround it with clothes putting it in the middle of the suitcase. I had a can develop a pinhole leak my first time flying with beer soaked the gfs suitcase which she said she would kill me if beer leaked so I had to spend  days cleaning drying seeing a stain and cleaning more and so on.,COBeer,ddw68uk,1,t5_2ti3a
