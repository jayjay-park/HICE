206832,0,t1_cf1zkn6,Youre probably right. Then again I saw this over on Wikigt Starting with episode  the show changed drastically focusing on the characters and discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for a narrative focusing on the individual characters. This change coincided with Annos development of an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness. This focus culminated in a psychoanalysis of the characters in the two final episodes. The production ran so close to the airing deadline that the completed scenes used in the preview of the twenty fifth episode had to be redesigned to work with the new ending. These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation flashbacks simple line drawings photographs and fixed image scenes with voiceover dialogue. Some critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts but Toshio Okada stated that they were the result of the ending being decided only three months before airing.,evangelion,cf202jh,2,t5_2r6ex

213535,0,t1_cf2lj33,Also very good points! I think more than anything here Im trying to shrug off that popular theory you and I dislike.Some other reasons I tend to connect the two sequences is because in both scenesShinji shows aggression kicking and choking forcefullyShinji doesnt go all the way through with his aggression because of either some realization i.e. depends on NERV or acknowledging affection i.e. as you said Asukas affectionToddler Shinji begins to cry after realizing what he has done and tries to fix it in a similar sense Shinji cries and lets go after realizing Asukas affection.Keep in mind Im still trying to angle this connection correctly with what my friend managed to say and its rather rough around the edges no doubt. Unnecessary? Perhaps. However it felt interesting knowing perhaps one could connect that sand pyramid sequence to the ending scene.

Asuka assimilated into the th Angel in . and Shinji assimilated into EVA at the end. If Asuka was a lilin why wouldnt she just say Lets go see if anyone can pick us up why did she specify lilin!?

Perhaps the entirety of the Rei Clone series was created at that young age of  or so and simply grew like normal throughout the years. Gendo didnt want a full on clone of Yui walking around.

392489,0,t3_1ykfid,I think youre hitting it right on the nail when you draw the connection between Shinji and the tape player. In fact this rather recent article should be right up your alley.If I read your interpretation earlier than that article it would had definitely gave me an Aha! moment about . too. So in general I dont view . as negatively as before. gtalso the characters actually have development unlike the original seriesThis part I would have to disagree with. I would hate to diverge into NGE vs Rebuild yada yada debate but since its in your OP post mind explaining this? I will come to common ground with you and say Reis character growth was easier to notice in the Rebuilds while the series it was rather subtle and is almost considered to be an outoftheblue moment when she rejects Gendo in End of Evangelion. In respect to Shinji which I assume you would most likely disagree on I would venture to say Shinji does have major character development due to his ultimate decision in End of Evangelion.Its usually popular to say Shinji started out as a whiny character and ended as a whiny character which to me is shallow. If you look at the TV series end surely the Congratulations counts as a strong indicator that Shinji realized all that paindespair meant something and only he had the power to change his outlook on life. In EoE he rejects Human Instrumentality which is also similar to him coming to a realization from the TV series ending. I suppose one could say But in One More Final he tries to kill Asuka and goes back to crying! He never develops! and while we could all bring out our favorite interpretation of the EoE ending one thing certain is that Shinji at least has the experience from over the period of time he had during the series unlike Episode s Shinji. I will also say yes of course it is easier to notice Shinjis character growth in the Rebuilds but I also defend that NGEEoEs Shinji had been doing so as well in a realistic and gradual method. However Im just assuming youre part of the crowd that thinks otherwise of NGEs Shinji. Apologizes for diverging on this as for the most part I agree with your points about .s Shinji.,evangelion,cflg4cn,6,t5_2r6ex

It is this connection that makes piloting possible.Rei is able to pilot Unit because she possess the soul of Lilith and  Unit is the only Evangelion to be made of Lilith rather then Adam. In short the soul fits with the body.And of course Kaworu is able to pilot because he possesses the soul of Adam while inside the synthetic manifestation of Adams body.It would appear from this that its not necessarily age that decides who the pilot is but rather how that pilot is connected to the unit.Edit See ohmans correction on Unit coming from Lilith rather then Unit.,evangelion,ci1x1ys,4,t5_2r6ex

1859245,0,t1_ckd3gpc,I agree with nearly everything you said... One thing though. I dont think the lances summoning was spontaneous at all. There is a lance included with every egg. The lances are supposed to be a failsafe in case two eggs and egg of life holding Adam and an egg of wisdom holding Lilith land on the same planet like they did on Earth. During second impact the lance is what stopped Adam from awakening fully because Liliths life had already flourished. The lances are supposed to fly out at anything causing an impact and end it. Thats what theyre made to do. But when its Liliths own lance being called the result is different.TLDR Lances are supposed to fly across the planet and stop impacts because theyre failsafes against such things thats what happened in EoE except Lilith called her own lance to a lilim having a different effect than just an impact.,evangelion,ckd8fjj,6,t5_2r6ex

2614205,0,t1_cmzt4xs,yeah i read the previous comments. I agree with you it is kind of a stereotypical episode but that doesnt mean its bad.  NGE IS an anime after all. I think the introduction of Asuka has a lot to do with it as well.  They switched the mood of the show up for a little bit to kind of mirror her personality a bit at least the exterior.  in any case personally even though its a bit stereotypical its well done establishes character development and fits in decently with a few of the other episodes.

3100310,0,t3_2vn9tp,Original NGE hands down. It really isnt even close with this one.NGE is a masterpiece. The overarching themes and motifs in NGE are conveyed masterfully and in a way that simply couldnt have been done in any other medium or time period. The character interactions are believable and powerful. The characters themselves are fully realized. Now this isnt to say that NGE is without flaws. The plot is confusing somewhat poorly conveyed along with being fairly pointless most of the time. Gainax had some huge budget issues Though I think that the choices made due to said budget issues were genius. But when all is said and done the good of NGE vastly vastly outweighs the bad. Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most influential and culturally relevant works in all of anime and there is a very very good reason why many people say it is the best of all time.The Rebuilds arent bad. Hell with the exception of . they are quite good. The first is a rehash but its well executed enough and I will be the first to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed . from its weird haremy love interest side plot to its Gurren Lagann ending. I thought . was a train wreck but that is another issue entirely. The bottom line is that there are a number of reasons to like the Rebuilds. They are utterly gorgeous from a visual perspective and all three movies have spectacular soundtracks. Hell even the character interactions and story are pretty good compared to what most of modern media is spewing out nowadays. However its just less than what NGE was. The characters are far more cliche than their original incarnations. Many important side characters are essentially nonexistent. Theres weird new pointless characters thrown in for no apparent reason cough Mari cough cough. Even the plot falls into typical anime cliche from time to time. Now some of this is simply due to time. You cant be expected to fit the same amount of stuff in four ninety minute films as you can in  thirty minute episodes. But thats no excuse to fall back on tired cliche especially when that very cliche is what you were critiquing in your original work. Its hypocritical.Im not exactly sure how to boil down why NGE is so much better than the Rebuilds. Hell Im not even sure its fully quantifiable. But when I finished watching NGE I felt different. I felt like I knew more about myself and the people around me. I felt like I needed to make a change in my life. And honestly I will be utterly shocked if . manages to pull that off.,evangelion,cojcgit,11,t5_2r6ex

3875133,0,t3_34tl72,Its totally acceptable that youre confused. The Evangelion series is like that. Just make sure you get on the Rebuild series because the ride does not stop.  Firstly Shinji never actually became a god. Rei says in a monologue in one of the episodes that the cockpit of the Eva was the throne of the soul. That basically sums it up Shinji was basically put into a position where the deciding factor of humanity was based in his psychology. While he wasnt a godId leave that to Adam Lilith or anyone that can manifest an anti AT field he was the deciding factor for the apocalypse.    The real gods in the series are Adam and Lilith the first  Angels. Humanity comes entirely from Lilith the Angels come entirely from Adam. However with the first set of Evangelion units Unit  incorporated DNA from Adam and the unit Shinji was responsible for had a portion of Lilithdue to the contact experiment with Rei. Essentially Shinji was seated in this Lilithlike entity with his mother being the medium for the planets apocalypse.  also swallowed the S engine of Zeruel thus further bridging the gap between robot and Godthe Eva series did not have an inherent S engine as this was only seen in Angels becauseiirc the S engine was the fruit of life and humans have only come equipped with the fruit of knowledge.    Rei was a vessel for partly Lilith partly YuiShinjis mum. There were  Rei characters. One was choked with Naoko andspeculatively but with good evidence shoved into unit  soul first. Thats why  is a malfunctioning unit. With unit  being built more of Reis soul was shoved in to act as the medium for Shinji to pilot itas well as to give Gendo some control of the u preventable apocalypse. Rei initially was born in a laboratory that has a lot of images related to quantum physics and this provides the explanation for how Rei randomly appears and disappears in some scenessuch as the beginning of the show. People speculate Rei is a quantum being and is available anywhere in time and space.     Gendo worked with SEELE because basically the end of the world was unavoidable but by jumping on the wagon hed at least have some say in it. Regardless of whether Gendo was a bum on the street or was working for NERV the Angels were still to attack and SEELE would have still progressed with their plans. Gendo cooperated by throwing his wife under the bus. His wife was also very cooperative however  when they tried to salvage her soul from  after it went in she decided to not come out. This Rei Shinji Unit  and  and him and Fuyutsuki were all attempts at him taking care of instrumentality.    However at the End of Eva Rei rejects Gendo. Rei is Lilith and Gendo attempts to force Adam into the equation. Gendo forgot that Rei was not Rei  who had just died and was actually Rei . He forced himself into Rei . Rei  was not as obedient as  something that Gendo overlooked and he was rejected from the plans of instrumentalityat least in the way he desired.    Youre looking at the revelation stage all wrong though. So now we have the forbidden fusion of Adam and Lilith in the equation. Rei who houses part of Lilith takes Adam from Gendo and returns into Lilith. Shinji is in unit  and  is born from Lilith with the soul of Shinjis mother Yui. Instrumentality begins and everyones soul on earth combines inside of Lilith. This happens because Lilith manifests an anti AT field. AT fields are what distinguishes people from one another the wall that closes off everyones hearts. Without AT fields everyone would just be goopwhich is what we see. Lilith creates an anti AT field across the planet and combines all souls into one. When Shinji is tripping in unit  hes basically . seeing images of everyone elsebecause all souls are combinedthere is one clip of ghostly mermaid Reis swimming around inside of Lilith and . being asked what he wants from his mom who is the medium for figuring out what Shinji wants. Most of the scenes in instrumentality is Shinjis psychology being deciphered  his abandonment issues his issues with Asuka etc. and in the very end when he gets over his childish problems he basically says Im okay with the world. This symbolizes Shinjis reformation of his AT field which puts life back on earth. The scene where hes talking to Rei in the orange oceanthe world without AT fields basically tells us exactly this.,evangelion,cqxzyhc,6,t5_2r6ex

4180996,0,t1_crwtepv,Ooh baby. ok. The Oedipus complex is a psychological theory thought up by Sigmund Freud. It basically says that you subconsciously desire your mother and hate your father because he already has your mother. Its named after the Greek myth of Oedipus a guy who unknowingly killed his father and married his mother.In Evangelion Shinji obviously hates his father. But what about his mother? Well this is where it gets interesting. A common theme in Greek myth was that the mother is deconstructed into two charactersa beautiful youthful attractive one and a horrible monstrous one think Medusa. Can you see how this fits in Evangelion? Rei is the beautiful youthful mother. The Eva is the horrible monstrous mother. Shinji is attracted to Rei but his father already has a close relationship with her. In the end Shinji gets the girl when Rei chooses him over Gendo during third impact. They do the whole tumbling down thing which is pretty sexual and then theres that scene where Shinji crushes his father with the eva.Not to mention the fact that Shinji enters into the Eva that houses his mothers soul safe in a watery plug as if he were returning to the womb. This is the aspect of the Oedipus complex of wanting to return to your mother and become one again. TLDR Shinji hates his dad metaphorically fucks his mom just like Oedipus. Freud is pleased.,evangelion,crwu5e5,91,t5_2r6ex

Evangelion is deeply philosophical and sociological. It explores the human condition as I have yet to seen outside Ingmar Bergmans movies.Not only does this show entertain you and show you what it is to be human but also teach you things about yourself. Every time I rewatch it I get fixated on something new. Right now its Kaji. Have you guys realized just how together Kaji has his shit? Like especially in contrast with everyone else. He seems to be the absolute only character out of every single one of them who is not desperately lonely. It feels almost as a projection of who Shinji wants to be.

6222294,0,t1_cywncn0,It is my understanding that the Angels had come to Earth for a new home world of sorts. The main problem in the plan is of course the humans. Having basically taken over the world they had laid claim to before they had even obtained the technology necessary to counter them would be considered the ultimate insult and without any means of communication to even remotely rectify the situation the only course of action possible is the expulsion of mankind from the surface of the Earth.It would make perfect sense for the Angels to not send absolutely everything at their disposal to Earth as a backup plan to make use of a different planet if all else failed. The Angels would have certainly have thought that through as they couldnt have guaranteed success of the Third Impact after the Second one failed its intended goal  years prior. The future for Angel conquest of Earth was just too uncertain to risk putting all of their eggs in one basket. However that backup plan would have only been temporary as they targeted Earth for some reason or another rather than Mars or the Moon or anywhere else. They needed a home that had life existing already to justify the colonization of a planet for their own future survival prospects. It is only inevitable that mankind would come to face the Angels again in the future. The first backup plan had probably already been exhausted in the  years before the year of Third Impact which is why they returned.This is likely going to be a case of history repeating itself until the Angels can finally colonize Earth and purge mankind.,evangelion,cywwofl,1,t5_2r6ex

9267398,0,t1_d8qnh7e,Whether or not Rei Q has a soul is debatable though likely not categorically false we just know from Kaworu that its not a normal soul. Heck none of the Reis really had a normal soul except maybe Rei I since its theorized that Rei Is soul was split somehow to create Unit . I can see how it could be interpreted that Rei has been stripped of her soul and therefore very character in order to make a point about how her fans would still love her but even if that is the case I dont think that sentiment lasts the entire film. Every version of Rei goes through the same pattern she is mostly emotionless until she is confronted by that fact which is the catalyst for her to consider who she is and who she wants to be. Even if Rei Q is Rei in name and appearance only Shinjis anger at her not being the Ayanami he knows and Maris comment about how shes not as interesting as the old Rei clearly sparks something in her. Even if she isnt the Rei that Shinji loved she will either . become that Rei to some extent since she is still one of the Ayanami clones albeit a primative one or . Reject the Rei that everyone expects her to be and will become her own person much like how Rei in the series rejects Gendos expectations by choosing Shinji over him. ,evangelion,d8qpiry,2,t5_2r6ex

In a case like Asukas where they are simply concerned about her safety they would have no reason to put her so deeply under.
