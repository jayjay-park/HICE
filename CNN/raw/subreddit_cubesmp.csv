932599,0,t3_24s4cc,I dont know.... Im a bit tired of FFA because seasons  and  were all FFA although it would fit the pattern but the only teamsoffour UHC theyve had was the race to the Ender Dragon so I think it would be nice to have a regular teamsoffour UHC. ,cubesmp,chaahsx,4,t5_30wtj

999348,0,t3_25jwfc,Yeah a lot of the Cube members already want it so itll probably happen some day but its difficult to decide what it should look like because anything too big would look out of place... ,cubesmp,chhvtfx,1,t5_30wtj

1040151,0,t3_260jxy,Weve got a tiny problem.. Huahwi isnt on the Cube.Although Huahwi is rumored to be in UHC S he mentioned it and he was in Grasers SG and Grape did say that he considers himself friends with Huahwi.. we will get that fight soon.

1048439,0,t3_2629y2,Rooting for Will in this season raise ur kiingtongers In all seriousness Grape seems to be in a good scenario but he needs to make an iron sword. Full hearts and already has full iron. I cringe over Devon still using a wooden sword. Parker seems to be much more experienced with the UHC game so he may have a good chance for winning. Graser already lost  hearts and has no armor as of yet so hes in a really bad situation and he most likely wont win this season. Sky and Fin are probably unable to play due to internet problems or will have a very late start in the game and be unable to win or get killed early on. Straub and Bees bad connections may cause theyre downfall remember that Straub almost died to PatClone and was down to  hearts even though he stood in front of Pat the entire time and hit him constantly. In my eyes the possible winners for this UHC are going to be either Parker MM HBomb Grape Will or Bayani. There may be more but those are my predictions from the first episode.,cubesmp,chngnaj,1,t5_30wtj

1211296,0,t3_27zf20,Oh yeah thats true. I never even remembered that. I guess Grape never told him or Graser just forgot.,cubesmp,ci5w0o5,1,t5_30wtj
1228477,0,t3_27nayn,I have an idea that one of the Cube Members could possibly do at spawn. Its an Insurance Agency. Charge willing Cube Members a certain about of diamonds or other currency per month and in return they get coverage on their stuff when they die. For example they could make Basic Coverage which could be tools and Premium coverage could be armor and tools both varying in prices. You could also have it that if they are dying constantly they have to pay more just like when you use your insurance IRL. I also think it would be a good build for inside the skyscraper when Straub is finished. Just an idea ,cubesmp,ci7tl4k,3,t5_30wtj
1228808,0,t3_286fmn,Please add a flair they are important for posts.  That wouldnt be a bad idea really I think it would make the cube have more nature in it. There are no trees around...,cubesmp,ci7uxbd,1,t5_30wtj

1337123,0,t1_cik0ezf,I agree.I actually watched  different perspectives yesterday and they all seemed to have spawned at the border. This is going to be an interesting season.,cubesmp,cik1jac,1,t5_30wtj
1352124,0,t1_cilqom7,He said he doesnt care if other people vlog him or show his face he just wont be doing it on his channel.,cubesmp,cils3hs,1,t5_30wtj
1358089,0,t3_29ia5r,Honestly I think the polls are way too much. A lot of the time theyre not relevant or interesting in my opinion. I really think polls should only be posted for two reasons   . when a Cube member wants to get a read on the audience and posts a poll himherself. just for fun when something big is coming up and we want to see what everyone thinks whos going to win UHC? whos going to win the PVP tournament? etcIf polls are posted too often people just get annoyed and your overall responses will go down.  This makes important polling more difficult in the future. Id really like to get the sub to the point where if say Graser was trying to figure out his next project or Bayani was trying to figure out his next build they could come to the sub and post a poll to get the viewerships opinion. Right now were really not at that point due to the massive amounts of polls that are posted as well as the high concentration of poorly written posts that are solely looking for attention... but thats a story for a different day and doesnt involve you at allI love all the dedication you and Classic have to the subreddit! However I personally think you guys should cut back on polls  maybe once a week tops. But thats just my opinion and the other mods dont necessarily agree with me so feel free to continue on however you see fit! ,cubesmp,cimiyxn,1,t5_30wtj

1391900,0,t1_ciqpuog,GUYZ CHILL OUT. Fred just want to build a fan server for Cube fans. You guys dont have to make a fight. Some might disagree some agree. Im not taking sides. One day Cube might make it official but for now its an unofficial server but cant we all agree that this fan server is one of the first server to start out well. Its both official and unofficial in a way or two. Dont fight wether which side is right or wrong when you guys are both right. It doesnt really have to be official to be online. Its not run by thembut based on. Go watch Grasers video when he said UHC was now Cube UHC Explains Cube categories and branding. Now stop the fight and thrive the fan server. I know it doesnt make sense.,cubesmp,ciqr7on,2,t5_30wtj
