19197,0,t3_1ubmq0,I dont think there is a right answer but I wish I got it before school. Wouldnt be a bad idea to find out if flying is what you really want your degree in. If not youre a private pilot! Also at UND since the PPL flight portion is shorterlessons as opposed to  youre more likely to finish within  years. You could save money that way. For me it took  months and about  to finish my ppl courseone of my friends spent . It also depends on how much studying you do. Anyways had to stay in ND for a summer to get caught up summer tuition was expensive. From the students that did get their PPL first Ive heard some people having trouble getting used to the UND Bubble since we do things differently.Source Be work at admissions.

91529,0,t3_1v5bxg,It can be common  the single biggest reason I got out of renting! You should check with your FBO to see if they have discounted block time when you prepurchase x hours. Next check to make sure youre getting a competitive rate. How much are you spending to rent? Are there any clubs or partnerships local to you? Often buying in to a th share of an aircraft or joining a club with minimal dues can be much less expensive and more fun than just renting at an FBO.Lastly get a few buddies to fly with you and split the costs.

98878,0,t3_1v80fc,Obviously its just a model however I dont  think the design makes sense. The way the engines are oriented would present monumental forces on the tail section about the horizontal axis. It also doesnt have a good place to put the rudders. Single engine performance is really only an issue among small propeller driven aircraft. The aerodynamic slipstream is one of the factors that aids in rudder effectiveness. Even if you added rudders behind the engines they would be too close and the arm of the down wash wouldnt be long enough to create a significant moment. Most importantly I dont see how this would help single engine performance at all. Reducing adverse yaw can really only be done by reducing the effects caused by pfactor prop design or reducing the thrust arm by placing thrust at or closer to the centerline Cessna skymaster.Aside from the challenges posed by physics I dont see people jumping at the design. Im not saying unique designs dont exist but it seems like youre trying to reinvent the wheel with little posed benefit. ,flying,cepor4q,2,t5_2qm1t

Youll likely have to demonstrate stalls both power on and power off steep turns etc. basic maneuvers  they dont have to be perfect or within any limits like on a checkride just show you know what youre doing.

I was squeamish with power adjustments on final for a long time until my instructor damn near slapped me for not making large enough adjustments. If youre on the glideslope you want but starting to fall pump in some power to keep you there. Sure airline pilots dont normally do that but youre not an airline pilot.Another tip my CFI pounded into my thick skull was that if you are about to float too far on a short field let the plane come down rough and early if a goaround is not an option. The key here is let it. That is freeze and let the plane fall. Dont flare more to lighten the impact unless youre positively plummeting from like  or so. Dont try to make it pretty.

Then note magnetic hdg turn on the battery se if the hdg changed. Then do this for all equipment if you find no fault I would probably go to a technician... Well you have to do it if you find a fault too but it is probably easier to fix if you know the problem!

Entry and fixed costs are a fraction of what they would be for a whole plane and typically you end up with a much lower wet rate for your trouble.  If you manage to get into a bigger club with more planes that solves the sauce problem too.Biggest downside is that you get tied to an area  if youre still in schoolnot really on a career path yet I can see that being quite a dealbreaker.

But the seats in a  or  are more like bench seats in a minivan where youre sitting upright and you cant rest your feet in a position that keeps your toes well off of the brakes.It sounds difficult to slide your feet up while on the rollout but in practice its not too bad. In fact for me it has been a good way to remind myself to make sure Im fully on the ground and have killed all lift before I start putting on the brakes  or if on a touchandgo it gives me a better chance to maintain directional control on the ground as I retract flaps carb heat in and add power.

834538,0,t3_23ojlp,The FAA has held in the past that you do not need to maintain a second class medical in order to act as PIC when giving instruction as a CFI.  Their interpretation of the regulations is that you are not charging on the basis of your Commercial license but for your instructional abilities which are supported by your CFI.As such I fully expect that you would be able to give discovery flights as a CFISport without a Commercial license as they are flight instruction and thus falls within your CFISport privileges.If you want to dot all your Is and cross all your ts make sure that you and the student both log the flight... but since instruction given doesnt become something else when not logged even that isnt crucial to the argument.,flying,cgz50vm,2,t5_2qm1t

When youre going more or less straight you dont want to use the brakes for directional control this is more for turns. Just remember that there is some delay and you dont want to overcontrol. If no turn is happening you may need slightly more power and a little brake to start the turn. You want to be as smooth as possible so jamming the throttle forwards and slamming on a brake is not desirable  be gentle yet ensure the plane is doing what you want it to.

991886,0,t1_chgva58,As far as wearables go Google Glass is already starting to look quaint.  CastAR is a pair of polarized glasses with projectors that project separate images outward for each eye to create D augmented reality that updates in real time as you move your head around.  The image only is visible on special screen material so it doesnt interfere with your vision elsewhere.  Its designed to allow holographic tabletop games like the monster chess board in Star Wars by just laying a sheet of screen over a table. The technology would be directly useful for flight simulators because you could replace all the expensive projection equipment with a pair of the glasses for the pilot and the instructor then just hang screen material over the windows and gain D in the process.After a decade of development its possible that a transparent coating of some sort could be used as a screen for the projectors.

994450,0,t3_25hv8s,You do not have to worry about automation within the airlines. The FAA is notoriously slow on certification processes and the certification and regulation of automatedor even singlepilot airlines would be significant. There are also many technical hurdles that would have to be overcome mainly there simply is not enough bandwidth available for automated or remote communications due to cellular traffic. All of these things will have to be solved first. The only areas where you would see a decrease in pilot employment due to drones are . The air force where it would make sense to reduce piloted aircraft in hazardous areas and . Part  operations that could easily be replaced by a drone. Operations such as power line and waterway inspection or crop dusting. Case in point  of Japans crop dusting business is handled by a fleet of  or so drone helicopters.

While doing so we found that a heat wrap had slipped while we were in there and the turbo manifold was burning up one wire.  Always a silver lining .Otherwise the guy did a pretty neat job just that those fuel quantity wires were backwards...We were sitting here debating what the ruling would have been had I run it dry and had to put it in a cow pasture.  You could argue that it would run fine on a tank that was indicating empty because that tank was not in fact empty.  And that upon discovering good fuel in a tank that indicated empty the pilot should then proceed to the nearest airport on that tank.But you could also argue that the mechanic gave the pilot inaccurate instrumentation by negligence and the POH says to run the plane on both unless an indicated imbalance requires switching to balance the tanks.  Indicated imbalance procedure per the POH was followed and that inaccurate instrumentation made the problem worse.Wouldve been an interesting investigation had the worst happened I guess.,flying,cio7tjq,1,t5_2qm1t

You wouldnt want to try . for that case since two way communications are available already.It looks like Palmdale VOR falls under the same scenario though it almost seems kind of ridiculous because the standalone Lancaster RCO is right next to it. My guess is that it has something to do with the high altitude service volume of Palmdale VOR and the same goes for Linden VOR from earlier.I honestly have no idea why Clovis VOR lists a flight service station underneath it if it doesnt provide any radio outlets.

1701495,0,t3_2dvz50,gtWhy are helicopter flight lessons more expensive?Because helicopters are more expensive to fly.  The moving parts are more numerous and require more maintenance.gtLets say I get a private pilots license for airplanes what then?You could do your helicopter addon... but you can at least call yourself a pilot!  Not sure what you are asking here.gtDoes this just become an expensive hobby?You say that like its a bad thing.  Yes its EXPENSIVE.  But at the same time like uxtcg said it opens up so many opportunities that normal people just cant have.gtIf I get an airplane license what is the process for also getting helicopter? Start over from the beginning?Not quite.  Youll know airspace radio comms and how airports work youll legally need to fly some hours in the helicopter of course but it wont be nearly as many as if you were starting fresh in a swingwing.gtWith a private pilots license are there restrictions on how far you can fly? Can you literally fly across the United States if you wanted to?No limitations but your physical stamina and the airplanes capabilities.  Keep in mind most small aircraft fly around  MPH and have a range of  hours.  So while you COULD do Long Beach to Long Island in a day that would be a poor decision because youd be exhausted halfway there.You also need to keep terrain in mind.  Not a big problem for flatlanders but going from Denver to Seattle involves at least a  climb.  Not that I have specific knowledge in that area.Also weather destroys the bestlaid plans unless you have an instrument rating and even then youll need to remain flexible.gtwhat do I do next? Does it just become something I say I can do and maybe only fly every couple of months?Thats not a great idea primarily because you should really keep up your proficiency.  Honestly youll find reasons to fly.  Going with friends or coworkers your SO if applicable and other pilots  flying is its own reason to go flying.  I can understand how one might assume that you just quit doing it but my experience is that you just get addicted.Doing it all in a summer is smart.

1721513,0,t3_2e4qak,gt  Is doing primary training in a   Cardinal ... finding a CFI thats ok with that?TLDR The fact that its a cardinal is the last thing that should stop you from buying it.This is the only thing I can really weigh in on other than yes flying is a really expensive hobby without much practical upside other than personal fulfillment which I think is worth a lot.  The upshot is if Cessna had their way they would have stopped producing s in the early s in favor of the .  It was fully intended to replace the  and is a better plane in a lot of ways.  The biggest differences I can think of off hand are the obvious missing strut.  I like it aesthetically and it also reduces drag to increases airspeed but not by much Flying stabilator.  Probably as a direct nod to Piper they swapped out the classic elevator setup in favor of the stabilator on the cardinal.  Its a more efficient more effective lifting surface that should again reduce drag and bump airspeed but not by much. The most important and one of the more subtle differences is the cockpit position.  The pilot sits well forward of the wing which increases visibility especially in wingdown turning attitudes allowing the pilot to maintain visual contact with the airport during an entire approach.  Thats a pretty big deal especially if you plan on doing any IFR flying in your career most CFIs would recommend.  It also improves your ability to scan for traffic in the base to final turn which is another critical improvement over classic highwing designs.  Plus there arent many sexier rooflines in aviation than the .  Plane looks good on the ramp IMHO.So overall Id definitely say the model is worth serious consideration if youre serious about getting into ownership.,flying,cjw5sde,2,t5_2qm1t

Until youre  comfortable with the capabilitieslackof the aircraft including stalls I wouldnt consider flying in the clouds with no reference to the groundany kind of instrument work it can be very disorienting.. I am currently getting both ratings simultaneously and while I think the instrument rating is very important you need to be be entirely confident in your flying skills before moving onto more complex capabilities and ratings.. Also the aerobatic training helps you understand WHY the airplane is doing what it is doing making it less intimidating and scary. Best of luck!,flying,cky6xd3,1,t5_2qm1t
2033236,0,t1_cky9es4,After some selfdoubt due to the  votes I checked back with a Weight and Balance specialist that I use. Im a DAR so I have a reasonable handle on what causes what but I like to check with the gurus when it comes to complex issues or ones where Im not sure Im across the issue fully.Long story short what I said was right. In his opinion as well the cutoff corner of the envelope on the C should be more cut off than it is. Its not that there isnt a safety factor involved its just that at that point youre starting to see the first effects of what that cutoff corner is for. Its the limit at which the elevator doesnt have the authority to increase the AoA to a stall angle at low speed. It also reduces structural load on the nosewheel but thats not its main job. If there wasnt the safety factor andor you were operating too far out of the envelope along that line you wouldnt be able to flare the aircraft to land at all and would simply slam into the runway. As I said before what you were seeing is the first manifestation of that.,flying,cky9opz,2,t5_2qm1t

If you have an aft CG there is nothing you can do short of artificial stabilization and artificial stabilization can only cope with slightly aft CG and requires extremely highspeed actuators and fast feedback.

2313141,0,t3_2lrpaf,There isnt a correlation between flap extension and rollcontroller spoiler activation on the BgtFlight SpoilersFour flight spoilers are located on the upper surface of each wing. Each hydraulic system A and B is dedicated to a different set of spoiler pairs to provide isolation and maintain symmetric operation in the event of hydraulic system failure. Hydraulic pressure shutoff valves are controlled by the two flight SPOILER switches.Flight spoiler panels are used as speed brakes to increase drag and reduce lift both in flight and on the ground. The flight spoilers also supplement roll control in response to control wheel commands. A spoiler mixer connected to the aileron cabledrive controls the hydraulic power control units on each spoiler panel to provide spoiler movement proportional to aileron movement.The flight spoilers rise on the wing with up aileron and remain faired on the wing with down aileron. When the control wheel is displaced more than approximately  spoiler deflection is initiated.As previously posted at slower speeds you need a larger control input to achieve the same roll moment therefore a bigger control wheel deflection therefore more frequent rollcontrol spoiler activation.,flying,clxmba4,12,t5_2qm1t

2393127,0,t3_2mprgt,One thing I noticed is you werent properly briefed on how to break in the engine. A rapid cooling simulated emergency engine out procedure is the LAST thing you want to be doing to a newly overhauled engine. You need to run this engine HARD for the first  hours. Cruise close to RPM redline no touch and Gos no economy cruise long hard cross countries. The rings in the piston need to seat into the cylinder walls for a proper break in and if you go easy on the engine right now youre causing a lot of expensive problems with your cylinders down the road. Also be sure to put ONLY straight  mineral oil in right now no W or W Plus. The anti friction additives will prevent proper break in.You said a total overhaul was performed does that include the magnetos? A rough running engine can be cause by burned points. If the magneto was overhauled were the coils replaced? We had a recent overhaul on a magneto but with no coil replacement and it caused a lot of similar problems a couple months later. Its also worth mentioning if you pull the throttle all the way back what is the lowest RPM that it will idle at? The popping youre hearing in the exhaust sounds like unburned fuel exiting the exhaust. If you have an EGT monitor with a readout on all four cylinders it will make learning which cylinder is cold easier someone else mentioned this. Otherwise youll have to have an AampP monitor the exhaust pipe temps checked with the cowl off and engine running.,flying,cm7hxkq,1,t5_2qm1t

The only caveat is that in order to receive the ground station info rather than just the air to air there needs to be at least one ping from an aircraft with OUT capability.The OUT function requires a WAAS GPS receiver. That little guy will set you back between k and k to purchase in addition to the es or UAT unit the author talks about and lets call it a thousand to install there are only a few blind WAAS receivers out there and none have  TSO and are generally a  to install. So at minimum if you do not have a TSO WAAS panel unit you are going to have to bend over. There isnt a clear reason why WAAS is required.As much as I like the idea of traffic and weather and stuff Id rather pay a trifle for the IN function for traffic provide a non WAAS GPS position for the out and Id be ahead for a couple decades of XM radio fees financially for the greatly superior XM weather and such. ,flying,cm9nx57,1,t5_2qm1t

Chuck Yeager doesnt even have a degree.  An english degree is just fine.  A degree is only required if you want to be an airline pilot and they dont care what degree they just want to know that you can sit in a chair and pass tests for four years not because of any particular content you need to know.Embry Riddle exists because graduating high school kids who want to be airline pilots need to a get a college degree and b learn to fly and its easier for them if they can get both done at the same time while their parents are paying for it.The best thing you can do is not quit your day job right now and go to your closest little airplanes airport and start flying lessons.  I dont know how much it costs anymore but somewhere around k.  Start hanging out there and meeting other pilots.  Maybe even get a part time job working the flight line one day a week and meet all the pilots and managers.  If youre personable and competent people will like you and then when you get your commercial rating people might help you find a flying job.Be aware that its very unlikely that any of these jobs will ever be able to pay back the debt you would acquire at Embry Riddle.

A few other replies already address the issue.I did take a look at your cross post and I just wanted to note that you should beware the solutions you are getting. Two of the comments gave the same incorrect answer and one of them was upvoted to the top. I showed algebraically that the arithmetic the commenter had done actually gives no meaningful value. I am very surprised how many people accepted and supported the wrong answer especially when it clearly makes no sense. The commenters got different wind values for each leg when the question assumes constant wind. Even if you assume different wind on each leg their solutions are still wrong.So theres still a lesson here dont trust everything you read on reddit or anywhere else for that matter even if it gets a lot of upvotes.,flying,co891xk,1,t5_2qm1t

I guess the humor comes from using the phrase quick turn like you know what youre doing and  of the time the pilot of the plane in question is one of those im a pilot type of people.  Whereas normal people in smaller aircraft that are in a hurry usually just let you know theyre in a rush.  Its not very common to hear the phrase quick turn being used outside of the business jets.

However the MVAs there will likely put me at an altitude that risks icing Ill know for sure Saturday nightSunday morningIt looks like a better option may be sticking close to the coast flying to RZS and picking up the V from there.

If the weather is good the view is so much better. San Marcos feeds right into the Basin so that should be a good option for you depending upon what airport you are terminating at.

3278552,0,t1_cp1w2fj,Hard to say. It really depends on what youre looking to do. Prices are pretty steep for oneday registration. I want to say to say like  bucks? So yeah...not exactly cheap which is a bummer. Though if youre looking to talk to recruiters its a great chance to get some face time with one not to mention get that sweet airline swag pens mostly. They also have some great education sessions and speaker panels about various topics. I cant say if that alone would be worthwhile but they go on for a few hours after the exhibit hall closes. With the exhibit hall I have to warn you that in the last few years some of the big exhibitors mostly major airlines have been swamped. So if you want to talk with one maybe two depending how fast lines are moving you need to get there early. They do some form of fastpass option but I dont really know how they all work since Im not really at that point in my career to make waiting in line worthwhile so I havent done the research on that. However most companies that arent major airlines you can just walk up and talk to. Also the exhibit hall closes at  on Saturday and many start to wrap up after ish. All said and done if you have the extra cash Id say go for it. If youre a little strapped next year might be a better option. If you register early usually the first cutoff is around December you can pretty much get registered for the whole conference for the price of a single day is at the door. Hope this helps a little. If you have other questions ask away! This is conference number  for me. ,flying,cp1zc4t,1,t5_2qm1t

3486743,0,t3_306x86,. regarding safety Even if you stop at a PPL always treat flying as if you are doing it professionally. Its all about attitude for things under your control. Obviously there are also factors outside of your control but the element of risk is inherent in anything we do. For example if your wife is worried about engine failures ask her how often does your car engine fail? With a good AampP mechanic airplanes are generally maintained far more meticulously than automobiles and with a flight school especially safety is a top priority. Hesston seems to have a decent program and Ive seen them come to up KSLN many times for checkrides. I am a graduate of KSUs aviation program at KSLN for the record.. regarding studyingground school This varies upon individual study habits. Some people are very disciplined self learners while others may be better off in a more traditional classroom setting. Personally I think having both would be the most beneficial for most people but again this is will depend on your own study habits.. regarding IR Id worry about this after you get a PPL honestly.. regarding avionics I still think its better to start with analog instrumentation to learn the very basics for PPL students. Its usually easier to transition from analog to digital compared to the other way around. You should definitely learn how to use a GPS though because thats not going away anytime soon.. Of course youll make mistakes when learning to fly. A competent CFI will let you make mistakes but not to the point where it will endanger you.. A Cessna R model has around  lbs payload capability for pax  cargo  fuel. Full fuel tanks will reduce that to around  lbs for people and cargo.  adults probably wont cut it but  younger kids might be doable. For seaters youll probably want to look at a Bonanza or something. I dont know much about operating costs for privately owned aircraft or flying with infantstoddlers unfortunately.. Usually LSA or aircraft with really short takeoff distances arent going to have much payload capability even compared to a C. But I would have to do research on this matter to be perfectly honest.. Pilots N Paws is another one that I have heard about but I dont know the exact details on it.Now that being said ask yourself these questions again after you take your intro flight to see if flying is something you really want to do.Edit Formatting,flying,cppppiy,2,t5_2qm1t

The first three are also...yeah...big and flat regardless of how busy and not much in the way of restricted space or terrain.My only complaint with DFW controllers is going west and getting vectored past DTO due to KDFW when Im trying to to get out from say...Addison to El Paso.  I mean goddamn I get that you and Im saying you as in the FAA not you as in the controllers want to keep GA clear of airlines but hey you are the ones who put Maverick as the anchor point in every...single...low altitude departure.  Thats why I really loathe going to the interior DFW airports and live at KTKI.  It doesnt matter to a  if they get vectored all the way around the grand tour of the metro area theyre just out joyriding anyway.  But the light twins and high performance piston singles are the ones who get screwed.  We dont have tuboprop departures and arrivals just for us we get thrown in with the s despite the fact that were double their speed and approach is too busy with heavy traffic to do anything different.  So the grand tour is just the first kick in the balls the second one is when I get told to expect visual and switched to tower and instantly told to slow down because Im  behind two students in s reading  knots GS in the pattern.At KTKI I dont have to deal with this if I dont want to as long as Ive got VFR minimums to arrive and depart in.  I dont think anyone could get me to keep my plane at Addison or Love field even if the hangar were free due to the above.  ,flying,cpsk1ee,1,t5_2qm1t

4125356,0,t1_crqe077,The sad part is I do somewhat agree with you. I was in class with some CTI that had no right being there in the first place. Im not here to say that CTI was the best method of training controllers but I will say it was a way to find people who are committed to the profession. Advertising a job over the radio that offers a  figure salary in a desirable location encourages people to apply.  But what happens when they get assigned to Grand Forks ND making not nearly the salary? Do they remain committed to the profession? The thing is the FAA went about this hiring change completely wrong they have turned ATC into a lottery system. Theres literally nothing you can do anymore apart from military to work towards this profession. They have discarded passionate people who worked for years towards this and at the very least deserve an opportunity to prove their merit especially since the FAA told them this was the route to take to become an ATC. Hiring people based on school alone is dumb but when a candidate has proven they can handle a challenging complex fastpaced work environment and then is passed up by someone who just graduated high school and has worked as a waiter for  years that is significantly more dumb.,flying,crqikqt,1,t5_2qm1t

4399437,0,t3_3b0i0l,In this situation I think its totally up to you but...When you pull many of these old junky airplanes back to idle on the ground they will die their idle screw is probably set too low. These engines have fixed timing and run like absolute dogshit at anything less than ish rpm and some wont even do that.  So when I get to the check idle part of the checklist I just make sure it stays running at about rpm if theres more travel back on the throttle I just wont go there. Second like the others were saying and its totally true. Once youre moving the engine will never quit due to too low of an idle setting. Have you ever killed the engine while flying? Its not nearly as scary as it sounds as long as you are not flying too slow the prop will continue to turn. My guess is if you took that same warrior and pulled the throttle completely out to the same place it was dying on the ground youd still be turning rpm in the air even if you did pull the mixture to cutoff.,flying,csljuhe,1,t5_2qm1t

Im not all that thrilled with any fraction of the mindset that we should give people rides to get them interested in GA. Not only does it seem too similar to certain religious behaviour pyramid schemes or the drug dealers free sample as some people like to use the addiction analogy to which I take exception but what exactly does it accomplish? If you offered an allexpenses paid PPL I bet youd get people lining up out the door. The problem with GA is not the lack of willing people  its a matter of costs. It isnt sustainable to get just a couple of guys with money into the field since it doesnt address the root cause.My only interest in inviting others on flights is to have fun and maybe grab something to eat.

If you need a line to use on someone like that just use Im only comfortable discussing medical issues with my practicing physician.Also ethically this is very questionable. The AMA wouldnt be very happy about someone berating a patient for lapsed care. All it does in the end is dissuade a patient from trying to get necessary care if they have let some necessary checkups lapse.  The FAA woukd probably agree as do most good physicians. They know smoking is bad and they will try to help a smoker stop if they are willing. But they also know that berating a smoker will usually have one effect  the smoker will stop seeing the doctor rather than stop smoking.

Acceptable drop on most Lycomings is somewhere around  per mag but the important thing is that the drops are even.Next time you get a rough mag chech during a runup put the switch in both and slowly pull the mixture until right before the engine dies there should be a slight increase in RPM if its adjusted right let it run for   seconds or so then go back to full rich and try the mag check again. ,flying,ctnhwad,7,t5_2qm1t

5059458,0,t1_cuvu1uh,Not sure if any of these other answers explain the displaced threshold clearly enough so Ill go ahead and take a stab.  Its the same reason people are expressing concern about the trees near the area you want to use.While a runway is a given length  feet you cant always expect to land at the very start of that runway.  Typically when the FAA engineers this stuff they use a  degree slope to the touchdown point they expect pilots to use typically located  feet from the start of the actual concrete.  Looking at that  degree slope approach to the runway they then evaluate if anything gets in the way such as trees or mountains.  If they can cut down the trees they will.  But some things like mountains or buildings are more difficult to modify.  In those cases the FAA will either increase the slope  degrees is about the most Ive seen but more often they move the desired touchdown zone.  So now instead of being  feet from the start of the pavement its  feet.  Based on that  degree slope this means youre now higher over those trees than youd have been if the touchdown point was in its standard location.  They then paint the runway with special markings to tell pilots hey dont land on this part.  You also are not supposed to use that part of the runway for your landing calculations.  This could lead your  foot runway to have a displaced threshold of maybe  feet.  So now its effectively a  foot runway for landing.  Thats short for most small airplanes.  Jets are completely out of the question on anything less than  feet and even thats pushing it.Best of luck as you may be realizing its a huge endeavor.  It might be a lot easier to just make your self a little strip for your own private use that way you only have to accommodate yourself and theres fewer requirements if it isnt for public use.,flying,cuvutek,5,t5_2qm1t

5297655,1,t3_3nkent,First solo was yesterday October   at  pm Central Time.  Somewhat long writeup. It was almost a month since I last flew with my instructor.  Back in early September I was supposed to have my first solo but the weather up here in Iowa never cooperated.  I arrived at the hanger at  am and began my preflight.  My instructor arrived shortly after and around noon is when we took off. We stayed in the pattern and had  touch and goes.  These were by far the best landings Ive ever had.  Even after a month of not flying with him and that plane I was able to flair better than I have before.  On the th touch and go my instructor asked me if I had my medical with me.  I told him it was in my bag ready to go whenever.  On the th landing he said go ahead and taxi back to the hanger.  I was a little disappointed because I loved doing touch and goes.  I taxied back and right when I was pulling up to the front of the hanger he turns to me and says that he was stepping out.  I couldnt believe it.  I wanted to yell FUCK YEAH but I kept my cool.  He said Youll do fine. I know you can do this. Just remember Ill be sitting right here with you the whole time. Go up and do  touch and goes. A go around does not count. He exited and I sat there for a moment.  Soaking in the reality of what was about to happen.  I listened to ATIS for the new information.  I then radioed ground and let them know I had Lima and was ready to taxi for touch and goes.  They sent me to runway   via Charlie. I then throttled up and taxied down Charlie.  While taxiing I was so damn excited that I finally realized half way down Charlie the elbow room I finally received.  I am   lbs.  I need all the elbow room I can get.  I held short of   and did my run up. After that I contacted tower and they cleared me for take off.  I centered up on   took a long deep breath and throttled up.  I was airborne in a few seconds and could not believe how fast this little airplane could climb to traffic pattern.  Without my instructor this little thing climbed like the F Raptor! Just joking I was a crew chief on the F and know what they can do. I entered the traffic pattern and my first landing was a little less than what I wanted.  The second one was way better. While in the traffic pattern for the rd touch and go I sat there and wondered for a second.  A touch and go means that I land and then go.  So I figured  touch and goes and one landing.  I came in landed and took off again.  Entered the traffic pattern and my last landing was worse than the first one. I wanted to go back up but knew this was the last one. Sioux City Tower asked if this was my first solo. I said yes sir and they congratulated me and said I did great.  I taxied back to the hanger and my instructor meet me right when I shut down. He said Congratulations youre now a pilot. These last few years have been pretty shitty for me since I got out the military. This was the most rewarding thing to hear since  when I was given crew chief of the week a month before I was told I would be honorably discharged. I am more motivated now and cant wait to get to update my flair. ,flying,cvou4e9,1,t5_2qm1t

I was in the office with commercial pilots and they seemed to have to undergo a bit more than I did ECG. Felt cool when they wished me luck after on receiving my license  My point is more that we obviously dont want pilots having medical emergencies while flying. Isnt that the purpose of obtaining medical clearance? When this kind of thing happens Im sure the FAA will take that into consideration when reviewing its processes. The reason I brought up the medical was to let ScottG know that there are medical requirements. And that pilots medical history is taken into account.

If you run enough at least  chances are youll get some real world sale prices for a couple of them.

The one person who did not study Engineering studied some kind of social science and came out with a high GPA. The aviation program is geared more towards people who want to work in civilian aviation and only that. A flight degree for something like software development is as good as an English degree.If you want to be a test pilot or be involved in aeronautical research of any kind a tech degree is not the way to go.

You have to take the top access panel off the fuel tank. This usally requires and impact drill with a screw bit because those screws get corroded. You disconnect the vent line at the tank and pull it out the rear inspection hole under the strut fairing. If you do this mod it cut out about  of the normal fuel dripping.

5680062,0,t3_3sx9k2,gtHow much would i need to change in order to transition from winter to summer flying?Theres not really a whole lot.  The biggest thing is that you dont want to start an engine below about F.  So you need to plan ahead and preheat the engine so it starts when you turn the key and doesnt destroy the cylinder linings.  On your last walkaround before flying pay special attention to whether youve removed any cowl plugs blankets cords or other winterspecific nonflight covers.Youll want to dress warmer.  Not every airplane has great cabin heat or good door seals.  The challenge here is that with few exceptions GA aircraft dont have enough room to wear a good thick winter coat.  So I normally find myself wearing  hoodies with a nylontype windbreaker on top.  The other advantage of dressing this way is that you can selectively change your insulation midflight.gtWhat should i look out for or be differently aware of?Think about your emergency landing scenario  if you go down you need to think about how youll survive until SampR shows up.  This means you and your pax need adequate clothing and shoes and you should seriously consider adding blankets to whatever survival kit you have.  Some of those chemical hand warmers may be warranted as well.  Think about it.gtHow is different is navigation when everything is white?Depends on your area.  Lakes and rivers wont stand out like they do in the summer.  But towns will be a little more visible.  Night flying I find a lot easier because under any moon the ground reflects so much more moonlight.  Make sure youre night current too.gtEngine performance?The air is colder and dryer so its much denser.  More air molecules in the engine means you burn some more fuel but get some more power too.gtHow would i need to change my landings and take offs in order to make them safer for the conditions im faced with?Pay attention to runway conditions.  Most airports wont salt their movement areas too much risk of corrosion so you may find braking action low.  You may also find yourself landing on runways covered in a light dusting of snow.  Ice may be under that.  Making a low pass over a suspect runway to inspect it can be a smart move but pay attention to coordination and airspeed while doing so.gtHow about pitotcarb heat?Consult your POH but this shouldnt really be any different.,flying,cx161z0,7,t5_2qm1t

I did not get my ratings at one of those big schools but I did instruct at FSA in Vero Beach FL briefly after I got my CFI. They have way more students and planes than they have Instructors and right now they are offering free instructor ratings in return for an employment contract. Im not a fan of signing contracts myself but on the other hand you will fly your butt off from day one. Its not a perfect solution but might be worth checking out. If you do make sure you read every word of that contract and see what is negotiable. They need you just as much as you need that flight time.I was in your exact same position a few years ago. I worked the desk at a flight school after i finished my commercial single multi and instrument ratings and looked for ways to fly without getting my CFI.

5822629,0,t1_cxiust5,Well Id say that gliding sounds like a lot of fun.  Id do gliding just for the experience of it alone never mind career goals.  Also the Navy is still doing the IFS program where they basically send you to go get  hours on a Cessna or equivalent with a civilian CFI to see if youre really interested in flying.  Once you are done with Advanced and get your wings you can file with the FAA for your commercial pilots license.  I have a commercial single and multiengine license along with a type rating from my fleet aircraft.  All of that was on the Navys dime not mine.

My suggestion again is to keep it current. Over the next  years you are going to be out ? Will it cost more than  to jump through the entire process again?As for the BFR question. Once a pilot always a pilot. You dont lose your license by not getting a BFR. You lose the ability to act as PIC. When you decide to jump back in the saddle you will need a flight review and the CFI will sign you off once he feels you are safe and proficient.

The first time I landed I was like Thats it? It wasnt nearly as harrowing as I had imagined and now that Ive done it a couple of dozen times I feel like anybody with as many hours as an airline pilot has probably has it down pat by now.I recently flew on a  from KSEA to KDFW first plane Ive ever been on with a media screen. Not sure why it took me this long. Anyway I loved tracking the flight on GPS getting the flight parameters watching us get on the downwind then turn base then final.Before Id always had this vague idea of airplanes circling somehow I never knew the elements of the traffic pattern so now Im conscious of that and understand all the turns you have to make to get lined up.Also the first time I landed I finally understood what all those engine power adjustments were about! It was an amazing feeling to hear my little Rotax  make the same kind of adjustments Ive heard on an airliner. The ATC system makes me feel comfy in the air too. I only had some vague notion of harried ATC personnel before but now that I know how it all works it makes a lot more sense. Right now Im still more or less terrified of having to use the radio but Im getting better at it and people whove been at it as long as almost everyone else in the air besides me have to have something on the ball to get to that point.,flying,cxpvp51,2,t5_2qm1t

I threw out  degrees of flaps and did some quick Sturns to bleed off speed and altitude to hit the mark. No time for more flaps or speed reductions. I think I had her down to about  knots. Still a bit fastDelaying the commitment to offairportlanding is a common mistake.  Pilot did not allow time to minimize touchdown energy.  RV stall speed is  knots.  Now maybe he would have flipped over even with a lower speedenergy but he would have improved his chances if hed allowed himself timespace to optimize the landing.My primary take away is a reminder to fully commit to a deadstick landing at  AGL and if possible perform normal downwind base final legs to survey the landing area and retain the option to selectoptimizechange the touchdown spot and speed.  Allow time to optimize the landing.  Dont rush. If it were me Id want to be at stall speed when my wheels hit the loose gravel.,flying,cxwgyvm,2,t5_2qm1t

In my travels people really want to drive the plane with the control column...it is a neat thing to watch someones moment of clarity when they see that playing with the throttle in a glide configuration achieves what their brain previously thought required pointing the noise towards the ground as you say! To respond to your PS Im sure someone has but it would be extremely difficult considering how much even just a little extra power when flaring floats you like crazy...full power would take any tiny yoke manipulation and magnify it like crazy in either direction. Couple in ground effect and you would have trouble getting through the cushion of air and also the lift you would be generating at that power setting...almost like the ground wants to push you away...Of course you could enter a slow flight type of configuration at relatively high drag pitch angle and power settings...but I think your tail would be so low approaching the runway and the controls so washy that it would be a rough one to touch down...

5999453,0,t3_3xmxnt,My only problem with the Sportys learn to fly course is that it didnt teach me very much.  This could be similar to every online course but my experience is limited to Sportys.  For instance it came time to make my first XC flight plan.  I had watched the videos on this so Im good to go...or not.  First didnt know anything about true indicated and calibrated airspeed and how all of that goes into flight planning.  I watched the video again and it didnt help.  Turns out Google and the Warrior II POH taught me more than I needed to know on that point.  Further it glosses over airspace only enough to explain that different airspace exists but doesnt explain it in enough detail that you could pass an oral portion of the check ride after the video.  There are more but I will avoid a wall of text.Now if the point of the course is to gloss over everything one time and hope the students realize that there is a ton of information that needs to be absorbed then I would say it worked.  Im my case I watched all the videos tried a few practice tests and a flight plan and found many holes in my knowledge that I needed to fill.  I used the Internet and other resources to get the info.  When I tried to learn something from the Sportys course I found that it didnt teach any concept...just informed me that the concept exists.  I will give it credit for the aircraft systems and aerodynamic sections as they did somewhat teach those concepts but it was lacking in others.In my experience I could have learned the required information for ground school by reading the Airplane Flying Handbook the Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge the EB instruction book and the Warrior II POH.  It wasnt until I started taking practice exams and planning XC flights when realized the course didnt teach me anything.  If I could do it over I would skip Sportys study on my own use the ASA test study book and just get my CFI to endorse me for the written.,flying,cy624q3,3,t5_2qm1t

Now this is really just a rule of thumb. I would recommend looking into the last few months of schedules and billed time. The club I was talking about actually had a bit higher member ratio but from what I saw in the schedule there were quite a few people who either were not active or only were drilling holes in the sky and the schedule was actually fairly open the archer was the most used and the mooney was rarely used. Also most clubs allow a few extended trips with the aircraft  days. Spend some time looking into the club check out the usage of the planes inspect the planes and see how well maintained they are and ask around the airport they are based at and ask what kind of reputation they have there.

Firewalling the thrust will have the plane to  knots in a few seconds without losing any altitude. When we practice stalls at that altitude in the sims we pretty much just power out of them.

6411950,0,t3_43hk98,I witnessed a stallspin accident.I had a day off because friends from abroad were visiting and I had a bit of time before the ferry arrived. It was a really nice day so I went up to the airfield to fly around for  minutes before they arrived.When I got there there was quite a bit of activity  unusual for a weekday  there was a visiting Europa and some activity around a microlight which was having its final test flights I dont recall what type it was but basically think of a high wing light sport. This aircraft incidentally was a bit underpowered. The guy building it had just got finished and we saw it do a couple of earlier test flights and the climb rate wasnt exactly stellar. I spoke to the BMAA test pilot just before they went because I needed to move his Europa he hadnt expected anyone else to be flying and was parked in front of me. I mentioned I had a friend with a Europa but with the turboed Rotax which he poopoohed  you dont need that much power. I dunno but so long as it doesnt compromise the airframe or range I dont think you can ever have too much power!So off I went on my little bimble. The wind was from the north and off the north end of the runway are a small set of hills actually terminal moraine from the last ice age. Not really an issue for me since my aircraft has plenty of power and Im nearly  feet AGL by the time I go past them.This microlight on the other hand... while Im flying the BMAA test pilot basically goes through the aircraft checking it stalls at the right speed etc. has no adverse handling characteristics and now wants to do a last test at max gross weight. So he and the owner both get on board and line up on runway . Ive decided to do a couple of touch and goes before packing up and I extend my downwind a little bit to give them time. I see them rolling so turn base final land clean up and take off again. I lower the nose to check on their progress and I notice something white on top of the hills. At first I thought it was just a bit of farm machinery that had been hauled up there but then a guy on the ground says on the radio I think they crashed! so I look again and level off. Sure enough theres the wrecked aircraft just below the top of the hill. I circle overhead and see someone crawling out of the wreckage and tell the person on the radio that Ive seen life then circle up higher switch to . and report the crash. A Royal Navy Sea King crew hears the call on . and is not too far south and diverts to our position. The Sea King crew ended up taking the front seater the BMAA pilot to hospital the owner in the back seat goes by a normal ambulance having not suffered life threatening injuries.What happened is that the aircraft got in the clutching hand of the hills. When we are towing gliders in that direction we never climb out over the hills because of this problem. While he was trying to turn the aircraft away from the hills he stalled and began an incipient spin. Fortunately they crashed going downhill so the aircraft didnt come to a sudden dead stop which would have killed both of them but contacted the ground at an angle much less than  degrees and slid for a bit. The guy in the front seat was seriously injured having got the engine in his lap. The back seater crawled out the wreckage unaided this is the person who I had seen exiting the aircraft and suffered IIRC a broken arm.,flying,czih2s6,4,t5_2qm1t

6459835,0,t1_cznh8bk,Its the speed at which youre theoretically committed to flight as well as takeoff safety speed  see here  but of course if youre a light plane on a big runway you could in practice stop after V and even after rotationtakeoff  it has occurred before but its not generally recommended. Youre correct that its a little counterintuitive that in some cases youd be able to stop after V or even rotation but how else could you define V that wouldnt have this problem? Shortly after Vr youre off the runway anyway and then decision speed makes no sense because youre climbing at a preset speed and not accelerating any more. The only way to really fix this problem would be to calculate a decision POINT on the runway i.e. if you are on the ground and braking before you reach this point on the runway you can safely stop but thats hugely more complex than calculating a speed and brings very little benefit. ,flying,cznhnhy,-4,t5_2qm1t

Note that the reason the PoH gives for not using carb heat is that it reduces thrust that might be needed for a go around but we are trained to go carb heat cold at  AGL in anticipation of a GA and of course to go carb heat cold when initiating a go around so I dont really see a downside. ,flying,czq1yxr,1,t5_2qm1t

I also skydive and we have a basic safety regulation from the USPA that says youre not allowed to jump a camera until you have  jumps. The reasoning behind this is that once there is a camera involved you become more focused on where the camera is pointing instead of what youre supposed to be doing i.e. flying the airplane. I know everyone is different and thats a sweeping generalization but it holds somewhat true for all of us. I personally have never flown with a gopro and never will unless its something memorable I want to capture.

Theres surprisingly little that you need to remember when flying VRF but IFR is different.You have to know the right thing to do when things start to fall apart the system only works if you do what theyre expecting you to do and IMHO some of it is against common sense like if you lose radio contact while being vectored in busy airspace then youre expected to fly direct to the place you were being vectored even if you know it will shut down pretty much all other traffic while theyre making room for you  my instinct would be to get the hell out of the way.

But Id say If you can tell the difference between when the mains hit and the nose gear hits thats good enough to me. Lastly and most importantly I noticed on your last landing that you nosed down crossing the threshold at ft. DONT DO THAT. You were most likely trying to gain airspeed but dont do what you did. Thats a great way to nose it into the ground. If youre a little slow add power and lessen aft stick pressure to maintain approach speed. Thats why I dont like pitch for airpseed power for altitude.

Keep the turn coordinated and keep the load factor low you shouldnt feel yourself squished into your seat or sliding around in it  that will keep you from stalling and if you dont stall you wont spin.As to what I suggest for shaking the fear Grab an instructor by the collar and drag them up with you. Fly a few square patterns at altitude practice some Sturns down low and then shoot a few landings flying a pattern size appropriate to the aircraft youre flying.  If youre concerned about wind gusts catching you and pushing you into a steeper bank than youd like then go practice on a nice gusty day.,flying,d0l71em,1,t5_2qm1t

Day of the flight get the winds aloft at your desired altitude  use that to get the course correction you need but also combine the winds aloft and your airspeed to get your estimated groundspeed.

On most airplanes its generally the left engine due to the asymmetrical thrust provided by the rotation of the propellers.gt What factors go into determining a critical engine?Pfactor from the rotation of the propellers.Accelerated slipstreamSpiraling slipstreamTorque effect.gt What is Vmc and what things affect it and how?Vmc is the minimum airspeed needed to maintain control of a multiengine airplane in the event of an engine failure. Going below Vmc can result in a loss of control. Vmc can vary based on the configuration of the aircraft and is different for every flight. Thing that affect Vmc Location of CG  A forward CG lowers Vmc an aft CG raises Vmc. Landing Gear  Down lowers Vmc up raises Vmc. Flaps  Down lowers Vmc up raises Vmc. Weight  Higher weight lowers Vmc light weight raises Vmc. Dead engine feathered  Feathered will lower Vmc Power setting on the good engine  Higher power setting raises Vmc lower power setting lowers Vmc. Up to  degrees of bank  Adding bank into the good engine will lower Vmc.gt Under what conditions is an aircrafts Vmc certified?Standard temperature and atmosphere at sea level.Maximum power on the good engine.Aft CG.Critical engine is dead and windmilling.FlapsGear down.Up to  degrees of bank into the good engine.Most unfavorable weight.gt What is the advantage of counterrotating propellers?No critical engine.

You should be pitching for blue line pretty much any time you lose your engine. In light twins it wont guarantee a climb but itll give you the slowest decent. If it does give a climb more altitude never hurt when trying to get back to an airport.

7107388,0,t3_4cungm,I am just finishing my CPL training having started it last week. I have been doing alot of flying in a Cessna  and its been years since I flew a single engine Cessna so I was extremely rusty and awful with coordination. For me the eights on pylons were super easy as were accelerated stalls steep spirals and steep turns. But it took  full days of flying to get the chandelle lazy eights and poweroff . For the chandelle and lazy eight I couldnt grasp just how slow and gradual everything is. Coming from flying twins I felt extremely uncomfortable flying so slow well within  mph of stall and in those maneuvers not only are you flying near stall speed but you are in a turn while you are doing it. All of the alarms were going off in my head saying This is wrong this is wrong this is wrong... but thats exactly it  you need to stay coordinated and be comfortable right on the edge of stalling. This was particularly difficult for me because I am a wimp when it comes to stalls I put the plane in a spin on a power on stall on my second flying lesson ever and have since been paranoid. Halfway through your first lazy eight at the  degree point you are juuuuust starting to move away from stall speed having lowered the nose and you are in a  degree bank so the airplane feels like it is almost falling sideways I should note I am getting my CPLMulti first and then adding on the SEL rating so I am doing all my maneuvers in a relatively underpowered Cessna  which is also a new and uncomfortable feeling. My other problem was that I could never think of a reason where I would roll out of a  degree bank in such a slow fashion. I mean really slow. The poweroff  took time solely because I needed to brush off my landing skills in general and remember how much these planes float. This maneuver also requires plain practice. The more you try it the more you learn when you are too far and when you are too close to make your base turn. You also learn the little tricks of your airplane ie if you are a bit low on short final in a C add  degree of flaps to give you an extra few seconds of bonus lift to make your target.I apologize for the poor sentence structures and runons in this write up but I am in a hurry. Hope this helps!EDIT Just wanted to add  more things that helped after you have been introduced to the maneuvers and have tried them go back and learn a what the objective of the maneuver is and b the PTS for that maneuver. It will make much more sense and if you know why you are doing what you are doing you will be able to see the bigger picture.I also found that talking myself through the maneuver while I was doing it really helped. That was when it finally clicked for me. ,flying,d1lzxjc,3,t5_2qm1t

Youve got jet IFR arrivals into OAK above youve got the SJC class C and the OAK class C right next to you youre under the SFO Class B youre close to LVK Class D traffic and sometimes people extend out towards KTCY traffic as well. I wouldnt call a practice area a safe area by any means.

The safest thing to do is continue on the route. We know exactly where youre going to go and where to keep planes away from. When you start descending and turning we dont know where youre going thus we dont know who to bail out of your way. Im not saying youre wrong. Just playing devils advocate and giving you our side of the radio. Come hang out at a facility for an afternoon and see what really goes on and how fast things develop.

7176638,0,t1_d1ta4vx,Ive flown about  miles from a  thunderstorm as it was shitting its load over Las Vegas NM.  I was getting my instrument and we were near TAFOY if I remember right.  Everything in that Cessna  hit the roof or the shoulder straps then hit the floor seats or glare shield.  All this happened in just a second and we were  feet lower than before that hit us.  Severe turb isnt a joke.Another time I was stuck on the approaching side of a squall line.  I was between Jackson and Meridian MS.  The storm was moving SW and I was headed NW.  I was getting rocked non stop even though I was easily  miles from the rainfall.  I kept pushing looking for an airport so I could wait out the storm.  Right below me appeared Kosciusko MS seemingly out of nowhere and I didnt give it two thoughts about private runway this or that.  I landed and that was it.  The guys there helped me into a hangar and we all waited out this big bastard in peace.  Thunderstorm turb is no joke either.One guy on here posted pics of the king air he was flying after it went through what sounded like a mountain wave rotor.  His photos showed extensive damage to the fuse and wings in the form of rivet heads popped off and wrinkled sheet metal.  I dont remember all the details but it sure didnt look like a fun day.  Mountainwind turbulence is no friggin joke.Like Baystate said.. if there are severe turb reports Id rely on them.  Ive flown right past severe pireps and got almost nothing but that was storm related and the storm had moved by the time I was there.  Wind and mountain related like what you described around JLI doesnt really quit until the wind stops.  It could create a downdraft and pull you right into a mountain side or jack you and your plane up real bad too.Sorry to go on and on but I have flown through a lot of turbulence.,flying,d1tx2ak,2,t5_2qm1t

I actually did my first landing today that put a nice big smile on my face. There isnt that much studying during flight training. I will usually review what we went over right after the lesson and then read the necessary chapters in my FTM Flight Training Manual the night before my next lesson. There is a required  hour ground school component for a PPL which I assume will require more studying. I will be doing my ground school once I turn  and get a drivers license so I can go to the airport by myself. I am from Canada so our licensingtraining system is a bit different but I believe most requirements are quite similar if youre in the US.

7558236,0,t3_4iv14n,I graduated from a  year university with a  program last year and have been working as a CFI with the same school since. If you want to make aviation a career keep in mind the requirements for the RATP.If you are unaware the ATP is required if you want to start flying some large aircraft e.g. at the airlines level and has a requirement of  total hours. The FAA has instituted the RATP which allows you apply for the certificate at lower hours if you received your training through certain flight schools or through the military.Long story short If you plan on going to a university type program for a degree in aviation keep in mind that coming in with more ratings done can make it harder to meet the credit hour requirements of the RATP. Universities award credit hours for the flight lessons taken for each certificaterating but cannot count those credit hours towards the RATP as they were not done with their FAAapproved curriculum.My advice? If you can afford and have the time to complete your PPL before you join the flight school you might be able to save yourself some time and money. But I would not go any further nor would I start PPL training if I didnt think I could finish it seeing as different flight schools would not be able to take  of the hours in your logbook towards their courses.Message me if you have any other questions!,flying,d31c2j0,3,t5_2qm1t
7558745,0,t3_4ipn9c,My approach depends whether isolated pop up tstorms are expected without organization or whether organized convection squall lines other mesoscale convective systems is expected.On days where the air mass is susceptible to afternoon pop up convection get your trip started early in the day.  I fly IFR at an altitude where I am above any baseline cumulus above the haze layer.  This can be as low as  feet sometimes as high as  feet.  I carry oxygen on long XC.  Then you just request deviations around any towering cumulus.  You can spot them a long way off even before they become precip generating and show up on RADAR and usually only a few minor deviations are required.  ADSB weather gives you the bigger picture and instructions which way to divert.  But you want to maintain VMC as much as possible its really bumpy in those clouds anyway.Organized convection is another ballgame.  You need to be very familiar with forecast tools to give an idea of what is possible and at what time.  Organized convection can block an area of hundreds of miles.  On a long enough trip you may have the opportunity to shift a mid way fuel stop left or right of the direct course by hundreds of miles while adding only an hour or less of air time to avoid weather.  But on some trips a line of storms may block off enough airspace to make driving the better option.  You might still be able to avoid dangerous conditions by departing early or after the line has passed.  Its NEVER appropriate to pick your way through organized convection with nonrealtime RADAR information.In both cases adjust your trip fuel accordingly.  Dont be afraid to divert or change the plan but always have a current plan.Oh and if the forecast is for embedded convective activity Im grounded.  Gotta be able to see those TCUCBs.,flying,d31e5it,2,t5_2qm1t

Experience is important because it is a massive part of how we learn. I have sat through many many ground loops that I allowed students to go through so they could experience it in a controlled situation obviously not at the speeds this video occurred at!. Ive also witnessed first hand a tailwheel aeroplane entering a ground loop and adding power and saw the devastating results an airframe writeoff.If you want to know where I disagree with your interpretation of events then I have added my notes below?gt . Plane makes unstable approach in cross windsOn this we agree! though how much cross there is I do not knowgt Plane makes a decent flair considering the approach and touches down right wheel firstHis touch down is poor. He is neither wheeling with a good check forward to hold the aircraft on the mains or  pointing he is caught half way between and ends up in a tail oscillation. This is what I was talking about earlier with regard to the pilot letting the aeroplane fly itself and he just being along for the ride.gt Plane bounces a few times before the right wing rises dramaticallyThe plane is bouncing because of the poor landing the starboard wing goes up as the aircraft enters a ground loop. Presumably the wind is also now getting under the starboard wing exacerbating the issue.gt gt Student goes full throttleThe wrong option because he is not in control of the aircraft and the aeroplane is already in a dangerous attitude. To add power to this situation is to invite greater consequence.gt Left wing bounces off the groundBecause it is ground looping. gt Plane lifts off in a nose slightly but not dangerously high left wing low attitudeBut still out of control.gt Plane enters stable left turning flight and student begins to roll it back to levelHow you think that anything that was happening was stable I have no idea.gt Instructor pulls power to idle causing the plane to sink dramatically and the left wing to drop againThe instructor took the power out of the situation in order to help it come to an end. It resulted in the best possible outcome. The aircraft came to a rest on its gear without any further impacts with the ground.gt Plane impacts the ground off the runway and ground loopsThis aeroplane has been ground looping for quite some time at this point.,flying,d382o8j,1,t5_2qm1t

7994275,0,t1_d4eidqm,No doubt its serious. Just now getting into instrument stuff most of it in a full motion FTD and that shit had me pretty fucked up a few times. Definitely good to see how those situations unfold and how quickly they can go wrong without having to worry about the consequences in a sense. Personally I feel that everyone should get a few hours in a full motion FTD in complete IMC early in their instrument training I know that I learned a lot from it. Planning on knocking out all of my sim time allowed for my commercial in IMC shooting approaches holds etc. I know its not the same as being in an actual aircraft but for running procedures I dont know of any better method. Having the ability to pause it is great too. Being able to take a moment to really walk through an approach or ask a question to the instructor and get a good explanation is great and definitely much harder to do in an airplane. Its just a matter of speeding up that thought process to being ready for actual instrument flying and relying less and less on the pause feature really helps with with that. I also like being able to look back at the track log at the end of the flight. Its definitely cool to compare the holds I was flying when I started compared to my last hour I worked on it in the sim. I think its a great training tool and it runs hour with an instructor so its a no brainer when building time towards commercial. ,flying,d4ems2j,2,t5_2qm1t

In fact I pity those living in the suburbs and exurbs that fight traffic day in and day out to get to a Publix. South Tampa is a wonderful area for both young people Howard Ave upscale Hyde Park obscenely wealthy Bayshore and middle class other areas of South Tampa.Downtown is in the midst of a revitalization. I live in Channelside which is a fantastic urban community with the ability to walk to hockey games dozens of times per year concerts events at the Channelside Plaza near the Riverwalk giving access to the numerous parks including the flagship Curtis Hixon park and the newly opened Water Works Park and some great bars and restaurants. Jeff Vinik a former hedge fund manager and current owner of the Lightning together with Bill Gates investment arm control  acres of land downtown and are right in the midst of an entire redevelopment of the area around the Amalie Arena and roadwork should begin this year. We have several new high rises going up at this moment and just this week new plans of redevelopment of riverfront land in Tampa Heights was just unveiled. Ybor City remains a gem of Tampa for its entertainment nightlife cigar bars and more.With Uber and Lyft plus other options Zipcar just launched the Streetcar is an option and more we have easy access to Raymond James Stadium for Buccaneers games and other activities Westshore for two great malls Hard Rock Casino and the Florida State Fairgrounds.

8153639,0,t3_4qx16z,I just want to pop in because the whole hours to solo thing gets used competitively and it shouldnt.  I used to see people at the school comparing their solo hours and its complete and utter bullshit it is not some report card.  Truth be told when I soloed my first student he was probably a little over prepared but I was nervous...thats on me.  Outside of that I have seen people solo at  hours who couldnt fly their self out of a wet paper bag.  Indeed some of those low hr solos who bragged about it were some of the worst pilotsnot worst students thats an entirely different thing Ive flown with.  Of course I also had low hr solos who were great pilots as well too.Fact of the matter is just because one pilot soloed earlier than another pilot is not a fair comparison.  Example I had one student whose roommate was a CSEL student building hours this guy flew with me twice a day and with his roommate about every day.  He soloed around .  Another student soloed late around  because his schedule was rough and hed get close then take a long break in between so wed have to do retraining.  Also learning the basics to allow an early solo does not mean that later concepts will be grasped with the same relative ease.  Ive had students who were late solos and early solos who started about the same time finish within a very similar time frame because the guy who soloed earlier struggled later in the curriculum whereas the guy who struggled early excelled later.If you have a concern though talk to your CFI it might be beneficial to go with another CFI too.  But just dont put too much emphasis on the solo time as a report card it isnt a good one.,flying,d4wr3n2,15,t5_2qm1t

8747296,0,t1_d6yyr3d,Youve touched on one of my greatest failings. Its a human factors problem that I am actively working on for flying but also in my personal and professional life. Quite frankly I dont react well when situations evolve outside of the plan. I tend to get emotional far less rational and I lose sight of the immediate objective. Im working on it and Ive gotten better about it but being in Atlanta potentially gumming up the works hit one of my personal pet peeves. I cant stand when my actions or inactions negatively impact others. In my mind the thought of me being the cause of a delayed flight full of paying passengers and an enormous amount of Jet A wasting away was too much. I needed to be out of that situation as quickly as I could. The quickest way would likely have been exactly as you described but Im clearly not yet there in fixing this problem I have. Its definitely something that I think about especially in the context of hypothetically declaring an emergency and causing all kinds of problems for the system. Its the right thing to do in that situation but I need to learn to deal with it instead of having it add to my stress level.,flying,d6z2egr,14,t5_2qm1t

Consequently approach slope indicator systemsare related to the EWH for the aircraft that the aerodrome isintended to serve and they provide safe wheel clearance overthe threshold when the pilot is receiving the onslope indication.gtPilots andor air operators must ensure that the VASIS type to beused is appropriate to the given aircraft type based on the EWHfor that aircraft.

If youre a flight school taking people on an Ab initio ATPL course you would normally teach a  degree glide slope from the start.The idea is that students on the course only fly around  hours of VFR followed by about  hours of IFR. That completes their CPL and IR skills tests and they then move on to a  or A sim for an MCC course. In Europe and possibly Asia thats enough for a FO position on a  or A.Since theyll then be flying  degree GSs in jets for the rest of their careers it makes sense to teach that as standard from the very beginning.

The regulation says   or  from the indicated bearing it never says to or from the station. A  degree deviation is going to be what you get whether its indicating to or from for example. The reason its preferable to use FROM is that a lot of airborne checkpoints and ground VOR checkpoints list the radial from the station you could take the reciprocal and it would work the same. In addition when listing the bearing error in the log as required it makes it easier to just say  and know people used FROM otherwise it would be  for a TO indication.,flying,d80pkl2,6,t5_2qm1t

9077211,0,t3_54l4he,I second KLUK! Its a fantastic old airport. It has fantastic tower controllers.  Very friendly and accommodating. Make sure you use your EFB for taxi and mapping as their taxiways can be a bit confusing from the ground. Watch for a sudden change in wind speed and direction on short final as it has caught me offguard sometimes. Pay particular attention to hold short markings when taxiing and pay careful attention to taxi instructions. Its very easy to accidentally cross an active runway at this airport. You will also find out why they call it sunken lunken.  It literally sits in a hole. Make sure that you coordinate class B flight following with Cincinnati and lunken tower. Cincinnati is very accommodating with flight following and never says no to VFR pilots. When you depart careful not to climb too high before getting that magical phrase to clear you into the class B airspace. After you land just tell the controllers that you want to park next to the restaurant. Its inside the old terminal building. Theres a small GA parking area right in front of it that you will see. Its free to park.  There is a locked gate between the airfield in the old terminal building that you will need to go through to get to the restaurant. When you leave and come back to your aircraft just press the buzzer and tell them your tail number. They will buzz you back in. Fair warning though the restaurant can get kind of busy during weekday lunch. You could have up to a  minute wait for a table. The service isnt that speedy but the food is fantastic. I recommend the club sandwich! The old terminal building is built in the early th century art deco style. Its beautiful! Its about a  to  minute wait for an Uber in that location if you need to go anywhere in town also. It is also the original home to Aeronca aircraft company and American Airlines. The Beatles and Charles Lindbergh landed here ! This airport is extremely rich in history. Make sure you check out the lobby and all the historical photographs from the airport.  This place is a Gem!On a sidenote if you landed KLEX instead. You will definitely be taking an Uber or a courtesy car from Tacair. There is nothing within a couple miles of that airport. Oh yeah I almost forgot. When you park at the GA parking check out the aircraft thatsays flamingo air on the side. They do romantic sightseeing trips for couples. And theres a bed in the back of the airplane with a curtain between the pilot in the bed. Im not joking!

9294204,0,t3_57q8ix,I dont know the exact differences between Airbus and Boeings philosophy as I only have flying experience on the . But from what I can tell Airbus focuses more on assisting the pilot with controlling and operating the aircraft with the use of computers. Ultimately putting more faith if you will in the computers than in the pilots. Whereas Boeing is a little oldschool and doesnt have the flybywire system Airbus uses on their models. The pilot always has the last say on what the aircraft does unless the aircraft really wants to do something else .As for the video it was HARD to watch. Neither pilot knew what he was doing. Especially the guy on the right who should be knowing what he was doing. Probably shouldve put someone beside a firsttimer capable of operating a B. Autothrottle after take off? While flying manual? I understand that its the guys first time flying the B and introducing AT will help reduce the workload but this will lead to controlling difficulties as the AT will always lag behind in relation to speedpitch changes.

In short if the pilot knowssuspectsshouldknow that he needs O he should use it.  If he knows that he does not need it then it is not required.  There are several ways to determine whether you need supplemental O a pulseoximeter selfobservation.  Many people for example smokers need O well below  and if theyre pilots theyre obligated to be aware of that need and use it.  The FAR are a very poor way to determine whether you need to use O because individual physiology varies widely and the FARs are very permissive wrt O.I only fly gliders.

Calculating the wind corrections to ensure we hit the point in the ballpark calculate our ETEETA and fuel burn and plot WampB changes that matter for our destination. Youre a student. Using a GPS for everything this early robs you of essential experience and valuable skill development. Know how to use the GPS which it sounds like you do but stop using for your XC navigation. Stick with paper for now. Youll have plenty of time in later training and work to use other navigation systems but having respected and working hard with the paper method will make you a much more solid navigator. There will be times in your career where either the GPS will fail you or the aircraft wont even have one. Aviate Navigate Communicate.One example I have experienced first hand pulling out a chart and plotting a course with a pencil to get somewhere while in the aircraft thanks to data not updating with the GPS system with paying customers waiting.

Depending on the country the contracts go to a number of different air charter companies. Theres everything from Cessna s to s. Some are good others.... not so much. Im not sure what standard the WFP uses for the contracts WFP manages the UNHAS in most places but it certainly isnt a USAW. Europe standard. So youd have to apply to and work for the contractor not the UN itself.For HELO operations it seems you always get crazy Ukranian pilots in a collection of Russian design helos. Lots of Mis and such. I suspect it is something that Ukraine and Russia offer as part of their contributions to their UN obligations.

If he waited more time to cancel wouldnt you just have received vectors to re intercept the approach? And wouldnt that have allowed you to actually fly it instead of sorta staying VFR sorta diving to MDA in a panic to capture it? I wouldnt rush a pilot into the cancelation especially after he responded to the call on Unicom.

As we descended I started getting pain in my ears and it only got worse the further down we went.  It was really bad and eventually I was effectively deaf as I couldnt hear a thing.  I couldnt understand what anyone was saying.  I just had to go through the normal motions of deplaning and thank the gods there was nothing special about it otherwise I would not have known what was going on.  I had thought about bringing it up with a flight attendant but I was only imagining the look on their face as I am explaining this weird situation.  I go inside the airport and just had to relax as I slowly became adjusted to the pressure.  I do not recall any sudden pop just a slow progress of being accustomed to ground pressure and I was able to hear again and the pain subsiding.

10292009,0,t1_dcajebt,How recoverable are those issues?To my mind the difference between a forgiving plane and a death trap is how difficult it is to recover from the most common mistakes. E.g. a common mistakes in fixed wing aircraft is stalling. A typical trainer can be stalled intentionally and will recover without losing much altitude often without much more skill than it takes to release the stick.  A few designs have a reputation more on the death trap end of the spectrum because they are difficult to recover from a stall. A great example is your typical canard design. In normal flight it is very hard to stall a canard design much harder than the conventional layout...but once you manage the feat it may be impossible to recover. The fact that it is harder to stall should make it safer but the fact that it may be impossible to recover once you do stall colors perception. ,flying,dcanl8a,3,t5_2qm1t

Hes had a ton of students start and flake never finishing.He figures hes doing them a favor by not having them spend big  if they arent committed. My CFI also feels more comfortable signing a solo endorsement if the written is passed as it gives him third party verification that the student knows the basic theories. ,flying,dd7hwnw,1,t5_2qm1t

10588003,0,t3_5rflxy,So...this is just me being me so feel free to ignore. Do all the flight planning in FFSkyVectorwhatever if youd like. But I would transcribe it to an old fashioned nav log and chart and bring that with. Be honest and tell him that you used FF or SkyVector to help you plan and QA your results. Make sure you can explain how you got the numbers that are on your log. Youll look like a dunce if he asks you how you calculated magnetic from true and you blank. Same goes for performance data calculationmake sure you can talk your way through the performance charts even if you used an electronic aid in your preflight planning.Im a big fan of always using all the tools you have at your disposal BUT always be prepared for them to failand on a checkride fail they will. Bring the log and chart with you in the airplane so that when the DPE says simulated and takes away your iPad you have your charts and log ready to go. If youre doing an IR check bring a hard copy of the AFD or IFR SUPP and approach plates with you. Paper never fails. Prefold your charts dogear AFD and approach plate pages attach your log to your kneeboard etc . If youre not cheatin youre not tryin.As for stuff you would check on the ground WXNOTAMS FARAIM etc by all means go electronic. But...know the phone numbers you would call and which hard copies you would reference should the internet go down If you approach it as tech being supplemental and not a replacement youll have the right mindset.Edit I had a particularly old DPE for my PPL check. It was years ago and I cant remember exactly what I did but I remember him saying look at that doing it the old fashioned way! and he seemed to eat it up. Certainly not saying the old way is always better but knowing your audience can help you score some points ,flying,dd82ksj,1,t5_2qm1t

In the  I was flying  or  feet is the highest I was able to go given the temperature and weight of my aircraft and that I had no oxygen onboard. The reason I followed the highways was because the front ranges of the Rockies are quite a bit higher than that altitude Mount Assiniboine is over  feet. If the winds are reasonably high a mountain wave can occur which acts like water flowing over rocks in a stream updrafts and downdrafts around the mountains. This can cause serious altitude loss and so travelling in the valley is usually easier. Its also easier to navigate visually especially if youre familiar with the area. ,flying,ddeb1sf,5,t5_2qm1t

In Europe many people like to gopro their circuits and often you can find someone flying it on video  which really helps. If you use something like easyvfr or skydemon you can overlay your approach on the bigger map helping you to find markers and reference.Most importantly if you cant find something or youre not sure ask ATC or tower. They are very helpful and want you to find the field also. Calling your destination airport in advance and asking for some pointers also might help  they can give you references less easy to find on maps or AIPs.

10877529,0,t3_5vgioj,gt I would think that a more logical missed approach would either a set you up efficiently for a second try or b send you off towards a nearby alternate with a hold along the way. What am I missing here?The way it was explained to me the piece of the puzzle youre missing is the  other aircraft lined up behind you to shoot approaches into Atlanta and the dozen or so trying to get into other nearby airports or simply move through the airspace. In other words All the other crap on the controllers scope that we cant see in the cockpit.When you go missed youre flying low slow and youre potentially in the way of a bunch of other people. ATC needs to get you UP away from things on the ground that you can hit at a reasonable speed and out of everyone elses way so youre not mucking up the flow from the rest of the national airspace system but in particular the arrivals and departures at the airport you were trying to get into.Missed approach procedures do that very well and they help satisfy the Safe and Orderly parts of ATCs mandate They climb you and get you out of everyone elses way while ATC figures out how best to sequence you back into the traffic flow. A side effect of that is youre usually sent out to the relative middle of nowhere but once youre at the missed approach point you can shed workload ask ATC for longer legs etc. while you get set up to shoot the approach again. If the minute legs are a bit short you can always request longer legs from ATC or ask for vectors back onto the approach once youre at the MAP.  Even though its in the relative middle of nowhere the missed approach point is usually selected to be relatively convenient for getting back onto the approach in the case of the ILS RWY  at KMVY the controller can kick you out of the hold inbound to ACK and you just fly the approach from there.Of course if there arent  other people behind you and a mess of other aircraft buzzing around the airspace ATC probably wont make you fly the published miss to the middle of nowhere If possible theyll vector you right back onto the approach for another try because it makes everyones life easier. Thats the Expedient part of the ATC mantra but it always comes after the other two.,flying,de1xua9,10,t5_2qm1t

10919311,0,t3_5vzwdq,I just started using MyFlightBook and I like it a lot. Itll autodetect the model of aircraft based off the tail number if another pilot has logged it on the same program it shows different airports youve been to and breaks down your different types of flight time. Itll also track your progression towards a certificate or rating. Like I said I just started using it but from what I can see so far its very nice and free. The only downside so far is that visually is isnt as appealing or simple as others but thats a small complaint.Ive also used Foreflights logbook and that is good as well and has a lot of the same features just not some of the novelty ones that MyFlightBook has like tracking how many times youve been to airport xyz. My complaint about Foreflight is that it doesnt seem to transfer as well to other programs from what I can tell. Thats why I have  formats. Paper foreflight and myflightbook. It might be overkill but you can never have too many backups and programs checking your math. ,flying,de690ev,8,t5_2qm1t

10924944,0,t1_de6qlm9,You just said you dont care how you get to be a pilot you get to be a pilot.You go into the military commissioned you get better pay than a regional airliner starting out you get health insurance housing food and your education loans will be paid for. That will easily eliminate k from your fixed monthly costs. Its ten years yeah thats a long time and a big commitment. But you also are getting yearly bonuses which if you put them away you will have your kids college paid for. This is all free no loans no ATP straight to the big toys after flight training.On top of that you will get out roughly at  years old. If you push yourself and really commit to flying you can fly something like a KC and have thousands of hours as PIC and any major carrier will pick you up before you even receive your DD retirement papers. So youre  and youll be able to fly well into your s and you will start out on bigger passenger jets making lots of money and have the choice to fly wherever and whenever you want mainly. Its just a better bet than regionals IMO and if you dont commit to the military it looks like youre going to have to commit to the bank loans for a much longer time probably.,flying,de6tyca,4,t5_2qm1t
10925183,0,t3_5w14au,If youre going to go for it avoid ATP. You can get it all done PPLCFI in close to the same amount of time at a mom and pop shop. Find a place that has a large fleet and maintenance. Do not shell out the extra money for a G equipped airplane no one cares about G time. I did all my training in just under a year for k all while working a full time job. It is my understanding that you will not be able to work while going to ATP. CFIs are in such high demand right now that the school you learned at will probably hire you. Now onto pay. As a CFI it varies quite a bit Ive seen on the low end  to  or even more if youre a specialty instructor. Low time pilot jobs below TT are out there if instructing isnt for you. You can get on with a part  operator as a First Officer which pays about k. At some places Boutique Air for example will upgrade you pretty much right as you hit the part  PIC mins TT. A captain there pays k. There are other part s out there I just used them as an example. Now lets say youve hit TT and go to a regional. This is where it depends on what is more important to you right now. Quality of Life? Pay? Domicile? etc. Some regionals have hefty signing bonuses and retention bonuses but keep in mind its only a bonus and that can end at anytime. You can make between kk at a regional first year without and bonuses. It only goes up from there. Depending on what regional you go to you can upgrade in a little over a year to  I think thats what ExpressJet is at. Mind you you cannot upgrade until you have TT flying as a  FO. After you become a captain for a few years you might get picked up by a major. Pay at a major is where all the money is at as you already know.That is how pretty much everything is at this exact moment. This industry is ever changing and who knows what it will be  months from now or even a few years from now when you are trying to pick your regional.,flying,de6uu8q,2,t5_2qm1t

11158384,0,t3_5z4j2b,This is from a while back in my flight training from my first night flight. Nothing bad ended up coming from it but thankfully I learned some valuable lessons.Initially I found I was pretty tired and out of focus so that was already a human factors strike against me to go flying but I decided that Id tough it out and just fly since I was going to be with a CFI and it was a flight I really needed to get out of the way.Noticed pretty early on in the briefing that it was likely going to be a rough one I was forgetting things I shouldnt have forgotten and just being slow overall. Got out to the airplane started up and was once again slow to get off the line. Then instead of taking a crosswind takeoff on the closer runway which is what I probably shouldve done they asked if I wanted an intersection departure from a runway Id never actually been on which I ended up accepting.I even forgot to take my taxi diagram out along the way and was basically just feeling my way around thinking for some reason that I knew the taxiways well enough.Eventually got to the runway just fine but started turning onto the runway opposite of the one I was supposed to actually depart from right instead of left off the taxi.

Read them while constructing lesson plans of your own.  When youre done youll know the material backwards and forwards.  You can buy lesson plans but then you have to learn how that person teachesand that seems too hard at least to me.  If you make your own you can craft them to suit your style.

11292007,0,t3_615nzo,If you have  amps for  minutes Im gonna go out on a limb and guess that you have a  amphour battery. Regulations require that following a loss of electrical generation by the way Im not familiar with the DA but Im gonna guess its an alternator not a generator that a backup source power essential items NOT the entire electrical system for  minutes. So what Id glean from that statement is you have a  amphour battery and theyve decided that a  amp load is what youll get with nonessential items shed. To use completely made up numbers say your beacon strobe and nav lights are  amps one navcomm radio is  amps your cockpit lights are  amps and the engine instruments are  amps and thats all thats installed on the electrical system. Youre flying along and the alternator dies. Youre using  amps. For a  amphour battery itll last . hours or  minutes. Now that doesnt get you to  minutes like the FAA requires. So diamond would say well if you suffer an alternator failure youd load shed nonessential items like basic exterior lights. So you shut those off and youre down to  amps so that  amphour battery will now last the requisite  minutes. Edit went and found a DA POH online. The relevant paragraphgt There is  minutes of battery power at a discharge load of amperes when the battery is fully charged and properlymaintained.Also they do call it a generator.

11338021,0,t1_dfgq42m,You were doing so well explaining things and then you got a bit in over your head.Nonhomic materials are a thing.  These are materials that respond to applied voltage with a nonlinear resistance response.  There can be many explanations.  Many materials conductivity changes as it is ionized or as it heats up.  Inductance throws a huge wrench at simple ohmic relationships for inductive loads like motors.  To  be fair VIR is never broken in any of these materials but changing V will cause a nonlinear change in I because the R will also change.  You cant even take something as simple as a light bulb and say that if I apply v to this lightbulb and get amp I must get amp if I apply v.  The filament assuming it doesnt burn up will change resistance in response to v and yield a different resistance than it did at v applied.The reality is no are nearly no materials are truly ohmic over large ranges of voltage.  Early physics classes assume materials are ohmic for the same reason every surface is frictionless and air resistance is ignored.  It simplifies things and focuses on the core problem statement.  In reality nothing is ohmic not a light bulb not your skin not even a resistor on a circuit board.  To ignore that is wrong even if youre beating a drum that is totally right that the amps vs volts argument is dumb they are related,flying,dfh58af,1,t5_2qm1t

11370397,0,t1_dfkdckc,And Ill to try to explain all this once more as simply as possible then move on with my life.Im going to start with things that can be observed directly because you seem to want proof and then move to ideas that youre having some trouble understanding. I wont even use terms like gravity and such.Planes do not need to compensate for curvature. And its not because the earth is flat. Can we agree that forward motion of an object through the air  a downward pulling force on the object will equal a curved flight path?  You say you want proof of all this  Ok go outside right now pick up a rock throw it and observe.  It travels a curved path because you propelled it through the air with forward motion and there is also a downward force acting on it.  I dont care what you call the downward force but you can observe that there is one if you simply drop the rock from shoulder height.  It moves straight down toward the surface of the Earth.  DONt jump to wingsengines etc. yet. All objects moving through the air experience drag.  For the samesized thing moving through the air the drag increases as speed increases.  Get in a car and stick your hand out the window.  Does the air push against your hand harder at mph than at mph?  You can observe this.  You probably have observed this.  You might also have observed that if you tip the forwardleading edge of your hand upward you get a nice upward push on your hand.  It tries to climb away from the earth perpendicular to the slipstream.  Lets say were starting to get clever and decide that we want to find a way to put a pretty large heavy object into the air and keep it there.  If we just lift it and drop it all it does is fall straight down.  That wont work.  OK lets accelerate it like we did that rock.  Thats better it travels for a little distance in sort of a curved path over the earth  but then it falls again.  Well fuck.  Now what?  I guess we have to ask why it fell.  Refer back to .The observable things we have already covered tell us that it fell because there is a force pulling it downward we saw that happen. They also tell us that the damned thing keeps slowing down no matter how hard we hurl it that wind resistance we felt earlier is being a pain in the ass.We decide to tackle this one step at a time.  Clearly weve noticed birds flying so we take a good look at the way their wings are shaped in flight and build fairly good nonflapping replicas of those wings.  We strap them to our object which weve now streamlined like the body of a bird.  Cant hurt right?  We even tilt the leading edge of the wings up just a bit so well get some of the upward push we felt when we tilted a hand up in the car slipstream. Thatll help too.  We hurl our object again.  Way better!  The wings worked!  The streamlining worked.  The thing glided like a bird for a much further distance than before when we just threw it.  But it still traveled in a long curved arc and fell back the ground.  Dammit!  The wings worked.  They countered that downward pulling force.  We decide to call what weve discovered lift. But the wings need air flowing over them a a certain speed to generate that lift.  The damned air drag from  must be slowing the object down in flight. Proof  Go to the Dollar Store and buy yourself a cent balsa glider.  Launch the fuselage without wings attached.  Launch it again fully assembled and correctlybalanced.  I think you know what happens already.Alright.  We have the lift thing licked.  Weve built a few more wings and perfected the design as much as possible.  But we still cant glide for long periods without this contraption returning to Earth when we dont want it to.  So we go back to our observations and study .  Idea  Lets mount an engine on this thing with a big fan or something that will make some thrust to overcome all that air drag that keeps getting in the way.After some experimentation some trial and error and after inadvertently reducing the height of a corn field and scaring the shit out of the neighbors dog we finally find a very lightweight engine that we can strap a good sized propeller to.  All our experimenting has told us that this prop creates a hell of a pushing force.  Probably enough to overcome that drag and keep our object aloft.So we mount it up.  Fire up the engine and leave it at idle for now.  Hurl the contraption.  It glides as before but when it starts to descend we hit the throttle on the engine and bring the prop up to speed.  Holy.  Fucking. SHIT! We stopped the descent.  We discover that if we slow the engine the airplane yeah thats what well call it!  descends.  If we speed up the engine the airplane climbs.  Proof  If youve ever ridden in an airplane youve heard the engines speed up during climb and slow to idle during descent.Back to our experiment Most importantly we discover that if we set the engine speed so the thrust neither makes the airplane climb or descend we can maintain that altitude until we run out of fuel.  We still cant finetune directional control or change the flight surfaces so that we can combine their effect with the engine thrust to fly any altitude we want but weve figured out that even with nonadjustable flight surfaces if we set the thrust to equal the drag at a speed where our nonadjustable wing makes lift that is equal to our weight then we can maintain an equilibrium and stay at a constant altitude above the earth.We didnt shut off that downward force we created a force equal to it.  We didnt eliminate the air drag we created a force equal to it.  We do some more observing and experimenting and discover that as we increase engine speedthrust the airplane now has more thrust than drag and the airplane will accelerate and then climb. Conversely if decrease engine speed the air drag cannot be overcome by the lower thrust and the airplane slows then descends.  We do all this without a moving tail surface.So we decide to add a moving tail surface why in hell didnt we do this before???.  Now we can tip the whole airplane and the wings mounted to it up and down by deflecting the tail surface.  This is most useful!  Now we can finetune the angle that the wings hit the oncoming air and effectively increase or decrease their lift.  When we do this while varying the engine thrust to overcome drag we can reach an equilibrium point at almost any altitude we want.  As long as we get everything equal where thrust equals drag and lift equals weight we can park the sumbitch at any level in the atmosphere at whatever airspeed is necessary for the equilibrium to occur.So  the most important thing to understand is that we need airspeed over the wings to maintain lift this is convenient because it means we are travelling forward and not just hovering and that we need the thrust to oppose air drag.  Drag hasnt disappeared.  The downward pulling force hasnt disappeared.  Both are still acting on the airplane the way they acted on the rock you threw way back at the beginning of the story weve just found a couple of clever ways to oppose their effect on our machine and maintain it in a temporary state of equilibrium in order to stay aloft at an altitude of our choosing.You say you dont buy or understand the orbit analogy.If we took that little rock from the beginning of the story the one we threw up into space lets say to  kilometers but didnt apply any forward motion and just dropped it it would still fall back to earth in a straight line just like it would if you stood up and dropped it from shoulder height.  The downward force that was present on the surface of Earth is still there in space.How did we keep the rock aloft before?  We threw it.  It still came back to earth but it traveled a good distance before it did.If we take the rock up to space at km again but this time we apply force to it and accelerate it to about  kilometers per hour weve done something very similar to throwing the rock while we were standing on Earths surface.  Only now theres no air drag to slow it down so itll continue at kph nearly forever.  At that speed it is still falling toward earth at the same rate it did when when we dropped it from km with no forward velocity only now at that altitude and velocity the curved surface of the earth is retreating away from the rock at a rate equal to the rocks rate of fall.  So at that velocity for every meter the rock travels downward toward the earth the earths curvature also bends bends away by one meter.  The rock falls toward the earth aimed at an impact point that is constantly projected past the true horizon by the extreme velocity.  The rocks path isnt parallel its following a curved flight path that matches the curvature of the earth in a state of equilibrium.When I fly a lb  at  feet and mph thrust is set to equal the air drag the airplane experiences.  Lift from the wings at that airspeed is equal to the lb weight imposed by the downwardacting force.  The airplane moves forward through the air at mph because mph is the speed where at ft  thrust equals drag and lift equals weight.Everything is in equilibrium at that speed and just like the rock satellite orbiting in equilibrium up there at km the airplane is now falling toward the earth at the same rate that the curvature is falling away.  The speeds are all dicked up and different from the orbital speeds in space because of all the clever shite weve done to temporarily outsmart the atmosphere but it works the same way.  No change in altitude on our part is necessary to follow curvature.  Our flight attitude is sightly noseup relative to the approaching horizon because thats the attitude the wings need to fly at to maintain lift equal to weight.,flying,dfkt9y0,2,t5_2qm1t

Even if it wasnt the prettiest landing you maintained positive control of the airplane and didnt panic or do something stupid on landing. Tires are easily replaceable.

Penalty for screwing up is high. Ive also caught a ride in a Pitts. That might give you some of the raging about the sky but also expensive. ,flying,dgu5dxy,2,t5_2qm1t

11798355,0,t3_68c5ka,I did mine in  days from first lesson to completion of the check ride . hours. That meant flying during the days studying nights and scheduling the check ride at the outset of my training.In order to finish the license within my time constraint I visited a couple local schools laid out my deadline committed to working at it all day every day and asked if and how they would help me accomplish my goal. The first school was friendly but didnt project a sense of professionalism or seem particularly invested in meeting my deadline. The second schools owner met me at the door talked with me about my goals acknowledged the timecrunch and then immediately introduced me to my instructor with whom I then drafted a plan of attack to get it all done in time. I flew my butt off in those  days but I loved it and it definitely pays to do your training quickly in order to stay sharp  the DPE remarked that I flew like a much highertime pilot at the end of the check flight. Your biggest limitations will be weather and getting your medical certificate so you can solo. Also recommend scheduling your check flight at the beginning of your training. ,flying,dgxdu6o,2,t5_2qm1t

11799186,0,t1_dgvd6rs,For sure.  I actually have an apartment right next to the Dino BBQ in Syracuse.  Be aware that during college graduation season the next month they are packed with hour or two wait on the weekends.  We fly out of B. They do a few pancake breakfasts in the summer.  We might have to head to WilliamsonSodus for the breakfast.  If you hear Skylane NCS thats us. ,flying,dgxh8d9,1,t5_2qm1t
11801261,0,t3_67x9fh, for flights. Had a pleasant experience with them. Plenty of planes and reasonable prices. Always availability with instructors and planes. Good people there too. You get a  per hour discount if youre a member so the membership pays for itself with  flights a month. Overall few complaints there.,flying,dgxppjr,1,t5_2qm1t
