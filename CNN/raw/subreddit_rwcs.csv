4892102,0,t1_cuauitd,This is an extremely thoughtful answer and one I completely agree with.  months ago I was in the exact same position as you. My gowipeonly friends clan started to talk down about my attacks as I was trying laloon and hogs and getting  or  stars while they consistently got . I ended up leaving the clan for a more likeminded one but not before trying the one  star attempt one gowipe method mentioned above. All in all finding a better clan was the best decision I ever made. I regularly  star high th now and I would not be doing so were I in my old clan. They are all still doing the same boring gowipe wars while I am more excited and happy with the game than ever. Once you get your first high level th  star going back to gowipe is terrible. Find a new clan. At the end of the day I guarantee it will improve your playing experience.,rwcs,cub6ss2,2,t5_396qp

4930104,0,t3_3ienip,Circlejerking aside... its because of the less volume of posts here rather than the metaposts in CoC. I think people just really dont want to post in this subreddit if it is not directly impacting RWCS but there are plenty of subs.,rwcs,cufz957,10,t5_396qp

6585320,0,t1_d004jld,Dont know the surrounding details of the attack but I think the biggest contributor to TH on TH fails is because THs often have to rush these attacks because theyre serving as emergency cleanup when THs fail to clear it themselves.,rwcs,d00h5ha,2,t5_396qp
