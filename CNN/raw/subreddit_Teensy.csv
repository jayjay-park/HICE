9245939,0,t1_d8nzax3,Yeah Ive seen that. Its a good start but quite outdated and it only shows how to set up individual buttons. Nothing about denouncing or setting up for loops to run through all the buttons or having these things run together without any issues. Im just new to all this and while I can copy code and hash things together I dont understand enough about whats happening underneath to make things work in the way it should.,Teensy,d8nznpq,1,t5_2sp1n
10717513,0,t3_5ta44o,my first guess would be some sort of connection issue maybe a short or maybe a loose connection. could also be simply a stuck keyswitch. have you opened up the keyboard and checked the wiring and switches?,Teensy,ddlfkac,2,t5_2sp1n
