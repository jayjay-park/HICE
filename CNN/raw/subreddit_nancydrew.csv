3636034,0,t3_31rdwk,Honestly I dont get how little  year olds can beat the games on their own. I always played with another person or asked my brothers or parents for help. You play other puzzle based games and yeah they can be tough but they have a logical system to things. If you beat one stage itll help you with the next. Nancy drew is just fucking anarchy.      I assume a lot of it comes from them being such a small company pumping out two games a year. They think yeah this makes sense easy. But if they got more opinions theyd realize it doesnt make any damn sense.,nancydrew,cq6qhdm,1,t5_2vd8h
5480283,0,t1_cw35lo7,I really liked Ghost Dogs everything flowed very logically. Same with the later Shadow at Waters Edge the theme was tied so well into the puzzles etc. I was often confused about what to do next in Blackmoor though hopefully the next game I play Message in a... is clearer. ,nancydrew,cwc5ohs,1,t5_2vd8h
5691898,0,t1_cx2hwyx,..... And what is mmos? Sorry Im not very video game savvy haha,nancydrew,cx2mvsp,3,t5_2vd8h
6241757,0,t1_cyytku2,Im totally with you there. The fact that their last message to us was in December I think is really scary to me. And the fact that it basically said We dont know anything at all. Just keep waiting. Thanks.,nancydrew,cyz4bqr,4,t5_2vd8h
6508835,0,t3_44ov15,Tiny and adorable! I never really considered how cool it would be to have actual copies of the books in the games. Theyre such a staple of the games that I dont think about them. Would love to see any more that you make! And definitely tweet it to HER or something. ,nancydrew,czskae1,2,t5_2vd8h
7681035,0,t3_4j6qge,What gets me about this whole thing is the lack of transparency. They kept telling us they dont have a set release date for MID with no reasoning. Why wouldnt they get their most loyal readybuilt audience excited about this new addition to their repertoire? Sure most of us arent their target audience since were a little older but Im positive many of the gamers have kids theyd love to pass a love of ND on to.    To me this was a very strange marketing decision. Left many of us feeling like HER just didnt care anymore and it makes me a little suspicious of their strategy overall.,nancydrew,d3facn1,1,t5_2vd8h
7688749,0,t3_4klcjk,Didnt happen to me but Ive started creating multiple files after each difficult puzzle so I can load that file and skip the puzzle when I replay haha. This could also help in case of glitches,nancydrew,d3g5ubh,1,t5_2vd8h
9281702,0,t3_57ewpa,Waters Edge is amazing but honestly I havent played the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon in such a long time I cant even remember who the villain even is. It was a lot of fun though. I liked the minigames. If I still had a PC Id definitely buy it.,nancydrew,d8sitw8,2,t5_2vd8h
9481906,0,t3_5ajoyf,I wish I had the self control to give up wondering about MID until Halloween . At least by then wed know SOMETHING. ,nancydrew,d9hulbu,5,t5_2vd8h
9951228,0,t1_db4btru,I mean they could have actually advertised. Most people I know dont even know the games exist. ,nancydrew,db4o5ov,11,t5_2vd8h
10040907,0,t3_5jh6ze,What did these emails ever say? I never saw them nor could anyone ever tell me exactly what they said. Anyone have any screen shots?,nancydrew,dbgcu87,2,t5_2vd8h
10099879,0,t1_dbmrt2w,I spoke to the person who created the game engine a while back. They told me they wouldnt be able to give me the tools HeR used. He was kind enough to to tell me about the Cheat Menu though. There is a set of HeR Tools online that a fan made that work for for some games but I think they are limited to viewing  files.   ,nancydrew,dbo10mx,1,t5_2vd8h
10134038,0,t1_dbs1950,They have been paying an outsourcing studio for everything. Im not sure what role the old game designer has had on MID. ,nancydrew,dbsgxjk,2,t5_2vd8h
10198781,0,t3_5m030l,To be honest I dont care if its real or not. HeR has brought this upon themself with the radio silence and condescending treatment of fans. Someone is bound to make up something to add to the drama sooner or later and Im going to enjoy it.,nancydrew,dc037bn,14,t5_2vd8h

11551592,0,t1_dg5clhi,The only reason I can think of is that theyre having financial problems.Maybe thats the reason for the constant sales on their games. Theyre hoping it can finance MID.,nancydrew,dg5dk0t,4,t5_2vd8h
11562093,0,t1_dg6jz4u,Hey! For now Im focusing on fan anecdotesbefore the disillusionment. But rest assured Im doing my due diligence and reaching out to HeR to hear their side of the story.,nancydrew,dg6kgdw,6,t5_2vd8h
11566235,0,t3_650vr3,Hey all Id like to clarify I hear your frustrations. I am not writing a puff piece. I am being a journalist and investigating matters. This requires I take a step back and put my biases aside to find out the facts.But I first and foremost want to tell your story and the story of a nearly twodecade long series that made such a difference to so many and provided such powerful experiences to an underserved audience. ,nancydrew,dg71doi,0,t5_2vd8h

11739462,0,t3_67i3lx,I... cant imagine playing games with a trackpad. I used a mouse and it worked just fine. Should be just as good or even better with a controller. A cheap wireless mouse should be easy to set up I dont use Macs so I dunno about your use case but I feel like it has to be? and will track just fine on the surface of a couch etc,nancydrew,dgqp4xs,7,t5_2vd8h
