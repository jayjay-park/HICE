1714737,0,t1_cjvaheh,No problem  Glad I could help. The Flathead Lake Bio Station  is really accurate with weather and temperature. It looks like the water temps were  today although keep in mind those vary quite a bit. Im not sure where those thermometers are kept as far as distance from shore. It can also get really windy out on the lake which can drop the wind chill quite a bit. As far as brain eating amoebas.... Um I dont think so? lol If you get the opportunity to extend your Glacier Nat Park stay do it. Its one of the coolest places to see in the state. We just gave our friends a quick  hour tour from West Glacier to Logan Pass on Going to the Sun Road  and I cant stress enough how much they missed out on. From someone who has gone to the park x a year since I was a kid some places you wont want to skip are Trail of the CedarsMcDonald LakeLodgeLogan PassSt. Mary LakeAvalanche Lake or Hidden LakeThe list goes on and on... But IMO those are some necessary highlights. Unfortunately it will probably take you two full days to see the majority of it. Also sorry for internet stock photos Im on my phone ampampamp cant pull up my own atm. Hope this helps! ,waterporn,cjvaz9b,5,t5_2sgw7

3007862,0,t1_co9r8pl,Yeah it was D.  Out of all the tours I did Id say the boat tour was my least favorite just because I didnt enjoy being nickled and dimed for everything.  I ended up NOT buying anything but it was very annoying to keep hearing you can do this amp that or buy this amp that but you have to pay extra... I wanted to strangle people.  Just shut up and let me enjoy the ride and scenery.,waterporn,co9rgfm,2,t5_2sgw7
3071199,0,t1_cog8jbz,I have pilot experience as well but no experience actually landing sea planes.  I have heard glassy smooth water is tough to land on because it becomes nearly invisible as it reflects the sky. On a lake you know the level of the water add you can see the shore but it is still tricky to know when to flare. No visible shore on the ocean so you have to guess when to flareand wait till you connect with the water. ,waterporn,cogbrtl,1,t5_2sgw7

6960252,0,t1_d159lri,That is the one!  I am actually really relieved its still standing after posting I thought to myself that it was entirely possible that it succumbed to nature years ago.  Yes I did grow up there up through the end of high school when I was able to escape.  I had a great upbringing there and KW will always hold a special place in my heart but I would NEVER live there again.  Its a great place to visit not so much to live.  I must concede though that there are many locals that do love and appreciate every single day there so it could just take a certain mentality to go beyond just tolerating it.  If you ever plan on going back down there you should check out going at the end of October for Fantasy Fest its the biggest event of the year and it is a lot of fun very similar to Mardi Gras but halloween style.,waterporn,d15a2vc,3,t5_2sgw7
