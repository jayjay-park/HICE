3564367,0,t3_315fc6,I cant speak for uultgamer but I can give you what I would assume will be his answer.The sub is rather small and rather inactive right now. While  toons is a really big accomplishment for us all starting out its nowhere near as strenuous to moderate as  toons would be. As of right now there really isnt a whole lot to moderate. The IRC is small  weve not even had more than  users at one time yet  and the activity in the sub is scattered and adheres to the rules almost perfectly.As well with this sub just starting out the exact direction of the Secret Toon Society and where its going to go  will there be runs? Will be have weekly discussion topics? Will we post photos of bananas every hour on the hour?  are things that have yet to be decided or discussed. From what hes said this will be a community sub with a different more relaxed take on moderating  as opposed to Here are your head mods obey more of a Here are people who are most helpful and active in the community theyre here to help improve your experiences  and so Im sure that as time passes the sub grows and becomes more active and details and directions are nailed down the criteria for becoming and a mod what is being looked for and all that fun stuff will be detailed.uultgamer will chime in here too Im sure but thats the best thing I can really come up with for you right now.,secrettoon,cpykbqh,2,t5_37h6f
