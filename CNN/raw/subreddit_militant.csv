10496084,0,t1_dcvmky1,Its been a day but Im gonna reply in case anybody wanders in looking for a counterpointmm is great for selfdefense. Stopping power is useless if you cant aim quickly or put repeat rounds on target. A mm is going to be lighter faster and carry up to  rounds compared to  for larger calibers.The Tankie AKSKS love doesnt make sense in the US. There are MILLIONS of rounds of NATO . floating around this country not so much for .xmm. Same with parts  one AR lower can swap uppers like legos for different applications. Want blk for hunting? Swap. . conversion? Swap and dropin mag well adapter. CarbinePistol length? Swap and so on.An AK is also HEAVY louder and punches you in the cheekbone with that big wooden stock every round you fire. Shotguns are great youre not wrong there. You can load the first round with rock salt or a beanbag for deterrent and then follow up with shot if you need it which is nice.Finally  NATO . comes out tumbling and fragments on oblique impact. If youre firing in your home its not going to go through a bunch of walls but will fragment on impact and disperse a lot of its energy. That and its a lightweight stable platform that makes it easy for even a  year old to put multiple rounds on target.,militant,dcxub23,1,t5_2sk3e
