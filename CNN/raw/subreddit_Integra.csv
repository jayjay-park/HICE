4670918,0,t1_ctjbfut,This is true but I wont do hardrace for personal reasons. Buddy club suspension has gone to shit unless you sped  or more. Vibrant exhausts are just another poor mans remedy. ,Integra,ctjbkhw,1,t5_2smu6
6634501,0,t1_d05k4u1,Its an exhaust leak. Its most likely not that big of a deal. The factory header comes in  pieces manifold amp down pipe. Possibly it got loosened or a hole was punctured. Id doubt a hole was punctured considering the factory down is pretty sturdy.Its been a long time since Ive had an Integra so I could be wrong.,Integra,d05kc43,1,t5_2smu6
