5003147,0,t1_cuoz0pp,AFAIK it always used to be referred to as the the Main Sub  and its a reflection of the hostility on SP IMO that allowed it to become to the norm.So unless we collectively get a grip and tone me down the hostilities I guess it will remain.,MagneticPersonalities,cup2ezv,3,t5_37tmd
5006825,0,t1_cupiask,Ohhh thanks for explaining that to me. Sadly it will be a whackamole game with your many alts too.,MagneticPersonalities,cupieqh,2,t5_37tmd
5103625,0,t1_cv15q8a,It isnt get quite that accurate.  If you tried tracing the IP above Monroe NY is awfully close to home.  But youre still missing my location by about  miles.  Im about  towns over.  While that doesnt sound like much thats a pretty big plus or minus.  Four towns in which direction?  So it can get an approximate area.  Something like Hillside Terrace would merely be where the Service Provider is located.  I cant even verify that how often does one check up the physical location of their Service Provider?  I happen to know that they have a central office much much closer to home.  I cannot say if that office is where Im logging into.  I imagine I would be but networking is never that simple.  My guess as a former IT tech is that Im physically connected to the central office here in town not the Monroe location.  That is merely putting me on their local network which is likely spread across the county if not farther.  That network in turn is what is connected to the Internet itself.  ,MagneticPersonalities,cv16dqg,3,t5_37tmd
5104444,0,t1_cv18ewt,gt My understanding is that Google Maps uses predominantly cell signals to triangulate you.It predominately uses GPSgt  But it is certainly not by IP Address.I dont think that is correct. Google often uses IP Addresses to locate devices.One example I flew to Miami with my phone off. When I turned my phone on while sitting at MIA and looked at Google Maps it showed me in Boston Logan no part of my flight went through Boston. I think thats because it used the planes WiFi to locate me even though I never connected to the planes Wifi or possibly another plane nearbys wifi. Thats a setting you can turn off in google but they do use it in addition to GPS to locate devices. In general I agree with all you wrote and your conclusions about this investigation. My theory is that they have found Yahoo mails IP in Sunnyvale CA and assumed it was the users static IP the fact we keep seeing people write static IP is one indication that I dont think were dealing with experts. However I also am not sure about your claim that your IP doesnt generally locate you. Yes if youre using mobile Id agree but your home IP gives a general location. I dont see how anybody would get CA from searching your IP.,MagneticPersonalities,cv19xvj,3,t5_37tmd
