It is weird I am in bronze yet only play against gold and sometimes silver opponents and win.

1038781,0,t3_25tgny,I personally like to keep room for  army hot keys even if I self only use all . For example I could have lingbane on  muta on  and infestor on . Or roachhydra on  viper on  and extra queens on .So my usual hot key set up is  main army  flyers  special unitsspell casters   all my inject queens  all hatcheries  upgrades evo chambers spire  roach warren etcFor hot keys where you have more then one type of unit you can hit TAB to cycle through them. This is especially handy for your upgrades hotkey or for a lingbane hotkey when you want to morph more banes. ,starcraft2,chmd48g,1,t5_2qspc
1314494,0,t3_293am6,Start following the main starcraft subreddit. Most of it is dedicated to following the proscene. Team Liquid is harder to crack but even more dedicated and used to be the only goto source for SC for english speakers especially back in the Brood Wars days.Day is great. He has a lot of dailies you could watch.  doesnt deal with strategy but is the most beloved and should be watched by anyone that likes esports. Playing can help but its not necessary. I have always sucked at SC and SC and have almost exclusively followed the scene without playing. You need to educate yourself on Brood War history. And like I said follow the main SC subreddit. This sub does not have a lot of activity and should not be your main source.Old Husky vids on YT is also a good source.,starcraft2,cihhwp3,1,t5_2qspc

2521901,0,t3_2o3nei,I think with the player ID system they should ban bar codes since they make it impossible to identify players and they should force every player to reveal all his alternative ids especially for diamond and above so that a player can know who he is playing against and there should be stiff penalties for players not disclosing thier ids. Such as  year bans or more like they do in the real world. Like if Kevin magnussen drives a different car or competes in a different category  you should still know that it is Kevin magnussen.,starcraft2,cmnr0ii,-1,t5_2qspc

It will be a little less competative and a little bit easier to make it into the upper leagues.

5836339,0,t3_3v6348,It will continue to survive but as a niche game with its niche esport fan. Unfortunately the core basis arent for anyone and to become a professional you need to be really good. Moreover other games like Leogue of Legends or Dota have higher prizes and paycheck while being less difficult I played SC adn LOL and i can say winning a game in sc is harder and require so much coordination and knowledge on how and when to act in ordeo to triumph. SC suffered for the unbalances that were present on HOTS and some unresolved issues on macromicro management. IMO its problem was being pretty static without any changes from seasons hence you would see the same strats and the same build. I remember the  min roaches build era which crippled all toss players and made that matchup pretty boring to watch. While moba games e.g. LOL have a different meta and radical changes each seasonyear which make the game appealing and interesting.,starcraft2,cxko64y,1,t5_2qspc
