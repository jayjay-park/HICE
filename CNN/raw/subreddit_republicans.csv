1182008,0,t1_ci2l8j9,Its a lot like fascism although you could put personal liberties as a high priority for the algorithm and the tech is probably not there yet but might emerge in the coming decades.  This also raises the question would you rather live in a society which is more topdown controlled if that meant in practice a better economy and more personal freedoms?  Do we want freedom for freedoms sake or do we like freedom because it is the most effective model?,republicans,ci2lg6c,1,t5_2r4xl

Trump clearly showed he isnt up to the task if he cant take heat from Megyn Kelly.  As the top candidate Id expect him to get pushed the most  cream rises to the top.  Hows he going to react when pressed by Merkel or Putin?,republicans,ctw3sr5,0,t5_2r4xl

5505820,0,t1_cwewl7i,Its totally inaccurate I was responding to the OP  no where on his website campaign messaging or OnTheIssues does he challenge that. But even if he did that wouldnt be reason enough to vote for someone so at odds in such an EXTREME capacity from core republicanconservativelibertarianmoderate beliefs. Campaign finance reform is a HUGE issue I agree with you on that. Unfortunately the way you fix that is not by electing one grassroots politician  that was supposedly Obama back in . Weve had plenty of outsider politicans who have been good and who have been bad. Bernies entire platform is very bad for America IMO. I dont believe our country can or should support socialist policies I think our Federal government is ALREADY far too powerful and that the government doesnt exist to solve the problems of the populous. I and many rightleaning people are very at odds with everything he is saying and stands for which was what I was trying to convey to the OP. ,republicans,cwff49c,1,t5_2r4xl

7415688,0,t1_d2l3ucg,I dont care if  David Koreshsp? himself was running for presiden. If the policies he advocates are sound how he chooses to worship his God or himself are no concern of mine. To the average mainline Protestant in the s and s I guarantee their views on Catholicism were quite strong. Probably just a strong as yours on Dominionsim. Obviously the obscure comment was sarcastic... Most people on here would have read the constitution at least once. Its  like  pages cover to cover when you print it on copy paper. My point was that if in the th century our founding fathers didnt see fit to bad people from office based on religion using it as a consideration now seems a bit backward. It is certainly your right to not vote for him based on religion but its no different than saying I wont vote for a Jew or a black or any other group. ,republicans,d2l4688,0,t5_2r4xl
