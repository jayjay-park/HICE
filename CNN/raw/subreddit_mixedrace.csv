1096529,0,t1_chsvqkn,Happy to. I know my situation is odd but its becoming more and more common as we see cultural and national boundaries mean less and less than they used to.As an aside your comments that reference ethnicity and culture made me want to comment further. I know its partially from marrying an anthropologist I had to find someone who could understand me but I do believe that race is a cultural construct. While race was the common delimiter from the th centuries I think its more important that as we move towards a more homogenous global skin tone and greater shared culture we focus more on the topics on culture and ethnicity and eliminate those outdated racial constructs that hold too many people back. tangent,mixedrace,chsxhbj,1,t5_2qnue

5584843,0,t1_cwpbghi,Yes in your experience. However usually when dominant features race are mixed with less dominant features race such as blue eyes fairer skin and dark hair the dominant feature such as dark eyes or skin tone would be more dominant. And if two dominant features would be put together one could question whether of the winning dominant race in the biracialmultiracial parents feature would be given to their children or the non visible one.,mixedrace,cwpco14,-2,t5_2qnue

7716609,0,t1_d3j9epc,I did present you the perspective of actual Hawaiians my family who I spent part of my childhood with literally growing up with the culture.  Im a little confused as to how that is invalidated to you via my mediation whereas you quoting your girlfriends opinion despite not being yourself Hawaiian isnt.Besides that I do get where youre coming from and its actually how I felt myself for many years.  I wasnt directly evaluating your comment I was explaining how the extenuation of some of the implied attitudes therein manifest in the real world for hapas and mixed race people.  Im sorry it read so negatively for you and clearly you dont see much merit in it.  Nonetheless that is part of the reality and Im also sorry I couldnt convey it more clearly.  ,mixedrace,d3jbqd7,6,t5_2qnue

8265171,0,t3_4skxy8,We had those kinds of clubs in middle and high school probably because university students did a lot of outreach with the local schools.In university I joined the club for mixed people. I made some good friends a lot of meh but it was interesting to share experiences with other mixed people. Most of the clubs at my school didnt exclude people of other races or religions. They were more like places to bond? To share culture etc with the broader student population on your own terms. A lot of the mixed people in my uni club were also members of monoracial groups. In the end though I made more friends in class. And those friends were often monoracial but from diverse backgrounds. ,mixedrace,d5apcpw,3,t5_2qnue
8528170,0,t1_d67fiho,Im sorry to hear that  i can understand the feeling like everyone else gets to choose things that are relevant to their personality or who they are where as you just get pigeonholed over something genetic that has no other bearing. Especially when its racial and not cultural. Like you dont wake up every morning being like wow good asian morning eveyone! Im going to go asianly eat my breakfast of sushi and noodles now and then walk asianly to school where i will excel at mathematics then come home and study asianly for  hours. I doubt anyone conciously goes about their life needing to think about their own race like that UNTIL people you know or meet do it to you then it can be quite jarring cause its like wait what? Does everything you know about me take a backseat to my racial makeup? And dont get me wrong there are many things culturally that i identify with that i just mentioned which i am happy to talk about but like i said it is racial and not cultural which makes all the difference.Also when you are mixed ive noticed if you are half white people often discount it one drop rule style. Like as if that whole side of your family doesnt count and has no cultural relevance. Or the reverse if you live in the nonwhite dominant culture i have experienced both and trust me asians are very openly racist towards white people.Anyway i wont keep going cause i feel like i can ramble for ages on this topic haha but i guess if it makes you feel any better it is frustrating sometimes being mixedracial minority as it leaves you stuck in a sort of limbo and people make xenophobic assumptions about you BUT it does leave you with a much deeper and more nuanced understanding of different types of people and can give you a perspecitive that is unique as it can come from  different POVs. Try not to let people who say dumb stuff get to you as often they just dont know any better or are overly focusedobsessed with race which is something that is becoming less and less relevant as the years go by. ,mixedrace,d67l2bm,3,t5_2qnue

But now that Im an adult its that much more surreal how incredibly petty and cruel people can be to children. What the fuck does a grown ass person gain by belittling a childs hair texture or threatening to beat someones kid? I cant imagine a situation where Id say half this shit to a parent or child mixed race or no and yet people twice our age were comfortable dropping ugly comments like this every day to you and countless other mixed kids. I hope you still love your hair and your heritage and they didnt tear that down for you. ,mixedrace,dalczn2,2,t5_2qnue
10275513,0,t3_5n42h2,Sorry to hear about the abuse you suffered OP  I cant comment on the feelings aspect of your post unfortunately. But I can maybe help with rebuilding your connection to the Chinese part of your identity which you seem to be keen to do.uLikeableMisanthrope already mentioned food which I think is a great thing to learn about  both cooking and appreciation. I dont think Ive ever met another Asian who wasnt happy to chat about food. It makes for great smalltalk.Language I think is important  My family is from the NT but my Cantonese is relatively poor. I recently started learning Mandarin as that was the only language available to me and even though Im progressing slowly I do feel more of a connection to my Chinese roots. Not like Im becoming more Chinese or anything but that I at least understand a little more about the culture bit by bit.Culture and tradition can be difficult things to get into in isolation  Im sure youve tried reading up and visiting museums and the like. Does your city have a Chinese New Year celebration? That can be a great way of getting into it and maybe even finding out about some groups you can get involved with socially.As to your last name  its not unknown throughout Chinese history for people to take on the surname of a beloved mentor or a respected teacher. If you wanted to change your name but keep it Chinese that may be one way of achieving it. Even if theres nobody you would change your name for right now maybe in the future someone will impact your life enough to do so?Anyway Im probably rambling. I hope Ive managed to at least help a little bit  all the best to you and I hope you find what youre looking for.,mixedrace,dc8s9oi,3,t5_2qnue
