7924606,0,t1_d46qu5e,So I looked into a bit more and realized the winrate selection is what I was asking for. However it still doesnt add up even though its very close of being accurate. I selected Arthas with no map selected and it says my win percentage with Kael will be . when its supposed to be . which was current hotslogs data. Does this change because of popularity and v winrates? If so how does popularity affect winrates? Rexxar and Lost Vikings have low popularity but that definitely doesnt mean theyre a worse of a pick than other heroes that are more popular.Also what kind of v data are we talking about custom games? I personally wouldnt trust non serious gameplay. Its why hotslogs gives data on the front screen where heroes are level  and are playing hero league. Maybe youre using the calculation of both hero league and team league combined? Also it would be nice if map winrate played a factor in winrate that would significantly improve the features accuracy.Sorry for the wall of text just providing some feedback I definitely love the changes though.,HeroesCounters,d46subb,2,t5_37iss
