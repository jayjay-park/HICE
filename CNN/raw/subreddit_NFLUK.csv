29381,0,t1_cehrkrw,Well youve already outclassed me by my applying to Harvard as a side note extracurriculars are a big determination of whether you get into US schools as opposed to UK which ive heard are purely based off marks or so ive heard. The city is full of students especially if you stick near campus or around the hipster areas but its a city like any other so of course theres the general population. There are lots of other schools in the area too such as Berkeley so theres a lot of diversity as far as student population.As far as winter compared to south England well ive never been to south England but it can be pretty harsh in New England. Boston is usually spared the brunt of it with westerncentral Mass mostly getting the full load but it can certainly get pretty bad. Depending on the storm system Boston sometimes gets pretty heavy snow. Make sure to dress is layers and get some good boots.,NFLUK,cehrzoi,1,t5_2yr0f
