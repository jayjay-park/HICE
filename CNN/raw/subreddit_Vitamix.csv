2289276,0,t1_cluicwd,Thanks! Ive actually had luck with a bit of the really thick canned coconut milk as well since posting this. Yogurt is on my list of things to try.,Vitamix,cluo5qc,1,t5_2sb9p

4100358,0,t1_crnfv3h,Thanks.  Were about ready to give up and exchange it.  I think there is honestly something wrong with it.  I cant make a single item unless its pure liquid without it getting immediately stuck in that whirring mode.  Even when Im very aggressively tampering everything it still happens.  I went to Costco and watched the Vitamix guy make some things and went home and tried the EXACT same process and amounts of things and it was vastly different than his experience.  Im pretty convinced we got a bad unit!,Vitamix,crnnzli,1,t5_2sb9p

6574024,0,t3_45naml,Vitamix is not a juicer.  This is a good thing as juice is the least healthy part of the fruit  its mostly sugar without the fiber.  Some nutritionists have said that drinking pure fruit juice isnt really much better for you than drinking soft drinks.If you want juice you can do what a juicer does  run it through a strainer to get out the good part the pulp.  But youd be better off adding cranberries to oranges maybe a few dates to sweeten it a bit and perhaps some other fruit then add ice water milk soy milk or nut milk to make a healthy drink.,Vitamix,czzb4df,3,t5_2sb9p

6892883,0,t1_d0xk9he,i am really considering getting one just to try it out so ill let you know! but i do know that the gseries models are supposed to be at least  decibels quieter than the classic models...so if the counter in the video is based on decibels  all the way down to  seems almost too good to be true actually.,Vitamix,d0xmk17,1,t5_2sb9p
10196710,0,t1_dbz0mmq,For sure thanks! One of my friends has the  and the other has a  and he tells me he doesnt use the presets and even if he does its rare. ,Vitamix,dbzuqf2,1,t5_2sb9p
10805672,0,t1_ddft3xj,The A is my favorite in the new line! Great choice. I dont find any more convenience in the touch screens and LOVE the presets. I also prefer the manual onoff and pulse switches. ,Vitamix,dduj209,1,t5_2sb9p

11609519,0,t1_dgbobaa,Any chance you can link me to the mothers day promo?whats the difference between an ascent vs a legacy? I read somewhere that there are touchscreen models im NOT looking for that. I want the simplest most robust blender I can get. Something that can easily be repaired or have parts replaced if need be.,Vitamix,dgby6jl,1,t5_2sb9p
11703156,0,t3_66fcg0,I get a bag of every frozen vegetable and berry in the frozen aisle at costco and just dump in a bit of each every time to make a green veggie smoothie. Apparently blended veggies have much higher bioavailability of nutrients than non blended since the blenders break through the cell walls.,Vitamix,dgmkl6q,1,t5_2sb9p
