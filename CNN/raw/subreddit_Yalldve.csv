11316451,0,t3_61ieof,The Second Conquest was the Ascended Empires military campaign to conquer their entire continent. They launched the First Conquest already in which they took over their neighbours and theyd just recently brought up the Aether Suppressor to stop manas natural flow into the world of Yalldve done mostly for religious reasons. They needed to construct towers to carry the block on the Aether across the continent. Obviously the easiest way is to steamroll everyone else on the continent to ensure peace.Pictured is a standard fullhead helmet used by the Empirical Forces frontline soldiers. They had plenty of benefits which Ill list in bullet point form since thats more visually interesting A layer of steel covering the entire head. This might not actually do a lot against weapons in our time but at the beginning of the Second Conquest the Ascended Empires enemies had early rifles at best. Adorned with ambercolored crystals. The official color of the Ascended Empire is gold but they also like crystals. So they used the crystals with the closest color to gold they could find for helmets. These are adorned on the forehead cheeks and with larger ones attached to the sides of the head. These are intended to be for appearancebased purposes only but the crystal parts turned out to be quite bulletresistant dozens of soldiers have been saved by projectiles hitting the crystals and thus not being able to penetrate the layer of steel. The crystal filters over the eyes can function as night vision lenses. Activatable with a switch on the back of the helmet the lenses covering the eyes can be switched into night vision lenses for nighttime operations. Unlike our night vision goggles on Earth these ones usually illuminate everything in a soft red. Filters over the mouth allow oxygen in but deny several types of poisons. Resistance fighters at Smomulous used poisonous gas several times on the Empirical forces so air filters were considered crucial for invasions after that. They looked almost alien. This was certainly part of the Ascended Empires plan. They wanted to come across as something beyond human. Whether this means they were seen as evil aliens who are pointless to resist or as wise beings from a far away land just wanting to bring their greater vision of the world the image was beneficial for the Empires war aspirations.With these important features the forces of the Ascended Empire gained a sort of feared reputation among the conquered. Rumors said that these soldiers were superhumans who didnt need to breathe wore indestructible crystals into battle and could hear the heartbeats of their enemies and thus never miss a shot even in pitch darkness. One of the last nations conquered in the Second Conquest just surrendered right after the Empirical Forces arrived not wanting to be slaughtered by these supermen.The names of these nations are irrelevant. That was prehistory after all! We are the Ascended Empire the only relevant parts of the world were the ones we controlled and now the whole world is relevant because of our valor!,Yalldve,dfep9en,1,t5_3j3zc
