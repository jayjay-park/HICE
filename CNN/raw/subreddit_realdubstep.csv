777709,0,t3_231hwf,Kode Boddika Ramadanman Loefah Mala Blawan Joy O Lee Foss DuskyYeah I know not all of them are strictly dubstepsome are just straight house but I typically like to listen to label bosses and others that get killer tracks sent to them every day by producers agents or labelmates.  Plus most of these guys might not play  dubstep the whole time but they are certainly on the cutting edge when it comes to the progression of bassdance music.Also  I get why people like soundcloud and artist pages on facebook but honestly I hate sifting through artists whose work is eclectic or tries to sound like their influences or lacks cohesion.  Quality control is a key element missing from a lot of smaller artistsproducers.  If some of these guys would hold off on publishing everything collect a few songs that actually go together and put out an EP with a focus and a target audiencemarket theyd likely do quite well be played.  In a lot of cases I think there are talented guys making great music but they lack a fundamental understanding of business and branding that they need to success in the entertainment industry.rant,realdubstep,cgsohad,2,t5_2s9pu

The point of music subreddits is to discover new music and discuss them.

2262498,0,t3_2l1yon,I used to listen to real fruitcake music like anime theme song type music. Then I listened to rap and hip pop for a while and had a whole swag snapbacks and fresh jordans phase but then I heard this dubstep remix of Foster The People  Pumped up Kicks. After that I looked up dubstep charts and just listened to stuff off of that and it was all brostep. Really was into brostep until it became dead and all my fave producers started making other stuff.One day I was looking at an article about the top  dubstep songs and I think it had request line as number one. Started listening to skream on and off but it started to get boring. I went back to brostep got boring again so back to skream. After I listening to the whole Skream! album that s when I started listening to all the old school dubstep stuff ya know dubstep warz dmz  caspa all the good stuff.Then over the summer I looked up some of the people on dubstep warz and I was excited to figure out that they were still playing! I was looking for a dubstep radio and thats when I found rinse fm and started listening to youngstas show. Loved it and from there ive just gotten deeper and deeper into the true sound.But right now im finally starting to like  bass and getting more into the experimental and less cookie  cutter dubstep songs. ,realdubstep,clrd5lu,1,t5_2s9pu

Something I find really admirable about Dubstep is that is has so many different styles within it but nobody really drew any lines and said This is a distinct subgenre. Drum and Bass and Metal are terrible about this. So many subgenres its overwhelming. Not to mention the clear division of the communities. A lot of progressive metal nerds basically denounce types of metal like Grindcore.

9578652,0,t3_5c1iby,The United States is extremely lucky that no honest charismatic figure has arisen. Every charismatic figure is such an obvious crook that he destroys himself like McCarthy or Nixon or the evangelist preachers. If somebody comes along who is charismatic and honest this country is in real trouble because of the frustration disillusionment the justified anger and the absence of any coherent response. What are people supposed to think if someone says I have got an answer we have an enemy? There it was the Jews. Here it will be the illegal immigrants and the blacks. We will be told that white males are a persecuted minority. We will be told we have to defend ourselves and the honor of the nation. Military force will be exalted. People will be beaten up. This could become an overwhelming force. And if it happens it will be more dangerous than Germany. The United States is the world power. Germany was powerful but had more powerful antagonists. I dont think all this is very far away. If the polls are accurate it is not the Republicans but the rightwing Republicans the crazed Republicans who will sweep the next election.

9618626,0,t1_d9yf9jo,I can agree with this. I see UKDubstep tm as less of a rigid genre but more of a well to draw from. a sort of collective experience an entire generation participated in and something we all grew up with.As such I see influences to the left and right of me. Just listen to anything coming out of the UK now or over the last  years from pop to techno to house to funky to grime to dnb to garage etc. its all influenced. ,realdubstep,d9yoz5x,2,t5_2s9pu
