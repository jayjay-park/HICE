842352,0,t3_23qnym,This is a trigger question for Burners. I dont really care but I think the vocal participants dont want any recording going on. Its a shame its turned out that way in my very humble opinion. Some of us may remember The Grateful Dead which not only allowed recording of their concerts but the sale of the bootleg tapes this was in the day of tapes. People sold their tapes in the parking lots outside the concerts. It was a cottage industry that supported some of the concertgoers and fostered a community of deadheads.I think its impractical to think people arent going to record things at Burning Man. People record everything in all of their lives. Expecting to prevent people from recording the events at a Burn is doomed to disappointment. If he wants to wear it its a free country. My recommendation would be a sign or some other readable note that tells people to smile and wave at his camera which takes pictures every  seconds. People who care can move or cover their faces those of us who dont care can ignore him or happily pose for the picture. That this camera is disguised gives people a legitimate beef again in my humble opinion.Just letting people know its going on seems to me to be a courtesy some would appreciate.If I were going to do this Id get a GoPro or similar camera with a second timer and an LCD that shows the photo taken so people could see pose and appreciate whats going on. Make it public art instead of surreptitious. But to each his own.,BurningMan,ch010v9,8,t5_2qj68

882059,0,t3_247haz,Unless you have someone with early entry staking out a camp any plans on specific areas is doomed. Youll have to just drive around a general area of the city and find space.The only quiet area of Burning Man is Hushville. The rest is open season on noise at all hours of the daynight. Art cars will drive around at am blasting very loud music maybe stopping right next to where you are sleeping for an hour. Generators will be running everywhere people partying playing music walking by yelling etc. Burning Man is very noisy.The furthest reaches of the city will be your best bet for low noise but that is all relative. Generally its not very loud all the time but it will be random when it is loud.My suggestion would be to get central going out to  or  will put you way away from the other side of the city. Also the  and  radials are where all the huge sound camps are so noise will be ever present . They can be very very loud on the level of large outdoor rock concerts. Somewhere between  would get you away from that  being dead center and the furthest away from massive sound systems you can get. Except for the roving art cars that drive up and down the streets.Also generator noise is all relative. A good quiet Honda genny is vastly quieter than a cheap unmuffled monster.

1057039,0,t1_choemoh,Thank you.I have posted a few more details to this account on our website.Slightly edited for languageAs for...The schism due to disagreements too complex to delve into on my phone mentioned by Frankie Benjamin...The ugly truth is that women were approaching me about being raped by a man who showed up on the scene of one Burner Group in Vancouver. They turned to me for help and I asked for my peers to respect their privacy and just watch the guy.But there was little accountability because we were not a formal organisation.He was a genuine asshole.This was all confirmed to me by Police who later contacted me for assistance in an investigation involving a child and allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour around that child. I connected them with the people hed assaulted they were terrified of him.I could not in good conscience contribute my good will that people trusted and respected at that time to anything he was involved in. He was using that trust to take advantage of very good women and new people who felt on the fringe of this thing that was becoming a scene.So Burn BC was formed to offer accountability.But some people who this fellow had embedded himself with could not participate with Burn BC.I think that might explain this ugly period of our Vancouver History that I have long since put behind me with a clear conscience.Peace.Napalm Dragon  ,BurningMan,chofuhs,2,t5_2qj68

1212202,0,t3_27wz42,One of my favorite memories of BRC was getting a reprimand from Robocop for jaywalking across the Esplanade. This guy had an fantastically realistic Robocop costume with sound effects voicemodulation and all. Your move creep.Another good one happened in the middle of a dust storm . In almost a complete white out a USPS mail truck slowly drives up. The driver in Postal Service garb steps out and says Oh Thank God! Ive been looking for you all day!! delivers a letter and slowly drives off. It was the last thing anyone would expect and certainly adds to the mystery and absurdity of BRC.For my own stuff I have an installation called SoundPuddle which is sort of an audio spectrumanalyzer that you can go inside of. Its a neat environment for performance as whatever sounds people make are visualized as ripples of color.At our regional burn last week we had all kinds of musical instruments violins guitars saxophones etc monkey chanting poetry storybook readings signalongs. Hopefully well have lots of similar interaction this year on the playa.I dont know if that falls within the scope that youre looking for but the technologically enabled synethesia of the installation provides a new sensory layer to live performances inside the space.,BurningMan,ci5zoru,3,t5_2qj68

Then the loops are the right size to fit over the stakes assuming youre using the smoothish cement stakes from HD rather than rebar I dont know how well rebar does or doesnt work havent tried it. So you slip them down over the stakes youve pounded in for the hut then put the PVC over the stakes then once the hut tarp is on throw rope over the top tie to the middle on one side pull a bunch to tighten down and tie on the other side. It made our hut really solid in the wind. A little expensive to get  of them but at least we got carabiners out of it too ,BurningMan,ckabi5p,1,t5_2qj68

1843671,0,t3_2fluad,I had the wonderful opportunity Wednesday ? night while out at the trash fence to meet a man named Timothy. When I asked him how many burns he had been to he just smiled and said I was at the second Burning Man.This being my first Burning Man that idea just blew my mind. Standing before me was a man who experienced Burning Man while it was still on the beach. While it was still an infant. Barely a cohesive idea. Before I could stop myself questions were flying from me. What was it like? How has it changed? Do you like what Burning Man has become?The answer I received surprised me and filled me with joy. Its become more than I could ever imagine and I love it. I expected at least something negative about present day Burning Man. Of all the people I expected jaded snarkiness from it was him. He showered nothing but positives though.Its true that Burning Man has changed. I dont have to be a veteran to figure that one out. Change doesnt have to be a bad thing though. Change is growth. Without growth things become stagnant and die.The opportunity to talk to Timothy stands as one of the highlights of my burn this year.Edit  Apparently Im just easily amused.

The last time I built a large shade structure was almost  years ago so Im not up on the latest in playa building technology. To start Id recommend checking out photos online until you find one you like. You should be able to get a name to search for.

2860184,0,t1_cnt3yc7,Well as noted Ive taken a Ti since ... I wouldnt want to imply that everything will be fine. Maybe I just got lucky  its in no way billed as a weather resistant camera. But your main issue is dust getting into the camera.  You can tape over the SD card door and the battery door if that makes you feel more comfortable.  Rather than buy a second camera body again Im not responsible! you might want to look into a second hand sturdy prime lens i.e one that isnt going to be expanding and contracting and moving dust through the mechanism.  This year my main prime lens was in for repairs I dropped it on the sidewalk oops.... and I took a mm SuperTakumar ..  Its a somewhatvintage lens.  Its fully manual and it has a slight yellowish cast to it... I did not get the chance to find an ND filter for it and in day time you kinda need one.... If youre into fully manual photography thats one way to go and hopefully everything goes fine and you end up with another lens in your lens collection and at the end of the day lenses are the real addiction.... and note also to factor in that you may or may not have access to power to charge batteries.... buying a second camera body potentially means buying a few spare batteries for that particular camera... ,BurningMan,cnt7d1p,2,t5_2qj68

2942288,0,t1_co1v994,I didnt. I needed to get at the very small buttons on the camera constantly to adjust settings. I kept a micro fiber cloth with me at all times I brought several and used it to keep dust off the lens. A good clear lens filter is extremely important. The camera got dusty BUT the GH has a weather proof sealed body. I did worry when I needed to change lenses but I always did it in my dome as quickly as possible. We also brought two hard drives with phantom power and a laptop to triple back up the footage everyday. Shooting at Burning Man is not for wimps. It was the hardest shoot Ive ever attempted. I know how this sounds but The Playa is gonna make you work for every frame of footage you get. Its not gonna give it up easily. Everything that can go wrong WILL. The weather will not cooperate the citizens of the city will work against you and no one but yourself and your crew will give two shits about what you are trying to do.All that said the footage we got was breathtaking and all worth the very considerable headache.The film is almost done and soon we will be sharing it with the Burning Man Community.In closing I say again  PLAN PLAN PLAN. Because The Playa WILL try to break you. It almost broke me.Good Luck!,BurningMan,co2juu6,1,t5_2qj68

I feel I get much more out of  the event if I volunteer in a camp or on a team.  If youre on the shy side its an especially good way to meet people.  One year I volunteered to deliver papers for the Black Rock Beacon.  It was awesome having a paper route and meeting people along the way.  That being said... is it possible to have a bad experience being part of a camp?  Absofuckinglutely and timesoutof the reason is the person is a lazycreepy selfabsorbed prick that takes away from the community.  If youre the type of person that doesnt clean up after yourself or youre only there to score drugs get laid show up unprepared and mooch off others without helping yes by all means dont join a camp.  Camp by yourself.  But if you are respectful and conscientious being part of a camp can be extrarewarding.,BurningMan,com83f7,1,t5_2qj68

3181578,0,t1_corfleq,Its late.  Ill only respond to one of these. Yes in this datadriven age I have an expectation that BM will operate a more inclusive more transparent and more open process than other less enlightened organisations or forprofit events.  Three numbers just doesnt cut it.   Zero explanation for wait times that never decrease which is mathematically impossible. In short yes  I expect BM to do more than provide three simple numbers and a single blog entry to try to explain the anomalies that a number of people saw.  They are our representatives to Ticketfly who ultimately held the sale on our behalf.Apparently Ticketfly DO generate detailed statistics I can guarantee that I can snapshot one of these charts within  minutes convert it to a JPEG image and upload it to most blog sites including ones Ive never used before.  BM can certainly do this for us but perhaps the main blog poster isnt technically savvy.  If he isnt then he should delegate detailed analytics to someone else and ask them to update the blog with those details.  Either that or an analytics blog entry done by someone who knows their shit with the current fluffy patonthehead blog entry by someone who doesnt.Are you seriously saying that if you COULD receive better analytics that you dont want them?  Because apparently the details are right there already and presumably accessible to BMorg.  Thats actually the one question Id love an answer on.,BurningMan,corrpzw,1,t5_2qj68

Their clocks were set to the wrong time  apparently out by almost  seconds or the entire sellout period. Basically  theyve committed a number of errors all of which would not lean in their favour from a Judicial perspective.There have been a number of times where class action suits have changed corporate behaviour for the better.

This worked really well for us. We got to eat delicious hearty food every night and everyone only had to cook one night so it actually ended up feeling like less work. My lady and I cooked up a massive batch of thai curry and spring rolls and froze them. They stayed frozen in our cooler and kept everything else cold for a few days and even after it all melted it stayed very cold.

I was dressed as a pirate that day.  All day long people popped into his RV yelling his name and looking at me with a blank stare saying you arent undisclosed buddy.  Then going off to tell him that he had a fucked up pirate in his RV.I kept telling him that I could just go back to my camp and be a piece of shit there and he just said Hey man I have been there.  Sit tight and we will take care of you.I personally think that he really enjoyed all of the people who searched for him to tell him that there was a fucked up pirate in his RV.

5058911,0,t1_cuvj5kx,It was great! Hes turning a year old on Saturday and had a blast. Hes at such a great explorative age and he LOVES people. He climbed on everything ate at the French Quarter bounced on all kinds of trampolines hell he ate lamb cooked on Man embers Sunday morning. I think the age of the kids and their temperament are the key and what kind of burn you want to have. Im more of a day burner who likes exploring and finding adventures art crafts etc. I dont really drink or anything so the party scene isnt my jam. Our kid is really good he didnt have any meltdowns or anything but we go to Disneyland a few times a month so hes used to the stimulation and strangers. But all in all it really wasnt that different from what I would have done without him. I have a Yepp seat on the front of my bike so he could see everything and my husband had a trailer behind his. I carry him a lot so he napped either on us or in the trailer. He wore swim goggles which I wasnt really expecting to work. But being on the bike thrilled him so he didnt even notice. A year ago I never thought Id bring a baby but hes beyond good and the diapers werent the hassle I was expecting. I know he wont remember it but he really truly enjoyed himself and it was great seeing the cogs in his little head turn all week. I also figured he might be a little dick next year hell be a week shy of  and the developmental timing worked out great. If your kids arent terrors and you wont be bummed to miss orgies and drugs I think youll have an amazing experience with them. Kidsville was great because there were other kids around for him to play with. You still provide everything yourself but have your own spot sectioned off. It wasnt necessary to camp with them at all but there werent drunk people and cigarettes around which was nice. Check out Black Rock Scouts too. They had activities every day with various camps. I know they went to the observatory rangers a science camp and we actually ran into them running all the carnival games at the midway one day. It was adorable! A bunch of art cars showed up one made nitrogen ice cream another kidnapped the kids to go tour the deep playa. Even with such a small kid it was great to see it through his eyes and made me so excited for future adventures there and elsewhere with him!,BurningMan,cuvsft0,3,t5_2qj68

Here you can see the same bamboo left behind.  Here is a preburn photo showing the same chair as in this photo.  This angle shows the chair from behind.  Would you care to address at least those two items?  Are you suggesting that someone else brought identical items to your space between the time you left and when the photos were taken on Monday afternoon?gtThey confirmed that no trash was left on our side and they know who left it.They know who left no trash?gtbut I know from the cups who came the day after that you both had some issuesYou dont even know who I am.  Im not party to the legal action I wasnt one of the ones who pulled him twice out of the tent and I had no contact with him after.  I didnt even know if he was still on the playa after Sunday.  I posted the trash pictures as an entirely separate issue and it was never a personal problem.gtthey asked around and its all good except the same guy who had problems with Balls.Nope not me.  I slept through most of it and didnt even know what camp it was until well after.Since you are an entirely different person from all of those other reddit accounts and have a different perspective as one of the camp organizers maybe you could give us a little insight as to what went wrong with the MOOP removal and the conflicting stories as to who was there on Monday and Tuesday to finish cleanup.,BurningMan,cuwyihp,13,t5_2qj68

So if the community cant support the art for the sake of art then what the hell have we all been doing for all this time?

Let alone a ton of my local burner scene whos contribution as theme camps is some tired jokes LED rope lights and an open mostly untended bar. its great that some people get really inspired. One of the reason folks like me talk about the culture so much is we really were hooked by that part more than the shiny things it was being a part of a social movement something larger than ourselves and when new people choose not to embrace that or actively ignore it it feels bad. ,BurningMan,czxkn7t,2,t5_2qj68
6599496,0,t3_459vav,Stagetype fixtures have more punch on playa than they do on a stage.  Every year I bring about a dozen IP rated LED fixtures which range in output from watts.  Even the w LEDs punch through the background levels of countless  strings EL wire etc with ease.  In terms of surviveability IP rating or better for your fixtures is pretty important if you expect to use anything for more than one year.  If you really want a moonflower be ready to tear it apart after each year and clean it really well.  Keep it bagged when not in use.For entrylevel DMX control I recommend QLC running on an old toughbook outputting from an openDMX USB device.  You can use a cheap DJ style DMX board but expect the faders to die almost instantly.

You can actually put the sensor in a sort of proximity mode and they can detect a hand a few inches away which makes me think that the acrylic doesnt do much to decrease performance.  The film itself is a pretty flimsy too.  Id hate to have it exposed to the elements directly.And yes the edges of the acrylic are totally badass edgelit with addressable LEDs.

This is the beginning of rattling the hornets nest and it has nothing to do with the fees themselves. They will push the BLM will push back. At which point they will use BLMs push back as justification for moving the entire event to land they own.  And it is a good thing. Once BM is on private land this limits the BLMs power. It also gives them a long term plan for the land itself. They can trench in fibre and power. They could even strike a deal to connect the local rail lines.

Just run the lag through it with a wash to help true the bracket and youd be fine. Something like this could work though a longer vertical would help this is just the closest I found without a ton of searching.Additionally lags are so easy to put in you could put one or two in the middle of each space between the legs and then attached the tarpshade to that instead with linerope. If your tarp is ran overtop of the ribs then itd help to keep it down.Again this is untested theories so really Im just speaking out of my ass.

8865745,0,t1_d7dh6xr,Wow!! That is such an incredibly relevant and articulate and lovely response. lt and SO MANY kisses and hugs! Thank you for sharing that so eloquently with me.Ive been thinking about what I learned on the Playa I was a birgin until this week and was putting my thoughts down over the last  days and the point you make about intention was my  takeaway  intentions matter how you frame yourself your patterns of behavior and your thoughts when entering any situation determines what you make of it and how you guide the situation itself. So the use of intention in your response really strikes a chord with me and brings a smile. Thank you for validating what Ive been feeling and exploring all week. This was something the soulmate and I talked about too! That intentions matter and how you come into anything including Burning Man will determine the path your universe will take. Another insighttakeaway I had was that around unconditional giving and what it means. I hadnt explored the idea too much except that being in that mental state allowed me to give both physically and emotionally and I never felt like running scarce ever. So what you say is very much aligned with what I had in my head but youve fleshed it out and articulated it much better than I had. Would you mind if I used this? In case it takes shape into an article or writeup of some sort I will definitely accredit a fellow Burner from SF on reddit as the source of this pearl of wisdom. Again thank you for moving the narrative and thought process in my head forward.Finally I was standing at the trash fence and trying to figure out the underlying metaphor for this boundary and it occurred to me that the fences are essentially our own way of saying that the Burn can be experienced but only within its defined confines that even our most best self has its limits within which it can be explored. And I think what youre pointing out here re. the dichotomy between being our giving freely selfless self on the playa and the layers of selfdefense and rationing we build in the default fits perfrectly along those lines. Dont you agree?That was a wonderful thing to read today. Ive been on cloud  since coming back to default I want to carry what Ive learned in the burn forward into my default life and you just helped me out even more. lt,BurningMan,d7djdqi,4,t5_2qj68

It was the stupidest thing Ive ever done. It got approved I made it I learned a ton but jesus christ. Eight months of work one hour cumulative drive time.Use a gas golf cart. I didnt want to drop  on a golf cart so I ended up spending thousands on a custom electric system. Dont do that. Come up with a mutation so good that they wont say no. Start it before the application is approved because fuck it art cars are awesome and you want one anyway. Make sure its fully done before you even think about towing it to playa. No you will not be doing any assembly or major work on playa. Its going to cost you a fucking fortune no matter what. Get it right and get it safe because you only have one shot at the DMV. And make sure you have an unopened bottle of alcohol with you when you go to the DMV and give it to them dont let them see it onin your car.And no proving those assholes on ePlaya wrong is not a good reason to blow all your money on an art car.

8919574,0,t3_52g6qi,It was Sunday night and our theme camp was almost completely finished so we decided to go out and enjoy ourselves. My friend a virgin burner had already injured himself riding the oil drum at the Duck Pond so he was having trouble keeping up with me during our ride. After we got separated a few times I decided to go off and do my own thing.As I began to journey on my own I turned my attention to the deep playa and began to ride my bike. I deftly maneuvered around deep drifts of sand or simply powered through them. It was no more than a few minutes into my ride that I saw a woman running toward me in the dark yelling No! Dont! Stop!Before I go any further I should mention that one of my playa personas is a superhero I created almost a decade ago for Bay to Breakers. I was dressed in a red muscles suit covered in Dr. Seuss fur.I immediately jumped off my bike and ran toward her noticing a man trailing closely behind her. My presence startled them both as I moved to step between them and told the man to stop. I held my arms wide physically separating them as much as possible as I took stock of the situation. The couple admitted they were exes. I asked them to take deep cleansing breaths with me in through the nose and out through the mouth. After a few breaths we began to talk about the situation I tried my best to mediate. When it became clear to me that they needed a private moment to speak I took a step back. When I was assured that everything was okay we all hugged each other and went our separate ways into the night.,BurningMan,d7k03fp,12,t5_2qj68
8920085,0,t3_52g6qi,I went this year with a friend and his wife and we were all sharing a yurt along with their default world neighbor a person Id only very briefly met at a dinner in SF months ago. Monday on a whim and still not  knowing each other after just  days in camp she and I decided to do something different from the rest of the group who planned to roll and hit sounds camps  cars and instead we took mushroom chocolates and went off on an adventure of our own.It was the first night the playa was in full neon maelstrom mode Sat and Sun were less fully frenetic. The air was incredibly warm and incredibly clear and after the drugs kicked in we just wandered from art piece to art piece with only a vague destination in mind... We had random encounters with people. Giggled like crazy people. Explored. Stopped and stared at the chaos. At the peak we ended up under Firmament and were just blown away we spent a couple hours entranced by the art. Neither of us really said anything as we just lay there close together and experienced the universe from the ground. It was so nice being with someone who didnt feel the need to fill space with unnecessary talking and instead just was happy to soak in the present... the music the lights and all the people swirling around us.After that we went to Mayan Warrior found it wasnt the scene for our drug that night and instead followed the lasers out deeper into the playa away from the car to watch the electric show over our heads. At some point we decided to leave the lasers behind and rode over to see BAAHS at Sonic Runway. They were playing fun music and the Runway was amazing as expected  so we rode up and down the tunnel a few times before planning on heading out again.As we were getting ready to leave Sonic Runway the person on the car who controls the spotlights that come out of the BAAHS sheeps eyes happened to shine them both out on the deep playa and from our perspective the two combined spotlights looked like a single round spot of light on the playa.So we rode towards it.We got closer and the spot just kept elongating into the distance  foreshortening perspective had made it look like a circle from next to BAAHS when really it went far across the playa. We started weaving laughing and wildly riding down this road of light in the middle of deep darkness. We were the only two people doing it and our shadows stretched out forever...After that we explored the lightless outer reaches. We went to the trash fence stared off into the emptiness of the open playa and talked for a long time about lots of things personal and not  it really felt like the beginning of a solid friendship  connection.We met some more people saw some more things and eventually circled back home to camp as the first blushes of the sun were on the horizon....Later in the week we ended up meeting the guy who was operating the lights on BAAHS that night and he said that he saw us ride out and thought that he should move the light to not bother us but then saw us having fun riding around in it and left them pointed out for us.All in all just one of those magically perfect playa nights!,BurningMan,d7k2azu,31,t5_2qj68

9024906,0,t1_d7wefgg,I think youre missing and misunderstanding part of what I said. Also the way I wrote this made some of what happened unclear My friend was uncomfortable with the guy doing whippets in his RV. He asked me about this after the burn because he was uncomfortableworried that he could get in trouble if the dude got busted. At the time he figured whatever because the rest of the people he was camping with kinda rolled their eyes over it and went on and he didnt want to cause a scene. But he didnt like it because he didnt know if he could get in trouble from it and because it seemed sketchy to HIM and me too but he brought this all up that the lead was doing something that would supposedly get someone kicked out of his camp.  I didnt explicitly write it but my friend  because of his discomfort  is the person who challenged the lead about him doing whippets. He first asked his friends about why whippet lead was doing whippets after the explicit no drugs within plain sight thing and they rolled their eyes and said ask him. So he asked the guy doing the whippets who also rolled his eyeswas rude and said it really didnt matternobody would seeetc. FTR my friend can make whatever decisions he wants to about who he wants to camp with. I dont feel inclined to judge him for it either way though I do judge the lead and and sure Ill be the hypocrite police on that one. Im a lead myself and Ive worked with leads like him who have made my week harder when campers come to me and say Why is lead doing X when we were told we couldnt do X?. But he asked my opinion because of his discomfort I gave him my answer on how Id feel about it and then I came here more opinions. I also sent him a link to this thread which he was interested to read happy to learn that he couldnt have been busted by that guys actions and told me that while he had fun he wasnt sure if he liked the leads attitude enough to camp with him again. So from the sound of it even though he had fun he was bothered enough to not be sure if he wants to return to their camp or maybe he was bothered by something else the lead said or did. I dunno we only talked about that one thing in regards to him being bothered by something that happened at his first burn. ,BurningMan,d7wnhme,1,t5_2qj68

Now you say that I wrote about a group you worked with yet you still fail to identify them. And you object to me reading your public Reddit posts to try to figure out if I know you? You have not done a very good job of discrediting the information I am presenting in the video that is the OP.

The things youre talking about charging dont even take that much power. You can get solar powered LED light strings designed for outdoor use that are as easy to set up as solar garden lights. Your phone and vape device probably charge off of usb so you might even be able to get away with just bringing a big USB battery pack depending on how much recharging you need to do during the week. ,BurningMan,de15qdy,2,t5_2qj68

11560246,0,t3_64zyw7,I understand that feeling. However I can say that Burning Man has created a conscience that goes far beyond the time in the desert and the party it is known for. So much good has occurred in the default world because of it. I was at Standing Rock and witnessed that community transformed because of the Burners that were there. The domes were donated and erected by Burners. When the toilets disappeared overnight it was Burners that constructed the compost toilets. That is a just a small portion of it. For me and others I think we need to come together on the playa to re establish and re invigorate ourselves to go back out and join together to make changes this planet cries out for. It isnt always a party. It is where I discovered my people and that has influenced the way I see and interact in the default. th year for me. See you in the dust.,BurningMan,dg6cwpv,2,t5_2qj68
