However the turntable has a US style pin AC cord and Im not sure weather to plug it directly into the amplifiers powerouts  pin or into the v wall socket pin with an adapter.

1859870,0,t1_ckd0lfr,Here is the tough call.  Build your own with new parts or buy old and rehabilitaterestore it.  After do a lot of restorations i have to say I like dealing with new.Why?  Less problems with dealing with many different factors like rust missing parts that need matching knobs getting the look right find NOS bulbs because of one burned out bulb or replacing all the bulbs with upgraded matching bulbs  you tend to notice the yellowness of the older bulbs because of age and stuff versus very new bulbs less chasing one problem then after chasing another down the line never do that if you replace one carbon comp resistor  then you might as well replace them all because of temperature and age drift and sometimes realizing the schematic doesnt match what you got manufacturer changed the design but never made a new schematic.With new you can choose the level of component you want to use From the tubes metallized polyester capacitors and electrolytic capacitors all the way to the bigger more expensive items like transformers and chassis.  I have seen builds that make no economic sense to me where every component part was the best to each his own I wont criticize the builder on how deep their pocketbook is because they are pumping up the economy and it is a hobby after all and if they want too buy  NOS tubes sure...  Why not?l where If I were in the same situation would well as just bought a new Conrad Johnson or McIntosh tube amp instead.If you really want to get into it with some power then start out small and simple.  The Baby Huey and El Cheapo use reasonable tubes and components.  They are hard to beat for the power to price and will get you into a good start.  If you want simplicity and elegant but you wont get mounds of power then the KTELKT build I mentioned up there is a simple build and sounds great.And then there is the RH.  Contreversial in design and very easy.  It does sound nice but doesnt perform to what was reported by the designer power and frequency response.  The designer has been kicked off of most diyaudio forums because of his flame wars between other posters think along the lines of rpublicfreakout here on reddit but with words.  I have built a couple RH out of scrap parts for about  each this is with leftovers from other old amps leftovers from other builds and old rusted iron i either found in scrap amps or junk bins.  Add in some tubes you have and buy one to just get it going and wow ...It is just easier to start out with new and then slowly getting into restorations.  I did it the other way around because I am old and internet wasnt around back then.PS a good rule to follow is use the better components in huge audio signal path and spend your money on huge output iron.,vintageaudio,ckdb4vj,2,t5_2svvy

2338303,0,t1_cm0puw8,The speaker is a field coil speaker and they frequently had very high resistance across the voice coil as well as a massive coil thats part of the power supply to supply the magnetic field for the voice coil to operate in.  Thats why the speaker has  wires.Youve actually only got one big multisection cap the silver cylinder in the cluster of metal tubes on the right of photo .  Those rusty metal cans are the tuned coils that are interstage between RF and IF sections.  The squareish can Im not sure of but may be a power transformer choke or similar in a metal case.Based on what youve shown me all of this can easily be used again.  If you so desired you could disconnect the radio parts and use it as an amplifier or simply inject your signal by tuning to a dead part of the AM band and running your iPod into the AF amp stage. Obviously this has to be done AFTER you make it safe to use with modern components like electrolytic caps replacing the paper caps etc.,vintageaudio,cm0q6dh,1,t5_2svvy

2597115,0,t3_2pihex,your fairy godmother must love you. That stuff is a vintage hifi wet dream.Id stay vintage and local in your quest for speakers. Two reasons  speakers are often big and expensive to ship and  there is no way to tell which speakers you will like so with used speakers you can usually sell them again for about what you paid for them.What type of speakers really depends on what type of music you listen to and what you hear when you listen to music from an acoustical perspective. We cant answer those and you probably can only answer them vaguely at best to begin with.The stacked Advents as mentioned elsewhere would be truly retro and what was considered a killer setup back in the day.If it were me Id be looking for horn loaded speakers like old Klipsch cuz Im a klipschaholic.

They used to be equal with NAD in the into hifi stuff but in recent years have surpassed while Marantz and others have gone down IMO. They use quality components and a nononsence approach to good audio  less bells and whistles and instead investing in good quality designs and products for better audio.There should not be any loss in a DIN adapter. Just another way to get signal to the amplifier rather than RCAs.w  w is more than plenty. I wont go into it but higher wattage amps just have less distortion THD etc. at same perceived volume levels. This is the main reason hifiers like big amps. your car stereo even at full blast is only about  watts if measuring the same way as home stereo. They should run your Qs just fine and dandy.Im going to also try to talk you out of the Grado. I am not a fan. I dont think their styli are of very good quality of others in the same price range. Also their upgrade line is more of the same with less and less value. This is why many with SR headphones are quite happy and are not far from the upper lines. Cant say the same with other companies. Also sound on Grados is warm with some present highs and some loss in the middle  rich sounding I guess but I prefer the AT and Ortofon sound. I would recommend the ATmla.,vintageaudio,cppege1,2,t5_2svvy

Remember the speaker rating is the maximum amount of power allowable for a warranty. However it is beneficial to using a higher than rated power amp for lower distortion. Distortion is mostly what kills speakers not just high excursion. So your quest for a new amp will give you a better sound and not nessesarily more volume. BTW  your speakers are rated at  db sensitivity which is not too far of from speakers from the time. Many modern speakers are rated at  or  db due to higher efficiency designs and crossovers. However if youre having to tun up your amp there may be an issue with the speakers or amp. My first suspicion would be power caps or crossover caps. ,vintageaudio,csaebaq,1,t5_2svvy

Then buy a decent speaker kit from Parts Express like the Overnight Sensations.  You can build out the rest of your system with quality parts too.  But I wouldnt use this.

It will do this by having multiple sets of tap wires. The v wires will only utilize half the transformer coils or you can connect up the v wires and use the full transformer coil to get that voltage.Way cheaper to manufacture one transformer with multiple wire taps which you then connect to depending on your local electrical system. Than separate transformers. This type of thing would allow electronics manufacturers to use a single part and say connect in the v circuit for US models and just swap wires to the v tap for European models without altering the design or manufacturing process.No idea if thats the case.

9980148,0,t1_db8fehf, AAC is basically indistinguishable from lossless. Even  AAC has people struggling to hear the difference. ALAC is as pointless as FLAC is for all normal people. Its an extreme niche. FLAC cornered an almost non existent market. ,vintageaudio,db8fwpc,3,t5_2svvy
9980207,0,t1_db8fwpc,Its in the recording as well.  If youre listening to something produced in the last  years the difference is difficult to hear.  If you take a really well recorded analogue recording like Fleetwood Macs Rumours the difference between  and lossless smacks you in the face.  Of course younger folk arent usually listening to albums like that.  Theyre listening to things recorded with filters and digital this and that intended to perform on new devices and hardware.  Their ears arent trained or socialized to these great dynamic wonders of the past.  Not bitching about Millennials when I say that.  Thats their world.  I get it.,vintageaudio,db8g6o8,2,t5_2svvy

You are right though its a separate plastic housing solely for the meter with a clear plastic piece on the front and then a clear window from the faceplate as well. Everything up front isnt discolored so that can stay although Im not sure whats up with all of the light bleeding through. I may not have seating the meter graphic properly when I had it opened up. It also looks to have warped slightly over time so Im sure thats not helping.,vintageaudio,dbrilng,1,t5_2svvy

The suspension was missing its foam inserts the spindle was locked up and the arm was a bit floppy. I fixed all that and gave the dustciver about  mins with the random orbiter and some plastic polish. The good news is that it works. The motor mounts were good and the motor itself is dead quiet. I slapped a new belt and a Grado Black on it and its rotating at . which I can live with. A few more hours cleaning it up and it will be spotless. ,vintageaudio,df0zi0l,7,t5_2svvy

The front piece however lower right also had a little rubber washer grommetbushingwhatever placed on top. When I removed that the whole thing sat flush metalonplastic.I dont know if it was some oversight from the factory or if somebodys already been fooling with it. Anyway lacking similarly sized rubber bushingsgrommetswasherswhatever I cut some out of a piece of black rubber hose I had similarly sized as luck would have it.Damned if that didnt seem to do the trick. Other than some light friction kinda sound plus a click every rotation from the platter its now silent. Said noises dont seem to have an effect on the playback either.
