5120949,0,t1_cv2mzv0,Hype The GameSounds like the current state of affairs in the No Mans Sky subreddit except their entire vitriolic attitude is astonishingly based exclusively around a lack of a release date.,EverspaceGame,cv39lzb,2,t5_39aen

7015151,0,t3_4bi7jf,Last day of march is going to be a long few days but as long as they have base VR support in the alpha build it will be well worth it,EverspaceGame,d1bikju,1,t5_39aen
7442695,0,t3_4h702g,Did you back it at a level that includes Alpha Access? I ask only because you dont mention what level you backed and dont want to assume anything. Only those that backed at the appropriate tier or upgraded to alpha on their website  got an email with a code.,EverspaceGame,d2o6qwq,2,t5_39aen
7443666,0,t1_d2i5pes,just bought the alpha I havent received a key yet. It seems it takes a while a lot of people in the forums state that they have waited quite a bit. Hours a day...,EverspaceGame,d2oapvk,1,t5_39aen
7459595,0,t1_d2q2krb,And the sound...I dont know why but it screams impending doom to me.Maybe because it reminds me of Starfox also known as Lylat Wars in some countries,EverspaceGame,d2q3y98,2,t5_39aen

7610618,0,t1_d37023w,Use the hull for cover and you should be able to pick off the turrets. It is a waste of resources at this time though. They are best avoided.,EverspaceGame,d37adgo,2,t5_39aen

8955170,0,t3_52vauf,When I first started I played with a controller Logitech F and it felt very awkward. I ended up using a mouse and keyboard set up. If I had to point to anything I think its because the right analog stick controls pitch and yaw whereas in a lot of other games Im used to the right stick controlling pitch and roll. In addition the controls for the left analog stick also felt clunky to me because it didnt control throttle. Controlling updownaltitude with the left stick felt very unintuitive to me. The keyboard control treats movement as an FPS though to me that takes away some of the fun and makes it feel less immersive.Edit added what controller I used,EverspaceGame,d7o9zyz,2,t5_39aen
9015112,0,t1_d7vgoxd,Yea it seems you are right. If you only have one access key when you open a container you go down to  and you need to find two more keys to get back to  to open another secure container.,EverspaceGame,d7vh5n8,1,t5_39aen

9558293,0,t1_d9r7tbc,I always pull Outlaws and Okkar to them.  They dont fight the Okkar by default so you just have to hang out by GampB fuel tanks for the Okkar to destroy them to piss off the GampB and get them to target the Okkar as well.,EverspaceGame,d9r981v,1,t5_39aen
9865776,0,t1_dati6ns,found that the beam weapon is really good for defence shooting down missiles and drones but yeah  does feel fairly weak esp if you dont have many perks,EverspaceGame,datj7ly,1,t5_39aen

11603954,0,t1_dgazqng,damage reduction through armour is additive.  there is no logical reason to assume that damage reduction through infinite drift would suddenly be multiplicative.what is rather the case I assume is that from a coding perspective its easier to make it multiplicative,EverspaceGame,dgbbg38,1,t5_39aen
