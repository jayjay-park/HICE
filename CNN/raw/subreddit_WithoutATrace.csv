3217433,0,t3_2wzhha,Alice Fontier one of the attorneys representing Pedro Hernandez said there were more than  pages of information on the case in one box alone.Given this massive disclosure at this point in the middle of the trial there may be issues she said. We may need to recall some of their witnesses. We may need to move for a mistrial.The boxes were found recently at a Harlem police station that covers public housing complexes in the area prosecutors said late last week. The location is miles from the precinct near where Etan disappeared on May   as he walked to school. Etans body has never been found and he was declared dead in .The boxes contain police records from the investigation notes from assistant district attorneys who worked on the case and handwritten memos from a detective who investigated longtime suspect Jose Ramos who was never charged. Some of the information involves two informants who were working with prosecutors to try to link Ramos to Etans death. Other boxes contain missingperson posters records of people arrested and catalogs of files made by the original detective on the case.previous,WithoutATrace,covhlmt,1,t5_2x0wl

4009569,0,t3_36erzb,The missing lad would be a yearold man now but since hes never been located its hard to predict with any certainty if hell ever be found at all. Nonetheless the search for him continues and his mother remains determined as ever to find him.Nearly a quarter of a century has passed in the disappearance of Ben Needham but authorities in Greece and Britain are still doing what they can with the assistance of his mother. The Yorkshire Post reports that the new reward isnt the only big update in the case. In fact police investigators have been granted an additional  to continue searching for the young man. This comes as wonderful news to his loved ones especially since so much time and money has been dedicated to other missing childrens cases  such as the search for Madeleine McCann which has cost taxpayers more than  Million.When Ben Needham vanished his family was vacationing on the island of Kos  a fact that has shared comparisons with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann who vanished over  years after he did. The circumstances of his disappearance have led to speculation that child trafficking rings could be responsible for the disappearances of children who travel abroad with their families in Europe and worldwide.Kerry Needham the Bens mother has been a champion for her missing son. She has endured close to  years of uncertainty while reliving the days of his disappearance time and time again. Most recently she traveled to Greece to test the DNA of a man who may have been her longlost son. Unfortunately the results were negative. Nonetheless she continues to make statements demanding answers and pleading for some kind of closure in his case.My family and I will not rest until we uncover what happened to Ben and I believe that someone out there knows what happened to him  I would urge them to please get in touch with police.,WithoutATrace,crdbky6,3,t5_2x0wl
4120128,0,t3_37ul36,On October   William Bill Seiler went to the Carlton House hotel in Downtown Pittsburgh to meet Mark Alexander.  Alexander was a potential investor in Seilers plastics manufacturing business.  He spoke with his wife around  PM and she reported that he sounded happy and felt sure that Alexander would be able to help him out but that his father was the person that had the money and they were going out to meet him.  His empty wallet was found on the Smithfield Street Bridge just before Midnight.  This was considered insignificant because his wife stated that he always carried his money in his pockets.  Seilers car was found in a parking garage on Seventh Street the next day.  He left it at  PM the day he vanished and told the attendants that he expected to leave it overnight.  They noted that he was counting a huge wad of money.  His wife said earlier that day he cashed a  check and deposited  into her account.  Police were able to find the car after a clergyman called them because he received the claim ticket in the mail.  Not much seems to be known about Mark Alexander.  Someone by that name made reservations at the Carlton House cancelled them then called back later but there was no space available.  He did ask them to take any messages from the because he was expecting one important call.  Seilers wife called all of the Mark Alexanders listed in the phone book and couldnt find him.  Seiler was a gambler.  They found two newspapers in his car and one was open to show racing results.  Theres not really much information so I threw together a quick map showing where he was supposed to meet Alexander where they found his wallet his home and place of business.  ,WithoutATrace,crpx4jt,2,t5_2x0wl
