10766706,0,t3_5u0q2p,I dont know where the state is in this process but this would be a great issue for the Florida LP.  As a paddler I dont buy that we create any significant costs as we dont need many improvements.  A sandy beach is fine.  We already pay for some of the costs like parking.  Bike paths and even lanes probably cost far more than what a paddler needs.  As for environmental harm you probably do as much walking on the beach or grass.    ,lpfl,ddqi84j,2,t5_3ez3b
