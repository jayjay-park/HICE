851572,0,t1_ch0kjpn,Im not as confident as you are... If he isnt getting hired with the masters I think it unlikely a CC class would help much.  Places willing to hire people who just graduated will probably look for someone who did a masters thesis or similar using the mammalian cells.The OP says he already has strong lab skills so I really think he will probably has enough experience.  Can anyone comment on why not having mammalian cell culture would be this bad?  I would think that there were plenty of jobs out there that did not require it.That said I dont have a better idea... but Im also not very convinced that what you describe would actually help. Honestly it would make me think as a hiring manager why did this person after getting a highly advanced degree go back to a CC.  Anything requiring the masters is probably going to disregardlaugh at the CC and anything requiring the CC is going to not want to hire for being too experienced IMO.,biotech,ch12u2k,1,t5_2qyja
890166,0,t3_24aar5,In response to  GET INTO A LAB AT YOUR UNIVERSITY TO DO HANDSON RESEARCH ASAP. Choose a professor who does something you find interesting by the end of your freshman year. Read their papers then ask to discuss their research with them. They will then allow you to volunteer in their lab. This is what you want. Work hard in their lab and they will maybe put your name on one of their publications. Those  years of working for free will pay for themselves x over once you graduate regardless of whether you choose a job or graduate school after your B.S.Research experience outside of class labs is the single most important factor for companies jobs and professors grad school. ,biotech,ch5gs4p,4,t5_2qyja
955243,0,t1_chblpj4,So are you looking for something that can detect a specific antibody or just antibodies in general?Also is it really necessary to be autoclaveable? Im doing my rotations but one of the labs I worked in that I will probably join works on protein design and development of protein based biosensors is one of the things we do I imagine it wouldnt be all that difficult for us to develop a general antibody binder that with some of our collaborators could be used to develop a sort of pH paper like device for antibody concentrations. Or another avenue is to induce a conformational change that could be read out using FRET. The development of a sensor like this would probably be relatively simple however designing it to be stable in an autoclave not so much. Also if you want detection for a specific antibody that would require a unique design in every case. It could be done but would require more work obviously.,biotech,chcvbdt,1,t5_2qyja

2681852,0,t1_cn8l57t,gt In the late th and early st century biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse sciences such as genomics recombinant gene technologies applied immunology and development of pharmaceutical therapies and diagnostic tests.SourceNote the only type of biotech you are referring to here is pharma and so if we assume all these have equal share in the field then it at most is  not a vast majority. More so when we really look at the community right now its not pharma thats booming which requires larges amounts of cash for not only the patents but the legal departments to secure IP but is instead genomics and genetics. Consider international scale projects like the Human Microbiome  this is at the core of bioinformatics and large number of biotech companies are just trying to set themselves up to support projects like this because future research money is being invested far more in genomicgenetic questions versus funding pharma. There are plenty of resources that suggest your estimates are grossly over and simply illogical given economics but its funny to note neither of us are using hard sources maybe grabbing data on types of biotech companies traded on the stock markets. I really do not care though because I know pharma isnt as significant as you suggest yes they might have a large amount of the money in biotech but they do not have the largest sum of employees.,biotech,cn8mztt,1,t5_2qyja

3571816,0,t1_cpz7vod,Well tbh a masters in bio wont let you move up too much in biotech unless youre super lucky. If you want to do very well I would recommend engineering or a PhD in bio PhD probably being the most relevant in your case. Also you have to pay for masters vs being paid for a PhD so a masters doesnt make much sense,biotech,cpzexvm,1,t5_2qyja
3583000,0,t1_cq09swm,thanks for the advice. I want the MBA because I would like to be on the business side of biomed.

I also have secured myself a year long lab position for my th year of university at my universitys health center. I completely agree with you on the frustration of hearing someone say they want to do something when theyre .

4470913,0,t1_csu6ams,I really appreciate you taking the time to put forward such a thoughtful response. For a little more background on my situation I dont have any academic research experience but I have interned at a large pharma company and gained some techniques there over the course of a summer. I hold a . GPA and Im a biochem major as well. From what Ive heard this masters degree is best for someone with little lab experience and wants to gain these skills before joining the work force. given this do you think its wise to pursue the degree to gain a wide set of skills and then begin to work or learn these skills in an industrial setting and later apply them to a potentially more competitive program? Thanks again. ,biotech,csu8dnd,1,t5_2qyja

8448325,0,t1_d5xidl0,Thanks a bunch good advice.  I made a MLSC account and am exploring MassBio and Biospace.Ive been networking and emailing people in the meantime through both LinkedIn and my alma mater networking and have some informational interviews lined up.  Is calling and inquiring about available internships particularly detrimental?  One company Im looking at asks that interested individuals get in touch with them but has no application forms It seems to me that calling andor emailing that company is the correct way to get involved?  I only have rd degree connections to anyone in that firm on LinkedIn.  My strategy was to express an interest in the field and the firm politely inquire and accept if no internships were available and to ask if they have any referrals to other similar firms that might provide insight into learning in the field.   ,biotech,d5xkt1d,1,t5_2qyja
