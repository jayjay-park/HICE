6949909,0,t1_d13n46p,My post was written under the scenario that it was a formal alliance alliance is in the title of the post. I didnt know much of the details so offering protection for occasional light information fits under my belief that a loose relationship would be the best option.I dont see much of a problem in your scenario though. Being at the top of the leaderboard is a good thing. It means we know what were doing and were good at it too. We stay primarily on Serendia so if they want to be at the top of the leaderboards that bad they can switch channels if their skill is high enough. Not to mention eventually theyll hit the wall where they need a hotspot to be able to even have a decent EXP gain so for information they come to us assuming we have the information ourselves. If weve put ourselves out there and enough people want our information on the off chance they do start a war over the leaderboard spot which they still have a high level of fishing to get we can tell the guilds were talking to that were halting the spread of information until we are safe enough to continue. If multiple guilds have valuable information stop flowing to them then there are probably two outcomes.  They find a different source and find out things that way.  They get upset at somebody bullying us and offer their protection in which we give them exclusive info while they defend us until the war is over. If the guild that starts a war with is wants to grow they wont waste their time bullying us while we personally foster the fishing growth of an equally large guild.If we do have to fight without allies we can simply fish in safe zones as they kill their funds. The higher level assassins like Im building myself to be can track members of the AGuild the warstarters from the bar in Velia finding their location and killpester them so they arent even able to climb the leaderboards anymore. The easiest way to stop a meaningless competition like that is to prevent it from being fun or worthwhile for AGuild. They could channel hop of course but so could we and wed still probably be at the top of whatever leaderboard we go to. If you need to AFK fish safely just go to a safezone until you come back to the keyboard.We arent well set for PvP yet true but we do have money. Lots of it. There are training dummies in town to practice on for fighting experience and there a still viable builds for combat to be found on the internet. If we buy good gear we easily put up a fight or run into a safezone where we can fish for hours on end. I dont believe  anyone with worthwhile time would sit in one place stalking somebody until they leave safety. They also wouldnt get a good rep if they kept preventing us from leaving the safe zone by immediately killing us. That alone is enough to get players with good morals to come to our aid.Basically Im fine with a loose relationship in which we exchange some info for protection. Thats how it should be imo. No offical declarations. I also believe that being bullied on the off chance I think itd happen wouldnt be all that bad if weve established firm information roots with other guilds. Not to mention that in time well be much larger and much more equipped for when somebody does want to start picking fights.And Schneider should still be fine being a processing god. xD,freshcatch,d143ram,1,t5_3d6m0
