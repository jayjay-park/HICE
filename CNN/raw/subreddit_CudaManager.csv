251663,0,t1_cf6tzk3,Thanks for the quick reply! I was told to make a .bat file with D benchmark and run that a few times to test out the best config. Is that incorrect?When I set it to auto on my mining .bat file it seems to go to something like Kx. Again thanks for the help.,CudaManager,cf6u82s,1,t5_2zw2h
