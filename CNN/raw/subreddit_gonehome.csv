8057712,0,t3_4no6p6,I didnt get happy vibes either but I may have misinterpreted something. The second voicemail who was that left by? The super distraught  sounding message. For whatever reason I had the impression is was Lonnie asking for Sam. It was left sometime after Katie left her message regarding the her flight. She was saying you should have been here so my take away from it was the events unfold and you find out what Sam planned on doing but I dont believe she ever made it to her destination.,gonehome,d4lrh6p,0,t5_2y7ug
