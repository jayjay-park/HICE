9015917,0,t1_d7vk6n4,Ah yeah. Its a bit hard sometimes to get the shot you want but I like most of the ones I take. There are a few I dont particularly like but others seem to like well enough so thats cool I suppose.  Drawing is also lots of fun! D I like doing things in charcoal but hate shading it looks pretty awesome after but gosh darn it absolutely hate shading!!  Havent tried photoshop but suppose that would be pretty cool.  Assume there would be lots of cool things to do with it. D,nekado_wants_to_play,d7vkn0v,1,t5_3fzl1
