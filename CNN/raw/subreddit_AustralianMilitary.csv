3135722,0,t1_con0cfg,Yeah depending on the type amp severity of the injury. However going to Kapooka in your current state is a recipe for disaster. You havent even attended your YOU session yet you can still defer your application until youre all good.The way I see it you can either try to bluff your way through the medical but be warned the docs there do check joints amp mobility and hope you make it through Kapooka injury free or you could get yourself fixed properly before you enter giving yourself the best possible chance.Remember the ADF only know of injuries if you tell them  if you get fixed up properly before you get in you could probably get away with not letting them know.,AustralianMilitary,con0izw,1,t5_2xmxy

I dont think my appeal will get rejected it just might be a bit time consuming and teidious. I also spoke to dad and he reckons it happend when i was even younger around  or  years old not  so thats a positive but also negative in the sense that records will be even harder to find they might not even exist anymore.Cheers,AustralianMilitary,cqn371k,2,t5_2xmxy

5212415,0,t1_cvdgfzp,YOU session is a good place to ask these questions they arent grilling you here and are generally there to help  I looked to join the military after not finding what I was looking for from study as well I was turned away by psych for that reason I did a few different courses without finishing  So prepare to be able to present yourself well know why you studied why you left and then why you think you can commit to the military  they wont really care what you did they just want to see commitment out of you before they even put you into training this is all on assessment day so thats a while away  So until then get fit probably get back into a team sport as they also grilled me as to why I was no longer playing footy only stopped  years ago due to work but hey at the end of the day its all about selling yourself and making sure you look like you are what the defence force wants to spend money on  As for what to study outside the DFR website look at the armys website too get to know their ranks what ranks you are likely to be in your role who their current chief is who the chief of defence force is heck even know who the governorgeneral is as they asked me that too  if its got anything to do with the defence force they could ask you on your assessment day and this is the day that matters in terms of recruitment  Hope most of this helps I just typed this out off the top of my head so the structuring is definitely awful,AustralianMilitary,cveaeym,1,t5_2xmxy

When you pick your YOU session date the recruiter chat theyll have all this info on hand. You should also get an info booklet. Then it onto the next two stages and assuming you go all the way through you submit your unsw application after your atar not exactly sure on this but its done around the same time as general uni applications.

6886105,0,t1_d0ws26h,gt international relations degree  an interest in the bigger pictureAs long as international events are a personal interest of yours youll be set. Aside from the Armyspecific training that you cant really preparetrain for the big part of the job is just having a good grasp of whats going on in different regions. You might be given a week to do an update brief on Syria its a lot easier if you already know the background know the different parties know the battle rhythm of the region etc.If youre successful with your application try checking out some of these sitesgt gt gt Anything by The War Nerd gtFree articles from Stratfor for the strategic level views are pretty good too. The Army has a subscription so you can check out the paid content when youre in. And Id recommend getting into podcasts so you can just increase your skillset while youre sitting around answering emails and such. Good quality ones like Reuters War College the War On the Rocks discussions Even Gary Breacher does some that you can check out on Patreon.If that stuff interests you youre golden. Show up to the Int Battalion with some good understanding and theyll love you. ,AustralianMilitary,d0wuuts,2,t5_2xmxy

If its available and you are offeredapplication accepted for it. Its not a guarantee and your battalion has to be offering the course at the time you also may or may not go into the Assault Pioneer PlatoonSupport Company even if you do the course it just means your capable and qualified to do so. The role of an AS is that youre a rifleman first however you will be also used as a combat engineer second essentially your a rifleman who is also a combat engineer filling sand bags sanitising water purification etcIf you want to go infantry go for itIf you want to go CE waitVery simple mate itll take you a long time to get a corps transfer with a lot of bullshit in the mean time.,AustralianMilitary,d73wlgd,1,t5_2xmxy

11091657,0,t3_5ydock,I can only presume this is an online presence of the actual shopfront Defence Clothing Stores in some base areas e.g. Irwin etcIf thats the case then yes Reservists are absolutely entitled to use this service. In my experience the warning part at the shopfront was enforced by presentation of your ADF ID and it being recorded against your PMKeyS that youd bought a certain item.Occasionally you fuck up your polys at a dinnerfunction whilst on the piss or you lose a hat badge or your cams get torn to shit by that training area and you need new ones etc. Id be very surprised if theyd started to restrict Reservist access to clothing stores.I think those warnings are more for civvies who want to collect shit and dress up like that Commando who got sprung at Maccas.,AustralianMilitary,dep89v5,10,t5_2xmxy

The reason for this is the poor mindset from senior personnel in the engineering community and STG that we are the Navy as we use things as we see fit.The reason Tobruk was so successful postyasi was the ship was given the proper amount of funding for maintenance activities which had been insufficient given the constant expectation of decommissioning and a core of experienced and knowledgeable technical sailors which were posted to the ship for many years without any shore respite.,AustralianMilitary,dfi00xu,4,t5_2xmxy
