6395054,0,t3_42z2yi,Now this is good storytelling. I missed the way that Roche uses their language. He makes them sound more like full fledged alien robots than almost any other writer. And I love how he mixes things in with the past stories. I have nothing but praise for this guy. Well aside from the part that he kills of really likable characters. But other than that this is just an awesome series,idwtransformers,czgjvfx,3,t5_344i1
6860010,0,t1_d0tdbuz,Bluestreaks bio always has him as the traumatized sole survivor with a pathological hatred of Decepticons. It hurt but it made sense. It actually makes sense for anyone. If you replaced Megatron with any human version of historys greatest monster wed most likely feel betrayed and be standing on the ship. Credit to Roberts for doing such a good job getting us consistently on Megatrons side. ,idwtransformers,d0tw3gs,4,t5_344i1

7531074,0,t3_4hiu8v,I dont really see that first image of Tarn looking up to Megatron as being indicative of anything in regard to his real identity. I see that image as Tarn slouching down and  aggressively getting into Megatrons face as he has his head hung in shame. ,idwtransformers,d2y8vr9,1,t5_344i1

8712196,0,t3_4z9xqz,Its popular among TF fans there for sure but I doubt that the print comics are releaseddistributed in Japan as widely as they are in the US in Europe hell even in the Philippine or Singapore as in my three trips to Japans otaku hotspots Ive never seen what is known in the West as a Local Comic Shop.The closest I suppose was a store called Hero Gangu in an street known to locals as Den Den Town. An entire side of the second floor is devoted to Transformers including a magazine rack of individual IDW comic issues at some crazy import prices. My guess is that theyre read and then resold by the owner of the store then again if youre crazy enough to make your employee uniform jackets match Rodimus color scheme I wonder why theyd be reselling the comics.Check out the pics in their entry on Google Maps.,idwtransformers,d6unt4q,1,t5_344i1

10029573,0,t1_dbesffu,I could be wrong since its been a long time since I read AHM but I think only Megatron Starscream Thundercracker a handful of Autobots and humans really get much of the spotlight.  Still a solid read and great starting point.  Edit  Deleted the original post since this was meant to be a reply.,idwtransformers,dbevq8x,1,t5_344i1
