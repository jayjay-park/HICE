2754533,0,t3_2r95qk,Wii games good ones at least  have more lasting appeal and replay value than a lot of other games  so people are less willing to part with them.  The thought process is I like this game and wouldnt mind keeping it for awhile  but I guess Id sell it if someone was willing to pay a lot for it.Its the same reason youll see newly released games listed for so much Im excited to play this  but if someone is willing to pay a lot for it  Ill sell it instead ,99gamers,cnh6fxp,1,t5_2ubsa
