There are a few market factors which could nudge prices up a little but overall you wont see an entire industry colluding to fix prices at unfairly high rates and it would require coordination to do so which is illegal in most relevant insurance markets.  Anyone who tries will be undercut dramatically and eventually run out of business.But its more than just theory behind my claims.  Empirical evidence also suggests that if some part of the population starts behaving more safely insurance rates for everyone will stay stable or go down.

990252,0,t1_chghmxr,Instead of downvoting Im going to give you my take on this and see if we can reach a better understanding. Onboard the vehicle there are many sensor systems which collect local information around the vehicle. Fusion of these sensor systems forms a virtual map of the area without considering the input from any larger system tasked with traffic flow. So in the case of an accident the system handling what the vehicle actually does is the onboard decision making system relying not on traffic flow information but on locally sensed information. A server cant be expected to keep track of moving pedestrians because those pedestrians are only visible to the system when they are visible to the vehicle and are reported to the server. Likewise all the relevant information can be derived from the local area without consulting the server at all. It would be an amateur mistake to design a system which sends local sensing information of such high volumes to a server to process and expect a decision in realtime. Not only would it be slower and less accurate it would be significantly less secure and far more vulnerable. Imagine youre driving down the highway at mph and you lose connection. What will your vehicle do then without a system on board to make the decisions? Can it be expected to pass control to a human for the th of a second the connection went down? What about for a whole second? ,SelfDrivingCars,chgukgy,1,t5_2udmw

When one party is pushing back on another that implies they have some kind of leverage over the other by taking some kind of action that would negatively impact automaker profits should automakers support selfdrivingcars. Im just saying big oil has no leverage on Ford and GM. I may be wrong thats why I left it open for someone to correct me if Im mistaken.,SelfDrivingCars,cjkrp5z,1,t5_2udmw

2106624,0,t1_cl7eyh1,Perhaps but Ive seen no indication that this is the case.  Volvo is not currently trying for level .  Their system is also going to be dependent on VI communication which is not scalable and is impractical for a level  vehicle.  Yes their location in Gothenberg is going to have more opportunities to be tested in adverse weather but that doesnt mean they will be.  By depending on VI or more likely handing back responsibility to the driver they will remain as far behind Google as they are now.It is also worth mentioning that Google is hardly isolated to Mountain View or California despite being headquartered there.  They have a great deal of projects and staff that are of global scale not the least of which is the fairly relevant street view which has adapted in a number of forms to cover a wide range of geographies and environmental conditions.  Google has a fairly clear goal which is get level  working in all conditions including weather conditions.  There are other challenges than weather which they seem to have prioritized first such as identifying and avoiding people.  They will undoubtedly tackle the challenges of adverse weather boldly assuming they have not already started and that will certainly involve testing in more extreme locations.I hope to see more from Volvo as they are taking the technology more seriously than most auto companies but I think it is unwise to assume that because they are doing their research primarily in Sweden that they somehow have an intrinsic advantage over a mildclimate oriented competitor.  Their technology and research is inferior to Googles and their announced pipeline is less ambitious so I would have to disagree that they are more likely to bring a fully autonomous level  car to market that can handle all weather conditions.  You also used the term autopilot which like Tesla and others they will certainly beat Google to market with some autopilot features but it will not be level  and as such will hand responsibility back to the driver in truly adverse conditions.,SelfDrivingCars,cl7litu,2,t5_2udmw

2898529,0,t1_cnxjma2,First off thanks for reading my huge post.gtI agree that the report is rough but we come at it very differently. Youre arguing that the tech will catch up and the authors are saying that this is not a given. I could take any of your claims and attack them.their claims are no further supported.gtGoogle has been asked what kind of bandwidth this requires to do overtheair for every vehicle in America. They havent said and I expect its not feasible with todays tech.full point cloud updating would be very bandwidth expensive but uploading temporary BSPs and relevent metadata would be very very lightweight.gtIt also takes multiple passes to build a map in order to distinguish a person who shows up once with a tree who shows up every pass. But thats nitpicking.Easily solved and is just a manpower cost.gtIve heard that number a lot but only once have I heard time between human takeovers.While I agree the time between human takeovers is more indicative of the SDCs capabilities it is foolish to assume the system they use does not learn from each and every takeover and mile driven. So while you and I only learn from each mile we drive or experience their system is capable of analyzing many many more miles driven than us.gtIt wasnt clear if the vehicle knew a takeover was needed like coming up on construction or it was unplanned like it was about to crash into something unless the driver intervened.no information given.gtThats why people dont put a ton of faith in the  mile figure because it doesnt mean much without knowing about the human interventions.obviously that one figure alone is worthless but it does point out one thing the SDCs will have much more data to learn from than any human driver possible could.gtBut we have the same argument. Either the tech will get exponentially better and solve all these problems in the next  years or it wont.I find their third conclusion insufficiently supported and FUD speculation.Their first conclusions is obvious to anyone looking at statistics but glosses over the possible enormous reduction in mundane accidents easily avoided.Their second conclusion seems intentionally limited and serves only to cast doubt. Autonomous systems have been significantly outperforming humans in many applications for years including tasks by highly maybe even excessively trained individuals. We have had fully autonomous aircraft landing on carriers for probably twenty years now.Fully autonomous flight is relatively easy.The current issues with SDCs is in sensor technology we have nothing that pierces snow or rain well at the ranges and speed we want. Everything else is dealing with the unsafe manner in which people are accustomed to cars operating. a significant number of people drive like lunatics in inclement weather and pressure others to do the same.,SelfDrivingCars,cnxkglg,1,t5_2udmw

2914364,0,t1_cnyrb8b,I didnt mean to offend you or put words in your mouth. Its right up there for all to read that you didnt say it had to be perfect. I was simply trying to point out that the goal isnt perfect its better. Perfection is after all a direction and not a destination. What I meant about the eyes is that weve made windshields wipers defrost and a number of other improvements to the vehicle to assure the highest confidence in the visibility of those sensors. They dont tend to just shut off and our brains are great at compensating when one does. My point is that weve invested a lot of money and engineering into tackling the problem of visibility for eyes so why not other sensors. My design takes advantage of that and places sensors in the cabin behind the windshield so if you cant see your car cant see either. Personally Id be absolutely ecstatic if we could get the number of traffic fatalities down to the unbelievably small number of gun deaths I believe with a little elbow grease and the power of thought we can save so many lives without taking away anyones rights or property. Id love to pm about reasons we shouldnt ban guns if you wouldnt mind hearing them. Cars are machines and when your engine or radiator or a tire goes out youre stuck just the same and you get a hassle. I cant imagine people treating the car with sensors any differently. If it stops working call a tow truck like you would any other time. No need to just sit in your car for days waiting for it to magically start working again. You dont do that with tires do you? Perhaps we would even have a replacement if a sensor goes out that you could just plug in and be on your way. Of all the problems your car could have thatd have to be the easiest one to solve. No one expects  confidence on every reading of every sensor. In fact the camera is a d sensor array and we dont even expect that great of confidence on each one individually. We dont need that kind of precision either because if we relied on it our algorithm wouldnt generalize well. If you only have one sensor on a given zone and it goes down youre not a very good engineer. Typically youd use a failsafe sensor system like an array of ultrasonic sensors around the car which are tied into a separate system and functional at all times with their own battery. Its really simple to say if something is close enough to trigger this sensor stop the vehicle. We engineers are very clever people and masters of redundancy because were quite keen on actually making things that work. As for the probability of collision we only have the human to beat and its a quick calculation to find out if that probability is lower or higher than a human driver could accomplish even with some sensors down. ADAS are absolutely human oriented by the very name. We havent gotten to fully autonomous yet on the mass market. Luckily there are levels of autonomy so we have some space to work these mixed systems in and we wont move on to getting rid of the steering wheel until were confidence we can always outperform humans which Google already has. Typically engineers dont take what they do lightly. A failure on our part can lead to high costs in both property and lives. Thats why we go to great lengths to get it right.

Im not talking a  car Im talking a  Audi or something. Dont want to get slammed around while trying to eat your icecream? Well you better have a good suspension dont like occasionally looking up at the world and notice your crawling past a huge line of manually driven Semi trains? Better have a engine you can manually take over and ease your peace of mind. Then there is what the bulk of car purchase choices are centralized around styleprestige.Now if you want to chase the racecar edge of performance meh thats easy. Penis enhancer is pretty much going to be those cars only purpose. Unless of course something weird catches on like hacked cars or something more fit for fiction than idle speculation about something we can only hope for.As for taxies? Meh they seem driven by whatever you can buy cheapest per fleet though then it gets more specific when  you talk tiers of cabbies. So Id expect to see the top end cars floating around here and there in that range too.Not everyone will want to roll up in a SDC fleet car as with the car rental.gt By definition getting from point A to point B on a route in less time requires a faster average traveling speed.Yup.gtAccelerate to and decelerate from your cruising speed more quickly. This requires higher acceleration which youve said isnt required.Never said that.gtStop fewer times. Unless youre going to run stop signs and lights this isnt an option that can be improved by a performance vehicle.That one can be done in a normal vehicle but not at the same efficiency better braking better overall handling. Remember SDC gets many many more control surfaces than you.gtIncrease your top travelling speed which is generally set by a speed limit at a rate that any car not just a performance car can maintain.Top speed again? gtAvoid traffic that might slow you down but you said weaving in and out of traffic was not required.Answered that above.gtNot slowing down for turns and other things that you would otherwise slow down for but again this creates an uncomfortable ride for passengers doing other things which youve said would not be the case.Not slowing down does not equal being able to take corners safely at a higher average rate of speed you are obsessed with speeding arent you?

4542283,0,t1_ct2vywk,Not to mention one of the reasons trains and other forms of mass public transportation sucks is because of the last mile.  Most comfortable trains get you close to where you want to go but not quite there.Example Im in San Jose.  I want to go to San Francisco.  Id prefer to take the CalTrain which is fast and efficient.  However that requires me to get to a CalTrain station which is only accessible via a slow local rail line or park my car at the CalTrain station and pay parking fees assuming I can find a spot.  Once I arrive I need to get to my destination in SF which necessitates using a bus system with a notgreat schedule or paying for an Uber which is pricy because of human drivers.End result I take the car.On the other hand if I could get an electric taxi on the cheap to my door which drops me off at the train station right on time and have another one pick me up EXACTLY as I arrive which takes me where I want to go and the entire thing was booked and paid for via my phone I would do that.People will take the path of least resistance.

With the work that Mobileye is doing with cameras and neural networks for autonomous vehicles and the fact that Facebook can already identify people in pictures better than humans for example among other similar developments leads me to believe that with the progress of faster processors improved neural networks and shared training data among autonomous vehicles that something along this approach may come sooner than later.,SelfDrivingCars,cx7hg3m,2,t5_2udmw

In the video I posted above it operates completely autonomously and you could add a zillion more cameras radars and sensors and it wouldnt do any better.  Redundancy is the key word.  The human overseer is there to provide it now and later more camerasradars will do what the human does now  add redundancy. So those  million miles a day are a complete source of information with no players missing.  Everything learned now will be fully transferable to a system with more hardware.

7357032,0,t1_d2duohr,It all comes down to the size of huge right?  If the a company has to spend  of its revenue annually on maps thats probably within normal operating costs.  If they would have to spend  of their revenue then youre probably looking at something that would put a strain on the ability of the company to cope with the costs.  If they had to spend  of their revenue then it would probably be impossible for the company to operate under those conditions.  So it really comes down to the cost of the maps and the amount of funding available to the organization.  I would suspect that the big car makers wouldnt have a problem dealing with the cost of paying for other peoples maps.  But if the maps are in the s of millions a smaller startup would probably find that daunting.  If we assume that the Google map cost is high enough that other people are willing to take on the enormous cost of mapping then it may be that the cost comes down.  But if the alternative mappers are the big auto companies they may decide to keep their maps as proprietary technology and not sell at all or they decide to pull a move like the airline industry and collude to keep the map costs high.

8684204,0,t1_d6qxmme,Signage wont be a problem because signs are specifically designed to be easily read. For one thing they have unique shapes. For example no recognition system is going to not understand a stop or yield sign. In addition if cars are fully autonomous they will be connected to a database. That database would make signs unnecessary since that information would be in the data. Finally a lot of the criticisms I hear about self driving cars cite unique environmental problems. The thing is that self driving cars can be made operational around main population centers that are constantly traveled and thus highly monitored. Any anomalies will be reported. That information will be analysed and distributed to every car in the area. There simply wont be any surprises because any road you go down will have been recently traveled by s to hundreds of cars before you.So sure SDC might not work on little traveled mountain roads but they dont have to in order to cover a large portion of the population.

9076895,0,t1_d82phqc,Its not just drivers jobs being affected. This will have a very widespread affect through many industries. The specific company I work for isnt the kind that will be able to use selfdriving trucks but were watching this very closely. My guess so far is that Walmart will be the first large fleet to convert. Theyre working pretty hard on this and are very well suited to take advantage of selfdriving trucks. What it looks like so far is that one driver will become a fleet manager and will be responsible for a convoy of  to  or so trucks. The actual number is a huge guess right now though.Truck stops are going to be hit the hardest since they will be losing most of their customers. The companies that provide products and services to those stops will be hit as well. Motels are another area that is going to be hit. Some drivers do love living out of their trucks but many do get hotels on a pretty regular basis. They stay in the cheapest ones they can find usually so your small momandpop motels and chains like Motel  will get hit the most.Also keep in mind that China can D print a house and have it fully built in just a few weeks. When that tech gets here its going to really hurt the whole construction industry and the loss of jobs will be widespread there as well. Thats going to hit the lumber industry really hard.I dont know of any sane person whos fighting against these technologies. Theyre coming just like they always do. The difference here is that for some time weve been losing bluecollar jobs to automation and outsourcing overseas and they are not being replaced by new jobs that these same bluecollar workers can do. Of the ones that do find new jobs many times they end up making less than they did before.Generally when technology causes people to lose jobs the new jobs that appear are ones that require more skills knowledge or talent to do than the old jobs. Were at a point now where there really isnt much left for these people to do.

I recall once upon a time Tesla tried suing Fisker and they lost the case I predict it will go the same way. At the end of the day people on the autopilot team havent been given the chance to implement all their ideas so I bet that this company doesnt actually use any of the tech that Tesla has got. ,SelfDrivingCars,dcycmi7,11,t5_2udmw

I still enjoy participating in motorsports but I think in such a future I would happily relegate that to a special car I dont drive daily.As for legality I think well see a mixed bag different requirements for different places needs.

10642175,0,t3_5s6d8a,I use to work for FedEx as a courier. Very negative place to work. Management pushed very unethical and unreasonable policies to get you off the clock ASAP. Like Conveniently moving the timeclock away from the front of the building to the very end near the meeting room to save an extra minute per employee. Trucks MercedesBenz Sprinters and Freightliner W and Ws and GMC vans are huge pieces of shit and the company does little to adequately maintain it. Truck broke down and stopped working on the highway before. I almost had someone rear end me at mph because of it. Ive heard stories of other drivers crashing cause problems with truck and the company fought it and said that it was the Drivers negligence. Its no wonder why all of the veteran couriers are very pissed and unhappy. So this is actually good but hopefully they can maintain the autonomous trucks a little better.,SelfDrivingCars,dddnqbe,2,t5_2udmw
10654672,0,t1_ddesra6,First I think youre overly dismissive of the possibility. These systems dont really even exist yet so its hard to say how securely theyll be implemented.  These guys are already hacking internet connected cars and current cars arent nearly as computer controlled as selfdriving cars will be. Additionally I used  in my earlier example for a reason. There will be lots of different makes and models of cars on the road likely each running different variations of the software. All it would take is hackers finding a vulnerability in a single model to wreak a lot of havoc. WayMo may be completely safe but are you going to trust every automobile manufacturer to do everything right? Additionally hackers dont usually have their own nuclear power plants power grids or communication satellites to take apart and analyze but its totally feasible for a hacker to get their hands on a car.Second Im not really trying to make the case that self driving car security is a huge threat. Im more trying to make a point about the politics of fear. Back to my original point about power plants  yes nuclear power plant meltdowns are a thing that can happen but way more people die from mining coal and natural gas than have ever died from nuclear meltdowns. Yet despite the statistical safety of nuclear power people are more willing to use dirtier less safe forms of power out of fear of meltdowns.You have a large population of people employed as drivers who are going to look for any excuse to keep their jobs relevant. Combine that with a hazy threat of a major catastrophe and youre going to have a lot of fear and misinformation around selfdriving cars. Overcoming that will take more than being statistically safer theyll have to be so much safer people look like idiots trying to paint them as riskier than human drivers.,SelfDrivingCars,ddey4bs,1,t5_2udmw
10756953,0,t1_ddp9ojy,I disagree obviously.  Anything that requires government intervention and cooperation between competing car manufacturers is going to move more slowly.  And theres limited engineering talent.  After they start releasing in California for good weather driving they arent going to put that talent to work on traffic mitigation theyre going to try to get it working in worse weather conditions.  For example.  gt Bad congestion means people dont want to drive cars car manufacturers will be eager to solve this.No that it is too much of a secondorder effect.  This is like saying that car manufacturers want to fight global warming because restrictions on driving will mean that fewer people buy cars.  Traffic is a big collectiveaction problem and very hard to solve.  It isnt worth much for one individual company to try to solve it since by themselves they can have negligible effect on it.  All the companies need to cooperate and that is extremely difficult especially when technology is changing rapidly and competition is harsh.  ,SelfDrivingCars,ddphzoo,1,t5_2udmw

10878780,0,t3_5vc3lf,Whats wrong with admitting that wed rather kill the people in the street than hit a tree? I agree that the trolley problem is a stupid scenario to bring up with SDCs for many reasons. But if the car does see a person in the street I surely hope it doesnt decide to leave the street to avoid hitting them. There is a such thing as an unavoidable collision so SDCs are still going to hit things. SDCs barely have time to scan the road in front of them I certainly dont think it has much time to scan the sides of the roads too. So the car knows less about whats off road than whats on road. Avoiding a person in the middle of the road could drive the car off a cliff or into even more pedestrians that arent dumb enough to be playing in the street btw or into somebodys house or who knows what. Under no circumstance should the car ever veer off road into an unknown situation just to maybe avoid killing somebody. If the car has determined that theres a human in the middle of the road and that the options to avoid that human would likely kill the passenger I say its perfectly fine to kill the person in the road. Theyre the least innocent person in this scenario and unfortunately they made a fatal mistake playing in the road.

Have the government decide how to actually certify L cars. Have the government certify their specific L car.This process will take at least two years.

I expect for most cases its simpler to go back to a human safety driver for a bit instead of engineering some complicated solution so you can e.g. have multiple LIDAR sensors in nearly the same position pointed in nearly the same direction.Eventually and once changes are iterative instead of major theyre definitely going to do as you suggest.
