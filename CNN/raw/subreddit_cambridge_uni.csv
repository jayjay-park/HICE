814445,0,t3_23gpfg,If its the only opportunity you have to ever go to a May Ball dont even think twice about not going. That said going with very few people is somewhat less fun but probably not so much as to make it not worth experiencing a May Ball at least once.  Ive been to Hughes Hall May Ball well we gatecrashed it by jumping a fence and it didnt seem that bad for its price. It was quite late by that point but they still somewhat had it going. But then several years of Churchill Spring Ball have somewhat lowered my expectancies for these kinds of events.  If you think you can bear going with the feeling that someone else should be there I really must recommend that you try to go that alone should be the deciding factor really.,cambridge_uni,cgwutu5,4,t5_2s17x
2941100,0,t3_2tuhst,Graduate or undergraduate? If graduate then it doesnt matter at all. The vast majority of your learning environment will be at your department. If undergraduate then you may lose out a little particularly if you want to hang out with  year olds. At a mature college you may have to work a bit harder to find a social circle. And you wont get to have meals in a  year old hall. But to be honest it mostly depends on your attitude. If you are a sociable person youll find plenty of college life outside of your college anyway in societies and other activities depends on what you are into. Also if you are in a small subject you may not find anyone else in your college in your department anyway. Its hard to say any further without knowing your age and subject but even then everyones experience is different.gt Additionally does the college hierarchy within Cambridge drastically affect the perception of your degree?No.,cambridge_uni,co2ezgy,6,t5_2s17x
3177770,0,t3_2tuhst,Are you kidding me? Its Cambridge yes its worth it. The mature colleges actually seem to have a better integrated community of students. Im at Wolfson doing an Undergrad and its fucking amazing as far as people are concerned.,cambridge_uni,cordhmb,1,t5_2s17x
3296802,0,t3_2xv7qz,Someone on a different forum asked the same question and linked to this cringe worthy letterwebsite Read at your own risk.To answer your question no I dont think you can unless you have a worthy reason where a different college can better accommodate your needs disability gender reassignment etc. As a graduate student the location of your college doesnt make too much of a difference anyway as your research will be based in the faculty. ,cambridge_uni,cp428li,5,t5_2s17x

6039954,0,t1_cybccxn,hahaha theres a few we dont stick together really though. I believe theres an american society but I feel the same way as you and didnt join it. Youll definitely get the international feel in Cambridge theres a fair number of europeans and other internationals as well.I think theres a lot of social pressure to meet lots of people which is just awesome,cambridge_uni,cybcku1,2,t5_2s17x

8860341,0,t3_51lq2m,dude its  miles cambridge is not a suburb of london. a taxi would cost as much as your plane fare.take the national express coach or train from heathrow to cambridge train is faster but would involve changing at kings cross then a taxi from the coach stoptrain station in Cambridge to your college for a fiver.,cambridge_uni,d7cvz5a,16,t5_2s17x
9238555,0,t1_d7zwmzk,I like the fact that its very science based as that what brought me to medicine. However Im worried I wont succeed let alone get in. Another problem is my school arent teaching as levels anymore. Does this mean they will focus on my GCSE results and a little on ALevel predictions? ,cambridge_uni,d8n1yx9,1,t5_2s17x
9642031,0,t1_da1kkuv,I applied to Clare the ones who got responses applied to Churchill and Kings. I wouldnt worry too much about when you get a response there could be a lot of factors that impact when a college sends them out.,cambridge_uni,da1kus0,2,t5_2s17x

11275835,0,t3_60x439,Am CompSci fresher.In first year youll take a quarter of your course as maths from the NatSci tripos. However theres two options. Option B which I take is generally slightly harder but covers the material in more depth and gives you a greater choice of which questions you do in the exams. Its recommended for those who did further maths Alevel and a reasonable amount of the course will be based on Alevel knowledge. Option A is supposed to be slightly slower but covering largely the same material.Quite a bit of my course is actually stuff I remember from Alevel FM albeit written a bit more formally and explained in a more fundamental way. Since the two options are based on the same core material its quite useful either way to have covered some of it before.The CompSci course more broadly does actually feature quite a lot of mathematical material partly a result of the course being very theoretical  youll have a Discrete Maths course in term  based around proof sets and regular language and the Algorithms module covers a lot of stuff included in Alevel Decision modules.So having Alevel FM will be very helpful and Id certainly recommend taking it if you can. Useful modules would be D and FPamp if you get any choice.,cambridge_uni,dfa3ldf,1,t5_2s17x
