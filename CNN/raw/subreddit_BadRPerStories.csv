3678577,0,t3_32i2yc,Ive never understood why people would cry for a DMAdminwhatever to not be in charge. When theyre the ones that made the damn site. If you dont approve that much go make your own where you can be in charge. Stop trying to take over something that isnt yours. But they wont because this one is successful and they want that specific one and not the new one that theyd have to put work towards.,BadRPerStories,cqbkyqq,1,t5_37a22

11624706,0,t1_dg8xo2k,Yep.. Straight talk in private.. Ask yourself Am I having fun? Will I have fun if this tool continues in this vein? Then either stay or leave to find better RP.,BadRPerStories,dgdo7hd,1,t5_37a22
