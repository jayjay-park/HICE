1051604,0,t3_264yif,DO NOT I repeat DO NOT! get Sprint!I made the mistake of signing up with Sprint last February because they offered Unlimited Data!...too bad you get absolutely no G or even G coverage in Northwest Ohio.Over the past  months my monthly data usage has been about MB a month! what good is Unlimited Data! if you can never use any of it?Also their customer service is a joke. I have had to call them several times regarding various issues and have never been treated as if they cared about keeping me as a customer. My latest ordeal involved me actually sending an email to their entire Executive Board. After an employee contacted me and was still unable to help me I sent another email to the Executive Board asking that someone who has the authority to actually help customers contact me and I am basically being ignored at this point.Regardless of how you or anyone else may feel about Sprint I recommend checking out rnocontract Tons of info about signing up with an MVNO and paying a fraction of what you would with one of the Big .Sprints coverage for calls is fine but based on your affinity for data usage I would stay far away from them!,toledo,chntlpl,8,t5_2qlrv

10992560,0,t1_de98hq2,Doctors are supposed to ask questions like this its not bias.If someone isnt sexually active at all a doctor will ask why they want birth control. Theyre not biased against celibate people for asking that questions.Its not because you were gay its because the information given to them at that point indicated you didnt have a medical need for it. They arent supposed to prescribe medication unless there is a medical need for it.All you have to say is the reason why.
