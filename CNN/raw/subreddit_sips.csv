361575,0,t1_cfi76aq,The thing is TB has an anxiety disorder. Its a real life medical condition one that I happen to share and it causes insecurity fear panic frequently appears with clinical depression etc. It is hard for people suffering from anxiety to have a thick skin particularly when theyve got such a massive following full of people telling them what to do and attacking them  like this in fact. You are calling TB childish and graceless and infuriating to watch as though this is at all constructive or helpful.As for your comment about everyone getting negative criticism in their jobs youre right pretty much everyone has to go through that. However Im pretty sure that very few people have to deal with it on such a massive scale thousands upon thousands of people all screaming at you at once all telling you to do different things and peppering it with personal attacks and insults like the ones youve said here. Each one of them thinking theyre in the right or that their voice isnt enough to hurt not realizing that these things pile up on a person particularly someone who is already susceptible to this sort of thing.I dont personally follow TB not my style of video but I will defend him to the death because I have anxiety too and I know how it can make you feel like youre caught in a trap that cuts you every time you move or speak.,sips,cfi8rf6,1,t5_2uts5

Itll be a while before you make it to that quest but if you dont heed this you could have to redo an hour or more of the same level If you dont grab the stuff when you try to leave you will die as soon as you fast travel Youll want your radiation resistance from radx to be at  before you enter.

3159850,0,t3_2wbt8f,Nice job finding the parts and saving before you fucked yourself over Sips!You want to head back to the ghoul dude now and hell give you some help on repairing the pump it requires you to use your repair skill. Read the books and then head back to where Harry is because if youre a dumbshit hell let you by no problemthe pump and the trapped ghoul are in the watershed area behind harry. Theres also another sewer drain there that you dont want to miss. Im glad you did get caught and explore that area though as it was a nice little preview of things to come. dont worry about going to the brotherhood to upgrade your intelligence. you were spot on when you said to take the mutate perk and then the gifted trait. Youll gain a  buff to all of your stats at the expense of losing  skill points from your skills. Luckily you get more skill points to allocate every time you level up by upping your intelligence so its not a total loss. that wont be until level  but Im pretty sure youll hit level  before you have the thousands of caps and prerequisite quests completed to buy another int stat. ,sips,copils2,12,t5_2uts5

3355280,0,t3_2ykibb,On March   scientists at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral Florida documented the first earthborne object to reach the speed of light.  Several thousand in fact.  What perplexed scientists however was the source of these objects.  We here at NASA have no spacecraft capable of reaching the kinds of speeds weve observed today.  So obviously we were quite confused as to the source of the phenomena we observed said Dr. Kathleen Dingus lead astronomer for NASA.  Then one of our engineers pointed out to us the date which happens to coincide to the release of Hotline Miami .  Suddenly it all made sense.Dingus continued We realized we were not looking at spacecraft but rather thousands of ripped dicks being flung at light speed velocity.  Obviously Sips had begun playing the game and given the difficulty curve and his inability to remember or even try to remember the controls such an event was inevitable.Dr. Dingus warned this could only be the beginning.  If Sips viewers have shown one thing it is that they have an endless supply of dicks to rip.  Obviously we are concerned that one particularly frustrated viewer may rip their dick so hard as to cause a localized black hole consuming our entire solar system in its pull.  Her advice?  We can only pray Sips never plays Dark Souls.,sips,cpaq605,10,t5_2uts5

4421864,1,t3_3bntyu,i kinda agree i wouldnt say that he has straight up lied to us though. for about a month now weve only had gta highlights and pirates. to be honest considering he was moving and on vacation i didnt mind the main content fallout cities and final fantasy being put on hold but hes been back for over a week now and all he has done is stream batman and put bulks of batman videos on his live channel. personally im not a fan of this format where sips will stream for hours put a bulk of about   min videos on the live channel and then upload a min highlights vid on the main channel. id prefer it if he just stuck to playing through the game and uploaded a min video a day just like what he was doing with cities and fallout for example.at the beginning of last week sips got back and did a poll for people to vote for what they wanted to see sips play here over  of people wanted sips to play fallout  the majority of which wanted it to be uploaded straight to the main channel rather than be streamed. however all sips has done is stream batman. i was surprised by this as i had assumed that he would prioritize fallout seeming thats what most people want to see. i understand that it cant just be what the viewers want it has to be what sips wants to play as well but why would he give the viewers the option to vote if hes just going to ignore the poll. i guess most people will see this and wont want to read it all as its so long but thats exactly how i feel when i see sips has uploaded almost  hours worth of batman in one day.,sips,cso2uzs,2,t5_2uts5

5626168,0,t3_3rkccl,How about Robocraft. Its an indie game where you build robots out of blocks kind of like Minecraft and use then to fight other users. Watching designs fail in spectacular ways starting out this will happen a lot would have a large comedic value. Im surprised no one has suggested this game yet.,sips,cwuha68,1,t5_2uts5
5676676,1,t3_3sta01,His YT channel is fine.  His streams are fantastic.  If anything his content output has gotten stronger.  His GTA and RDR streams are top notch and honestly only made better by the Twitch format.  All you miss is the fun editing sips would do every th video but you get much more immersive content.  Waiting for a  minute video every other day to continue a series is just shitty.I love his streams TBH and Ive only maybe caught  or  of them live.  As an American its not easy but VODs are a thing.  Its a bit lame when he plays Hearthstone with music in the background though because  of the VOD is muted.  Again though no big deal its still a metric fuck ton of content.Its gotta be said though.. its fine during shit like Hearthstone but sips whoring himself out by reading donations watching videos that people suggest and adding songs to his playlist is  frustrating.  Hat Films are the same way I want to watch them play a game and bullshit with each other.. reading EVERY donation out through  of their stream time is very annoying.  Pick and choose interesting donation questions and comments.  Reading generic shit like fuckmarrykill and I just want to say how awesome you are is pretty pointless.THAT being said Im excited for a FO YouTube series simply because its a type of video we havent seen from sips in a while since Skyrim really.  If he really enjoys the game and gets immersed in the world there really isnt anything else on YouTube that could even compete with a FO sips series.,sips,cx0qx4s,0,t5_2uts5

5679465,0,t3_3sx21a,the reason why everyone wants him to play fallout  isnt even really because of fallout  but because it has potential to keep sips intrested in just walking around whilst talking about random bullshit and making up stories about everything in addition to hopefully amazing editing like in skyrim. admittedly i dont want to tell you what to do or anything but i dont think watching sips for the sake of seeing intresting aspects of games is very good because he is so bad that your dick comes off in minutes. im not looking to sound like a dick and im genuinely sorry if i come off as one,sips,cx13e3x,6,t5_2uts5

I dont like the argument that he can upload them between watching his kids and what not because this is his job and you have to separate work and life. When his shift  is over its over. You have to pretend that he still works at the office and to go and upload something when something else is finished is not possible because he would have to drive all the way out to his office to do it.

The reason you are a bad leader is because you have the wrong idea about what constitutes a good leader!You are not a bad leader because you dont know enough you are a bad leader because you refuse to listen to other peoples opinions.Good leaders know that they cannot be experts at everything so they choose to surround themselves with experts and seek advice from those people example Obama knows nothing about war  police action  antiterrorism he has expert advisers who help him make informed decisions.You know nothing about being CEO or Community Manager so you hired Turps to do both jobs hope the T is getting double pay!.The point is good leaders surround themselves with experts because they acknowledge that one person cannot be an expert at everything.Edit Interesting that this gets downvoted here but gets upvoted on the main subreddit food for thought.,sips,d0aqtz6,0,t5_2uts5

6719620,0,t3_47jwde,So I just came home from dissecting frogs at the SCU sips memorial hospital and I wanted to watch some mr. bean in my new apartament. I got my beer from the fridge a joint and some fish sticks and got ready for a classic giggle. My disappointment was off the charts when I turned on the TV and saw nothing on it. I figured it was some sort of issue with the TV itself and bought a new one but no still not working. Then I called my friend from across the hallway who is studying LED television engineering at SCU. I felt the ground shaking underneath my feet when he told me that they dont have any signal on their TV either at scu. No one in the city does. There is no television no ads about fish sticks and noodles and this must be solved mayor.I spent some hours on bing and found out that this news station is expanding to new towns but they require a tower that sends the signal to the TVs in town or something like that again Im studying frog dissection so I dont know anything about that technical shizzlewizzle. I think that if you sign a contract to build one on top of a hill well all get to see Mr.Bean and Benny Hill running around on our TV screens and that would make me happy.,sips,d0ed7zy,1,t5_2uts5

Stand corrected seems like it did collect after all. but definitely need the other water collector. these one i find are good to put on other islands so when you go back there few days later you have water.Dragging the water and cooking it does not work any more it was temporary measure since boiling sea water doesnt make it more drinklable you need to build the two tier water still.

The only problem is you need the guards to reinforce your reign of terror so Sips will probably need to invest in body armour and tazers ASAP for when the extra crims turn up. Right now if one of them gets hold of a shank and stabs a guard the riot will get out of control. Which might be fun to see!,sips,d3nuu70,3,t5_2uts5

8155477,0,t3_4qxrxm,The door servo did not work because it is wired backwards hence the reason the controller says  servos connectedIn Prison Architect connections only work in one direction and you need it to be in the right direction for it to work. This also explains the previous issues with CCTV cameras.Also showerheads do not need to be adjacent to the walls. They can go on the ceiling. If you just remove the walls in the med sec shower it will work far more efficiently.Lastly your protective custody prisoners are starving because no kitchens are delivering food to that canteen. You need to go to logistics in order to fix this.,sips,d4wzdwp,3,t5_2uts5
8162307,0,t3_4r2k0z,Wow this was a dick ripping episode for me.  Lets have a look at those highlights! Wait that automatic door servo needs power? That absolutely gigantic kitchen Moving a prisoner to protected sec when hes in freetime so he goes directly to the shared chapel Giving the prisoners only one hour of freetime they can barely make it out the doors in that time Connecting the servos to the door timer then the door timer back to the servos just needs to click on connect on the door timer and connect it to the servos Moving crims to Supermax and back Ignoring the tunnel notification for a good two minutes it was a false alarm fortunately Not connecting the southern part of that new wing so its just three extralong corridors that lead to a dead end why not connect them? Putting a normal door on the kitchen with no metal detector eitherOne thing I do think works  although I dont do it myself  is making the canteen into a common room of sorts.  Crims will go and satisfy their needs when they have the time and opportunity they wont actually care what room theyre in.  Its why you see crims in the infirmary listening to the radio.And is that the original driller killer? Didnt he get eaten by the dog?Edit Grammar,sips,d4xu46x,40,t5_2uts5

I made my last playthrough of GDT with most of these episodes playing in the background and I gotta say sips sticks with one company much longer than I could. I made a triple a mmo trying to make the next world of warcraft named my company blizzard and everything and no matter how many expansions i put out they all got mediocre scores of  and . it was super disappointing and of course devoting all that time to multiple AAA expansions drained my nest egg. still Im glad I had the mmo running for so long instead of taking the money and running those virtual fans really deserved it.,sips,d6y3pnl,13,t5_2uts5

Im not overly familiar with the game but I bet there will be some good moments with sips at the helm. Ill have to watch this for sure. And I hope sips puts the vods on Youtube before Twitch removes them I think its a  day archive?.,sips,dcl5izw,2,t5_2uts5

10850024,0,t1_ddxl3s8,Kinda frustrating when it looks like hes asking the chat something then doesnt immediately get a response because of the delay then just makes his own assumption and goes on to do it rarely checking to see if its correct before its too late. Only to be corrected if someone donates which is often just a low bit donation with incorrect information in a desperate attempt to troll Sips and sabotage the run.,sips,ddz3q4j,2,t5_2uts5

11539223,0,t3_64npgv,Id reccomened the Sim City series. The picture of the hobo at the top aka paint sniffer originated in there. Sips used to edit his videos quite a bit and it was during the days of skyrim and Sim city that he did it the most. Action jackson. Paint sniffer. ah the good days.For random videos to laugh at id reccomend. sips never gonna hit those notes  tom the horse earth song its not me.Theres also a very good sips laughing compilation which is just  min of him losing it on random videos that the yogscast made the last  years? ?
