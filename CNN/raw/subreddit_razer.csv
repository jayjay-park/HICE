While running light processes expect . Notice how they give no indication of battery life on the Razer Blade info page nor the sales page? Yeah. Thats why.The resolution isnt k nor can that graphics card even handle games at the x resolution it does have. You will NOT be able to run games at max graphics at that resolution. I promise. A  screen with that high of a resolution isnt even noticeable remember the whole fiasco with Apple when they were boasting about their resolution on the new iPhones with Retina display? Yeah. The human eye can only see so many PPI pixels per inch and that number happens to be ppi at a normal viewing angle of about  inches. The new Blade boasts ppi. Anything above  is useless dick measuring and frankly is pretty insulting to consumers when they advertise those numbers and dont inform them. In short bring on the downvotes. I was only trying to help this guy out and give him a non Razer fanboy opinion of what he needs.

And they surely didnt put something on the contents list that didnt appear in the box later. Also you fixed it for  bucks. Whats the big deal here? looks to me like another issue when someone pressed the onthegomacrorecord button and now thinks his keyboard is broken. Check Synapse config if this key isnt assigned to something. Youve also surely checked the numpad functionality of your keyboard on a different PC before posting this right? Synapse isnt perfect. It has a lot of bugs and a lazy team of devs. Its definitely not terrible though and is pretty easy to use even for an average person from my experience. And if you find it hard to use you still have the keyboardmouse manual and... the ability to not use it at all.Also saying the drivers dont work is like trying to add an additional argument while not being able to think of anything constructive.By all means please dont buy anything from Razer ever again.,razer,cwlf3a7,3,t5_2ssha

6642622,0,t3_46gcv2,OP Here Obviously.To respond to a few things ive seen as replys here. Dont buy the first version of any hardware.Reponse Its a laptop mate they have been making them forever....faulty charging ports on many of the ones shipped based on their forums...there is just no excuse on a k plus device that your quality control is so low you ship out your first batch and something as simple as a hole through which power flows doesnt work. I would understand if it was like an internal issue cpu or gpu heat issues or something thats complex. A cable not going into the charging slot and flopping about like a fish is just plain I dont care people will buy it anyway bullshit.. Im impatient.Response Im not impatient at all. As a matter of fact If I would have just let them send me another one I would have had it within a weeks time. I was more scared of getting another defective laptop or that they would try to fix that one and send it back.. Reponse To galmsortieSo let me make myself clear. I was not impatient I was never rude and I never overreacted. I bought an expensive product that showed up broken I was disappointed but ready to deal with waiting a week for a replacement. I sent it back quickly and they responded to the RMA request quickly. The next day when it showed up at their facility I happend to look at the razer forums and a few other places to see that others were having the same issue as me. I made the judgement call that I didnt want to run the risk of after another week get another broken replacement and then have to return it then and get a refund. I simply called them and noted I had seen the item had been signed for by their receiving department and that instead of the RMA I would like to just go ahead and get a refund to which I was told no problem. A week went by when I got that first email that said your replacement is on its way! with a shipping address to texas...when I ADont live in Texas and B Didnt request a replacement I requested a Refund. I began to see a pattern with their company being disorganized and thats when I became panicked that this was going to be an ordeal. If even once I had gotten someone on the phone or through a support ticket after that incident that was like Were really sorry for the mixup Ill make sure this gets taken care of and heres the status of your refund which I never got in the slightest. I just kept getting yeah yeah your refund...that can take legally up to  days...and ill look into that shipping thing.Ive done business with AppleCorsairBenQDellSteamEA and a few other businesses over the years where I needed to contact their support and knowing that i just blew multiple hundreds of dollars on their product they atleast PRETENDED to give half a fuck. So sincerely screw you and your attitude of trying to paint me as an impatient idiot Im quite level headed and patient in these matters. It just becomes stressful when you keep getting told that  dollars of your money that is just floating around in nowhere land yeah thats coming back to you eventually sometime maybe whenever stop calling me youre bothering me bye .

7364179,0,t1_d2f5pf7,It didnt most likely. They just knew they could get away with it. But thats just guessing. Oddly enough some of the delays correspond to possible macbook pro refresh rumor dates. They got worried it could have been released in march during the conference apple held. When that didnt happen and the new Macbook  didnt get thunderbolt  they delayed it again. They really messed up releasing the stealth like this and they dont want to cannibalize its sales and the sales of the  blades by releasing this clearly better . If a refreshed macbook pro hit the streets you can imagine with thunderbolt  many people would jump ship especially if they buy the Core. Thats the only thing macs lackedtrue graphics and thats the form factor and style Razer is looking to emulate in a Windows adaptation. All in all they just want to sell a few more s and stealths before they put this thing for sale. Im honestly surprised how many people bought the stealth quite a bit underpowered i would imagine even with the Core as the CPU would bottleneck. At that price range even the Core M macbooks seem like a nice buy. ,razer,d2f98xg,1,t5_2ssha

The annoyances lie within the scaling for certain applications that run on Windows not the OS itself.Can you clarify the washed out comment?  The viewing angles of the razer blade  are spectacular IMO... especially after the calibration correction.

7809470,0,t1_d3re1yb,Unplugging the laptop is something that is not necessary. It wont drastically change the life of the battery. That was something that applies to some batteries that are not Liion. Even the site you linked says at the bottom The question is asked Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use? Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because charging stops when the Liion battery is full. A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level. Most users do not remove the AC power and this practice is safe.So I think realistically you can keep the laptop plugged in when you are stationary and have access to an outlet and only revert to battery when necessary.,razer,d3tujop,1,t5_2ssha

8129584,0,t1_d4tlxhj,Hey! So long story short I didnt do it. But I also havent gotten a new laptop yet. Ive been planning on building a of rig for while for entertainment gaming and heavy lifting work when I need it. Thats what I did first because it saved me . Since I had been waiting to see if hardware was to be announced at the wwdc which wasnt I decided the pc build was a better investment and helps provide a stopgap until the fall when the new mbp line up will most likely be announced. Im still planning on upgrading my laptop then though. My concern still is that price tag the investment issue that you share as well. So in the fall when the specs are confirmed Ill make my decision. If the gpu and cpu are solid for the price Ill stick with Mac because theyre gorgeous I love OS X and that trackpad is unbeatable. Now if thats not the case and the price is still lets say  higher for compatible hardware in the razer blade  Ill go to the razer blade. Ive heard nothing but praise for the build of the razer blade so I think that is a safe point. And two things have been confirmed now that I have home pc set up  I do enjoy OS X more than Windows  though I dont mind the difference and experience that I have in Windows  and  I think Id have a struggle switching away from the magic track pad of a Mac though doable I love them and they are my primary interface when working remotely. I could do it Im confident now of that but Id miss it for sure. In the end Id like to stick with macs also because I use the iPhone and plan on an Apple Watch next year but if the price tag is higher than what seems worth it for me personally Id be comfortable if not a little sad switching to the blade . Im not concerned with their build quality anymore really just if I had to worry about repairs I personally couldnt manage. I hope that long comment helps some even though I cant speak from direct use of the blade yet. ,razer,d4tu6qe,1,t5_2ssha

Theres no data that suggests either for or against this statement but there is always a slight drop in performance since your relaying at  GBps through a single port.

I simply disabled the Share feature in GeForce Experience and performance was back up to spec. I also had the very same problem where the keyboard became unresponsive in games. Solved by disabling share. I was right on the brink of returning the laptop but it looks like there is just some kind of software bug were looking at. Either with Synapse or GeForce Experience though Id wager it is Nvidias fault I have other odd problems on my desktop when Share is enabled.Its  solid now.

9928848,0,t1_db1qofm,I know that the X is the direct competitor based on GPU but based on build quality and features its not  the Blade handily wins. However at the Blades higher price points the X v is a direct competitor with several advantages. I simply dont see any competitor to the Blade in the  space. If youre budget limited youre not even looking at the Blade youre looking at the MSI and ASUS lineup around . So the Blade isnt competing there. If youre able to stretch to  the Blade is simply far better than anything else in the performance bracket due to the far superior build quality full perkey RGB lighting stellar p display better battery life and inclusion of TB with an existing eGPU solution for proven futureproofing down the line. Thus if you want to compete with the Blade you look at the higher price points of the Blade lineup and thats where things like the Aorus X v come into play. With a better CPU and GPU plus more storage options and RAM capabilities for the same price as a Blade its a definite competitor. Where it lost me was the build quality and the lack of Thunderbolt . For a product that starts at  it just doesnt have the build quality that bracket commands. Things like reusing the old chassis designs and just plugging the excess VGA and HDMI ports with rubber? At  thats bullshit. Things like MSIlevels of build quality where the keyboard creaks and flexes due to the thin magnesium alloy used in the build. Things like the fact that all of the reviews Ive read for several Aorus generations mentioned that the screen has terrible flex and wobble because again very thin magnesium alloy used. If they had Dell XPS or ASUS Zenbook levels of build quality and a Thunderbolt  port Id agree with you that it would wipe the floor with the Blade in everything. But it doesnt. It beats the Blade in some specs and loses to the Blade in portability build quality and future proofing. That means that theres a real competition here not a definite onesided victory like there is for the Blade in the lower price ranges. By the way Ive bought an Aorus X v ASUS GLVS and a Razer Blade  QHD this year. So Ive put more hours and cold hard cash into these things than anyone else here has. Ive definitely done my homework and know what Im talking about. ,razer,db1r5t4,1,t5_2ssha

10955038,0,t1_de8sx53,The only other suggestion I would have is based on a previous experience of my own where my Synapse profile stored in the cloud became corrupt. To fix this I had to uninstall Synapse reboot download a fresh copy of Synapse install and reboot again. When the machine comes back up and you launch Synapse do not log in. Instead click on the link to create a new account. After creating that account log in and then plug in your headset and let it download the necessary drivers etc. This will ensure that if your old account had a corrupt profile it doesnt get downloaded again... you would be starting fresh.If that doesnt work you should reach out to Razer Support.

10988038,0,t3_5wue61,That is indeed odd.If you can try plugging the keyboard into another computer and see if the behaviour continues. If the problem goes away on another computer then try uninstalling and reinstalling Synapse on your machine. If the problem still continues chances are your profile is corrupt in the cloud. In that case uninstall Synapse again but when you reinstall and launch it for the first time... DO NOT log into your Razer account. Instead create a new account and log into that. This ensures that if you have a corrupt profile that has been saved to the cloud it will not be carried forward.If none of this works I would reach out to Razer Support.

That being said you are loosing Quad Core CPU and dedicated graphics.
