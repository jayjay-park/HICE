7679511,0,t1_d3ey0ch,Oh wow yeah didnt see these bugs before especially the comment collapsing bug Ill get on fixing that today and pull the update from the AppStore till I do. A lot of bugs occur with switching between night mode and such mostly because the way I have the app setup is fairly inefficient for themeing. Ill try my best to fix the bugs where you plain out cant see text when switching back from night mode today and start working on making the comment composer be night mode. Thanks for everything!,Jump,d3f44mv,1,t5_2rnqr
