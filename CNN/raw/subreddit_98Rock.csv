10463979,0,t3_5pnst7,I have two reached out to a celeb stories. In middle school i got Avril Lavignes agents number off the web. I tried calling multiple times with some other guys at my after school program. But we never got a hold of her only her agent. I got in trouble later on cause at the time she lived out of the country in Canada. So it costed more to call. I emailed OMalley complaining how long the wait time is for a drivers test. About a week later he called back and gave me a drivers test the next day. ,98Rock,dcu75k2,2,t5_30upy
