2596246,0,t3_2ojajj,hmm. ILL try to tell how our teacher did before  Maybe you need a set of fake money for buying.  then form a group maybe  groups?  you have another piece of special papers that could be bought by those fake papers. Let them buy in a standard price if they wanna buy if not let them be. And since BTC can be dispersed into many bits maube try to make  special papers   BTC  Your FIXED  price maybe  usd?  Then  special papers   usd maybe?Then tell them to have as many special papers as they could by buyingselling ? doing some work? helping? tipping? gambling? betting? Our professor even said if you can steal go but maybe it depends on age? They can also be inactive so that no revenue will be lost nothing will be gained too.     Let them keep the money over night then next day its up to you if you will rise or lower the value of those special papers depending on status or news??  Do it until third day maybe? and who ever got the most special papers can have some great gifts? good grades in our case.,BitTippers,cmxgsov,1,t5_32yw1

After taking the test I actually felt confident and it turns out I got the A that I needed. Two days later the anatomy test came. The final consisted of  question and  of them were common assessment questions meaning that they were created by the state. After I took the test I was sure I fucked up. There was no way I got an A on this exam. Turns out I had the highest grade in the whole class with an . I couldnt believe it. But even with a  my grade turned out to be an ..

2817114,0,t3_2scmu5,I feel like fifteen years will go buy a bit faster than we imagine. Meaning that Bitcoin will still have its skeptics yet will only grow in usage and popularity. I see it being adopted by Amazon making online purchases much more efficient and common. That adaptability will be what opens up Bitcoin to a large audience and even the older population will find themselves having Bitcoin wallets through Amazon I can see it now CoinAmazon something like that. Even when something seems to make perfect sense for its usability in the future there is absolutely no confirming that it will be used prevalently years from now. BETA was better than VHS but the latter still won out. The good thing about Bitcoin is that its more than just a product like BETA or LaserDisc it could very well start to replace fiat currency in our lifetime e.g.  years. People seem to really be getting caught up on the fluctuation on price of Bitcoin but just as the stock market fluctuates considerably it usually will grow in its longevity as long as it is a quality itemcompanystock. In summary i.e. tldr I see people finding themselves forgetting their wallet at home more over their phones. Their phone will be their wallet Bitcoin their currency of choice and cashcredit will become where Bitcoin is now.,BitTippers,cnoart1,1,t5_32yw1

3200057,0,t1_cotoodc,ampampamp Casuarina sfw gtgtCasuarina is a genus of  species in the family Casuarinaceae native to Australasia the Indian Subcontinent southeast Asia and islands of the western Pacific Ocean It was once treated as the sole genus in the family but has been split into three genera see Casuarinaceae  gtThey are evergreen shrubs and trees growing to  m tall. The foliage consists of slender muchbranched green to greygreen twigs bearing minute scaleleaves in whorls of . The flowers are produced in small catkin inflorescences the flowers are simple spikes. Most species are dioecious but a few are monoecious The fruit is a woody oval structure superficially resembling a conifer cone made up of numerous carpels each containing a single seed with a small wing   The generic name is derived from the Malay word for the cassowary kasuari alluding to the similarities between the birds feathers and the plants foliage  though the tree is called rhu in current standard Malay.gtCasuarina species are a food source of the larvae of hepialid moths members of the genus Aenetus including A. lewinii and A. splendens burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Endoclita malabaricus also feeds on Casuarina. The noctuid Turnip Moth is also recorded feeding on Casuarina.gtgtImage from article iInteresting Electoral division of Casuarina | Casuarina Northern Territory | Casuarina New South Wales Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcotoor oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecotoor.

3392259,0,t3_2z0x7x,The Legend of LuckyIn another universe it began. Lucky the Creator  the Life Bringer began her preparations. She was ready. Too many centuries had passed and she was now weary. It was time for her Great Feast.All the Life Bringers gathered to Luckys realm. They celebrated the greatness and heart of Lucky. Great food great drink and great love was shared by all. The ceremonies came to a close and all left except Lucky. She was happy and a little nervous! Nervous She exclaimed aloud! She hadnt felt that since ... she could not remember the last she experienced such a feeling. She was now excited. The great sleep was coming and with it her new adventure. Lucky entered the garden. She lay down in the shade of her Tree of Dreams. The tree she planted with her family many ages ago. The tree she guarded nursed and communed with over her lifetime. The tree was filed with knowledge and memories Lucky had taught it and the tree was now ready to give Lucky her Creation Dream. She closed her eyes and moments later she passed on.There was nothing. No sound no light no stimulus nothing. Lucky was frightened! What had gone wrong! She had prepared her entire life for her Creation Dream but she had failed! Her heart raced! What was she to do? She had been cast into the Great Darkness! Despair began to creep into her thoughts! The terror was overwhelming! She could not make a sound! She could not move! The she felt them! She heard them! It was ... the Darkness! They were coming to take her! To use her a Life Bringer for the Darkness! To take love light and life from all realms! NOOOOOOO! She tried to scream but they covered her mouth so no sound escaped! She tried to kick and fight but they were too many! She felt their heavy chains across her back around her legs over her head and around her neck! Some chains were cold some were hot and some cut into her body! She felt pain she felt tears pour out of her eyes and blood escape her wounds. All the feelings she had not felt in ages.Then she heard it! The sound of water! At first it was just a drop or two. It was her tears! They landed on the shadows of the Darkness and dissolved them. Her tears of pureness of a good and honest heart were dissolving the darkness! She fought even harder now and she could hear distant oceans now she could feel the warm breeze of winds the warmth of a glowing sun she could feel the love and meaning of life. She broke free! Lucky drew her breath and she did it! She trumpeted her elephant call and it began! From her trunk came forth the light and life and love of a new universe. The Darkness was gone. Lucky floated in her new universe. She swam through the new space she had created. She lit billions of suns and spun thousands of  galaxies. She was ready for her next adventure!Lucky swam to a distant galaxy and found a pretty yellow sun. She let herself diminish in size and drifted towards a pale blue dot. It was there she changed her form to hard and small. She would experience this part of her creation as an observer hidden in plain sight. Her Creation Dream was wonderful and she was loving every minute of it!,BitTippers,cpey05j,2,t5_32yw1
