8626217,0,t3_4xw615,Id like to be able to search planets on the galactic map. That way if you write down a planet youd like to return to you can actually find it again. Or a path indicator in a different color showing you the path youve taken to get to where you are so you can easily backtrack...kinda like the path of atlas or path to the center of the galaxy but in reverse. Finding where youve been in this huge universe is too difficult! I often just move on instead and try to find a similar planet. ,NoMansSkyMods,d6jvpa1,29,t5_38zbi

Unstable and wont support a big database quickly.Fix your template using them isnt a problem but there are many bugs uploading page has misaligned columns Im assuming you manually added the Twitter feed as a colsm class? Replace the other div for uploading as colsm instead of  so it doesnt over run.Id work at coding the upload yourself instead of using a WordPress plugin back to point  about word press being unstable with a high user baseOptimisations these should have been done before launch and your website hasnt had even a fraction of the amount of traffic that would cause a slow down like this.

8740034,0,t1_d6xxycs,Im not making this up I actually did my masters thesis on terrain LOD Level of Detail systems and developed my own game engine. Draw distance is the maximum distance at which polygons will draw at all. Level of Detail systems are algorithms that reduce the complexity and rendering load of objects or terrain based on distance usually by swapping the terrain or object model texture or shader with a simpler or lower resolution version.The thing your mod changes is not the LOD system from screenshots it seems to be changing some variable that feeds into the placement code for terrain deformations such as caves and outcroppings effectively removing them and moving some other objects around as a consequence.When people say they want an LOD mod they are asking for stuff to pop in further away and switch to high resolution further away. Your mod doesnt do that so its not an LOD improving mod.,NoMansSkyMods,d6y5l8f,3,t5_38zbi
8757541,0,t3_4xw615,Id like to request. Speed up travel time to planets. Currently you just hold down the space button and it heads to the planet with the counter ticking down while you twiddle your thumbs. Either make it quicker or get there instantly. I dont know if this is possible but for those who just want to get to the planet quickly itll be helpful.. Stop the animations when you visit a new save site where the camera pans off to the distance when you visit a transmission tower and the camera pans to a birds eye view and when you visit anything that produces text the text that appears appears to be typed out as you read it. If any of these were quicker itd save having to wait for those tedious animations. Especially good for those that travel around from area to area quite quickly.,NoMansSkyMods,d70cnye,4,t5_38zbi

For instance gold aluminum and emeril all three use the identical green color.  Itd be cool if they were each a separate color instead.  And maybe like idunno aluminum or something maybe its crystal form should have a different shape than the others such as the one OP referenced.  Just some ideas. ,NoMansSkyMods,d8wcii5,3,t5_38zbi

9929597,0,t1_db1fysk,After reading your first post again Maybe your GOG version is not uptodate and you dont have the patch . yet.You should try to delete the MODS folder and delete the NOMODS.txt and just paste the MODS into the PCBANKS folder and see if that works.My thinking is this if you still have game version . initial foundation release then you dont need the MODS folder yet. If you really do have the v. installed then you wont get the Mod Support message at start of game but your Mods should work when you copy them into the PCBANKS folder.You can also try to start the game as administrator to make sure your game has access to the files depending on where you installed it windows might block some file access. unlikely but try it if nothing else works,NoMansSkyMods,db1uo9o,1,t5_38zbi
