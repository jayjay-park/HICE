4572624,0,t1_ct6z13d,The best way of improving the measurement at this mass is to have have events with this energy in the collision. If we were colliding two fundamental particles like electrons this would be easy. Just tune the beam energy to hit this sweet spot. Unfortunately were colliding protons which are comprised of  quarks which are held together with gluons in actuality theres also a sea of virtual particles as well. The energy of the proton is shared between all the component particles. When we collide two protons it is typically only one quark or one gluon from each proton which interacts. The incident protons have combined TeV of energy. The resonance requires TeV. As the energy is shared among the patrons particles in the proton the probability of the two in the collision having over TeV is small. The best way of increasing the probability of the two patrons having TeV is to increase the total energy of the colliding protons.... which we just have done from TeV each to .TeV so we now have TeV to play with. In this second run we should be able to collect data in this region much quicker than a couple of years ago and be able to identify where something is there or not.,CERN,ct6zm9b,4,t5_2r692
