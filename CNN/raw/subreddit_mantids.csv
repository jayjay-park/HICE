853808,0,t3_23wsrm,Some are more aggressive than others. They seem to have individual personalities but most are pretty chill. If one happens to get the tip of the foreleg to stab you then yes it can draw blood. Its happened to me. However this is rare. And yes if they get a hold on you they will bite especially if being restrained but it doesnt usually hurt. Just handle them gently and youll be fine.,mantids,ch1c0ay,9,t5_2txas

Its larger than carolina mantises but smaller than Chinese. You can probably order the oothecas egg cases from a gardening store. Or if you want then more as pets you can probably find individuals on Mantidforum.net. how many are you wanting to keep as pets? ,mantids,cphoij4,1,t5_2txas
