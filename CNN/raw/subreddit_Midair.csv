4986520,0,t1_cumhoqg,You still have to start somewhere. You cant put up  different size servers all running the same maps. The team has to figure out the ballpark team size they are designing the game for. You can easily go up or down a player or two but maps designed for v wont likely play well at v so to start they need to pick  or  sizes and build the gamemaps around those target sizes. Then if the ppl need  more or  less you make the change easily. ,Midair,cun26fm,1,t5_37zfa

5885263,0,t1_cxd0dfp,Agreed. That said I jumped back into older tribes and tried out the more I define my loadouts type system verse the more common heres your class system. MUCH prefer the self defined. I think the way to help new players in that regard is giving them some solid predefined loadouts they can choose from which if I recall T did.,Midair,cxr3b0f,1,t5_37zfa
6022622,0,t1_cxqc4c1,gt In the end a lot of the time grab frequency is more important than just pure speed but I like the fact that both can be viable depending on the circumstances each with their own counters.Oh God this. TA was so infuriating because it was built so that grab frequency was inferior to super frontloaded speed regen routes. By the end I got used to those being mised in but a good balance of ez to make LO routes mixed with speed routes was essential to keeping the meta from feeling stale in previous games... and that never really existed in TA its been fairly stale meta since almost beta. ,Midair,cy937e6,1,t5_37zfa

7508881,0,t3_4i5pk6,I have a vague recollection about custom servers being discussed somewhere? It may be that for a small amount of coins you could run a custom server with a specific config.,Midair,d2vpzzq,1,t5_37zfa

7952303,0,t3_4o61gs,Theres a forum for those with Instant Access.  I dont know how active the devs are with respondinginteracting with players however.  This subreddit isnt really ideal for giving feedback right now so the forum is your best bet.,Midair,d49wx3e,4,t5_37zfa
8477602,0,t1_d611185,Do we know why? Ive played every Tribes and even though I knew inheritance was a hot topic across games... I never realized it was also changing across weapons in the same games. After all these years I know realized why it was so hard to calibrate myself across different weapons. Childhood ruined.,Midair,d618qqc,2,t5_37zfa
8713229,0,t1_d6urpvs,There is a one time unlock fee for all weapons and armour classes but ingame sprays and armour colours like team specific come at a price.  Just ornamental stuff.,Midair,d6ush3e,2,t5_37zfa
9690836,0,t3_5ddj9h,I enjoy making multiple accounts not that Im good enough for anyone to complain about it anyway. I hope they dont get rid of smurf accounts but I would be  behind there being an indicator of some sort which shows that its a smurf account.,Midair,da7ln6k,1,t5_37zfa

9883858,0,t3_5gu731,Theres a couple clips with it in some of the earlier montages  I think Shads first one after Kickstarter and my first one which was an utter disaster and nobody should watch.,Midair,davw2fm,1,t5_37zfa

11370134,0,t3_62483r,i put it somewhere between t and tc vets from both games are playing and actually agreeing on things which is weird. biggest difference to TA in base is the naked spawn and only one bullet weapon.,Midair,dfks76i,2,t5_37zfa
