1148831,0,t3_2783yi,I dont know much about gay scene either but I suppose its far from vibrant. There are some small cafs and bars which are gay friendly the small Imagina caf very close to Campo S. Margherita  mins from your place.Remember Venice at night is quiet and dark with very few big spots of nightlife Rialto area or S. margherita where students and young people get together. There are no real clubs but many barspubs and cafs.If you want to enjoy the beach go to Lido and if you want to go to Alberoni you must also take a bus. You may also spend some hours visiting the small and quite Burano and Torcello islands  mins via waterbus.You may enjoy a night walking along the Zattere bank.The suggestion I give you is buy a map for emergency and then just walk around. Get lost. Enjoy the city.It all depends on what youre looking for what kind of people you are and your budget ,Venezia,chyuueo,2,t5_2t1es
