469115,0,t3_1zgvxk,You seem to have a good grasp of proportions and anatomy. At first the left hand looked twisted around to the front but I realized that it was just line work that needed to be cleaned up.I just noticedthe character has four fingers on his left hand but only three on his right. I can understand if you were trying out the number of fingers in context but if you decided on four be sure to add in the fourth finger even if it is just another outline to one of the other fingers.Also on the right hand dont forget that the thumb has a BIG base of muscle on the heel of the hand. Be sure to show this on the right hand.For the left I like to think of the palm of the hand as a square I would suggest either lengthening the hand which you could do just by moving the knuckles down or shortening the fingers.Furthermore when a hand is down by the side at rest the palm faces inwards with the thumbs towards the front and the fingers are slightly curled. But I get it if the character is holding his hand like that on purpose.TLDR Watch your details on the hands otherwise clean up your line work and youre practically ready for commissions!Edit a word.,FurryArtSchool,cftl92w,2,t5_2tfdm

722249,0,t3_22fn7u,I suspect because that while you recognize you have very detailed and skillful elements to your work the stylized portions hold you back in a sense. In this case when I look at it the eyes are what stand out the most because they are far more simple and cartoony than the realistic detail you have put into everything else. Anime eyes can be used in realism like this but think of the detail put into them  highlights pupils gradients eyelashes bold curves  all or some are used for stylized eyes. Try tweaking the eyes first and see how it affects the rest of the picture. ,FurryArtSchool,cgmdg0c,7,t5_2tfdm

Im not exactly sure what to suggest here except trying to emulate your favorite artists rendition of hands. You mentioned Goldenwolf so if I where you I would try to work from her style.

I never figured out how to do that arm so I left it unfinished and never finished the footsies either. I realized after I started what an idiotic pose I picked for my first attempt. Thanks for any critiquesredlinescriticismtips!The pose is supposed to be on hands and knees with one foot directly behind her left and one slightly off to the side both with toes under.I also WANTED her to be looking at the viewer but she had other plans Also sorry if the NSFW nature makes anyone uncomfortable.

2400942,0,t1_cm86dxt,I have GIMP so I have to use SAI for everything up to the stage where I blend the colours and apply tonal gradient.. Ive noticed that the higher you put the stabliser the more likely SAI is to make your whole line fit its pressure curve as well as its stablisation curve. The result is that you have a max pressure area in the middle no matter how finely you control the pressure from your hand. I therefore shade with a low max pressure on SAI and with minimal stabilisation perhaps give that a try  I dont have photoshop so I cant try it for you ,FurryArtSchool,cm8gqx0,1,t5_2tfdm
2758511,0,t1_cnhm3i7,Hoodies are cool.  Its just that the focus for the picture seemed to be on his head yet you drew a decent amount of his torso.  If the focus is the head draw just the head neck and maybe the tops of the shoulders at best.  If its supposed to be a bust head shoulders and part of the chest try to challenge yourself by drawing anatomy andor detailed attire.  You could have left the hoodie open for example and given yourself a chance to draw his physique under it.You should try to pick a part of each drawing as you learn to focus on.  Focus on the head or focus on the pose of a full body anatomy studies help of course or focus more strictly on anatomy overall.  As a swimmer hed have a very toned but compact body for example.  So hard lines would show up on a slender body giving you something to put highlights or shadows around.Also thanks for the gold.  gt,FurryArtSchool,cnhmrak,1,t5_2tfdm
2904204,0,t1_cny4q6l,.  Look at a human head or take a picture of the side of your head or face on.  Youll see that the top of your ear will line up with your eyebrows and the bottom of your ear will line up with the bottom of your nose.  If you drew a line around the head for either point of the ear youd find that the ear on the other side is  of the time the same size and position.  Likewise with most mammals their ears will follow the same startend positions.  The lowest part of the ear that joins with the head is usually in line with the center of the eyes or the eyebrow.  The rest of the ear curves up from that point and around the head that front ridge of the ear is literally the highest and lowest points of the ear on the head.  The top of the ear ends in line with the center of the eye again usually based on species only on top of the head rather than around the side of the head.  So basically if you took a tennis ball and considered the frontcenter of the ball to be the center of the eye you could put a dot  degrees off to the side of that point and  degrees up from that point.  Those are the approximate locations of the ear.  Where things change on animals though is that ears dont face directly forward.  They have an offset where the top of the ear is in front of the bottom of the ear.  That offset is such that if you were to lay a straight edge between the two points it varies from  degrees off of straight up.  Usually its  degrees but some animals have droopy ears and the  degree option holds more true..  Eyes are important.  They are a major indicator of the emotions a character is portraying.  Happier eyes are typically closed more from the bottom and the outer corners of the eyes are typically raised because the cheeks are raised pushing up the bottom of the eye.  Likewise an angry look has more narrow eyes with a raised lower eye but the brow is also coming down to give maximum scowling potential.  Shock fear sadness they all play off of the surrounding facial features..  The contour is the line from forehead to eye socket dip to cheek to jaw.  The straighter that line or the more angular those lines like a deep eye socket to the cheek then a harsh line down to the jaw the harsher and more masculine the appearance.  The forehead though leads to the brow which on many animals is a rather thick bump.    This rounds down into the dip for their eye socket.  The depth of the eye socket is dependent on the species as well how deeply set their eyes are but is affected by the brow ridge and the cheek as well.  The cheek then plays a major role in how round their face appears.  If its low the cheek is typically rounder and softer looking.  The higher it is the harsher the appearance.  Again cheek height affects the level of the bottom of the eye leading to naturally intense looks felines where the corner of the eye angles up more or naturally cute or sadder looks otters where the corner of the eye angles down more..  Eyes are actually the most expressive portion of the face followed by the mouth.  But the cheek moves in response to emotions tensing and rising up when happy or angry or relaxing and falling when sad or frightened fear mostly because youre focusing on clenching your jaw or screaming and your eyes want to see as much as possible as part of the fight or flight response..  Again take a picture of yourself face forward and draw vertical lines down the picture.  There are certain features which begin and end at certain other features.  Your eyes are normally one eye width apart and your nose is normally the width of that gap at the bottom where the nostrils are.  Your mouth corner to corner is normally the distance from the center of one eye to the other.  There are variances for biology because nature is imperfect or has evolved or just mutated in certain ways to benefit having a narrower mouth or wider nose but this generally holds true for all mammals from monkeys to elephants elephants...  not quite?  But very close.  Muzzles are more of a feeling sort of.  But for longer muzzled creatures consider the size of their head.  If the muzzle is longer than the radius of their head sphere its probably too long.  Again there are exceptions foxes tend to have longer muzzles than that red foxes and other arboreal varieties for example but again feelings..  You start by looking at anatomy.  In general its accepted that furries are human from the neck down so even looking at yourself in a mirror and copying down what you see will give you an idea of how its supposed to look.  Studying anatomy naked the subject not yourself.  Unless you are the subject gives you the best idea of how a body looks.  Never learn anatomy from other peoples drawings unless theyre attempting to draw hyper realistic things like the sketches in Grays Anatomy.  Drawing from someone elses picture will only copy their shortcuts at best but you will always fall short of someone elses style unless you practice a lot.  If youre going to put in that much practice why not try to copy reality rather than someone elses style?  Go find porn sexy poses rather than action shots and couples go study Grays Anatomy go study yourself in a mirror go find your significant other and ask if theyd like to pose for a while look up artist pose sites.  There are a plethora of places to look start from the inside out.If youre going to try to make a revision I recommend starting anew with a fresh sheet of paper and trying to get the same look with the tips youve gotten thus far.  Whether you post that here or in a new thread is up to you.  Its easier to separate critiques in a new post though.  You could even do a new picture with a different angle if you like.,FurryArtSchool,cny7pid,4,t5_2tfdm

3251460,0,t3_2xcndy,Im very much a beginner but Ive had some success by drawing shading in layers. So I would pick a dark color maroon black indigo etc and draw on top of what Ive already colored then reduce the transparency of the shade to about  to . For shading further away I use the airbrush just along the edges of the lines to add the fuzz.

3590580,0,t1_cq1ht0g,Yeah thats essentially what I meant by less stylized.  Guidelines can be tricky at first it took me longer than Id like to admit to learn the shape of a dogs muzzle but what you really need to keep in mind is that you use them to plot out your subjects form using simple shapes and lines.  It seems like part of the problem is that you arent using guidelines properly.  For starters line quality isnt  important not to say that you shouldnt practice drawing lines well mostly because you use guidelines to plan your drawing and erse them as you proceed.  Theyre basically simple templates that allow you to proportion your subject and see how every thing looks. Before you start actually drawing it.  Tomorrow Ill be able to use my scanner so Ill be able to use pictures to better explain what I mean.,FurryArtSchool,cq1jxy2,2,t5_2tfdm

3637810,0,t1_cq6x82l,I know I was cracking the wise or so they say. Out of curiosity how much experience have you had with d modelling programs?

3702713,0,t3_32rykz,If you look up a site called Blender Cookie they have some great tutorials there.  The problem with Blender tutorials though is they all apply some useful info even into later versions so nobody takes down the old ones.  gtDSeriously though your first forays into Blenders usage is always going to be rough but it gets easier the more you use it and the more you remember the keyboard shortcuts.  Thats the trick with all D programs really invest your time in learning the keyboard shortcuts and when theyre muscle memory youll be flying.  But thats just learning how to use a tool and media like learning how to layer paints using oil based paint and a brush or how to blend coloured markers on paper.And this is why I say anatomy is important to learn so that you can make decent work when you do learn those tools.  Yes Photoshop may be what most consider the best art program on PC mostly because a lot of people have never heard of TVPaint or any number of alternatives but I digress.  But if your skill level as an artist is stick figures pencils or Photoshop the results will be the same.  Likewise with Blender versus D Studio MaxMaya.  Blender is the indie modeling software DSMaya are the professionals choice.  But if you dont know anatomy basic architecture or colour theory it doesnt matter which you use.Your goals are actually quite good though.  Game modding is an excellent entry to game design and making models for a popular game especially if your models become popular additions is a sure fire way to get into the industry as a modeler because youll have a portfolio of successful works out in the wild for people to see.Likewise very good on picking up that UV maps make for good sewing patterns.  They need a liiiitle tweaking to be used as patterns.  They dont have overlap to allow you to stitch together the pieces while hiding the thread.  Also tightly bunched UV areas are an indicator that theres additional geometry in that area and youll find yourself unwrapping little things like ears on a bear a lot as separate UV meshes in the same map to spread out the UV topology in the map.I highly suggest not using the sculpt tool to make your creations and instead move vertices around in edit mode extruding as needed for additional geometry.  Also less is more for both plush and game design.  Your life will be infinitely easier dealing with a few hundred polygons than a few tens of thousands despite how nice and detailed your models may look.  Likewise game models especially noncharacter models especially models there may be more than one of like crates or lamp posts cannot be very heavy on geometry.  They have to be as low poly as possible so that you can fill a scene with hundreds of them and not slow down rendering them all.,FurryArtSchool,cqec17b,1,t5_2tfdm

For me I have no problem with mine specifically because I like drawing environments. Transitioning to characters it was basically the same way youd treat them. Think of objects as symbols. A building is a rectangle with lights. A hill could be a A shaped. it depends on your style. More specifically is there a background style youd like to aim for with an example?

I really know how it can be most of you like me will have days where you fail and go and play WoW or league or whatever. That happens. As long as you keep trying and you think about what you should expect then you can keep it realistic.

6104794,0,t3_3z52sn,its very blocky. The lines are unclean and the position looks stiff. His muzzle is in profile but his eyes are in a positioned the would be at an angle to us and his ears are straight on. This would indicate he has both of his eyes on one side of his head. Id recommend drawing actual people to learn proportions and things and doing gesture drawing to help get better flow in a drawing.,FurryArtSchool,cyjjwqx,3,t5_2tfdm
6114903,0,t3_3yfevr,They are cute but from what Ive seen theyve no hands or feet. Is this because you have a hard time drawing them? You wont grow as an artist by avoiding what you are bad at.,FurryArtSchool,cykp9dx,1,t5_2tfdm

6646234,0,t3_46n65m,Well the toy feels just a bit wonky but thats a nitpick at best. The light also seems a bit inconsistent coming from the right on the fox and the left on the doll. Overall though its damn good. Bravo. ,FurryArtSchool,d06s1ap,1,t5_2tfdm
6765186,0,t3_48eoq7,to start off i ADORE the way you drew the legs! theyre really curvy and the tiny peets are so cute. love it. the shape of the muzzle is also really nice it gives the drawing a really soft bouncy kinda style! i think its wonderful!first id suggest joining the legs a little more with the crotch the gap seems a little awkward and its also a bit too high on the torso. with the tail the position doesnt seem right it looks like its coming from the leg rather than from above the butt. a good thing to do is mark where the tail is coming from on the body and think about where the character would realistically be holding it. the arms are very round in your drawing it can be a lovely stylistic choice especially going along with the rest of the piece but i cant tell if the characters arms are shaped that way or if they have a puffy sweater. adding clothing lines is super important its tough and pretty daunting but references are key! look up some photos of garments like the one youre drawing and think about where the material would fall. with the hands they seem a bit too small upping the size would look a lot more natural! the forearms have a bit of a bowling pin shape again i would definitely recommend referencing. remember your own body is right there and its one of the best references you have so use it wisely! the characters left hand is a little starfishy hands are some of the hardest body parts to draw though so practice is key here.for the face i did a little redline here! ill list the stuff i went overthe eyes were slightly off angle really minor mistake but worth pointing out!id recommend having the hair stick out from the basic shape of the head a little more.with ears the openings dont face forward so much and they arent so flat. looking at a real animals ears they look more like an opening.adding the bridge to the muzzle helps to define the face shape a lot and improves the artwork!remember the mouth has two sides! id also say that the face needs to be more flat rather than taller i cant entirely tell what species im looking at here and defining the face shape more should help.best of luck hopefully i can offer some help!!,FurryArtSchool,d0j43cr,2,t5_2tfdm

7205629,0,t3_4cslbh,Theres a big disparity in your work Im not sure which are oldest and which are newest and some are in vastly different styles from the rest.  These are in my opinion your strongest works   They have very interesting compositions and lighting usage. This one is I like that the action thats going on however the way things are placed Im not sure whats going on definitely needs some shadows or floor texture going on.Youre on the right track.  Just keep studying and working hard.  Try drawing from life and if you can build up on your fundamentals.  Color theory lighting anatomy and perspectiveforeshortening and composition.  Its really good to go out there and really experience the things youre trying to draw.  Remember if you want to be the best youve gotta be like a scientist in some ways make new discoveries and observations about the world by drawing from life.If you can try taking a figure drawing class from a community college or convince your family significant others to pose for you.,FurryArtSchool,d1x80tz,2,t5_2tfdm

9767673,0,t3_5ey9fn,Theres a lot of little things that are off.  Ill start with a common complaint of mine profile or front on views suck.  Theyre flat and uninteresting.  It takes a lot of skill to make either view look interesting because they are the views that present the viewer with the least amount of detail.  You have to heavily reinforce perspective to make them work and if you do then youre not quite doing a straight on view anymore.  I will say you did a decent job with the heads structure and the arm guard is well defined and honestly the best feature of the picture. His limbs are inconsistently sized for his body.  The tail is very thin for a sergal while it should taper from a thick half back width base.  Remember it has to move a huge length of tail so it has to both be rooted well and cover the pulling force of not just the length of the tail but also the parts inbetween.  The legs are also rather thin.  Theres an anatomy chart for them on the Vilous wiki including references about regional anatomical differences.  For such a thick chest youd expect the arms to be equally beefy and the legs likewise very powerful but no such apparent thickness is shown. Part of what ruins the thickness of the arms is the hands which appear to be quite small for his frame.  Sergal hands are long and narrow. The other part of it is you chose black as your colour and then stuck with that sheer black without any variation in tone to suggest depth.  Theres no distinguishing between arms in front or behind his body nor with the legs though they appear to be precisely in line with each other. His leg structure is also wrong.  First issue is you dont have much definition on how the kilt flows around his thighs to define a shape.  The lower leg is simply a circle thats connected at the knee with no muscle definition or attention to skeletal structure.  And then his foot is super thick from his ankle down without the telltale splayed handfoot. The chest is also a bit off.  While its well defined from the side for a human male sergals have higher rib cages that end abruptly at a protruding sternum.  This means they have a very high chest with a prominent centre point and a narrower chest overall and that their waist is accordingly quite high long and thin.  Where a human rib cage would be probably  to  of their torso counting the pelvis as well a sergals appears to be barely more than  from what Ive seen.  This means his muscle mass would be concentrated higher on this chest and hed have a prominent point in the middle of his chest then below that his body would curve inward dramatically giving him a much thinner stomach unless hes overweight.Normally Id say go look at reference photos but this is a fictional race built up from components of so many other animals and a few new things for good measure.  While I cant claim to be an expert on sergals Ive done an example character to help explain some of the things I was talking about.  He has a decided curve to his body from head to leg and head to tail.  Hes not straight on so you can make out details everywhere.  The neck is longer another trait of sergals.  The tail tapers from a thick base to a narrow end with the tuft at the end.  And the legs have some definition to them for a digitigrade character including the exaggerated ankle joint.  If I had to change something though Id move his right leg in a bit more so the foot is resting more under his body.  It would further reinforce his stance.,FurryArtSchool,dah2z71,3,t5_2tfdm
10262956,0,t3_5mt1q0,Left leg short then right left arm shorter then right. With facing direction both of those could have passed with a slight bit more length but are a easy catch with both being shorter. As well the right hand is awkwardly backwards when facing up the thumb is facing outwards. Lacks a muzzle impression you can see you started on it but seems like you just got distracted. lack of distinguishable fur accept on face.Shading... I will give you the same tip I got on this aspect a long time ago. Pick your space where your light source is coming from and if you need to mark it. Choose the size and work it out to how it will effect the scene. This will help with shading tons as it will give you a better focus and a way to kind of focus your mind on it. Though definitely a great start and should be easy to cleanup.,FurryArtSchool,dc7d1f0,1,t5_2tfdm

11320217,0,t3_61jxvc,I think its worth building up your fundamental skills first before you start refining your style.But yeah doing a piece where you imitate the style of a good artist is a great way to find a style that works for you. Even if it doesnt ever see the light of day  I sure as hell never posted mine when I did it  its good to find individual aspects that make that persons art pop and working pieces of different peoples styles into your own.,FurryArtSchool,dff4lnv,3,t5_2tfdm

11394425,0,t3_62i3q7,Shade anywhere theres something on top of something else first. Thats the easiest one to get rightThen decide where your light source is and shade the things that arent directly hit by it.If you want to get fancy try for realistic shadows where theyre shaped by the item casting it.,FurryArtSchool,dfnjj7b,2,t5_2tfdm
