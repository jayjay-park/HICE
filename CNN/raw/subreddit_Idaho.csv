4293738,0,t1_cs8zahd,Original territory capital.  When they sent in the paperwork to Washington DC whatever that consisted of people in Boise shanghaied it and changed the capital to read Boise instead of Lewiston so when I did become a state it was officially Boise and Lewiston was left out.

9095138,0,t1_d850bmf,No I read the whole bill. It was specifically to allow the bible to be used in science and math classes. I cant recall if this was a state or county bill though sorry. As a trained historian I absolutely defend the use of the bible in history classes. At the college level. I think it should probably be discussed but not actively read when teaching history in middle school and high school. I also agree that it is also valuable when discussing historical literature as you describe. But again Id prefer to put off actually reading texts until college or maybe some advanced classes in high school.,Idaho,d8538qj,7,t5_2qtxr

11494147,0,t3_63y116,A few questions I can answer Yes mormons do live here they are mostly friendly and accepting. They are outnumbered by the rest of the population so they are typically very nice. And yes they do knock on your door.  We are a red state. There is one truly blue county Latah which is up north where the University of Idaho is. Just keep your opinions to yourself when youre down south and you should be fine. Second half Im up north and we are seattle seahawks fans up here. I dont do the sports thing so I dont pay much attention other than everything is seahawks.  Up here we have seen  degree weather fairly regularly each summer. A good  weeks of consistant heat.  My utilities when using electricity and heat full time during the winter was at most   a month. During the spring and fall its like  and during the summer depending on AC use its about .  Idaho rocks its roads or atleast it does up here. ,Idaho,dfyuzsc,1,t5_2qtxr
