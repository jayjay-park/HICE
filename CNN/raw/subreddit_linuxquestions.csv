Stuff is all over the place documentation is thin to non existent theres legacy cruft everywhere nothing is logical.  In UnixLinux you can say this thing is probably there and it most likely is. In Windows who can tell?And of course theres the day to day comfort of a multitasking environment when Windows or Mac OS is still designed around a single application at a time. I can use a window thats behind another window. I can move a window without bringing it to the front or move it in the Z stack. As a French user I can easily access all of the characters I need in every application without using the stupid Altxxx shortcuts because I have a complete keymap and a Compose key.

1619889,0,t3_2cgafu,I bookmarked this when I saw it and finally got a chance to try out all the suggestions. For me at least copy.com was by far one of the best but this is what I noted Dropbox was the poorest of alternatives even though it has good integration with file managers and works well under linux it has one of the higher costs doesnt work well for backups and has the smallest free limit. Spideroak seems great for backups and syncing between computers but lacks the ability to share a file publicly and the free space was not particularly large. There is also an android app. If it had larger storage and the ability to share files publicly I would replace both crashplan and copy.com with this. Hubic has a good amount of space and a decent webui but it has no GUI app under Linux which was a dealbreaker for me. Also doesnt cover backups. Jottacloud doesnt have a Linux client yet but it is in the works for Q  looks alright otherwise but I didnt look much further.  copy.com has a Linux client that works reasonably well lets you limit updownload speeds even apparently has support for local agent syncing to avoid going out to the cloud I havent noticed this working yet but havent done particularly thorough tests it can be run headless as well and has a service for it with the AUR package for Archlinux. GB of free storage is one of the best around also has an Android app. Doesnt have any backup system like spideroak. Currently I am using this in combination with crashplan for actual backups. It even has ARM support if you use an rpi or similar device.,linuxquestions,cjjcpmk,1,t5_2rbms

There was a dev discussion a couple of days ago.Basically when the power goes off battery is depleted BIOS looses its crosssystem flags that let you use legacy boot option. These flags appear to reside in a writable area of the BIOS when it looses power it reverts itself to default state. Its a bug.If I recall correctly all you need to do is log back into ChromeOS and reenable said flags  set crosssystem to  then boot w Ctrl  L like you normally would.IM NOT SURE PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

1857258,0,t3_2fuv8z,I cant speak from experience no recent experience anyway here but I can tell you generally what needs to be done.You need free and unpartitioned space on your hard drive to install Windows to.  If your entire drive is allocated already you may need to use fdiskparted to shrink your partition and your filesystem tools such as tunefs for ext to shrink your filesystem.  You should be careful when installing Windows and be sure not to allow the installer to take over the entire drive.  Windows will take over as bootloader.  I dont think theres any getting around this.  If its UEFI they may be able to coexist but Im not entirely sure.You will need to boot live from disk or flash drive.  From there you will chroot into your system to repair GRUB.Your bootloader situation will depend on whether you are booting UEFI or BIOS style.  MBR should be a simple matter of chainloading Windows.  Windows stores its boot record at the beginning of the partition to which it is installed the VBR.  The master boot record for a Windows machine just points to the partition with the boot flag.  Chainloading is pretty much the same thing only you specify the partition to point to.UEFI as I understand it is a little more complicated but its then a matter of chainloading Windows EFI code instead of its VBR.Of course your Linux entries can load the kernel directly from Grub.Sorry Im not giving you specifics here.  Im not prepared to give you a step by step but I hope in giving you the general idea of what needs to be done youll find further instruction easier to understand.,linuxquestions,ckcztjf,1,t5_2rbms

And it has to be a US number too. But other than that yeah its free. They dont charge you anything to either receive or make calls in the domestic US. Not sure about overseas though. I think those do cost but the rates are cheap ......... Also not certain if you can get this at all outside the US either.  Ubuntu also has a number of softphones or sip phone programs available to it as well if you wanna go that way but they do require a sip accountgateway of some kind which you generally have to pay for to get dialindialout access. But they are ridiculously cheap on their rates. Some of them are a real PITA to set up too but once you get them working as long as you have the bandwidth they are just as good as a landline.

Its well known as a stable versioned distro. The only downside is most of the packages in the stable release while they are always patched for security are a bit older than most other distros. It uses the apt package manager. Gentoo is a sourcebased distribution that is more appropriately a metadistribution in the sense that you begin with a base system and build from there so no two installs are alike. It uses the portage package manager which builds all the software from source with scripts called ebuilds. Portage employs unique USE flags which are used to control how the target software is compiled. Arch is similar to Gentoo as a meta distro but mainly ships binary packages for desired software. It uses the pacman package manager. A great thing about Arch is the ABS or Arch build system which allows you to buildrebuild any software using scripts called PKBUILDs. There is a large number of usersubmitted PKGBUILDs in a repo called the AUR that provides a lot of software not packaged by the official Arch devs which is why it is completely unsupported.,linuxquestions,cmiv5og,5,t5_2rbms
2493233,0,t3_2o4by6,I would suggest searching for and if necessary filing a bug report.  You may find a solution or at least a workaround  Had this happen a few times with Debianbased distros as uPadfoots mentioned in some cases shutdown takes the network down before unmounting shares  in my case it was NFS shares but same problem.  Had the problem for a couple months with Debian there were bug reports already.  One day shutdown just quit hanging.They will most likely fix it at some point but another option might be to write your own simple script that unmounts media and then calls shutdown rather than messing with the init process.,linuxquestions,cmk0523,1,t5_2rbms
2511696,0,t3_2oelik,POP is Post Office Protocol. Your software calls the POP server and downloads mail. Thats about it. You cannot create folders or organize your mail in any way on the server itself. Its good enough for casual users with one device.IMAP enables you to create folders and organize your mail on the server itself. Management is easier if you have more than one device accessing the same email account.If you lose or break your device your POP mail is lost forever. With IMAP anything that was still in the folders can be redownloaded automatically.,linuxquestions,cmmf0yg,3,t5_2rbms

A typical Linux installation might just do a lot more things while idle.If the battery time you are getting is not satisfactory play with powertop. Youll see quickly were the power goes. And from there its just a few clicks.Im getting  hours out of a laptop rated at hrs with Ubuntu out of the box with max backlight Wifi and stuff running all the time. I dont know whether Windows is better in real life since I never use it.BTW You can just boot Linux from USB and see.

3075658,0,t3_2vdvdn,RegularExpressions.info is dedicated to teaching you regular expressions.  If I understand you correctly character ranges and POSIX character classes are forbidden in this assignment but that does not rule out ALL character classes.  How many different ways are there of spelling the letters p a and s and how would you represent these in a regular expression?  It would also seem that pass can be spelled in any combination of upper and lowercase letters but word must be lowercase with the letters o and r being optional.Character classes are useful when a few letters can be either upper or lower case.  A character class always stands in for a single character but that character can be one of any character that appears within the class.For example if the word yes may appear in any mixedcase form as input a way of checking whether it appears at all could be by using character classes for each letter    YyEeSs    where    Yy is either Y or y    Ee is either E or e    Ss is either S or sBut what if someone simply answers Y instead of the full word or even Ye?  Then we need a way of specifying the possibility that the character does or does not appear.  A question mark in a regular expression indicates that whatever precedes the question mark may or may not be there.  So for our example we could do something like this to indicate any possible form of yes    YyEe?Ss?This says that Y or y must appear and that E e S or s may also appear but are optional.  This actually allows for input that probably would not be acceptable such as Ys since that would match but would not necessarily indicate a yes answer.But we should also realize that regular expressions do not recognize words but patterns.  If we want to only find whole words that match the pattern we are using b will specify a word boundary    bYyEeSsbThat should give you enough information to construct the regular expression that satisfies your assignment requirements.  Of course to be sure you get it right test it against all of the sample input you have.,linuxquestions,cogsg1t,2,t5_2rbms

Just wipe the useless internal GB SSD with dd and disable it in the BIOS  then forget about it completely.  Pop a nice GB SanDisk Extreme card into the SDHC slot and install into that instead  everything will fit then and its actually slightly faster than the old internal PATA SSD is anyway.  Finally although KDE does run decently enough on the things if youve previously upgraded the RAM to GB as I have its still KDE regardless yecch..  For that reason I usually install either Enlightenment or LXDE and boot the little things into either instead.  Performancewise they do p YouTube fullscreened with Flash quite smoothly  and VLC or SMPlayer will do p DVD ripfiles fullscreen about as well.edit  PS  forget about those socalled netbook remixes that stuff was useless as they simply wasted screenspace differently.

Arch mounts the EFI on boot.Some distro installers will do that automatically for you if you tell the installer to use that partition as an EFI partition some wont and you may need to specify that it is to be mounted as bootefi.All you need to do in the BIOS is turn off SecureBoot. Also preferably turn off FastBoot. Then make sure you boot the install medium with UEFI most likely from the BIOS boot menu.,linuxquestions,cvaxe96,1,t5_2rbms

Skype is both part of PRISM and skype messaging at least is available in plaintext to Microsoft servers despite claiming endtoend encryption.

Youre running echo with sudo which is not necessary but the redirect to the output file is not actually part of the echo command. The redirect is run by you.You can solve this problem though    echo  | sudo tee sysclassbacklightintelbacklightbrightnessThat will run tee with sudo so you could run the script as your user and only use sudo for the bit that needs elevated privileges.That would also echo it to the terminal at the same time.,linuxquestions,cxcwkr2,1,t5_2rbms

You can remove sudo privileges or even better grant your user account the sudo rights you need that would get you setup in a way that fits with their requirements. Obviously youd need some access to to things that typically require admin rights on Linux that wouldnt on windows changing network settings running updates etc but those can be explicitly defined in the sudoers file. Youd probably have to get them to setup the root password and file it away too. If they have a AD domain setup you can bind to it and use it for authentication so that they are able to manage your credentials and network permissions as well.Those are just a few things I could think of off the top of my head so I may have forgot something but Im sure others will chime in too.

If you decide to revoke access at a later time then you need to change the passwords and update everyone.

Because why break what already works? If I wanted to test some aspect of a different kernel version Id first try to use the config Im already using. And that would mean using initramfs.Furthermore I think many people wont want to learn much about the kernel but rather use your program to solve specific problems. Like maybe their network card doesnt work and theyve heard that a new kernel version supports it. So theyd want to install it with minimum hassle preferably fully automagically download a new kernel compile with current config which can include entries added by patches from the distro.I also think that the number of people from the previous two groups will be greater than the number of people who want to learn a bit about the kernel.

Virtualization is years ahead of other OSes Xen as hypervisor is still pretty much standard there I think. Also KVM is far ahead of of most other OSes. It took windows for example about  years to at least ship some kind of virtual machine with the OS. But by then linux was already in the process of abandoning a lot of virtualization methods in favour of docker. Most other OSes are still trying to catch up there...again windows as example. At the moment they really try very hard to offer some kind of alternative to docker...but from the looks at still pretty far away from having a good solution there.Or let have a look at webservers not strictly linux as those run on many OSes...in the time Microsoft managed to get one product out several open source webserver tries were even abandoned again Anyone still remember the webserver in the linux kernel?. And then there was still enough time to create nginx as competition to apache...because lets face it...there was no real competition for apache before. Mailsevers...there was enough time to write new mailservers solely because the sendmail configuration was worse than a dentist visit. Overall it looks for me you really just look at the wrong place. Large parts of the development around linux is very much bleeding edge. But all examples you mentioned seem to be about graphical interface stuff. To tell the truth...that stuff is in large parts completely boring to create...and very ungrateful. You wont find many developers who will do this in their spare time. Writing GUIs is simply too boring to be interesting....and even if you do all you get is constant complaints from users. The audience is simply different from writing some server application. In the later case you can expect at least some technical proficiency from your users and getting appropriate feedback or people even helping out and adding code. On the other hand if you work on graphical applications meant for the masses all you get is complaints hardly anyone willing or capable to help and not very constructive feedback. This work is better left for people getting paid to do it.

7836634,0,t3_4mn7bj,The first method if you get the hang outside of xwindows it to jump to a terminal login as root and make sure consoledevconsole is on the kernel command line. Set the kernel logging mode with the sysrq keys and use setterm blank  to disable the screen timeout. Then wait for the crash it should dump on the console. It can help to have a video camera pointed at the screen to record the dump Another method is to use a serial cable that is on the board eg not a usb. Then add consolettySX to the kernel when it is booting where X is the serial port number. There is also another parameter to add to the kernel to set baud rates etc..Of course you need another machine to read the serial cable. This will then hopefully capture the stack trace. Then try to figure out from the code in the kernel what is happening.The alternative method is to use kdump which will basically produce a core from the kernel and put it on disk. However this will not work with certain types of crash as the machine locks up.,linuxquestions,d3wwldo,2,t5_2rbms

7850271,0,t3_4mul3x,Lets face it..the term operating system is very fuzzy...so a bit hard to answer your question directly.First of all GNU tools are a collection of tools and library that provide a unix like environment. Here is a list of all gnu projects.There are a few operating systems that completely depends on gnu as their unix environment. In this category fall almost every linux distribution but also Debian GNUkFreeBSD or GNU Hurd The GNU project provides the most basic libraries for those systems and everything in the system depends on it being available. The kernel can be different in those systems but all programs use glibc as libc and are usually compiled with gcc.But as the GNU projects provides many different tools there are also plenty of OSes that dont use GNU projects as the very core..but still distributes gnu tools for a better user experience with their system. Examples for this as MacOSX Solaris qnx....Now with this in mind to your questionsgtBut are these operating systems useful for average user?Well linux for sure is useful for some average users. MacOS for sure as well if you allow adding systems that only ship gnu tools.gt Are all of the software for it free?Nope the gnu tools itself are free In both meanings free of cost as well as in freedom But just because MacOSX ships bash it doesnt mean the whole OS has to be free.gtAnd if it is what kind of specialization is this software?Well I would say the one common things for all gnu tools is that its a unix like environment. Beyond that there isnt much common grounds. Gnu tools are for development shell access but also for include plenty of graphical applications. Another specialty is of course your right to get the sourcecode of them modify it and redistribute your changes. So they are pretty useful for customized systems.gt For whom it is designed?About everyone who wants. As said..gnu tools can be useful for developers artists finance management administration..they even include games.gt Do they have GUIs? Some yes some not. Depends on the program and what it is used for. Not much of a point to have a GUI for a compiler...gimp image editing software on the other hand doesnt make much sense without a GUI.gtAlso how secure are these operating systems?Depends on the OS...and is not directly linked to GNU. Due the the fact that the GNU tools are open source they have at least one advantage...security can be checked. With propritary programs its impossible for users the ever check if they are secure...so by default must be seen as insecure. That of course doesnt meant that GNU tools are secure by default...just that they at least have the chance to be seen as secure. But as gnu tools can be combined with other programs in a OS that are not open source its impossible to make a general statement like OSes with Gnu tools are more secure...they can be terrible as well.Edit typos,linuxquestions,d3yfv0b,2,t5_2rbms

8808326,0,t1_d76mkv3,I get what you are saying about the Linux boot stuff I actually dont know how to do what you are attempting with the menu for multiple bootloaders I dont really think that would be a good idea either. If you use grub as your bootloader for all of them then it will detect all the OSs that are installed and write the changes when you do your updates I believe other bootloaders do the same but it has been a long time since Ive had more than  OSs running on any of my PCs. If you swap the physical locations of the drives they will show up as the SSD being sda and the HDD being sdb doesnt really matter though. As when you install everything you will have to choose where each OS puts its boot. Using a separate home for each install is the easiest way to multiboot like you are intending so when you decide to hop distros all of your stuff from each Linux install will be available. I cant say for certain but I dont think the .cfg will be much of an issue as permissions will be set differently across all distros. Either way if you do use one home use a different user name on each just to be safe.And Im pretty sure you CAN use the D with just one partition for Windows and home it would function but it would be an abomination and very prone to errors. HIGHLY not recommended but should work... let me know if I missed something. ,linuxquestions,d76n2t3,2,t5_2rbms

Besides usually its the CPUGPU that heats up more than the mem modules.

Pick one you can change GUIs later.Longer versionThe different flavours of Ubuntu are exactly the same under the hood they just come with different desktop environments out of the box. You can change the environment after installation by installing some packages you can install a whole bunch and switch between them to figure out which one you like best. Mint is based on Ubuntu and uses its repositories and packages plus some of its own so its also very very similar. The DEs that Mint comes with are also available on Ubuntu so youre not necessarily limited to Mint if you like one of the default Mint DEs.Vanilla Ubuntu comes with Unity which not everyone likes. Preferences aside its quite resourceintensive compared to some of the other environments so you may want to avoid it on an older system. Pick one of the lighter flavours like Lubuntu or Xubuntu or Mint instead.Its impossible for us or you to guess which desktop environment you will like the most ahead of time so dont agonise over your choice.

If so back when I had a similar set up you would install bumblebee from the repositories and it would use the Intel graphics by default and you had use optirun programname to invoke the Nvidia card you could do this simply by editing the launcher.  This may have changed over the past few years so you may want to research it a bit before doing anything.As for the loading time you can run systemdanalyse blame to see whats taking so long at which point troubleshooting can done more accurately.The battery life is interesting the laptop is probably running in performance mode. There may be a way of changing that in Ubuntus power settings but powertop can make a huge difference.Firstly make sure your system is up to date by running sudo apt update ampamp sudo apt upgrade then install powertop by running sudo apt install powertop. Run powertop by using sudo powertop and it will show you whats going on. Use the tab key to have a look at the Tunablesand they should all say Good.

It is good advice as a general ie start with a hypervisor KVM with qemu is a good choice as youll likely see some manner of KVM at a lot of jobs set up a VM for NAT then a bunch of different VMs each hosting some different services for dhcpd web servers mail servers database servers access control LDAP and the like system montioring and logging wholeserver backup solutions with a central backup location a system deployment automation solution etc etc etc. These things will give you a good rough idea of a spectrum of Linux System Administration tasks. Id recommend at least reading about all of these starting asap but dont expect to be an expert in anything on this list before you start the job and do not claim to be one either. Overexaggerating your skills and familiarity will only hurt you and will piss them off. If you go into it having read on these topics some and having dabbled a bit with any of that be honest with them about it. Ive not had much experience with it in the past but I have been researching and started familiarizing myself with an assortment of Linux based topicsservicestasks ranging from insert summarized list of things youve readresearchedtoyed with. I feel I could learn very quickly in the job or not if you dont think that and am eager to learn how you all do things here so I can be the best asset to your team and grow in the position. blah blah blah insert job goals or whatever else.It may be a good idea popping over to rlinuxadmin and asking some of them what they would expect out of someone in your situation. To offer one point of view my job involves web hosting support and I primarily see web servermail serverdatabase server related stuff  so I would recommend for a newhire in support here learn about apache nginx and tomcat postfix sendmail qmail dovecot courier and exim and mysql postgresql mongodb and mariadb as well as DNSdhcp and such on top of typical admin things like knowing about system statistic tools du top free yada yada firewalls and logging the rest would be learned on the job sotospeak.

10311367,0,t1_dccreoc,From my fairly extensive experience with this over the last  years most of the performance loss is CPU bound and stems from the Linux kernel trying to load balance the VCPU cores. Use the isolcpusthreads to stay away from kernel boot parameter to make the process scheduler stay away from the threads you want to use in your VM you can still use taskset to run specific programs on all threads on the host and make sure you use VCPU pinning with correct assignments for socketscoresthreads.Make sure the first core and all threads on it belongs to the host as this is where a lot of system stuff unavoidably lives. This will also increase the IO throughput in the VM since KVM has guaranteed processor time to handle requests before they pile up too much.With VFIO you should no longer need to reboot for Linux to properly reclaim the card but on the other hand I do know some UEFI implementations just refuse to play nice.Edit Some typos fixed terms clarified and some more advice.,linuxquestions,dccule0,2,t5_2rbms

10725652,0,t3_5ta6sb,So here is a brief explanation of linux permissionsThe permissions of a file can be written as  letters or  sets of  letters with one at the start to say what kind of file it is. In order these  sets are permissions for the owner the group of the owner and everyone else.For each set the letters are rwx or  but you can mix and match the letters. r  Read permissions. You can see what is inside. w  Write permissions. You can change what is inside. x  eXecute permissions. You can run this as a program.But permissions can be changed by changing the permissions. Only the root user and the owner of the file can change the permissions.So lets say carol is in the group foo. carol can read and write the file Everyone in foo can read the file Everyone else can read the fileHow permissions work will be more important for you though. Usually the filesystem contains all the permissions information. If a user doesnt have permission the operating system simply stops them doing anything. Because the users in UNIX permissions are UNIX users the filesystem itself cant tell which user is opening something just that the operating system has asked for something.,linuxquestions,ddm9rsl,2,t5_2rbms

IMHO its not so much that Linux is secure but rather windows is insecure. Security really seems like an afterthought with Microsoft. It seems to me like they see security issues as a bug to be fixed later rather that being built to be secure to begin with. Another reason Linux is more secure than windows is that you dont typically download applications from random ass websites rather you typically uses software repositories instead. This also has the added benefit of making it easy to keep everything up to date and applying bug fixes faster.That plus things like not running in root by default and the fact that it is FOSS make it more secure.,linuxquestions,de9nw05,11,t5_2rbms

11097173,0,t3_5ygbre,Another vote for Python or as uxiongchiamiov also suggests perl or ruby.  Pythons versatile and mature the syntax is very uncomplicated although some of the more pythonic syntax can sometimes take a few moments of head scratching and you can usually be confident its already installed as a dependency for something else with most popular linux distributions anyway.  I consider myself to be mostly amateur with python but it suits my needs in a number of areas.  For example       organize my downloads by filetype and then by category.       grab weather information usually via JSON but itll parse HTML too.       keyboard and mouse automation.       read sensor information over the usb serial port perform calculations with that information then generate a webpage served over apache.    Python does have its limitations although if youre just looking to step up OS automation Im fairly sure you wont even begin to approach them but all in all its a straightforward language with quite a lot of power behind it and a very useful skill to have in your repertoire.

11197482,0,t1_dcu6kin,Sorry I never saw this message and just randomly started going back through my comments.  Socks is just a proxy that uses the ssh protocol.  The ssh protocol is perfectly encrypted on both sides and can pass every other protocol inside of it.  A VPN does just about the same thing but I mentioned socks because in Skypes options you simply click a box and type your socks address. Prior to doing this your Skype traffic when you send a message goes out to dozens of Skype servers you are connected to and depending on which version you are using this just very recently got fixed some of your connections go directly to the person you are talking to.  So when that person monitors their traffic they can see all of the addresses their Skype application is using. After cross referencing the connections with real Skype servers the ones left over are those you are directly talking to. or their proxies  Once you hook up to socks instead of connecting to many different servers and possibly the person youre talking to you get one TCP stream of encrypted traffic to the proxy then the proxy forwards all that traffic to Skypes servers and the person youre talking to. Same thing happens in reverse and unless youre looking at your traffic youll never know its happening.  It simply masks where youre coming from and who they are talking to. When you use a VPS that can soak up a bunch more bandwidth than you can youll never even notice him attacking.  Unless his botnet is huge enough to flood out your VPS.  In that case just accept defeat.,linuxquestions,df17ywg,2,t5_2rbms

The difference here is that instead of keeping power to your RAM on it saves the memory state to your hard disk then when you turn the power back on the OS is already initialized and the data read from the hard drive back into memory.Thus if something goes wrong with hibernation the only thing that should be corrupted is the state of the data that was in memory all of the files on your system should still be fine.,linuxquestions,dfx9g22,2,t5_2rbms

11796916,0,t3_68bnlt,First Ive found Java and C to be very similar languages from a writing perspective  the syntax commands and such all function very similarly. Program structure is somewhat different C being the more flexible and they both need to be compiled if I recall but C is both more powerful and more efficient. The efficiency comes from the fact that Java is built for a virtual machine which is in turn built for the physical machine but C cuts out the middle man and runs on the physical machine. The downside to this is while any .jar file will run on any machine with the runtime environment but a compiled C executable will only run on the architecture it was built for  OS processor type and  bits are all factors.C is the predecessor to C  while the two are related C is much more primitive in my limited understanding. You handle raw print statements variable and memory management etc. while C has easier to use methods. In particular it takes the details of memory and variable management off your shoulders. But C is even more efficient than C because of this. As such its a popular language to write OS and firmware programs in.In summart C and C are different languages and should be treated as such. Most courses at least in college will teach C as an extension of C but some people myself included think this is the wrong way to go about it. As to which one you want to use generally the answer is C. It uses similar syntax to Java and its easier to use in general. If you do go with C I can point you in the direction of some resources!,linuxquestions,dgx7yda,2,t5_2rbms
