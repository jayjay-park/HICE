1235009,0,t3_287ms2,As a resident of the planet earth and casual Lord of the Rings fan. I really do like the hobbit films. They do suffer from being a tad to long but that is a symptom of being a Peter Jackson film.Now the current hobbit films really do shine as a testament to hybrid bookmovie storytelling. If you want the story Tolkien originally intended you could read our listen to the book. Audible.comHelloInternet You arent watching The Hobbit novel acted out and filmed. Your watching a trilogy of films based on the novel that have a creative right to change it how they wish. Not to say they dont have a small responsibility to its fans.In the world of  vs  movies and the added fluff I can imagine why they would prefer to make three films and as an aspiring film maker I see taking source material and creating new story regardless if that creation is fueled by greed as a creative challenge. A challenge Id say the writers are doing a mildly good job at accomplishing.Im not denying its an investment fueled move.

We have been slowly increasing lifespan for about the last  years.  Far more slowly than many people think they dont control for infant and childhood mortality.If we consider that pace to be accelerating there is an inflection point where we start adding more than  year to life expectancy per year.  That point changes the equation before that point you are in a losing race we are extending lifespans at E and you are aging at A  as long as E lt A  death in inevitable.

7648986,0,t3_4k1bzw,See Singapore. You are basically suggesting Singapore. The trouble is that there is no recourse for the general population if the policies are detrimental to the masses but benefit the elite or intellectual class. That system would very much and does lend its self to corruption. There is no political penalty for doing anything for personal gain if you dont have to at least front up to the public for an election.Your conception of the population is very Leninist in attitude. It basically holds the population with a sense of disdain preventing anyone to participate in democracy even more so the current political system. You are basically proposing what has been seen as the crisis of democracy theory. The population isnt something that you should try to control with an elite intellectual class from the top down. You need to pressure the institutions and get regular and everyday people involved in things that matter. Any power structure like a private business conglomerate or a state only functions by force and as a power structure it is built to extend its reach as far and as wide as possible. Basically the results of this pretty much predict what we see. Lots of debate about nothing not much change to avoid threatening power structures focus on anything and everything except things that actually matter to people protecting powerful private interests at the expense of the population etc. There is an overemphasis on elections. If you take the US as an extreme example. The US has a near continuous election. Having all the focus all the time on elections does a very useful thing for power structures. It makes all the focus on the election and not on what people can do to actually improve their lives. Which is to organise to change the institutional structures of society to the benefit of the population. It also helps in restricting debate. Having to candidates whose role once in office is very sharply restricted by outside pressure and institutions means that no matter who is elected very little can be done. Having such candidates as the focus means that you get the added benefit of having the loudest discussion in the narrowest of terms to prevent anyone from actually changing the institutional structure of society. That isnt to say to not vote. Small differences in powerful structures can have vast outcomes. Medicare schools abolishion of the White Australia Policy etc. But understand that to actually change things you need to change the power structures in society. Then the question is why do we have an uneducated society. It goes back to what Grey said schools do. You are basically training to be a manufacture worker. A tool of production. School has very little to do with education and within two years almost everything people are taught in school is lost because it isnt an environment that encourages learning. The institutional structure of the media has everything to benefit from people not wanting to change structures in society because they are at the top. So what they spew out is  focussed on everything except what could educate or help people. So as Orwell pointed out in his criticism of the Press in England we end up with a population that is very poorly educated and doesnt attempt to push their societies institutions. As you may have guessed I would support a libertarian socialist society to save the world. ,HelloInternet,d3bnbmg,1,t5_2z1tz

8344865,0,t1_d5kdqqg, Then surely the legitimacy of the referendum should be undermined given how brazenly the proleave side lied. There are not comparable lies from the remain side. You havent answered my question. If you believe border controls are a means of stopping terrorism why limit it to national borders? Surely if we controlled borders between counties it would prevent terrorists moving so easily and would make it harder for them to conduct their affairs.  The question is a balance of probabilities and probable cause. It seems far more likely that doing things like shifting the immigration policy to stop radicalised Muslims entering the country is far less likely to stop potential attackers and far more likely to be yet another example of ostensibly antiMuslim government action which will result in more antagonising of moderate Muslims which will in turn make radicalisation easier. Also I feel I should point out open immigration policy and lack of border control are not the same thing. The UK was not a member of the Schengen zone so if an EU national who was a person of interest to MI showed up at DoverHeathrow etc with an EU passport they could still be refused entry. The UK still has border controls.  Yes but thats a rather unfair picture to paint as it assumes that such a dichotomous choice is either likely or possible.And while the WBC may only be responsible for a couple of dozen deaths the Lords Resistance Army in Uganda and Sudan is responsible for many deaths also.,HelloInternet,d5knub4,2,t5_2z1tz

Really it does neither of these things it simply places more weight on the votes of those who live in more rural states while hindering the votes of those who live in more urban states. Remember that all voters still vote under the Electoral College system. The Mob as it is still rules! Its just that some of the voters are first among equals. Are Wyoming voters more deserving of choosing the next president than Illinois voters? Or California voters?Remember that the whole point of the original Electoral College was to elect Electors. The voters would vote for a person to go to the Electoral College and that was it. Those Electors would actually pick the next President and Vice President.
