4184281,0,t1_crvimk9,I think its a bit different when the act in question is considered by its proponents to be a basic human right. I dont think a lot of people would say that smoking weed is a basic human right to the same degree that consensual sex is. Gays are put in prison in Uganda because of a tyrannical government that oppresses their basic existence. Thats not really a fair comparison.But heres the real reason. If you allow retroactive innocence then to be consistent you also have to allow retroactive punishment. If we were letting people out of jail because the laws were changed it might open the door legally for people to be thrown into jail because the laws were changed. The government has decided that avoiding this potential injustice is worth the injustice that we currently have. As a consequence Ex Post Facto laws are prohibited by the Constitution.,ELIActually5,crx7lre,4,t5_36cfx
