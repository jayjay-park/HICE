Active sniper is fine for execution as you cant be finished with a pistol from across the map whilst downed. It needs to remain a power weapon worth fighting for in execution and the active down keeps it as a power weapon.The Gnasher was broken and inconsistent in the beta but I completely disagree with you when you say it should be the same as GoW. The GoW Gnasher was stupidly strong with hard aim actives.The gnasher should be similar to how it was in GoW in terms of spread and damage drop off at further distances.

I mean that means the beta is somewhere from April to June and the release date for the game will more than likely be Nov  to capitalize on the  year anniversary of Emergence Day. So a beta roughly  to  months before launch is crazy. It means we really might be able to have some significant impact on the final product.It also means there will be some significant bugs and people will need to understand that and not do stupid amounts of bitching.Edit Ok I re read the article. This does not state that the beta starts in Spring merely that if you play UE before March   that you will get early access to the beta. So the beta could happen in October  but you get to play it  day early or something.

You want any player on the west coast to wake up by  AM on a Saturday to play in this tournament because  AM fits better for the east coast. There may only be  player on the west but thats unfair to him. Thats pretty early to play in a small tournament like this. If it was Ti for Dota thats more understandable. Now even if we start at  EST and there is a significant problem players cant connect casters cant cast we will still have the whole day to fix it. Theres no way a  team tournament will last until  even if it starts at  and every issue possible happens. This is so far in advance that every player participating can schedule to dedicate the whole day to gaming so we dont need to worry about going on later than . Everyone should have planned to be able to play that day. And that one west coast player can wake up at a decent time to play and not so early. ,GearsOfWar,cvq8t26,2,t5_2ruzg

7220827,0,t1_d1yx6gx,I agree but also disagree. Gears  was at such a different time. There werent even Xbox Live parties then so anyone who had a mic was in game chat which prompted people to talk. Rarely am I ever in game chat now because Im in a party with my buddies. Back in the day wed be in game chat talking trash and talking with our other teammates.

7254347,0,t3_4er3fx,Game looks awesome but i wish they would have stuck with the Gears  movement speed. I feel like they slowed it down for the casuals.Edit If they slowed down the speed to make up for not having stopping power then i get it. The only reason gears  had stopping power was because the movement speed was so fast that they needed a way to balance out the lancer and make it more viable. I just cant tell from this game play if stopping power is still a thing in this new game.,GearsOfWar,d22rmxh,0,t5_2ruzg

Makes the game more fun because I play harder because I dont want them to do it to me. But in reality you have to remember its just a game!

If were all honest with ourselves this was a very stupid mechanic.   . Its now a timed mechanic which adds a small layer of strategy to your engagements.  You need to plan when you are about to engage and knowing you have a short time for the power advantage it encourages aggressive play.  .

9140446,0,t3_55hek3,For me aka TONSCHUH its still downloading at the moment and I reached now .GB out of .GB.Its true that you should just wait for the download to pick it up again when it pretty much comes to an hold what happens pretty often and seems to be normal.If you pause  resume the game its pretty likely that it will start from scratch and sometimes even refuses to do so which might have to do with the leftover files and folders afterwards.I had still files of .GB in the  appstorerelated folders and were able to start the download again after cleaning up that folders.It seems to help to open just your webbrowser and open  close some sites to increase the downloadspeed a bit after it sloweddown or even comes to a hold.I just keep the GoWForums open and just open Facebook every now and then to get the speed back up again.Good luck everyone !,GearsOfWar,d8am8m7,2,t5_2ruzg

9152031,0,t3_55nl51,I think the biggest thing people worry about most is being able to turn on a dime and gib someone on the same frame they just did a . That isnt possible with Gears  although it is with Gears  because of Center Screen Aiming because you have to wait for your character to rotate because the shot is based on the position of your character and not the camera.Public versus crossplay should be allowed albeit only in unranked and with a crossplay filter setting to turn it off if one so desires but its because MampK wont have that great of an advantage where the only real advantage comes from mid to long range aiming. Movement is easier for most on a controller analog movement is better than digital and the Gnasher sure as hell wont have a giant advantage in the hands of a MampK player because again you have to wait for your character to get into position and changing your control methods wont change that.,GearsOfWar,d8c340i,1,t5_2ruzg

9212486,0,t1_d8jp113,I can see an argument to be made for what youre saying but dont forget that this is almost like The Force Awakens in terms of being rebooted in a sense. It followed a lot in a sense of storytelling but this one just focused on the people or family first. In GoW the COG were already at war with the Locust and its your job to wipe out the Locust Hive with the Lightmass Bomb. In this game however this is very much Seras first introduction to The Swarm so any big climatic blow up the enemy base and escape just in the nick of time wouldve seemed too unrealistic. I know. I just brought up realism in a Gears game but I think how they ended the game for the first in their assuming trilogy was just fine. The Coalition managed to introduce us to all of these new characters and care about them and get us updated towards the end there about what everyone else has been up to since the end of  all while at the same time making us fight robots and a new enemy threat to Sera with in my opinion a very ballsy and rewarding final boss fight.

I played thru the arcade modes of fighting games sooo many times all just to unlock new colors for the characters. I had a lot of fun in the process but I still progressed with those kinds of goals in mind.The introduction of achievements and trophies have only made things worse in this particular instance you are referring to. It feels great to unlock an achievement but for many it has indeed turned games into a chore...a job.

9230062,0,t1_d8lyxbb,Sure developers need more money in order to continue developing absolutely.  However thats why the game is a full priced game and even costs almost as much as two AAAgames for PC and has a season pass that costs more than a single AAAgame on PC if you look around instead of buying directly from SteamOriginUplay.  So theyre getting money alright.  Tournaments in Dota  and CSGO are rarely funded by microtransactions with the exception being Valves own tournaments.  On a side note Dont you get random cards for use in Horde Mode when buying packs in Gears of War ? If thats the case then they sure do affect the game and arent purely cosmetic.

Fractions of seconds just determine too much in gears shotgun battles so connectionhostetc played too big of a role in those games. I think  fixed this personally and the game was nearly perfect if not for the sawedoffretro debacle which got steadily worse as the game aged... As far as the movement and gnasher the game was just about perfect and they took that same formula and put it in this game WITHOUT the headaches from before. Its wonderful.The only thing that is giving me pause so far is the Godburst and the Enforcer.... Right now the Enforcer isnt really a problem because not too many people are using it...

9248479,1,t3_571t5e,The only reason I have Gears  for PC is because I bought a GTX  and it came free. The last time I played the game was before the patch hit and Ive not had the opportunity to try to update the game. If the update breaks the game because Windows Store is terrible its no big loss to me since I didnt pay a dime for this. Ill just uninstall and forget Gears  ever existed.If not for this game coming free with my new GPU I wouldnt have bought this for PC anyway. Games For Windows Live was awful and it failed. This hackneyed attempt of Windows Store in Win looks like itll go the same direction of failure as GFWL did anyway. PC enthusiasts like me build PCs and muck around with our machines do so because of the freedom this platform affords us. Trying to lock us in with Windows versions and the walled garden nonsense Microsoft is trying to hem us gamers into goes against the main tenet of my hobby and PC gaming.

9388270,0,t3_593hfz,Something that could add freshness amp challenge without too drastic changes could be to add modifiers. This could make having a varied party that plays together more rewarding than the ability to have everyone sit on turrets and melt faces. I see this as applying for a set of like    rounds then changing. Maybe on the nonBoss waves then Boss waves are regular. Some challenges could be infantry units must be executed headshot damage is doubled all other is halved same could apply to specific weapon types all majors move double speed a malfunction round where your fortifications dont work but dont take damage energy drops are doubled for the first  seconds they are on the ground I could see them being red then turning to the regular yellow infinite grenades for you and enemies  damage is increased out of cover but decreased in coverI know this is similar to other ideas is other games but having a time to shine because your class is more suited for the current set of circumstances would be something worth playing the variety of classes for.  ,GearsOfWar,d9612q4,1,t5_2ruzg

9487181,0,t3_5aqkfz,it would be a nice idea but from what was created. it seems like the coalition is out to make their own game. they dont want to have old team members to be the main part just be cameos. basically out with the old and in with the new. just like how theyre a new company to take on the reigns to make it their own. which is why many of the previous games weaponry is missing and they added their own. what theyre doing is basically starting from scratch and make this game their beginning. so having a side story of the older characters might not be a path that this team would be willing to go. but yea it would be interesting though itd be more of like judgement where you saw what baird cole and carmine did during the events of gears . but that was because it was a whole new game that was following baird already. ,GearsOfWar,d9ihxy0,3,t5_2ruzg

9616278,0,t3_5cplmt,Because Gears is a hard game. Games like CoD require no skill and let all players succeed whereas those players would get stomped on GearsHalo cry This game sucks and never touch it again. This age of gaming is tailored to bad players having a chance to succeed through mechanics like lag compensation perks streaks and fast TTK. Games that dont do that wont be as popular.Edit Seems to be a fair portion of people butthurt because I spoke the truth so Ill break this circle jerk down a little further.There has been a cyclical nature of shooters like CoD and other twitch shooters in relation to shooters like Gears.CoD has remained popular always sitting atop the population charts. Why? Because it is able to attract and retain casual audience. Why is that you may ask? Because the skill required to do well in a game like CoD is far less than the skill required to do well in Gears and H but well keep this in relation to Gears.So Player A who has limited shooter experience boots up Gears and runs into Player B who has experience with shooters and GoW. Player A gets bodied and thinks damn this isnt fun. He then picks up CoD runs into more experienced players and finishes something like well say . Player A now thinks Im having so much more fun in this game because Im performing better. This is how human psyche works. We dont like doing poorly as it makes us feel bad. Why did he perform better in CoD than Gow though? Because the fast TTK will allow him to kill better players if he sees them first a large majority of the time. Not only that but loadouts help lessen the skill gap as a players ability with even starts doesnt create a large skill gap. Adding on to that generous amounts of lag compensation allow Player A to play on inconsistent networking giving gunfights a flip of the coin feel.Now developing games is an industry. Lots of money is up for grabs and even moreso with microtransactions. Games stand to lose a lot of revenue from DLC sales and Micros if players stop playing so theyll appease to lesser skilled players to keep them engaged. Look at core tuning in GoW for example. Damages are turned up for faster kill times and loadouts allow players to equip something like the  Enforcer so lessexperienced and lesserskilled gnasher users never have to touch the weapon and can still contended with Gnasher users.Look like it or not games that allow players of all experience and skill to play evensteven with each other will always sell more units and have more players on console. Hell so many people will buy CoD and play it for  mins every other day and keep going back because it allows them to feel good from success with little skill and effort required to put forward. I realize that sounds pious and pretentious but its a cold reality of the modern era of gaming.,GearsOfWar,d9yek1i,65,t5_2ruzg

10087593,0,t1_dbmc5m1,gt When you say we all who do you mean exactly? Because everyone that bitches on here seems to care more about cosmetics than anything else. They have removed returning to main menu and rank to try to help fight off quitters but at the end of the day there really isnt much that can be done besides harsher penalties but that can actually cause people to not want to play the game overall. But to say they havent at least tried something is just foolish to say.I understand theyre cosmetics but Gears  had characters to unlock via leveling and challenges. The fact that this is not an option in this game is a step back and people are confused and frustrated as to why Gears  is this way.gt How is the gnasher broken? Should it be nerfed in core? Maybe but everyone has that over powered weapon at their hip so I wouldnt say its exactly broken. Also I dont play horde but your probably right considering I always felt horde was too repetitive personally.The gnasher is broken. TC addressed the visualaudio cue of firing ghost rounds BUT THE GUN STILL DOESNT FIRE SOMETIMES. This is a major issue that was not addressed in UE and doesnt look like it will be addressed here.The overall point is there are many gameplay issues that keep MP from being great but they would rather patch horde spawn trapping or escalation ring boosting and push these shitty skin packs rather than address low server tick rates or a nonfiring gnasher.,GearsOfWar,dbmfis8,1,t5_2ruzg

If you want to play  shouldnt those people be the ones making a private lobby? You keep saying its about making feel better. It isnt. When I play Counter Strike people being punished for leaving doesnt make me feel better. Its just that less people leave because theyll only start up a match if they know they have enough time to complete a bout. Guess what? If you only have  minutes to spare you probably shouldnt queue up for Horde.

10169387,0,t3_5ll24o,Man was I let down...But not by the game I loved it. Huge fan of Gears  and played a lot of Gears . When I played Gears  MP all I could thing of was wow finally Gears  levels of fun again but my shotgun actually works!.What let me down was this sub came here to learn news on the game and maybe watch some videos of people kicking ass but nope only complains about micro and how the gnasher is delayed... !?! is this real? Im no pro I cant tell. To me it seems fine.Before everyone downvotes me to oblivion a little background. First of all I love playing online shooters but Im no pro. That means I dont know details about weapon spread damage and overall mechanics on the game I can only tell if I liked it or not I cant tell why I liked or didnt like.So when I played a crapton of Gears  my overall experience was that I loved the game but it had a ton of issues. First of all Im not from US so every time it took a millennia to find a match most of the time it only worked if I already had a team before starting the search and when it finally happened the lag was so brutal we tested shooting walls at the start of the match anything more than one full second for the bullet to hit the wall we quit the match one second was ok though.So thats what I mean by my shotgun actually works that it actually just takes a few milliseconds for shots to register. Anyone here that has technical knowledge to say what Gears has the best gnasher please understand I was also fighting lag and now I mostly dont.Gears  I remember the first DLC came out and you needed it to play ranked. Good bye Gears .So when Gears  came out suddenly I had A MP mode that actually works for me and finds matches most of the time. The MP is fun and action packed. A nice enough SP Gears  is still highlight of the series for me. I can always play ranked because new maps in ranked are free for everyone. Even if the micro is BS its only for skins. For someone whos used to have no unlocks from Gears  having unlocks even if it takes years to open  duplicates is good enough.It may seem I only liked Gears  because its good enough but actually Im mentioning lag and other technical aspects because those I can explain  I have no way of explaining how and why Im having fun with a game. It just clicked for me like it clicked in the Gears  days and my only regret is that my old group of online Gears friends are no more and this game is so much more fun playing with friends...,GearsOfWar,dbwr81r,21,t5_2ruzg

Instead of taking up slots for retextured characters they should have set it up like weapon skins  weapon model gt click weapon gt gt Skins menu. Like a drop down menu or submenu not a disorganized  slots for the same character to make it look like theres more characters than there really are.Imagine having to scroll through all the weapon skins as if they were different weapon models like having to scroll through all the character skins as if theyre different characters.

10747142,0,t1_ddogxlq,My problem with your argument is that horde isnt versus.  A good player can carry a lot of bad ones I agree but why.  The classes arent all equal and I dont enjoy having to carry low level players.  If you dont mind thats fine but I really wish that matches were set up in a way where doing that wasnt necessary.The damage output of a low level player that isnt doing their role just isnt enough for an effective team and Gears is all about teamwork which means communication.  If youre playing matches without talking to your team mates to announce downs or damage sponges that need concentrated fire or flankers youre doing yourself and everyone else a disservice.  It requires so little effort on your part to quickly say three words into the mic its just so lazy not to do it.A low level indicates a player is inexperienced which means that theyre still learning the game.  A sniper that misses several shots in a row is worthless compared to a level  soldier plinking away chest shots with a lancer.  Most of you are console gamers and are aiming a sensitive nonclingy Halo style reticle with the tip of your thumb at a moving target.  Scout is all about survivability and burst damage if youre just using him to hoover energy then hes not contributing much during the waves.So the match you described one with a shit scout a nonDPS sniper a couple of white damage soldiers and a high level heavy  that seems a little bit imbalanced.  Like the contributions will mostly be coming from the competent player who came into the match prepared and outfitted.  But who would want to be that guy?  Do all the work and then the rewards are pretty evenly meted out.

11024841,0,t1_dehmad2,How has anything Ive said been bullshit? You literally dont read or know how to construct an actual intelligent argument. I gave you facts and you REFUSE to see reason. You havent rebutted anything I said you just come up with a different thing to argue about.  I never said the games only issue was the shit gnasher. I cited MULTIPLE flaws in the game that you just choose to gloss over because yes you are taking part in the TC circle jerk. Using your own words THEY NEED TO IMPROVE. You literally just said that. Why are you arguing when you yourself said they need to get better at fixing flaws? You just sound dumb.One positive doesnt outweigh the negatives. What kind of childish logic are you following? Just because maps are free does not excuse TC from weak map design or taking away maps from the rotation. In response to needing Microtransactions for free DLC I already said that many companies handle it better than TC. Titanfall  and Rainbow Six Siege both have free updates with microtransactions and neither feel like they go against fans. You dont need to screw the playerbase to make money. You realize baseless support of TC isnt original either right? Were both allowed to have our opinions despite them being held by multiple other people on this sub. I dont have to prove shit to you. Just look at the countless posts on this sub concerning the INCONSISTENCIES of the gnasher.

11538595,0,t1_dg2rh05,Thank you for getting back to me. Unfortunately I havent had any improvements. I tried what you suggested by power cycling my Xbox after signing out of everything. No changes for my PC after rebooting everything and things synced up. So far Ive tried running WSREST.exe signing out of the Xbox app rebooting my PC fully reinstalling Gears  reinstalling the Xbox app but to no avail.Theres also a advanced option in the Apps amp Features settings for Win  that says If this app isnt working right reset it so I reset the Windows Store Gears  and the Xbox app rebooted resigned in but still saying that the season pass is missing. I did see that this is a trending topic on the Gears forums though. Im glad you guys are looking into it cause it doesnt seem like theres much more I can do. ,GearsOfWar,dg3whc8,1,t5_2ruzg

Im not sure what theyre basing map remaking decisions on but there are better and more popular maps to bring back. All the maps should be in rotation. Doesnt make any sense. Also impact dark should not count as a separate map. One version is enough.
