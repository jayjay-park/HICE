9262395,0,t3_56z4d8,I found this episode a real mind fuck. Its made me question the whole nature of what we are listening to. I had in my mind that we are the patient listening to the tapes. But that concept of what is happening in real time is irrelevant. All we are hearing are the tapes made by Hestia. We dont know anything about the reality outside that.All we can be sure of is that there is a womans voice speaking English with various sound effects in the background. There seems to be a real life narration patient brought to an institute for reeducation and getting sneakily advised how they can escape. But how do we know know any of that is true? Could the person we call Hestia just be someone making all this up and recording stuff into a tape for her own amusement. Is she mad? Is she in the institute as a patient and allowed to record things for her own amusement. That would make sense of that circular referencing about cameras and wires. The weird recursive nature of letting your mind travel within the wires through the camera to the camera room to look at as screen and seeing yourself letting your mind travel through the wires.....eek.I almost see at as a meta statement on podcasting. We the patient are being provided with tapes podcasts to reeducate us entertain provoke enlighten to escape our boring situation work home car public transport. But really there is no escape  only a temporary drift into a temporary more alive reality. We must come back to reality  the institute. And what was with the carpentry noises? I didnt grasp that at all. Something to do with what was being put in her mouthjaw  something involving a saw  or maybe a drill? That might indicate something being put into her teeth maybe a tracking device. Or something to cloak her voice? And what is the constant referring to remembering to breathe. Dont forget to breathe. Are the patients possibly dead zombies maybe being brought back to life via some unnatural science or virus. They have to remember to breathe. The other patients have a zombie shuffling feel to them.Or is this ability to let your mind imagine almost a superpower that Hestia is trying to develop in the patient. Was the patient brought there because she has some sort of out of body mind powers? Its almost like she has the power to use her mind to fight the drugs and get yogic like psychosomatic control over her body such as blood vessel opening and closing.Im getting more and more intrigued by this story. Its just so hard to pin down.,withinthewires,d8q2pmw,3,t5_3eg5j
