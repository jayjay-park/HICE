3683288,0,t1_cq9w2dc,Nahhhh Natas I know it wasnt UN. Was just some KoS bambi camper. Literally right after reset he was camping the back hill of the junkyard. Oneshotted my friend and then tied me up while i came back to consciousness and he was looting. Broke free and it put a gun in my hands and he instantly shot me. He then apologized and said hed drag everything off our bodies so we could come back and get it. Little did we know he was still camping the area and waiting for his friends to come get it haha.Ive spent  hours on your guys servers. Seen you guys rolling a few times but never approached. Heard good things about you guys but Im a little too cautious of a player to approach a group of  people no matter what the reputation is.,DayZUNServers,cqc4aza,2,t5_379mv
5030002,0,t3_3jtz7z,Normally when youre running with a group of players everyone will desync at the same time and youll KNOW theres a camp nearby. Lots of players leave barrels in the water so that lake the only one nearby is a logical place to look. Since it wasnt in the water I assume they looked nearby at the rocks.,DayZUNServers,cusb2ed,2,t5_379mv
5061865,0,t1_cuw4k72,gtLets be real here. Dallas knew where our camp was. You knew that Dallas knew where our camp was. He mentioned it several times that he knew. You followed him knowing you were going to be stealing from us.gtHow naive would we be to just let you all walk away even though you were well informed that you were stealing from us? Had we not showed up you would all be gallivanting across chernarus with two tents worth of loot. gtPeople seem to be under the impression that we allow anyone who surrenders to walk away with everything no matter what their crimes. This is not the case. Surrendering does not give you a get out of jail free card. gtAll of that being said we let you guys come back and get your gear. How many people have you been killed by that allowed you to come back and get your gear? I bet that number can be counted on two hands. Weve been playing with you long enough to know youre a cool guy. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time so we gave you the benefit of the doubt. I fully expect you to kill me if you catch me looting your tent as well.True true. However that tent had like  zucchinis in it lol. Even then I can see your point base raiding does call for a new ROE. ,DayZUNServers,cuw59pv,1,t5_379mv

7094280,0,t1_d1k2xhg,Isnt hiding barrels exactly the same way... Anybody can take the blame for placing them and there is no way to verify who has placed them beside catching them in the act or having them admit it. Snipps even verifies this when he talks about having to ask around if anybody placed barrels in the church at Pavlovo. If it was as easy to monitor as you claim then he could have just checked the logs.,DayZUNServers,d1ki86z,1,t5_379mv
