1922321,0,t3_2gnlzm,Okay sweetie take a deep breath and take a moment to be proud of everything that you have managed to overcome in your life.  Dealing with anxiety depression and an eating disorder is a lot for one person to handle but look at where you are in spite of all of that.  Youve accomplished some pretty amazing things already!Now expat life is really hard.  I am currently living in England Im from the US and I can relate to how youre feeling.  The first few months are the hardest as youre trying to adjust to a completely new way of living.  Plus the seasons are changing the days are getting shorter and the change in the amount of sunlight can have big negative affects on your mood.  As far as making friends its really hard anywhere you go especially if youre immersed in an unfamiliar culture.  In my case Ive been here over a year now and I havent made any friends on my own one of the downsides of being a stayathome parent.  What helps me is to keep in contact with my friends and family back home and this is where the evil Facebook comes in handy and to get out and do something physical like walking around the village or going to the gym.  Making life work as an expat is about finding new modes of operation and new methods of coping with stress.Now that being said if you absolutely feel like you would be better off going back home then that is what you should do.  Getting out and experiencing the world isnt worth it if you have to sacrifice your mental health to do it.  So you tried something new and it didnt work out for the bestand that is perfectly okay.  The fact that you tried is amazing!  And whats even better is learning to listen to yourself and respect how youre feeling.  You put yourself in a new situation and you learned something about yourself in the processthat is not failure in my book.So big hugs to you and know that no matter what you choose to do you are making the right decision for you.  ,FreeCompliments,ckktqvp,10,t5_2wmnh

From my experience and speaking with some of the people Ive gotten to talk to I can tell you that everyone has a story behind their eyes. Im glad I was able to make you smile now pay it forward!

My best friend in college went on a date behind my back with the guy Id had had a crush on for a year.  He and I spent a lot of time together and were quite close and I really believed it would turn into more.She finally told me. It broke my heart in two ways.  I loved them both enough to want them to be happy but loved myself enough to not force myself to watch it happen.  I stopped talking to him and she and I had a long talk and basically our friendship ended.It was really hard. But so goes life and honestly as it sometimes does it turned out for the best.  They ended up married and apparently happy. And so did I! My husband is far better suited for me and he makes me incredibly happy.Funny twist is that now I am best friends with my old best friends sister. DItll work out but do whats best for you.

9933659,0,t3_5ho7wj,Im not sure if I felt the same way you did before. I was always scared of conversations because theyre completely unpredictable. I used to imagine scripts of every way a conversation could possibly go so that I could be prepared to talk to people. I did that so much that now in conversation Ill ask a question and be prepared for a follow up right away because I already thought of it before the other person said anything. Maybe that might help you?I also was never able to go shopping before because it was too unpredictable for me. Was I going to walk into someone I knew? Were people staring at me when I was shopping? Am I taking too long as the cash register? I dont think about these things anymore because I forced myself in much more awkward situations so these wouldnt bother me anymore. I think you can overcome it. I believe you can. Videos like this really helped me. Theres another one I cant find but basically it explained that in conversation we should ask more questions so we have more to talk about and the other person is more willing to talk because theyre talking about themselves. I know I didnt have compliments but hopefully this helps you. My compliment is that you can overcome this.

She had so many times she wanted to quit and thats when I told her to work on her portfolio work more often as she had been neglecting projects that were fun for her.

10071562,0,t3_5gh6q3,Its been a pretty tough year. I got clean from a  year heroin addiction  on January st so my one year anniversary is coming right up.  Unfortunately my marriage collapsed just a few months later and my wife and two sons moved out and Im currently going through divorce. I had been a stay at home dad for a few years also taking care of my wifes grandmother who suffered from dementia. I was a mostly functional addict and I have a very close relationship with the kids.  The kids are hers from a previous marriage but I raised them for most of their lives. Their biological father is not in their lives at all. Unfortunately I wasnt a very good husband as my addiction took priority over my marriage and by the time I was finally able to get it together it was too late. My sobriety came at a pretty high price. But since Ive gotten clean my life has improved dramatically. All of the friends that I cut out of my life are now back and they have been extremely supportive. The problem is  Ive just barely been scraping by. When my wife and I separated she moved out of the house and left me with the lease and I had no income at all. I ended up having to get rid of most of my stuff and put the stuff I really care about in storage and stay with one of my friends. Every month Ive barely made enough to pay for the storage space but Im almost out of options and time. If I dont come up with the money by the first of the month which will also be my  year anniversary theyre going to sell my last material and personal possessions. Every night I lay awake trying to come up with some kind of plan to fix this situation.  I feel like Ive done everything right this year. Ive accepted the fact that Im going to have to completely start my life over at  but I could really use some advice on what I should do. Thanks for listening and Happy Holidays everyone. ,FreeCompliments,dbkci3w,7,t5_2wmnh

I cant believe you noticed! Sorry that was a really long parentheses but your eyes are absolutely gorgeous! What I love about this picture is that you can see each of your eyes looking very differently in different light. They both look great.On another note something that Ive always thought about people with beautiful eyes is that no matter what with age physical attractiveness is going to fade. So having a pair of eyes that a guy could get lost into forever is a good thing that I bet people dont think about enough.

11158995,0,t3_5zaogv,Okay first off physical appearance is superficial so believe me when I say that what is on the inside that counts. Not everyone will think you are the prettiest person around I can attest to that but someone will see you for you and thats the person or people friends included that you want to hold onto. It takes time sometimes I wish it didnt take so long but the wait is worth it when you find the one I promise. Itll make the years of feeling worthless disappear and make you wonder why you ever felt that way in the st place. So be better than me understand now that you are beautiful and that you are loved. Maybe Im off track but I hope this hit somewhere. I think you look just right and someday I hope you see it too. Much love hope you have a better week than you have been having. If you need anything feel free to message me anytime.,FreeCompliments,dewuz0i,5,t5_2wmnh

11267275,0,t3_60j3eo,Dont stop crying until you are done. This mourning may seem unpruductive but really when you think about it these are the most beautiful tears you can ever cry. It is a testament to the strength and importance of the relationship you shared. Each tear is a little affirmation of how much you loved each other. And when we cry our brains release hormones that help us feel a little better.Now should it go on for too long and it is starting to negatively impact your day to day life in a long term way there are grief councillors who know exactly how to help you cope with your emotions without invalidating the meaning behind them.Best of luck with this time in your life I hope the memories live on in a happier way for the rest of your life!,FreeCompliments,df94nmo,1,t5_2wmnh
11346034,0,t1_dfi178m,I suppose it depends what you mean genuinely care about though. I think people should have the ability to talk with someone who has a interest in your well being. This generally ends up being a family member or friend. Not everyone has this outlet or need anonymity that the Internet provides. I think other people recognize this fact and attempt to be this outlet in some capacity whether its in the form of long period of vested interest or in the form of passing a compliment to someone who feels they need it. It may not be on the same level as checking in with someone everyday or something  but it can be a small but meaningful part of someones day.  ,FreeCompliments,dfi1wuc,3,t5_2wmnh
