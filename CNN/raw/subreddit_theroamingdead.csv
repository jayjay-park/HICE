11067576,0,t3_5y1eq5,Great post.  I totally agree cliffhangers can be very effective when they are used correctly.  Fortunately the comic has gotten it right when it comes to its use of them.,theroamingdead,demhzfp,6,t5_3j4fm

11105472,0,t1_deqs3ou,Not exactly originally I went with Kenny. I liked both of them as characters but after seeing the different outcomes and how they interact with Season  I chose to replay it and made the decision to let Kenny die and abandon Jane. It left less open ends and was easier to place in the timeline that way.,theroamingdead,deqsnns,2,t5_3j4fm
11459363,0,t3_63js52,Cant believe Sherry went fullcrazy like that. Kind of disappointing to be honest. I thought she was more of a calmcalculated villain that could have been kept around for a while. Itll be interesting to see whether The Saviors attack or surrender now that shes dead but Id hate to see it all end with Negan or Dwight going back to keep them in check. Thats just too predictable.,theroamingdead,dfuwtak,10,t5_3j4fm

11470513,0,t3_61nm4y,After reading todays issue this question in more relevant! Sherry and Rick talking about sanity in the world as it is now definitely makes you think about the absolutely fucked up things Rick has done to stay alive. Sometimes it was more than just staying alive like you mentioned with the Hunters and Id also like to add the marauders. He fucking gutted those guys held their intestines in his hands is how I believe Abraham put it. And everything Rick has become has rubbed off on Carl I think.,theroamingdead,dfw6dso,2,t5_3j4fm

11591697,0,t3_65ej4r,I dont see the need. between the show and rereading the comic I really dont see what purpose it would serve. theres nothing in the comic that would be better animated than it already exists on the page.,theroamingdead,dg9xdx8,1,t5_3j4fm
