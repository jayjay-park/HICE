3485299,0,t1_cppjmea,Its strongly implied in this articleIll try to find the one where the dev explained he was required to make the protagonist white because POC were audience limiting.EDIT I have no problem with games that use a male power fantasy protagonist and use women as rewards and decorations. I just dont buy them.,GamerGateDebates,cppjrz9,1,t5_37idx
