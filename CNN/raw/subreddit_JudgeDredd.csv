6133151,0,t3_3zjar8,Surely the original is also a directors cut albeit an episodic one because it was his project. Maybe by he just means its all episodes in one.,JudgeDredd,cymrwpr,1,t5_2ufff
6243040,0,t1_cyz8h72,I understand that itd be neat if they even laced relevant flashbacks into the story relating his origin to whatever crime hes dealing with. Im just hoping it doesnt become a pure origin story. I would love to see throwbacks to Dark Judges and the Apocalypse War. I cant imagine the cheese factor of the robot wars and Call Me Kenneth would translate well though.I feel like the movie was a great origin to Anderson but now we need to see her evolve into the more mature and confident Anderson that was in the comics. I love Olivia Thirlby and Id love to see her break out into the mainstream as Judge Anderson.,JudgeDredd,cyz9kis,2,t5_2ufff
