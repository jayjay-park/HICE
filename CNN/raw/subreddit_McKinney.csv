7546339,0,t3_4g26b0,Yes Ive hired them for basic work. They are not bad but most either dont speak English or pretend not to. They leave trash every where haggle the price again after the work is done and are very mediocre workers. Most are completely unskilled but will tell you otherwise. They are mostly picked up by crew managers who are up to be a contact point they stay on their ass and watch them. They do the screening to make sure they are skilled in whatever activity you require etc. If you need a day laborer I would go to craigslist first and if you need a bugger job done u would go to a crew guy handyman who can do the screening for you and oversee the job. Well worth the headache to do it legit instead.,McKinney,d2zzd09,2,t5_2sblf

11663378,0,t3_667rqx,D Maker Tree in Richardson is a D shop I use for work. They sell parts and do repairs but it may depend what you have. His machines and materials seem to be pretty high end. Open after  pm. Hes a night owl.,McKinney,dgi24mp,1,t5_2sblf
11804845,0,t1_dgx9iu8,My father got in a really good relationship with one of the managers who then decided to go open his own restaurant La Cima near Van Alstyne. The drive is so worth it absolutely fantastic from what Ive had so far.,McKinney,dgy4byr,1,t5_2sblf
