6454932,0,t1_czmyke7,We have a quasianechoic measurement setup using standard acoustic absorbersdiffusers and a gated measurement system meaning that the computer emits a short burst of sound turns the mic on only for the time period that the sound waves are passing by the mic and then turns the mic off for the duration of the reflections.  Its quite accurate down to around Hz at which point we will either make nearfield measurements or ground plane measurements in our parking lot.We spec drivers to our factory if we cant find something we already own but we dont personally build them here.  What do you mean by spatial visualizations? ,loudspeakers,czmzdef,1,t5_30f05
