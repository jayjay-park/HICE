1983041,0,t3_2hauto,Great article. After casually tuning in and out over the years I have been regularly watching TNA. Everything they do just feels much fresher than WWEs angles. When I was watching Lashleys match with Roode I had legitimately no idea who would win. Lashley is dominant but Roode was being pushed as the longest reigning champ in TNA history. I was marking out when the ref kicked MVP and Kenny King out of the arena. Then just when it looked like Roode was going to win he hurts his leg and Lashley capitalizes. Compare this to the WWE. The belt tends to circulate between two or three guys and thats it. Also their big ppv title matches seem to always go the same way. The face gets his ass handed to him at the beginning and then makes a serious come back towards the end. The best example of this is the Wrestlemania Triple Threat with Orton Bryan and Batista. Three quarters of the match was  Bryan getting the shit kicked out of him. It made sense logically but  it was pretty boring to watch.edit Decided to elaborate a little more.,TNA,cks5nv8,1,t5_2sidt

3416432,0,t1_cphoo7u,Perhaps too dominant.  Im not in favor of bringing back the KO Tags since they were largely a way to get more women on TV in a short amount of time and thus an excuse for ignoring and denigrating the division.

8633610,0,t1_d6klc48,Im actually really hopeful that it will lead to some new match psychologies in the company and possibly a more oldschool style in the division.  Id love to see the two belts distinguished by style as a result of the stipulations put on them.  It gives a great reason in kayfabe for why someone would want one and not the other or why one person would compete more regularly in one division.  It may also force wrestlers to rethink their styles which is always good creatively.,TNA,d6kt45d,3,t5_2sidt

9149126,0,t3_55l12g,Just carrying over my thoughts from rsc... EddieRex have no chemistry and Aron is a guy that desperately needs a welldefined character to succeed. He cant just go like Edwards can and get people interested. MooseMiracle and the Womens match were okay. Kind of expected more from BennettMoose but Moose is limited. Eli Drake winning the battle royal is great. Good job getting all the lads on the show except Everett wtf? and Drake was the right choice to win it. Trevor Lee vs DJZ was MOTN nonHardys division. Awesome work at doing everything the CWC guys wish they could go out and do. DJZ has come so far in his career Im really happy hes gotten over and the company are behind him.

9181583,0,t3_560y6z,I know this sounds weird but Im kind of ok with WWE owning the library. TNA is putting on excellent matches and great feuds but their name holds them back. They needed to shed this identity. This also forces them to adapt to survive. Theres no more leaning on the past now. They cant go back. It also means Corgan is going to have to put his money where his mouth is which hes been trying to do for awhile. He has a vision. Let him see his vision through.
