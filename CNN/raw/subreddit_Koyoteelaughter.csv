2987265,0,t3_2uddpu,Great story great ending. What I really liked best about this novel was the highly graphical and dense writing style. No blank pages so to speak. The jumps in time and place in the storyline where nicely done in my opinion  well coordinated and not too confusing. There where a couple of things I found questionable in the logic such as how Luke and Leia seemed to be alien to the very idea of personal names yet everyone else seemed to have one but they where minor and didnt impact the story too much as a whole.TLDR awesome novel and Moooooooor!,Koyoteelaughter,co7ml4b,13,t5_35utt

3122935,0,t3_2vvq7b,Thank you so much for this always looking for the next chapter at work was up till about am for nights reading the first book just could not put it down. Just sad that Im caught up having to find other stuff to do till you post another chapter. As always we want more. Where I live they have a drive in movie theater and I always have to get a funnel cake they really are amazing. How much would you make off each book so I know about what to donate ,Koyoteelaughter,colow0z,2,t5_35utt
3161964,0,t3_2wd4k6,Another fine entry.  Very interesting take on the reprinting.  Is Tessa Jesus?  Dies in her attempts to save humanity goes through hell and rises in three days? On a side note I didnt realize you wrote the story about the monster Nathan.  I read that when you wrote it I guess almost a year ago.  Anywho I thought you may want to link it to your subreddit because its a really neat story.  If you have any other hidden WP stories you should add them too.  Youre an excellent writer you should show off your old stuff too.,Koyoteelaughter,copqi6r,3,t5_35utt

3518015,0,t1_cpt84da,I agree as well as make for an insanely complicated story.  Just imagine trying to make love to Leia just to have Baako show her jealousy halfway through. I really hope that Daniel continues to choose the hard option and allow Baako the benefit of doubt and allow her to reenter.  I prefer that over Wheately any day.  ,Koyoteelaughter,cpta363,3,t5_35utt

3978854,0,t1_cr9tgkm,I think that youre forgetting something. When the ships left Cojo they were nearly empty. The people on the ships are colonists that were  harvested. Theyre ingratiating theirselves into a society they dont fully understand yet. Most of the people on the ships have never been to Cojo. Also each level in the ship is essientially a state. Every ship is a country. Every neighborhood is a city. There are the people youve indicated and there are advanced parts of the society. We just havent gotten into those parts yet. Im saving those for when the ships leave Earth.,Koyoteelaughter,cr9tmgv,2,t5_35utt

4319949,0,t1_csckt6m,Youre going to laugh. I pulled the name Wheatley from Portals . I patterned him after a fanboy stereotype. Heavy set reasonably confident flippant comedic imaginative witty and an overall liar who exaggerates everything and lives in the middle of his fantasies.The reason Im writing this online for free is primarily for the feed back. I figure if I write in real time Ill get feed back that will make me a better writer. For a while I was getting good feedback. Now I have my core readers who comment all the time and I love their feedback but itd be nice to get some brutal feedback from the other readers.,Koyoteelaughter,cscl5eq,2,t5_35utt

I forgot the name and even where Id read it and all I remembered was the Baron of Reid because of how layered he is and what he said to Pemphero after their last fight.Your characters and  your exploration of human nature and these philosophical concepts which are woven into your stories delight me. Its really refreshing to explore these subjects while reading a juicy story like the one you have created and continue to create. Thank you. ,Koyoteelaughter,cu0oqfe,1,t5_35utt

7015325,0,t3_4a0iac,Couple questionsWhere did Daniel get the info about the Emperor having been a symbiote since the beginning of the third age?Does this aeonic leeching limitation mean that Giancarlo is a symbiote as well?There have been a few references to the possibility of some of the original colonists surviving to modern times. Wouldnt the aeonic leeching limitation have prevented this? If not wouldnt all that time necessitate many replacement implants? Did they have the infrastructure required to perform the implant replacements? If so shouldnt they have also had the ability to sustain civilization and prevent the loss of knowledge of their origins which presumably occurred on every colonized world?How was the Emperor able to use an aeonic implant after being reprinted? I thought they didnt work on reprints?Good chapter BTW. I love infodumps.,Koyoteelaughter,d1bja40,1,t5_35utt

10270711,0,t1_dc865a3,I like describing Daniels power. Just the thought of him being about to throw a slab of rock  feet wide by  feet long and twenty feet thick a quarter mile gives me goosebumps. Back on Earth in Warlocks he talks about being able to raise a mountain range from the flat Kansas prairies. Instead of doing that though he throws a slab of stone a quarter mile like its nothing. I love this character and the slow buildup to what he is truly capable of.I could have  had him turn into a cloud of dust but this seemed so much more satisfying.,Koyoteelaughter,dc88p8t,5,t5_35utt
