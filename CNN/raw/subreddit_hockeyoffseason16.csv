7898958,0,t3_4nesz1,As fun as I think a draft style system could be I would prefer using a first come first serve system. That way I or someone else would be far more likely to be able to GM a team they actually know something about. I know a lot about Montreal so I think I would have a lot more fun GMing Montreal as I know the weak points and places of excess. If I were to GM Carolina for example I would be totally lost as I dont know much about Carolina.Just my  cents. I wouldnt be upset if we did the draft but Id rather the choice.,hockeyoffseason16,d43x0h4,3,t5_3e4st
