491397,1,t1_cfw417l,Ha!  Good point about the Home Run but regardless of that pitchs outcome Id still have the same feeling about his performance.All I was noting is that so far hes gotten away with a ton of pitches that he shouldnt have and a longball was sure to arrive shortly.  Yes its Spring Training and youre  right.  I was simply remarking that he doesnt seem to have good command of his fastball right now.  Hes not walking batters but thats simply because his fastball is missing inside the zone not out of it.  The old pitching adage is if you miss miss down.  Currently hes missing over the middle of the plate and up in the zone with his fastball.  Cant say Im thrilled to see that.But once again it is Spring Training and this is no way what Im expecting to see once the season begins.  Im simply analyzing what I see.,NYYankees,cfw4ilw,-1,t5_2rp0g

1417472,0,t3_2ad9e8,I was on vacation out west in Laguna for the week and decided to go to the Espn zone at downtown disney in Anaheim to watch the game with my little brother. We had just gotten our food and I remember how fucking pissed off I was when they hit arod but also happy as hell with the way Girardi reacted. Of course the place had some random college football replays sound on instead of the game so I couldnt hear a thing. My Facebook was filled with fellow fans from back home talking about what happened and my phone also blew up with texts. It was pretty crazy because I was so angry. We eventually moved to the hotel bar for some whiskey and saw the Gardner triple. Went back to espn zone to play some games and watch the end of the ballgame. For me even though I was across the country itll be one of those moments where Ill always remember where I was and what I was doing when it all went down. Pretty damn awesome that they came away with the victory in the end. Also goddamn that arod home run was super sweet. He should have walked around the bases.

Besides the thread is about Cashmans biggest mistake not things that occurred during his tenure he had nothing to do with.         Ultimately ownership decided to override his decision on that so again that had nothing to do with Cashman. What do you expect Cashman to do? Threaten to quit if they resign ARod? Cashman still reports up to HankHal. Hank resigned ARod. Its one of the main reasons we dont see Hank involved anymore because they knew it was a colossal mistake.        George pulled the same stunt when Cashman recommended they sign Vlad Guerrero but George wanted Gary Sheffield so he worked out the deal himself and cut Cashman out of the process.

Im not saying anyone should blame Jeter for not wanting to move off SS or for asking for more money but if another player went to the owner after missing an entire season and asked for a  million raise the press would not be as kind. And no the deal didnt save the Yankees luxury tax. It was simply the Yankees giving Jeter a couple of million to preserve the peace. ,NYYankees,cky0aox,2,t5_2rp0g

Theyve already lost out on Lester and with Shields currently rumored to be talking with the Cubs they might decide to make a run at Scherzer.

Also they signed a guy named Prince Fielder who they then traded for a B named Ian Kinsler whos still around. Other than Scherzer there is literally no one else they havent been able to keep around in a money sense.gtAlso  in  starts isnt worth the  million theyre paying.Stop caring about pitcher winloss records. They mean basically nothing. They are paying David Price to pitch well which he is doing. He has no control over if his offense decides to score runs that day or not.gtWere gonna have to see how hes going at the all start break but dont act like its been all fine for price and Detroit.It hasnt but Price is one of about the  best pitchers in baseball and he still is right now on this very day.

Severinos offspeed pitches are significantly better.This means that having a slider curveball and changesplit is  pitches which is a more diverse arsenal than a changeslider combination which is only  pitches. Eovaldi is therefore a more complete product. This recent spate of excellence by him is not a mistake. People are still in the honeymoon phase with Severino and they overinflate his value.

4935827,0,t1_cugos7s,gtHaving GDTs brigaded is annoying but most of the Jays fans arent bad. No need to be a dick to them just because there are some bad apples who try trolling usThanks for posting this.  I learned this exact thing last year too.  The majority of us just stick to posting mainly in our own sub like Im sure you guys and the rest of teams fans do.  I posted this in our sub a few minutes ago hoping the rest of you guys see it tooI remember Orioles fans coming into our GDTs last year and downvote brigading us to no end as well.  When I went to their sub to ask around and investigate I found out that they had known trolls who go out and do these things.  But what I also found was that the majority of the fans in there were nice people and they disliked their trolls as much as we did if not more for how it makes their sub look.  I think were going through the same thing now.I think every team or at least every team thats winning has its segment of fanstrolls with nothing better to do.  Ive come to expect it now and no longer judge a teams sub based on the actions of their few.Good luck and I hope you can enjoy the rest of your season in peace no matter how it turns out This is just the nature of reddit baseball fandom and fandom in general I believe.

Drafting in the top  does not ensure a future HOF piece where the probability is higher in other sports like basketball. The bust chance is higher.I understand your thinking though.Plus weve won  of our last  and should take  from KC tonight. Eovaldi may have to throw some more breaking pitches because KC loves the fastball but hes looked really good recently. All of this essentially without Ells and ARod with the recent neck spasms bothering Tex as well.I like the way this team gets chances and guys on base and we are getting better with RISP.

But no the Yanks stood with him until he was physically finished until there was  chance that he could still produce.    He had to be about the worst player in the majors last year that was the real reason he retired.Ellsbury isnt a distraction or problem to the team at all.  The issue with Ellsbury is hes paid too much for what he is.   A guy who can still run and play CF isnt someone you need to just cut from the roster.   There may be times he gets hot over the rest of his deal to the point that he might be tradable.   My guess is long term he ends up being an overpaid th OFer and DH at times.

10725083,0,t1_ddm7670,Thats just not true.gtWith plus bat speed and quick strong wrists Mateo isnt your slapperspeed type. He has exceptional bat control and his approach and discipline improved over the course of the year. There is potential for a plus hit tool but he still struggles with getting too aggressive as well as recognizing offspeed. Mateo is a pure  runner and his speed is an intimidating force for opponents forcing defenders to work faster and make them uncomfortable. His plus throwing arm plays well as does his lateral range in getting to hit balls.So lets track what was touched upon in just this snippet from BP Plus bat speed strong wrists exceptional bat control improved discipline.  Potential plus hit tool.  Pure  runner.  Throwing arm and lateral range both play well at SS. The only tool not touched upon as having positives are his power which many say could be around  HR. From BAgtAs ever Mateo is still blessed with grade speed on the  scouting scale. How the Yankees want to employ it however is another question. That level of speed will play in the outfield and Mateo saw time in instructional league in center field. He plays average defense at shortstop and second base leading multiple evaluators to project center as his best path to the big leagues. Hes got plenty of bat speed to catch up to good fastballs but still has rough edges to polish at the plate. He showed a vulnerability to breaking balls though he should be an average hitter with surprising power for his wiry frame.To summarize Average defense  at BSS Plus in the OF .  Average hit tool   Surprising power ??? Obvious grade speed. This isnt a Rico Noel future pinch runner no bat no field player. This is a guy who can be what Billy Hamilton was supposed to be with a little SB and more HR. ,NYYankees,ddm7ntb,6,t5_2rp0g
10726080,0,t3_5tf8n6,This is an exciting time to be a Yankees fan. We are rebuilding with a lot of talent in the minors primed to hit in the next couple years. A lot of the players youve heard of Alex Rodriguez Mark Teixeira Carlos Beltran Brian McCann are gone. We are no longer the team that tries to buy a pennant by trading away all our prospects and signing overpriced free agents. Thats the Red Sox now. Joe Girardi is the manager and he tends to go by the numbers as opposed to a gut feeling. People call it the binder usually sarcastically. Any time an oldtimer wants to second guess Girardi hell say he needs to throw away the binder. Brian Cashman is the GM and last year he proved himself a genius by trading away a lot of veterans for top prospects. If people refer to Cahmoney or Cahgod thats who were talking about. As a recovering Knicks fan youll be happy to know we dont talk about ownership much anymore. George Steinbrenner is dead and his sons run the team but it seems they are mostly hands off. John Sterling does the radio play by play and he invents cheesy home run calls for Yankee hitters that are puns on the players name. So if a new player comes up and hits a home run people will ask what was Sterlings home run call. You can play along and try to guess his Matt Holliday call. Im guessing it will be a Madonna shoutout Holliday! Celebrate!Gary Sanchez was last years rookie sensation and everybody loved him. Hes a catcher. Greg Bird was the  rookie sensation but he got hurt and missed all of last year so we are happy to have him back. He plays first base and will likely share time with Chris Carter who we just got as a free agent. This is not the former football player for the Eagles and Vikings. Starlin Castro is the second baseman we got him from the Cubs last year. Hes been around awhile so people are always surprised how young he is  he turns  next month. Were probably going to trade him if anyone wants him. Didi Gregorius is the shortstop. Hes from Curaao and he was knighted by the Queen of the Netherlands. His name is pronounced DD not Die Die. Chase Headley is the third baseman and thats all I have to say about that. Brett Gardner is one of the last links to the last World Series team. Hes fast but is picky about when hes going to steal bases. We probably will trade him. He plays left field and is fun to watch. Jacoby Ellsbury is the center fielder. He was a big free agent signing and he has been a disappointment. We would trade him if anyone would take him. Right field is another rookie Aaron Judge. Hes very big  . We also have Matt Holliday who we just signed this off season. He will be DH and maybe play outfield once in awhile. Aaron Hicks was an outfielder we got last year who couldnt hit but Girardi kept playing him. Throw away the binder Joe!We also have Tyler Austin and Rob Refsnyder who are young guys everybody likes but theres no where for them to play right now. Refsnyder is surprisingly Korean. Ronald Torreyes is another young backup infielder. Not Korean. Austin Romine is the backup catcher. We will likely sign an old guy and trade Romine to the Pirates where he will hit .. Our best starting pitcher is Masahiro Tanaka whose elbow is held together with scotch tape. Michael Pineda will throw four perfect innings then give up five runs in the th. C.C. Sabathia will give up five runs in the st then pitch well for the next five innings. So thats always fun. The rest of the rotation is lets say unsettled. Luis Severino was a top prospect who got hit hard last year. Adam Warren has historically been a lot better as a reliever than as a starter. Bryan Mitchell Chad Green and Luis Cessa are other young options. We are all eagerly awaiting the arrival of a prospect named James Kaprielian just so someone can get a lot of upvotes with a Release the Kaprielian! meme. The bullpen is pretty exciting with Aroldis Chapman coming back. He throws  MPH and everyone gets pumped up when he comes into the game. We had him last year and traded him for Gleyber Torres who is now our top prospect. Then we signed Chapman as a free agent. Cahgod. Dellin Betances is the setup guy and hes also very good. Hes  and he wears . Tyler Clippard was a Yankee prospect and we all liked him because his nickname was the Yankee Clippard but then we lost him. Its nice to have him back for the nickname.

10798023,0,t1_ddtom6e,Yeah catchers tend to have more homework to do in regards to studying opponents and their own pitchers and a lot of times that translates into being a good manager. But that doesnt mean that noncatchers wouldnt have an incredibly deep understanding of the game and I think ARod is a fine example of that.People have mixed opinions on Girardi as a manager but he was one of the best defensive catchers when he played. He knew every batters ins and outs and worked well with most pitchers but there is no denying that hes had some struggles as a manager. Just because you were a good catcher it does not guarantee a thing about your managing career.

Since the entire economy of baseball is dependent on huge broadcast deals thats a nonstarter. Regular consistent breaks are not terrible things in terms of enjoyment. Hockey has two huge breaks in the game and Ive never had an issue sitting through them. Same as commercial breaks in baseball. Oh look the hotdog is racing the lemonade! The second is you actually make pitchers pitch and batters bat.
