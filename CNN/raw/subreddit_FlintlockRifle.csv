5699221,0,t1_cx3ie5t,Nice! For a first carving you done good as we say in the southland. Yes they are expensive. On the other hand good tools last practically a lifetime. I totally screwed the pooch with my first carving tools I bought several from Track of the Wolf those listed on their site as good for gun carving... Bullshit they were all like s U shaped gouges and worthless for gun work. That is one reason I dont give them my money these days the other is ordering one item and them putting it in their back ordered slot and me waiting four months and never getting it. Id get these weekly sunny toned email notices that they were still thinking about me and would soon be sending along the tool. Ha about month five I gave up and spent my money elsewhere and have never ordered anything from them again. Plus a lot of the crap they offer is not only historically incorrect but marginal quality. End rant about TOW. There may be some of my early carving attempts buried in the shop somewhere but I havent ran across them for several years.How is the SMR coming along?  ,FlintlockRifle,cx3jkov,2,t5_3ad71
6576368,0,t1_czzgogr, Larry Zornes at his Mold and Gun Shop is another excellent lock maker lock problem solver he got an RL Davis lock sparking for me last year did a great job. I dont have my contact info for him any longer sorry. Frankly I believe you are being a bit timid about doing it yourself. It isnt that difficult if you go slow and take your time. You could have one tuned in an hour or two. You dont remove hardly any metal not even a thousands of an inch when tuning the lock so the geometry does not change. You are simply IDing as I described yesterday those spots that bear on one another and polishing them. Doing it yourself will be a good learning experience and once youve done one you can do any of them. Sounds like you have the makings of a fine shooter Douglas barrel Walter Cain trigger and a Siler lock. I have a siler style lock and set triggers by Mr. Cain that are awaiting a worthy gun. Some day Ill get around to building a rifle around them. Cheers do think of doing it yourself you would really have to go some to screw it up.,FlintlockRifle,czzjtny,1,t5_3ad71
