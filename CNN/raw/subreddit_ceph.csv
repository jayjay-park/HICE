10629997,0,t3_5s06d2,As others have suggested the ansible playbook is very goodI also just rediscovered this on this subredditWhich seems better for ongoing tuning and sitewide changes if youre used to using Salt. Although you can manage to do this with the ansible playbook provided you change your variables and rerun it. Usually takes about  minutes and that really depends on how many OSD nodes you have.Heres the article linked in this subreddit if you want to learn moreIt appears it also does the initial configuration for you or can take over an existing cluster. Personally I would get ansible setup with all the machines then do the simple stuff to bootstrap the nodes and install salt on them.Disclaimer I have not used Salt but have heard good things. I definitely have used the ansible playbook above to deploy a cluster and it went well. With the newest version be sure to set the community version to true if you get any errors during deployment. I tried it out recently in a vagrant environment and that was one thing that changed in newest versions.Also  mons is enough for hundreds of nodes. I would recommend going back and reading a bit more from the documentation.,ceph,ddcej2r,2,t5_2valu
