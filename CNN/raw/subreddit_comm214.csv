830295,0,t3_23b30t,I believe this article brings up a great point that we have discussed in class regarding the fact that the problem isnt the social networks themselves but how we use them. Most times someone will see something on Twitter and just read the  character tweet and not look beyond what that one person said. This can be an issue because they are then not getting all of the possible information. It is the readers responsibility to look further into the topic to receive as much information as possible. I agree with the author about the idea that social media does in fact bring us together. Being able to tweet about a current event or breaking news right when it happens for others around the world to see is part of the beauty of social media. For example I follow multiple news stations on Twitter and that is where I get my breaking news. Numerous times I have been informed about important news directly from Twitter and I really rely on social media to keep me updated on current events throughout the day when I cannot watch the news on TV or read articles online. Sharing an article on Facebook is yet another example of how social media can have a positive impact and help spread important news extremely quickly. ,comm214,cgynmzy,1,t5_2vzhr

2229110,0,t3_2kocmi,JJ Watt is mocking Mettenberger for taking selfies before the football game instead of focusing on the actual game itself. Narcissistic malaise comes back to bite Mettenberger in this case. JJ Watt is clearly mocking the concept of selfies in the millenial age.,comm214,cln68ie,1,t5_2vzhr
2366778,0,t3_2m83jk,Great article. I enjoyed this article because I read both ebooks as well as purchase books from local bookstores. Blue Bicycle Books is my favorite in Charleston and they are a great example of a thriving local bookstore they recently hosted a young adult book festival. I believe this article analyzes well the relationship between digital and paperback books in our current culture,comm214,cm48r0k,1,t5_2vzhr
2402787,0,t3_2mtb5h,This article illustrates just how much power the government has over its people. It shows how they see groups as a single body and do what they can to manipulate it to their control. By seizing the cell service they would get the group to disband. However as the previous commenter states this is also a major violation of freedom of speech. It poses the question should human rights by challenged by government protection.,comm214,cm8oyrq,1,t5_2vzhr
2466840,0,t3_2ktoz8,This article deems the Internet and more specifically the World Wide Web the god of creation god of destruction. The Washington Post is summing up the top  changes or shifts the Internet has made in our lives. One that really stood out to me was the selfdiagnosis that often occurs. I know that I myself am guilty of feeling sick or having something that seems out of the ordinary and running to the Internet to look up my symptoms and jump to the worst conclusion. I found it striking however that this article confesses that doctors do the same thing  of the time. Another interesting point that this article brings up is the idea of humans now because of the Internet being more apt at multitasking. We read a piece earlier in the semester that suggested the Internet makes our attention spans more fragmented because it is not natural for our minds to focus on more than one thing at once. I think that multitasking in this article means compiling all the information in once place making it available at our fingertips rather than having to spend hours reading through encyclopedias and anthologies to compile information. In this sense yes we are better at multitasking. ,comm214,cmglnv5,1,t5_2vzhr
3228919,0,t3_2wtszm,I agree but I think it can also be seen as a satirical look at the situation or even a reminder that we have not always had these technologies. I imagine for children born after  this will become even more difficult to understand because they have grown up with all of these more advanced technologies. At least for many of us we remember not having a cell phone or how annoying it was having to use dial up or when IMing on AOL or Yahoo! was the fastest way to chat with your friends. ,comm214,cowokpa,1,t5_2vzhr

3470872,0,t3_2zvnw7,Haha. Hey shes the Louie CK of ! And the talk about changes in the phone fits SO well with the domestication angle. Im sure if you look you can find Bob Hope or somebody in the s being nostalgic about what they had before home phones with spinnie chords.Oh and bonus nodd to Nick Carr and how Ellen cant remember things anymore because of the technology in .,comm214,cpnwke5,1,t5_2vzhr

5659769,0,t3_3sm62r,Honestly what is wrong with a little self promotion? I personally run a tumblr account and linking it to my Instagram has helped me broaden my reach of followers. It may seem shallow and a little selfinvolved but at the end of the day Im doing it to advance myself and make myself happy even if it means playing into my own ego.,comm214,cwyndfi,1,t5_2vzhr
5730459,0,t3_3t9aj5,After reading this article I thought it was quite sad because the author of this article stated that if she didnt edit her Instagrams and portrayed the real trueness of her images then she would loose followers. Its sad to me how this world has to edit to enhance their photos like nothing is ever good enough. I also found this article inspiring because I admit I am concerned with filters and not thinking just my plain old photo is acceptable to post on Instagram. This article gave me a chance to realize that editing gets out of hand and its easy to get caught up in the Instagram world thinking that you need to put a filter on every image to portray something you think looks better to your followers. In reality its not and we all should realize that it your photos dont always need to be constantly edited. ,comm214,cx7f3vz,1,t5_2vzhr
6801761,0,t3_48u6fg,I find this article particularly interesting because while I dont think social media is as addictive as drugs or alcohol I definitely see myself checking my phone constantly even if I just checked it  minutes ago. I think most people this generation have this problem of not being constantly entertained so they turn to their technology and social media. Interesting article!,comm214,d0n9tl4,1,t5_2vzhr
7230849,0,t3_4ecvdv,This article was really interesting to me and I didnt realize rappers had actually been accused of murders based on their lyrics. I dont totally agree with this and in this case lean towards the side of artistic expression because a lot of rap songs are filled with complex metaphors and lyrics that mean something completely contrast to what theyre saying. ,comm214,d203ec4,1,t5_2vzhr
