In Gods eyes the most honoured of you are the ones most mindful of Him God is all knowing all aware.gtgt Quran   The Quran further commandsgt God does not forbid you to deal kindly and justly with  anyone who has not fought you for your faith or driven you out of your homes God loves the just.gtgt But God forbids you to take as allies those who have fought against you for your faith driven you out of your homes and helped others to drive you out any of you who take them as allies will truly be wrongdoers. gtgt Quran  The arabic word used in this verse birr dutiful respect and compassion is the same word that the Quran commands Muslims to use in the treatment of their own parents Quran .And the Quran even states that one should be good to ones parents even if they strive to make him abandon Islamgt If they your parents strive to make you associate with Me anything about which you have no knowledge then do not obey them.

How uncomfortable a couch to recline on!           gtgtQuran gt And if your Lord had pleased surely all those who are in the earth would have believed all of them will you then force men till they become believers?         gtgtQuran gt So Prophet warn them your only task is to give warning gt you are not there to control them.       gtgt Quran gtHe said My people think if I did have a clear sign from my Lord and He had given me grace of His own though it was hidden from you could we force you to accept it against your will?       gtgt Quran gtas well as many many other verses which Ill post in a dedicated writeup on rislam Ill message you after I finish it ...translations from Abdel Haleem amp Yusuf AliFurther reading Islam and nonMuslims,badislam,d4w8320,2,t5_38c6a
