Edit I was listening to the video while doing something else so I missed the giant SARCASM on the screen. Whoops.B. Interesting theory but I prefer this one I read a while back. In a nutshell Mad Max is the Robin Hood of the Australian outback in that hes a mythical legendary figure. The films are legends passed down from generation to generation about this character. Maybe some are true maybe some are embellished maybe some are entirely made up. In any event this explains why hes always young and always has the same car theyre elements associated with him so theyre always part of the legend.,Haustinson,d2g4ybx,5,t5_3ec06
