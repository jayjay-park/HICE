9358,0,t1_cefhe0i,Thanks for the insight! It is worthwhile to note that MegaSaur doesnt actually have a weakness to fire  due to running Venusaur as a mega I should probably update my summary to reflect this whoops MegaSaurs ability changes to thick fat. This means Heatran is only going to be hitting with neutral damage for fire type moves. However due to Venusaur relying heavily on grass type giga drain and toxic leech seed is really the only thing doing damage so again not a very effective strategy when I only have so many synthesises to use and stall out with.As far as a Special Attacker goes perhaps a life orbd Alakazam? Hes got pretty great speed and magic guard protects from life orb and entry hazard damage and access to Focus blast. Hed do well as a revenge killer though is pretty frail to switch in to very much which might be problematic. ,stunfisk,cefi1ks,1,t5_2sn6d
9365,0,t1_cefhx16,If you have a problem with prediction just start talking to your opponent in the chat! Only works on simulators of course Or look up their ranking. Players with higher ranking are more likely to switch out if you can counter them because they know Chesnaughts set. Unexperienced players with lower rankings will more likely not switch out or make the VERY obvious switch. There was a smogon article about this lets see if I can find it... Edit Nope sorry Also you can try Heatran as a ToxicSpreader or burn. It has great synergy with Chesnaught.,stunfisk,cefi2lm,2,t5_2sn6d

40302,0,t3_1ukidp,You only have  pokemon? You should have  to give some variety.  You want to have moves that hit both the opponents pokemon like Heat Wave Rock Slide Blizzard and Muddy Water.  In addition Stall is a terrible playstyle due to doubletargeting and Rapid Spin is not as good a move due to Stealth Rocks and especially Spikes taking a valuable turn or three to set up that could have been spent actually KOing the opponents and switching doesnt happen as often negating the point of hazards.  Sticky Web often isnt worth using a pokemon on as half the opponents team likely wont be affected sorry Galvantula.  Volcarona is pretty much the only good setup sweeper since its the only one with a decently strong and accurate STAB move the targets both foes but not your team member in addition to having one of the best setup moves anyways.Most strategies are based off moves that the teammate is immune tobenefits from or messing with speed tiers.  Examples ThunderousTherianJolteon both spamming Discharge.  Zapdos spamming Discharge Heat Wave for backup LandorusTherian spamming Earthquake Rock Slide for Backup.  AbomasnowKyurem both spamming Blizzard for  turns.  Politoed spamming Surf Gastrodon spamming Muddy Water.  Trick RoomTailwind.

With jolly you speed tie other base s like the muskedeers and without it you get outpaced by jolly s darmanitan and kyuremblack and modest s raikou and jolly s mienshao zoroark. You wanna outpace all those things because a lot of them you can revenge kill like zoroark kyub and weakened darmanitan and raikou.Dont go overboard on iron fist. Mach Punch is good for priority. Thunderpunch is good coverage on gyarados and some bulky waters who might give you trouble but it isnt that great as a coverage move. Close combat is a must. Dont even think about fire punch. Go with flare blitz for a full physical set or with overheat so you can kill physical walls like skarm and others.,stunfisk,celuohd,7,t5_2sn6d

133603,0,t3_1vkqfu,Scarfed chandelure. I know but its a trick room team! Hear me out. This worked amazingly in vgc so thats what Im going to talk about. Simply for the fact that most trick room teams are easily discernible in the team preview a scarfed Chandy is gonna throw most people off. Packing overheat and shadow ball is really all this guy needs. I gave him  speed EVs IIRC. Thats just enough to out speed gengar who can be OHKOd with shadow ball if uninvested. And overheat hits pretty much everything like a ton of bricks. And since youre likely putting up TR on your first turn the SAtk drop wont mean much since youd likely switch out on the next turn anyway. This guy was definitely the star of my trick room team almost always dropping an opponent in the first turn. Always nice to start with a  advantage.,stunfisk,cetnay1,3,t5_2sn6d

160508,0,t3_1vwpuk,The best advice I can give you is practice. The doubles meta is so drastically different more mind games and prediction than singles. See that scary garchomp you wanna kill? Just aim both attacks at him and pray? Oh no he used protect because he saw your ice beam coming from a mile away now rotom is hydro pumping you and you just wasted a turn. Momentum shifts now all of a sudden you react defensively but oh wait the opponent read that too and used the free turn to swords dance and switch rotom out for a Mawile intimidate lowered both your pokemon s attacks. Pretty much any loss is usually down to making mistakes or misreading your opponent. Try to make a team with some of your favorite pokemon from singles heavy on the power and not so heavily focused on defenses because doubles is faster paced stall is nearly nonexistent. When you can take  hits in  turn its better to hit hard a d hit first. Look for pokemon with fake out protect sleep moves spread moves or priority moves. Pick pokemon that can cover each others common weaknesses example rotom is only weak to grass hits which talon flame double resists. Talon flame commonly has water or electric attacks aimed at it so rotom can be switched in to tank those. youll only learn what works and what doesnt by getting smacked down by tight synergies and good prediction and when you learn some strategies youll begun to change your team. Also learn to take advantage of the entire  seconds to choose each move carefully. Nothing worse than quickly choosing a move only realizing while your opponent chooses that you know an even better move for that turn and watching your pokemon fall to superior level headed prediction. If garchomp used protect last turn that means he probably wont use it this turn so plan a move to either hit him or what you think will switch in for him. Then you start trying to predict two three moves ahead and the game feels like a form of chess. Good luck! ,stunfisk,cewpqxf,2,t5_2sn6d

625142,0,t3_21agjw,Do you want to actually be competitive or do you just want to play?This isnt going to be a popular opinion around here but if you want to be competitive you are playing to win. This means using Pokemon teams and strategies that will win you the game not things that you think are cool fun or fair. If youre not playing to win youre not competitive.Ive mentored plenty of players and I think one of the best indicators of whether they succeed or fail as a competitive player is if they hold onto any kind of emotional reasoning when making decisions whether that be in team building or actually playing. Those guys that stubbornly want to play with their favourites and use unique strategies? They dont end up doing well. The ones that embrace the top tier Pokemon and strategies end up actually getting good.Playing with more common which also usually equates to better Pokemon means you can learn their strengths and weaknesses more efficiently than if trying to learn them only when you are faced against them. If you insist on using something like a Dedenne youll succeed in learning what its good against what its weak against and all things in between. How does this improve you as a competitive player? It doesnt really. Most competitive players already know that Dedenne gets destroyed by Pokemon thats actually good.,stunfisk,cgbbvev,7,t5_2sn6d

You miss out on the Water Absorb but boy does she accomplish exactly what you want. The set I run was made by uChansay and is flippin greatgt Alomomola  Leftoversgt Ability Regeneratorgt EVs  HP  Def   Sdefgt Bold Naturegt  Wishgt  Protectgt  Toxicgt  ScaldIts a pretty similar set if not the same set that I see for Wishpassing Vaporeon the difference being more HP and Def to work with at the cost of SpAtk and SpDef. But her ability gives slightly different utility which also works great for your absorb core idea! You use her like any wish passer spreading dual statuses around while soaking up all sorts of physical hits and switching out as soon as you get a whiff of any special Electric or Grass type move. The great thing is on every switch you regenerate HP for the next round of Wishpassing no prediction involved!!Another partner for her since she loves being partnered with specially bulky pokemon like your Lanturn is Goodra.

804997,0,t1_cgvrlwq,For krook I spam EQ and knock off. Aqua tail is legitimately a filler move at best. Never clicked it or stone edge once.Defensive arcanine is fantastic. Given I have hazard control and the infrequency of rock types in the tier it is literally one of the best pokemon I have ever used. Not changing it. It isnt HKO by a Krookodile takes less than fifty percent from any darmanitan move after intimidate and makes a great check to honchkrow negating sucker punch and willoswisping before a BB. Most eqs or stone edges are unstable and without rocks I can usually live two unless its a rogue choice band. Defensive arcanine is only arcanine this gen with entei farm and victini Rhyperior also lacks recovery and intimidate. Rhyperior can also be burned by enteis sacred fire crippling it. For me these are huge factors in this team. Not changing sorry.Mew is actually working well. That is the standard set but I believe in a one knock off user per team philosophy and krook is mine. So thats one move gone. Willo wisp support already comes from arcanine and I havent found too much need for taunt. So I disagree with changing mew as what you are proposing is covered by much of my existing team mates.Lastly starmie has been underwhelming overall for in UU this gen. It is crippled by mss and it shows. It often tries to be both bulky and offensive rather than the nice middle that I like. I have used starmie quite a bit and while it fits on some teams I dont feel like it fits on mine especially as your set doesnt help against any of the issues I outlined. Cant come in on electric typed megas cant switch in on a dark pulse from megastoise and is walled hard core by florges as well as likely being crippled by mienshao.While I appreciate the advice I dont see it working too well synergetically with my team.,stunfisk,cgvs5lf,2,t5_2sn6d

1392087,0,t3_2a1rw6,Well your formatting is a little crappy but your team looks solid so far. My suggestions With Nidoking you should go for BoltBeam coverage. Flamethrower is decent coverage but not the best. Thunderbolt and Ice beam will provide you with at least neutral coverage on everything. If you want flamethrower badly switch Sludge Wave out for it.If Jellicent is specially defensive why run willowisp? That is more of a move you would add to defensive tanks to help power down major physical threats. Toxic is a good option because it gets the job of stalling out special and physical threats much faster. On top of that you already run Scald which has the chance to burn anyway. EDIT I forgot that the whole point of this thread was looking for other members! A well balanced team has two walls physical and special two sweepers physical and special and two setup pokes which can be walls fieldsetters setup sweepers etc. You already have your physical and special sweepers and a special wall. My physical wall in UU is Cloyster who can double as a rapid spinner. Because you already have a water type another good physical wall and a potential mega would be Aggron who can also be powerful with setup. I always run Sableye on my teams because of its ability to shut down fieldsetters and setup pokes with priority taunt. I consider sableye a sort of setup pokemon because once it gets into a rhythm with willowisp taunt and recover it can score KOs on its own. Lastly I suggest a fairy type for coverage and as a switchout for your Haxorous. Slurpuff is a potentially amazing setup pokemon and IMO can be stronger than Azumarill another physical fairy type. Typically Slurpuff is run with the Unburden ability a sitrus berry and moves Belly Drum and Play Rough.,stunfisk,ciqs24m,2,t5_2sn6d

1495941,0,t3_2bb4ds,If youre looking to survive a specific attack run a damage calculation and allot as many EVs as you need to do so.Generally HP EVs are more effective because it slightly boosts your ability to survive an attack on either side of the spectrum while investing in a Defense will give you a greater boost to survivability at the expense of only covering one side of the spectrum.

Most of your team is fairly frail so Id recommend something more defensive like Heatran.JolteonUse uKeezss moveset with the Choice Specs or Life Orb to ease prediction. Thats your best bet.Consider pairing Jolteon with a bulky Pokemon with Uturn for a strong VoltTurn core.

1546996,0,t3_2by33w,I was voting for this thing for like  weeks. My time to shine.Mega HypnoHP  gt  Atk  gt  Def  gt  SpA  gt  SpD  gt  Spe  gt  Ability ForewarnInner FocusInsomnia gt Dream AbsorbTyping Psychic gt PsychicDarkNew moves Dark Void RecoverYou know for a Pokmon whose whole shtick is putting stuff to sleep it sucks at that job terribly. While Dark Void suffers from the Stone Edge Miss syndrome it makes perfect sense considering the type change and the nature of Hypno. Anyway as for the new ability it provides . HP recovery for every sleeping Pokmon on the field. As for Recover I gave it to Hypno because it makes sense. Seriously it can somehow use SUNNY DAY AND IT DOESNT HAVE ACCESS TO BLOODY RECOVER! HOW THE HELL DOES BLOODY QUAGSIRE GET THIS MOVE AND HYPNO DOESNT?! GAMEFREAK SRSLY! breathes And yes I realize that Hypno doesnt have a STAB Dark move other than Foul Play. I considered swapping Recover out for Dark Pulse but yeah.Anyway the regular Hypno should rise in tiers just by the virtue of gaining those two moves. A curious thing about the speed of Hypno is that it allows the scarfed variety with to just barely outspeed base s with full investment. In other words one could use it with Dark Void and Trick for some amusing shenanigans.As for the Mega? Well Recover allows for a dedicated tanking set likeHypno  HypniteAbility Forewarn  InsomniaEVs  SpD   HP   SpdBold  Gentle Nature Dark Void Recover Toxic  Thunder Wave Foul Play  Psychic PsyshockThe EV values can be adjusted more towards balanced defenses. Anyway pretty standard tank as it goes except it also gets Dark Void to detter those that would want to set up on it. It can also carry some passive damage or use its SpA to hit with a STAB Psychic move or both.Hypno  HypniteAbility Forewarn  InsomniaEVs  SpA   SpD   SpdTimid  Calm Nature Nasty Plot Psychic  Psyshock Shadow Ball  Dark Void  Signal Beam Recover  Signal Beam  Shadow Ball speed is not too shabby. That combined with the considerable bulk of Mega Hypno and Dark Void AND access to the ever so elusive Nasty Plot allows it to pull off some nice set up sweeping. You can sacrifice Dark Void for more coverage although it makes the whole set more risky. You can also use Recover for well recovery. A Baton Pass set is also a possibility.One last thing. This thing would probably be really good in doubles. Unfortunately I dont play a lot of them so no idea for viable sets.,stunfisk,cja6u25,1,t5_2sn6d

Theyre both rather suicideish though which might not fit your team as it is now. Youd also lose a lot of bulk on your team too.Im pretty partial to SD Cobalion especially now with the increased usefulness of Justified. It would give you a sturdy steel type as well. Another teammate that would go well with both Kabutops and Cobalion would be Yanmega. Tinted Lens with specs is devastating but so is Life OrbSpeed Boost. The big bug has Giga Drain for your bulky waters as well. Kabutops can handle rocks and lure in grass type attacks and Cobalion can take on some steels that wall either and rock moves aimed at Yanmega.

The largest factor I would say is deciding what format you wish to start in.  The two largest are VGC which is the official format and is based around Double battles and Smogon OU which uses the ever present tier lists and is in Singles.Movesets and synergy are everywhere but you could go ahead and try to build your first team to learn easily!  Here are a few linksOur very own Guides section located at the top bar has some good info on most topics for an introduction.This dictionary can help you term wise especially the roles section.  Pokemon are not just physical or special they are so much more.  No two physical attackers are alike.  All in all just read guides and watch videos.  It comes naturally.  Whenever you want you can go give Showdown a spin and then maybe even start breeding in game for a WiFi Battlespot team!  Ill be here if you have any more questions general or specific!

1732616,0,t1_cjxk64n,Heres more I wrote because it went over the  characetr limitNow for some things about YOUR team specificallyGarchomp you will get MUCH more out of Garchomp with this buildGarchomp  Expert BeltLife OrbOffensive item of choiceRocky HelmetAbility Rough SkinEVs  Atk   Spe   HPJollyAdamant Nature Jolly preferred Swords DancePoison JabIron Head Earthquake Stone EdgeRock Slide Dragon ClawOutrageEdgeQuake combo is resisted by few and those that do dont resist Dragon Claw. Swords Dance will help your sweep but for coverage youll want Poison Jab or Iron Head for Fairies. Earthquake MUCH gt Dig. Iron Head MUCH gt Iron Tail. Dragon Rush is good but the super low accuracy will obliterate you when it counts most. Use the more reliable Dragon Claw or Outrage if youve taken out all the SteelsFairies your opponent has. Rough Skin accrues damage for hits on Gar. Jolly will let you outpace more pokemon than Adamant as Gars speed tier is hotly contested.Crobat Change the nature to Jolly. Crobats speed tier like Garchomps needs the extra oomph. If you arent using Infiltrator as your ability youre wasting a good deal of potential with Crobat. Infiltrator will stop your opponent from stopping your sweep with a Substitute. There isnt much that would like to be hit behind a sub by STAB Brave Bird. Get rid of Acrobatics for it. Replace Return with UTurn for more momentum and coverage. This means you can replace XScissor with something like Roost longevityget rid Flying type or Sleep Talk sleep absorber or Super Fang cut annoying walls down to size Bite can give you coverage but so can Pursuit and it has more utility. Steel Wing is some coverage for Fairies but it isnt used often. Zen Headbutt isnt a terrible choice. You could also use one of Crobats immensely useful support moves like Taunt or Defog or Hypnosis or Tailwind. For an item use Black Sludge as it will allow you to recover HP like a Leftovers user with your Poison type but deters your opponent from trying to Trick it off you.Gardevoir Change the nature to Timid Gardevoir wants to move first always. Switch Psychic out for Psyshock. This will let you hit Special walls that would otherwise completely wall you like Blissey. Consider losing Shadow Ball for some more coverage like Thunderbolt and leaving the Ghost coverage to a Pursuit trapper who can just about always ensure a clean unavoidable kill on GhostPsychic types rather than hoping your Shadow Ball KOs. Moonblast over Dazzling Gleam is a good choice but Hyper Voice gets the Pixilate bonus and typing and hits harder than both. Consider Trace as an alternative to Synch unless you want to use Gardevoir to absorb and transmit status on one pokemon.,stunfisk,cjxk75g,1,t5_2sn6d

Focus Blast and Flamethrower for Steel types and Grass types respectively and Hidden Power Ice because you can never have too much Ice type coverage.

2375198,0,t1_cm58dop,After typing all of this up I found this article that covers what I talked about and then some. Probably more concise and well written too. Welp I already typed it all out so hope it helps!Substitute definitely has some nuance to its usage and im by no means a great battler but substitute is really only used  ways. Sub on an offensive Pokemon to avoid statusWhen a pokemon is behind a substitue it cannot be afflicted by any status. That means no worrying about Thunder Wave or WilloWisp or Spore. Keeping your attackers burn and paralysis free is super important as a well timed Thunder Wave can end your chances of winning if its on a frail attacker like Gengar or MMedicham. Using it requires a little prediction and knowledge of your opponents play style. Lets say you bring in a Medicham on a Blissy. You know your opponent will switch out but you dont know to what and he has a Gengar in in his pocket so High Jump Kick is a big risk. Youre options are A Use HJK hoping he either doesnt switch or doesnt switch to Gengar and get big damage off B Use Zen Headbutt predicting a Gengar switch to OHKO even though it wont do as much damage to all his other pokemon or C use substitute to take some pressure off youre prediction.In this situation the correct answer is  C. If Blissy stays in and manages to break your sub you kill it next turn and it only cost you  of your health. If he switches to Gengar which outspeeds Medicham he wont be able to status you and will get OHKO on the next turn if he tries to break the sub and youve killed another Pokemonmon at with only  of your health gone. Any other switch means you get a free attack off while the opposing Pokemon breaks your sub and can switch or continue to attack at your leisure.TLDR The moral of the story is that on an offensive pokemon Substitute eases the burden of your prediction almost always putting you in an advantageous situation no matter your opponents move at the cost of  of your HP. Sub on a defensive pokemon to recoverstallUsing sub in this situation is a lot more straight forward than the on an offensive pokemon. When a Pokemon makes a sub the sub has the same defensive stats as the Pokemon that uses it. So on naturally bulky pokemon that have many common resistances it can be very hard to break a sub in one attack which is key to defeating this strategy. If you cant break a substitute in one attack you likely wont be able to take down that poke at all. If it has a recovery move like roost you will find it impossible to break the Sub gt Attack Move gt Recovery Move gt Sub pattern. This is what the Smogon Tropius set attempts to do. SubLeech Seed is a very popular combo on many grass types. The goal isnt to wipe at your opponent all at once but frustrate him as he attempts to break your sub while you whittle away slowly at his health. The hardest part is going to be creating a free turn for your tropius to either set up sub or use Leech Seed. Once you manage to set up leech seed AND get behind a sub youll find yourself nigh unkillable. The wont be able to get any status on you through the sub and between Leech Seed and Sitrus Berry Harvest bby! youll recover more health than they can deal with. Airslash is there so you dont get totally stopped by opposing grass types on which Leech Seed doesnt workTLDR Hiding behind a sub on a purely defensive pokemon is a way to increase the longevity of it and allow your pokemon more time to use its HP recovery. There are few things more demoralizing than seeing a pokemon at  HP and still behind a subsitute because you couldnt break it.  Sub on a setup sweeper to...well set up! In practice the usage of substitute in this situation will almost mirror one of first two situations depending on its usage. Similar to the offensive use of sub you need to predict a switch to get off a substitue than proceed to use your set up move to get the edge on whatever pokemon that comes in to break it. There is no better example of this currently than Mega Salamence which is currently destroying the ORAS metagame. Bring in MSalamence against something that will switch out use Dragon Dance to once to outspeed whatever tries to come in against it and proceed to kill everything. There are certain pokemon that become absolute MONSTERS after just once speed boost Charizard X and MSalamence are good examples and a sub can give them the one turn they need to set up. The other side of the setup sub is defensively Remember the stats of the sub are the same as the stats of the pokemon using it. So if you have a Suicune that has used Calm Mind twice and gets a substitue that subsitute will have  SpD making it hard for any special attacker to break.,stunfisk,cm5a740,3,t5_2sn6d

Signal Beam is better than Shadow Ball because it hits darktypes pretty hard on the switch and basically has all the same coverage you need.Second set without Psychic is utter garbage. Youre unable to do anything other than stall turns until you get crit.  Poison types and Steeltypes basically are free to do anything and it sucks you cant even touch Poisontypes with a Psychictype.

2622168,0,t1_cn0tng7,Oh on another note how does your team fare against Mega Venusaur? Every MGallade team I make has trouble against it. Unboosted Psycho Cut cant OHKO it and even boosted isnt guaranteed iirc. Neither does Overheat thanks to Thick Fat UGHHHHHHHHH I HATE THIS ABILITY I HATE IT SO MUCH ON THIS GUY. I find that the moment it turtles on the field it immediately gains the upper hand and switching in safely becomes difficult thanks to the occasional Sleep Powder. The whole battle becomes a somewhat onesided game of attrition for me and even when I win my team is battered and the opponent is laughing with their healthy pokes. The rest of the battle isnt always impossible to win but it does become a very difficult climb. The only way I can safely take it out is to Volt Switch early game and set up sweeping and hoping to bait it for a OHKO Psycho Cut and although I havent lost against another MVenu team so far with that strategy I feel that its unreliable.

You are talking about Volcarona but didnt include it in the rooster so I am assuming it doesnt fit my team. It looks fun though I think I will maybe train one on the side. gtYeah unfortunately ORAS Landorus only has Sand Force which means youre pretty much forced to run a Physical version in Therian Forme. Which isnt that bad honestly since thats the stronger and more popular set anyways. Despite the many Water types your friend runs Landorus still has lots of favorable matchups so well add him to your team lineup anyways.  This looks nice! But it is a postgame pokemon right? Soaring in the sky? gtTheres actually a lot of coverage options we can run on Greninja which is why he makes such a great filler on so many teams.  Huge fan of the Greninja setup.

I think this looks really good the only pokemon that is a bit too ugly for my standards is Rotom but I will survive xD You have done a really great job even a newbie like me can understand that!Can you talk about the Knock Off pick and maybe some alternatives? How should I use it?I should open with Ferrothorn and then place hazards etc. right?What is Aegislash role and how do I utiltize him fully?|| RotomWAnd here is the real tricker... I gain EVs by beating pokemons with the EVs I wantsupertraining but what about IVs?

2679817,0,t1_cn8cxjb,I think Clefable might be a little better than Gliscor in this instance  especially if youre concerned about keeping Conkeldurr honest. Your team is quite well positioned against opposing Steels between MegaZardY and Excadrill as well as having two Poisonimmune pokemon and overall looks like it compliments Clefable quite well. Clefable over Gliscor would also mean that you no longer have two pokemon with x weakness to Ice which is pretty big as a rule of thumb I try to avoid having any pokemon share a x weakness.That Gliscor can still be put to good use on another team so if you already have it built Id definitely recommend keeping it around. I have one ingame myself with the only difference being that I run Taunt over Toxic. The rest of the pokemon look like they need some slight tweaks Id probably drop Ice Beam from Vaporeon in favor of Heal Bell Dragon Pulse for Air Slash on MegaZard saw it suggested in the comments already and you have Garchomp for Dragon STABs and possibly swap one of the Dragon moves on Garchomp for another coverage move.

2769808,0,t3_2rr6bi,Swampert Umbreon Crobat and a banded Goodra? Im loving this team already! Heres my feedback Umbreon should probably run  HP   Def   SpD. There is no need to try to check LO Darmanitan when you have a Suicune and a Swampert banded Darmanitan is more common anyways. Your spread takes  from a Mega Beedrill UTurn on a max roll. It does stop Mega Swampert but Waterfall flinches are likely to get the best of you. Suicune looks nice and standard. The  speed EVs are to outrun max speed Adamant Machamp by the way. Support Crobat should run a bulkier spread.  HP   Atk   Spe Jolly is probably best but you can also run  HP   Atk   Spe if you want to outspeed Noivern. Black Sludge is the best item in my opinion. Id run Flare Blitz on Infernape because of the physical investment. Overheat is more for the wallbreaker sets. Swamperts EVs are to outspeed Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill in rain. Unfortunately Mega Swampert isnt the best sweeper outside of rain. You could run Rain Dance instead of Stealth Rock and use Swampert as a lategame cleaner I guess. Run Power Whip on Goodra instead of Superpower. Power Whip HKOs all the bulky waters allowing you to avoid the Suicune staredowns. For speed either run  speed EVs to outspeed Suicune and neutral base s or run  speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow plus a little extra speed creep perhaps. Speed Boost Yanmega looks like a threat. If you see a Yanmega be sure to keep Goodra healthy.My recommendation would be to use physically defensive Swampert with Leftovers instead of the mega. Since youve now consolidated the roles of stealth rocker and fire check you can swap out Suicune for a versatile attacker  win condition. Im not sure what to use though. Maybe Mega Aerodactyl or Calm Mind Jirachi. Or maybe even Mega Abomasnow or Swords Dance Cobalion.Another option which I already mentioned is to run Rain Dance on Mega Swampert and try to fit rocks elsewhere in the team. I guess you could replace Suicune with Rhyperior or something.,stunfisk,cnix0np,1,t5_2sn6d
2805823,0,t3_2s7k4h,It will be interesting to see how big of a role Smeargly will play in the upcoming VGC  since he didnt really do well in  from my experience.People are used to dealing with Kangaskhan for the most part and there is  a variety of options that can deal with Smeargle.. Magic Bounce  Espeon is a good example but now we also have Sableye who can bounce Dark Void and is immune to Fake Out! Thus potentially putting pokemon. If your partner has a Lum Berry or Protect you are now starring at a sleeping Khan Artist team.. Inner Focus  My primary strategy in VGC  with Lucario I could KO Khangaskhan while being immune to Fake Out. Dark Void was still a problem if the opponent got it off but with a Ghosttype partner that knows Taunt like Gengar you can stop Smeargle. Only problem if he is scarfed though there is always Sableye.. LumChesto Berry  Obvious point not everyone wants to waste a Lum Berry for that purpose though. I have started running specific berries like Cheri Berry to heal Paralysis on my Togekiss. So if you have a Chesto Berry on a pokemon you can specifically counter Dark VoidSpore.. Safeguard  In combination with PranksterQuick Guardetc you could actually protect your entire team from Dark Void for several turns which usually allows you to turn the game into your favor.. Protect  To avoid Fake OutDark Void you can Double Protect on Turn  given that you have at least  pokemon that is faster than Scarfed Smeargle or Priority to take it out. Protect also reveals the item of Smeargle because it is naturally slower than Kangaskhan Neutral Nature Kangaskhan has  Speed with full investment Positive Nature Smeargle has only  Speed with full investment and so its most likely that Smeargle wears a Sash if he is slower than Kangaskhan.. InsomniaVital Spirit  Abilities that counter sleep are also an option although one I havent used effectively yet because you usually want a better ability. There is also Sweet Veil which prevents all allies from falling asleep but only Slurpuff has this ability and you usually want to run Unburden on it making it the prime example of a generally more useful ability.. Taunt  Using Taunt is not always possible because of Fake Out but generally a solid idea. Sending out  pokemon with Taunt might also be an option one to stop Kangaskhan one for Smeargle and follow that up with whatever combo you want. Those are all the counter measures I can think of and usually in the VGC format you will find a few of them on your team if you have balanced it well. Quick Guard is also an option but like most of these it actually loses to Scarf Smeargle without the benefit of boost or priority.Double Protect followed by PranksterTaunt still seems like the best option. Send out your Mega  Thundurusother Prankster and make sure your Mega outspeeds and beats Kangaskhan on Turn . If anything you will be able to get some good damage in if Smeargle has to switch but as long as Kangaskhan gets KOd even a Magic Coat Smeargle shouldnt be enough to pull the game around.Perfect Scenario  Turn Double Protect Turn  KO Kangaskhan Taunt Smeargle maybe SmeargleKangaskhan switch but you will still get some damage done Turn If Smeargle used Magic Coat switch into Magic BounceChestoLum to get your taunted Prankster out and Protect with your other pokemon or attack if you know that your pokemon is faster and you want to prevent a setup i.e. Smeargle is sashd and you can outspeed and KO the second partner.If Smeargle was taunted keep attacking the game should now be in your favor and you should know which item Smeargle has so doubletarget it when it wears a Sash Turn If Smeargle used Magic Coat it is definitely sashd so use spread moves preferably because it doesnt have high defenses and so you still get damage in on its partner even if Smeargle uses ProtectIf Smeargle was taunted it is most likely Scarfed I would still recommend Spread Moves when available to deal damage to its partner as well.,stunfisk,cnn0h4h,6,t5_2sn6d

3238702,0,t3_2x7xk9,HO takes no skill. You just lay rocks and send out one sweeper atfer another.This is not true. Building Hyper Offense is not as easy as people make it out to be. You most certainly do not just take a suicide lead and add  sweepers. Well built HO teams would be sure to not be inherently weak to anything meaning you have to make sure to not be d by set up sweepers as you usually have no walls to tank a hit to phase or whatever. An example of this would be HO in Ubers you have to make sure everything on your team hits Geomancy Xerneas hard enough to put it in revenge killing range for your priority user usually Extremekiller Arceus in this case. Then there would be other factors such as how you handle other sweepers that always find a chance to set up  like Mega Salamence Ekiller himself and Primal Groudon. Usually you can at most allow them for one turn of set up so something bulky enough can revenge kill or something with a Choice Scarf. This also a case in OU Scarfchomp to revenge kill  Zard X is an example. Then there are other factors such as making sure the team has good offensive synergy. Are the members efficient in taking out each others threats? Are you unable to break past some stall cores? Then there is playing the playstyle which is arguably just as hard to play as stall or balance. Like you mentioned the style does not care for switching in to things thus you focus on keeping momentum throughout the game. So you have to read your opponent really well double switching etc. When facing stall for example you dont want to give your opponent a free turn of recovery as that rids all of your hard work and allows them to wear you down. So you always want offensive pressure forcing them to switch about racking up hazard damage and preventing recovery. Reading your opponent is not always easy often there are s which arent in your favour. Does he predict my prediction and stay in? Nah he probably wont idk. Oh he did! If you lose the  you are punished more since you are often the one lacking recovery. Its my favourite playstyle because I like quick games I cant play stall and spend like  minutes each game on the ladder for example as opposed to . Im not patient enough for that. Here is an example of a well built HO teamIt has a good lead with Sashed Infernape who sets up rocks and has Endeavor  Vacuum Wave shenanigans. Endeavor also enables it to act as a pseudowallbreaker. The core is focused around Mega Metagross and Keldeo who have already proven to be a very effective core. They have good defensive synergy thought not exactly needed on HO and more importantly are effective in taking out each others threats. Specs Keldeo for examples beats MMetas checks such as Mandibuzz Skarmory Mega Sableye and a few more while MMeta takes care of MVenusaur and numerous Fairies for Keldeo. Then there is Thundurus with Prankster ThunderWave to help with opposing set up sweepers essentially making it a check to all. Thundurus also beats extremely bulky set up sweepers such as Mega Slowbro. Choice Band Dragonite eases the match up against opposing HO and makes for a secondary revenge killer with its very strong Extremespeed notably beating Talonflames Brave Bird. It also is a nuke making it an effective wallbreaker. Simply spamming Outrage once fairies have been removed by Metagross or Bisharp breaks stall teams pretty easily. Bisharp rounds it off preventing or punishing things like Defog ensuring hazards are staying up. He also beats bulky Psychics for Keldeo to have a field day. So thanks to effective priority and overall good synergy of the team it has proven to be solid marked by its peaking of the ladder. ,stunfisk,coxp5ci,22,t5_2sn6d

3253145,0,t3_2x5n25,Giving up one of your three teamslots for a Pokemon thats mostly dead weight Ninjask just to set up Mega Lopunny isnt a great strategy. MegaLop hates Flame Body and Static and theres still plenty of Protect running around to ruin High Jump Kick. Ninjask is super frail too and will bait out Electric Fire AND Ice moves meaning it will frequently find itself paralyzed burned or frozen even if you run Sash so the odds of you successfully passing Hone Claws in most battles isnt too high.I managed to get to  with Mega Lopunny before losing to an insanely stupid misplay but I was VERY lucky to get to  in the first place. The set I ran was Adamant nature with Fake Out Substitute Low Kick and Return. Fake Out was awesome MegaLop REALLY struggles to get OHKOs without that chip damage. Substitute was amazing there were a LOT of times where I blocked a ToxicThunder WaveWillOWispLeech Seed to get a free Sub then HKOd or OHKOd whatever I was up against. Low Kick was the only option for a Fighting move since I needed to OHKO Tyrantrum Choice Band Head Smash Heatran Tyranitar after breaking Sash etc. Return is obvious.The problem is that MegaLop has a ton of weaknesses and its hard for its teammates to cover all of them. Bulky Volcarona is a huge one I had Unaware Quagsire to deal with it but I lost a battle because it fainted to an untimely Bug Buzz crit I usually Rest before Im at low enough health for crits to KO. Fear of Flame Body and Static means you need good switchins to Electric and Fire hence Quagsire and youll obviously want a Fighting switchin too. I ran Aegislash along with Quagsire but found myself dreading runins with Tangrowth of all things too bulky to HKO with Lop Earthquake for Aegislash Power Whip for Quagsire Lax Incense for annoyance. Anything with GrassGround coverage was mildly annoying though MegaLop could usually survive a hit and HKO.So yeah...MegaLop is probably my favorite Mega but its incredibly hard to use in the Maison. With a lack of reliable recovery defense boosting wont get you far. I needed to consult the lists of opposing Pokemon a LOT just to get to  though I was able to get to  relatively consistently once I got the hang of it with the best MLop team I could come up with its pretty much Hard Mode for the Maison. Good luck though!,stunfisk,coz75q4,1,t5_2sn6d

3279499,0,t1_cp20ulg,Why not just make a Smogon account then? Anyway I think you can still view their threads without an account unless Im missing something here. Learning how to build an effective core isnt too difficult once you get the basics. In short a core consists of two or three Pokemon that take care of each others threats really well while being able to support each other. They also have good synergy. Synergy is a broad term defensively it means good typing synergy. Offensively it means taking out each others threats well. Here is an example of an offensive core Mega Metagross and Keldeo typically SubCM. This is an offensive core and is very effective mainly because they handle each others counters really well. Mega Metagross beats Mega Venusaur Clefable Sylveon Mega Gardevoir and the Latis for Keldeo whereas Keldeo beats Scizor both regular and mega Mega Sableye Gliscor Skarmory Mandibuzz for Mega Metagross. Some other perks are that they share good synergy. Metagross resists Fairy Psychic Flying and Grass for Keldeo and Keldeo resists Fire and Dark for Metagross. To round out this core you look at some of their weaknesses. Immediately you can see bird spam notably Talonflame as a big threat as well as Slowbro. RotomW can handle both or if you want to go more offensive you can choose Thundurus or Raikou. So looking at it the reason this core is effective is because they take each others threats out really well and have added advantages of good typing synergy. Raikou RotomW or Thundurus also round out the weaknesses for Keldeo and Metagross. A defensive core needs good typing synergy as that is essential for Pokemon out there to stall. You want to be switching out often so its essential that you have good switching potential. Furthermore it is appreciated to have one member as a physical wall and the other as a special. A very solid example of this is SkarmBliss. Blissey  Chansey is weak to Fighting and hates physical moves. Skarmory has no problems taking Fighting type attacks as most are physical and Skarmory has insane physical defense. It also has Flying STAB to take out Fighting types. Meanwhile Skarmory hates special moves which Chansey  Blissey has no problem taking. However special type Fighting attackers can break through this core as Skarmory cannot take special moves and Chansey is weak to Fighting. The most notable Pokemon that possesses this is Mega Lucario or CM Focus Blast LandoI. Therefore you want something that can handle these to round out the core. TLDR  a key part to a good offensive core is being able to take out each others threats well. I would say the most important things for an offensive core to work are in order being able to beat each others counters finding a third mon to cover the weaknesses the previous two have having some switching potential due to good typing synergy that way you have insurance if youre in a bad situation. The priority list for a defensive core would be being able to switch in  counter each others threats good defensive typing synergy having a third mon to round out the weakness. Scizor can offer many things in a team he is not weak to Fighting btw. It has good defensive typing with its one weakness being Fire. It can support go offensive act as pivot switch and give a form of strong priority with Technician Bullet Punch. It also is a good counter to most Fairies as well as one of the few counters to Mega Metagross. You can make it a support set with Defog Roost Bullet Punch and UTurn  Knock Off. Mega Scizor is typically better suited for this role as it has more bulk and can switch in on so many things but regular isnt too bad either. You can make a hard hitting pivot switch with Choice Band. Choice Band Bullet Punch is a very strong form of priority UTurn dishes out big damage while gaining momentum. Note a slow UTurn is nice to bring frailer Pokemon in safely. The last two moves can be Superpower and Knock Off. ,stunfisk,cp23851,6,t5_2sn6d

3389402,0,t3_2z02y0,Hi there I gave your team a quick look and I have a few suggestions.. first off Id play around with switching items on venusaur and metagross. I like the idea of assault vest venu but it never seems to work well going mega gives you better ability and access to leech seed synthesis sleep powder and protect. Really non mega venu are only good on sun teams. I have used Mega metagross quite a fair bit and I tend to find it weak for a mega I switched back to an assualt vest and it works a lot better you can add ice thunder or bullet punch onto it. if you are having a problem with tailwind especially zapdos you cant go past thundurusit get prankster taunt and twave its got good bulk and can deal damage with t bolt and HP ice. I like sitris and life orb sets Id thought Id talk more about first point again. Mega metagross isnt bad its just that metagross is already good where as on your team venusaur is weak. With the rise of fairies youll rely on venu a lot and mega venu packs a lot more punch than regular and has a lot more bulk plus it gets thick fat which is a really good ability for it TLDR use assualt vest metagross mega venusaur and use thundurus for prankster taunt and t wave,stunfisk,cpema8s,2,t5_2sn6d

If it were used enough Magikarp could go to OU as tiers are based solely on usage.When something is too good for a tier but not used enough to be banned a suspect test process happens. If this Pokemon is deemed too powerful it goes up into the appropriate BorderLine tier or Ubers which is basically saying that it is too good for the tier below but not used enough for the tier above.Due to this a Pokemon can be used in  of OU teams and not be banned because OU is the top of tiers.,stunfisk,cq7kz93,1,t5_2sn6d

3748361,0,t3_33a3i2,Quag doesnt do too much against Aegislash by any means SubToxic completely destroys while it cant switch into the Crumbler set the most common. Heatran can very easily Toxic on the switch. Lopunnys only set that actually beats Aegi v is SubEncore while Altaria nearly always loses v to Aegi. Mega Swampert is only usable in rain teams while MPidgeot doesnt even HKO with Heat Wave and a Steel move does a ridiculous amount of damage to it. Quite a few will drop a lot in usageCelebi Jirachi MGarde while I completely disagree with Starmie dropping since Aegi loses to offensive SpinAnalytic Hydro Pump HKOs if Aegi switches in and it beats every other relevant spinnerdefogger except Mandibuzzwhich is gonna see a LOT more usage and Sand Rush ExcadrillScarf can still lose easily. I also dont think people should complain about LandoI which while admittedly gets better was already by a good margin the best Mon in the tier and shouldve been suspected before Aegislash IMO. Zard Y will see a rise in usage since it partners very well with Aegi while SpD Zard which is seeing a rise in usage also is a great check to Aegi itself. Bisharp was already a dominant force and will be even better and I kinda expect to see more Hydreigon because of the infamous HydraSlash core which covers all  types defensively on its own while having amazing offensive presense together.,stunfisk,cqjjdzk,3,t5_2sn6d

Another option you can try instead is a Forretress leftoversRelaxed  Max HP  Max Defense  Stealth Rocks  Rapid Spin  Volt Switch  Gyro Ball  This set is an allaround hazard support but leaves you open to fire type moves.  For Special Defense and fighting moves might I recommend Togekiss who has reliable recovery through roost and the common paraflinch set can cripple teams.  Togekiss leftovers  Calm  Max HP  Max Special Defense  Thunder Wave  Air Slash  Roost  Flamethower  First three moves are selfexplanatory Flamethower is for when your opponent wants to be cute and send in a steel type scizorferrothorn to play the parafllinch game. Flamethower is meant for a prediction or a already crippled enemy giving you a guaranteed hit. At this point you have a defensive core of ferrothornforetrress and togekiss who complements each others weaknesses as well as providing pivot through voltswitch.At this point I do not know what team you want to continue with wheter it be a bulky team to whittle your opponent down before revenge killing or a offensive team that is more geared at gaining early game wins and slow crippling. For the prior Rotom Mandibuzz Chansey and Conkeldurr will suit your team well even though there are some shared weaknessess.

Definitely get how it goes both ways cant have your cake and eat it too haha.Still Im wondering if the Lando user predicts wrong you can get an advantage like with the venu example...so if the Lando user has to predict right to get the upper hand isnt that an argument against banning since in order to get the KO it has to predict right? Im more referring to that aspect of prediction as opposed to you predicting around Lando...like if it carries rock slide for TornT if it doesnt predict right and hit on the switch TornT has the advantage right? Lando can nail stuff like that but it has to predict right and hit on the switch.Hopefully that makes sense. Also the word predict looks really weird to me now...,stunfisk,crcx03b,1,t5_2sn6d

4158030,0,t1_crtxi4y,Scarfed Gardevoir is better than specs but its kind of a niche set and Gardy has a lot to lose when it doesnt have its mega stone. Its lack of priority low defence and HP stat and okayish  base speed makes it pretty easy to take out. Its not like say Heatran which can take some hits thanks to its great resistances and defences or Tyranitar which has a ridiculous special defence stat under sandstorm weather and great bulk in general. Both of them are slower than Gardy but theyre definitely easier to use and are more useful in general.Mega Venusaur isnt as passive as you might be thinking. I know the defensive set is a bit passive but try using the offensive set. Also look at other threats that have similar or less speed and see if its worth trading off a tiny bit of bulk to outspeed them. Try partnering it with Heatran I know you hate it but youre really limiting your options if youre only gonna go with whats cute or cool. Honestly youre not gonna get a whole lot of good advice in this sub or ANYWHERE really with that kind of approach and build the rest of your team around them. They have ridiculous type synergy and I think itll be a good teambuilding exercise for you.Some things every team should try to include a counterstrong check to birdspam hazard setter WAY more important than youre giving it credit for hazard remover not especially important in some teams but its definitely needed in any team that uses Talonflame or any Pokemon that is weak to rock Fairy killer revenge killer especially one that can take out dragons like Zard X or Dragonite  even after a single Dragon Dance some ways to deal with Mega Venusaur Landorus both forms Life Orb Gengar Specs Keldeo Zard X Zard Y Mega Metagross and Mega Altaria All of these apply to Hyper Offence teams too and even a fair number of hyper offence players will include a decent spinner to save on what little bulk its frail teammates have. Maybe the last part seems a bit strange but it lets you cover a lot of ground and its important that you think about the meta when building your team. Also Zoroarks pretty bad imo. It can surprise people but it usually gives itself away. If you like Mega Metagross you could try using a MegaGrossKeldeo core. Its a bit overused I suppose but for a reason. Mega Metagross is terribly difficult to counter or properly check and Keldeo is either a very solid revenge killer with a scarf stupidly strong with specs or a great stallbreakerwincon with the SubCalm Mind set. I would suggest using either the Specs set or SubCM set with Mega Metagross.Im gonna say this again use a more standard team with more standard Pokemon that use more standard sets for now. For example take out Haze on Gengar for now because you might be subconsciously limiting your teambuilding options by convincing yourself that youve covered bases with it even though its only a sloppy bandaid to cover those problems at BEST. For now take out everything and try building your team around a Mega MetagrossKeldeo or Mega VenusaurHeatran core and keep in mind about the things I listed above. Think about some of the biggest threats in the meta and the biggest threats to each core. Theyre very solid cores that leave plenty of room for teambuilding so even if you hate using these Pokemon I think itll be good experience for you. ,stunfisk,cru869a,1,t5_2sn6d

Its essentially meant to keep your team in top shape healing off toxics and burns with heal bell and fully healing everything with wish your team should be bulky enough to survive coming in even at half health.Mega sableye for being the bulkiest magic bounce user in the game. Generally runs recover foul play knock off willo. Skarmory. Can set up hazards near essential for stall as opponents need to be punished for bringing in a wall breaker and get rid of ones that impede your switch ins. Mandibuzz also works for the defogging part.Clefairy or quagsire. Youre not gonna have a lot of offensive pressure so opponents setting up are going to be problems if you dont have an unaware mon. I could put more on here but these basically just cover the archetypes cleric status deterrent hazard setterremover unaware mon. The objective of stall is to make a team that walls the entire meta so use your own thoughts on it.

You will need a way to pressure and potentially lure fairies. Specs Flash Cannon Hydreigon or Life Orb Iron Tail Hydreigon might work well. You can also prevent Aromatisse and nonSynthesis Florges from healing by using Roar.Crobat also walls you. Using a Stealth Rocker that beats Crobat such as Mega Aerodactyl is a great idea allowing you to wear it down. You can even run Pursuit Aerodactyl to nail it as it switches out.Gligar and physically defensive Salamence also wall you. Fortunately this set turns Gligar into setup fodder unless it has Acrobatics but Salamence is a problem. These can both be lured pretty easily by slapping HP Ice on something like Infernape. Entei can also pressure Salamence if your opponent doesnt have a backup fire check.Other stuff that walls you such as Nidoqueen and Doublade can be worn down with repeated Knock Offs. Cresselia could still be annoying but its pretty passive. Opposing scarfers can also revenge you but if you have checks to common scarfers or some paralysis support you should be fine.Machamp looks like a decent partner since it has Heavy Slam and Ice Punch to nail most fighting counters but the shared weaknesses to flying psychic and fairy might be a deal breaker.,stunfisk,ct96wxi,1,t5_2sn6d

If you switch in on a weak physical attack with your crappy preMega stats you may get a nice  speed boost to threaten Heatran out with a HP Ground.  But the lowered speed doesnt do you any favors in general.  Fire types also hit quite hard.OverviewMega Vanilluxe is weird and mostly predictable with such a small movepool.  A possible Automatize set would probably be good too given its niche defensive typing and great offenses.  Its a shame it doesnt have any Fairy moves but oh well.

4910783,0,t1_cudi5k4,First I would swap the Life Orb off your Clefable for Safety Goggles or Lum Berry. That would allow you to Follow Me an oncoming Spore with no consequence. Clefables main job isnt to deal damage It wants to stay on the field as long as possible and Life Orb chips away at its health.For Latios you could run Life Orb Specs Scarf or AV. It really depends on what you decide to slap on Terrakion. If you run LO I find that you dont really need a Dragon type attack. Psychic and Dragon are both resisted by Steel and pretty much every Dragon used is double weak to Ice. So I find that foregoing a Dragon move is a good idea unless you want the neutral STAB damage that Draco provides. Something like HP GroundShadow Ball Protect Ice Beam PsychicPsyshock would be a good set. If you run a Choice item replace Protect with a Dragon type move. I dont think Choice Specs is necessary and I dont think Assault Vest would help you much. So I would go with either a Scarf or Life Orb. Terrakion likes Life Orb too so your best option would probably be Scarf.,stunfisk,cudjhnh,1,t5_2sn6d

If you are just playing to ladder then trust me boy the gimmicks dont stop. As someone that has worked into top  on various singles ladders with stupid things like batonchains and wobafett the gimmicks are there to stay. This is largely due to the chance based nature of gimmick teams that dont aim to achieve a high win rate but instead climb through sheer number of games at a  despite a lack of skill.

5409272,0,t3_3p49lc,I think the main problem with this team is that its fairly weak to Trick rooms biggest enemy Amoonguss. Your only way of OHKOing it is through heatran and even then heat wave is not a guaranteed OHKO depends on the setdamage roll Also you say youre not concerned about taunt at all but if youre gonna handicap yourself surely thats the worst way to handicap yourself as a trick room team? I think that Cresselia w protect and mental herb does everything you want to do with Misdreavus as well as being immune to taunt. It can also helping hand and with protect can just ignore fake out with a double protect first turn. I feel like Aron could be swapped for something more useful since most good players will know how to deal with it also now is not the best time for it with CHALK running around As for Gastrodon although you said you feel like choice items are better the ability for Gastrodon to swap between the coverage as it seems fit is a pretty key part of it and why expert belt is a good item for it.

5580915,0,t1_cwory2y,The thing is that manectric and rotom dont kill skarmory because skarmory just switches out to something like venusaur.  The electric types only hit skarmory when the opposing players normal switchins to them are weakened and theyre forced to use it.  A volt turn team capitalizes on two major things. chipping away at the opponents health with VSUTHazards . maintaining a good matchup at any given time and in turn forcing switches while hitting the switch in for more damageThe issue is more so that youre going all out on these aspects rather than looking at what it opens up.  Volt turn tears apart offensive teams very well because they typically lack recovery so by maintaining a good matchup you rack up a lot of permanent damage and eventually kill them.  Defensive teams are more problematic since volt switch and uturn dont really put out enough damage to secure kills and youll have to resort to stronger moves like earthquake or bullet punch or thunderbolt.  The risk here comes in that if they switch in a check onto one of these moves then that gives them a turn to heal set up hazards or return damage.  This causes a lot more  scenarios than one would expect e.g. defensive garchomp can sponge manectrics HPice so it may take the risk to disrupt your core.The plus side is that you still rack up a lot of chip damage.  A lot of their walls will hover around the  range which is especially good to turn some fast wallbreakers into sweepers ex. rock polish mega metagross mega lop SD talonflame. Excadrill actually fits into this role pretty well but unfortunately a good number of its checks hippo quag chomper all the flying bricks etc arent really handled by the rest of the team.  The control it gives over matchups also makes voltturn really good for trappers though those are harder to fit onto a team.I didnt suggest any mons to fix it because I cant really think of a simple solution I just kinda skimmed the team and thought about how id kill it. Scizor is by far the weakest part of the core though if you are specifically looking for something to replace CB scizor is hardly ever used these days tbh.  I dont really have a good answer with that to replace it with though. There are a few resources on smogon that can help though checks and coverage compendiums come to mind.Good luck,stunfisk,cwov4pv,2,t5_2sn6d

When the battle includes stuff like Zen Headbutt KyuremBlack Mega Latios and trying to setup Serperior on a Pokemon that OHKOs it it doesnt really mean that much and we cant actually see your sets and full movesets from it which makes it harder to judge.I can say that theres almost no reason not to run Mega Venusaur on monoGrass as its bulky as heck offers offensive presence and blanks some of Grasss major weaknesses in Fire and Ice.

5634781,0,t1_cwv0y05,Arcanine intimidates and outspeeds MGyarados HoopaU and TTars with a fast burn. Once that happens Arcanine easily defeats them by easily stalling them out. Same goes for Azumarill Bisharp Excadrill and ties with KyuB.  All you need to do is start with a WilloWisp. Most Garchomps lately are just stealthrockers which means Arcanine gets a free burn on them as well. Which seals their doom.Crobat is immune to toxic and can stay in a fight with roost while accumulating toxic damage on the opponent. He will not get hit and can easily switch in and out with his good typing while stalling.Maybe we disagree but Arcanine is doing absolutely fantastic in my OU team atm.

5780080,0,t3_3uarwl,I think the reason why many of these other than confusion get overlooked is because of the fact that only one move causes them whereas most other statuses have multiple ways of inflicting them. So Ill be looking into making these statuses more easily usable.CurseCurse is very devastating status since itll knock out the opponent very quickly and doesnt have to build up the damage over time. However with the restrictions it has it rarely sees use. So I suggest following changes The move Curse will seldom knock out the user. The user of the move will always be left at HP unless its at HP where the user will get knocked out by usng the move. New ability Haunt. If a with this pokmon gets knocked out the attacker has a  chance of being inflicted with the Cursed status. Given to Banette Dusknoir and Spiritomb families. Basically works like Aftermath but higher risk and reward. The pokmon I chose are all fairly ignored and I dont think this ability would break them due to the effect not being guaranteed. However the pokmon could see a lot more use in higher tiers thanks to this.TauntI admit that Taunt is already good as it is but I still feel like it needs some more ways of inflicting it to diversify its use and to give some pokmon more tools. New ability Aggressor. The pokmon has  chance to inflict Taunted status on opponents every time it attacks. Given to Fearow Basculin and Primeape families. This ability is extremely powerful due to its capability of shutting down many walls so I chose to restrict it only to some of the weaker pokmon and not give it to likes of Gyarados or Tyranitar. Feel free to suggest more low tier pokmon to give this ability. Electivire? Steelix? Ursaring?ConfusionI dont know how I would make confusion better balanced but Id like to diversify the effects of the status a bit more similar to how disobedience and Hyper Mode in Colosseum have various different effects. Maybe something like this  chance to recover from confusion.  chance to do the ordered move.  chance to do a move other than the one ordered.  chance to do nothing.  chance to hit itself in confusion.  chance to switch out as if the pokmon got roared.This would at least add some variation to the effects if not anything else. Overall the victim has a greater chance of not hurting itself but the status has a bigger chance of having smaller annoyances.TormentTorment has been declining in use and Heatran has been the only one to take advantage of the effect.  New move Tormenting Ray. Steel type.  BP special.  Acc.  chance to inflict Torment status. Learned by Klefki Heatran Magnezone Bastiodon and Probopass families. This is mostly a move that defensively oriented Steel type pokmon could use as their move of not being a Taunt bait. Heatran might be a bit too powerful with this move so maybe I shouldnt give this move to it? New move Torment Room. Summons a field effect for  turns where all pokmon are under the effect of Torment. This is mostly for Doubles and Triples and most likely a niche move like Wonder Room and Magic Room but the effect is interesting nonetheless and the name sounds a lot more terrifying than the move actually is so thats a plus. Probably mostly the same learnset as the other room moves have.,stunfisk,cxdkni7,16,t5_2sn6d

I will definately try out stone edge though.Something that I find with setting up manual sun is that water types get switched in hko with their stab and I hko back with FB. I dont feel like Vulpix does enough for the team even with Drought.Ill definately try Overheat Fletchling would you recommend a faster set for that? Im always changing up Brave Birds nephews set.Dwebbles leftover EVs cant change anything I always check.According to smogon Protect is to stop Fake Out users from breaking Abras Focus Sash which is why I run it. Also I have found that its pretty useful just to scout out what the opponent will do especially if I know its choiced. Helps a lot in the endgame.

Its moveset currently is Air slash Tailwind Follow me and Protect. However Dazzling gleam and Thunder wave seem very tempting to use as well but Im not sure what to switch it out for.Gyrados seems good but its lack of access to tailwind means its harder for me to beat opposing MegaRay and MegaMence with my own MegaRay.As for keeping Talonflame Im not so sure about it. It has the same typing as Hooh and Hooh also does what Talonflame can setting up Tailwind burning things and using Brave bird but bulkier.

6554976,0,t1_czsy9r2,Done. See here Random rambly thoughts The core itself can do some damage mostly through Mega Kang  Ive found Aegis to be significantly better as a check to Xern instead of the offensive set youre using but Ive kept your set if you wish to use it against Groudon and added Ferro for that purpose. Ive really tried not to manipulate your sets but Ill give my suggestions below. Essentially your core needed some beefy mons to balance it out as it is currently strong but frail but since youre running Aegis this is not gonna be anywhere near hyperoffense. A major problem immediately was probably stopping a Xern sweep once it gets on the road especially since Aegis is not gonna have any recovery to abate that issue a bit there are two Xern checks here in Aegis and Ferro although its mostly the latter Aegis is just to force Xern out which is why I called in Xern check . It still dies to HP Fire Xern but Xerns prefer to run HP Ground for PDon and Thunder for HoohKyogre so generally you shouldnt be caught out too many times. The elephant in the room was how to handle PDon. Having basically half the team already weak to him Ferro Aegis Greninja it made choosing the last two a bit restrictive. I couldnt choose PDon for fear of losing the speed tie and besides I already had my sweeper and my SR setter so there would be no point in stacking Ground weaknesses. ArcWater was the obvious choice in place of Latios and Latios is very frail and this team already has survivability issues the set Im running is weak to steels. As currently outside of Mega Kang I actually dont have a way to hit Groudon very hard Scarf LandoT came to mind as a makeshift counter. It has the benefit of dealing with a bunch of the strongest physical threats in the tier dealing particularly well with ArceusNormal and Groudon though it kills Hooh and does decently with Mence but also as it is scarved deals particularly well with some of the faster threats like Darkrai and Mega MewtwoY. Weaknesses of this team gets destroyed by Hooh ifonce LandoT is dead. Yeah nothing much you can do about that apart from making sure rocks are up but maybe change Explosion on Lando to SR if youre rly worried about the pressure. Xern with HP Fire as mentioned before. MEGA SALAMENCE outside of ArcWater which HAS TO STAY HEALTHY TO CHECK MENCE and Lando as an absolute emergency last resort check I dont really have a way to revenge kill Mence if it comes in and sets up on say Aegislash unless I use a screwy set like HP Ice Aegislash actually wait thats a legit option with Weakness Policy try it out. Things to try out Ice Beam over Shadow Sneak on AegisScarf on Greninja more physically defensive set on Lando and more specially defensive set on ArcW. Power WhipgtProtect on Ferrothorn to prevent him from being a monoattacker. Rocky HelmetgtLeftovers as a better check to Mence if things go terribly wrong. Try it out let me know what you think  hope you enjoy this team! Dont be afraid to give feedback on whats going wellnot so well and also as a final note just pls pls keep the nicknames. ,stunfisk,czxc67h,1,t5_2sn6d

As for Scizor hes a good allaround Pokemon and is very antimeta atm.If youre interested in the official format VGC the current special ladder is VGC  rules. Two restricted mons ones that usually arent allowed that arent mythical like the primals and Rayquaza are allowed on each team. Scizor has been paired up with Primal Kyogre quite a bit because PKyogres ability nullifies Firetype attacks leaving Scizor with no weaknesses.

6882645,0,t1_d0wgbmg,Of course you dont use the actual attack stats of your team to attack.  Thats ambipoms job.  Its just that Beat Ups power and number of hits is determined by the healthiness and base attack stats of each member of your party even after gen .  The base power of the move for each hit is equal to Base Attack of a teammate. This means that in a damage calculation damage would still be different depending on the base attack stats of each of your six team members but it would still use the actual attack stat of Ambipom in the calculation.For each hit the power would be calculated as so  .Ambipoms Attackx.Enemy DefensexBase Attack of one team member times any effectiveness multipliers and the .. damage variance.  Repeat five more times using a different team members base attack for the power calculationNot the attack calculation each time.The equations complicated but I hope you can decipher it with a bit of close reading.

6991295,0,t3_4bfiuw,Sounds like its my time to shine! How attached are you to the pokemon on this team? Because Nidoking and Omastar simply arent viable in gen . There are a few other questions from there whats your lead and most importantly whats the core strategy of your team? Its hard to suggest anything when I dont know what youre trying to accomplish especially when youve got two pokemon that I would consider distinctive JoltCuno. The reason I ask what your lead is is that if youre intending to use both Jolteon and Articuno there are two ways to go about it use Jolteon as your lead or use a very unusual team that demands an unusual strategy and isnt one Id tend to recommend.If you lead Jolt I strongly recommend dropping Thunder for Pin Missile as Exeggutor is a common sight in the early stages of a match.Articunos moveset could use some tweaking Bubblebeam does literally nothing its better off using Hyper Beam to nail Chansey and paralysed Alakazam. Fly is banned if youre playing on a sim but on carts its a good option because theres a glitch associated with Fly that you might get lucky and activate if you fp while in the sky from Fly you remain invulnerable until you switch or use Fly again... which happens to be the reason its normally banned.Tauros fills out the rest of its moveset with Blizzard and Body SlamTo replace OmaKing and fill out the remaining slot I suggest using the remainder of the big  Lax Chansey and Exeggutor. This gives you a sleep user a general purpose sponge and check to water types and a good solid wallbreaker.If youre restricted to the team thats already constructed for whatever reason Id probably run Chansey in the last slot as your team needs its walling capabilities and it also has access to Sing which is important because your team otherwise lacks sleep you definitely want sleep,stunfisk,d18t0o5,7,t5_2sn6d

7660735,0,t3_4k7wpc,OU Ok so I tend to run balanced teams that lean a bit more towards the defensive side. I would like to mix it up and have this team a bit more offensively oriented but still remain balanced. Ive tried hyper offense and it never turns out well for me. So I made a core of crawdaunt and gengar which has a decent amount of firepower but still has some defensive capability via gengars sub and willowisp. This core is great against stall and defensive oriented teams as crawdaunt can wallbreak and gengar can spam willo from behind a sub.Crawdaunt  life orb Ability Adaptability EVs  Atk  Def  Spe Adamant Nature  Swords Dance  Aqua Jet  Knock Off  CrabhammerPretty straight forward here. Standard set do as much damage as possible. Im questioning whether or not to use dragon dance instead of swords dance depending on the rest of the team build and if it needs more speed or not.Gengar  Black Sludge Ability Levitate EVs  HP  SpA  Spe Timid Nature  Substitute  WilloWisp  Shadow Ball  Sludge WaveYes I know Hex hits harder on willowisp gengar but I like shadow balls consistency. Anyway the way to use this gengar is a bit more variable than crawdaunts. Depending on the opponent it can play offensively or defensively behind a sub. However obviously its super frail and cant take much other than a few uturns.Overall I think this core is pretty solid. Some OU pokes that can dismantle this core with no trouble is keldeo and both mcharizards. This core seems to have the most trouble with bulky offense simply because theyre both so frail.

No your opponent didnt get lucky they outread and outpredicted you No you didnt lose because of hax you lost because you gave your opponent the opportunity to hax you out. I think when a player tries to take the blame away from themselves and project it onto anything else they lose opportunities to grow and learn.

7768864,0,t3_4lmx7u,Disclaimer Im not a huge UU player but Ill try. It looks like Mamoswine eats up this team with a little bit of hazards chip damage spread around. I would say replacing one of your dragons with a RotomHeat would be a solid response Im not totally sure what else you may do. Another point is that the sylveon set you are running does not stop LO Sheer Force Conkeldurr its best set imo which usually packs poison jab. That poison jab is doing .. and youre getting outsped. Potentially putting something like either a sky plate crobat or bulky crobat might be a good response. Thats not a great switch in as many have flying coverage but it can outspeed OHKO and also provides Defog on your team which Salamence will appreciate. Another option could be switching to a more bulky Salamence set if you wanted to keep sylveon bulky mence would do a lot of the physical attacker checking and Defog support that the team would appreciate and maybe change sylveon to a speedier pixie plate or calm mind set that could still pass some wishes.

7775629,0,t3_4lmx7u,Im going to be honest with you Goodra isnt the greatest pokemon in UU. It has less power and speed than the tiers premier dragon types. Choice Band is probably the best set but it doesnt offer much over Salamence besides Power Whip. Replacing Goodra with a different attacker will probably improve your team.Replace Sylveon with Florges. Florges is better for Calm Mind sets since it has instant recovery with Synthesis and room for Aromatherapy on the set. Run  speed EVs to outspeed max speed Adamant Conkeldurr.You seem to be very weak to Cobalion. Cobalion outspeeds everything and can sweep you if it gets a Swords Dance up. You could either try using a defensive Salamence set with fire coverage or adding another good Cobalion check like Slowking to your team.Entei is another problem mon for you team. A bulky water type or the previously mentioned defensive Salamence could help deal with it as well.If you could fit some fighting coverage on the team that would be great as well.

7787638,0,t3_4lzhc0,Heal Bell is not at all broken or overpowered and heres why.First very few pokemon use it in the first place. Not many pokemon can even learn Heal Bell or Aromatherapy and those that do often run other moves instead based on their role in the team. Assuming youre talking about singles since Heal Bell in doublesVGC is even less common the viable users areChanseyBlisseyClefableMewTogekissUmbreonCelebiFlorgesAnd of these only a couple can afford to use them. ChanseyBlissey Clefable Umbreon and Florges are the only pokemon that we really see acting as status clerics off the bottom ladder. The reason is that all the other mons have much better sets to run. Sure you could use Heal Bell Togekiss but why not run TWaveAir SlashRoostDefog? Mew is more comfortable as a bulky WillO with tons of other options like PsychicPsyshock SoftboiledRoost Stealth Rock Defog Super Fang UTurn etc. Celebi functions great as a Baton Passer but you never really see it used for its status cleric ability. My point is the only pokemon that really use Heal Bell for the most part are dedicated clerics. Their entire job is to support and heal their team and without Heal Bell they really fall flat.I assume you play with status heavy teams and it makes sense that you dislike the move but try to look at the scenario from another players point of view. Their main sweeper just got statused. Its not hard to status a sweeper considering all the Pranksters running around and with Thunder Wave at  accuracy and WillO at  these moves generally find their mark. Sweepers get statused it happens. Does that mean the player now should now lose the game since their Mega Lopunny has been parad?Some teams need a Heal Bell. If your team truly needs heavy support its worth it to stick a Heal Bell Clefable on your team instead of a CMSoftboiledMoonblastFlamethrower variant. Otherwise how can you realistically deal with all the status in every tier on every level of the ladder?Its also worth mentioning that running the move itself is kind of a risk. There are definitely teams youll come up against that barely use status if at all. In this case your Heal Bell is literally useless. In addition even when you DO use Heal Bell youre essentially giving your opponent a free turn to switch into a favorable matchup or set up or kill you then status more of your pokemon unopposed. This is how you counter Heal Bell  take advantage of the free turn!Heal Bell is a perfectly reasonable move and without it status would absolutely be overpowered wed see far less sweepers and more stall mons everywhere. Its a necessary move for a balanced meta.I just spent half an hour writing about fucking Heal Bell and now Im gonna go rethink my life,stunfisk,d3rdy2l,24,t5_2sn6d

Im not sure what you meant byspecial move thingy but Im thinking it might be one of those .  Sludge Bomb gt Shadow Ball on Gengar. Because Xerneas  Iron Fist gt Guts on Conkeldurr. Burn is a very uncommon status in VGC . In this meta Gengars almost never carry WillOWisp according to the Pokemon Global Link only  of Gengars use WillOWisp. You would only have to worry about Burns if a Kyogre Scalds you but that one scenario isnt enough to warrant using Guts IMO. The only status you see often is Paralysis and Sleep. Paralysis is primarily used as a form of Speed control but since Conkeldurr is already so slow you wont really need to worry about it getting Paralyzed meaning no Guts proc. Additionally Conkeldurr cannot attack while it is asleep meaning it cannot take advantage of Guts.  Ice Punch gt Fire Punch on Conkeldurr. Ice Punch hits all relevant Grass types except for Ferrothorn just as hard as Fire Punch does but you already have Drain Punch to hit Ferrothorn super effectively. Ice Punch allows you to deal big damage to Salamence and Rayquaza  of the most common Pokemon in the format. Youre only using one restricted Pokemon. There is no reason not to use two and by only using one youre handicapping yourself. To be completely honest Swampert Conkeldurr and Bisharp arent all that viable in VGC  I suggest you look into replacing them with a restricted at least.

8430046,0,t3_4uyhz2,Hey SkyRocket I am not super experienced in doubles but I have played it so maybe I can give some advice. I will however be focusing more on giving general advice about getting better. By the way this will be a LONG post as I will try to cover as much as I can so please read this when you are comfortable I will talk about two things  How I think you should practice. This is what you mainly asked for so you can just read this section if you want What you really need to learn to be as strategically developed as possible though I may miss some things which I hope the rest of the community will fill in for me. Number  on this list is the most doublesfocused advice so look at that if you have the time.So first I will talk about how to practice properly. This is what you mainly asked about so I guess you can just read this part but its up to you As everyone else had said the best thing to do is practice. Practice makes perfect and it doesnt have to be perfect practice. I remember when I first started out in Showdown I would ask someone in the chat to battle and I would just battle anyone. Before the battle started I would let them know about the team strat and would ask them to help me out by giving me advice in the end. In doing so I get a better understanding of how I can make the team itself better. So in terms of making a perfect practice I would do two things Watch replays of higherlevel on showdown or YouTube and pause between each move and think yourself why did the person do that? or what would I do? Asking yourself this and checking with the moves that the higherlevel player did will help you better understand how to overcome some situations. Even if the player did not use your mons since their mon may have a similar function to a mon you have. Even if they misplayed you can learn from that and think of what you would have done instead. Request battles in chats on Showdown for those who are willing to give advice after battling. Despite the colorful language that you may often find in Showdown the people there are all generally very nice and willing to help you. Be willing to ask for advice and what not.Now for things to watch for in battle since there are a lot of those things.. In terms of actual battle practice again is key. However as they say slow and steady wins the race. Never rush for your move. Take at least a good  seconds or so for thinking about what you need to do. Generally the biggest mistake new players make is that they just go for making the move that would cause for the most damage to the pokemon that they see right in front of them without thinking about whether or not the opponent may switch out into a mon that would resist the move. This is especially something youll find in doubles. The key is being patient and thinking at least  or  moves in advance. Its basically chess as in you have to have some goal. . Speaking of chess its always a good choice to do moves on purpose that will force your opponent to do a specific move even if the move does not accomplish the original effect of that move. For example lets say I am facing a team that uses trick room and that is their main strat. A strat I have noticed with trick room teams that has been effective is having a mon that can use a status move like yawn which will allow you to have a free turn to set up trick room. For example if a Uxie uses yawn then I feel somewhat compelled to switch to a different mon and the turn I switch can be used by that Uxie to set up Trick Room which may then screw me over big time.The purpose of yawn in that scenario was not to actually make my mon to go sleep but rather to set up trick room safely. This takes me to the point I mentioned before which was to think outside of the box. Yawn is a move generally intended to make the opposing mon fall asleep but it was used differently to allow for a safe trick room set up in the example above. . Using that example with trick room I also will make another point which is that it is important to figure out what your opponents teams function is. Is it a trick room reliant team? Is a Rain Dance reliant team? Is it just a balanced team? Is it a stall focused team? Knowing this will help you develop a strat. Its just like in chess as some players have different play styles. How fast you can adapt will determine a win or loss. Given your adaptability no pun intended will only improve by practicing.  . Another thing to consider in terms of improving your strategy is predicting switches. One of the biggest things that higherlevel players take into consideration is whether or not the opponent will switch and if so whether or not you should switch. I have seen many matches where both players have decided to switch and this made the advantage suddenly switch over as that gave the player with a higher advantage a free mon that they can crush or a turn where they may be able to set up traps. Predicting switches is a major skill you will need to do well in whatever tier you play. . Another thing that I have seen new players have trouble with is being open to switching. Many players for some reason unconsciously have this instinct or something that they must play with a certain mon until it faints. However thats not necessarily the most strategic thing. Being open to switching based off of the situation will be key especially in the early and late game. . Another thing to make sure you have in your mind is that TYPE ADVANTAGE IS NOT EVERYTHING. Please please please you dont know how many people I have seen get rolled over because they think that as long as they have the type advantage gg they win. Most mons have some way of overcoming their type disadvantages in a way that may very well lead to a OHKO and perhaps a full on sweep. The only time that type advantage can really exert its potential to the max is when you are also faster than the opposing mon. Speaking of which knowing your speed tiers is also recommended as that factors into switches. . Speaking of speed tiers its a good idea to keep in mind the range of speed the opposing mon has as this will be a big factor into whether or not you will switch or not to avoid getting your mon killed. . Here is advice more focused towards doubles and thats to look at the synergy of the typing of the mons on the field both you and your opponent.  For example if your opponent has a ground type and a flying type mon or a ground and a mon that has the ability levitate then you may think in your head Oh he might go for using Earthquake. Crap that can OHKO or HKO a mon which I want to use to counter some other mon he has that still isnt out of the game yet. With this you may act accordingly by doing the switches necessary or what not. Type synergy is key in doubles as it can often lead to forced switches on the opponents part or your part. It can also lead to really effective plays that can shut down opponents mons unexpectedly as well.. Last but not least know the mons in your team and your opponents team. This means that you need a lot of experience as that will let you automatically recognize sets and functions of mons. A lot of mons in general have a specific function. Sweeper wall cleric etc. Know what mon associates with what function and battle accordingly. Your opponent has a wall up? Bring in the wall breaker. Having a wide knowledge of what function your opponents and your mon have will help you predict what your opponents moveset stats even speed and item may very well be which will let you adjust accordingly. Ive gone through most of the tiers and studied a lot of the mons in each tier. In the end the name of the game is manipulation. You want to make the game go at your pace not your opponents so adapt to the situation well and work towards a strat that can let you control whats going on. Well I know this was really long and so I hope I helped. ,stunfisk,d5vaow2,1,t5_2sn6d

Para can stop status moves by PARALYZING. You know that Grass resists electric right?What on earth are you going on on? Sub stops prio moves because you cannot get statusedoneshot by a move behind a sub? If youre coming in against Slowbro press Sub then Leafstorm then your enemy has to send something in that can tank a move and still kill you after breaking sub. If you have Glare your enemy can send in Starmie Talonflame Weavile Gengar Jirachi Klefki SableyeM or Thundurus and you have to give up everything and switch to not get oneshot or crippled and since hes hyperoffense he shouldnt be doing safety switches all too often because he has no recovery and no Wall core.And Paralyzing your enemy clefable is not going to stop her from doing the same to you leaving you basically useless because a  speed Serperior is as useful as Specially offensive Ferrothorn. Having subbed instead you can avoid getting Paralyzed Toxicedwhatever because they cant do that because the sub exists?Glare is also a move that you have to set up against every mon youre going againstthat you need to cripple Sub you only need to refresh sometimes when the enemy could break it. And yes grass resists electric the HP FireIce that the MagnezoneManectricM is gonna run or the PranksterThunderwave that comes out of Thundurus are not so resistable. Zapdos Heatwave also loves you. gtBased on your comments Im pretty sure you dont actually even play much.I actually play really often but I could say the same for you seeing that you cant really see that his mons have to work differently based on the fact that hes playing hyperoffense.,stunfisk,d6ipq0l,0,t5_2sn6d
8617973,0,t3_4xv632,i think the priority when building a stall team is to improve its matchup vs other stall team since this archetype is becoming so common at the top of the ladder.clefable and heatran are a good step in that direction i feel with some changes to their sets however running that sableye set in combination with no defog will make you autolose to almost any clefable stall because they will set up the stealth rock on your sableye and you will not be able to spin them away unless you get lucky fishing for burns as tenta vs sab but in the long run that wont work.so i think that sableye should just use his standard set of knock wow recover filler and tenta should go in favor of skarmory which helps you a lot vs some recent meta trends like sr defensive excadrill while also providing a ground immunity that the team was lacking. idt spikes are a necessity on skarmory but i feel like that boils down to personal preferences.i would shift the sr from chansey to either clefable or heatran and replace it with toxic. this is kind of an insurance policy against the rise of zapdos as a defogger.fire blast on slowbro is kind of reduntant considering that ferrothorn wont do anything vs this team as sableye completely shuts him down and heatran is probably the hardest counter to scizor in the tier. it should be replaced by either twave toxic or calm mind each of them have their own pros and cons again it boils down to personal preferences. also i would shift some evs to spdef as this will be your only answer to keldeo if you replace tentacruel.speaking of heatran it should be way faster than this  speed is a good benchmark since it outpace mega heracross at max speed with positive nature and bisharp. if you feel thats too much you should at least run  to outpace max adamant mega heracross and almost every fast scizor.  to outpace breloom and bisharp.if you end up putting sr on heatran it should probably replace flash cannon since opposing clef are handled by your own clef  chansey and diancie is threatened by earth power and the burn chance of lava plume anyway.i like ft on unaware clef for excadrill and bisharp mostly i feel like flash cannon is more expendable as a stealth rock fodder so i would probably put sr on heatran.i feel like its a pretty solid team though it can be kinda weak to bisharp and some weird  attack offensive mega scizor sets depending on heatrans speed but i think that theres not much that can be done about that if you dont run quagsire over clef but that makes you lose to other things anyway manaphy. also focus punch breloom could be hard to deal with since it can v skarmory to an extent.,stunfisk,d6iugkt,1,t5_2sn6d

8653416,0,t1_d6n9rah,No. Gems boosted the power of a move you already have the defining difference here it seems is that the ZMove is a move of its own. Think about some of the less powerful attacking types Thats big for them. Unless youre playing in Rain stuff like Thunderbolt and Wild Charge are the best Electric attacks youre going to get. You cant hit hard with Thunder because its got such bad accuracy but with a special ZMove you have something that is not only accurate but at the same time stronger than Thunder. Same with Poison Most of the time the best youll get is Sludge Bomb  If the ZMove is  BP its almost two Sludge Bombs in one.There is a downside to it though I admitv is slower and itll probably matter less there. The main use will be in places like VGC where you only need to use that move once to achieve a goal of breaking something down. Its like the whole v uses Leftovers and VGC preferred stuff like Sitrus. v will probably prefer to just use LO over the ZMove.But still.

This applies to pokemon that cant be caught in any area that it isnt supposed to be. If a legendary or ditto has a memory or can be seen as being hatched from an egg other than the two exclusive breedables itll be labeled as hacked.Pokemon with no memories catch location hatch location or evolving at the wrong level can also tell if a pokemon is hacked or not the OT and the ID of the pokemon can also lead to a cloned pokemon which is hacked.If youre going to use hacked pokemon though I wouldnt say that its fair for you to compete in VGC since it can be awfully unfair.,stunfisk,d6nj28m,-4,t5_2sn6d

They have had years of practice and holding yourself to thier standards will likely leave you disappointed and salty.That being said we still have a few months before SuMo comes out and until the VGC rules are announced the fall tournaments will be played with the current VGC rules. Go to some of these events play and learn. Done expect to win every match and go in with the mentality of improvement.The thing that separates casual from competitive players is hard work and determination and the thing that separates good players from great players is dedication and a willingness to learn from your mistakes.VGC will likely be based off of VGC rules so it is likely we will see Alolan Dex Pokmon only be allowed to participate in .

Not only is Persian sporting a fantastic  bulk it has a literally unparalleled  attack stat. To top it off a Zubat learns Persians best coverage move at level . Obviously the reason to use this bad boy over MLopunny which has literally twice the attack stat or some legitimately good normal type is because youre such a good player that you dont need good Pokmon to win. Or because you only want to use a strong move like Retaliate once rather than have a consistent option like Return although I guess youll faint before you can use two attacks so it doesnt really matter. Who needs High Jump Kick when you can have HP Ground? You really showed that Heatran! I see your counter to ferrothorn is to click the X button in the top left corner either before or after you die to gyro ball when you miss Hypnosis. You asked US for competitive advice for using Persian and we are telling you that THERE ARE LITERALLY NO REASONS TO USE PERSIAN IN OU OR EVEN UU UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE.

I am left with Cheat.And its all a moot point anyway considering hacking in the VGC goes unpunished and for that I have two examples A How many competitive players have played the twitter game of taking pictures of themselves laptops open on a pokemon hacking program next to judges or even with judges looking directly at the screen because they dont know what it is or just dont care. B Ray Rizzo yes its been discussed to death but the objective facts are he had an illegal ball the rules state it is unacceptable he had an excuse his friend bred it again the rules say that is unnaceptable and what happens to him? nothing... Oh wait no thats right he got to be involved in the tournaments in an official capacity as a commentator which is on payrollSo if they dont even punish hackers that get caught or pay attention to having the hacking rubbed in there faces at the damn tournaments then why put up this farce of trying to make hacking less of an ideal option? no matter how easy breeding gets Instant Mix Pokemon will always be easier and to the people that cheat that is all that matters.,stunfisk,d8p68h8,1,t5_2sn6d

A heavily damaged counter can serve as one. Example Weavile checks Latios.This however is not fully correct because some checks do have the ability to switch in. For example RotomW is used as a common check to LandorusT because it takes  max from Stone Edge and is immune to EQ.The thing that makes RotomW a check and not a counter is its lack of recovery meaning Landorus can eventaully wear it down enough to kill it with Stone Edge.,stunfisk,d8tcrms,3,t5_2sn6d

9448132,0,t3_5a3kqt,Rain is great in bsd but the execution here could be better. What is the purpose of scizors spread? Does jolly outspeed anything relevant is the sdef really needed? Using an adamant nature gives a lot more stats since natures go by  of the stats and the attack is much higher than the speed. Scizors speed is kinda weird. Bullet punch makes it outspeed  speed sylveonfor mega mence under tailwind already but the speed tier is good for fast aegislash with knock off after a swords dance. The moveset is also not too great. Recovery only works on a few pokemon in doubles well like calm mind cress arcainine gastrodon milotic and wow charizard x since the pokemon will probably be dead or be put into range for death again after using a recovery move just doesnt really accomplish anything. Switching in vgc doesnt occur enough for pursuit to be good. Struggle bug is cool and has seen use on pokemon like rage powder volc but considering scizors more offensive nature it just doesnt really accomplish anything that would win a game than another move would. Also protect. Use it in doubles. Its the best move in the game to stop double targeting allow for an ally to kill a threat safely stall out weathertrick roomtailwind turns. Unless all four moves are needed for specific situations use protect.  Honestly mscizor is a bit niche in vgc. It has seen usage but in general mence metagross mawile or kang do better on rain teams. Mence kills amoonguss which is a god send for rain teams since amoonguss is really annoying especially since fire types can be difficult to use on rain teams. They actually are used just for amoonguss for as counter productive as it may seem. Metagross is great aginst gardimoonus despite the fact that metagross cant hko amoonguss reliably. Also rain helps with heatran and zard for metagross and sub metagross can be amazing. Kangaskhan is just good plain and simply.  Tornadus is just kinda meh. Inaccurate moves are the biggest factor in this despite rain making hurricane  accurate. The fact that zardy ttar and rain does expire makes hurricane unreliable.  is a fair amount when youre playing and using hurricane a lot. Kingdra is cool although muddy water or sub is a bit better over ice beam. Draco ohkos mence already and scald in the rain actually does more than ice beam to landorus. Sub helps against thundurus which is the biggest stop to rain and muddy water is good but inaccurate spread damage. Lum ludicolo is now my go to for rain now since thundurus is used so much and such a threat so lum is another great option. Kabotops did top cut a nationals and has the niche of beating zard y with sash and rock slide but its still niche. Intimidate is so prevalent that its hard to use kabotops. Rotom wash isnt really accomplishing much that the other rain users do already. The other rain users beat landorus already and thundurus or zapdos is the much better electric for prankster twavetaunt or tailwind. Plus rotom is so overrated by the fact that it just dies so easily and non ghost typefor kang slow will o wisp is just so bad and unreliable. Kang is literally doing  to you with a sitrus just to will o wisp it then after its done a lot of damage. A bit of a tangent but still. Politoed spread and moveset could use work. Something like hpdefsattack calm nature can ensure survivial from kangs double edge a hydreigons specs draco meteor and ohko landorus with scald in the rain. Sitrus safety googles or wacan are better items to either take attacks better help against amoonguss so you can continue to support or wacan to take a hit better from thundurus. Going the sitrus route also allows you to invest a bit more into special defense since kangs attacks hit twice thus proking sitrus after the first hit so it can survive a bit easier. Why eq? Non stab eq already does  damage not factorinig a politeod. Helping hand allows for ohkos especially onto kang in the rain ice beam hits mence. Encore and perish song can be fun to shut down something like fake out to lock them into fake out or another move and perish song can be used as a fun win condition if the opponent only has two mons. Helping hand is the better option though since it can allow the rain users to net tons of ohkos quicklyStealing other rain teams for nb or smogon is a good option but the team is workable. Personally Id put mega mence on to beat amoonguss and the rare venusaur since it hits like a truck. Also intimidate is nice. Look at nb here or smogon for spreads. After that just putting standard mons should work. Rainmence pretty much compliment each other although redirection for something with something like  amoonguss or a faster timid thundurusoutspeeding base s or jolly landorus is nice if your not going lo timidtaunt helps a lot against thundurus which is annoying to rain. Using lum ludicolo or kingdra allows them to safely ohko thundurus with hydro pumphelping hand in the rain without getting thunder waved but hydro misses more than it should. ,stunfisk,d9dm7z2,2,t5_2sn6d

9474193,0,t3_5adepj,gtFurious Georgelol nice one.Magmar with Follow MeFlame Body is pretty interesting but its still relatively frail even with Eviolite. Noncontact spread moves like Earthquake and Rock Slide are going to be quite prevalent so I dont think hes doing a whole lot for you. A Drought Ninetails set with WilloWisp Protect DisableSolar Beam FlamethrowerFire Blast could work. Drought keeps the sun up and halves damage from Watertype attacks. Protect lets you scout RockGround attacks and then you can Disable them. Disable is an Egg move from the Golduck line.Since you have a decent amount of offensive pressure between Charizard Infernape and Talonflame you might consider a more defensive Arcanine. Specially defensive with WilloWisp maybe redundant with IntimidateWoW on MagmarNinetails FlamethrowerFire BlastFlare Blitz Morning SunProtectExtreme SpeedSnarl.You probably need to use Protect a lot more.

Attack and Speed is a good bet with either scarf to make sure you outspeed everything without a scarf or specs to make sure you OHKO everything. Just try not to get baited into hitting Muk with your psychic. Really lele doesnt want to be fighting muk at all since he resists fairy as well and kills you with poison jab. You can easily ko alolowak with psychic if it doesnt have any sp. Def investment but Im not sure on the calcs if it is invested.

9838901,0,t1_daq0ba4,The only pokemon Ive had success with other than the three I mentioned would be Toxapex and Dragonite.Toxapex can actually sweep even better than mimiyku but you need a LOT of patience to Toxic everything and you need to MAX PP its recover.Toxapex  HPDef holding Black Sludge But you can take a Rocky Helmet I just like sustain more. Toxic Haze So you dont become a setup bait Scald This is your one and only worthwhile damaging move outside  RecoverIve actually taken off Scald and replaced it with Mirror Coat to make it even more of a wall. But then youre reliant  on Toxic.Weaknesses Any pokemon with Rest. Any pokemon immune to Toxic Skarmory Metagross SteelsPoisons. Espeon Though Ive only ever run into one on my th battle.Someone in the other comments suggested Muk and Im seriously considering it. Im a bit worn out from breeding ATM Have  different IV Pokemon all above  with EVs and everything so will do it later.As a side note there are three EXTREMELY infuriating pokemon they can use and you need to deal with them ASAP. Glaceon has Rest with a berry and will up its defence and sp.def to the point of infuriation. Only way to deal with it is to wait for it to rest and swords dance to the point of  hit. This is hard.Theres another pokemon name I cant remember but its an ice type monstrosity that also has high def rest. If your  sweepers are dead then youre not going to dent it at all.Metagross should work just need it to have high enough HPDEF to survive for  swords dance. I find that every time I lose its because of Mimiyku misses Rough Play twice or more in a row. Im mad I just lost my  streak because the goddamned Espeon dodged it THREE times in a row and swept me after Status conditions. This is why I have Scizor and Golisopod.

9918834,0,t1_db0ez6z,Dont worry about bothering me! I enjoy competitive theorymoning and if I wasnt enjoying this I wouldnt put effort into replying PThe big question you need to answer when planning out any Pokemon is what role you want it to fill. Are you looking for a sweeper? A revengekiller? Something bulky that can take a few hits and dish out some damage in return? In particular its good to look at what opposing Pokemon you need help taking out that will be difficult for your team to deal with and then pick Pokemon and sets that counter that.Without knowing what threats you feel youre facing and what role youre trying to fill its hard for me to fully know the best set. That being said Ill do my best for an Ataglance set.Bulky Attacker SetTurtonator  Assault Vest  Ability Shell Armor  EVs  HP   SpA   SpD  Modest Nature  IVs  Atk   Fire Blast   Overheat   Draco Meteor   Focus BlastFor this set we put EVs into Special Attack and HP to emphasize bulk and power. Just as a general note you should almost always prioritize EVs in HP before EVs in Defense since it usually does a better job of helping you survive. Additionally the Assault Vest will already help bulk up Turts SpDef so it isnt really necessary to invest significant EVs in it. I got rid of Shell Trap and put on Overheat instead because I dont think Shell Trap is really that good... you have to get hit by a physical move for it to activate which is pretty limiting for a very small power increase over Overheat.This set focuses on dishing out a lot of damage while staying on the field for a little while taking a few hits.Wall Set Turtonator  Sitrus Berry  Ability Shell Armor  EVs  HP   SpA   SpD  Calm Nature  IVs  Atk   WillOWisp   Fire Blast   Toxic   TauntThis set has the goal of taking hits and being hard to kill. Turtonator has a great defensive typing that will do great for switchins. WilloWisp lets you cripple physical attackers. Toxic is for stallingbreaking walls. Fire Blast lets you do some damage even uninvested. Taunt is for stopping setups when you get the chance.Shell Smash Sweeper Turtonator  White Herb  Ability Shell Armor  EVs  SpA   SpD   Spe  Modest Nature  IVs  Atk   Shell Smash   Fire Blast   Draco Meteor   Flash CannonThis one is simple. Shell Smash then sweep. Easy as that.I hope these sets give you a good start. You can always swap out moves as you see fit. Let me know if you have any other questions.,stunfisk,db0g6nx,2,t5_2sn6d

10006083,0,t3_5ivw00,If youre having trouble getting Rests off with AMuk Id suggest running Shadow SneakProtect instead of RestSleep Talk. Shadow Sneak is very helpful for picking off weakened targets and you can never really go wrong with Protect.Running Protect with Specs on Tapu Koko is a bit odd. Getting locked into that move will basically force you to switch after only one use. I havent really used Koko myself but HP Ice could be useful in that slot for dealing with Ground types. Alternatively you could give him a Life Orb and keep Protect instead. TboltDischarge still hit super hard under Electric Terrain with a Life Orb. Personally I much prefer Pelipper over Politoed for rain.  accurate STAB Hurricane is really good. Id try altering the EV spread a bit and giving him more Special Attack. At minimum Id go  SpA EVs to get a guaranteed OHKO on HPSpD AMarowak in the rain.  SpA EVs would net a guaranteed OHKO on uninvested Tapu Bulu with Hurricane. Those are just a couple examples.Your team also lacks any kind of speed control. AMuk Gastrodon and Gigalith are all pretty slow which can benefit from Trick Room. If thats not your thing you could try swapping out Uturn or Roost on Pelipper and give him Tailwind instead. Id also recommend running Protect on most if not all of your Mons. Protect is super important in VGC and its almost always worth the move slot unless youre running something with Choice ScarfSpecsBand.Those are just some things that I think need a bit of touchingup.

Nobody has Protect there are Stealth Rocks there isnt much defense on the team and it looks like the team is trying too hard to play the long game. VGC matches are roughly  turns long on average dont feature many switches and have a high importance on abilities and attacks that affect multiple Pokmon at once. Definitely get some research in theres plenty to learn when you come from Singles into VGC ,stunfisk,dbq2qi1,3,t5_2sn6d

10161043,0,t3_5kcdxu,My husband and I are feeling completely overwhelmed so I hope we can find some help here.Weve decided for the first time in our lives to do end game related stuff in Pokemon.  We dont necessarily want to go into competitive just yet but first we want to make a solid team for the Battle Tree.  Still looking at anything online seems so filled with jargon from competitive we just dont know what anyone is talking about.We know what IVs and EVs are.  We know about natures abilities and so on.  We know about Smogon.  Where we get completely lost is...what Pokemon do we use?  Where can we go for finding out how to even build a team for Battle Tree?  People will show their teams but not explain why they chose the Pokemon and abilities they did.  Everyone talks as if we should already know why they are doing what they are doing.  But we dont...and we want to learn.I also feel like theres no beginner mode.  It feels like you have to read a novel and then youre not done yet.  I get that in order to play competitively its going to be like this.  Theres a LOT in Pokemon its going to be complicated.  But there doesnt seem to be any intermediary levels.  Nothing to actually teach and explain.  And no we havent found the beginners guides on Smogon to be helpful.  I mean were trying to get used to things not actually make a full competitive team.We havent been able to find anything helpful.  If anyone knows of someplace that could wed be really appreciative.  Walls of text dont really help us either.  Its not really how we learn.  Were going to continue to search but we do appreciate any help we can get.Thank you.,stunfisk,dbvt72j,2,t5_2sn6d

10293756,0,t1_dcaqhgb,Cool!  Ill just start throwing some things out there.  Some are hard suggestions and some are things you can mess around with.  For their natures play around with speed reducing ones.  I dont know much about EV spreads so I wont say much to that effect.  I do wonder about some of the move sets on these.  Fini probably wants at least Scald and Moonblast for heavy STAB action.  For a item Fini probably wants to have Leftovers to help keep it around longer.  I have seen some Calm Mind sets that I think could be run effectively and give you a potential wincon outside of Trick Room.Tapu FiniLeftoversAbility Misty SurgeEvs  HP  Sp. Attack  DefenseSassy NatureIce BeamCalm MindSurfScaldMoonblastMagnezone probably wants to run something other than Gyro Ball.  If you are able to give it HP fire that would be great for coverage.  It would probably do well holding Choice Specs.  That would lock it into one move but it would hit like a truck.AMarowak needs to be holding a Thick Club.  That doubles his atk stat so it gives him a nice niche as a physical attacker.  Shadow Bone is his best ghost type attack and you can choose if you want to run EQ or Bonemarang.  Also he gets Flare Blitz which gives him a massive Fire STAB attack.  After that a lot of people like to run Will o Wisp but I think there are other options depending on what you want.  Sorry thats a lot Im trying to respond while at work. Ill look this over again when Im home and let you know if I think of anything else,stunfisk,dcauq1e,3,t5_2sn6d

In conjunction with a tool that calculates speed you can figure out raw speed to base speed conversions possibly including multipliers so you can understand what your speed is doing.Uninvested speed neutral Minior is equivalent to a fully invested base  speed pokemon. So pretty much every point of speed you add is going to help you outspeed something that actually might invest in speed until you get to Mega Salamence which Jolly ties. base  doesnt even register in the top  anymore.By running Adamant you are outsped by base  and higher rather than base . That means youre outsped by fully invested Kartana and ANinetails who sit at . That might not be a terrible thing.

10522976,0,t1_dd0tn1l,I think it was a combination of a lot of things. Winning a lot definitely didnt help lol. I wasnt a fan of a lot of the changes that were being introduced as well with Megas and Pokemon becoming so offensive making resistances kind of meaningless. But I was also graduating college at the time and needed to focus on my life IRL. There was a lot of stress on trying to get a job which despite having a good major wasnt that easy to get without any internships. At the end of the day I felt like I accomplished everything I wanted to in Pokemon so I decided to put it to the side. I still loved Pokemon and loved hanging out with all the friends I made at events through my years playing so I continued to attend tournaments and even started commentating. But now that my life is pretty settled down and its been a few years since I last had a high finish and a few years since I even competed in general I felt the desire to get back into it.  The talent within the playerbase has absolutely increased its insane compared to even  years ago. Its become much more accessible for people to get into VGC and make good teams ingame theres a number of great resources out there for improving and practicing. I love seeing how much its grown. My chances this year probably not great. Im so rusty lol. Im slowly feeling like Im improving at least but Im not back to where I used to be yet. I think knowing damage calcs and predictions are the two biggest things Im still not my old self at. And those things come more from experience than anything so I guess its expected Im not at an elite level on those yet  .I did from . But not since then. Ever since I got into VGC Ive never looked back. I like doubles way too much haha.Snorlax!!! Metagross is a close second since theres a Ray Rizzos Metagross event distribution lol ,stunfisk,dd0w5pk,6,t5_2sn6d

10683684,0,t1_ddhw5ij,Problem with araquanid is that its very difficult for it to come in as its very slow. It also takes way too much from rocks and gets worn down easily. Also this does aggravate your electric weakness. I think running brave bird on koko to deal with bulky grasses is still worth to deal with bulky grasses. Araquanid cant really beat spore amoongus unless electric terrain is up and doesnt take on tangrowth very well. Thing with alolawak is that it wont hit very hard in rain and just adds more of a stealth rock weakness. Under rain it wont hurt mega saur at all and itll struggle with knock off growth. Bulky grasses are definitely an issue for rain though. What do you think about using supersonic skystrike landorus therian? You could try a double dance variant with rock polish and swords dance. Earthquake and fly and use supersonic skystrike to destroy the grasses and you arent elec weak anymore.,stunfisk,ddhxw4k,1,t5_2sn6d

10695916,0,t3_5sv5ec,A lot of people including tennisace v me ou bro have talked about gains. But i want to touch on a type that I feel has lost a lot. Grass types. Now grass types have always been solid but in gen  having grass typing was really quite a boon. Yes you had  weaknesses the most of any type at the time fire ice poison bug and flying.  But  of those  had no real users. Flying bug and poison all had no moves that people used. Fire types were also not very common as most fire types just werent great the best being fire spin trapping moltres. Most grass types being part poison sucked at the time due to the prevalence of psychic types but exeggutor being the monster that it was showed how good grass was back then. Access to amazing support moves resistances to  of the most common attacking moves in the game along with only  commonly seen weakness made grass types defensive behemoths. Now despite all the new tools that grass types got better STABS better support moves etc. Flying poison fire and bug have all become powerful offensively. This really took a toll on grass types being defensive and their offensive prowess wasnt super great either. Being resisted by so many types is really unfortunate.,stunfisk,ddj7cyc,5,t5_2sn6d

10825070,0,t3_5uq93o,gt Choice Scarf puts me at . not sure if counted as  or Just fyi everything in Pokemon gets rounded down. So youd have  speed rather than .Everything being rounded down is also why you probably want for example Tsareena to have  HP EVs so she gets an uneven HP number. This helps with switching in to hazards more often. A general rule of thumb is to try and get an uneven HP number.Staraptor is an even better example as you now have  HP which is exactly divisible by  meaning you go down after a th SR switchin. If you put those  EVs in DefSpD instead youll be able to survive the th switchin.Essentially due to how everything gets rounded down you take a little less damage.Just a minor nitpick perhaps but small things like this can add up. These changes wont make or break your team but theres really no reason not to implement these best practices. The same principle can be applied to minimize LO damage for example.,stunfisk,ddwj2ue,3,t5_2sn6d

And yeah get rid of Quick Claw regardless.Separately Id consider replacing Celesteela whos weak to the type your weather is boosting or Oranguru with a second Firetype.Overall you need to commit to TR or drop it.

Lots of the bulky mons in the format dont take much damage from Muk after the initial Knock Off so things like Celesteela and Gastrodon fare well  but cant really protect their partner from Muk because they have to slowly whittle down Muk.Theres also the option of just winning the damage trade which stuff like Hariyama does. Gigalith and Araquanid can also overpower it.If Tapu koko is one of your mons then having volt switch can be handy vs Muk  it deals good damage and protects Koko so long as you have a good switchin to Poison Jab.But these are all multi turn answers wheareas tectonic rage lets you just delete Muk in one turn.,stunfisk,de3wetx,2,t5_2sn6d

Pokemon have weaknesses and its your job to prevent them from being exploited.Youre extrapolating and assuming a lot of things here.  I think youre also forgetting that mixed attackers exist and with the distribution that special Fire Psychic and Fairy moves have its much more difficult to predict who is running them as coverage while you can see Ice Beam limited to basically Water and Ice types and Ice Shard exclusive to Icetype evolutionary lines coming from a mile away.  Just think about how many Pokemon use Hidden Power Fire as a coverage move. gt  SpA Life Orb Sheer Force Nidoking Flamethrower vs.  HP   SpD Bewear  .  .  guaranteed HKOgt  SpA Choice Specs Magnezone Hidden Power Fire vs.  HP   SpD Bewear  .  .  . chance to HKOgt gt  SpA Celesteela Flamethrower vs.  HP   SpD Bewear  .    . chance to HKOgt  SpA ManectricMega Flamethrower vs.  HP   SpD Bewear    .  . chance to HKOKeep in mind this is completely ignoring the fact that special Fire Psychic and Fairy types are currently overrepresented in the meta with the Tapus Alolan Marowak Latios HoopaU Magearna Necrozma Salandit Mega Alakazam Alolan Ninetales and etc. running rampant.  Even fully invested base  SpD just doesnt cut it and the Bewear isnt going to be around long enough to do anything if even a single special attacker remains.  The meta is just really unfriendly to this Pokemon right now and it requires a lot of work to put it to good use.Just get rid of all their specialmixed attackers get gud is much easier said than done and a good opponent isnt just going to toss all their special attackers at you when you have a slow physically defensive  Atk powerhouse like Bewear sitting in the back.  The main way Ive even gotten to get any decent use out of my Bewear is through Parting Shot or Aurora Veil which both capitalize on its natural bulk and potentially force switches but more often than not  out of  of the enemys team is either a special or mixed attacker andor a Fire or Fairy type which makes things difficult regardless.

11097235,0,t3_5yc2dz,If i were to buff stall i would make the moves they depend on stronger. One of the big complaints about stall is that the matches take too long. I think different type stealth rocks would be a huge help to get better coverage. Ice Fighting and Fire are some good candidates that hurt common hazard removers. Spikes would have two layers be equivalent to what is currently three. Toxics turn counter would start one higher than it currently is. More moves like Dragon tail of different types would be introduced.This is obviously too much. To balance that though damage calculations would be changed so that the smaller numbers of defense have a greater impact than larger numbers like a log function. This would leave sweepers unaffected mostly but mons with tons of bulk like toxapex would take a bit more damage. No specific numbers because a lot of balancing and testing would need to be done. Cant implement this in a day.Tldr Make stall go faster but be easier to break through. ,stunfisk,depv1fg,1,t5_2sn6d

It sounds like youre looking at Battle Spot Doubles?  Theres VGC battle spot and several smogon tiers for online play.  You can also aim for the battle tree or battle royal as PVE options and PVE is how to obtain a lot of competitive items. Id suggest looking around for a QR code to borrow a presetup team and playing that for a while just to get the feel for the meta and some of the basic strategies and combos out there things like trick room tailwind terrain wars weather wars fake out partners instruct intimidate stacking etc. Once youve got a handle on it try your hand at designing and building a team yourself.,stunfisk,dex832f,5,t5_2sn6d

11514712,0,t3_64c834,I like the vikavolt set personally i run HP Ice on mine to help deal with garchomp  krook but its probably not really a necessity. I think that since you have the option of tailwind it would be worth it to remove some speed EVs from chomp and invest more in bulk especially with how many things there are that can hit chomp super effectively. Same could be said for Attack EVs since you have swords dance you could get away with taking some out of attack not too much maybe just bringing it down to around  EVs If youre confident that you will be able to take opportunities each game to set up a swords dance.Fini looks good not having protect may come back to bite you but having the heal pulse option is very cool and will catch a lot of people off guard.Personally I find magnezone kind of weird here as you already have vikavolt. I get the synergy with psych up and calm mind but i still think it would be better to use something like celesteela or kartana if you want the steel typing. Obviously if using both magnezone and vikavolt has been working for you theres no reason to change it but it seems to me that they fill almost the same role.Pelipper looks very good i really like the set and the synergy with the rest of your team. I like Scald but recently ive seen quite a few pelippers using Brine in that slot. I cant speak to how good it is as ive never tried it but it looks very interesting and does hit harder than scald if the target is below  health.Muk also looks very solid. If you havent considered it yet take a look at running Imprison in the th slot. Poison Jab Knock Off Protect Imprison. Locks pokemon on the field out of using protect and knock off and basically autowins you the matchup against opposing muks. If you dont like it then i would stick with shadow sneak.,stunfisk,dg17019,3,t5_2sn6d
