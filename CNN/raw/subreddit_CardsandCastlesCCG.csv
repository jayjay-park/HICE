9179778,0,t1_d8eroo9,Thanks! Ill add them in the next part and give you credit.Some things first though...I might need to change it...gt Tramplex  can move over enemy units. Doing x damage to themNo offense but thats basically just fly  doing damage. Maybe a better one would be TRAMPLE Can go on top of enemy units. Doing so will deal x damage and knock them back one space. Would that be better? If you disagree Ill just add the one you listed. gt Long Reachx  if a unit is movingflying through it gets x damageWhile this is a great idea CnC movement might piss people off though... For example you have a  Shadow Drake  square away from the enemy castle. The enemy castle only has  hp and its SD. Theres a opponents Peasant who is in front of the castle with Long Reach. You can go around the peasant and destroy the castle but CnC movement causes you to go through the Peasant since the Drake has FLYING. You then lose because of it.                    C P SD                      C  Castle      P  Peasant      SD  Shadow Drake         EmptyOk that wasnt relevant but Ill add both. Idea one might need a change but Idea  is great! By the way do you want to fill in the Xs or do you me to do it?,CardsandCastlesCCG,d8flr1v,1,t5_3ffer

9256887,0,t3_576bzj,While it seems like a great idea I just worry about those who abuse it though...Like if theres someone with  accounts he can have a main account and  extra accounts. Then he can draw  peasant packs and if he gets something great like a Legendary or an Epic he can just sell those and donate the shards to his main account.Otherwise I really want this feature to be added... I have a friend who has everything and k shards with k CP.  ,CardsandCastlesCCG,d8pdl1o,2,t5_3ffer

9458944,0,t3_4v5z1h,Another thing Ive noticed recently after the first hit a unit with rampage moves again but the UI does not indicate that you are actually selecting where to move. In one instance it severely ruined my play as my unit was out of position. The second move should indicate which unit is moving and its available movement options like a normal move. It does not appear that you can moveattack with another unit ie you must chain your moves together with an individual unit that has rampage. Is this just me?,CardsandCastlesCCG,d9ezl9k,1,t5_3ffer
9484274,0,t1_d9hy1dd,He is not in fact wishing for prewarlock burn nerfs. If you noticed none of his suggestions included increasing Warlock burn damage.

9959562,0,t1_db51ksk,Point about tribal placement OkayCraxus He caps off a Greed deck but he is very combodependent and I feel he needs too much structure around him to work.Jonviev Mmm okay Ill move Shoden to B since lots of people seem to agree with you on that but I think Jonviev still belongs in B and only looks bad because her ability makes her seem limited to Knights.Fenrir The face damage is okay but he really only comes to the table as a momentumkeeper who keeps your offensive push by sticking right on to the Castle. As defense though if the enemy isnt already weakened he can kind of flop with  attack not being the most amazing stat unless youre hitting the Caslte with SD on the rampage.Vileroth You make a good point but he also just buys you time by just staying there forcing the opponent to keep their stronger units on hold for fear of losing them to Vileroth.Edit I have changed the tiers quite a bit and shuffled some units around not done yet though and wondering what your opinion is.I understand how they may be misleading in the sense that it seems like its just A better than B better than C but I think the descriptions do fit the purpose. They state A is good if you have the space B good in most but not all decks C like B but more situational D like C but without any great power and F as nearuseless. Ill reword A and B a bit but other than that I think its okay.,CardsandCastlesCCG,db5r95r,1,t5_3ffer
9960836,0,t3_5i1t2d,When I saw this I was expecting this to be a match from the  star tier. This is somewhat impressive I will give you that love the classic waytoolate Vampire though to be fair it looks more like the opponent had a really crappy hand and you were able to take advantage of it than really anything really strategic happened. Still props for the Vampire though still cant get over it.Also in the future dont show the opponents name. Im assuming you meant no harm but people get salty about that I know if that was me being your enemy this post would be twice as long and structured in the form of an essay why everything about your post shows your stupidity.,CardsandCastlesCCG,db5x86m,1,t5_3ffer

10107871,0,t3_5kkev5,I think common buildings should have a standard  health looking at you stables and dragon temple. That way a rare card like special delivery can see respectable use again in decks that arent focus based. That card should absolutely take out common buildings and punish archetype decks because literally nothing else does haha,CardsandCastlesCCG,dbp2exw,1,t5_3ffer
10268402,0,t3_5ms5im,Luck is definitely a factor but theres also the consideration of how you manage the deck. For example a Greed deck will usually have a higher chance than a Dragon deck of getting a bad hand because Greed will have more highcost units put in and will have a higher chance of drawing them.,CardsandCastlesCCG,dc7z9x2,2,t5_3ffer
10282261,0,t1_dc9jdnk,Well the idea that a good deck has half and half is also technically incorrect. I dont have hard evidence but I really doubt that people will say there deck is good because I have an almost even amount of every gold cost.,CardsandCastlesCCG,dc9ju2f,1,t5_3ffer

10571244,0,t3_5qw7cj,Not a bad deck but for a true RNG deck that would appease the gods you would need as little standard units as possible and heaps of cards like dragons hoard or call to war. But I am pleased with the fact that there is another RNG deck out there. By standard unit I mean the actual card itself. If that makes sense. P,CardsandCastlesCCG,dd6ca5c,1,t5_3ffer
