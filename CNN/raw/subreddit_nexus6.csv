The Nexus  display is going to be a current generation of AMOLED. Whether or not its called Super its probably comparable in features.edit  For those down voting me. Go look at the Wikipedia article on AMOLED. Under the heading Marketing Terms youll find Super AMOLED and the like.

Android is made to work on a lot of systems and be good at all of them thats why it is developed in java. The problem is that there is a lot of overhead associated with this type of development. Because iPhones have a dedicated hardware platform you can build your software to take advantage of that and more importantly disregard every other platform out there. The end result is a much faster but less portable solution thats why the iPhone performs so well and in extension why Macs generally perform better than thier PC counterparts why consoles can have such good graphics with crappy specs etc.Its a difference in ideologies and architecture specs in general mean nothing..,nexus6,cm2yyrc,10,t5_2vo75

I gave the X to the wife and I picked it up this morning and it just seems too small now.  Next is the screen.  Both the resolution and brightness seem much better to me contrary to benchmarks.  The resolution is AMAZING i never used the Note and is the best Ive ever seen on a phone.  I watched some videos and its just great. The camera and speakers are also much better then the X and the Xs speaker was no slouch.  The only disadvantages compared to the X is the one hand operation my hand actually got a little tired holding the N last night after using it for about  minutes but Im sure Ill get used to that.  Also the Active Display doesnt seem to pulse as much as the X did but it does show much more information.  If I can think of anything else Ill edit this.

2403376,0,t1_cm824dl,I just think Google screwed up the launch and the manufacturing and production to begin with by not caring andor underestimating demand. The lack of communication already says as much as well as the lackluster or nonexistent marketing and blog reveal. Typical Nexus launch. Motorola aside from the Moto  which is their first smartwatch so Im ignoring it dont seem to have any problems with the Droid Turbo and especially the Moto X. Lenovo has already fully taken over production and shut down the Texas facility and fully customizable Moto Xs shipping from Chinese factories are a full go with no hiccups. Every year around this time both Apple and Samsung tie up production in general so this year isnt any different. If you read the threads where people list their manufacturing dates from the box some literally have a one day turnaround from manufacture to shipping direct from China meaning they didnt stockpile enough to begin with and are not relying on freight. Whatever stock that was initially stuck on the west coast due to port slowdowns should have already arrived by now meaning there was very little of that to begin with to give to customers. The earliest manufacturing date Ive seen is  which sounds about right for an initial shipment so people with these that got them over two weeks later have the ones that were suppose to be stuck in freight but are not anymore.Theres also the possibility due to the niche nature of the QHD . AMOLED display Samsung didnt bother making a lot on hand and Google didnt bother requesting enough.,nexus6,cm8rl84,1,t5_2vo75

I checked my security area and it said I was encrypted still. SOB. i just removed encryption this time again... restored my backup via google when I signed in and have all  of my apps back with app data. I signed into everything and loaded everything up and no more lag AND security says encrypt phone which is good as before it said Encrypted instead. All i can say is that you have to take asking people what they think with a grain of salt. some people think they dont have a laggy device and to them it may not be and is just fine and if you weer to  hand that same device to someone else then they may think it does feel laggy. everyone has a different perception of things which really stinks when it comes to trying to ask people what they think about a common theme.,nexus6,cmow3pe,1,t5_2vo75

I think with the new system you can set an average brightness that you want and the display will illuminate to compensate for ambient light around your desired value whereas before setting the brightness to auto would override your choice. In other words in the old system if I like my screen at  and you at  if we both have auto enabled technically our displays would have the same brightness. In the current system with ambient enabled my display should be darker than yours even in the same environment. I usually prefer my display a bit on the dark side and when I enabled ambient and I was in a darker room the screen dimmed and turned to that pinkish hue people have been mentioning.

After that checking for updates said none available.  Still I was easily able to flash the factory image.I should note that I hadnt installed my Rogers SIM at this point simply because I hadnt cut it down to nano size at this point.

Every custom ROM had this issue as well even the Ubuntu Touch and Firefox OS ROM and possibly the Sailfish OS ROM if the camera ever actually worked. It does surprise me that Google never updated the hardware to solve that issue though. A lot of the bugs right now are just Lollipop bugs and eventually will be fixed.

Use glass protection to avoid scratches if using credit cards with the wallet. I would prefer the Wallet S over all other wallets because the phone is protected on all sides.

4757625,0,t1_ctu3yo0,Im pretty sure this is incorrect.  I think it does decrypt on the fly as data is read from flash into RAM.  If it decrypted the whole filesystem on boot youd either need enough RAM to hold everything in the filesystem up to  GB give or take or youd need to write a decrypted copy of your data to flash on each boot which would a Take a long time and b defeat the purpose of the encrypted file system because as soon as the power is cut there is a nice handy decrypted filesystem ready to be extracted from the flash memory.To answer OPs question the data on the flash is stored encrypted at all times.  There is specialized hardware in the phone that handles the encryption filesystem writes and decryption filesystem reads.  When the system boots it asks for your PIN which is a piece of the decryption key needed to access the contents of the filesystem.  For that entire boot cycle until the phone is shut off that key is kept in RAM for use when accessing the encrypted data on the flash.  The reason you can read pictures etc. through USB is because the phones OS is mediating these transactions and decrypting this data on the fly when your computer requests some piece of data from the filesystem.  The security advantage is that without the PIN to your phone the contents of the filesystem are completely inaccessible.  If the phone is off when the bad guys get it they cant boot it up to decrypt without the PIN.  If the phone is booted up when the bad guys get it they need your PIN or to be connected to a trusted Bluetooth device or to be in a trusted location etc. etc. depending on your security settings.  This is a really smart thing to do and there is little to no performance hit on the N because remember there is specialized hardware baked into the phone to do the cryptography on the fly.  It is possible to do this without the crypto hardware but then the crypto needs to be done in software i.e. by the CPU which eats up valuable cycles which CAN cause a SLIGHT performance hit.  Also a protip for those who live in the US A federal court recently ruled that if the police want to search your phone and it is encrypted legally it makes a difference what type of unlocking mechanism you use.  If your phone is decrypted using a fingerprint they can execute a search of your person and use the fingerprint they find in their search to decrypt your phone and search it this also applies to facial recognition by the way.  However if you use a PIN or a password instead that is something that comes from your brain and therefore would have to come as the result of questioninginterrogation.  Because you have the right to remain silent and a right against selfincrimination they cannot force you to give up the password at least legally.  TLDR Encrypt your phone there is little to no downside and use a PIN or password rather than a fingerprint which you dont need to worry about on the N anyway. ,nexus6,ctu8snz,3,t5_2vo75

5079060,0,t3_3kkogp,Allows applications access to accomplish different things.  For example the notification light that is present in the phone but disabled on factory software builds.  With root access and an application like lightflow you can regain traditional led notifications and customize led color for various applications.Thats just an example.  Root with something else like Xposed framework enables custom UI changes that would otherwise require a custom OS ROM rather than a simple tweak.Nexus users dont typically lose out on updates because they are rooted only the automatic ota updates.  But nexus Android builds are generally uploaded by Google to the factory images site where a user can manually flash the update.  I have gotten in the habit of simply fastboot flashing the imgs from an updated factory image if I want to update.You can also create a system backup unroot and flash the stock build and take an ota.  Then restore you user or system data after the ota installs.Edit dyac,nexus6,cuy7vzf,3,t5_2vo75

That means not just phone numbers but every email address youve ever replied to assuming you never turned off the option to add addresses you replied to in gmail to your address book which really makes gmail contacts a mess.The easiest workaround for me was to set up starred contacts in gmail which comprises only people I want in my phone numbers list on my phone.  The dialercontacts list has a section for only starred contacts.  If you add a number on your phone to your contacts list just star that person when you add it on your phone it will get syncd to your Google contacts during the next sync.

Until the phone is torn down you dont have an easy solution since the battery cant just be swapped since it requires a T Torx bit.

I had issues with my connection  dropped packets ms ping and called ATampT and they said it was because i was not using one of their handsets.  So  I picked up one of the hotspots.. and the same deal.  So I returned the hotspot and got a VZW mifi and all is good.  I think ATampTs network is just weak in some areas.

8722758,0,t3_4zgwc4,For starters everything made up of multiple components is worth less all together than the sum of all components separate. In some cases one component in unused condition will be worth more than the whole thing together lightly used. My laptops battery is worth more than my laptop for example.The Nexus  price on its own being low is a combination of relatively low demand I feel saddened by how many articles call it a failure or wont shut up about it being too big and the Ps success. For the most part people think why get a  when I can get a P? The reason the replacement display assembly is so costly is because replacing just one of the three components AMOLED digitizer glass on its own is a tremendous pain in the ass so youre looking at a convenience fee on top of the cost of the parts.,nexus6,d6vzhwb,2,t5_2vo75

10913084,0,t1_de5ee3f,The OEM cable has been lost for quite a while and the OEM AC Turbo charger was damaged by water as well. I was using the Vivitar brand USB cables which are the cheapest cables at Walmart but they were the only ones that worked.  But they only lasted a few days or weeks. I was using a Samsung turbo charger and it worked perfect and fast.  At this point I am using basic wireless chargers but they are so slow compared to the ac turbo plug in.  Ive used high quality cables as well with no luck. Many of the cables stopped working altogether. Thankfully it can be charged wirelessly tho.,nexus6,de5lv97,1,t5_2vo75
