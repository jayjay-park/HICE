5013229,0,t1_cuq9xw0,I really like the idea of different ammo types. The game could have Armor Piercing Hollow Points and maybe even P for pistols and SMGs or some sort of hand loads.It would definitely make the game tactically deeper what with knowing to use AP against armored security and robots hollow points against gangbangers and all of that.Honestly I know the story and characters are what most people play the Shadowrun games for but I really think theyll eventually need to deepen the combat specially regarding guns and by a lot.,shadowrunreturns,cuqa7t6,1,t5_2tuhr

6117956,0,t1_cykhcxx,Yeah Dead Mans Switch campaign gave about  karma. Dragonfall campaign peaks at about .  If you really want to pass the most skill checks go with Intelligence  Decking  Rigging.   in Charisma with Etiquette Security and  others of your choice.   in Conjuring to unlock Astral Sight is enough.  Ignore Quickness zero skill checks here  Ignore Strength just bring EigerGlory along and other options that include Strength generally gives you minor stuff that you would have gotten through other methods  Ignore Willpower same here with Strength nothing importantDragonfall is designed such that you cannot experience all content unless you cheat by adding karma.

10141791,0,t1_dbtfob5,My solution is more pointing out the fact that humans have a natural tendency to be racist... or more accurately as others pointed out humans have a natural tendency to hate anything thats not sufficiently ingroup enough.Note your qualifiers reportedly expressed. They are the flimsy excuses people drum up to justify their hatred.Note how the Irish are now accepted and much less hated. Why? Because they eventually stopped being different and became more like us. Sentiment towards LGBT people is growing more positive... why? Because theyre increasingly being seen as more like us. Etc.The real reason why there arent hate groups for Canadians in the US is because white members of Canadian or other Western culture are seen as close enough to not trigger the different from us instinct as strongly. But black Canadians or Canadians of other races would not get as friendly a reaction and over in the UK you see things like Eastern Europeans being triggered as too other in a way that would be less likely here in the US because generally the Polish and Greeks and so on have already overcome their other status here to assimilate enough to become just like us.I strongly suspect that eventually the more whitepassing Hispanics will become just like us this has already happened to a certain extent with CubanAmericans. But darker skin colors continue to be seen as a hardtoovercome barrier for people willing to give into their tribal tendencies.And now imagine there suddenly being new races with even more extreme differences in phenotypes and sometimes even magical powers and it really doesnt take even flimsy excuses for people to start up the usual bigotry trends.,shadowrunreturns,dbtha3q,7,t5_2tuhr

10355245,0,t1_dchtevs,Wiz. I know its in description. The problem is that the description of cyberware weapons requirments spread all over the freaking skills one in cyberweapons affinity one in melee combat another one emphasis on one in ranged combat. Its messy. I did not noticed that at first.gtIts supposed to give Marksmen a way to do melee damage. A bit OP dont you think? Or at least to much attention for already powerful combat option especially if someone prefers rifles. Then there is that superhandy arm that reloads your ammo so you can reload while shooting which at the same time makes pistol less as viable option because that  skill talent advantage is neglected by cyberware but powersup every other ranged option especially Rifles. Where on the other side we have melee range fighters who simply got ZERO ranged options without investing karma in some other trees. You can try throw grenades ofcourse but they cost money which are already scarce and needed elsewhere and without some investment in throwing weapons your aim suck because in close range you got your melee swordsfistsspursetc. option i mean sure going in melee and using AP grenade is nice tactic but thats not what i am talking about.gt I do assume it is the same as swords vs axes? Didnt try so far but I know Throwing to be bugged  is there an issue with the Razors AP dmg?You see thats the problem. I cant remember when my runner actually did AP damage with normal attacks using her claws because most of the time i spend all action points on AP damaging special attacks while other team members finishing them off or doing severe damage or using flashbangs if i needed AP attacks. Apart from that the point is  its too random and unpredictable and trading it with  Bleeding Points which are not working on everything btw to flat  DMG and  Armour Piercing seems like not a fair trade.,shadowrunreturns,dchtsnx,2,t5_2tuhr

Rifle damage has been nerfed significantly for HK. Perhaps it balances out so Rifles are back to being just as OP as they were in DF P  While I am not too sure as to why theyd possibly want to nerf Pistols in its early levels it may simply not be a nerf. To not need an expensive piece of chrome is pretty valuable. Also there are loads of good arms to use instead. Currently I play Strength based and want Str arms yet the Jolt will be sorely missed gtWhere on the other side we have melee range fighters who simply got ZERO ranged optionsNot true Throwing is awesome! It works as two skills in one  you use Throwing where guns use Ranged Combat and a weapon skill. Ofc Melees already have Strength but no Quickness so Throwing triples the karma effectiveness of guns.  Karma are your ticket Throwing   even  Karma may do Throwing  for the pin needs toHit buff. Especially the pinning attack is extremely strong if used well. Thrown flushes from cover and allows moving and attacking with  AP just like melee. Also thrown weapons are cheap which is a major factor in HK not counting grenades. The Shurikens Str   damage is pretty competitive especially early on. Throwing unlocks overwatch although it doesnt say so in the description. Im halfway through my first Solo playthrough and Throwing Weapons are my only offense ...so far I intend to double in Close Combat with cyber weapons. Alas! Throwing doesnt go well with Chi Adepts due to the Karma costs.   Besides spoiler! kill the Mummy and you get a sword with a ranged attack if at a cooldown. ,shadowrunreturns,dcicsww,2,t5_2tuhr
