4505354,0,t3_3csozi,I made a Crystal deck I love crystals! but I doubt it would work all that well. I need to test it and fix whatever weaknesses it has.The Crystal Hyrens art is one of my favourites.I really like the Rumble Stoness ability I think it should be essential to many Underneath decks so they have more strength against swarms besides the expensive Ormagon.,MagiNation,csyjtt7,2,t5_2xc9v
4510974,0,t1_csyyua9,So far two from Blue Furok are joining I will mediate they dont care for Reddit. I shall put my bet of  on FrostyNinja he knows a LOT about MND and he even created an infinite energy deck piling energy on a Wudge that he did successfully pull off in a game.Lets see what happens.

4614052,0,t1_ctc6e6m,I was planning on keeping a running ranking based on tournament results assuming we do more tournaments. Thats how it worked when there were official tournaments.,MagiNation,ctc6jk6,2,t5_2xc9v
4616126,0,t3_3e8bje,Interesting. Like you Ive never really played around with Paradwyn and I never even considered that Dreamwarps might or might not stack. That said I would assume they do not stack that the effect applies only to the card as it is being played and then becomes a dormant effect.,MagiNation,ctcfwqp,2,t5_2xc9v
4641786,0,t1_ctfk91g,You never see cards reference cards a Magi controls its always player controls. Based on that I would say you can still use cards that are in play from a previous Magi. If it wasnt that way Interchange decks would suck.,MagiNation,ctfnw6c,2,t5_2xc9v
4669896,0,t1_ctj6a3q,Thats what I was thinking too.When Technomagus and I had our match there were two other people online with names Ive never seen before. I wonder if they were who youre talking about. Theres definitely interest in MND at least and hopefully the community will interest these interested people.I do admit I love some games and things but rarely if ever do I  participate in their communities.,MagiNation,ctj6yf1,2,t5_2xc9v

5077376,0,t3_3kjarl,One of the best relics in the entire game for a region thats already very energy efficient and one of very few ways to stop a devastate. Relic removal is not too common especially in region locked formats.,MagiNation,cuy0kna,3,t5_2xc9v

5558936,0,t3_3r8315,The way I see it is that to get most use out of Ahron youd have to be swarming small creatures. If I have a bunch of Uban Venger and Izmer attacking becomes a hugely detrimental for my opponent. The problem is that these creatures will be easy to get rid of without attacking. Thoughts? ,MagiNation,cwm4xvy,3,t5_2xc9v

7443290,0,t3_4h85j5,I like it on the whole. Looks better than any of my old experiments with Rock Yajo.Im not  sold on Kazm as the last magi though. Hunter is fun but as youve got  Auraflections as well as  Unearths it seems like having someone with a good power might be better. Celebrated Hero or Groll the Fallen off the top of my head.Some Dream Balms and maybe an Emecs Forge might not go amiss either. Even with Shards of the Great Fossil and Vertigo your creatures are going to sustain some damage. Especially if you do stick with Kazm as your opponent might try leaving one of your creatures with only a few energy to get around Hunter.,MagiNation,d2o96ge,5,t5_2xc9v
8011857,0,t1_d4fllts,Im guessing its this shirt I couldnt find a better picture online I can upload one at home. I have two of these. There were a bunch of other available shirts from their shop but I havent seen a single one yet.Is it a Cald deck? League Elder is brutal if hes not defeated quickly.,MagiNation,d4glvfd,2,t5_2xc9v
8242294,0,t1_d57i9tv,For Nar it would go a little backwards. It needs work so we can make a reason for that in the lore theyve been away from everyone else for too long until their trek to Naroom to help them. They realize some training or power development is required. In come new Spells and Relics. Maybe discover a new Creature or maybe Magi can change or refine their abilities. Maybe since theyve traveled away from their element their starting energies rise while their growth remains high at least relatively. Lots of possibilities there if we need excuses in the lore. xDI remember you saying something about the LotR set. Perhaps we can make some fun sets like that for unique abilities that we feel dont belong with the existing regions.,MagiNation,d57uc0v,2,t5_2xc9v
8378858,0,t1_d5oh8bs,Okay heres a quick summary of useful informationThere are  different card colors theyre all regions. Arderial Bograth Cald etc. Sky swamp fire etc. Blue Furok is a great source for seeing what cards you have and you can tell which regions is which by looking at the different sets and names.I dont recommend logging all the commons and uncommons if you havent finished doing that already most people only log rares and foils and the rest are separated by region and set. As said by someone else the Awakening and Dreams End sets are the rarest.When you finish making the list of rares and foils let us know we can help determine the costs and maybe youll have some cards some of us are looking for. Give us general guesses at how many of commons and uncommons you have separated by region and set. You can group the commons and uncommons together. For example  Cald base set LimitedUnlimited wont matter  Cald Awakening  Cald Dreams End  Cald Nightmares Dawn etc.If you prefer to use the colors instead of the regions thats fine.,MagiNation,d5owmot,2,t5_2xc9v
8382703,0,t3_4ug0n1,You can find the update.txt and a brief guide here  Its not a true update as in its not going to update the plugin you already have its technically a whole new plugin. You can switch between them freely and even port your decks from the old one to this one instructions in the guide. What this adds is the Unreleased Promos and Moga Boots which was left out of the original plugin weve been using.  Over the next few weeks Ill be adding Daybreak. ,MagiNation,d5pdwqy,4,t5_2xc9v

10950253,0,t3_5wdcbp,From my experience the only foil promos that exist are gia eidon korg zet and tony jones. These are the  promos that were released in  and are all main characters in the video game.,MagiNation,de9fvyi,3,t5_2xc9v
10951147,0,t1_de9j15c,Yes there is no choice in the matter. It says  Once per opposing turn as energy is removed from one of your Creatures add an additional amount of energy to your Magi.  This means that ANYTHING that removes energy from a Creature be it Effect Power Spell or Attack whichever happens first and no matter how much energy the action removes be it  or  activates the bracelet. Control of the relic is entirely out of its owners hand which I would argue makes it a rather shitty card. ,MagiNation,de9j7eg,3,t5_2xc9v
10959608,0,t3_5wcx43,I would definitely be interested in a printed only tournament whether with the restricted list or otherwise. I will have my cards on me regardless. ,MagiNation,deaemim,4,t5_2xc9v
11147570,0,t3_5z3jld,If youve got unlimited cards then base set has some of the bestinbreed removal spells  Thunderquake and Shockwave. Other than that each of the core five has a pretty clearly defined theme and not a huge pool of available options.,MagiNation,devkcu0,4,t5_2xc9v
