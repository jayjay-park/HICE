1464114,0,t1_cizg7ai,you should feel ecstatic tbh dead srs SVGs doing what Dumars should have done last year. Say fuck the bigish names and go after players who can actually play in an NBA offense and fit around DrumMonroe .....and..... Smith.Needed shooters got shooters. Now watching SmithJennings chuck wont be as painful as last year still be painful.If Pistons keep Mooses deal cheap this offseason is a win tbh. Even if it is market value probably will or slightly over market it would still be just as good.,nbadimensions,cizswd7,1,t5_32e2s
