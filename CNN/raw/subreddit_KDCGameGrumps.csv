Its all about what youre trying to do I supposeEDIT On that same note you could just make an XGamesesque megaramp to use a downslope to reach max speed and then ramp off from there maybe even with an airvent to reach maximum ups!,KDCGameGrumps,cpa0xxn,2,t5_37bgp
3372569,0,t3_2yt5id,One thing to consider is that we are making this for the grumps P Id like to see some proper powerup placement but Id say try to make sure the powerup is helpful but not necessary to beat the course.,KDCGameGrumps,cpcp4pc,3,t5_37bgp
3396894,0,t3_2z4093,Its called VC Injection. Basically a Virtual Console game is an SNES rom packaged into a miniemulator sometimes different emulators depending on the type of SNES game and sometimes you can swap a rom with another one from a .wad file.I dont know too much about it but if you have a normal KDC wad I would think it to be very easy to inject a modified KDC into it. Should run just fine!Ive never done it myself though but Googling VC Injection might give you the information you need.,KDCGameGrumps,cpfh0dz,2,t5_37bgp

7811568,0,t3_4m5gd1,oops!!! I somehow didnt realize that there is more memory per page than there is text actually displayed on screen. Ill find a way around it though by using that extra space I guess and probably removing peoples real names,KDCGameGrumps,d3u32f0,3,t5_37bgp
