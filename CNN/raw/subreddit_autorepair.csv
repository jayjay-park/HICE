Many many things would have to go terribly wrong for you to get oil onto the spark plugs to the point where the engine would stall.  The engine wouldnt even run if those things happened.  With just that information Im siding with the kwik change place.  I dont understand what your mechanic charged you for other than an intake cleaning and a spark plug change.  Those things wouldnt have been caused by just doing an oil change even if they overfilled the oil.  They would have needed to put  gallons of oil into your engine before it would do what they are suggesting.  At that point youd notice a SEVERE lack of power a horrible shake at any engine speed and the possibility that it wouldt even idle.

Always get a nd opinion from another shop unless you have a really good reason to trust this one. Its currently driveable so you can easily take it to a couple places to get more opinionsprices and if you tell the current guy that youre going to shop around for a bit chances are theyll give you a better deal or throw in some extras. . Youve already replaced a lot of the more expensive things so you probably have a decently reliable vehicle right now.  . It sounds like you want to keep the vehicle for a while so investing a little more money into it probably isnt a bad thing.  Nissans are decent vehicles and should last quite a while. . What do they charge to flush the system? by the time you add that to the  youll probably be at least  so for another  you can get a full replacement which wont cost you anything for the next  years probably a decent investment. .

10319840,0,t3_5nqv1h,Ok first of all understand that when you take it to AutoZone to have the codes pulled thats not a diagnosis. Any given code may come with a definitionsay P O Sensor LowOut Of Rangebut that doesnt mean your  sensor is bad. It means the circuit that the sensor is on has a fault. This is where a shop or dealership diagnosis comes in. That whole circuit has to be tested which sometimes involves removing trim or disassembling wire harnesses to inspect connectors electrical terminals ground connections or even frayed or chewed up wire. Scanning for codes is only the st step. A broken wire or a loose ground could be the fault and the sensor could be fine. It just depends. Codes are tied to systems not  single parts. It seems to me whatever shop youre taking this to is just shotgunning it and guessing at parts to replace. Are you taking it to the same shop every time? If so it sounds to me like its a misdiagnosis and they need to eat the cost of any further diagnosis and work with you on cost for repair of that. My money is on water getting into some component or cold causing that component to change in some way and causing your issue. Hope this helps.,autorepair,dcdt6rb,2,t5_2rec7

10875900,0,t3_5vejra,I think I understand you in that your seeking advice from techs or shops on doing your own repair or diagnostics.  Thats kinda a tough one for guys in shops. There are several things working against you.  Management or owners want and need to keep everything moving at a fast pace with as little intruption or openings for mad customerspublic as well as constantly dealing with tons of instant issues that show up every day.  I know as a tech there are guys I can ask things there are guys I can actually get to physically help me and there are guys that I know not to even bother asking.  Also most techs are paid on a flat rate system.  So if the book says  hour to fix thats what they get paid. sometimes the shop takes some deductions from that. So if they are not efficiently working in that thing they will not only set themselves and the shop behind but will actually be loosing money. On the flip side the faster they get it done they can get that hour pay and move on to the next job making more money.  No one of us shops or techs could survive if we took the whole book time because there is so many little things we always have to do that are not included and get eaten up.  Plus the  hourly rate figures in there as well. So many times they may not be trying to be rude they just want and need to get as much as they possibly can get done and go home exhausted to do it again tomorrow.  Advice. Find some people that are not at work that love cars and love to tinker or do side work and try and get them to sort of mentor you or at least let you learn from them.   You may find someone who would enjoy the company or help you can provide while you learn.   Also a votech or college continuing education class may be worth a check out. ,autorepair,de1rsfy,2,t5_2rec7
