3587,0,t3_1u3dho,December was a fantastic month to finish off my first real year of board gaming. Kickstarters Christmas presents and an extended visit from my girlfriend to play all the games!Wits amp Wagers  A great trivia game where you dont need to know the answers to still be able to win! Never again should a group play a trivia game where people who arent answering a question sit around bored.Compounded  An interesting premise for a game but man this one felt so dry. Maybe I just didnt get it.SmileyFace  Worth the  I paid for it on Black Friday as it can play up to eight players with a fair amount of interaction. Doubt itll ever hit the table again though.Coup  This would be the game of the month if not for Tales. It plays well from three to ten with the Kickstarter version and is just fantastic. The art is gorgeous and the game play is great if you like The Resistance. I played this a dozen times this month. Days  A fun holiday trick taking game just begging to be played at Christmas time. Too bad itll probably never get played outside the month of December.Silent But Deadly Night  One of the Bmovie games and totally not my thing. I could see it being great for the right crowd though.Murder of Crows  Another short card game brought out when we needed something lighter. A lot of take that and it seemed like a good part of winning was left to chance. The art on the cards is pretty sweet though.Qwixx  A very neat little dice game that deserves wider release. Try it out if you get the chance!Coin Age  A fantastic little area control microgame that Im looking forward to receiving from Kickstarter in . Tried out the print and play while waiting around with my girlfriend and discovered a surprising amount of strategy.Libertalia  I was not a fan of this game at all. Its a neat idea but I think it gets so fiddly towards the end with the multiple discard piles. What could be very cool bluffing instead feels like chance a lot of the time.Mice and Mystics  While it has adorable art and minis this game just didnt do anything for me. It feels like most of the time theres a right and a wrong move and so the game really plays itself since combat comes down to dice rolls.Basari  No RatingFound this at a thrift store for  and tried it out but didnt finish the game due to one player not liking the genre of game and only realizing that after we started. I think thisll be a popular filler game among my regular crowd.Martinique  Another Black Friday grab to play with my girlfriend who wrote her senior thesis on pirates just this fall. Its a very interesting game but it suffers from feeling like two different games in the two phases  an exploration and set collection game and a little deduction minigame. I almost want to house rule the game to ignore the actual treasure and just explore the map and collect treasures.Tales of the Arabian Nights   Game of the MonthThe diamond in the rough. The gem of the Crystal Palace. A true masterpiece of game design. The only thing that breaks my heart about this game is that it was my gift to my girlfriend for Christmas so in four days it goes home with her! We started playing this about PM on New Years Eve and played multiple games well into the new year. I can guarantee it will hit the table again before she leaves since we actually left it out on the dining room table. My favorite game of the year should be no surprise InnovationIve played it  times this year eclipsed in plays only by Mahjong and The Resistance. It is my favorite game of the year because I can get it to the table regularly and it always plays differently. Im looking forward to getting the two existing expansions before too long although even just the base game is great. I dont know that I could play any other game in my collection  times and be able to pull something unique out every time as I expect to with Innovation.,boardgames,ceeugvs,1,t5_2qmjp

47464,0,t1_cejtjf4,Well thats ok typically new people have only played games like Monopoly and LIFE. Now those games are often criticized for the roll and move mechanic and lack of choice and decisions making. Modern games typically focus on making interestingtough decisions.Now finding a game that plays well with  people AND  is a challenge. Luckily the games you are interested in as inferred from your love of Talisman and GoW boardgames can fit that bill more easily. These games are called dungeoncrawlers and fall under a general category of ameritrash old derogatory name that stuck wear it proud. Ameritrash games love dice rolling randomness and deep theme rather than tight mechanics.While not applicable for  actually only good for  exactly in my opinion Battlestar Galactica would be great grab for you. This game is lauded for its great use of mechanics married to theme and is a great narrative. A lot of fun.You may want to check out other adventure games like Mage Knight or Pathfinder Adventure Card Game and Sentinels of the Multiverse.You may also want to check out the other broad category of eurogame just to get a feel for the kinds of games out there. These include Puerto Rico and Agricola.You should also check out common gateway games like Ticket to Ride Settlers of Catan Stone Age  Wonders and Dominion and gateway coops like Forbidden Desert Pandemic and Flash Point Fire Rescue.This is probably a lot to take in but welcome to the wonderful world of boardgames.

This should give you a better picture of the most well received games on BGG. Its not perfect but no search will turn up a perfect list. The Geek Ratings on BGG use a modified version of the Average Rating which is the total of the added up user ratings divided by the total number of ratings. The Geek Rating which is how the BGG Rank is generated uses an algorithm which adds a number of fake dummy ratings to games that have low numbers of ratings and uses a median number assumed to be around . for those ratings. This means a game that has three votes and each one rates it a  cant show up at the top of the BGG list because it also has  other dummy votes ranking it ..

88394,0,t3_1v414k,Ive never lost friends over board games but Ive had some close calls.Our group wasnt aware how extremely powerful Australia would be when we played our board of Risk Legacy. We played probably  games in quick succession and every single time my brothers roommate Donovan won in Australia extremely easily. I yelled a bit and I distinctly remember saying stuff like This is so disproportionate to how powerful Australia is in normal Risk and We need to play a game of normal Risk this is absolute bullshit theres no way youd win every time.I apologized not even  minutes later for raising my voice while we played some MtG but it was definitely the most heated I have gotten from a game.About a year ago I played Monopoly with my girlfriend and her brother and sister. Everything was going alright I was losing because my dice rolls kept only landing me in places already bought but I was happy enough to not be playing Cards Against Humanity... again... But we were playing with a house rule where money goes into the middle and free parking gets you a jackpot. Anyways my girlfriend rolled doubles on her last roll to get out of jail so she didnt have to pay and it was s so she got the free parking too. Later on her sister got a  and  on her second roll and said that she should be able to choose to pay to get out and use the  and  as her roll to land on the jackpot... She stormed off after my girlfriend told her that she absolutely could not do that.Funniest thing to me was that I was so oblivious to their tone that I didnt realize my girlfriends sister was mad I thought she was just joking around.

Ds Ds Ds etc.. The only game I can think of that uses nontraditional dice and is in my collection is Pathfinder ACG.I have no idea why these are underrepresented. I think I feel miniature games are more about the miniatures than the depth of play. I played war hammer k in its early years and the game itself never really drew me in. I am interested in picking up Mice and Mystics and Omega  but the vast majority of miniature games like Hero Clicks and Descent just dont interest me.As for the dice I stopped playing roleplaying games many years ago and thats where most nonsix sided dice are used.,boardgames,ceonpns,6,t5_2qmjp
90023,0,t1_ceolf78,Well! Id love to. Battle Line is one of my all time favorites.So like lost cities Battle Line has you playing on both sides of well a line. This time it is  flags rather than  destinations or whatever they are in lost cities. The difference here is you are playing formations cards in a run  of a kind  of a color etc. on either side of every flag. There is no required order you need to play in what you are trying to do is build better formations on your side of the flags. So if your opponent has  of a kind you can beat it with a run of  cards of the same color etc. The rules have a hierarchy of hands. These formations can be built at any time over the course of the game assuming the card you need to win the flag is still available. When both players have  card formations or the card you need to beat your opponent is already on the board meaning there is no way to finish the formation the better formation or more points in case of the same formation is better and that player wins the flag. Winning  flags in a row or a total of  flags wins the game. Thats all well and good but the game takes another step and includes  tactics cards. You can draw a tactic card instead of the numbered cards to steal cards play wildcards or change the victory conditions of a flag. Each player can only use  more of these than their opponent but they add in some very nice wrinkles.This game beats lost cities for a few reasons Getting the right cards first has no innate advantage it can be good and it can be bad. Scoring is not stupid. Flags are scored individually and immediately you can even strategically play cards to force scoring on a flag that your opponent is stalling on. High numbers are great but not everything you can win this game by playing strategically not just relying on the right card pickups. Tactics cards blow the game open and introduce interaction and some interesting twists and turns.Hopefully I did it justice there I enjoy the game quite a bit and so does my wife. We probably have  plays of the game logged and it still hits the table quite often.,boardgames,ceoof0m,2,t5_2qmjp

126684,0,t3_1vjbsq,Carcassone is good for  players but it is a fairly simple game. Thats not a bad thing but it and Agricola are on completely different wavelengths in regards to complexity. So it kind of depends on what you are looking for.Catan is a must have for the collection imo but it is awful for  players OK with  players and best with  players.Agricola is a fantastic game but I think it plays best with  players. I havent played it but Ive heard that the  player only implementation Agricola All Creatures Big and Small is good.Race for the Galaxy is a fun card game that is fairly simple once you grasp the concepticons yet still offers plenty of room for strategy plays well with  and also plays well with  but its somewhat lacking in the component compartment cards only and the theme is existent but not very immersive. You should check a video out. Castles of Burgundy is a good medium weight euro game. It plays really well with  and up to . Once again though components are good but nothing to write home about and the theme is nothing special. Ticket to Ride is another must have for any collection imo. I prefer the Europe version due to some of the complexities and strategy it adds compared to the USA version. The components are pretty nice and the theme is actually pretty good for a euro game. The base game will play OK with  players but if you want to make it really good you should pick up a mappack. I would recommend SwitzerlandIndia  sided map expansion as my wife and I really enjoy Switzerland  player.Stone Age is a good eurostyle introduction to worker placement games and plays well with . Components are good wooden meeples and resources theme is OK.If you havent noticed a trend here typically euro games at least the classics and most highly rated euro games dont tend to have the most exciting or immersive theme. Some more euro style games that I havent played but I think will fit your requirements and generally are well received Keyflower Le Havre Suburbia if you can find it CitadelsSorry this got longer than I had planned...Lastly if you havent heard of Rahdo Runs Through you should check his videos out. He plays mostly euro strategy games that play  players but he rates them primarily on how they play with  players since thats how he plays most games with his wife. He also sets up the game and runs through  turns from both players perspectives o you can get a really good idea of some of the strategy involved and see the game in action.

138634,0,t3_1vo8bq,My younger brother visited last week on leave from the Navy he is into video games so I thought he would dive right into boardgames.   Mmmm not so much.Legendary this was the first game he played and he had trouble grasping how to play the cards although he was fine with deckbuilding.  The theme appealed but he thought it ended too quickly.  Overall men.Twilight Struggle  he is a huge into history like me so I thought he would love this game as much as I do nope.  He felt it moved too slow and was frustrated by the competition with me.  Now dont get me wrong I was not playing to win tension  older brother  irritability.  We didnt finish.Flashpoint Fire Rescue  after a disappointing TS he only wanted to play Coops and this one is easiest to teach he also received fire training on a sub so it is also a theme we both share IRL.  He was CAFS and he played well we won pretty handily.  He enjoyed this one a little bit more than Legendary.The Resistance  He absolutely loved this game and ended up purchasing his own copy for when he is underway.  We played multiple games and he couldnt get enough of the hidden traitor mechanic.  Battlestar Galactica is the next logical step after Resistance so...  Did we finally lock it down?  This was his Xmas gift to me and I have not played it yet we set everything up and went over the rules.  We were all ready when our new baby became fussy an hour later we started.  He was a Cylon from the start and and got really into the role it got late so we called the game but set it up again  nights later.  Next game went off without a hitch with my wife and umikesoss being frakking toasters.  I was Admiral Tigh and eventually President Tight I weilded the threat of the brig like an Axe ready to fall.  A super close end game and some lucky jumps gave the humans a victory.  This game is absolutely amazing and one of my favorites.  As a bonus my brother loved it and got him into the show.Eldritch Horror We played against YogSothoth with  investigators.  We squeaked to a victory with  left on the Doom Track as we danced around the table.  Then someone pointed out we forgot to decrease it when an investigator went insane drat!  We ended up losing but it was fun a great time as usual.  Brother dug the encounters and flavor text.Android Netrunner  Got one game in with the wife after reading uSigma short story I scored Posted Bounty then played Scorched Earth for the win as tribute to the story.Edited for questions  If there is a large group playing I prefer to just play in the large group.  Its not often we can bring out a large party game so if we have the people then awesome!  That being said I generally prefer to have a smaller group of  it lets us play the bulk of our games without to much distraction.As far as thinky games I guess I will go with Twilight Struggle I stare at that board and my cards and that little hamster in my head is running his little legs off in that wheel of his.,boardgames,ceu7xxr,2,t5_2qmjp

150728,0,t1_cevkwvx,First thanks for the feedback appreciated.  Quality cards are definitely achievable.  There are a number of options for custom printing of pokergrade cards and chips with high resolution custom graphics.  Its probably also worth offering the option of cheap cardstock cards if budget is a concern.  I was also planning to have a bunch of plastic gem  metal coin  general plastic doodad options available as game counters for people who prefer more physicality in their counters but dont want to pay to D print a custom object.    Custom dice graphics would be easy enough for ds but for anything else youd pretty much need to D print it.  Hmm.  I could probably build a utility for generating those d models though.  Something to think about.     Custom cut board pieces is probably beyond the scope of what I can achieve without actually buying a CampC workshop which would dramatically increase startup costs.  Maybe shelve that one as an extension later.  As far as the D model thing goes Ive worked with D printers before and theyre unreasonably finnicky so I was planning to outsource the actual printing to a bulk fabrication outfit who generally have fairly nice printers with good resolution and high grade ABS.  As far as price goes I was planning to have a floating price in the web app to show you how each addition impacts the final unit price with an itemizes breakdown of what youre buying.  That satisfactory?   The software tools is a good idea.  Being able to generate branded gamespecific apps for certain applications is clever and would be both useful and easy to do.  Custom printed boxes is definitely doable. ,boardgames,cevlkl0,1,t5_2qmjp

Random. Its a deck building game with an area control and hidden agenda component. Its kind of a neat mix and then The scoring aspect is kind of interesting which is that at first you dont know whose side you are on and of the two sides no one from the losing side may win. So mostly you want to hide what side youre on as long as you can and hope your secret teammates will take the global actions that benefit your side so you can focus on winning.

However even as streamlined as it is Eldritch Horror is stretching the definition of mediumweight game pretty far most games take over  hours.Finally from my own experience at least the DC Comics Deckbuilding Game makes an excellent introduction to deckbuilding games. It suffers a bit from being too lightweight  theres not much strategy at all and the randomness of the decks can wear on you after a while since all games tend to feel the same. But its flaws are the very things that more indepth deckbuilders see Dominion introduce so as a gateway game it works well.,boardgames,cext5yy,1,t5_2qmjp

171642,0,t3_1w1xvv,WATCH OUT!!! Classic cylon newbie mistake is to contribute a color card to a crisis that no one else is using.  For example if someone who is secretly a cylon is playing the only pilot in the game it is very easy to be ousted by placing more than  red cards onto a crisis.  Even with just one if the random  cards put in are also red it looks highly suspicious.  Its been a while but I do believe certain locations and cards allows a player to draw outside of their normal colors.  For a first play through though it is far more likely that someone is going to play too many pilot cards and be deemed a cylon super early into the game. I felt horrible for my friend who did this when we played with my group.I love this game im fairly certain its my favorite game.

Fun fact subtracting  from the defenders highest die ammo shortage k k k is LESS effective than subtracting  from their lowest Enclave ability k k k. Will I ever pull it out in a game? probably not but having run a number of scenarios it feels less chaotic now that I know that I need at least double the defenders as attackers when assaulting a DM HQ.The game is amazing in its own right but the are a lot of variables that can overlap and change something from what was a pseudosolved game to one that can seem random.

238549,1,t3_1wtpop,The problem is you dont know how to play games. First off Smash Up is about the fun of the theme. If youre not getting a kick out of Pirate Ninjas or Alien Dinosaurs or Bear Cavalry Ghosts youre already playing the wrong game. Second anyone who has ever complained you are not alone about the lack of ways to track basescoring or player points is obviously a nongamer.  The base totals change constantly with some minions being worth more on one players turn than the other. A basetracker will be wrong more often that its right as people forget to keep sliding it up and down. At the end of your turn add each base. If it takes more than a second for each base something is wrong.  And player score could easily be kept with pen and paper or using literally ANYTHING as a point token. The game is only played to . Do you really need little cardboard s and s instead of using pennies and nickels?  As for the handful of textheavy cards...yes you can have up to  cards with a line or two of text. This is true of any card game. Most civilized people will look through their decks and at least get to know their cards slightly before they start playing. Then for most factions you are only playing  cards and drawing  new cards per turn. And as with all games the more you play the more familiar you get with the game and the faster it becomes.  Third you only played twice but the factions seem pretty unbalanced.   In two plays you could have only seen each faction once. How do you know it wasnt a bad draw or inexperienced misplays instead of a balance issue?  You dont. Finally you say its all retentive anyway Im assuming you mean irrelevant? because when youre about to score a ninja can jump in and steal it.   Guess what! There are tons of ways to protect a basescore from a ninja.  You know your opponent is playing Ninjas you know he can sometimes slide an extra point minion on to a base  dont win a base by less than  points.  You know he can assassinate some of your minions. Take that into consideration before playing minions at will. So to answer your question...is there something wrong with you?  Yes. Yes there is definitely something wrong with you.  The main thing is probably your lack of conviction in your own taste of games leading you to ask permission to ebay a game you dont like and leading you to buy games that dont fit your style in the first place. ,boardgames,cf5h5ej,-2,t5_2qmjp

240003,0,t1_cf5i3xi,Assassin is one of the best roles but its not the right choice  of the time. Its still comparable to the other roles in power.A roles special action is generally equivalent to half your turn. You might get  gold from a Merchant or draw  and build a district from Architect.If you choose Assassin youre essentially giving up half your turn since you get no special ability beneficial to your own development for a  chance at denying your opponent a whole turn. It can be better if youre really good at guessing the opponents role or worse if youre opponent is good at fooling you! but the Assassins special ability is still roughly equivalent to the benefit of any other roles ability.Thats in P.

I also play it with my girlfriend because she really enjoys it and weve played  players a couple of time and I think it plays well with  or  players. Something that is much lighter you might like to consider is Kingdom Builder.  Its by the guy who made dominion and you place settlements on a map. It takes  minutes or less to play.  Its really really simple and easy to pick up.

244303,0,t3_1ww4ti, SaturdayThe ResistanceWe played this as our gaming group trickled in so we played three games   and player games. It was interesting watching the game evolve as the players increased especially as we hit seven players and more mission cards were played. The introduction of the cards that cause players to show or look at other players cards definitely helps what I thought was a lopsided advantage to the traitors in larger groups in the past we were playing incorrectly not increasing the amount of mission cards played with more players. We had loyalists win two out of the three games.True Colors and ScattergoriesNot much to say about these games they are light party game but I dont mind them every once and awhile. We played with the new version of Scattergories which had rules that were different than most of us remembered so we just mixed and matched the rules we wanted instead.Interesting is that we had a friend who joined us for all these games via Skype. Some games just wouldnt work for this setup but all these games we were able to make work.  SundaySunday consisted of five players.Shadows over CamelotAnother group of friends got together specifically to play Shadows with another who has wanted to try it. We played two games the first without the expansion the second with and also the Squire rule. Both games proved once again why Shadows is our groups favorite medium gameIn the first game we were doing pretty well on swords but suspected the winner of Lancelots Armor of being the traitor. Late in the game one knight played Clairvoyance to order the top five black cards in a way that would basically give the suspected traitor a lopsided choice. This late in the game the traitor of could took the worse of two evils which gave us the confidence we needed of our suspicion to plan out the rest of the game in victory. Most interesting in this game was the amount of strategy we used in the end got us to the point where we needed to use Excalibur to cancel the effects of a Pict placement!Our second game was the worst evil win ever handed to us. We experienced four straight special black cards including two that reduce life one immediately one when the next quest was lost. Our first travel card was Captured and the Traitor secretly discarded a badly needed Dispel. Basically everything went wrong and we lost due to all knights dying in about a half an hour after only a single white and black sword being placed.Space AlertWe played three games in the first game only normal threat cards were used and we won without taking a single damage token. The H.M.S. Fowler was destroyed in the next two missions once we mixed in advanced threats.The main takeaway that I learned T RedZone Slimes delay! If you get a Slime on T in the Red zone even if a player beelines for the lowerred zone your movement into the Red Zone will be delayed! If at all possible USE THE HEROIC ACTIONS TELEPORT to get into the zone on T and activate battlebots on T. If this is not possible you need to be ready for the delay.Other fun events from Space Alert In one of the missions that we died we pulled off an immaculate series of properly timed energy reloads and weapons firing. Unfortunately  of the weapons shot at empty space. During the chaos of trying to figure out what was happening with the internal threats and the communication outages I completely didnt put down any cards during the second phase during one of the games.Red Dragon InnWe played a few games of this with  players. We mixed up a bunch of sets but played with the Sea Events which I believe were from RDI and mostly characters from there. We also had a victory  from Erin the Ever Changing which seems to win the award for Character we most want to like but seldom ever come close to winning with. I think I did well with my Turtling strategy always ditch lesser action and gambling cards in favor of trying to draw more defensive or retaliatory cards. In the three games I won once was one of the final two that ended in a draw then was third after I was ganged up on. I played as Bryn the Boatswain for the first two the third as Gerki the Sneak.,boardgames,cf62olf,1,t5_2qmjp
244514,0,t1_cf61epn,I played a game of Avalon the other day where the player who was Merlin noticed that there were two traitors on the mission with him so he decided to play a fail so that even if the two traitors solved the prisoners dilemma there would be two fails on the table and everyone would know that there were two traitors on that mission. It was actually kind of brilliant though we were very confused at the time. We learned afterwards that it is explicitly against the rules for loyal players to fail a mission. Still I love the thinking behind the move.,boardgames,cf63gz3,3,t5_2qmjp

254040,0,t3_1ww4f8,TEK is a poor choice. Based on actually playing i think adding factions is rather easy to balance out. But youre right in general. Stretch goals go out of control sometimes. Even more crazy is backer gong nuts over stretch goals. I saw it over at Werewolf Deluxe Ed where backer complained on nearly every post I saw and constantly in the comments about what amountd to about  roles that had been discontinued and therefore were only being offered as Bonus roles with the art packs.Its scary and odd to see people complaining because a game with over  rolls just doesnt have more. I mean I was sad to not get the hoodlum at the time... we later unlocked those cards but I accepted it. We saw it over at TinyEpicKingdom with the cards. Some backer were really really really angry that the character cards would be compressed to a single card instead of two. The artwork is being retooled and baically theyre taking the characters and putting them ON TOP of the locations instead of having one card with each. I saw three backer complaining about the loss of art... loss because having the character on top blocks some of the landscape.In general though adding in balance shifting changes is an iffyt hing. its why I hate the idea of kickstarter exclusive changes. Projects like Coup can support more characters we see the same thing in Chaosmos. In a minor sense those sorts of changes can affect balance and I find that mildly frustrating,boardgames,cf733q0,1,t5_2qmjp
254086,0,t1_cf72c48,I found that when you play again with the same group there are a lot of callbacks to previous times playing. So you could steal a clue that was given for a card from a previous game and use it hoping that the person who used the clue originally remembers and chooses your card while at least  other person doesnt remember and doesnt choose your card. Or you could use a previous clue for a different card and try to throw off a bunch of players.I do think replayability with the exact same group is probably limited to about  plays without getting expansions. But I think a person could play the same game no expansions with different groups many times.,boardgames,cf739xl,1,t5_2qmjp

Heres what keeps me going there They have a membership program where they charge  US to be a member for a year. Being a member gives you  off all products and  off playing in store. They have a Game of the Week program where every week a certain game is  off for members and free to play in store. Playing in store usually costs . US per person per hour . for members.  They had a sale to celebrate  members where they sold membership for half off and every game they carried was  off for one weekend. This is how they got me in. For every  US you spend on games you get  free hours of gaming in store. If you ask them to bring in a board game they dont have in their library you get a discount on that game for referring them to a potentially good product.And dont forget the little things like They have a facebook page that they constantly update. Their email team is very responsive and helpful. Calling the store results in... well results. Staff remember your name inform the other staff that you called and what you called about and they follow up and respond to your issues. Their staff is polite there are many people working there so theyre not shorthanded during busy periods and will help teach you the games you want to play. They only start to time your play AFTER youve learned the rules and actually started playing the game so you dont feel pressured to just rush the rulebook because youre learning on the clock. Theyre also quite lenient about time Played for hrs m? nvm well just charge you for  hours. Well lit clean not dusty or manky tasteful decoration large windows.This is only the stuff Ive noticed from going there and being a customer. I have no idea how the business stuff is run on their end.The value I get from them as a customer They bring in any game I want in a country that Amazon does not ship to and online purchasing takes forever to arrive and at  off. They update on when stock arrives and email me to let me know when I can pick up my order. They have yet to screw up and I get the sense that if they do screw up they will apologize profusely and make it right. They are located in a place very convenient to me. In fact they have  branches and they will happily ship the games from one branch to another at my convenience at no extra cost. Free delivery anywhere in the country above US Excellent customer service. Extremely wide selection of games  facebook albums worth with a comprehensive price list that allows me to shop easily.

Through the Ages goes beyond normal board games in that it has probabilistic planning and personal elements that make it a lot like poker.  Its possible to play economically and win with big scores but the much more nuanced and often profitable play is to be aggressive keeping opponents off balance andor taking your resources through aggression instead of building.

When youre patient and considerate towards new people they will tend to be more open even if theyre initially indifferent or sometimes openly impatient. I cant count the number of times Ive felt like slapping people in their face when Im trying to teach a game and theyre still talking to each other on Facebook leaving halfway to pee or get a drink and then during the game claim they dont know what to do or why didnt you explain this earlier. But youve gotta suck it up and explain things sometimes two or three times. Then there are those people who just dont get it even if the games as simple as Ticket to Ride or Sushi Go. You cant assume everyone knows how to play intuitively or know how to score highly and these are THE trickiest to draw in because nobody likes to feel stupid especially in front of a group of people or worse strangers. Chances are if the game makes them feel stupid theyll blame the game as being stupid and everyone else who plays it by association. So patience again but dont explain like theyre five thats patronising which again makes people feel stupid. Find a way to explain rules that they can relate in real life for example drafting in Sushi Go is like choosing one itemthe best item! from a plate of sushi then passing the rest of the plate to your friend on the left. ,boardgames,cfcj517,37,t5_2qmjp

You have dice but theres no rolling for skills or checks or anything theyre only used for the setup and determining whether a scene ends well or poorly for the player which you saw in the Tabletop episode. Ive only really played half a game so far since we started playing at the end of the evening and after a whole bottle of wine or two  not an optimal situation for the game. If you have people that like roleplaying and arent really looking for a game you can win there isnt really a winstate in the game its loads of fun and can be as silly or serious as you want it to be.,boardgames,cfcoukt,5,t5_2qmjp

316869,0,t3_1xq0e2,You might really enjoy Tales of Arabian Nights. Its a different breed of game but shares a lot of the same fundamental traits that I at least enjoy in MampM. Its primary draw is a developing story in which you play the primary characters and you gather equipmentmodifiers to your character as you go.The difference is that Tales lacks the tactical aspects amp direct combat of Mice amp Mystics for the purposes of focusing more on the story. It is also certainly less complex as such and as an added bonus also manages to be arguably even more engaging as during a players turn their neighbors also participate in acting as storytellers. ,boardgames,cfdm2e4,1,t5_2qmjp

326699,0,t1_cfed8z6,Its not luck based. Yahtzee is luck based. Every turn in Carcassonne every possible place to place that tile is a separate and individual choice. As the game goes on there are a lot more choices. Also you play to keep your opponents from adding to their score. Maybe you shut down their road or make the building they are in harder to complete. These are all extra choices on top of choices that directly benefit you. I suspect you might be approaching it wrong especially if you think it is primarily luck based but its impossible to say otherwise. Maybe your not paying attention to what the other players are doing and just doing your own thing? Some people have house ruled drawing  tiles to reduce the one tile draw. But for me it isnt luck based compared to many games out there that clearly are. You draw then you have a ton of possible choices depending on the board size.,boardgames,cfemsrn,2,t5_2qmjp

The combat is done using cards and there are different things to consider do you play high combat value but no defense and risk losing several of your troops or do you think you can still win with a lesser combat value that has some defense so you dont lose guys.  On top of all that almost all of my games have been close which is great.As for games that are close to my top  but didnt quite make it I would probably put Eclipse LoTRLCG and Battlestar Galactica on that  list.

378477,0,t1_cfjzjxv,Id argue that its really unlikely that most games are balanced enough that going first doesnt matter. The reason it doesnt matter practically is because most people only play a game maybe half a dozen times.Obviously who goes first doesnt really matter in the short run. But if your procedure for choosing first isnt relatively random over a run of years its possible for a player to enjoy play nights more even if the game changes.I think it matters just enough to want to choose it randomly I dont see what just picking someone buys you unless the players are new enough that having an experienced player go first adds to the enjoyment. I chose those games because they were easy quick examples. Id bet that there arent many games for which going first does not convey an advantage.,boardgames,cfjztj3,3,t5_2qmjp

I much prefer this to the base game for  player.CarcassonneFinally played this with more than  players  to be exact and thoroughly enjoyed it. I managed to pull out a win as two other players canceled their farmers out on the largest field.TsuroGreat quick filler game.Zombie DicePlayed this while we were setting up Catan.QuirkleNot a huge fan of this but my partner LOVES this game and its better than scrabble so I deal.Star Trek CatanI love this game. I think the characters really spice up the regular game and can help you get out of binds and evens the field a little. My partner and I have actually gone out and bought the Helpers of Catan add on for my base game so we can play the same rules with  and  players. This was my worst game in a while but was nice to not dominate for once.PandemicWe did manage to win but we accidentally cheated at the beginning of the game by trading cards without being on the actual city we were trading. This helped us cure Blue on our first turn. I dont think we would have won if we didnt do this.Killer BunniesI thought I was loosing terribly but I managed to pull out a win by luck only had two carrots. Best moment of the game was when I played a Black Hole card and managed to kill  out of  bunnies on the table.AlhambraFavourite new game. I found it to have an awesome balance of its different mechanics and was a lot more about tile placement than I had originally thought.Ticket to Ride AfricaI was not a fan of this map at all. I do not like how the same colours are all bunched together. I will try it again though as I didnt notice the bunched colours when I selected my routes and ended up just needed white and black the entire game.Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards Duel at Mt.

In Infiltration everybody is trying to steal data files points from an evil corporation before the cops show up. The game is played somewhat simultaneously where everybody chooses an action card at the same time but will resolve them in player order. Its a game that will take a little over an hour to play maybe quicker if everyone is familiar with the game. There is a nice push your luck aspect to the game where the higher you go in this corporates building the more rewards you can get but it will be harder to escape. There is also a healthy dose of player screwage but none of it feels too bad or unfair. ,boardgames,cfo9a22,2,t5_2qmjp

427572,0,t1_cfp1icz,Agreed. Its a grey area. If a car reviewer reviews a car he test drives the car and it goes back to the companylot. If a newspaper foodie reviews a restaurant they pay for their own meal. Not sure why boardgame reviews are any different. Youd either send the review copy back or pay for it with your own money.    I dont know how the industry is currently setup I dont review games but I hope for the sake of being aboveboard one of the two options above is what happens.,boardgames,cfp302f,1,t5_2qmjp
428961,0,t1_cfodu9j,I tend to agree with you on most games.  My personal preference is to just start and learn as we go after a brief overview but with the understanding that this is a learning game.  The conflict occurs when people forget we decided to start and learn as we go then accuse the rules explainer of holding back information. It drives me crazy.Honestly the conflict usually arises because of some obscure scenario that no one would really explain beforehand anyway.  One of those situations where you need to reference the rulebook even if everyone already knows the game.  If you explained every weird scenario before you started the players would lose interest before the game got off the ground.  Cant win.,boardgames,cfp86gf,2,t5_2qmjp

Usually we manage to figure it out by then but Ive had some people in our group still be dissatisfied with the result. They bitch about it and then we dont play that game with them again. Its frustrating and I hate it but the pain of those shitty experiences has made me a better rules learner and game explainer. I can anticipate where there may be some issues and I try to provide things like player aids when I can. It also has made me prefer simple streamlined rule sets and avoid games with a billion rulebreaking cards and exceptions.,boardgames,cfq7v3n,4,t5_2qmjp

448223,0,t1_cfpkyii,Ive played Agricola and Bohnanza but Le Havre is actually my favorite of Uwes.  I mean I got the flair and everything.Its true theres no spatial element which I always like in a game... Princes of Florence is a good one for that too.  But Ive found Le Havre to be a unique kind of experience... the arc of the game is so long and so gradual even as the multitude of its possibilities seems to expand so dizzyingly as the session progresses.  I love the simplicity of its mechanics even as its choices allow for ever more intricate paths.  Its one of the rare heavy games that you can break out and get a newbie playing semicompetently within  minutes.  Yes a player needs several plays worth of familiarity with the buildings to really play at a  competitive level.  But the game is so gentle so friendly so ready to throw toogoodtoturndown possibilities at you that even a noncompetitive player will tap in to that paperclip gt house gratification. For me playing Le Havre is like floating down a gentle river on a summers day.  Around every bend is something pretty awesome.  If I miss one oh well something just as good or better is coming up soon.  Its like a glorious fantasy of only good things happening to everyone all the time.If I could live in a boardgame Id live in Le Havre.  If its on the table Im there.,boardgames,cfr81lh,3,t5_2qmjp

455453,0,t3_1zavjw,If you like Arkham Horror and want something more in that vein I have two suggestions for you Eldritch Horror This one is a lot like Arkham Horror except it takes place across the entire world.  Its for  players but can be difficult with more than five.  Its fixed a lot of the nitpicky rules from Arkham Horror and stream lined it a bit.  Its a cooperative game and has a good amount of replayability as there are different Old Ones and scenarios. Betrayal at House on the Hill My group loves this one.  Its best for  players and its also horror themed.  Its got tile laying and cooperative play.  Its basically a Bmovie horror movie in game form.  Id watch the Table Top with Wil Wheaton of this game to get a good feel of what it is.  But its one of our groups favorites.  There are I think  different scenarios and after playing  or so games we havent had any repeats so its good for playing a lot.,boardgames,cfs187i,5,t5_2qmjp

460036,0,t1_cfsgqep,Im going to have to counter your complaint about lack of strategy.Ive played the game  times now. The first  we lost due to seemingly random bad luck but each time we played we got better and better at the game. The last  games Ive been undefeated. Each time weve played the game has gotten faster. The first was  hours and then it came down to  and now we can play in  hours. Its a game that is simple to play but learning the strategy to be successful is much more difficult to master.There is a LOT of randomness in the game but the strategy is in learning how to tell what you should focus on when and deciding what options delay the inevitable long enough to win the game. Theres a lot to knowing when to work on a mystery and when to change your focus to the current rumor or to clear monsters and gates. There is a TON of strategy in moving across the board choosing when to spread out or clump up and work as a team or multiple teams. You need to know when its better to abandon a strategy you were going with to change focus on something else instead. If youre relying on the luck of the dice and the cards to be nice to you youre going to lose. The game uses randomness to provide an uncontrollable element that you have to work against and the design provides you the tools to overcome the randomness if you are playing well.As for substantive game mechanics Ill agree with you. The game mechanic is Roll X dice get a  or  for the entirety of the game. Read a card roll dice. That being said I honestly think that the elegance and simplicity of the game mechanics makes a game that is much more forgiving to new players and allows FFG to focus on the strategy and balance of the game which is something that was impossible to do with some of their other games that use a similar formula Arkham Horror Battlestar GalacticaI reject the notion that a game needs substantive game mechanics to be good or that the length of time the game takes to play has an affect on how substantive the game mechanics need to be. Some of BGGs top  games have extremely simple and repetitive game mechanics. Its a very elitist idea that a  hour game can only be fun if you have a dozen interworking mechanics.Its one thing to dislike the game but I think your particular criticisms are unwarranted and misguided.,boardgames,cfsk0w8,5,t5_2qmjp

Recipes are made scrabble style meaning you can build off of the previously played tiles and the recipes range in difficulty from easy  ingredient avocado rolls up to the deadly yet delicious  ingredient Fugu. Mearly assemble all the ingredients on your card and youve made the recipe but get them in the exact order listed on the card and you earn style points for your sushi mastery. I like it a lot.

643172,0,t1_cgdd95j,You are drawing a long bow when it comes to my interpretations of ALL games and forms of competition. I despise kingmaking not games with kingmaking in them. Kingmaking is not only an option in a game but a choice by a player so it is not  mechanics. I play with people who do not participate in kingmaking in general but not all players are so nice.Kingmaking is not possible in all games. The choices DURING a game have nothing to do with kingmaking it is only the choice that ENDS the game that is kingmaking. I am unsure if you understand this since you think any game with choices has the potential. The choices made during play have nothing to do with a kingmaker scenario nothing at all it is only the ONE FINAL choice that actually ENDS the game that is kingmaking. And only if that choice has the potential to choose the winner between two other players.It is a valid point about Dominion because the opportunity appears more regularly than other games that I have played  which makes it worth mentioning now and not necessarily for other games.,boardgames,cgddnuy,-2,t5_2qmjp

There are still dice rolls but they are D dice sorta and most of the points in each battle come from cards you put in so the variance is much lower.Your gang each player is a gang fighting for control of the city is represented by a deck of cards that you can recruit gang members into. In this way there is some deck building and deck management that reminds me of Dominion.The game claims to take  minutes but I think  hours is more realistic. Maybe my group isnt very good at it yet. It is  players with one side of the board meant for an even number of players and the flip side suited for  players.On a different note have you looked into Descent nd Edition?  people playing as heros vs  player who is the overlord.

677742,0,t1_cgha63g,A lot of the complexity in the game seems to come from just having lots of rules and little fiddly bits. The same is true for Le Havre for me and even a game like Caverna is pushing it a little bit. This makes it tedious to explain have it explained and makes it difficult for new players to think of what to do. It just feels like a bit of lazy game design.  Puerto Rico or even Alien Frontiers seem to have a better balance with fewer explicit rules and bits while still having different strategies and some balance.,boardgames,cghb5nt,-1,t5_2qmjp

Another player in a different game claimed that no one told her that even though Xanathar gets  VP for corruption tokens at the end of the game he still takes the negative value on the corruption track as well.

724441,0,t1_cgi7oww,Sure and dont worry I dont think youre a jerk for asking. The comparison has been made in the past so weve had to explain it before. One of the biggest things we wanted to avoid was the endless takethat of Munchkin where everyone can turn on one person. In Ghoulash everyone can call a challenge when you fight a Ghoul but only one person can actually be the challenger the person with the highest Value challenge. After that challenge is over regardless of outcome thats all there is there is no followup.Id say that the biggest selling point is the mythology behind the game. Weve been working on expanding the story and characters since the game launched in . Each characters not only has a unique backstory but that story is reflected in the way each character plays. While there are core elements similar to each of the characters value cards steal cards Danger cards there are unique specialty cards exclusive to each character. We believe in asymmetrical balance that makes the game different yet fair depending on who youre playing as.There is also not a way to die in our game. You take wounds and after  wounds the Ghouls get tougher but you dont have to restart or anything like that. Wounds can be healed by skipping a movement and action phase or using a medkit.,boardgames,cgmmeus,2,t5_2qmjp

In Agricola you Take the wood or Plow a Field it all makes sense and is a logical single action to improving your farm.  In Caverna you Take the wood which allows you to clear two land tiles of which one is a plowed field and if that happens to be a food spot you get the food  Its like every spot in Caverna is  spots in Agricola and you can go in way more directions. Doesnt look as good as Agricola or perhaps just more abstract I miss the card art. Is probably a better game than Agricola but I still love Agricola just as much.,boardgames,cgpoo09,2,t5_2qmjp

772922,0,t3_2303hz,This week I got to play my new purchase PaperbackId somehow managed to miss out on the kickstarter but discussion in boardgames chat had made me aware of it and the publisher was still selling copies directly.  With it being a deck building word game I knew it would be a hit for my wife and so it was.  It handles the melding of the two worlds well. One thing that may not be initially obvious is that all the card effects timing is different. In Dominion and other deck builders youre playing cards one at a time which allows for  effects to happen to the next card you play. With a word game youre playing all the cards in your word at once as youre playing a word.  So you cant have cards that allow you to play more cards or draw more cards that turn or have an effect on subsequently played cards because that no longer makes sense.However  you can have effects based on adjacency or on future phases such as more money for the buy phase or more cards for the next turn. There are even some attack cards that limit how players can play in their next turn.After a single play Id say that an obvious initial strategy seems to be to acquire cards that allow for additional cards to be drawn. Having a card advantage is huge because in general more cards means longer words and longer words means more money for making your next purchase. Longer words also can allow for the acquisition of the common card and progress towards the end of the game though in our case the game ended from the c and c wild card stacks emptying.I think my favourite moment came when the player to my right played an attack limiting the rest of us to  letters max for our next word. I already had a larger hand of cards than normal from a card draw card played the previous turn.  This turn I played a  letter word which included  card next turn for each card remaining in your hand which allowed me to draw a large hand next turn too All in all it was a great hit especially for the newer member of the group who is very new to contemporary games but was very familiar with Scrabble.If I have one minor niggle its with the wording on some cards that say If you trash a card from your hand lteffectgt.  I was already aware of the issue as it had been discussed in boardgames. The problem is that it sounds like a triggered effect and you have to be play a card with the ability to trash another card for that effect to take place. In reality that card effect is itself allowing you to trash a card.  If it were Dominion the wording would have been You may trash a card from your hand. If you do lteffectgt which I think is somewhat more clear.,boardgames,cgs4wbj,3,t5_2qmjp

790944,0,t1_cgu04or,Absolutely. It gives you the same fun conquering feelings as Risk except nobody gets eliminated and combat is very streamlined. IMHO the major problems with Risk are getting eliminated very early and having to wait around and the horrible slog of the endgame wherein you roll a billion times to resolve simple combat. In Small World conquering is done in a single step. And if your current army is doing badly you simply abandon them and start again with a new one. Its more akin to a Eurogames pacing. Whereas Risk lets the leader earn more units and snowball his way to victory Small World has the leader spread his army thin so it is harder to hold territory. ,boardgames,cgu6n4m,3,t5_2qmjp

822486,1,t1_cgxr87t,gt Im not talking about luck or random chanceImbalance is always about luck. It may be that the imbalance is deliberate but from the players perspective someone is going to randomly get an advantage. Maybe the advantage comes from having first pick of asymmetric powers presumably they randomly got picked to go first. Maybe its just because theres a firstturn advantage like Dominion. But the only kind of game in which imbalance wouldnt be determined by luck is a game where all players have equal access to whatever makes the game imbalanced. Then if a player makes the lowerpowered choice no big deal.My point getting to your original question is that designers focus on balance because players tend to dislike imbalance. Because imbalance makes it feel too much like luck had a significant deciding factor in the game. How important is balance? Thats a subjective question. I think its important. Designers tend to think its important. But games can be successful without it.,boardgames,cgxrod0,2,t5_2qmjp

Eg rope hmmm build rope why what does rope give me how do I get the rope into use how does it interact with other cardsparts of the board. There are a lot of wasted surfaces in the game the reverse side of each equipment tile the repeated icon of the single mandouble man on each of the card stack spaces.

903414,0,t1_ch6v3lt,Dominion actually has a very good builtin catchup mechanism to keep games getting too far out of reach.  The genius mechanic in Dominion is the way the victory point cards which you need to win duh do absolutely nothing for you during the game... in fact theyre a hindrance.  So someone who jumps out to an early lead is going to find themselves in a slog while other players have a chance to catch up.Also because youre building your deck from the ground up so to speak and because everyone starts with the same deck its not like anyones good cards are going to come up early simply by luck of the draw.  Because you are constantly recycling and reshuffling your deck the distribution of lucky draws is far more dispersed and has less impact.,boardgames,ch6z1vp,2,t5_2qmjp

951813,0,t3_24yj0t,My whole group of friends loves this one called The Game of Things. Basically one player reads off a category Things you shouldnt say to a police officer Things that make you gag that kind of thing and everyone else takes a blank slip of paper writes down a thing that fits into the category and hands it to the reader. Then that guy reads off all the answers and the rest of the players take turns trying to match an answer with the player who said it. If someone guesses your answer youre out. Points for guessing correctly and for being the last one in the round. If your friends are funny this game will always be funny. Some people play for laughs some people try to play mind games and answer what they think other people would say. The categories can all be taken innocuously but at least a few answers always end up being filthy.

968476,0,t1_checldq,gt it is so plagued with luck dominate events that the game is ruined for me. You may have this awesome well thought out strategy but you are doomed from the beginning because you started next to planets with crappy resources. You may have won the battle but you only draw  victory point from the bag while your opponent drew a  VP chip from his battle. I dont know what the designers were thinking when they put that many great ideas into a game that is virtually pure luck.I dunno I dont think youve played enough Eclipse if you think its a pure luck game. The fact is you cant really go into Eclipse with a set strategy the strategy is determining the best course of action based on the available technologies the areas you explore your racial bonuses etc.Its tough to see the balance because it operates at a subtle level. You want to have early combats so you can draw from the best reputation tiles but you dont want to have combat too early or you will lose ships. You want a good selection of hexes to control but you dont want to control too many or you are limited in the actions you can take. You want to limit the number of connections to other players but you also want to have some connections so you can attack them if they start to take the lead etc. Its fine if you dont like Eclipse its not for everyone. But theres no way it would be rated so highly if what you were saying is true. I havent had a single game where weve looked at the winner and said man you just got really lucky that whole game. ,boardgames,chedj1n,2,t5_2qmjp

971479,0,t1_chep19m,Technically youre right if someone wanted to they could Netdeck a Runner and Corp deck from the internet buy the appropriate data packs and be set up to enter a tournament.  And for some people that might be enough.  But I would never call that getting serious about Netrunner.That player did not create a deck of their own they did not put time into thinking what cards should be in the deck and why.  They didnt ever have to ask themselves the hard questions about deckbuilding.  I really want this card in this deck but does it really belong?  This card is strong but am I actually going to use it?  Does this fit my playstyle?  This identity is alright but would this be a stronger setup in a different identity?  Why do I have drip economy instead of burst?  Is my playstyle catered to such a slow economy?Deckbuilding takes effort and a dash of passion I would never build a virtual deck then buy only the cards I needed mainly because my decks change almost daily.  That tends to happen when you build a deck for any card game.  You put it all together you set it on the table youre ready to go.  Everything looks great on paper amazing in fact!  And then you actually play the deck in a game aaaaand it just doesnt work.  But then you have the power to start thinking about it.  Hmm...that card didnt work as well as I expected it to.  Okay this card ended up being my silver bullet to win the game but is that reliable?  Do I need more ways to find these cards or just include more copies?  Do I need this much money?  Was that enough money?  Were these breakers worth it?  And that deck you were so confident in an hour ago starts to transform.And thats essential to the process Build a deck Play a lot of Netrunner Think about what changes could be made Make some tweaks to your deck See Step  and repeat foreverNetdecking is fine for getting into the bare minimum of tournament play.  But without access to the card pool youre losing a the ability to make probably necessary changes to your decks b flexibility in what you play c understanding of card synergy that only comes with practice and actually using those cards d understanding the cards that synergize well with your playstyle Vamp is an amazing card but I rarely use when its in my decks because it doesnt suit my playstyle therefore it usually gets cut in favor of something that fits my archetype better. e experimenting with different combinations until you find something that you really loveEveryone is going to have a different playstyle while finding and using an AndySucker deck from the internet might be strong it might not suit your particular taste for the game.  So yes maybe you go to a few local meet ups and do okay but overall are you having fun playing the game?  For some that could be the turning point for them to say I tried to get into Netrunner but wasnt really enjoying it.And should it come as a surprise?  Their creativity was snuffed out.  Instead of taking the game and seeking to make it their own and finding their own niche they copied what the internet said was the best and then find out the hard way that what the internet said was best doesnt suit them.  If you have all the cards you need at hand you now have the flexibility to try other combinations within that deck or try a new identityfaction altogether.  And thats what makes Netrunner so awesome deckbuilding is an addiction and something youre always thinking about.  I dont think you can ever be truly good at the game until youve come at it from multiple different angles trying out different styles archetypes characters and cards playing a deck that turns out to be bad and then asking yourself why it turned out bad then going from there to slowly get better.  Without that kind of learning youll never really improve.So long rant made short yes you can definitely play tournament netrunner by just building an internet deck and buying the cards you need.  But my opinion stands that if you want to be serious about playing Netrunner that just isnt going to cut it and will be a huge barrier to you becoming better at the game.,boardgames,chept39,1,t5_2qmjp

If you decide to get it I recommend investing in some plastic bins to save time putting ship tech on the board. First few games might be a bit slow but once your group gets the swing of things. It should speed up immensely.Tsuro is remarkably simple to play. You could explain the rules without speaking if you wanted to. It plays up to eight and can lead to many laughs from the table as people get trapped to their doom. If you want to add a more random element I can also suggest getting Tsuro of the seas.

Every player responds to every almost except for the Prospector role so everyone isnt sitting around bored while everyone ahead of them takes their turn.Its competitive.

999274,0,t1_chhoa14,Trieste was the game that I happened to enjoy the most. Its a three player card game. In trieste there are three factions the city watch the merchants and the thieves. Depending on which faction you get determines your turn order with city watch going first then merchants and lastly the thieves. Depending on your choice of faction your victory conditions change. As the city watch your trying to catch a certain number of thieves as the thieves your trying to gain infamywhich you get by successfully playing certain cards and the merchants have toattain an x amount of gold which is modified by the number of thieves captured. So you have three forces all competing to win yet sometimes having to team up to take down the stronger player. Overall a very enjoyable game and I ended up buying it after that. The only things I could really hold against this game is that it only plays with three players... No more no less... Five is right out!Knockout is an interesting board game. You start the game on a small grid fight ring with eight cards and seven healthmight be different numbers of cardshealth. There are different types of cards which will help you attack or defend. Now as you play this game you will realize that it is very momentum heavy. Your health for example is a reflection of how many cards you can hold as your health gets lower and lower its harder to defend yourself. In order to get more cards you have to take a breather which means you forfeit your action and draw two cards. There are all sorts of cards available to you such as moves punches dodges and so on. Each of these cards has been assigned a numerical value which represents the strength of the attack or skillfullness of the dodge. Now you can only play a single card to attacklets say its a haymaker with a  then the defender must either move out of the way or come up with the right number to defend himselfsuch as a  dodge and a  dodge. This makes you want to save your more powerful attacks for when you have your opponent cornered as they can slip away with a move card and youve wasted a powerful punch.I enjoyed knockout quite a bit. Its a fun time waster though it lacks a bit of depth but seeing how short the game is mins I dont think it matters that much.

In politics and so forth you have to kind of steer an independent organism the people. In most competitive games with this theme you just place cubes and remove other peoples cubes effectively removing the illusion of an independent thinking populace.

Dixit Origins aka Dixit  an card expansion    promo cards available from the BGG store I own all of the above sets.  I buy the expansions primarily to collect the fascinating artwork and secondly to add more variability to our games.Theres no formal way to distinguish what card comes from what expansion so all of my cards have become fully mixed together over multiple plays.  The various sets all play just fine when mixed together and I honestly cant tell which expansion a given card belongs in  with one big exception  Journey.  The artist for Journey is Xavier Collette his artwork is noticeable lighter in tone with a more cartoony art style than the other sets.  Also some folks argue that his artwork is less abstract than Cardouats.Meanwhile Marie Cardouat is the primary artist for vanilla Dixit as well as the expansion sets Quest and Odyssey.  All of her art blends together beautifully and is sufficiently abstract for the games purposes.  Sidenote for Cardouat fans  She also illustrated the new game Steam Park.As an FYI the most recent expansion s Origins features a new artist in Clment Lefevre.  Her art is more in the vein of Cardouats.  Im a fan.With that said theres no real reason to keep Journey separate from the other expansions.  They play together just fine.  Its a personal decision if youre too OCD to mix artists as Ive seen some people online mention.As for your second question all expansions have entirely unique cards so theres no fear of getting duplicate cards in different sets.  tldr  All the Dixit expansions feature gorgeous artwork and integrate seamlessly with each other.  You cant go wrong with picking up any of them in any order whenever you feel like it.,boardgames,chl436w,2,t5_2qmjp

1033765,0,t3_25xv5d,Being a Dallas Games Marathon weekend I got in more than usual soTiny Epic Defenders x Still playing through the prototype copy I received. Played with   and  players now and its beastly. I think it goes on Kickstarter June st. Pumped. Great coop.Marvel Dice Masters x Taught a busy how to play while he waits for his copy of the starter set. I really enjoy the game but Im glad the luster has worn off on me a bit. I needed to stop spending money on it.Race for the Galaxy Solo I still really like the robot AI. It feels so much different than a person. On the easiest setting I won. I havent the guts to ratchet it up to medium difficulty. Someday soon...Seasons A twoplayer game! I wasnt a huge fan of it initially but it has warmed up now. I think its pretty good with two but Id prefer three I think.Innovation Taught this to two guys. They did really well but I was able to eek out my fifth achievement and win. One guy was hyper defensive while the other was hyper aggressive. I just kept grabbing points left and right. It was nice. Carcassonne The Castle A friend of mine who was worn out on Carcassonne asked about this on my shelf. I keep it because I feel it holds a different niche than Carcassonne. It offers some interesting decisions to make along with being only  player.Kingdom Builder x Wife wanted this one. We got it. Solid gateway game with a good level of decisionmaking. Its fast too!AndroidNetrunner x Havent gotten this to the table in a while. Beating. I lost. Significantly. Man I need to give it up or get better.Machi Koro x Still really like this game. Quick fun easy filler. July American printing come on!Star Realms Everyones been talking about this so I let a guy destroy TEACH me how to play. Pretty neat. Might pick it up one day. Might not.Ginkgopolis First time playing for my wife and I. Friend taught us and its a pretty neat game with fun mechanics. I would play this one again.Nuns on the Run Totally uninterested in this one but the hidden writing movement mechanic is actually pretty neat. The game went a little long but I might actually play again if in the right mood.Takenoko Played with . Resounding victory Huzzah!Spyrium I definitely dont play this game enough though I like it. I got demolished. I tried different strategy this time and went all out money. Anything and everything that could give me money I went for. I build absolutely ZERO factories and did pretty well. Still lost got rd place out of  but it was still a fun venture.Kemet Oh man.  players who havent played before learning and playing. Ive played Cyclades a few times but not this one. It didnt help. The game went really long Ive heard thats normal for Kemet but my interest was waning in last place as the game continued on. Who knows? Ill give it another shot. With three players. edit formatting!,boardgames,chlsl7e,2,t5_2qmjp

1079446,0,t1_chqxbla,I have some degree of OCD when it comes to organization and storage. Box lids have to face the same way as the back of the box. Components must be stacked together. Everything needs to be symmetrical. That sort of thing.Lords of Waterdeep is a freaking nightmare for me. When I looked at the Scoundrels of Skullport storage guide I wanted to cry. The  Lords cards go in  separate spots. The buildings go in multiple compartments. The  boards dont fit snugly they have to overlap. All the little tiles are VERY fiddly to put away especially when things like the gold and victory points have to be separated because they dont all fit in one box. The buildings are the worst they get scattered in multiple spots across  boxes. It drove me freaking nuts. I confess I didnt bother trying to put the gold victory points and the rest in their designated spots. Theyre in separate baggies.Oh and my entire board game collection is in bookshelves on their sides. So when I put the games away components scatter.

1083769,0,t3_26i3vd,Some great suggestions in this thread but Id like to add a few more.A Game of Thrones Board game   the area control of Risk crossed with the backstabbery of Diplomacy. You can check out the rules and a video tutorial at Ikusa previously known as Samurai Swords previously known as Shogun. While there are Risklike elements to the fighting the resource management aspect makes it a very different experience. And theres murdering ninja  what more could you ask for? Nice review here Conquest of Nerath  dont be misled by the DampD branding this one isnt a dungeon crawl although there are dragons. Review here Now if youd like a game that concentrates more on resources and plays faster than Risk but still scratches much the same itch Shogun by Queen Games not to be confused with Ikusa which was previously named Shogun is a good choice.

1203418,0,t3_27tljr,Your concern about having to buy the newest ships to stay competitive with xwing is unfounded. First Xwing has a points system where more powerful ships cost more points so you cant use as many of them. Second the game is probably  skill  luck and  which ships you use. The first two ships in the game xwings and tie fighters are still great ships. One of the best squads is still just  tie fighters. Newer ships might add variety by introducing new abilities and tactics but they wont be simply better than the existing ships and the better pilot will still usually win.It can get expensive if youre the type to get addicted to buying new things since there will always be new things to buy. If you want to compete in tournaments using a variety of squads that can be expensive too. But you can buy all your favorite ships build at least one competitive squad and have hours of fun with your friends all for under  which is pretty good as miniatures games go and youll never have to spend more although youll probably want to.,boardgames,ci503wd,2,t5_2qmjp

After youve got all the art assets ready assembly of the prototype shouldnt take very long. You dont need to use high quality materials like thick clay poker chips. Its a prototype! Nobody expects high quality and a quality prototype says nothing about what the published game will be like. Use cheaper chips! Use cardboard even or just leave it as flat paper. A cheap printable prototype is all you need. You can also use scaled down art to keep ink cost down.

1350092,0,t3_29g3yq,for me I liked the mechanics and it was interesting to play. there are three stages or whatever and they each get progressively harder. However the only real gripping parts are in the second and third stages. The game took a long time for what it is if they got rid of the first stage or made it much faster it would probably have a lot better ratio of time spent vs luck factor. Citadels is like that too its clever but it takes so long to ramp up to the really interesting parts. Both games need a way to jump start to the fun parts and they would be a lot better. ,boardgames,cilixl8,1,t5_2qmjp

1363401,0,t3_29nv4i,Many initial games include a science blowout before people know to watch out for it. The best defense is very simple plan to build one set of science cards yourself. It will get you a respectable  points for  cards and it will make it very very hard for anyone to get a gigantic science holding. This is also a threat that you will build more which will force other players to do odd things to stop you.I believe you have it backwards about bad players although admittedly the general point still stands that seating order matters. If you sit next to someone that is bad they wont know what cards to deny you so theyll pass you a lot of good hands. Theyll build too many brown and gray cards which saves you from building them yourself. Theyll build either gobs of military or none either of which you can exploit.Its true that your effect on the other side of the table is limited but thats in exchange for having higher influence on the people near you. I find that to be a fun part of the game personally. Its more interesting than the usual setup where you mainly care about the person whos in the lead.Finally if your opponents are playing in such a way that it makes it hard for you to win... doesnt that mean they are playing well?,boardgames,cin6wyt,1,t5_2qmjp

I would rank them in my order of preference as Daybreak Pegasus ExodusThere is a fantastic combined rulebook pdf on BGG that makes playing with all or some of the expansions very easy and streamlined. Lastly try to identify some of the key skill cards that youll want to use for their text vs. using them for voting purposes.  For example youll usually want to use the Leadership card Executive Order for its text if possible.  The Tactics cards Launch Scout and Strategic Planning are often underestimated.

Turns out theres not a single copy of nd edition on ebay so I may end up making a mint on it or at least getting my money back.Got a solo game of Battlestar Galactica in as well since I havent been able to get it to the table in awhile.  Actually plays quite well if you pick a character that has a broad skill set.  Going to play again with the Exodus expansion  add the cylon fleet board and add allies with random trauma tokens on them to spice things up a bit.

1405921,0,t3_2a8ab8,EDIT I was confusing super crisis with loyalty card ability. You only lose the loyalty card ability by revealing from the brig. This is what I get for waiting too long in between plays.One small thing Id point out is that cylons that reveal while in the brig do not get a super crisis card. Thats why they want to try to reveal before they are found out or try to get out of the brig before revealing. Id also agree with the other advice here about making sure you all work together. I think you should go through the rulebook make sure you didnt make any other rule errors and try to play again. But I can see why you might not want to play it again from this first experience. Personally I love it but I did watch the show and it really captures the feel of the show which makes it more fun for me.

That being said I just got an email telling me theyre moving to a bigger store.  I have frequently given them money rather than Coolstuff even when they had a big markup just because it was such a nice place.  The other store which I will not name is a troll cave.  The people working there either only play Magic The Gathering or dont know anything about board games with ONE exception.  The store is dirty.  The counter looks like it has accumulated every single bit and piece of detritus of the last  years worth of board games.  The lighting is awful.  The people are extremely loud.  The playspace while massive feels like walking into a dragons den.  The players are rude.  The environment stinks.This place doesnt even have wifi in the building.  No WIFI.

1425412,0,t3_2afibm,The app blows it way out of the water. I bought it before the physical game and was just not left with enough incentive to get the game to my table frequently. The actual game not the app is very easy. I actually found it more of a challenge to lose than to win. Sure its short and simplebut those are really the only positives other than nice components. The theme doesnt hold up very well the replay value diminishes quickly and while there is an expansion it really just doesnt feel like its worth saving. The app on the other hand offers real challenge holds the theme up much better and you can purchase adventurestyle expansions that actually create a story and offer some of the most challenging coop game scenarios Ive ever faced. Plus you can get the entire suite for less than the price of the physical base game.

Gaming the evil meter to get the weakest adventures. Timing your inactive cards and your ordering to ensure you get the most out of each round. Balancing defense vs economy. Eminent Domain Escalation I really enjoy the scenarios and learning each one and how it plays differently in various matchups is really interesting to me.

1448954,0,t3_2aqzym,I love it I think its a solid game. Heres a loose list of reasons for why I like it. Its pretty much off the top of my head also I havent played it in ages Theres a real simplicity to its design I think. It feels like it has just the mechanicssystems needed and nothing more. In fact it almost feels like the game would fall apart if you simplified it further. I think this is also why I dont really like the first expansion. It just feels bolted on. There is fighting between players yay for player interaction! and crucially despite this it has no player elimination. Also the fighting feels somewhat tactical as you have to spend multiple turns in order to attack First set up a fleet for transport then move the troops in. Here the order of the gods can also matter so much. Theres multiple aspects you need to balance You need military in order to defend yourself and maybe also make some attacks but you also want the various buildings maybe philosophyers and also want economy in the form of Zeuss temples and priests. This makes for some good hard choices I think. Which are wonderful to have in boardgames I think. About Zeus thats one potentital bad thing I think. If a player manages to get ahead on prieststemples it can cause a bit of a runaway situation. Boosting your economy seems too good almost. I realize there is an element of selfbalance in that you can overbid him and he has dimished returns on getting more priests as opposed to doing other actions. I dont really think it is a problem but I can see if others such as your friend might find it a problem. The theme and its components are lovely as well. The fact that the board is designed to look like you are looking at a greek gods animated... table portal thing is just brilliant. not quite sure what to call it.

1504172,0,t1_cj4mrqd,My top recommendation here would be Dominion.  Its simple to learn but difficult to master.  I played a lot of Settlers in high school but this was the game that truly me into the hobby.  Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne are two other very popular gateway games.  Ill also mention Small World as a popular and fairly simple game.  Its kind of like Risk but much faster and with less dice rolling and more fantasy creatures. Wonders is one of my favourite games.  Im starting to hesitate on recommending it as a simple game because it takes a while to explain all the symbols on the cards the game is minimal text. The first game is usually tough because new players dont know what to expect.  But after one or two games players realize how simple it really is.  Theres still a lot of tactics and strategy to figure too which is nice.  The best thing about it is that it plays up to  people in half an hour once people know what they are doing.,boardgames,cj4tkt3,1,t5_2qmjp

1509448,0,t3_2bfvwa,I owned Dungeon Lords for quite some time and then traded it away.  Here are my thoughts.  Its a good game and very challenging.  You are getting beat up by the game and win if you come limping over the finish just like his other creation Galaxy Trucker.  .  Unlike Galaxy Trucker the game is WAY too long for what it is.  A game of Dungeon Lords is going to be  hours and can take even longer.  If you have the same players all the time it can be less than that but  hours is a good estimate.  .  The worker placement mechanic works really nicely.  The best positions act last and may not get anything at all.  Do you risk the big reward or do you take a smaller reward that it guaranteed and gives you more control?  .  The rest of the game is solitaire and just a little dungeon creation puzzle.  Once you know the game the puzzle is always the same.  .  Tons of downtime and the game suffers badly from Analysis Paralysis.  Even normal players take a long time to figure out their turn.  Slow players...dont even invite them to the table.  .  Its also a hard game to learn.  The game itself is long but teaching it is also very long.  And its fiddly so throughout the game people will be reconsulting the rulebook trying to remember what everything does and then when it comes time to build their dungeon realize that they didnt do it right at all and are totally out of the game.  With  hours still to play.  .  It does have great artwork fun theme and a silly rulebook that is enjoyable to read.  Its not a bad game but there are so many worker placement games out there that are more fun to play.  Also at  even with bonuses and expansion the price seems pretty steep.  This is why I decided to get rid of my copy when the demand was high.,boardgames,cj5hgpi,1,t5_2qmjp

1524432,0,t3_2blj7i,Ive played five or six games and I think its great. Its certainly more swingy but thats ok as Ascension is a tactical thinkonyourfeet game so dealing with crazy swings is a feature not a bug. I absolutely understand the negative reviews the paper version of this expansion have gotten because theres a lot more accounting but since the iPad handles that for you its largely seamless on iOS. And so far the third resource which mostly applies to cards that do other things already makes the deck building deeper as you value cards differently depending on how youre already building.If I were a tournament Ascension player I see why this might be a turnoff but in mostly play against the AI during my commute and so far this adds a lot to the game. ,boardgames,cj7d4o5,3,t5_2qmjp

1546522,0,t3_2byasj,Im going to probably definitely have some overlap here but what the hey. Word or warning  is a tough number and a lot of these will play  at most. Purto Rico This game is great. Lighter than some strategy games but a Euro game without player elimination low randomness little direct competition with medium complexity. Its quite fun for me because everyone takes actions on everyones turn so you never have down time really. That sounds stressful but it is not. It just keeps you engaged and I like that. Plays up to . The Manhattan Project  This one is like Lords of Waterdeep. Its more thematic has more player on player interaction and is a little more complex when it comes to your machine for completing objectives. Its a beautiful game and even if you dont play it you can sit there and stare at it for hours and entertain yourself that way! Jokes aside this game is awesome! Get it! Get it now! Or not your choice really. Dominion This is a deckbuilding game where you purchase cards to build your deck and the player with the most victory point cards at the end wins. There is randomness but thats what makes it a game. The cards you include in your deck are your choice. Also the base box comes with a lot of different cards and which ones you have out you select  randomly or by choice so every game is different. I like this game a lot and you might too! Galaxy Trucker Ok... here me out. This game is everything your friends hate. Its tense youre timed and racing the clock its random youre flipping through tiles as fast as you can to build a ship and its completely crazy. But it is loads of fun. Watch this video to get a feel Now that youre thoroughly convinced you will never buy this game let me sell you on it. The overwhelming bit subsides because it isnt coop its competitive and everyone is in the same disheveled sinking boat not actually youre building space ships but that sounds like a fun game doesnt it?. You are all trying to make your ships as fast as you can with a shared pool of resources and youre going as fast as you can placing them in a haphazard kind of mess and eventually everyone has these weird looking pieces of crap youre going to try and fly through space. And its hilarious. The randomess isnt quite like normal randomness in that it is random which pieces you pick up but its your choice of where to place them if at all. So you cant blame randomness for mistakes. Therefore its very strategic how you place your tiles yet you may get into situations where it is difficult to fit everything. This game plays  out of the box which is kind of a bummer but plays up to  with expansions. It is also a relatively expensive game so it may not be your first choice. But if youre ever presented with the opportunity to play this game sieze it!,boardgames,cja4p3j,4,t5_2qmjp

I understand people purchasing it for a few plays to understand the limitations of the deckbuilding mechanic etc... but a gateway game should have very high replayability.

I cant say a whole lot about it since Ive only gotten to play it a few times but Ive quite enjoyed it. The orb part of it was great and really didnt detract from the experience as some people mentioned. I know its a lovehate relationship with people but I found it quite enjoyable. The rest of the cards that were mixed in felt fun and more balanced than the previous sets.As for the other  expansions. They do tend to make the game far more unwieldy but I also enjoyed them for what they brought to the table. I never bother with Takeovers but I liked everything else that was introduced.Honestly you could go one of a few ways Just stick with the base game which has a LOT of replayabilty. Get just the first expansion as that adds a lot more options start worlds and goals as well as a brilliant solo game. Quite a lot to explore with just this and the base. Slowly start adding in the ndrd expansion once you get bored with the first expansion. Just get the AA expansion since it adds about as many fun cards as the first expansion for RFTG did. Also you get a fun orb game thats completely separate from the base game.Simplest route would be getting either expansion  or AA and stopping there as it seems to be preferred by most people.

Additionally the card distribution just feels off with only  players.  I say  is better than  because tabling cards where you get to see some of the same cards you started with is a big and interesting part of drafting as a mechanic and losing that definitely does lose something from the game. ,boardgames,cjhzy6p,2,t5_2qmjp

1619826,0,t3_2cv3lq,If you like Risk a few things jump directly to mind Small World  Area control like Risk placing armies and spreading from one territory to the next while displacing your opponents. You choose a fantasy race to start the game but as your armies overextend themselves eventually its time to put your active race In Decline so you can add a new one to the board. Plays in under an hour and a half often under an hour and the sheer number of possible Race  Special Power combinations makes the game super super replayable. Theres also a lot less dice rolling which is nice. Kemet  Egyptianthemed Dudes On A Map game. This one is super fighty and fast because you can literally teleport your guys directly into the areas that are worth victory points and one of the only ways to win permanent victory points is by winning battles as the attacker. So youre attacking and being attacked every single turn. Meanwhile youre also managing an economy of Prayer Points that let you raise and move armies and also build Pyramids and buy Power Tiles that let you take extra actions buff your armies or let you summon giant scorpions or mummies to fight with your guys. The pyramids and Power Tiles add a nice element of longterm strategy to help guide all the tactical decisions you have to make every turn. No dice here  instead you have a hand of battle cards. Some are better than others but you have to play your whole hand before you get any of them back so its all about choosing the right moments to use those killer cards. Diplomacy  I bet no game has ever made more Risk players swear off Risk than Diplomacy. Youre trying to control Supply Centers  strategically important cities  on a map of WWIera Europe. Unlike Risk youre only allowed one unit per territory and theres no dice rolling at all so to successfully take ground from an opponent you need support from a unit in another territory. This could be your unit or another players so it becomes clear pretty quickly you cant do anything without allies. And then its just a matter of stabbing your allies in the back at the exact right moment before they can do the same to you. Each turn consists of  minutes of negotiation during which you can leave the table to have private conversations and dealmaking and then everyones moves are written down and revealed at once so you write down an order to move your army into Belgium because you know you have support from England but he decided not to help at the last second so your attack fails and now it turns out England has turned around and aided Germanys attack on you. It suffers with less than the full  players it takes  to  hours to play and it may put deep lasting cracks in your reallife friendships. In short its fucking great. Game of Thrones is adapted from Diplomacys rules but plays in about half the time and of course is set in Westeros. It throws a few bells and whistles on top of the Diplomacystyle simultaneous reveal ActionHoldSupport mechanics including some hand management a bidding mechanic and a few randomizers which Diplomacy lacks entirely. Its really good and lots of people prefer it to Diplomacy I think. I prefer the first game just because I think the extra mechanics GoT adds strip away some of the pure brutal emphasis on deception and negotiation that Diplomacy has.,boardgames,cjjcfe4,5,t5_2qmjp

1650660,0,t1_cjn3p1e,I agree  my favorite game to teach is Escape.  I love watching it as it clicks with people.  I teach the game by building up to the cool parts adding a series of oh by the way comments.First I explain the premise of the game.  Were all trapped in a temple trying to escape by rolling dice.  Oh by the way were working together and if ANY of us dont make it out we ALL lose.Then I explain how to use dice to accomplish actions.  Roll two men to reveal a new room roll whats written next to a gem to unlock a gem etc.  I explain that these dice are rolled and rerolled like in Yahtzee but with no limit to the number of rerolls.  Oh by the way  if you roll a black mask that die is locked and cant be rolled again until you use a gold mask to unlock two black masks.  Here I usually throw in a mention about the mechanic of using the gems to unlock masks for everyone but go out of my way to stress that EVERYONE needs to agree to use a gem before we can do so.Then I explain that you can share the dice with people who are in the same room.  So since I just explained locking masks I use the example of me using a gold die to unlock somebody elses black mask or us working together to unlock a gem.  Oh by the way the reason we can do this is because we are all rolling the dice AT THE SAME TIME.  The game is played simultaneously!  Holy crap!  We can roll as fast as we want.Then I explain that the game is played to a soundtrack which acts as a timer and we have exactly ten minutes to escape from the temple.  This is why we are playing in real time.  Holy crap!  Oh by the way the soundtrack also has two gongs in it  and when those gongs go off we have a minute to get back to the starting room and if you dont you LOSE A FREAKING DIE FOR THE REST OF THE GAME!  Holy crap!At this point since Ive sold the game and the new players minds are thoroughly blown I typically go back and rehash the basic ideas and fill in any more subtle details about the rules.  Id even typically play out a couple of rolls just to demonstrate what Im talking about before we dig into the game proper.,boardgames,cjn89h8,3,t5_2qmjp

Lots of people in the group are massive fans of Cthulu theme role playing and Battlestar Galactica by the same designer Corey Konieczka. Naturally therefore we were pretty excited for MoM.Sadly the game is riddled with flaws and issues to the point that even attempts to houserule the holes to fix it werent going to work. Most of the scenarios were found to be imbalanced heavily in either the keeper or players favor uninteresting after a single playthrough reliant on players not knowing certain potential things you WOULD know after a single playthrough and so on. Now some of those might mean the first play or two are fun of each scenario but for how big and expensive this game is you kinda expect more than about  games total. Some scenarios have specific issues on top of these general ones  especially scenario  I seem to remember being incredibly broken give the traitor card to the person with the clue key win and also punishing the heroes with instant loss for doing something theyre encouraged to do in the first four scenarios of exploring the house. And thats not the only issues really. You can realistically punch to death just about every enemy  and in general they arent that threatening. Theres weird abuses of the horror mechanics. And really this is just the issues I remember off the top of my head from a few plays a few years back.This ended up being a bit of a rant but yeah everyone in our group was seriously disappointed in the game.

It sucks even more to have your perfect game ruined by your last place friend throwing a tantrum though. That can spoil the whole game night for all players.Everyone should know what theyre getting into when planning to play a long game especially when you cant just get up and quit without ruining it.

1670915,0,t3_2di9z7,I think the option is there but it may be difficult or more trouble than its worth. As far as I know the traitor can kill the heroes and then be free to complete their objective. But we played with a full group of  players so the heroes could stick together and gang up on the traitor if they tried it.The rule book mentions that in some scenarios monsters can continue moving and completing objectives even if the traitor is dead. So killing the traitor isnt always a surefire win for the heroes but it may make things a little easier if they do it. Or killing the traitor may cause something horrible to happen that I dont know about because I didnt read the traitors tome.My group treats it like a role playing game. Theres a lot of luck involved and some of the scenarios seem to really favor one side over the other. We never really played to win we mostly just played to get a fun story out of it. ,boardgames,cjps496,4,t5_2qmjp

1686438,0,t3_2de524,I think a great strategy game that is a good balance between luck and skill is Lords of Waterdeep. It also tends to be pretty tight and you dont know who will win until the end.

Keep in mind Cosmic Encounter is my favorite game and Ill buy every expansion even though I already have  alien races.

1710877,0,t3_2dv2hz,Im surprised to see some of my favorites not being mentioned but these were my new gaming highlights for the convention names link to their BGG profilesDead of Winter I know most people who currently own this got it about a week before as a preorder but they had a good amount at the show that sold out in . hours on Thursday. I brought my copy with me and everyone I introduced to it absolutely loved it! It was also a blast hanging out with uJonnyRotten to play and talk about the game. One of the best of show. The stories you take away from this game are amazing.Evolution I was fairly certain I would enjoy this one going in but was unprepared just how much. It is a very easy concept and game to explain but there are a lot of different decisions to make since you can use the same cards in five different ways. They were taking preorders for new copies but also auctioning off their openedthatday demo copies each day one of which I nabbed for myself. I am still impressed that they got a worldrenowned nature artist to do the art. It really brings it to life.Cthulhu Wars This was one of the games I wanted to play most at the con and man oh man did it live up to my expectations. Obviously the miniatures are huge and awesome but the game itself is super solid. Each factions power is so high in different ways and you would think that would get out of hand but they contrasted and complemented each other perfectly in terms of game balance. I didnt think it possible but I am even more excited to own it now than I was before Gencon.Those were my top three new games but other notable titles wereNautilus Industries Fun fairly deep economy driven game. Easy to pick Currently being Kickstarted The deluxe version looks particularly awesome especially if they can reach the metal components stretch goals.Eclipse Obviously not new but I bought and played it for the first time and I am in love. Absolutely fantastic game once you get past the fairly steep learning curve.TMG had a slew of games to demo and I tried the upcoming Harbour and Scoville Both games are very fun in different ways. Harbour is quick and easy to pick up with a lot of meaningful decision making with a relatively short play time. Scoville is a fairly deep strategy game wrapped in a fun setting with absolutely awesome components. Very solid mechanics and turn flow in Scoville as well which make it easy to play and give it little downtime if any.Legendary Encounters was also very fun. If you have ever played the previous Legendary games the mechanics are largely the same but they have made it so this game has a much higher focus on coop no victory point comparison at the end and it seems to me at least that it is much harder right out of the box. The theme is applied very very well and if you are a fan of the Alien series and I am but really more of a casual fan you will absolutely love how its done. Played this twice and plan to pick it up later at some point.,boardgames,cjutgim,3,t5_2qmjp

1736980,0,t3_2ec3tx,I think it is totally possible to find a way to make it happen if you want.  And it doesnt even have to be educational or informative or even really historically accurate.  Take a look at Manhattan Project for a game about a fairly recent event that didnt happen at all the way the game makes it look like it happened.  I think a game based around the concept of emergency responses to natural disasters would be very interesting.  For example I could see an interesting game about trying to mitigate the effects of Katrina on New Orleans half of the game trying to get people to evacuate getting responses in place and then the hurricane hitting and flooding the city and the game ending after actually responding to the events.Games about assassinations or espionage could be interesting too where one side is attempting to assassinate a target and the other side is trying to prevent that target from getting killedhelping them escape.

I have REPEATEDLY watched people make choices in the game solely because thats what their characters would have done  thats how engaged they were in the theme.  Things like the noise tokens the influences assigned to characters and the effect they can have on the game the special abilities which match the characters so well the fact that some character backstories are expanded upon with crossroad cards....Dead of Winter is absolutely dripping with theme WAY MORE than BSG.

I mastered Tooth Invaders on the Commodore  the only video game endorsed by the ADA. Mastered. Why? Because we had it.Gonna get a bit codgery here but back in my day you didnt have no internet to share ideas on. We didnt have the Game Crafter either. So no one made new games. If you wanted a game you were going to pick one that Mr. Milton Bradley had spent his money making for you and we were grateful. We didnt have no GenCons. We had the classics. And we liked em and we played em and if we wanted something else that was too bad. If the game wasnt fun or was broken we fixed it with house rules. We didnt have second editions of Pandemic in our day no sir. We didnt even have themed Monopoly. Because Mr. Milton Bradley couldnt afford to take risks like that. We didnt have no CCGs either. Want to collect cards? You better like baseball.We did have mousetrap but that wasnt a game as much as it was an elaborate toy sold in a game box. We had Fireball Island and Crossfire a few newfangled titles. But those werent about strategy or interactions with other people.

Theres a lot of planning analysis and discussion that go into a round of Pandemic and maybe thats just not your thing. For me personally I really enjoy that. My favourite games are those that are complex and multifaceted and require a bit of analysis other people like a bit more random interpersonal activity. When I see a game described as dry and a brainburner on BGG I immediately become interested.Different strokes for different folks I think. For example Cosmic Encounter while I enjoy it I find to be mostly random and to not have much staying power even with all the extra powers. Id much rather play a game where you can really fight against chance as much as possible.,boardgames,ckbsanb,2,t5_2qmjp

1851833,0,t3_2fprkj,There are a lot of good suggestions here already. Here are my two bits.... As mentioned Bang Dice is a good short filler party game. For another simple pushyourluck game that gives you a little more game to sink your teeth into I really like Formula D and it plays up to  people just fine though it gets slower the more players you add which isnt ideal for an F game.. Hive is great. Cant recommend it enough. Personally Id recommend Carbon over Pocket... the originalCarbon are pretty portable already and those big weighty tiles are just great to fiddle with theyre seriously among my favorite components in my collection. I would avoid the mistake of buying the original game since it costs just about as much and is missing the Mosquito and Ladybug expansions which Carbon and Pocket both include. Jaipur is great as well but it certainly isnt going to offer you the same depth of strategy that Hive will. Its more of a fun pastime than something to really sink your teeth into.. The best fighty game I have is Kemet. Be a god! Raise armies! Sacrifice them when they disappoint you! Its got a ton of action right from the start because your most consistent sources of victory points are starting and winning fights and controlling temples that  oh yeah  your opponents can literally teleport into anytime they want. Plus you get to raise pyramids and eventually summon these guys. I havent gotten too deep with Worker Placement games so the only recommendation Ill throw here is Tzolkin which is a real brainburner. Its probably not the most drippingwiththeme worker placement out there but its not dry and its certainly flavorful and it just looks cool. And its not necessarily fantasy per se but you do make sacrifices to Mayan gods so theres that at least.,boardgames,ckccagm,1,t5_2qmjp

1866990,0,t3_2fyoi1,I found the base game of Dominion alright. It is kind of fun but tends to feel like a solo game there is very little direct player interaction I am aware this is fixed in later expansions but unless you are going all in I would look elsewhere.Legendary is great but I am also a huge Marvel fan and so are my friends who I play with so it tends to hit the table a lot. The game is coop in terms of you either all win or you all lose but it also has a competitive side to it where you all win but whoever has the most points wins the most. I have another friend who plays his copy as purely coop and does not worry about the individual score but myself and my usual group play it pretty competitively which I found makes it a lot more fun. Since if you get to a point where you feel you wont be first you can try throw the game so it forces you to balance letting your allies get strong enough to help but not too strong that they might beat you.I definitely prefer the experience from legendary especially if only comparing the base games.But it all depends on what type of game you are looking for. Dominion is the original deck builder and can be a much simpler experience for new players although marvel itself is also very simple mechanically and calls for a bit more strategy to be better at it.If however you are looking for a competitive game I would really recommend Puzzle Strike. It is essentially the board game version of Gem fighter the street fighter competitive tetris game.For a balanced competitive game I would really recommend this. It plays    players and has pretty simple mechanics but allows for a lot of strategy. There are  different characters who all have different strengths and weaknesses. It is asymmetrical because you start off with the same cash as the other players but your  power chips are unique to your selected character. Also the game uses chips instead of cards so no need for that pesky shuffling just chuck them in the chip bag and shake it around and draw out the chips you need. The game is quicker to set up and pack up the game play is smooth and balanced even with  players there is no picking on a single player as if any player is knocked out the game immediately ends. So in a  player game it often plays out with st place is trying to knock out rd place but nd place is defending him and trying to help them as only fist place would be the winner.You can try it online herei would seriously recommend giving it a try you can play vs ai or vs other people online so it is a decent try for free of the game.Edit Formatting,boardgames,cke5zzy,6,t5_2qmjp

I think it would have been improved by having the bombs be easier to make and worth less points such that it took  to win not .That said I think whoever taught you the game did a poor job of outlining its mechanisms and goals which soured your play. The Manhattan project is not a worker placement game it is a tableauengine building game. As you noticed the spaces on the board are hardly optimal compared to most any building. Your goal is really to build an engine out of the available buildings until it is strong enough to crank out a couple of bombs.

I think CCG is generally used in a more specific way  Heres a link to the wikipedia page  The defining characteristic of a CCG is that you purchase cards in random assortments. For example Uno is a card game but not a CCG.  Android  Netrunner and Dominion are card games that involve deck building but are not CCGs.  Sentinels is a card game but not a deck builder or a CCG.,boardgames,ckgyxcz,7,t5_2qmjp

1905916,0,t3_2gea9a,When I say it I usually mean When a game has better components than it needed to have. The game then costs more than expected because youre paying for components instead of the game in general.Obviously youre always paying for components but theres a price point that people come to expect out of a certain type of game and then one comes along and it costs more because you added tons of crap in the box solely to make it look cooler. And this is not always a bad thing Im perfectly happy as long as I like the game. Caverna is a great example of an overproduced game.

I really liked this game and would like to play it again however the person I played with had all of these little wooden pieces the additional expense of those on top of the regular game is a bit intimidating.,boardgames,ckj8ei3,1,t5_2qmjp
1912665,0,t3_2ggf9c,Old soul new account.Kemet My fourth or fifth play of play Kemet and its starting to really open up. I love how quick the pace of the game is while still allowing for very interesting tactical choices both on the map and in the tech tree. Every game Ive done something wildly different and every game Ive either won or at least never felt like I didnt have a shot at winning. This game is gorgeous on top of it all so I would say this is a mustbuy for anyone interested in moving dudes around on a map.Coup Still a favorite after hundreds of plays every group I introduce this to has a blast. My regular group are all pretty heavyweight drinkers and watching the games change as we get drunker is hilarious. My favorite strategy has been to look at my cards announce what I have and then straightup use characters I dont have. People have only called me once or twice in more than a dozen games but thats probably because were all very drunk by that point.Coup is a game you can enjoy with pretty much anyone at pretty much anytime. If you havent picked this up yet and your group isnt adverse to direct competition and bluffing you should really go out and get a copy right now.Ghost Stories My regular man crew has finally gotten the Initiationlevel difficulty down pat only failing to win once every so often due to really bad luck. We picked up an extra copy of the game with BOTH EXPANSIONS for  TEN GODDAMN DOLLARS so this has hit the table pretty much every week since we started playing weekly about two months ago. The game is beautiful and the challenge is really engaging once you understand how to tackle it. We had to look up some basic strategy for this one and if youre having a hard time enjoying the game I suggest you do the same. Once we had a bit of an idea on what to do we really started enjoying the game.Our boardgame crew just started up DampD th edition so we didnt play much this past week. We made character for DampD got way too drunk at dinner and then played Coup until a pair of us passed out and the remaining four carried on with Kemet and Ghost Stories until am.Two months ago after pretty much never playing any of my vast collection of boardgames ever I decided to form a group with my best friend and go for ten weeks straight of playing rain or shine. Next week will be our th week and weve already doubled the size of our group with more showing interest so not only will we hit our goal but I think we managed to start a legit weekly gaming group in my apartment! Ive never had that sort of thing and its been a blast.Growing up my parents sort of convinced me that games were a waste of time so Ive never put much effort into playing them. Getting this group together and playing regularly was like rediscovering a part of myself that I had let wither away. Thats overly dramatic of course but playing games with all my awesome friends has been super fucking fantastic and I feel stupid for waiting so long to engage with my favorite hobby.tldr Fuck the haters start a games group you wont be sorry.,boardgames,ckjnwox,2,t5_2qmjp

1923667,0,t1_ckkvm02,It looks brilliant but a couple of P hiccups are causing me to do a doubletake on this one which frustrates me a little because... well it looks brilliant! The first is as Rahdo pointed out that with P you need to play pink and blue because DOW didnt include enough of the other colours to play them in a P setup. That just felt ridiculously scrimpy which surprised me given its a DOW game. Its not that I mind playing blue or pink but I like having the option.The second thing also picked up by Rahdo was the turn order mechanism which seems to work fantastically well at P or P but at P it basically means both players get two turns in a row every turn or only one gets that benefit because of bidding which is worse. Back to back turns means youre constantly able to set up a tile for scoring and then youre able score it. It seems like an oversight that breaks the spirit of the game. Ive heard from other people that have played it as P that they didnt really notice this much but I think Id have a hard time ignoring it. Again looks stellar as a  player game but Im still really on the fence about it as a P. Im hoping someone in here has some P experience with it and can debunk me.,boardgames,ckkzl48,3,t5_2qmjp

This game fires on all the right cylinders challenging coop deep mechanics well integrated theme high replay ability with multiple scenarios great components blah blah blah I love this game.  We plug away at a scenario until we pass it before moving on to the next we currently reside in scenario .  It is amazing how different each feels and they keep us coming back for more.  The variable difficulty is also a nice touch with the additionremoval of Friday and Dog.There is randomness but I find it adds rather than detracts from the gameplay.  Always plan for the worst and let yourself be surprised but good results it also adds just the right amount of variability.

What you want is the DampD Starter Set Rules and then download the free Players and Dungeon Masters Basic rules  After getting a feel with the starter and reading the basics play a while then start buying the books Players Handbook E is out.Descent is nothing more than a pit fighting race game it isnt an rpg.  No board game captures and rpg because Board games have finite well defined rules rpgs have a system which allows people to behave outside the rules.  For example Puerto Rico has no rules which cover becoming a privateer to steel goods from the ship and gain gold so you cant do it  if run like and RPG there would be a system for determining how to do this. Board games have well defined winloss conditions rpgs are like life in that the goals of the players are whatever they make up and there is no winning and losing the game.  You may suffer a defeat but you did not lose.  Your character may die but you did not lose.  The game doesnt end it goes until you all decide to stop playing.So yes it is the perfect time to get into DampD right now.  E actually looks like quite a good product one that gets back to its roots of having a simple system for the new comer while having official ways to increase complexity.  The only reason to buy Descent E before roleplaying and trying it is because you want to overpay for miniatures and map tiles youre better off making paper minis and using  square graph paper when learning the game or doing it all in your imagination.,boardgames,ckqjpxt,2,t5_2qmjp

It breathes some new life into the game without adding too much fuss.Figures has some fun additions too  new historical people i.e. figures that can help your civilization and new types of achievements called Decrees.IMHO Im happy to play with just the base game and Echos.   Not that I dont like the Figures expansion but it just seems to add a layer of complexity that isnt always desired.  If we want to just play a quick game well often leave the Figures expansion out.Also the mechanism for knowing which kind of card to draw when using either expansion is kind of a nightmare weve housed ruled it so that we end up just mixing all of the base cards and Echo cards together...I cant remember how we deal with it when we use Figures guess that goes to show you we dont use that expansion all that much!,boardgames,cktfapt,4,t5_2qmjp

But Castle Panic is straight cooperation while Dead Panic is more coopetition.It was a judgment call on whether they were different enough but well thats the call I made. I consciously chose Dead Panic over Munchkin Panic because the former seemed more distinct from Castle Panic than the latter and not everybody is a fan of the Munchkin games.,boardgames,ckukf4e,2,t5_2qmjp

2012388,0,t3_2hr9r2,Hera and Zeus is still my top player game.  Its short enough to play best of  and multiple victory conditions mean a variety of strategies can be pursued.  I also love the tempo management involved.  Having more actions than your opponent is generally an advantage for an aggressive push but if your opponent sets up a defense that can weather the assault you will be stuck with actions you cant spend and lose the endgame.  Many cards have multiple uses and figuring the best way to use them is not always obvious.  Lastly theres a heavy amount of bluffing and feinting.,boardgames,ckvou8j,2,t5_2qmjp

2019226,0,t3_2hvc3e,The old Illuminati game from Steve Jackson Games.  You play shadowy secret societies vying with each other for world domination by building the biggest networks of groups like the IRS the Pentagon the International Communist Conspiracy Hollywood Biker Gangs the Post Office Mad Scientists for a Better Tomorrow that kind of thing.Im playing the Society of Assassins my secret societys special power is Neutralize  I get a big bonus to cut groups off from my opponents network so they become uncontrolled but attack normally if Im trying to control groups myself.Id been hiring myself out to other players as a hitman getting megabucks and flying under the radar  a benefit of Attacks to Neutralize is that while it knocks down a player it doesnt boost me up so people think it makes me less dangerous.Its late in the game and I am sitting on a huge fortune  enough to bankroll a devastating series of attacks enough to make my minuscule network grow to winning size in one turn.  The other players realize that Im one move away from winning so one of them tried to unravel my network of groups by attacking one of my most powerful groups  and he plays an Assassinate card which lets him Neutralize that group pretty easily by keeping me from spending money to protect it.All the other players have banked on him stopping me and it looks like hes set up the perfect counter for my longterm strategy.  I pull out a card and say Do you not see that it is unwise to attempt to assassinate...the Assassins?I play my Secrets Man Was Not Meant To Know card which lets me cancel any card another player has played.  As his pack of assassins has been eaten by tentacled monstrosities from beyond time and space his attack crumbles completely and everyone at the table howls with terror.My turn was next but the game was a foregone conclusion by then.  The timing the theatrics the way everyone responded  it may not have been the craftiest move or the most strategic move but it was certainly my most dramatic move ever.,boardgames,ckwihf6,5,t5_2qmjp

The game isnt super easy though so youll likely need a few tries to beat different chapters. Not sure if youre a video gamer but there are some games that are fun to play through the campaign again with a different classcharacter and some that arent. For me MampM leans towards the not as fun the nd time but then the expansions continue the story.IMO by the time youve beaten the full campaign youll have gotten your s worth from the base set and be ready for both the small expansions and bigbox expansions that continue the story.,boardgames,ckyerot,2,t5_2qmjp

So in this instance youre saying a person needs a specific type of game pretty or some such based only on her gender. It separates you in this example probably a male from her and makes it clear that she needs something special specifically because shes a woman. Which by definition is sexist.

2056763,0,t1_cl170b3,gt The use of slaves is mechanically unnecessary but not thematically unnecessary. Its a part of its source material.Thematically its completely unnecessary. There are plenty of intheme alternatives that could have been used. Slaves in this game are effectively currency. Lots of things could be used as currency in an ancient Arabic themed game.gt The objections are mostly because people dont want to be reminded of something that they dont like however accurate to the source material and historical context it may be and it is accurate on both counts here when they can just as easily ignore that it existed.uwil is the first person Ive seen to explicitly make the currency connection. Maybe someone else made it and I just didnt see it.  I can completely understand not wanting to take glee in human trafficking ingame. There are people who dont want to play games where you destroy things or where you murder people. Same concept in my mind.gt However the use of assassins gets a pass here for some reason despite being nearly identical in its objectionability to slavery.Yeah.

Well we should be fine. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD WERE SURROUNDED. Typically this game starts with everyone sitting around the table casually playing and about halfway through most people are standing up to get a better vantage on the board to figure out how to get through this. The only issue is like in Pandemic if someone has a dominant personality or others arent too into the game it can feel like only one person is playing as they tell everyone else what to do.It has tons of replayability since its mission based with a modular board and comes with  scenarios in the box.All this being said I was able to pick it up on sale on Amazon a while back for around  bucks.

Really looking forward to December when they ship the reprint of War of Indines. Also Pathfinder AVG I wouldnt have said this a month ago but with the class decks that came out there are now a TON of characters to play with. In the base game I got tired of the stock characters but the new ones are alot of fun. There is a necro in the wizard deck and a cleric that later picks up arcane spells in the cleric deck really fun to play thru again with these new ones. A third would be Formula D I only have the basic game and doublesided map yet played a dozen times and have only had this game for a couple months.

What was frustrating to me was that they were super communicative about estimated dates explaining delays etc and then all of a sudden they dropped off the planet. The last they posted on the BGG thread was On the boat will let you know when copies are available then nothing. Even as the game started appearing on the shelves of BampN my FLGS and his distributors had no idea when theyd get the game or how many copies theyd get etc. I was a huge supporter of Pandas decision to include FLGS promo cards in preorders made from actual brick amp mortar stores which is what made it especially disappointing to see them in bigbox stores before FLGS owners even knew when theyd get them.If you dont care about that stuff the games themselves are usually very unique fun and well produced.,boardgames,clgidot,1,t5_2qmjp

2210167,0,t1_clkfm7o,Betrayal is unbalanced the rules are lacking and unclear the combat is dull the number of things to remember is huge its luck based and I LOVE it.Sometimes when the rules allow for some flexibility unclear or edge cases that arent described we usually give the ruling to the side that is losing. Thats the thing about a game with so many variables and cases the rules are going to be tricky to interpret and there will be many cases where you just dont know what happens but its really not that big a deal for us. I try to tailor our groups experience to be as climatic and close as possible by taking role of the unofficial dungeon master to make the decision on some rules as I have the most experience with the game and just try to lead the story down an interesting path. Works out well. There are some people who are put off by the handwaveyness of the rules once the haunt happens but they quickly get what the game is about and focus on the experience rather than trying to win.So yeah.

2267644,0,t3_2l6sda,Lets start with Arkham Horror I love the expansion The Dunwich Horror and feel it is the only must buy for Arkham fans.  It adds injurymadness cards which are amazing new spells and items plus dunwich event cards.  There is a new area which adds a new mechanic which pushes the doom track it is modular so youre not compelled to add every game.  There are also quests which add a new albeit small dimension to the game.   If you want to play more Arkham then this is your starting point.Eldritch Horror is streamlined and a lot of fun but it can clock in as long as Arkham.  I love how well cards and events tie into the AOO solving mysteries makes more thematic sense than just pending clues.  Fiddliness has been tossed to the side and turns are streamlined.  This all comes at a cost to player agency and choice no changeable stats and far less options per turn.  My other complaint is the location cards.  Arkham has events that tie into each local spot and are very specific you might encounter a spectral feast in the witch house or a dark ritual in the Silver Twilight Lodge as examples.  Eldritch is larger scale so the events feel watered down traveling to Arkham might net you a Silver Twilight event or thugs in a street.  There are also more generic locations that will give you a generic event still fun but not as thematic to me.  It is a great game in its own right and feels different than Arkham to me they sit right next to each other on my shelf.,boardgames,cls0133,3,t5_2qmjp

With higher player counts theres less chance of not enough logistics coming out where in a p game its very likely that your only source of logistics is the home tiles.

There were  times that my opponent tried for the Space Race and failed due to that alone.  Very frustrating for them. I like the staging of the game.

2334429,0,t3_2m1d8y,I have been playing BSG for over  years now starting with the base game and getting the Expansions when they came out. For our group it is after uncountable plays one of best games that we have. Each one is different the tension during accusations are among the most thrilling discussions i had in my life and we created moments we would never forget funny moments and mindblowing moves.The game definitely improved in my eyes with each expansion not with every feature included but since you can setup the game anyway you want you can use the ones you like and leave out the others.So i will just tell you which features i personally think are the best and a reason why and which our group doesnt use that often.PegasusThe awesome one The new Crisis cards. Since crisis is one of the key elements of the game for me these cards are the best feature of Pegasus. They are more decision driven than base crisis cards and puts you into positions you not wanna be in decisions you have to explain and to live with. Great atmosphere bonus from those cards!The good ones The Pegasus game Board itself is pretty cool. You can shoot cylon ships without the need of a pilot if you dont have one or dont trust him or if you do support him. Especially the Airlock is a Location that created some of the most memorable moments in the game. Once we had  activations in one round  passed. Casualties  humans The Characters loyalty destination quorum and skill cards for diversity The Dplastic basestars! They are just beautiful and enhance the visual atmosphere greatlyoptional The Treacherydeck is a fun addition but becomes obsolete with Daybreak Cylon leaders are very cool and very very fun to play but their agendasystem is not that good yet. This is also improved in Daybreaknot that good New Caprica. Yes it can have its unforgetable moments Admiral plays best and most loyal human ever during the game only to jump the fleet first round of Galacticas arrival on New Caprica leaving all humans to die but overall if you have played it  or  times you just dont feel the need to come back.here is a great review of pegasus! ExodusThe awesome one The Cylon Fleet Game Board as mentioned above this is probably one of the best if not the best solutions in the expansions to improve the game play. Now you cannot just jump away you get pursued and every kill counts. With the additional ruling of placing the civil ships space areas get crowded and pilots have work to do.The good ones Again the crisis cards. Just so intense! The Characters quorum destination and skill cards for diversity Conflicted loyalty cards especially the final five! Now looking at loyalty cards isnt the nobrainer it has been before. If you want the information it can come with a price just like any other decision in this depressing environment of space. Viper Mark VII. Nuff said The CAG. Great new title for pilots The Cylon Fleet Game Board as mentioned above this is probably one of the best if not the best solutions in the expansions to improve the game play. Now you cannot just jump away you get pursued and every kill counts. With the additional ruling of placing the civil ships space areas get crowded and pilots have work to do. Overall this expansion greatly enhances the importance and dependence of pilots while also improving the atmosphere and paranoia.optional Ally tokens and Crossroads. It is definitely fun to play the Ionian Nebula Objective. This new system with trauma tokens allys and an endphase that throws everything upside down is an intense experience worth trying. We really like it and played it a lot. Alternate Basestar damage tokens. Yes it is good. We prefer it against the old system but it is something one can choose and change from game to gameNot that goodNothingA great Expansionhere is a great review of exodus!DaybreakThe Awesome ones The new treachery deck. Those cards are just so good. In Pegasus when you had to draw a treachery card you just discarded it for ship to ship travel or threw them in skill checks you didnt even try to pass. Now every card is dangerous. Every time you make a skill check you hope there is no treachery in there. Also they are a great tool to control others on the ship be it cylon or even human we had one game where cylons and humans just fought a treachery war The mutiny system. If you get a mutiny card you are halfway in Brig so get rid of it but beware it can come with a price for Galactica. Great new system that further improves the gameplayThe good ones Miracle abilities. OPG become miracle abilities. It is not just a change of wording but now it can be possible to use a OPG again! Demetrius game board and missions. Pretty cool possibilities open up with this new ship both for unrevealed cylons and humans. Hard skill checks with big impacts on the game The Characters new cylon leaders and skill cards for diversity Very cool ones! Motive cards for the cylon leaders. Much better system to check their winning condition. The new crisis cards are also greatOptional Plastic Centurions should have been there in Pegasus already and Assault Raptors Yeah they are cool but i think optional New colonial one. Well it is good. If you play with mutiny you have to take the new one. If not you can choose which one to set upNot that goodNothingThe best of all expansions. Our group has come to the agreement about never ever playing without most of the features given by this expansion foremost the treachery deckAs you can see i just love this game and think every expansion is worth buying if you enjoy playing it.Before you order them all one advice i really meanBuy one after the other!The fleet also didnt just jump from New Caprica to Earth so play along. Buy an expansion play it  or  times and then consider purchasing the next one. This way you will have way more fun and you can try one feature after the other.Because i experienced it that way and think it just matches the pace of the show i would go for. Pegasus gt . Exodus gt . Daybreak as a great conclusionHope i could helpHave funAlyat,boardgames,cm08xv1,5,t5_2qmjp

Quick background we had only played Ticket to Ride and its expansions King of Toyko Golf and Phase  until trying this version of Agricola. The instructions were a little confusing and not very detailed about actual game play but we ended up finding a vid going through the turns and how to play.We have about  games under our belts at this point with almost even wins and losses. Some are blowouts but most are within . points  of each other average scores of . We are constantly approaching the game differently both by trying to explore other ways to win or by having our hands forced for us by the others moves. We can see how this game is designed for just  players and is optimized to make each decision an important one.Its balance and back and forth take during a round make it fast paced enough to be fun yet not so fast paced that we cant just lazily play the game while enjoying a few beverages. The pieces and the boards are quality and the price was about right for us around  off amazon.Our arsenal of games is growing but Agricola ACBaS is our go to for a nice quiet fun filled evening.,boardgames,cm3sjlr,3,t5_2qmjp

2423085,0,t3_2n6nra,I think this comes down to the question of whether Game A has fired Game B for you. I know some folks for instance who feel like Caverna does everything that Agricola does except better so they would only want to play Caverna in the future.For me I feel this way about Star Realms compared to Ascension. I always preferred Dominion over Ascension but I recognize that they are different games in Dominion you can plan out a strategy from the start based on the available cards in Ascension you have to adapt somewhat to the cards that come up. But I feel like Star Realms and Ascension occupy the same fun space to me and since I like Star Realms better I dont expect that Ill want to play Ascension again.So Star Realms fired Ascension for me so I wont play Ascension. However Star Realms is different enough from Dominion that depending on my mood I might prefer to play Dominion or I might prefer Star Realms.,boardgames,cmb79pr,1,t5_2qmjp
2424095,0,t1_cm9i4y6,Well its somewhat meaningless to see a single card with the original rules too. You never really know anything by seeing one card. The wide range of possibilities and more challenging puzzle of not even knowing how many people are on your team is why we designed it the way we did but I completely understand you wanting the teams to be balanced. The first expansion Bombers and Traitors will launch on Kickstarter in January and add two additional roles that will really help even out the odds for the team with fewer numbers... especially the Traitor. No one wants to kill a leader until any Traitors have been found which gives the minority team time to do some damage to their opposing leader. Plus players can claim that someone is a BomberTraitor to buy time for their side. I really think youll like it. ,boardgames,cmbbqvr,1,t5_2qmjp

In Risk Legacy you can add coins to cards to make them more valuable and there are four of them out to select from but you must control that territory to take that card or youre stuck just taking an ordinary coin card. If that makes sense.When you take a card you take another from the deck to replace it. If it has an even value   or  coins on it an event happens. There are other event cards that are added when you open other packs of course. Packs are opened when conditions are met someone wins for the second time someone manages to get  armies in a turn that sort of thing.This enough or should I go into spoiler territory?,boardgames,cmd3fkv,2,t5_2qmjp

Im doing a terrible job explaining it but it is a hit with every word game fan I introduce to it. Also a less portable but different direction from the other games mentioned Blokus.

2470833,0,t3_2nuq5c,Finally got a chance to play some of the games Ive been stockpiling lately. Age of War is a game I just picked up I was looking for a light push your luck dice game and I think this fits that perfectly.  Its pretty good for such a simple game though I can see it getting too long if people attack each others towns and stop conquering the pile.Indigo was another recent purchase.  I have been looking at Tsuro for a while as a good light game to play with my kid and wife but it looks almost too simple and Tsuro of the Seas seemed like a clunky way to add more game to it.  I think Indigo did a good job of taking that path laying mechanic and adding enough strategy to it to make a more replayable game.  It still feels simple but it was fun and thats all I really care about in my games.Red was a game I kept hearing about in all the reviews and videos from BGG CON.  After hearing so much I thought I would give it a go.  I was pleasantly surprised I get the comparisons to a game like Fluxx but this seems a bit more strategic in your hand management.  Many times I lost a round because I played two cards per turn.  The quick rounds is another benefit for me like Love Letter you can play a few rounds and count up the points when you dont want to play anymore so the game doesnt overstay its welcome.Lords of Waterdeep I bought a while ago and havent had a chance to play until last week.  I liked the game It is my first worker placement game and I know its not the best one but I had a good time playing it.  I like the dungeons and dragons theme.  I love how simple the game was to explain to everyone.

2490305,0,t3_2o4egk,Catan full Settlers is a different beast than Rivals p in that the mechanics are different and gameplay is different. The only common elements are that they are both games where you settle new lands and make the best of your situation. Settlers uses a die locationhex assignments and a common board while Rivals uses randomly drawn cards some of which yield resources and a hand which you can play from. There is card trading in Settlers while there isnt in Rivals which does alter the balance and fundamental mode of play IMHO. Now there is a lot of luck in both and they are largely tactical based games on the tacticsstrategy spectrum. I personally dont play Settlers much and I didnt really like Rivals but Ive heard people liking one over the other usually Rivals is more liked. ymmv best of luck.,boardgames,cmjmdd2,1,t5_2qmjp

Is he looking for something more casual and quick or a lengthy and complex experience?

Caverna I have fewer plays on and it seems a bit cleaner than Agricola but I personally am not in love with it.   Wonders is a good drafting game and a bad tableau builder.  I love Glory to Rome and when I see a card game with a tableau that you build on I hold it to that standard.

2575036,0,t1_cmugnyx,When I was in college I learned a  player version of Rook with similar partner rules.  card deck standard   joker  rook. Deal  to each player   in the center face down. Bid points in increments of  minimum .  If you pass youre out of the auction. High bid takes the  center cards amp puts  from their combined hand back in the center.  Usually the goal is to void yourself of some suit so you can trump in. High bid names trump suit no trump or low no trump no trump but lowest card wins the trick. High bid names the partner card.  Common statements are things like Spades are trump partner has the ace Hearts are trump partner has the ace of clubs No trump partner has the rook etc. Only the partner knows who is the partner.  Everyone else including bid winner doesnt know although it will usually become obvious via giving point cards to the bid winner or when the partner card is played Rook always counts as the lowest card of whatever suit trump is.  In no trump the Rook is the only card in a th suit and is still trump. Points are taken from cards taken in each trick count at the end of the hand    pts     pts   K  pts   A  pts   Rook  pts   Total possible points   per suit   for the Rook Whoever takes the last trick also takes points from cards in the center. If the bid winner  partner take at least the bid  of points they score the bid amount otherwise they score negative the bid amount. Defending players score points for the tricks they take individually. Play to  points or whatever score you want.This is the best  player game I know.

2597416,0,t1_cmxm3jg,Youre the second person who has replied to me that has used the car analogy. The analogy is flawed because the k table and the .k table perform exactly the same in function unlike the Ford and the Ferrari. Would you pay Ferrari prices for a Ford with a body kit? Because thats what the k table is. Ill also add a personal anecdote that Ive seen an Amishmade table much nicer than anything GC makes for a fraction of the cost. It was better designed too as it was able to expand and retract and store the leaves inside the table when it retracted. People should be aware that there are more choices than GC. ,boardgames,cmxmaw8,7,t5_2qmjp

2599307,0,t3_2pkpr3,I think the term gateway game is in and of itself a problem. What is a good gateway game depends on who you are trying to bring into the hobby. Its far more important that you can get them excited about the game than it is that the game is any sort of gateway. Sure simple mechanics are a HUGE help but not necessary. For the right person even Mage Knight can be a gateway game.SoC is usually a bad gateway game because its theme is boring to  of the population and it has a lot of edge cases and fiddly rules that make it hard to teach someone.

2606403,0,t1_cmyravd,That makes sense.  Its a hard one to really get across.  For me the amount of money my friends will spend on a dinner out seems obscene and dont get me started on how much people spend on a car especially a new luxury car. I dont drive.When I first discovered Geek Chic a few years ago I also thought they were outrageously expensive but then I started taking my place more seriously  and thought about the furniture Ive gone through since college.  I started shopping for a hardwood table among other things. After realizing how much Id be spending for a table Id hardly use and wasnt impressed with I kept comparing every one I looked at to Geek Chic tables. I dont have kids I have a small condo and  I play a lot of boardgames.So thats where my mindset was when I finally got the chance to see them in person again. This time a year later they really didnt seem that much more expensive.  I was already going to spend a lot of money on a dining room table so then I thought  is it worth paying about double that for a game table and dining room table that fits in the same space? Also its super cool.Id been to a lot of shops at this point.  Designer furniture stores a trip to actual Amish country I even considered a few antiques as options because the wood Id been seeing just didnt match up with my expectations now. When I thought of a cool table these are what I thought about.Dont underestimate what people will pay for cool...you may think its ridiculous but how many people will pay s of thousands of dollars extra for a slightly cooler car that they will have for what  years? ?My tables going to be fought over by my relatives after Im dead.,boardgames,cmyslv1,1,t5_2qmjp

When people say there isnt enough interaction in Dominion they often mean that they want more direct conflict.  But it sounds like you dont like conflict?  The attacks in Dominion can be painful and yes sometimes they cause slogs.  But slogs arent the case with every attack or even most attacks and Dominion is designed to avoid politics.  Attacks try to hit every other player equally.  I dont see how they make the game unfun for others any more than games like Kemet or Keyflower which are two of my favourites.

2671996,0,t3_2qlzt9,I love this game. It will take longer to play than you think it will. Id suggest only playing with four players and take out the recommended cards for a shorter game the first time you play.You score points with Glaciation Wanderlust and Domination actions some Dominance cards and the Survival card. Points for the Glaciation and Wanderlust actions are based on the bonus point system. Domination scores based on number of cubes on the tile but dominance who gets to pick the card is based on matching resources on that tile and number of cubes doesnt matter as long as you have at least one there.The greatest point swing happens at the end of the game when the ice age card is chosen and then after the last survival phase when all tiles score once. Try to get all your cubes out before the end. Remember that its often good to be in second and third place on a tile as youll get points and whoever is in first will likely use an action to score it for you.,boardgames,cn7cpgn,4,t5_2qmjp

2678371,0,t3_2qp3hg,Are you playing in tournaments or just for fun? The way it works is that each character has  cards per set and each time you get one of their cards you get one of their dice. ALL DICE FOR A CHARACTER ARE THE SAME. Even with the nd set some characters got new cards and new dice colors but the dice faces are the same.  Starter sets have  cards and  dice for the  characters so those are actually the rarest dice so characters who are starters in only one set have the rarest dice. But none of the dice are rare.  Almost every character has a maximum of  dice per player.  So you only need  dice per character or  if you want to run your own  player games with both sides being able to run the same character. If you buy a starter and a case of the first set you will be about  dice short of  per character and probably missing   of the  super rare cards  of the rares and a few uncommons. If you buy a starter and a case of the second set you will be about  dice short of  per character and probably missing  of the  super rare cards half of the rares and  uncommon. Dice are between . and . each online and can probably be picked up for free if you have anyone to trade with.  The cards can be collectible priced BUT UNLESS YOU ARE PLAYING TOURNAMENTS THEY CAN BE EASILY PROXIED.  The cards do no get shuffled into decks.  The card backs do not matter.  You can print copies or draw your own. If you really want to do it on a budget you can pick up two starter sets and a few common sets on Ebay possibly with an uncommon set and handful of extra dice and just proxy all the rares and super rares. Basically if youre playing for fun dont let the collectible aspect stop you. ,boardgames,cn86mt4,1,t5_2qmjp

2683934,0,t1_cn8ppdo,I implemented a pointsranks.achievements system for my gaming club in . Its still running today and you can view the page hereThe system is currently play games get points because for a group of over  gamers and a wide age of ranges it was simply too difficult to track achievements without coding skills which I lack. The system does encourage people to play more games with more people and to come back to the club year on year which were two important goals.With  people achievements are quite trackable and Id recommend consider the behaviours you want to encourage and build the achievements around those. So winning may not need an achievement especially if you use the points system where you get more points for a win.For achievement tracking I would suggest giving people a game card where they can track what games they play and who they play against.Colourcode the cards so people with full cards replace those with a different colour.Game cards can start with a simple trackers for games and people played. Additional cards can have goals on them then relate to the achievements such as teach people a game.,boardgames,cn8ws41,4,t5_2qmjp

2689066,0,t1_cn9jo4k,Theres a few reasons why I do it. I like to know how often certain games get played.  This can help me decide if a game is worth keeping or trading.  If its not getting many plays why?  Maybe it doesnt need to be in my collection.. If someone in my group misses a game night they can look at my BGG log and see what they missed.  Likewise if I miss a night I can look at someone elses page.. I also use it as a way to remember obscure games that I play.  There are a couple with very obscure names that I can never remember let alone spell if I could remember.  Now I can just consult the log.. Its fun!  Kinda like getting achievements in video games.

Although we spend every evening on Skype with the occasional video game Ive been coming to the realization that board games are something really special in my life Ive wanted to include her in the hobby.This year she graduated and waiting for her applications to go through and I switched jobs myself and now although things are a little tighter financially as life changes we have time to play games together. The best thing was taking part in our new FLGS first Pokemon TCG event us two in the final match.

I hope that it doesnt become stale after  plays. . Eldritch Horror We played this one a lot last year and we havent begun to scratch the surface on the number of interesting modules and ways to play. I think this one is ambitious but I have my game group on board so it can happen. . Russian Railroads My favorite worker placement game ever. I think getting  plays of this will be easy. . Caverna the Cave Farmers Probably one of the longer games on the list I hope to try a bunch of different strategies over this next year. . Istanbul A neat worker displacement game that I played at Gen Con. The board changes to add extra challenges so that could be fun to see over  games. . Five Tribes Another worker displacement game Ive played it a bunch already in . I hope it holds up over another  plays. . Star Wars Imperial Assault This one has a bunch of different modules and scenarios so keeping it fresh wont be an issue. I might have to teach this one a lot though. . Sentinels of the Multiverse With a large number of villains a new expansion and tons of heroes to chose from  plays of Sentinels shouldnt be hard to do. . King of New York Its more strategic than King of Tokyo and more fun for my group of gamers. I think I can knock out  plays of this game in the first  months!  Ticket to Ride Its a classic game that I dont play often enough in person. The iPad app is good but nothing compares to playing with real people. Plus I can try out some of my favorite maps and expansions!I think my list is somewhat ambitious but doable. Ill come back with a victorious post when Ive completed it!,boardgames,cnadfma,3,t5_2qmjp

Sounds simple but its deep and fun and often challenging. The game is easily expanded for more options heroes and quests and the theme is done amazingly well. Another card game you might consider is the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game PACG. There are two core sets out Rise of the Runelords which centers on fairly traditional fantasy adventuring such as goblins and zombies and the like and the more recent Skull amp Shackles wherein players find themselves as pirates doing piratical things .... arrrrr!Unless the pirate theme is undesirable Skull amp Shackles has an improved production value and the edges of the game and its system are smoothed out a bit better than Rise of the Runelords.

It takes a special type of people to be able to play this way and remain friends.If they get on the receiving end of cheating it might change their stance on the issue? If they are bad enough to have to cheat at normal games and still get caught I kinda imagine they lack the skills to competently cheat. Personally I got the point of being really good at cheating in munchkin. The trick is just talking fast and having quick fingers on drawing cards.

2797954,0,t1_cnlyktl,This is the first one Ive ever done but Ill explain how I did it. I was inspired by this Love Letter theme but knew I couldnt pull off something that nice. My friends had been playing Coup a lot recently and I found a lot of GoT rethemes that were character based but I liked the idea of doing one based on Houses. I found some high resolution desktop backgrounds for the house emblems which made the house cards very easy. In Photoshop I made a new file at dpi or dots per inch anything under  will look pixelated when printing the size of a Magic card . x .. I just sized each image with a pixel border and saved it off as a tiff. The instruction card is where all the time went sizing out a grid and rewriting the terms in a more GoTtheme over a lowopacity westeros map. I also cut out the emblems from the cards and used them here. Once everything looked good I sized them all on a . x  page and had  copies printed at the local Kinkos on llb card stock. I used their instore cutter to cut them all down to size. Then I slide each inside a Dragon Shield card protector with an old Magic card for extra weight Grey for instruction cards and Black for house cards. Ive played it a few times now and plays really well so far. Still using standard cardboard coup coins but have some real metal ones coming.,boardgames,cnm487u,4,t5_2qmjp

Ghost StoriesAn honourable mention goes to Pandemic however once you solve the puzzle to Pandemic it becomes way too easy.  Buying the expansions raises the complexity however eventually youll solve that one too and itll become easy again.  I havent tried the In The Lab box yet but On the Brink probably added about another  games worth of entertainment.  Its a good game and all  just it has a limited shelf life.

2865255,0,t1_cnto41p,I want to start by saying your opinion is completely valid. In fact I held the same opinion which is why I was convinced it wouldnt get as many plays as it has. However I want to give my opinion on your comment just in case you were wondering what all the fuss is about. For reference Ive taught the game to approx.  people amp logged around  plays in the last year amp a half.Ill use  player Resistance as my example as its the most common player count for my group.  At first yes it does seem like its just wild accusations thrown around at random but we kept playing with mostly the same group amp that changed drastically.  For instance with  players the first amp third mission only have  two people going on the mission amp its extremely risky to fail so usually it goes first mission passes second fails third passes amp now the fourthfifth missions is where the real game begins.  If the spies had any say in the second mission that means that one spy was on the mission amp one wasnt to prevent a double fail. meaning one of the three is a spy amp one of the two people that didnt go on the mission is a spy then its time to go back to the missions is there a general rule that most follow that wasnt followed this time just for fun? Anything weird with the voting?  Its somewhat safe to assume the leader of mission  or  is a spy if youre in this situation but you cant be positive. After playing for a while the spies get pretty good at hiding these tells meaning you have to take an educated guess at the fourth mission usually guessing wrong amp heading to mission  using the same kind of logic amp having the new info from the fourth mission amp consider the fact that the guy picking the group for the fourth mission could be a spy.  Then the spies will mess with convention purposely choosing both to go on the missions taking more risk but almost guaranteeing a victory if they can pull off the nonverbal communication without giving themselves away failing one of the two person missions passing the second mission they are on etc.amp then table talk the fun of the game is trying to figure out who is lying having that gut feeling that something is just slightly off about a player amp going with it to amazing or disastrous results. Going with it amp assuming that person is a spy then paying attention to who she takes on a mission with them you can assume one of the two people that werent picked were spies basically its taking educated guesses that build on top of each other when youre right you feel like a genius when youre wrong you.. dont.  amp thats just on the resistance side being a spy is just as fun deciding when to give up missions faking distrust against the other spy or a resistance member successfully framing a good guy etc. This is just using the base game amp  players going to  changes things drastically amp usually with  or  we throw in MerlinAssassin I just got the kickstarter so havent tried any of the other variants.  Ive actually had much more success with people that werent hardcore gamers as they usually are fans of well hardcore games minmaxing creating an engine properly allocating resources to edge out a victory amp while I love that as well this flexes very different muscles amp some people just dont like lying there is certainly nothing wrong with that.,boardgames,cnts3ha,8,t5_2qmjp

Its the simplest game youll ever play draw a card play a card but has surprising depth for a game that consists solely of  cards. Its probably my girlfriends second favorite game.Jaipur is also great. Simple and strategic. Its indirectly competitive like Ticket to Ride not like Tokyo or Small World so youre trying to build your score faster than your opponent can.Finally  Wonders. Its my girlfriends favorite game by far. Most people recommend against the  player variant but we love it. It takes a couple games to learn if youre playing  player  which is called the expert variant but its a great game.

While Ive been playing it for a couple years now Ive really only just begun my obsession with it and I expect it will be my most played for . For other games it looks like Pandemic The Cure and One Night Werewolf are in the lead for now. Likely due to how easy they are to get to the table.

2887954,0,t1_cnwcuxm,Ill start by saying you are correct that the game can never go back to a zero state however that is part of the point.  Once  games have been played the board becomes static and no longer changes however it is almost guaranteed to be unique a board that plays differently from any other version of risk out there.If you wish to play on that board with a totally new group there are multiple strategies that have been brought up in this thread like assigning bonuses to attributes instead of names like the person with the longest hair or oldest person alternatively you could play so that no one has any nukes or bonuses associated with specific people and you would still have differentiators in the factions that people get to choose.Also to clear up the level umpteen shadow knight vs lvl .  Each faction is not tied to a person and different factions have different strengths that are carried over to whoever plays them some are more offensive some are defensive some are mobility etc.  The nuke component is just one facet of the game and if someone has zero nukes they start with a bonus victory point which is rather substantial and I personally feel that the strength of nukes is being overplayed a little in this thread.,boardgames,cnwd3gz,2,t5_2qmjp

GtR is probably slightly less good for two players more aggressive play and more extravagant card effects crazier combos cards that end or win the game immediately that sort of thing.Theyre both absolute top tier modern card games.As for Star Realms.. I know this isnt the most popular opinion but I think its mediocre. As a deckbuilder it throws out a lot of the stuff that made Dominion work. The games economy is deliberately broken and there are no action restrictions causing it to snowball hard and have a short playtime and feeling of escalating power. Unfortunately its also super random as a result and once you know all the cards doesnt take long it starts to feel samey and like it plays itself. The praise it gets for feeling more interactive is also overblown  thats mostly thematic not mechanical and Id say its less interactive than Glory to Rome for sure.Ultimately Id much rather play one game of rftg or GtR than two games of Star Realms.,boardgames,cnx4gru,3,t5_2qmjp

2913925,0,t3_2tig75,I think the dice mechanic used here is really great. Its a little bit of luck combined with smart resource use to control your engine direction. Plus I really love rolling dice. I enjoy CoB but its not one of my favorites. The artwork is really bad with a completely unappealing color scheme. Nothing about how the game looks is going to draw people in to it. The iconography is also difficult for new people to pick up you get it eventually but the first few games have a lot of rule book consulting especially with the yellow tiles. I also find the variety of point scoring to be fairly meaningless in the end. Games between players of equal experience always tend to be close to the point where various strategies all lead to the same end point. In that respect its certainly balanced but I never get the idea that you can really screw up your game.CoB occupies an odd space for me its not simple enough to be an introductory game and not complicated enough to be one that I want to keep going back to.,boardgames,cnzbkan,8,t5_2qmjp

2920942,0,t1_co01qje,I am well aware of determinism and my whole argument is based on the fact that it is beneficial to strategy but it is not the same thing. Strategy is your ability to plan ahead while determinism is knowing the consequences for your actions absolutely.If a game allows you to compensate for randomness then it can remain strategic. However if I can win or lose because of luck then it is not. The whole point of a strategy game is that the outcome is decided by good planning and execution. Having the outcome influenced instead by random chance is anathema. To use your chess example if I get a checkmate but then roll a  how was my loss due to bad strategy? To use your poker example if I am dealt a Royal Flush how is my victory due to good strategy? I had absolutely no control over either result and they were not strategic. Even if the entire game doesnt rest on the outcome of a given event if that outcome is decided by random chance then it is obviously not being decided by strategic planning and the strategic value of the entire game is thus hurt. Lets imagine another chess variant where instead of the die roll at the end we have a die roll each time you capture a piece and on a roll of  you actually lose your piece and theirs remains. The majority of the moves in the game would still end up like normal and we may consider the game on whole to still be fairly strategic but the fact that I occasionally lose a piece regardless of my good planning and making good decisions would certainly make it less so. I may occasionally even lose to a worse player due to bad die rolls.Strategy is a plan for victory. Strategy Games are games that are won by good planning and execution. If the game can be won due to random chance then it was not won due to good planning and execution and thus is not entirely strategic. Now if the game is still won the majority of the time due to strategy most people would still call it a strategy game as the title is somewhat subjective but if it is won too often by random chance then it would surely lose that title. That is how luck detracts from strategy.,boardgames,co04bzv,1,t5_2qmjp

2943532,0,t1_co2oiql,Honestly the game looks good from what little I have seen of it. The fact that he has made other games makes little difference to me. The biggest problem isnt the quality but the convenience. If I were to back this game Id be waiting over a year to get my game. If I buy one on Amazon Ill have it by the end of this week. There are plenty of games that are already out that I want so there really isnt motive to back a kickstarter for me. The other issue I have with kickstarter is the chance of failure. Not that he is any less reliable then I am. The truth is I could get cancer or my house could burn down tomorrow. If that happened to me my focus would be so far from kickstarter that Id be surprised if it gets fulfilled. I wouldnt blame someone for failing a kickstarter under those circumstances but Id still be out of my money. If he has a booth at Gencon Id be interested in trying a demo of his game and maybe purchasing it then. If not I might buy one when it is available on Amazon if the reviews look good.

2943838,0,t3_2tunpi,So like other posts have said getting the board games would be the smallest concern here.  The real things youll have to worry about are food and drink costs.If youve never run a restaurant of any sort before start by working in the industry or training in the industry somehow.  Its a very unique beast in that you need to know how to handle fresh food that expires quickly and how to manage it in bulk.  This can eat in to your profits significantly without proper training but can also be the largest part of your income if done correctly.Youll also need to worry about general ownership and maintenance.  Youll want to rent or buy a location which will require immediate construction costs.  Afterwards youll have your furniture and bills.I saw someone mention a possible startup cost of k and I think thats probably a pretty fair estimate  .  But if you dont know how to run the place it will flounder.So back to my original point make sure you have experience in managing in the food industry more than anything.  The board game piece is more just how youll draw customers.  This is all assuming you are actually interested in opening one and not just sheer curiosity.  Otherwise good luck!  ,boardgames,co2q7h0,8,t5_2qmjp

There are a few cards you can play to effect your opponent but the main way to do it is by an effect from visiting an age or changing the time upstream from them to bump them somewhere. The issue we had with this though is that those two methods were usually as bad for you as they were your opponent. Example we had police state out and many opportunities came up to trap the other guy there to slow him down. Unfortunately age three was the only place we could play cards so by changing the stream to police state you couldnt play any cards unless you wanted to get stuck there too. It actually almost seemed at times like we were cooperating because our interests lined up so closely. Its a very odd game. ,boardgames,co792fk,1,t5_2qmjp

His favorite game is Seasons... which is weird XDThe showoff  Rarely wins because hes more likely to get off topics with whats happening at his job. Usually prefers board over cards games. Really big fan of LCG though.. No real favorite game.The wild one  Hes waaaayyyyy toooooo muuuuch into the game but hes the one whos having the most fun. Terrible at coop games because thoses are still very fun with him. Favorite game by far is Space Cadets as the helmsman and Lords Of Waterdeep.The Quiet one  Wins a lot usually quiet while gaming unless the game requires a bit more negociation. No favorite game and is open to play a lot of games.The Alpha one  He likes to win and hates to lose. He does not like coop because he cant be the only one winner. He loves games where theres conquering war and conflicts. Favorite game would Clash Of Cultures or TI.Me  I bring the games. I explain the rules. As a gamer im a bit off topic sometimes and rarely wins but Im a good loser and I enjoy almost every games if theres a good vibe through out the night .

You might be right that most indies sell a few hundred but indies imply self published often via kickstarter. Established mid level fantasy flight to small publishers do not do great marketing and self published even less just because of its nature.

The score was  after the first two missions and I was holding the plot card that allowed me to look at a played mission card.For the third mission which requires four people on a team in a game with  resistance members D outed himself as a spy by voting for a team not including himself although that team didnt actually go. Eventually the team of A B C and E got approved. Knowing one of them was a spy I made a big deal about how I was going to use the card starting a big discussion about who I should investigate. I picked C because he wasnt mentioned as a suspected spy by anyone I figured that one of the suspects would be likely to throw a success. I saw his success card announced it to everyone and then watched four success cards come up.So now everyone probably thinks I look bad and C gets his hands on another one of those plot cards for the next mission. I suggest that I scared the actual spy into passing the mission teams got rejected and then C chose a team of himself A and me and chooses to look at As card. A is the actual spy and plays a fail so naturally C tells everyone. Eventually in the fifth round I became the leader after two rejected proposals and picked the perfect team correctly guessing that C told the truth about A.,boardgames,cocwn4z,1,t5_2qmjp

To play the game to think about the game to frame what you want to say in an interesting and useful way and then to produce it in a reasonably professionalpresentable way.  If people like what you make and find it helpful and useful you will prosper.  And thats basically it.  Thats the golden ticket.

So Im wondering how legal is it to set predetermined hand management?  For example when my brother was teaching us he told us that the left most card in our hand other peoples right was our discard slot if we are ever going to discard to discard from that slot.  This allows us to know when we needed to clue about a card in that spot if we knew we couldnt lose it.  He also explained that the rightmost card in our hand other peoples left was our play spot.

Lords of Waterdeep has to be one of my favorites with or without the expansion. I do tend to win a lot when we play but its a game Id have fun either way. The same with Ascension and all expansions. Puerto Rico I rarely win but enjoy it whenever its the choice to play.

3111290,0,t3_2vrz2b,This is a tough call as always try before you buy. There are people who absolutely swear by games like Agricola and Puerto Rico as the best games ever made. My group does not. As one player described Puerto Rico as fun as making a spread sheet. Its a matter of personal taste playing style and what your group is into.Personally I really like Caverna and prefer it to Agricola. Caverna is a chill build your machine worker placement game  and it will play up to  players though that many is a long slow day. It is low in direct interaction but very open ended on how you build. Agricola is tense the starving mechanic can get cut throat and a poor draw of the cards can cripple inexperienced players. In the end my wife will play Caverna not Agricola.That said I bought it when it was on sale for   I waited for a price drop and grabbed it in December. I would no pay  for it.IF you have that money to spend as others have said go grab a couple of other things for now.

3144981,0,t3_2w5mzg,I only like Citadels with exactly  players. Some people like it with less so your mileage may vary. Also with  you have to use one of the alternate lesser properties rules or it starts to feel repetitive. Also it is primarily a bluffing game with a little extra on top of it. With that in mind it is much closer to poker by feel than the other games you have listed as your preference. My other half hates this game because we read each other too well. Even with all the second guessing whoever goes first winds up with a huge advantage and it is better for the second player to just take the roles randomly. This is why it works better with . Some people like it but it just doesnt work for us. It is pretty light overall so it would fit your bill. There are stronger and more modern bluffing games out there such as Coup or The Resistance which can scratch that itch.Race for the Galaxy is quite good. I prefer this one with  but  or  players works too. The base game feels quite a bit more like solitaire and some of the expansions additional mechanics are wonky even if the extra cards are great. It will feel similarish to Puerto Rico but really closer to San Juan if youve played that. Though I think it is generally a better game with a more interesting theme not that the theme is very strong in any of those. It has a bit of a learning curve so dont expect it to be fun right out of the box. Dominion is also a great game. It works great with two players. Some cards are more powerful with more and some give stronger direct action with less. Its a great game on its own and the expansions all add a lot of variety without the weirdness that RFTG has. You will see some people suggest getting Intrigue alone and I would advise against that. I did that off a suggestion here and mostly because other friends had the base game. And even though it works fine on its own after playing it a while I really missed the base cards. The good news is that you can get one of the big boxes that bypasses Intrigue thereafter and have that many more options. It is what I wound up doing.Of those I think you would get the most mileage out of Dominion with RFTG in second and Citadels a much more situational type of game. ,boardgames,conz2zf,1,t5_2qmjp

Something about its puzzley nature feels less like youre playing and more like youre figuring out.I love Pandemic The Cure. The dice are fantastic. Push your luck is exciting.  I love those moments where Im teaching the game and a player will look at me and ask me if they should roll again. I simply smile and explain what could go wrong and what could go right and let them decide.  There is still room for QBng but I find it much less of an issue than I do with Pandemic Flashpoint Forbidden Island etc.You have to like dice to like The Cure.

3152394,0,t1_coon2s4,Hey AdamIn the case of people looking for recommendations both of these options are valid and my advice in these situations is to present users with ish questions then ask them more questions or provide them some updates then let them dive further.  So for each of these options.... is probably too many options but you definitely want the most important.  People will have different things that are important to them but the most important things that I can remember were... Time to play and learn  of players Luck vs. Strategy Coop vs. FFA vs. Teams Cost range Maaaaaybe genreFrom there you can ask for more specific information if relevant like digging into genre or how much luckstrategy..This is a good idea and if you can let them pick a few of their favorites even better.  Then if they can tell you why they like these you can make a good recommendation.  Basically Id suggest letting them see some results quickly and having them make small choices to hook them in.

3158141,0,t3_2wb9yb,My FLGS is actually a combination of store and board game cafe which pretty much rocks.  Theyve got quite a few different ways that they provide discountsloyalty points.The first is that if you purchase a membership to the place the overall cost is much much cheaper.  For instance its like  an hour or  for the whole day.  But if you pay  you can get a monthly pass.   for a yearly pass.  As you can see if you go there frequently it saves a ton of money to get on some sort of pass.Next is their loyalty rewards program.  For every dollar you spend you get a point.  There are various awards that you can use but one of the ones I enjoy the most is that if you spend  points or some such you can get a free day pass which is nice if youre bringing a group as you can get them in free if you have enough points.  Also after you accumulate  points you get a free drink with every visit.  With  points you get  off all instore purchases.  It works out really really nicely and has saved me a decent amount.Also if you host events like say DMing a game etc. you can ask for a sign up sheet.  For person hour that is played you get a point.  What I mean by that is lets say youre DMing a  hour game for  people at the end youll earn  points.  Its a nice way to encourage the community aspect and so forth.Anyway the place is called Game Paradise and if you find yourself in Indianapolis you should definitely stop by its great!,boardgames,copc7ur,1,t5_2qmjp

3163215,0,t1_copuo80,Its very different. Id say the only similarity is the fact that both have limited roundsturns so theres a lite tension to do as much as you can with the time you have. And while both Agricola and Glass Road have tableau building theyre distinctly different styles. There are direct interactions between the various tiles you place which Agricola lacks for the most part. The bits that will sell a group on the Glass Road are the action selection mechanic and the automatic machine mechanism that your glassworks and brickworks uses. Even  games in Im still discovering subtle techniques. ,boardgames,copv6hy,2,t5_2qmjp

You then move your  nowoutbid meeples on to another tile with a starting bid of  to repeat this process.I think this is the hallmark of the meanness in this game  its not just that you can block actions or take tiles people want its that the whole time youre jockeying to try and force people to pay three times as much for anything they want just because you can.,boardgames,cor03ob,1,t5_2qmjp

3177207,0,t3_2wioa8,This is copied and pasted from another thread I posted inCheck out Anomia. Its a fantastic game that takes a few minutes to play but can easily be played more than once. The description of the game makes it sound boring essentially you just play one card in front of you at a time. Each card has a symbol and a category. If your symbol matches somebody elses you have to give an example of something in their category before they do and then you win their card.The categories will just be things like TV Show or Country but you would have no idea how funny it is when under the pressure of the game someone shouts out FOOT when presented with the category Animal that lives in the sea. You freeze up and panic and it makes the game super fun.Two things to note if you play this game every couple of weeks replayability wont be a problem youll forget what was said the last time you played especially when under intense time pressure. You can also replay it making repeats of words illegal. On top of that we invented a house rule to play with occasionally where you had to pick a word starting with a certain letter or one of a certain set of letters. This isnt quite as good but it mixes things up and introduces a new and different sense of panic. Anyway especially as its just a cheap filler game Id highly recommend it for the amount of fun you can have with it. Ive never had people wanting to play it all night but if people do then that can only be testament to its brilliance! ,boardgames,corbe9n,3,t5_2qmjp

3188799,0,t3_2wlv70,The point of this mechanic is to fix the mechanic of execution from Pegasus. In Pegasus you could execute someone post sleeper then they could come back and be completely cleared of suspicion. With the extra card the executed person shuffles another not a Cylon and picks one of the two. So there is still a chance that they are cylon. Frankly it was a needed fix for the Pegasus execution problem. But without that problem in the first place it seems to be fixing a problem that doesnt exist. ,boardgames,cosioxp,1,t5_2qmjp
3189501,0,t3_2wnsbh,Weve only played the tutorial so far but everyone really enjoyed it.  If you are going to be playing with the same set of players it should be really good.

3189574,0,t3_2wndoo,First I would rather not playing with the designer and not let them explain the rules assuming theyre written down. That way you can play the game as written not as intended there shouldnt be any discrepancy between the two in a final product. I would dispute unclear rules as if the designer werent present. This will expose any unclear rules and areas of potential abuse. Remember if its published the rest of us arent going to be able to consult with the creator over vague rules or broken scenarios.Second I dont think its ever too early to look for ways to break the game. Some broken mechanics can be patched with a single line in a rule book while other issues with core mechanics may need a complete overhaul to rebalance everything. The game I created had a problem with the endgame trigger it just never happened so I had to look at everything as a whole to fix it. Also take note if a certain position has an advantage or disadvantage and if there is anything to balance first player in Catan has a huge advantage since they get to take the best settlement location but this is often balanced by the fact that their first road may be useless and their second settlement is usually not great. Finally have fun with it. I play tested a game that was fine mechanically but wasnt fun and would be an okay filler game at best given length and style. Also if the style of game or theme isnt your thing let the designer know. Theres a difference between I didnt like it and I didnt care for it but I usually dont like resource management games.,boardgames,coslkz2,4,t5_2qmjp

3251602,0,t3_2xcfx1,I taught ESL at a university in China and THE best game I played with my students was plainold mafia at the time I didnt know about Werewolf and the Resistance games werent around yet. I personally prefer games like the Resistance that dont require a moderator but having a moderator in an ESL classroom allows you to lead the game at first model but then allows your more advanced students who are more comfortable speaking to speak more as the moderator. Its something everyone can work towards. Something to consider. In general negotiation to keep playing or to win is such a great motivator in this setting. So I would definitely recommend Avalon Resistance or even an older Werewolf game.From what I know about Sheriff of Nottingham I havent played it that would be a really good fit too.Cooperative games would also be very good in this setting so Pandemic or something along those lines. If your students arent as comfortable speaking something like Hanabi could be good since its all about sharing clues and the clues can be very repetitive you have two blue cards etc.. Depending on the level of your students that could be a plus or minus.My last recommendation would be to have your students teach and play games they already love card games or anything really in English! Have fun. Teaching ESL is a great gig.,boardgames,coz1dom,1,t5_2qmjp

3256013,0,t3_2xe9lf,You here the opinions against it because it is so popular.  Suppose every game has . of people that dislike the game vs  who like it and the remaining . who play it are indifferent.Lets take an average game that might see  copies printed and sold. That means there are  people who like it and  dislike it.Now lets look at Catan  which has sold over  million copies  Lets be extremely conservative and say  million of those are duplicate products and so forth and say  million are only base games.  That means there are  people who like your game and  who dont.Given  vs  who dont like your game  which opinion do you think will work its way to social networks?  Which do you think will be discussed in game shops?So I dislike Catan.  Is it because it is popular?  Not at all  but the fact you hear my opinion is because it is popular.  I dislike it because I dont like games that basically say the real way to win this game is to both get luck with how the dice roll and then use your own skill at negotiating with people to get what you need to win.  Unlike chess it is not how I play by the rules of the game that wins it  its me convincing you that my trade is better for you than for me.  There are issues with preexisting relationships why piss off the person you have to go home and sleep with or make a family member cross at you over a stranger and if I am going to play a fuzzy norule game Id rather play a tabletop RPG.  You know what game rolling dice and negotiating trades while building stuff reminds me of?  Yup.  Monopoly.  A game I also dislike because I suck at schmoozing and making deals and because I am often the outsider who people would rather avoid trading with.Am I mad that other games arent as popular?  Nope not at all.  Id rather see games be popular in general.  Im happy if people play monopoly and so on.  I know people say why play an old bad game like Monopoly when there are so many better choices  but Catan the original game is now about  years old.  It is not really the most modern of the modern board gaming games.  It is actually getting quite old now  and as such just as Monopoly may have better mechanic games out there that have replaced it I am sure Catan also has better mechanic games that have come out in the last  years to replace it.However it sound like you like the game and guess what?  Thats great!  Im happy for you.  Happy gaming with one of the most popular board games to come out in the last  years!,boardgames,cozhw0c,1,t5_2qmjp
3259870,0,t3_2xemw2,Another thing to look at is the concepts the game represents. And this is a mix of theme and mechanic but it can be more than either.A game like Chaos in the Old World has dark concepts that are very tightly linked to its theme.But a game like Concept is thematically suitable for kids and mechanically its suitable for kids place tokens on the board to hint at the thing on your card isnt super sophisticated but the concept of Concept is very mature. Kids arent going to be ready to make the leaps of logic and do the abstract thinking required to be good at the more difficult answers and they are unlikely to look past the very literal suggested meanings for the different symbols.One could argue that that makes it adult mechanics but I hold that its the sophisticated use of a child mechanic.,boardgames,cozwaks,2,t5_2qmjp

What a shame its out of print in the US. Stellar design full of tough choices. Council of Verona Played this for the first time with the upcoming Corruption expansion. Really didnt see what the big deal is about this game. Id like to try again with just the base game but Id much rather play Love Letter at the moment. Muse Played this numerous times with  and  players and its a great filler game. Very enjoyable and easy to play several games in a row. Felinia Love the D boats in the game. Like the mechanisms in the game. The catpeople theme is odd. But in the end there isnt enough of a narrative arc to support the length of the game. You just do the same thing over and over again and it just lasts a bit too long. Adventure Time Card Wars Finn vs. Jake Im not a CCG gamer but my wife loves Adventure Time so I thought perhaps the theme of this game might be enough to dip into this style of gameplay. It wasnt. I just dont like headtohead battle games and she didnt either. Oh well at least that episode of the show was fun. Tales amp Games The Hare amp the Tortoise Really fun little racing game. Ive only played it with  but Id like to play it with more. Vampire Empire Interesting deduction game. You really have to economical with your cards because if you run out before your opponent you will lose the game as I found out. Didnt resonate enough to want to keep it and now its on my trade list. Diner One of the Dice Hate Me Games rabbitsized games that recently came out. Super frenetic fun. Not the best with  but really shines with more. Pay Dirt This game is dull as the dirt youre sifting through to find gold. Not sure if the publisher or the designer is to blame as I find it hard to believe the designer of Alien Frontiers would design this. What a disappointment. On my trade list now. AquaSphere Loved it. Like most Feld games it sounds complex at the beginning of the game but everything just fits together well and flows nicely. Cant wait to play this one again. The Climbers Really neat D spacial game about trying to be the highest player at the end of the game. Just OK with  but shines with more. Diamonsters Played with  and its just fundamentally broken with that number. Theres never a reason to play anything but a  or a . Pretty much a brainless game at any player count but it would be good for laughs with  or  players at the pub. Sky Tango A surprisingly vicious game for such a pretty game. Its interesting how players can choose to be aggressive and mess up other players skies or play nice and only work on their own sky. But at some point youll probably have to screw someone over. Would like to play a couple more times before I pass final judgement. Trxx Interesting game of drawing a continuous line through colored hexes in an effort to hit numbers before opponents so you can get more points. More of an activity than a game. But I do find it fascinating that there were a number of games released recently that used dry erase markers. Agricola All Creatures Big and Small Delightful little game. I can see the complaints about the game feeling samey with just the base game though since the same buildings are always used. Seems like the expansions are a must for this game. Pie Factory Another Dice Hate Me Games rabbit. This one was decent but a little weak with  players. Probably shines with more. Some annoying production errors on the cards. Mow Absolutely pointless with  players. At best a pub game with a large group. Brew Crafters The Travel Card Game I havent played the published version of Brew Crafters yet so I cant compare the card game to the board game. But the card game was very satisfying.

3280564,0,t1_cp270gi,It sounds like you just favor WP games. I personally dont think any mechanic is better or worse than another full stop  it just depends on the design goals of the game.For example I just dont agree that the only way to give decisions weight is to make players compete for them  for one thing theres the classic turn angst of too many things I want to do not enough actions in which to do them largely a balance thing. Or you could have them require currency  theres a lot of ways to give decisions weight both interactive and solitary.And while the spending of action points without competing for them is more solitary than competing for actions that has little to do with whether or not the game on the whole is a solitary or interactive experience. Some WPs have no player interaction other than the worker placement element and end up feeling pretty light on interaction as a result while some AP games are highly interactive  either by presenting you with actions that affect other players or having other systems that encouragerequire interaction.For example in Survive Escape From Atlantis you get a certain amount of movement points AP per turn but you can use some to move boats with other players in them or move empty boats away from other players. Ontop of that theres other systems in place to encourage interaction moving sea creatures around to eat each other removing land tiles out from under each other. Highly interactive but players are not competing for the actions themselves. Or any game in which you use actions to affect some kind of shared board where you can block each other etc.,boardgames,cp27lqs,1,t5_2qmjp

3291495,0,t1_cp3fnum,I think its because you still have to be skilled to use the pieces you bought.The paytowin stigma comes from the fact that some freetoplay games dont know how to monetize particularly well and it leads to situations where the paying user is statistically more powerful rather than having more options.My only experience with miniatures games is XWing another FFG game. They placed a pair of very powerful cards in one of their most expensive expansions. However there are dozens of ships that dont need the card to be effective.I guess the real question is could you build a combat effective squad only using the base game?With XWing the answer is no. But you can build a combat effective squad for  which is about retail for Imperial Assault.,boardgames,cp3ggng,4,t5_2qmjp

3294237,0,t1_cp3r68r,Oh my friend I have all of those games lol.deep breath inVillage is awesome! The theme is so fun and the game tells a really neat story as you play. Its not really a worker placement game its more of an action selection or a worker removal game. You pick up cubes off of various action spaces to do that action. Once all those cubes are gone then the space is used up for the round. Eventually once the village chronicle is filled with stories of the villagers who have died the game ends and you add up points. My partner and I love it. It has fallen a bit flat with a couple of people who think its too Euroy but most everyone Ive played it with likes it too. Viticulture is a recent pickup and oh man is it good. Its pure worker placement without any bells and whistles. Put a guy here to get this and turn it into that for points etc. The theme comes through in every aspect of the game and the production values are wonderful. Its probably my new go to gateway worker placement game over Stone Age barely. Weve played it I think  or  times in the month since we got it. I will say that the Tuscany expansion box will up the replayability immensely. Like I said its very straight forward and pure worker placement so a bit of a shake up is good once you get the hang of the game. So far weve been mixing and matching some of the Tier  expansion modules from Tuscany into the base game and were really enjoying them. Looking forward to trying them all. Last Will is probably the one I would recommend the least. Its a really good game but Ive played it probably four times and it just hasnt made it back to the table in a while. Its really funny and tells a great story while you try to go broke but its just not quite the greatest game out there. I think you can kind of tell a round or two before the game is over who is going to win. To get back to a tableau builder I also highly recommend Legacy the Testament of Duke de Crecy. Im not really sure about the availability on this one but its a wonderful worker placementtableau builder where you are creating a family tree across  generations. The most prestigious family wins.

Even when the paintings are not really comparable its clear to me that Coimbra has a deeper understanding of light color anatomy perspective shape and texture at least in terms of realism and a general school of art.

3310135,0,t1_cp5koo2,That presents a whole new set of problems. First and foremost only silver bullets kill werewolves by most lore and there are none in the game without adding custom item cards. Second werewolves are WAY more formidable on an individual basis so just using an action die for an automatic kill doesnt make nearly as much sense as it does with zombies whose power is in numbers not strength. Thirdly Ive never seen werewolf fiction with more than a few werewolves. The number of enemies wouldnt make sense and the whole game would have to change to fit the new theme. Lastly if someone doesnt like the zombie theme Im not sure werewolves would be much better unless theyre railing against zombies just to go against whats popular.,boardgames,cp5kzwq,1,t5_2qmjp

I also agree with everyone that refers to it more as an experience than a hardcore strategy game.

3424559,0,t3_2zfdzv,I live in an apartment with some of my mates and the simple but quick games are what we thrive on.We love King of Tokyo and more recently Bang! The Dice Game. These are both dice chucking games where youre blasting apart your opponent.We also really like Smallworld it fills that void that Risk does but ends in an hour it is simpler to play and is just... awesome. Very competitive as well. That would be my first suggestion!After you warm them up with Smallworld you can introduce them to things like TTR amp Power Grid. The former may seem childish but once they start appreciating boardgames more they will be way more open to it. Likewise once theyve had a taste something like Power Grid will be an easier sell.I imagine your group likes Star Wars and maybe even Star Trek. The attack wingxwing miniature games are actually really playable out of the box for  players. These will probably be a bit longer. Playing in teams is a lot of fun too. This is a stretch but it might work! I tried attack wing and my roommates went out and bought their own ships and everything.

SO finds the themes cheeky and we both play munchkin together and also with some very light casual groups who get a huge kick out of it.  minutes is the longest its ever taken us. No kingmaking going on here. We laugh drink snack take that to players and then play something afterwards. Its a broke game and can grow thin and long but I have a love for this game as it brought me into the hobby. House rule it if needed for length. It can be long but I still oddly enjoy it. I mean Im not a light player considering I just finished a game of eclipse at the game group followed by brew crafters finishing at  am. Munchkin just amuses me and I take it for what it is. My other friends have done some odd house rule variants which is to add dice to lvl  players and those throwing shit at them and to set rolls equal to hit and defense to what goes through and what doesnt. They also award points for gear and levelstop the game after  minutes and score. They also set a time limit at the start of the game and try to grab shared victorystill scoring for vp at the end.

We took out almost all of the cards that allow you to find the gold because those were just very overpowered. I think we just left one. We also changed the rules about how the damaged works I dont remember what its actually called in game. But we decided that any fix can heal any damage. So if you have a broken lantern is then you can use a fixed pickaxe etc.  we also made it so that the saboteurs get  more card than the dwarves. The way we did this was as soon as the group guessed who a saboteur was The Saboteur immediately got  more cards. sometimes this happened right away sometimes it happen mid game. It all depend on how the particular saboteur wanted to play his game. I think thats everything we changed but my game is packed up right now so I cant check Edit oh! We also changed it so that there was always the max number of saboteurs in each game instead of the  or whatever lol. And that one fix could cure all damages.,boardgames,cprsb19,5,t5_2qmjp

3526550,0,t3_30oayw,Because its one of the few games that gets better with more plays. When you start memorizing some of the cards primarily early war cards which doesnt take long the game loses most of its randomness.The game has very little luck. About the only major luck element in the game is the coup rolls. The shared deck makes the game very well balanced  if you draw a bad hand that means your opponent will draw a bad hand to balance it out. Same goes for good hands.The game is extremely strategic and tactical with constantly shifting threats depending upon what scoring cards are left in the deck and what your opponent is doing.Make sure youre getting all the rules right. I know the first time I played it I didnt realize that if I played an opponents card for the ops I had to do the event.

Its a very chill game but you still make meaningful decisions and can block people out if you like.Samurai Spirit x   Another first play and I really dont know that Ill be looking to play it again. Its a lot like Ghost Stories but I didnt feel like there were as many choices or chances to mitigate bad luck. There were a lot of situations were one bad card draw wouldve cost the game or at least knock someone out and there was nothing we couldve done about it. I really dont see any reason to play this if you have access to Ghost Stories.Cosmic Encounter x   Another first play and the group really had a blast. We started with just the green aliens no flare or tech cards and then added the flare cards in the second game. I definitely understand all the hype and acclaim for this and I cant wait to play it in the future trying out the yellow and red aliens as well as the tech cards.

So you really need Actions AND a good engine Cards or something like Golem. If you can lean out your deck enough you might be able to outpost to get two discards from one turn but thats a big if.That said itd combo so very nicely with Hunting Party since you end up with only one type of treasure and only one kind of terminal at a time.

3554229,0,t1_cpxe0sl,My point was to cut the role a lot to balance it against the other roles and make it strategic. Having a role that gets to mirror the most useful role on the table where you need it most is basically going to break the game. By tying it to another character you gain the power but subtly handicap another player.Most Pandemic roles are useful only at best rd of the time. Scientist exercises her ability twice per game really and is useful mainly in end game. Researcher has to chase people around and cant shuttle cards because she can only give. Ops Expert is a great card but only acts a few times and once the research stations are built becomes less useful. Quarantine specialist is locked to your hot zones. Medic only really helps if you have at least two cubes in a city. Dispatcher can only move pawns not take their actions.However with any good play your version of the Intern gets to use the most useful role on the table as needed. This is without considering that he can have bonus actions. Thats why it feels super over powered and needs a pretty hard nerf to make it fit the others. You can handicap the role in a bunch of different ways but you should handicap it somehow.,boardgames,cpxemdu,2,t5_2qmjp

3556831,0,t1_cpxmk80,In  unlikely creatures vied for a girls attention while humanitys most terrible literature to date forced intelligent adults to weep. Where once there stood many great literary characters in teenage minds there then stood only two. The world had scant moments to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks but by teenage girls and social media neck beards and bronys the confused and people who really should know better. Twilight Struggle is a twoplayer game simulating the four book dance of intrigue prestige and occasional flares of acceptable narration between team Edward and team Jacob. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to win a rather boring girls heart. The game begins amidst the ruins of the US Education system as the two opposing creatures scramble over the wreckage thats referred to as Bella and ends in  with Team Edward winning and Team Jacob having to explain why Jacob creepily has a baby for a soul mate.Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the carddriven classics We the People and Hannibal Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quickplaying lowcomplexity game in that tradition. The game map is a map of Forks whereon players move characters and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their team. As with GMTs other carddriven games decisionmaking is a challenge how to best use ones cards and units given consistently limited resources?Twilight Struggles Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of fictional happenings from stopping car crashes to sparkling in sunlight with the ever present possibility of a gameending murder suicide as the players try to comprehend what is going on.A deluxe edition to be published in  includes the following changes from the basic gameMounted map with revised graphicsTwo doublethick counter sheets with  countersDeck of  event cards increased from Revised rules and player aid cardsRevised at start setup and text change for card  Were not really WerewolvesUpgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the followingMounted Map with revised graphicsNew card decksUpdated Rules amp ChartsThere are also the deluxe mounted map and deluxe eurostyle countersheet upgrades.Components full colour counters  in the  Deluxe editionx full colour cardboard map mounted map with revised graphics in the  Deluxe edition event cards  in the  Deluxe edition sixsided dice page rulebook full colour player aid cardsTIME SCALE approx.  chapters per turnMAP SCALE Pointtopoint systemUNIT SCALE Influence markersNUMBER OF PLAYERS ,boardgames,cpxpb24,6,t5_2qmjp

For example you might try Dominion to see if you like deck builders Stone Age or Lords of Waterdeep to experience worker placement Chinatown for negotiation Sushi Go for drafting San Juan for role selection and so on... Once you know what elements or mechanisms you like most in these simpler games you can get recommendations for more involved games which give you more of that.

That being said my current scores are notably higher than my early scores and easy isnt necessarily a bad thing for our group either. The theme probably bumps it up a spot or two for me but I dont think that the gaming public will remember this a year or two from now. Our group will still be rockin it though.

3664741,0,t1_cq9kbed,To offer a contrary strategy to thisAlmost never reserve cards. Doing so is insanely inefficient. Focus on colors that will match  of e noble cards and take  gems per turn whenever you arent buying anything. Take  if you really really need them and take a gold plus reserve if its an emergency. For example I would probably only reserve a card if I were the only one my opponent could afford that he needs in order to get a noble. Likewise maybe its the only one you could afford after getting a gold that you require in order to get a noble. Think of each nontake action as having a cost for example taking  gold has a cost of  gems. Taking  gems of the same color is going to cost you  gem. Do that repeatedly and your opponent will simply have more things than you because theyve taken far more gems. ,boardgames,cqa0767,3,t5_2qmjp

There will even be some games being played after the discussion.The panel is being hosted by Ben McKenzie a game designer for Pop Up Playground as well as a member  of the teams responsible for the improvised adventure show Dungeon Crawl and the comedy audio series Night Terrace.

If you move to a location then search it a number of times and the card triggers on movement youve let yourself complete a number of other helpful actions before suffering the potential consequences of the Crossroads card. You could do it but it seems to really cut down a core part of the game.

3694976,0,t1_cqdf2xx,I played Resistance with a friend with the strategy of voting down practically every single mission. He spent more time teasing out as much info as possible from voting patterns so he could infer intent. This dragged the game on and made it difficult to determine his intent. The problem is he was right. Everyone took on the same strategy and there was almost no data to pick out. ONUW on the other hand is solvable. You can have these eureka moments where the wealth of possible solutions comes down to just a handful of manageable ones. And everyone at the table has their own independent puzzle theyre working on all with the same solution but different data. As someone who loves logic puzzles I adore ONUW for this reason. ,boardgames,cqdg9y0,1,t5_2qmjp

3740408,0,t3_338yjj,I must admit my first thought on seeing this thread was a discussion on EvolutionSticking to the actual point of discussion I think one of the real reasons why Board Games persist and are gaining popularity during a continuously evolving video game age is two factors.  First board games allow you to tangibly feel the aspects of gameplay.  Placing a piece of wood rolling dice holding a grip of cards or even flicking a spinner is a great feeling.  I love the feel and look of quality components unique to each board game.Second is the social aspect.  Being in the same room with other people to play a game is a great experience.  Board gaming is one of the unique mediums capable of bringing about social interaction on a meaningful level.  Even multiplayer video games pale in comparison due to visualizing the person as an avatar the anonymity of the internet and the fact that the persons gaming with you can be engaged doing other things at the same time you are online.Board games are about enjoying an experience in person with the people around you laughing  enjoying the gameplay together and carrying out actual intimate human interaction with others that you just cant acquire through digital means.  So no matter how much tech our board games acquire I dont really think anything will drastically change.  ,boardgames,cqimq6m,7,t5_2qmjp

Part of preparing for a Kickstarter campaign is doing the legwork to identify manufacturers and that includes identifying which manufacturers will make sense at what size of a production run.So for example for the last campaign I ran which succeeded and fulfilled ahead of schedule we had a half dozen or so possible vendors identified for each of the components up front.

I dont consider sitting in front of a camera for an hour and talking is hard work.None of that means that theres no edits. Theres work done at the beginning of the video between each pick on the list and at the end of the video.gtif the content of your video is made useless by someone posting a short list your content isnt very good.Youre missing the point. Someone posting the lists cant make this content useless because theres more to the video than the three lists.

3875891,0,t3_34u6aa,What youre asking for I would say is rather difficult unfortunately. But maybe I can at least give one option.It only plays two players but can be finished rather quickly once players are used to the game. Its LOTR The Confrontation. Its a stratego style game where one player is the Fellowship and the other player is Sauron. Each character is hidden from the other player and their powers are relatively thematic. Its a small quick little game with just enough strategy and theme to scratch that LOTR itch.Unfortunately the only other LOTR games I know of are either complex LCGs which I love the LCG btw.The War of the Ring nd edition would be the best for die hard fans and anyone who likes war games. It is quite a beast to tackle. The Battle of Five Armies game which is based on the same system is supposed to be a little easier to comprehend. Again any LOTR fans would love the game and then anyone who enjoys a good tactical game would enjoy it as well. Outside of that Im not sure.Hope this helps a bit.

Ive only played Dead of Winter once and we lost without there even being a Betrayer so I had mixed first timer feelings about it. It seems to me like its the kind of game you either love immediately because its exactly your thing or you have to give it time to grow on you because its so beautifully designed. The components and artwork are impressive to work with.Ill throw two other suggestions your way. Theyre both semicoop.Spector Ops  its been getting a lot of buzz and I was gifted it for my birthday a couple weeks ago and its already seen like  playthroughs.  Hunter players track and attempt to take down  unseen Agent player before the Agent destroys  out of  targets and then escapes.aaaaaaandCO  another birthday gift that has dominated the table since I opened it. You play against other players to develop clean energy technologies and build the greenest power plants to help cut down pollution. Meanwhile the CO levels in the atmosphere need to be monitored and reacted to efficiently because if the get too high its game over for everyone and no one wins.

3957672,0,t1_cr7cjio,I havent played Arkham Horror but I know its a very complex game and would be difficult to let them know every rule.However I did a quick internet search and found this video which seemed to be pretty good from about minute  until a little before the min mark. I watched until about min but it seemed to be getting too specific so I stopped. The whole video may be very useful though. Not having played Im not the best judge. The problem? Lovecraftian Horrors.How to stop them? Typically by sealing the gates. Only bring up fighting if at that point in time it looks like you would have to fight them. If not discuss it after the game as something that could happen in future games.The turn order? Upkeep  Movement Mythos. I watched the video then waited about min to see how much I retained. I did not retain  P. Then briefly explain what happens in each phase.I would tell them that dice rolls will come up and only succeed on  and  and stats pertain to how many dice you roll higher stat higher chance of success and give a specific example Jennifer has  Fight but only  Will so shes better at Fight checks but still stands a chance with Will. Then send them on their way. It seems like most of the rest of the game could be taught and understood as you play and things come up situationally.But of course like I said I havent played the game and dont know how well I could with the two minutes of video I watched. Though I feel like my knowledge of Elder Signs helped me understand and retain a bit more. YMMV but it seems a good place to start imo.

If youve got a Toaster playing so soft that theyre acting as a human then yeah thats bad for team Cylon but theres so many ways an unrevealed Cylon can ruin the humans day.    Everything form a Cylon Admiral picking a terrible destination Lions Head etc to sandbagging checks no spiking to executions directly before their turn think Helena suggesting a brig throwing down all her Ld cards and then executing the player to her right... devastating etc etc etc...    Personally I find that sort of thing interesting and I havent had a boring game of BSG yet... always comes down to one last human push before the Cylons turn a last desperate FTL pull or a final check to survive to a known jump with the Cylon Leader desperately trying to weigh their input on the pass by card.

The betrayers objectives usually mean hording cards so if youre a player with a bunch of cards youre getting exiled  even if you did nothing wrong. And especially if you have the hammer position where you can easily force  morale in one go. If you have a procolony objective that needs cards you have an almost impossible time of it in our group. I d say you dont have to randomly do it at the start. Betrayers will play nice for a while and they cant risk getting exiled and their objective changing.

My favorite set is Realms Unraveled mixed with the Dawn of Champions set it is even better.My least favorite deck builder happens to be Dominion. Its just too bland.

Conditions must be met to declare a winner but that does not make it cooperative or semicooperative.

Games like Cosmic Encounter where factions can be created allowing multiple people to group together for a simultaneous win. Games like CO where the game has a loss condition that can be triggered for all players.  This implies that the players will play cooperatively.  That is not entirely correct.  This can also allow some players to play a pressyourluck game where they leave the others to do the dirty work.  There should be two different words describing these concepts.

So no combat during movement which slowed the game down and during the Encounter phase everyone is doing something either fighting or adventuring.Theyve also locked the character skills so no more fiddling with that.

Of course this game is a huge sized ticket that cost  and most people ignore the seemingly complicated but not really rules printed on the back  they just scratch off the ticket to reveal the  letter code to see how much they won if they one or ask the guy to scan it for a prize.

Leaders and Cites each add one card played per round... before and during respectively.    gt Are any necessary?    Nope but they add a ton to the game without adding too much playtime.

I havent played Babel or gotten the standalone Wonder pack... didnt appeal to my gaming tastes.    gt How does this play at  player counts?  ...interaction? Particularly do the expansions well EXPAND upon this at all?  It plays fine but what youll find is folks will have zero interaction with players three seats away... theyre essentially playing a separate game.  Cities does a bit to mitigate these with its coin crack cards.    gt how much of card interactions do you need to know to strategize effectively?    Not a ton.  But to compete for st place it is supremely helpful.  But folks will learn quite quick the game is shockingly simple at its core.    gt wonders  big deal little deal? Anything UNDERpowered?

4235577,0,t3_39edpk,I am not a scientist butThis is cool but I question the real world impact of having dice that arent perfect.The water is showing density.  The die is more dense on one side less on another so it consistently floats with one side up.  But it doesnt matter how much of a difference in density we are talking about.  Any difference in density even minor ones will cause one side to float up.  The difference in density which we can call weight for this discussion may have no effect whatsoever on the rolls but when floating will look very pronounced.  This is one variable and it looks dramatic but we dont roll dice in water so other variables come into play.Rolling dice also has a randomized starting side they are shaken up rolling speed imperfections in the rolling surface friction and in the case of using a tray or a dice tower there is a wall that further randomizes the die.  For a die to be bad it would have to be shown that its imbalance is great enough to overcome these other factors.  And even if we assume the difference in density on the die is enough to skew the results of die rolls we would need to know how much it is being skewed.  In a full campaign you might roll your ds a few hundred times.  At that number you wouldnt be able to tell the difference between an imbalanced die and a fully random die unless the die was so imbalanced as to be misshapen or intentionally tampered with.  tldr  cool demonstration but for gaming purposes even these unbalanced ds are random and there is no evidence you will see a difference in the number of die rolls you do.  Testing you die in saltwater is fun but it is just an illusion of control.,boardgames,cs31mj9,30,t5_2qmjp

4243026,0,t3_39hpkv,The guys over at The Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast did a fantastic podcast episode on Betrayal at House on the Hill and as an added bonus their RPG segment is solely about how to effectively set the ambiance and setting for horror games. One of their suggestions for the game is reading only the beginning of cards that require you to roll checks and then reading only the wording for the number you rolled. Thinking about putting on that creepy mask you found? In a horror story you wouldnt know what would happen you would simply choose whether or not to put it on. When my wife and I play we use this rule extensively and it adds a huge amount to the feeling of horror in the game. Another thing we do is we create the story as we play. One of our characters explored separate from the group to show how brave he was only to come running back scared when he saw phantom footprints moving towards him. For the rest of the game he stuck with at least one person at all times when possible. This didnt add to the strategy but it was great for creating the story we were playing through. These might not be the suggestions you were looking for but I hope they help!,boardgames,cs3w9gu,1,t5_2qmjp

4247998,0,t1_cs4faol,. He made a joke. And it was funny. Im sorry you found it was worth taking umbrage to.. Im not saying there should be solutions but there should be some actual discourse involved. When Tom is criticizing a game hes at least criticizing the contents of that game and articulating what does or does not work well. Thats useful information. A long game can be good if it spends that time well. Criticizing the Top  videos length is the equivalent of criticizing the games length without taking off the shrink and stating Games shouldnt take  hours. I get it. Some people dont want to take the time to play a  hour game. Some people dont have time to watch a  minute video. But Im not going to go around and tell people that they are trying to waste my time for having that stuff... Ill just... not play it or not watch it. Im not going to write Christian T. Peterson or make a review of TI and rant about how long it takes to play  when Im never going to play it. He already knows how long it takes to play. He made it.

I absolutely love Resident Evil deck Builder but the problem I noticed the more and more I played it is you can just hang back and build your deck to perfection and outlast everyone else.

First by penalizing you when you dont go into the mansion forcing to consistently go in even when you may not have a great hand.

Baseball Highlights  I picked up a copy of this at Origins and boy am I glad I did. I realized after we played I got a rule or two wrong but this has the potential to be my new favorite light twoplayer game.  Biblios I was pretty surprised by this game  I bought a copy on a whim after Rahdo gave it a thumbs up and its pretty cool. Lots of game in a small box. Questions Have you ever played a game that got really hyped by your group of people only for it to fall completely flat with you? If so what was the game?  Alhambra. Right after the Alhambra TableTop episode aired some friends wanted to try it so I snagged a copy in trade. Played it twice with two different groups and it fell completely flat both times. Have you ever played a game reluctantly thinking youd hate it only to find out you loved it? Again if so what game was it and why? Mage Knight. I impulse bought a copy when the first edition was drying up and learned quickly that it was way way heavier than anything Id ever played before. I got turned off by the rules after a read through but now its now one of my favorite games of all time. ,boardgames,cs7fqzc,3,t5_2qmjp

4286506,1,t1_cs8s7us,What is a game if not competitive?A noncompetitive game is simply play. Not that play is in and of itself bad. Play is good. But play is not the same as a game. The distinction is what makes a LARP different from watching yearolds playing pretend. In a LARP there are established rules that govern play even if the competition element is loose or nonexistent  if youre a spell caster you dont suddenly say I HAVE A BROADSWORD NOW AND I CUT YOU IN HALF. But yearolds playing pretend can do that  at one point youre a cop then youre a robber now were all dinosaurs but youre an astronaut and were chasing after you and the floor is lava except where Im standing.Fluxx is this thing that tries to go both ways. There are rules which are temporary and arbitrary. And a win condition. So its almost a game and almost play. Its not fully play because whatever cards are down establish rules.

If your goal is to teach good storytelling Id recommend Universalis Microscope or Kingdom as they reward turns that cause other players to react and build on each other.  They are also GMless cooperative systems so there is less risk of a competitive player alienating others.Some of the other systems mentioned OUaT Munchausen etc encourage saying anything that can be woven in.

4302580,0,t3_3a65bf,The two expansions are A feast for Crows a  player varient and a Dance with Dragons  player varient.A feast for Crows changes the game completely you are now focused on completing secret objectives to gain  objective points as opposed to just going for  castles. It adds a lot of balance to the  player varient as the vanilla four player varient is just plain broken unless you play with your own variations i.e rumble in the south or rumble in the north.A dance with dragons give each house new starting positions and a brand new set of house cards for each house. The house cards are fecking awesome and some are insanely cut throat! I love the Dane with dragons expansion as it starts the game off with everyone directly in battle with each other. Diplomacy is more vital in this expansion and really refreshes the game a lot.

It is entirely possible that they could do something that sinks the game...no more cards being made no more packs being bought value of collectibles goes the way of the beanie baby...But let me play devils advocate for a moment Magic The Gathering is a great game all on its own. Yes part of what makes it great is that it is constantly evolving which compliments and enhances the trading card feature of the game. But even if you take those features away you are still left with a very strong and fun game that could stand the test of time.As an example I stopped collecting MTG when Urzas Destiny came out...but when my childhood friends I used to play with come over well still occasionally dust off our old decks and have a grand ole time.Who knows?

4385658,0,t3_3b67vb,This is a case where Im going to recommend Dead of Winter A Crossroads Game.  Why?First you have a group goal where players must contribute resources to accomplish but these may come into conflict with secret private objectives that will make players not want to contribute.  Do you risk losing the game to ensure the rest of your group has a shot at winning or do you sabotage the group effort because if I cant win then I dont care about the rest of the group.Second it has a traitor mechanic.  In this case there may not be a traitor in a game session at all maybe someone is lying about their ability to contribute to group challenges or doing odd actions because they are a traitor but maybe they are doing so because they are merely trying to achieve a personal objective.Those two elements combined make it an excellent study in group dynamics and moral choice.   Someone has mentioned Battlestar Galactica also which is another good choice  but I believe that one always has Cylons in it.  There was also a recent post I read either here or on BGG about a player in Resistance or other social game like it where he put his SO in tears because he lied too well and put the team building player under so much stress that he sucked the fun out of the game for her.  Thus these games can also be considered a game of moral choices.,boardgames,csk00ms,1,t5_2qmjp

Just be careful with Amazon  yes they do deliver to Australia but it depends on the seller. Keep an eye out for items that are shipped from and sold by Amazon. These items generally ship to Australia and will be standard shipping rates from Amazon. You can get items from sellers using Amazon and as a general rule the shipping sucks. Also be mindful of the exchange rate. Right now with our dollar weak Im avoiding Amazon as by the time you add shipping there is nothing in it and your better off getting the item locally and paying a bit more. Once the dollar comes up the story changes especially if you buy about  games at a time.Also keep an eye on CoolStuff.inc as Ive managed to score some great specials and even with shipping still been miles in front. For example I picked up the latest printing of Polis for  and about  bucks postage for two copies shared postage with a mate and got a great game for  bucks or about that.

4408343,0,t3_3bi49z,I bought Battlestar Galactica since its on sale at BampN and when we played it kinda fell flat. Ive seen many reviews on how good this game is and we like the same type of that game like Resistance or One Night Ultimate Werewolf for this one didnt seem as fun. And this was probably for a couple of reasons.One I didnt explain the game clearly. None of us including me have played the game before. I read the rulebook but I dont think I explained the strategy all too well. And also it seems like the objective is to jump but theres no action you can really to progress your jump. You just gotta hope you draw the crisis that progresses your jump. So then what are you supposed to do for your action then?Because of reason one our Cylon didnt do a good job being a Cylon. What is the strategy for a Cylon? What is a Cylon supposed to do for their action? Is all hes trying to do is to convince them to fail crises? Wouldnt that make it obvious who would be a Cylon then if they want to fail crises. Plus since I didnt explain the strategy too well he didnt know what to do so there wasnt that much feeling of conflict I the game. When our Cylon finally revealed he was a Cylon it was too late. We were playing to  distance since  distance seemed like it was taking forever and he revealed when we were at distance . We only had one action as a revealed Cylon and it was to use a Super Crises which was to spawn a lot of ships when we were about to jump to victory anyway. Plus he was Gaius so with his  roles cards he got both the Sympathizer and both Cylon cards. Now I didnt know much about the Cylon actions so I didnt know you can give your unrevealed Cylon to someone else so that was mainly my fault. Plus he didnt reveal his sympathizer card because I said how Cylon cards always trump the other cards so he didnt think he had to reveal it. Plus I dont think many people used their card abilities. Our turns primarily consisted of drawing cards use our action to draw another card use those cards in the crisis.Three because reasons one and two our Pilot got really bored. I didnt explain the rules clearly so that caused no sense of conflict. And we barely got any crises that spawned ships so our two pilots didnt really do much. One didnt fight a ship the whole game. Plus that and how long the game took it really took a toll on some of the players. Our pilot compared this game to dead of Winter saying how that game does everything this game does but better. And he thought I was missing something from the rules since it seemed like no ships were spawning. But that was just our luck on the draw since we were  playing correctly most of the time. Just some small things I missed.So yeah it was kinda of a bad experience. It was mainly my fault though. I bought the game read the rules and played all on the same day. I underestimate how heavy this game is. Now I have reread the rules and watched a couple of videos so I do hope to play this game cuz it seems really fun if you know the strategy and stuff. I just hope my group will give it another chance. But do you guys have any suggestions on making it a better run through?,boardgames,csmjzrs,2,t5_2qmjp

Even with the right balance the problem is that theres a fair amount of luck in both finding the agent and rolling hits. This evens out over a longer game but if you shorten it too much then it might feel too random.Anyways you should try it and tell us how it went. Maybe you could halve everything.

4415090,0,t3_3bks4m,I see you mentioned Bang!.  Why not also pick up Bang! The Dice Game?The dice game has a lot of the same mechanics as the card game  the hidden roles except for the Sheriff the rangearoundthetable mechanic the variable player powers the drinking beer to heal yourself etc.  Instead of the strategic card playing it uses a pushyourluck dice pool mechanic that still captures a lot of the feel of the original card game.  It also cuts out a lot of the cruft the dice game plays much faster than the card game and for your pain to play with person the rules are simpler and more straightforward with fewer special rules and caveats.  The game box is small needing only space for a deck of cards a few tokens and five dice.  The only down side really is that it hasnt gotten the expansion attention from the publisher that the card game has but it doesnt really need it.Our game group still likes Bang! occasionally but the dice version gets a lot more play at the table for the above reasons.,boardgames,csnbcvw,4,t5_2qmjp

That said I think many people go after games for the thematic experience and I can see how Dead of Winter would give that to them.

4437500,0,t1_csq0bu8,Elysium has a lot of replayability because of its variable setup and random card draw. And it somehow doesnt feel at least with  players that the random card draw hampers your strategies either. I find the column mechanic interesting and the art and components are phenomenal. I also dont have any games where you tap a card to use an ability so it fits a minor niche in my collection.Elysium has a pretty obvious comparison to Abyss with the deciding to lose powers in order to gain more points mechanic. Elysium is clearly the heavier of the two and I much prefer that I can choose when to trade abilities for points rather than being forced to in Abyss  keys. Elysium also has the bonus stealing mechanism of Rise of Augustus where you are constantly trying to outdo your opponents in specific things most s in Elysium most gold in Augustus to get a large supplement to your score.A bit of a larger stretch is comparing it to Firenze a Euro game that has significant potential to mess with your opponents game but they have the foresight to see it coming. There are very few blind draws in Elysium and even when there is they stay faceup in an opponents tableau.

4443570,0,t1_csqp4cy,No one would always put in only contraband for people they know always open the bag unless they were playing like idiots. They would figure out how to negotiate a bribe which gave them a bigger lead overall compared to the contraband inside you can pay the sheriff more than the penalty as a bribe and still get more points with contraband which should be enough to convince them to go for it or youd be honest sometimes and punish the people for opening your bag all the time and get money then when they start second guessing themselves and stop opening your bag thats when you sneak in the contraband. Its all doing the best you can to read other people and usually over multiple games.If youre playing the game anywhere like the way youre playing it then of course the game will suck.But thats like always saying Hit me! until you bust in Blackjack every single round.

4444329,0,t3_3by5z9,If youre deciding between Suburbia and Ludwig I would recommend Suburbia. Personally I just find it to be the deeper and more challenging game. The two are very similar but theres a small tweak to how the marketplace works in Ludwig. That tweak results in the game being mostly about the marketplace as opposed to being mostly about the building of tiles. I also find theres less player interaction in Ludwig....having said that its nice to see the floorplan of a Castle being built in front of you! Thats cool. Suburbia is abstracted by an extra layer so it looks less like a city suburb and more like a group of hexes representing a city suburb. Ludwig looks like a castle layout!I own both right now but I have Ludwig up on my trade list. ,boardgames,csqw6c5,2,t5_2qmjp

Roll is a bit simpler but can be a bit more fun. The dice add some randomness but theres plenty of ways to mitigate it. One of Rolls biggest strengths is how easy it is to teach. Most of the time after a game of Roll someone immediately suggests that we play again. In my eyes Race is the more competitive and serious of the two while Roll is more lighthearted and accessible. Both are excellent and Id say theyre absolutely worth owning theyre my  and  favorite games at the moment. ,boardgames,cssglj1,3,t5_2qmjp

Overall I was trying to focus on being accessible streamlined replayable etc. and I feel like One Night Ultimate Werewolf beats out Resistance in more categories there. One thing fans of normal Werewolf might not like about it is that it focuses much more on the logic puzzle and lying only with very little semblance of storytelling and roleplaying which are often in play in classic WW. I think this is actually something that makes ONUW more approachable though because not everyone is up and ready to act and play pretend like that.and I dont consider ONUW a version of Werewolf as that causes incorrect expectations  it is an inspiredby that unfortunately deliberately associates itself with classic Werewolf making it even more confusing,boardgames,cst92ut,2,t5_2qmjp

Lets see if I can address thoseQuestion   Professionally I am a computer engineer and have been with the Navy civilian for over  years.  Though not directly games my experience with the design process stems from my work on many software and hardware projects over the years.Question   Our graphic designer has over  years of printing experience and has published  independent comic books. I chose to go with Panda GM due to their ease of communication and quality of work.Question   Minis are great and I did consider pursuing them for the heroes but colored pawns ultimately felt like a better fit for the game.  Last Stand is a lighter game mechanically and I feel that traditional pawns help solidify the sense of the games lower barrier to entry.Question   The prototype for Last Stand was playtested for several months.  Over  individuals provided help with the playtesting many of the sessions being blind tests.  Their help absolutely improved the game balance rule clarity and overall sense of enjoyment and I am extremely grateful for their efforts.Question   The Kickstarter scene is indeed very competitive and I feel very much like the little guy in this sea of great looking projects.

4512553,0,t3_3cvtwg,If I remember correctly the event stuff like checking to see if you fall through the hole in the floor happens every time but the item stuff get an omen item etc happens only when the room is discovered. That way makes sense to me in that if you entered the room you searched it and found the items and got them. That room is now cleared of useful loot.Its not entirely in keeping with how the haunt works in the game but Id recommend fudging it a little by taking the betrayer role yourself if you can. When you are introducing a new game you are the only person you can guarantee will be interested so being on your own to understand what you have to do will not be as daunting to you as it might be for one of your players who might not have fully grasped the game yet. That said the person who gets it might be gungho to be the demon lord of whatever so then theyre probably good to go.Also the little clipon things to mark the stats tend to be really bad at staying on. Other people suggest softening the plastic by heating it up slightly and pinching them in to better grabbers.

Looking at your list your looking at this from the perspective of a gamer.  You have to keep in mind that alot of people when they hear boardgame night theyre thinking clue scrabble monopoly etc.  As you stated you dont know who and how many are going to show up.  so my advice would be to start with time tested gateway games and spend as little of the budget as i could leaving the rest to expand the collection to suit the tastes of people coming.amazon gift listHere is my thought process.  the people who are going to come are more than likely only going to be familiar with mainstream games so to start you need games that look inviting play quickly and can be taught in  minutes.  I included UNO and Jenga cause want people to have options they are familiar with. You want people to have a good time and spread the word about your event.A couple more ideasthoughts.

4562455,0,t1_ct5k2xn,Thanks Ill try to group these into what I can do and what is not possibledifficult for me to do.gt On the fronthome page where the highlighted games are shown swiping leftright seems unreliable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. Ill look into this I added a swipe gesture recognizer to the panel.  Might need to add a pan one as well.gt If possible have the search functionality have auto complete. I would need a list of every game on BGG to do this and I dont store that locally.  Dont think I can get that from their API either.gt Have images in the search results or have an option to have them. Image results are not returned from their API.  I only get id name and year.gt Have the return or Done button when searching submit the search. I can add a button to the keyboard that does the submitting.  But those buttons do nothing besides dismiss by default.gt Scrolling through game lists the fade in effect needs to be faster when scrolling faster or faster in general. If I scroll very fast to jump to a game the whole screen is fading into view and I cant see where I am. I can look into the timing on that and speed it up.gt Pull down to refresh a game listing seems very odd. Not sure what it does. I added this because the game info is grabbed and stored locally.  If you want to retrieve the most current results on the game from BGG you can pull to refresh.  It was helpful to me in testing new games that came out on the hot list and didnt have complete info until later.gt When viewing a games images keep the captions as they often tell a story about why the image is interesting or explain what you are looking at. Pulling the images is another hack since there is no API for it.  Ill look into how hard it is to retrieve the captions as well.gt Have an option to open the links to websites in SafariOther browsers. Ill look into that.  I might be able to add a button to do that on the top of the web view.  Was this mostly for the reviews?gt Have a link to BGG when viewing a game so that you can access the other features of BGG that arent implemented in the app. That would be easy to dogt Have a link to Amazon to purchase the game you can setup a referral code so you get a kickback if anyone purchases a game. Havent looked into this yet might be something to add in the future.gt I dont fully trust a random App dev with my BGG password. Ive seen in other apps you can only give your username and get the wishlist and owned lists downloaded from BGG. I know you wouldnt be able to add items or rate games Thats understandable.  I only need the username to fetch the collection but have also added in the ability to update your collection with the ownedwishlist buttons.  That requires a full login.  Maybe I could just add a readonly ability that just requires the username.gt BGG Discussions is the main feature I use on the site and it would be wonderful to have it in your app! Huge task I know Dont know much about them will have to see if there is an API for it or if I have to hack their site again.  Their API is very limited in what it can do unfortunately.,boardgames,ct5pp08,1,t5_2qmjp

Indeed the best games in these situations are ones where youre looking at each other not a bunch of game components. To that end Id say Spyfall Resistance and Skull amp Roses are all absolute winners. The gameplay in each revolves around looking at each other and talking not hunched over a board making tactical decisions. Coup and Love Letter are also good but are less interactionorientated.Getting away from bluffing games Hanabi is brilliant for making you look at people and think about what theyre thinking. Plus any game involving both memorisation and drinking is going to be hilarious With the right group Card Against Humanity is very popular and works much better when you put a specific time limit of  mins on it.

4580239,0,t1_ct7vtd4,From Urban Dictionarygt Gambling term most common in poker descibing an angry or reeling state of mind usually caused by a big or unluck loss. People playing on tilt play below their usual abillity and usually make larger and more aggressive bets to try to quickly recover their loss. In poker this is very valueble to other players at the table hence worth keeping track of andor attempting to cause. People known to be prone to tilting are often taunted or generally aggrivated when they take a loss and then egged on when they do tilt in order to keep them in this state as long as possible. The term has since spread to other games and mediums but basically it comes down to  start losing  get emotional  do something stupid making you lose more  complain about how the game is unfair,boardgames,ct7xys8,3,t5_2qmjp

4632807,0,t3_3ee6xa,Okay its not one of those games but hear me out.You want drama and backstabbing? Battlestar Galactica.If you havent watched the showand you should because it was a great show dont worry the game is amazing on its own. All you need to really know is that you are playing the last surviving members of humanity looking for a new home. A group of machines called Cylons are chasing you down attempting to wipe out the last remnants of the human race. Oh and some of those machines look act and are pretty much in every way human. Some of them dont even know they are cylons at first.That is where the best part comes in. The traitor mechanic! Anyone at the table could secretly be a cylon. You are each given a secret loyalty card at the beginning of the game that tells you if you are human or cylon. Halfway through the game the sleeper phase activates and everyone draws additional loyalty cards. This means you can start human and end up actually being a cylon.Throughout the game you deal with challenges as a group but you do so semisecretly. You all help with challenges as a team but exactly how much you are helping or hurting in the case of the cylon players is unknown. If you fail a challenge it might reveal that someone is sabotaging the group but you have no easy way of knowing who did it. It creates a lot of tension a lot of accusations of Youre a Cylon! No you are a cylon! Thats just what a cylon would say you frakking toaster!A particularly sneaky cylon player can remain hidden for the entire game just waiting for the perfect moment to reveal themselves and stab everyone else in the back. All the while they are possibly deflecting blame onto an innocent human player making everyone suspicious of each other.It is a game that will make you question your trust in your friends and it is personally my favorite boardgame.,boardgames,ctej99s,1,t5_2qmjp

The only real similarities being that they are both spaceship games and they both end up rolling lots of dice.As for why you might want to get this over Armada... this one is more of a mass combat game. Sure Armada is about capital ship battles but the game really slows down as you add minis. The  ships that come with the Halo game represent according to Spartan Games a small battle.

Core Set Yoda has become more viable over time as the pool of enhancement cards and protectors has increased.

While the time travel itself is handled really well the tragedies seem to be done terribly.  We had a person whose suicide we had to prevent and the best way for us to prevent that suicide was to kill him before he became important. I had other issues with how the game worked no table talk made it drag and coupled with even mild AP on the part of the players and mastermind it made for a miserably boring experience but I can forgive mechanics that arent my favorite  not every game is designed according to my tastes nor should I expect them to be.

After that I never played with it again.The reason is simple. When you first play it really feels like it is in the spirit of Carcassonne because it adds some flavour to the map to the landscape you are going to create. This is nice but you dont notice what is gone until you dont play with it.The river sets you and the other players apart quite some tiles and adds a lot of ways to avoid interaction with your fellow players. There are way more places to connect your pieces and this has an effect of reducing interaction from the very start.Once you play without the river you will immediately enjoy the enhanced interaction again. So for your next game of Carcassonne I recommend Do not play with the river and see if you like it more.,boardgames,ctp8vmy,7,t5_2qmjp

Because heavy is not the same as fiddly and light is not the same as elegant. Besides being incorrect your redefinition is crazy biased. Fiddly indicates a game that plays heavier than it actually is bad whereas elegant indicates a game that plays lighter than it actually is good  the terms say nothing about how heavy the game actually is.gt Or we could do away with the weight terminology all together and talk about things that matter. Is it fun? Except that fun is subjective. Is there anything more useless or frustrating in boardgaming than a debate over whether or not a game is fun?  Weight while still illdefined is an attempt to measure something objective about a game.

It adds a little more to every deck and a new AOO to fight as well as a new mechanism  Ancient Mysteries that works quite similarily to expeditions and is included via prelude or by playing with Syzgy the new AOO.Mountains of Madness is a large box. It adds a great deal to every deck implements the focus action introduces preludes and a sideboard to the game and contains two new AOO.  MoM also adds the adventure mechanism that is included via AOO or Prelude.I own both. Right now Syzgy is my favorite AOO in the game. He works off a clocklike mechanism with crazy things happening all over the place. His research cards are a blast. I think I would place it around easy to mid tier at the moment.  I strongly reccomend this expansion and I actually may reccomend it over Mountains of Madness.  You get the focus mechanism and preludes in this expansion and it has a nice price point.That being said... I really like Mountains of Madness. Ithaqua is demanding and The Rise of the Elder Things while tending to make the game longer have a really fun and different flavor.  The sideboard is terrific fun. Every space feels like you are earning something.  The adventure mechanism is a good way to advance the current mission while playing in Antarctica.  However I do feel it bloats the game a bit.  I dont regret the purchase even a little bit but more often than not Ill avoid using the sideboard if I want a quick game andor am teaching some players.All this being said if you do not own Forsaken Lore buy it now. It fixes the mystery decks for the first batch of AOO and that in and of itself is worth more than whats in the other boxes.TLDRForsaken Lore is a must buy.Strange Remnants would be my suggested second buy.Mountains of Madness is a good expansion and you wont regret it.,boardgames,ctu87yd,2,t5_2qmjp

I think both of them are great games and I am very happy to have both in my collection but they are very different games. Often in Agricola you struggle at points in the game just to feed your family and because every category has a hard limit on the number of points it can earn you madly scramble to try and diversify. In Caverna on the other hand feeding your family is rarely a concern though you do try to optimize it of course. And because categories are not capped for points you can just really focus on one thing for victory points. Caverna is much more relaxed than Agricola as a result for better and for worse. ,boardgames,ctvo6i7,2,t5_2qmjp

4816023,0,t3_3gul1j,The game is very light. I would say that because everybody compares it to Carcassonne is much heavier than Cacao in terms of decisions to make each turn. I hope you did note the much in the previous sentence! In the end it all revolves around an optimization problem given your current hand of tiles and what is available also factoring in the move that gives as little away as possible to your opponent. I have only played this game player. However I dont see how more players would make a difference to the game except for the worship tokens to be more important and maybe the shrines will become a tad bit more important as players effectively loose points if they dont at least put one worker next to a shrine. In my opinion the game is okayish... I do agree with the review but  I think that the game never intended to be anything more than an easy filler that scratches a very mild optimization itch . Further I would also guess that the game will get boring after a some plays as your options per turn are really limited to the  or  actions available on the djungle tiles.

4840650,0,t1_cu4ozjz,Thats fair. But if youre going to base a portion of your review on how this new game deviates further from the Magic formula than the old game then thats misleading. If anything several of the new additions to the game bring the game closer to magic than before. This includes the introduction of pseudomana symbols an individual turn format less strict formation rules and the change to the activation of plot twists from the resource. The one area where the new VS deviates from the magic formula is the change to the win condition by introducing main characters. All of these changes to the new game aside from the introduction of main characters have brought VS System closer to being a magic clone than before and in doing so should make the game appeal to a casual audience and welcome the introduction of new players better than the old VS. I dont think any of the changes are bad but the game is definitely different from the original vs and more akin to magic than before which is important to note for anyone interested in giving the game a try. I personally played a lot of the original VS and I own and have played a fair bit of the new VS. I love both versions so far but they each have their own unique feel.

4852133,0,t3_3hb871,Had a couple of decent game nights this week!Last Monday had to run a solo Dungeons and Dragons session for one of my players who broke away from the party. Went smoothly and afterwards we decided to play a bunch of games Takenoko Bohnanza Love Letter Batman x Betrayal at House on the Hill House of the living dead haunt only hero luckily found a revolving wall and avoided connecting it to the house so they had some free time to find a bunch of items and raise stats before taking on the zombies! Sheriff of Nottingham Mystery Mansion and Epic Spell Wars. Tuesday night was our regularly scheduled game night so we played a few titles. One player managed to win every single game we played. Which were Mystery Mansion Guillotine Careers and then x rounds of Lost Cities.Didnt have much playing after that as our local Fringe festival is going and we love theatre but I also fit in a round of Smash Up Princess Werewolves VS Giant Ant Ninjas and x more rounds of Takenoko.Got some more games in the mail too. So Ive got some more choices for next game night which probably wont be until after the Fringe.,boardgames,cu65bij,1,t5_2qmjp
4852824,0,t1_cu66uku,The base game always has the same cards available for purchase. That means games can get very samey as youre always going to either obtain or block the same synergies.With the Harbor you shuffle all the cards together and then deal until you have  unique cards on the table. If you deal something youve already got out there it just goes on top of it. So both the types of cards and the number of cards available for purchase change every game. As you buy things if you deplete a stack you deal again until you have  unique cards. You may only see  Cheese Factory the entire game. Or maybe youll see  but only  card that combos with it etc. It means you have to tactically adapt to whats out there or play some riskreward on the more powerful cards.,boardgames,cu68gee,1,t5_2qmjp

4867418,0,t1_cu82hq5,Hey thanks for the comment. It is a modern retheme of Alchemists  with a few exceptions really. All reverse deduction games will work in a similar way and so finding out the hypersymmetry property for the particles works in a very similar way... However games differs on a few levels quite vastly. First Alchemists is definitely not approachable by younger kids  it is a great game but a solid bit heavy on the rules and the deduction system in multilayered and complicated with so many secret properties to track. Publish or Perish aim to be as easy and approachable as possible  we already had testing sessions with kids from  to  to prove that our deduction system is easy to handle for them intuitive and entertainingA little video from the test  You can see the fun!Another difference is that while Alchemists is a competitive game Publish or Perish is a cooperative game that in the end is more similar to Pandemic where all players strive together against odds to reach for the Noble Prize and discover the rules of hypersymmetry before they run out of time and funds. Therefore the goal of the game is different to its core.Thinking about Publish or Perish as Alchemists tailored for kids and families with the addition of being firmly based on actual science consulted by the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Poland is quite a correct approach.,boardgames,cu82por,3,t5_2qmjp

4889005,0,t3_3hthdp,Yeah my favorite game and the one I know all the rules the best.So... errata is actually where this question is answered. And the answer is actually no. Any effects that add attack dice only affect the first attack in a multistrike attack whether its a double or triplestrike or a Battle Fury card. The game was quickly found to be broken when people figured out how to throw  dice is a single attack by buffing and using Battle Fury.  dice in a turn can kill any single Mage with really good rolls and it was broken. To counteract that they released an errata stating that those buffs only help the first attack and any subsequent attacks are just the natural dice for the attack.Example Forcemaster uses his full action to doublestrike the opposing mage. He has Gauntlets of Strength and Bear Strength equipped along with his Galvitar Force Blade. The first attack is with  dice and the second will be  dice totaling an  dice attack.SourceLook under Modifying Attack DicePiercing  will affect all dice rolls. Tooth amp Nail would buff a pet on a counterstrike and quick attack.Again multiple strikes only the first would get the additional dice for the attack.I recommend taking a look through the whole PDF I linked to you it will help you understand some of the more difficult card interactions in the game. I play Mage Wars with my GF and it is a beast to get through. We both rules lawyer a bit to make sure we are playing it right and if something seems off we look it up. Makes our games last a bit too long sometimes but I think we both know the rules pretty fucking well now.,boardgames,cuasqfi,3,t5_2qmjp

Their friends and family would get a small cash payout should one of them commit suicide after taping as a result.The Huge library of games would only be Hasbro games as they were the highest bidder.   The rest of the library would either be duplicates or just a wall of cardboard spines like the books on the back of the Judge Judy set that that are just full of camera equipment.The winners would be determined beforehand.  Games would either be played multiple times until that person lost or edited to make it look like that person lost.Games would be dumbed down for a regular audience.  Times Up would be dumbed down to be more like Cards Against Humanity.  Dixit would be dumbed down to be more like Cards against Humanity.

4959951,1,t1_cujq3jf,No such thing as season .You mean Complete First Edition? You dont really need first edition nor is it coming back. Second edition is better and available. It doesnt come in a big box because people complained too much about the price so Sirlin released them all individually and in packs. So you can buy decks individually and if you want a big box you can buy the EX powerup box which comes with a big box for all  characters and other stuff full contents list on the page I linked to. Whats the difference between first and second edition? First edition contained the first  characters.  Then the expansion came out with another  characters and with them came new improved decks of the original  characters. Thats what second edition is. According to Sirlin there are no plans for a new version of Yomi for some time. Maybe sometime in the far future there can be a new version of Yomi but Sirlin has many other things hes focusing on like rFantasyStrike fighting game and rCodexGame his customisable but not collectible card game and rFlowchartGame which he hasnt talked much about yet. ,boardgames,cujqozq,1,t5_2qmjp

4961215,0,t3_3iuygg,rtabletopgamedesign exists!Anyway... if Im honest theres a couple good things about this idea but as a whole it does not sound well designed. Overall Im tempted to say that if someone starts to make a game some aspect of it had to be worth having a game made theyve just gone about it wrong if it ends up poor. Thats what Im kinda getting from this. The idea of using your phone in weird ways is a potentially appealing one that IMO none of your tasks really get right.Biggest recommendation play some newer or wellregarded party games like Wits and Wagers Say Anything Snake Oil Spyfall Loony Quest and Times Up or Monikers or Celebrities etc. Times Up goes by a lot of names.... These dont use phones but will show you what people nowadays are looking for in a good party game.Because based on what Im seeing in the small hints at the design here youve played maybe Trivial Pursuit and Cranium and the like. These are not awful games but better party games have been made in the opinions of most people that are into board games now.The biggest problems I see with your design. Nose in phones. Party games are inherently social and at their best are hilarious and unexpected. Theres nothing hilarious or unexpected about forcing people to sift through their phones searching for a specific YouTube video the designer likes or having a person play a round of Angry Birds. I think your best bet for integrating mobile devices into games is a dedicated app See Alchemists and XCOM for games where apps are very integral but theyre not partystyle. See One Night Ultimate Werewolf for a party game with a very useful but optional app.. Vanilla challenges Pretty much all of these challenges are a snoozefest for anyone that isnt doing the challenge and at worst are for the person doing it too. Finding that roomba video is very specific a yellow flower picture is unexciting the dog thing is an interesting tidbit thats better suited for a pure trivia game the tune is somewhat interesting but would take a while to have start and relies on knowledge of s songs that start with love that your friend doesnt know like really? what if someone doesnt like Angry Birds or sucks at it  they didnt sign up for the Angry Birds Skill Challenge they signed up for a board game having friends text back takes an unreliable amount of time especially if you have to steer the conversation towards certain words finding a friend in fairly normal clothes on facebook is uninteresting the Swedish cupcake thing could take forever and isnt particularly fascinating the weather thing could literally be impossible and who cares if you can find a  BMW. I would fall asleep if a game forced other people to do these things and I had to sit and watch.. Outdated design. Now I am not certain of the design but it sounds very similar to Trivial Pursuit from your brief description. Dont. Nobody actually wants to roll a die and be forced to go that many spaces and have the game continue on endlessly because they cant freaking land on a Pink space to get the win. Rollandmove games exist and succeed because thats what people think board games are not because people have tons of fun rolling and moving. Dont be what people expect be what people want.In party games people want very social games. That means everyones talking laughing teasing playarguing etc. But you can still do that during my game! is not a good defense for this. Your game has to heavily encouragemake people do it otherwise they could just make small talk. IMO your best bet is to develop an app for the game that in some way delivers tons of unique challenges that get people talking in that way. You could even use stuff like texting but only to text people that are there playing the game to relay secret messages across the table perhaps. Some quick ideas The group picks a movie theyve all seen and pick out a number of major scenes they find crucial to the movie  players scenes. Then assign groups of two those scenes and they go with their phones into different areas and reenact the scene they were given. If everyone is signed in to the game round on the app then the app can stitch together the movie out of all the scenes for everyone to watch.Or the app gives everyone a personal noun like Cowboy. One person takes a selfie with the app and everyone signed into the game gets sent that picture. Now everyone doodles on that person to make them into a cowboy. Once everyone has finished the app shows them all the drawings they didnt do and everyone votes on who they think drew the best Cowboy version of the friend.,boardgames,cujwf1p,3,t5_2qmjp

4962793,0,t1_cuk2gyt,gtPretty sure that anyone interested in Battlecon is going to be interested in Yomi too theyre direct competitors in a very small niche. For that reason Im also not considering games like Mage Wars which are quite different genres.Er both games are duel games and likewise every link I posted in a  player duel game. Whether or not a game plays like another game usually isnt the factor in a cost of the game.gtI did state the differences that might account for more cost  its mostly more cards.Eh then wed see a pack of playing cards going for a lot more than a booster pack of Magic. The amount of cards is a factor but theres also more artwork which means more money paid for the artists game design and balancing.gtIf the bigger size of a Yomi deck corresponded to a similar increase in depth complexity or longevity I could accept the  price tag for a full set but it doesnt. Anyone whos played both games will agree that they offer similar amounts of tactical consideration depth etc  certainly theres not a wide gulf. Battlecon simply has a more elegant design that allows them to be more efficient with their cards. As such you can get  characters for around  retail which is obviously better value than  for .Depth complexity and longevity are factors that only some people might care about and others might even be turned off by. Does a game being deeper make it a better game? If a game is insanely complex does that mean everyone will like it? Can you even quantify longevity? This is a really weak argument here and you only back it up with your opinion.gtBattlecon simply has a more elegant design that allows them to be more efficient with their cards. As such you can get  characters for around  retail which is obviously better value than  for .I disagree. I feel Yomi has the more elegant design with deeper characters satisfying attack combinations faster gameplay and using just cards instead of having a fiddle board and cardboard cutouts. Having a smaller cast of characters that are fleshed out more is something I and other people may prefer over a large amount of characters that use the same cards.And they do play differently. As said before Yomi has a system that plays extremely quickly and efficiently with games taking as little as  minutes. You can easily play multiple games of the game and have a good time. Yomis hand system allows new players to ease into the game because cards will only ever be attacks blocksdodges or throws. BattleCON throws your  bases at you plus  modifiers which then you have to compare to your opponents  bases and modifiers along with your current position on the game board. It is not only more time consuming but it is also more fiddly than elegantly playing a card and resolving it in a quick manner as you would in Yomi.The brevity of play and intuitive gameplay make Yomi a lot more appealing for me than BattleCON. Each character feels more distinct and personal than simply adding some new ability and a few modifier cards and calling it a new character. You really notice the characters because they feel different. A character like Setsuki is a ninja and as such she has a lot of dodges. Rook is a rock golem and he actually has no dodges at all and must rely on brute forcing his way. Theres a sense of progression and excitement that comes when you build up your hand and play powerful combinations in Yomi. For instance each character has an Ace which is their most powerful attack in the game. For Rook if you have  Aces you get the decent Wall of Vines that does  damageBut when you have all  Aces you can do the move that does the most damage in the game the dreaded Checkmate Buster. This move does  damage which can often end games cold the underside of the same card. So theres a sense of depth that comes from hand management and seeing if you should use an Ace now or try and go hail mary and try to nab  for that ultimate.And you dont get that in BattleCON. There really is no sense of progression. I mean there are characters that get stronger I guess with more tokens and such but its really basic and unexciting. And thats because you have access to every option on turn  as you do on turn  barring the  cards previously used. It just feels boring and stagnant that each round I have access to every attack Ive started with. With Yomi theres that sense of progression where cards are used for multiple options and the accomplishment of pulling off a particularly flashy and damaging combination. Its that excitement you get in RPGs where you do basic crap at level  but at level  you are summoning dragons launching hurricanes transforming into demons etc. In actual Street Fighter doing a special move takes dedication and practice so that doing it feels special rather than pushing a button and getting a kick. A special move has flashy animations cool effects and is enjoyable to watch. Doing a special move every other turn in BattleCON just doesnt feel special.Everytime a game analysis comes up its always the BattleCON players who are the first to bring up the price analysis. The reality is that people need to play both games and see what they prefer and buy that game if they so wish to do. Price is independent to the quality of gameplay. I could spend  on the latest Call of Duty or I can spend  on CounterStrike Source. If I really prefer Call of Dutys gameplay then it probably makes more sense for me to buy that and spend more rather than buying a cheaper alternative and have me grumble that I would rather play Call of Duty.People need to play both and see what gameplay they prefer. With these games being the type that they are price doesnt even really matter in the long run. If you sink hundreds of hours into a game the real value is the time you spent with the game system more so than a game being  or so less.,boardgames,cuk3kkw,2,t5_2qmjp

4970012,0,t3_3iyu72,I own both and like both quite a bit but I think theyre pretty different games. TTR Europe is my favorite version of TTR great to introduce to new gamers because tons of people like trains and beautiful maps and the rules are simple. Its my goto gateway game.IS is not something Id introduce to a brand new gamer. There are too many ideas to understand like comboing cards how to get the most out of your deck how to build towards a big last round and it also has more direct player interaction razing cards vs blocking routes in TTR. IS is much more thinky than TTR and something I love to introduce to experienced gamers but not something Id pull out with new gamers.Both are great games but to me it would come down to which situation you find yourself in more introducing new gamers to hobby board games or playing with beginning gamers that want to go deeper and dive into a fun interesting card game.,boardgames,cul09ir,2,t5_2qmjp

4975405,0,t3_3j21nh,Imperial Settlers is by no means a brilliant game. Its a great game. Just not super duper amazing.But it has a lot of things going for it.  Its easy to learn to gamers and nongamers.  It plays fast. Most of the time under an hour. Which is ideal for us. Long enough to give a full board game experience and yet short enough to play on a week night. Some might find the art style too Facebookgamelike. But that style adopted by those game developers isnt an accident. That style is universally appealing. That art style is what allows you to sell this game to almost anyone. It looks cute fun and appealing and as a result the barrier of entry is much lower than with other civilization building card games like Race For The Galaxy. When buying board games always remeber that what you want to play doesnt matter. Its what your group wants to play thats key in a succesful board game purchase.   It scales well.  players are pretty great. I think solo is good also. Especially with the free official campaign rules released a couple of months ago. There is more player interaction that in most typical tableauengine building games. Not that you constantly are stealing from each other but certainly enough to constantly keep a close eye on what the other players are doing and intervene when necessary.  Its a game thats well supported. The first expansion was small and fun. The next expansion adds another harder faction and allows you to play with  players. Portal Games published official solo campaing rules that are a free download. And more expansions are to come. It has even more potential. Right now the game offers a small deck building mechanic where you can swap out some of the basic cards with the cards from the expansion. But if more expansions are to be released deckbuilding could become an important aspect to device new strategies. Of course you can avoid deckbuilding and just put in all the cards from every expansion. So not a brilliant game. But a game that sees our table a lot and always delivers a fun experience and a great time. Its still a thinky game though. Sqeezing the most out of your cards can be challening at times and responding to what your opponent is doing is even harder. But the rules are simple and the game play smooths.I generally recommend this game to pretty much everyone. Its not too expansive scales well is easy to play and is universally appealing.

The nd edn. bishop is not so much overpowered as simply not fun very similar to the surrender card but less fun and as you say would drag the game while the nd edn. scarecrow is clearly overpowered take ANY card from ANY player back into your hand. Those rules would ruin the game for me.After playing Condottiere FF rd many times messing up rules along the way theres one rule that must be followed or the game looses all the tension from bluffing the end of round condition. Players simply drop out if they have no more cards or discard them but the rest keep playing until only one player has cards left. Only then does the round reset.

5009520,0,t3_3jizs6,Imperial. Stock trading via war. I absolutely love this game. The players play as Swiss investors making money by making the six major powers before World War One dance to their tune. Uses a rondel for actions and there is literally no luck anywhere in this game unless you consider player action a form of luck. Istanbul. Run around the city of Istanbul and use your assistants to pick up goods go gambling and the like. The first two accumulate a specific amount of rubies wins. There is luck in some of the locations you can go but even the spaces that rely on a dice roll always have a base pay out for going there. Hey! Thats My Fish. Randomized board set up and then everything is all player choice trying to claim as many fish as possible while the terrain breaks apart. Super cutthroat with a cutesy theme. Its one of my most played games. Wallenstein. It uses a cube tower to resolve battles that randomized battles but most of the time battles are fairly predictable. Starting distribution of territory is also a draft so theres random there but once the game gets going most of this game is clever maneuvering.

5049185,0,t3_3k3nsz,So heres the thing.Pathfinder DampD WoD these guys are the equivalent of Monopoly and Risk. Traditional but not innovative at all.Theres some really cool stuff happening in the hobby its just pretty deep in the indie sphere. You want to check out Ben Robbins Microscope a game about exploring timelines nonlinearly.Check out Vincent Bakers Apocalypse World. The move triggers changed the way RPGs are approached so did the GM rules.And you dont have to be a lightweight game to be innovative. Burning Wheel proves that. It focuses entirely on character beliefs and the conflicts they cause. On how they change over time. Ideally over years of play. Blades in the Dark by John Harper is also deceptively deep and meant to be played for a while.Every game by Emily Care Boss is brilliant. Her entry for a short game competition made me tear up. Seriously. Its called Budget or something. Its brilliant. Shes made a name for herself by designing games about romantic relationships and they are all brilliant.Avery McDaldnos design and writing is beyond brilliant. Monsterhearts is a great game whether you are into the source material or not. Dream Askew is one of the finest games out there. A masterpiece for sure.Dog Eat Dog teaches with its mechanics what is bad with colonialism. Dogs in the Vineyard does the same for blindly following religion. I could go on.Just like for board games if you want to find the good stuff you have to dig a little further than the five or six big games that were important in the s and s. Dig in.

It is a game set during the reign of Porfirio Daz president of Mexico from .  You play Hacendados  powerful and wealthy business owners in Mexico during this time.  You decide which direction you want to see your country go while amassing wealth and power  do you support Daz and the status quo support a new candidate to overturn his reign support US intervention or side with communist rebels to topple the current system?Like most Eklund games there is an auction mechanic to the game.  If you successfully topple the government and have enough faction points you win otherwise the most gold at the end of Dazs reign is the winner.  Its a wonderful example of how economic motives influence political outcomes covers a segment of time that is underrepresented in games and overall will give you many meaningful decisions to make throughout the game.  Yes the busy cards will be a distraction when you first learn the game but like the icons in Race for the Galaxy you will quickly adapt and the layout will start making sense.If you like historical games or games with auction mechanics worker placement card drafting direct player conflict andor alternate victory paths then its worth it.

Dead of Winter has both separate win conditions and a possible traitor.In Discworld Ankh Morpork everyone is a character from the series. Which character you are determines your win condition so theres a lot more deduction there and figuring out how to effectively block someone from winning.Spyfall is a rather recent party game where one person is the spy and trying to figure out where everyone else is without giving away your spyness.

There was always some negligence glaring misrepresentation or other underlying issue that really frustrated alienated and most importantly defrauded me of my money.Im sure Asylum was similar.

I love all those games but I need a good head to head game at time.  My wife is very fond of dungeon crawl games so the Marauding monsters are right up her alley.,boardgames,cv1ds7h,1,t5_2qmjp
5105866,0,t3_3kwdc2,Better than I thought thanks to solo plays and a game day on my wifes birthday.Caverna The Cave Farmers x   games with my wife  games solo... and like Agricola I suck at this game overall.  I need more solo plays to figure out the strategies and I am starting to improve.Pandemic x  One game with lab challenge virulent strain the bad events from State of Emergency  epidemics  and we lost by  purple cube.  If we had one more we would of won on the last turn of cards.... arrrrgh!  Then for the heck of it we played a base game only to remind ourselves what it was like  epidemics base components only  and we rocked it.  It also reminded me why people might grow to dislike this game.  When they did e they should have merged some game elements from On The Brink into the product such as more event cards for variable setup.Betrayal at House on the Hill x   players with  people each.  Wife was the traitor I needed to give an object to a statue.  The one she was most vulnerable to was the best one to give then she picked up the second one... in the end only basement tiles with her traitor were left and there was no way I could win.  Good narrative horrible as a game.Brass x  This was her board game night pick at the FLGS.  Finally got to play it with  players rather than the  player variant and wish we could have found a th.Eldritch Horror x  solo with Barnaby and OToole vs Shub Niggurath.  In a frustrating turn of events I solved my rd mystery and that same turn the mythos card pushed the doom to exactly .  I had to race to get to Shub Niggurath and spent my built up focus and clue tokens to shotgun him a Goatspawn a Night Gaunt and a Cthonian into oblivion.  Told a wonderful story.  However the only reason I won was due to a house rule test for  players if at the start of a turn an investigator has no travel tickets he gets one of his choice for free an investigator may have up to  travel tickets.  This allows  investigators to cover the board as well as .  I wound up using these extra travel tickets in  of my movements but otherwise never got a free travel token beyond the start of the game.gtHave you ever played games too many times in a week and felt board game fatigue?Not really.  I have had depressive moods that make me feel like doing nothing in a week but never really had a burnout of just boardgames.gtWhat is your primary reason for playing board games as opposed to TV video games or myriad other options?I stare at computer screens all day I like the social framework it provides when interacting with others I enjoy the tactile sense of the game I like exploring the intellectual space a games theme provides and finally I really like the active engagement that board gaming provides rather than passive or semipassive entertainment... more and more video games are cut scenes with quick time events.,boardgames,cv1g4bz,1,t5_2qmjp

5107231,0,t1_cv1ftef,Taste is subjective but I would go so far as to say it is indisputably a great game design.So the game works and it works very well. Its not for everybody but the people who do like it tend to love it.Ill start with the cons Its a little long. Games will take  hours more as youre learning. There are plenty of longer games but most people prefer games that last less than two hours not at least two hours. It is exclusively for two players. Though theres now a solo variant I didnt know about. For lots of people that means it doesnt get to the table as often. The Cold War doesnt have the broad appeal of some of some other themes. I love it though. The better player has a significant advantage. Thats great for a competitive game but its limiting. If you dont have an opponent at about your skill level one player wont be challenged and the other will have little hope for victory.As for the pros It has an amazing level of tension. Youre almost always in crisis management mode trying to push your agenda while avoiding thermonuclear war. You have to try to put out fires while your opponent keeps lighting them and try to light some of your own. It rewards multiple plays. Theres at least one strategy guide out there so thorough it goes into detail on every card in the game. The more you play the more you know what to expect and how to leverage an advantage when you get one. It just works. All of the mechanisms are simple and connect to one another in a straightforward and clean way. You get a ton of interesting decisions to make. You can play your cards for operations points or the event on the card. Some cards get removed from the game when used as an event others will repeat. You might have to play your opponents events but you have limited abilities to avoid doing it or to do it at just the right moment so they cant take advantage of it. It has the clearest rulebook Ive ever read.Basically Id recommend everyone take a look at the game and everyone interested in it ought to try it if they get the chance. Not everyone will have fun playing it and thats okay but its worth trying because it might become a favorite.,boardgames,cv1m1yw,17,t5_2qmjp

Ive actually played with a few people who had trouble grasping the rules of it at first but everyone ends up loving it in the end.

Tabletop is one of the things that got me into the hobby but boy if I didnt outgrow it fast. I couldnt care less about the cadre of DList celebrities and the show often fails to give me an idea of how much Id actually enjoy the game or what its like to actually play it. I dont want to sound snobbish but TableTop to me at least is more for people who are interested in these geek culture personalities doing... things on camera in this case it just happens to be playing board games than people interested in seeing demo plays of games because they actually like board games. They cut stuff out they get rules wrong they play poorly or dont understand the game. Then theres the infallible defense of Thats not what the show is about! And they get a free pass on any and every mistake. Then what the hell is the show about? YouTube personalities having fun? Pass.

Im not bringing Caverna down I really do enjoy it but if you didnt really appreciate Agricola I dont think getting Caverna is the best idea.However I will recommend Glass Road by Uwe Rosenberg. Its a p game and I like just as much at any player count. It plays a bit differently at p than at  and p so if you do play it beware of that.

5208251,0,t3_3mbxrg,Hey there!  I run the Gamers Society at my college.  We do open gaming nights every other Thursday and we also have a library of board games that are available for checkout to students on campus.  We have over  members on the roster but our events draw around  people.  Here are a few tricks Ive picked up Try to use games with a wide variety of themes in order to appeal to many different people.  Thematic games are great for drawing people in.  Some favorites in my group are Cosmic Encounter Pandemic Space Alert Betrayal at House on the Hill Power Grid Stone Age The Resistance Coup Love Letter Elder Sign Carcassonne and many others. Dont neglect the Freshmen.  They will make up a large part of your base and they will also be the ones leading the society when you are gone. Try to draw in some girls.  Seriously.  No one wants to go to a game night if its going to be a boys club.  Having at least a small base of girls that come and play goes a long way toward convincing other girls that its cool to come because they wont have to deal with the awkwardness of being one of the only girls there.  My club has  girls holding officer positions and another  that go to the game nights.  Its awesome.,boardgames,cvdsbkc,2,t5_2qmjp

Some other quick ones for youDead of Winter is a Zombie themed SemiCooperative meaning everyone is trying to accomplish their own goals to win competitively but if they pursue those objectives too hard it can spell doom for the entire colony. This game also has a betrayer mechanic that can make the game interesting.Cosmic Encounter plays up to  shouldnt be played under  but features bluffing card play easily shifting alliances and munchkin style pile on the leader play. This game has a lot of expansions that can increase the player count. You may get to  for  if you shop well.Battlestar Galactica is Humans vs. Cylons with the humans trying to deduce the identity of the Cylons and return to earth while the Cylons try to thwart them from within.

5254979,0,t3_3mxu21,Quarterbacking to me has two sides of the story.In cooperative games an element of quarterbacking is often encouraged imo because it is to everyones advantage in the game to discuss the best possible move and work together.  The most important thing here is to make sure you are actively requesting input from the other players so that youre not dominating the conversation.However not every group plays like this and you have to be open to discussion.  Our groups usually play coop games with  or more quarterbacks and it works for us but I also expect to be shot down if Im getting annoying.  Maybe you should chat with this group and tell them to say something during the game if its a problem because its worth discussing.I can be a quarterback and I play with other quarterbacks.  The level we quarterback at works fine for our group but I would hope others would call me out gently if they are annoyed by it and then progressively less gently if I dont get the hint.That being said we did recently play a game of Ghost Stories at the Hell hardest difficulty with two experienced quarterbacks my first time playing but with quarterback tendencies and one other less forceful firsttime player.  We kicked ass and won with all four players alive at the end and all had great fun.  I certainly wont argue with the results.,boardgames,cvjevr4,5,t5_2qmjp

The four new characters have some interesting Goodwill  Mastermind abilities too  for example one of them cant have cards played on them but are instead effected by every card played in the room.If youve played the original game enough to be starting to get a little bored of the Basic Tragedy then its definitely worth getting just to have the variety.

Rolling dice is simply more fun than using a random number generator. Taking physical bits that represent money feels like youve actually done something. Screwing up horribly at a dexterity game is just as entertaining as making that  in a million shot.

I will throw away inserts if I have to but if I cant stuff the extra content in the base box I probably wont buy it unless the original box is extremely efficient  i.e. Tiny Epic Kingdoms Ill probably get Heroes Call even though its a separate box just because TEK respects my shelf space.

5336703,0,t3_3o3kzt,I finished playing the first scenario last night with two players only. As everyone has already mentioned before the first game plays very similarly to a regular game of Pandemic. Its actually been a while since Ive played normal Pandemic so I cant comment on if it is as easy as playing normal Pandemic with two players. I will say that we did win the first month although it was definitely helpful to have the combination of character powers funded events and luck of the draw that we had. Going into the game knowing that there are permanent consequences definitely made the game feel more tense for both of us.There was definitely a moment of hesitation for my girlfriend to ruin a card or alter the game board. I think people who havent played a legacy game before will have this slight hesitation in the back of their mind before the place a sticker or scratch off a card.Ive been thinking about the game all day at work today and cannot wait to dive into month two later tonight and see what new surprises await. I think the game still works well with two players and the amount of discussion that we both had during the first game will only be amplified with more players.

5367025,0,t1_cvxhepn,Thats the thing. dead of winter isnt a story game. Its a coop game a traitor element tacked on that doesnt feel complete because the semicoop objectives are designed to give cover to the traitor instead of it just being a good coop with a traitor mechanic. Itd also not a story game.because the story elements feel tacked on because of their incohesiveness and the fact that they dont show up that often in the game. Even the zombie theme feels hastily pasted on. Of course thats the point of the game the players are the real enemy but then why make it a zombie game in the first place? Oh thats right. It sells better. At any rate. Its not a story game. Eldritch is a coop game with a strong story elements because theyre cohesive. Dow is coop game with a weak theme weak traitor mechanic and weak story mechanic. It tries to do many things and does them poorly instead of dark moon or eldritch that do few things but do them exceedingly well. Thats my problem with the game. Its just ok. And for all the hype I expected a game that was better than just ok. Sadly most people dont seem to care and will suffer through the unbalanced objectives and bad games for the great games they can have and then color their perception of the game through those good experiences instead of the bad ones.

Those are the typical euro critiques I find valid against this game.Legendarythe random hero row can leave you with no heroes available to purchase that fit the strategy of your deck screwing over some players with luck of the draw while others get what they need. Additionally being rewarded for defeating villains makes a rich get richer issue though that is solved in the expansion. Additionally my first complaint could just as easily be seen as a feature rather than a bug as you can build your deck in ways to remain open to what comes out later and being able to shift gears midgame to adjust to what comes out could be seen as an important aspect of the game to figure out.SuburbiaI will start with saying I absolutely disagree with everyone who says this game looks bad. I absolutely love this games aesthetic. The only bad part is the box cover art. Continuing on I will repeat some of the other complaints I had about Puerto Ricoit is not exciting and doesnt create memorable moments. Additionally while every game may play out differently in terms of what tiles you use to execute this strategy every game is relatively similar in that its always about creating an economic engine tanking that engine as you increase your population restoring your economy boosting population again rinse and repeat until game end.

5396224,1,t1_cw0qbzn,it really isnt though. dont let the look or people who havent playd it enough to realize it is a bad game to deceive you.the penalty for calling out other players is far too severe and therefore most people play annoyingly cautiously the first half of the game or so just doesnt matter and the eventual winner is usually decided arbitrarily by another player. when a viable strategy is purposefully play poorly early so no one targets me then thats the sign of a bad game. i was actually dragged into a game last weekend and the woman who was playing the best game had people coup and assassinate her on consecutive turns and just like that was out of it. and at the end of the game i found myself in the familiar situation where i had to coup one of two people and whoever i didnt coup was guaranteed to win due to no skill of their own. and its just not a fun process either. i had fun playing coup once  when my friend first got it. three of us played rapidfire with entire games lasting maybe  minutes. there was a lot of bluffing and calling and it was just quick and fun. then we added more people and people started figuring out that the way to win was to slow the game down and play cautiously. when playing for fun and playing to win require two different playstyles thats another sign of a bad game.,boardgames,cw1fenc,0,t5_2qmjp

Its bringing a LOT of people to Kickstarter and some backers might still peruse the site for other games to support. In the end big name Kickstarter projects are here to stay lol.We really didnt factor in window shoppers when we chose our launch date. It was really important to create our own organic fan base before going live. We spent  months demoing the game at Gen Con and local tabletop meetups before launching to make sure the campaign would have a good push right out of the gate.Now  weeks into the campaign our project is pretty much buried on the site and probably wont get featured. As creators its up to us to get out there and show the game to new people. That being said well be at Valorcon in Chicago this weekend working our behinds off!,boardgames,cw1gudq,2,t5_2qmjp

5401824,0,t3_3oxihq,Reading the Rhino Hero review now a couple more comments  I see youre setting up a template with the Whats not in the box section something I thought was unnecessary in the FT review. Im going to wager that almost all of your reviews are going to say Whats not in the box? Everything you need is in the box. Id suggest adding that section in as needed rather than having it there all the time when it will almost never be useful. And finally regarding this But it is produced by Haba Games so you know they will be great. Dont assume your readers know everything you do. If we did we wouldnt be reading your reviews.  I personally have no idea what to expect from Haba Games so that doesnt help me. Something like Haba Games is known for high quality components and this game is no exception or Ive come to expect great components from Haba games and they maintain that high level of quality here would be more helpful. And one more bonus comment  well done with the games you selected to review. I hadnt heard of Rhino Hero before and it sounds like one I may want to track down. I appreciate review sites that point me to new games especially family type games that might not appeal to others at the sites I frequent. Keep it up man! ,boardgames,cw255dx,2,t5_2qmjp

A lot of them now will expand to twice what they look like theres a little button on the long side and if the ones at your hospital do a nurse could show you how to do that if you cant find it. Basically another little tray slides out from underneath the top of it and it almost doubles the size of the surface.My best recommendation for a game is Jaipur.

5443821,0,t1_cw6vohv,Totally agree with Argent. Its often dubbed the Twilight Imperium of worker placement both for deceptively long playtime only five rounds riiiight? And for the ability to eat tables. Its heavy but in a digestible way  I can get a lot more players interested in playing Argent than Kanban and theyre the same weight. Theme comes straight through  as youre all professors gunning for next chancellor of BattleCON Hogwarts did I mention this is Level World of Indines? and sending students out to run errands. Importantly you know three of the people wholl vote for chancellor at game end. There are twelve. And they all vote. So you want to find out what they want while also schmoozing enough of the voters you know about and opponents hopefully dont to be voted the new Chancellor. Each pawn belongs to its own magic school and does different things based on it  so instead of  I have five discs to place its I have three red mages a green and a purple and all three colors behave differently when taking a space.The icing on the cake its a hybrid game. Whereas Eclipse hybridizes American dice combat into a Terra Mystica space economy Argent hybridizes heavy player interaction and Take That into worker placement of all places. Placement isnt checked until round end and then things resolve. Oh you took the best spot with a Fast action Mage? Too bad I lit him on fire and took his spot shortly before round end. Unfortunately the very last action before last Bell Tower was to shuffle positions around in that room so now a third player is taking top action Im taking bottom which I didnt want and youre still in the infirmary. Rounds go until no one can do anything with regular actions at which point Bell Tower cards get taken as actions and when theyre gone the round is up. This makes a lot of rounds tense cold wars of nope Im not making my move just gonna cast some spells over here and then everyone trying to out maneuver everyone else once theyve made opponents use more actions than them. Which is also a lot like TI but harder to articulate to someone who hasnt played one or the other.Im ranting here but Argent is one of my two favorite thematic WP games the others Dungeon Lords and since its from a company who mostly gets recognized here and on bgg and not in most stores less people know about it.,boardgames,cw7i14e,2,t5_2qmjp

Seriously though its really not fun for a lot of us.  Especially in poorer or ethnic cultures where I come from where fun is much less structured and laid back board games feel like a very restrictive form of entertainment.  My SO likes games because hes not very good at just hanging chatting and board games help him socialize by not making his life and opinions the focus.   Party games like Cards Against Humanity and the like are breaking through to different demographics but generally fans like me arent going to go to gatherings or conventions.If anything this should only be a problem for people involved in the business or marketing end who want to expand their profit.

5457347,0,t1_cw954aa,I have played about  games so far with  players.My first impression that it is very skewed towards the vampires at this number. With three vampires it is quite common to get majority vampires. At low player numbers it is almost a necessity to have the priest which is a great way to combat the mark of the vampire and help regain some chaos for the villagers.We have also found that adding in the Tanner from the original game is quite helpful at providing some much needed chaos.Overall my impression is that it is a good game but it is less forgiving than ONUW in terms of picking cards with a good balance.,boardgames,cw987nv,2,t5_2qmjp

It feels like a drag towards the end so no one wants to play it any more which I understand completely.Betrayal at House on the Hill  Fun the first handful of times but once youve played a bunch of the scenarios it starts to get pretty stale IMO. Gameplay doesnt really feel deep enough to remain compelling once you start repeating scenarios.Robo Rally  I really enjoy it but its hard to find enough others who enjoy it to get a game going most of the time so I gave up on it.

I find that even though there is a lot of luck involved and very little strategy it is very prone to AP. Sometimes it takes forever before its your turn to play and when that moment finally comes you dont get the right colored cards for like  turns so your pretty much sit there and do nothing for  minutes.

All types of encounters have a particular affinity towards one stat. By playing around these affinities you can mitigate a ton of risk. Besides doing encounters randomly is certain to get one killed. ,boardgames,cwdervm,1,t5_2qmjp
5490355,0,t1_cwdeo74,gt I think must is too strong a word there though since you could choose not to say itNo thats exactly why they use the word must.  Youre supposed to say it.  Its kind of what makes UNO...UNO.If that wasnt intended they would have used may instead of must in the rules.  It would have been marked as an optional strategic choice.  But they were explicit  they use the word must.They also in the rules say If a player forgets to say UNO... to address the not saying it issue.  See the penalties section.  That emphasis on the word forgets is theirs not mine.  They dont say If a player forgets or chooses not to say it...  Its pretty clear from the rules that the draw two cards is meant to address the case of a human failing rather than a strategic choice.gt So nothing is directly stopping you from not saying it except for the penalty cards you could get by someone else noticing that youre on your last card and didnt say UNO!.Well that and your conscience.  Its true that you cant prove that someone else didnt really forget but theres an implied assumption that the players are all playing in good faith.  Anyone who coyly says Oops I forgot! when they didnt really forget is risking a lot more than drawing two cards theyre risking the goodwill of their fellow players.If you want to be able to strategically opt to not say UNO the best thing to do is just propose that as a house rule before playing so that everyone is playing with the same strategic options.  Its perfectly fine to do that so long as all players understand thats an option available to them too.,boardgames,cwdfzoe,2,t5_2qmjp

5499539,0,t3_3qeufb,I read your Codenames review. Very good I thought. I think this paragraph perfectly captures the essence of the game which most other reviewers fail to dogtLets pretend only the following words are visible on the table space wave cherry pants. With a smile I give you the following clue moon two So that means according to me two of those words are our teams spies and they are both related to the moon. So you might think space yes for thats obviously where the moon is. You are so confident that you point to it and after a moments tension I plonk our teams colour card on it revealing you were correct. But youre also thinking well its not immediately obvious which of the other words is linked. Does the moon look like a cherry because theyre both roundish? Do people wave at the moon? Dont you have to pull down your pants to moon someone? You think to yourself that pants are probably the most obvious answer. You can feel it in your gut you know how hilarious I find a good mooning. You dont have to use all your guesses every turn which is always one more than the number I say and a wrong move might give a point to your teammates or even worse you might reveal the assassin which is an instant game over for us. However youre feeling brave so you point to it and as I frown and throw a civilian card on it you yell Damn it Russell! because actually I was so sure you knew that the moons gravity causes waves in the sea that I feel a little stupid. I should have known pants was linked to the moon somehow if only Id been more careful!It does say teammates instead of opponents but is otherwise great.

Penalties might feel psychologically negative but they are the same for everyone and they are not that uncommon in other games.The real brutality comes from the interaction between players. The game space is so tight that everyones actions constantly affect the other players even without intention.This level of interaction and competition is quite uncommon these days where games allow you to perform well even without paying much attention to what everyone is doing.

They have a mixed reputation among pure boardgamers but are tons of fun.Of this list Id look at Hannibal Rome vs Carthage if you can find it Sekigahara War of the Ring and Hammer of the Scots which all would give you a lot of replayability. The first week I picked up HotS I played it probably  times against the same opponent. Other Columbia block games like Napoleon would be good options too. I like War of the Ring but I fear that it could lose its luster faster than the others depending on how much you love the source material.Mage Knight looks good but I havent played it.If you want something in the vein of TS  Dawn of Freedom or Wir sind das Volk! both look awesome.

So youre basically negotiating with other players for things that will help both of you while throwing maneuvers in to then drop them off. Most of the movement types give you permanent or temporary damage of a few different types the type really doesnt matter that much except during the event phase when having the most of a single type may.Pitting allows you to remove temporary damage but takes some movement off your moveThe rules are short similar in length to Urban Sprawl another GMT nonwargame very understandable and the game was a lot of fun when we played it with .

5727533,0,t3_3tfesy,I personally dislike Betrayal at House on the Hill. The haunt is generally horribly unbalanced so that any decisions you make generally have no chance of overcoming which side is supposed to win that scenario. Some people excuse this as it being a storytellingthematic experience but the story it tells is too random as well leading it not really having much continuity and just being too silly and stupid.If you want a storytelling or thematic game Id suggest Eldritch Horror or Gloom. Those are on far opposite sides of the spectrumEldritch Horror is a pretty deep involving game thats not too random and has great theming. Gloom is mechanically simple and kind of random but the storytelling onus is on the players who are capable of intelligently combining the events on the cards with past events that have happened to their characters to make a funny story that is consistent with itself. Gloom takes what people say about the winner not mattering in Betrayal and makes it actually true because the stories are actually good.If you were interested in Betrayal as a vsall game Id maybe look at Descent Star Wars Imperial Assault or Level  Omega Protocol but I have no experience with any of those games.,boardgames,cx721ju,2,t5_2qmjp

5815879,0,t3_3uum1e,Thanksgiving means family time which has come to mean games. It was a great week!My little sister was in town and asked to learn this Android Netrunner game Im so obsessed with. So I gave her my Stealth Kit deck and talked her through a game against my Argus. I gave her advice drew into no ice at all for the first four turns and had accidentally left x Jackson Howard and x NAPD Contract in my other Corp deck but she was still very satisfied with her win. Shes psyched to play again next time shes in town and even seemed to be playing with the idea of maybe buying a Core Set to see if she can bait some friends into playing. Fantastic.The two of us also roped my girlfriend and mother two different people just to clarify into three games of No Thanks which is always a good time. The other two had never played before so we traded wins for the first two games but Mom pulled out a pretty crushing victory with the last one so well actually be able to get her to play that again shes the worst sport I know.We spent Thanksgiving with some cousins so I packed a bunch of party games. Concept caused some raised eyebrows with its complicatedlooking board but its not a hard one to teach and definitely ended up providing some laughs. But that was nothing compared to Codenames. Codenames deserves all of its hype and even if I wanted to there is no way I could have stopped  games in a row from happening. Everyone in attendance played and everyone was Spymaster at least once. Ive never seen a game so perfect for a family gathering.Saturday was a whole different kind of intense as we played through March April and May of Pandemic Legacy. Man oh man theres another one that just lives up to every expectation. Every time we turn to the Legacy deck were rewarded with fresh horrors. The game were playing at this point still bears a passing resemblance to Pandemic but every single month adds more rules and powers and restrictions and generally steers you further from vanilla Pandemic and into a complex new nightmare.On that complexity After our last game I mentioned to my comrades that the Pandemic were playing now going into June is a game Id never ever want to sit down and teach people and just start playing. Its too complex theres too many moving parts and rules and exceptions. But the game is very very smart with the pace at which it introduces the new bits so youre always offbalance but never overwhelmed by new rules. Its elegant. I cant gush enough about this game and its already pretty high in the running for favorite gaming experiences.Questions No Black Friday stuff for me  the really good deals seemed to be on games I already have. Thats fine with me my Aquisition Disorder needed a break. The aforementioned Codenames and Pandemic Legacy are definitely definitely on my list. Forbidden Stars and Flick Em Up deserve mentions too partly for the sheer amount of pretty pretty bits in each.,boardgames,cxi0ios,1,t5_2qmjp

Given that your example included Race for the Galaxy Im not sure you guys want to dive that deep just yet so...Viticulture  In my opinion this is one of the most thematic games Ive played.  You feel like youre going through seasons and sowing the fields and aging the grapes and making wine.  Its also got some meat to it and I think it compares well to RftG in weight.Agricola  Some people dont like this game because its stressful. To me its heavily thematic in that youre taking over a farming family whos starting up  working the fields and raising animals struggling to feed themselves while still maintaining a hopefully prosperous farm.  Its also got quite a bit of complexity to it  a heavy game both figuratively and literally.Suburbia  This game is often described as Sim City the boardgame.  I think its got an approachable theme where you are each developing neighboring boroughs and competing to see who can grow theirs into the most populous and desirable place to live.

I would gently advise you to stop insulting the mods and being angry in your recent posts to the sub. ,boardgames,cxm3j24,1,t5_2qmjp

5848608,0,t3_3va5rr,I generally do learn the rules for a few reasons    They are my games that I introduce to other people     I like to know the set up as thats a big part of rules that is often not explained.    Im a good teacher of games better than most. I like to layout the winning requirements first and foremost and then explain what a turn looks like. Then Ill go through necessary details once they know the objective and what they need to do to obtain it.          Im also very happy for other people to teach me as long as they are good at explaining. Particularly if its some one elses game and I wont ever have to be concerned about the setup.    It is easier to learn as you are playing for the first time but you must have read the rules already and using playing to actually understand what the rules are saying.,boardgames,cxma4il,1,t5_2qmjp

5854529,0,t1_cxmzek3,For me I doubt I will miss the Guildmaster stuff. With the Inferno KS  plus reduced price Original Fall of Arcadia Beyond the Grave Pets and dragon campaigns available there should be more than enough content to last for years.

5869092,0,t3_3vn3tg,Here are some suggestions based on my experience with the games that I have played on your list... Theyre widely available and are not too expensive. Gateway I recommend Carcassone as an alternative to Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride. It is a tilelaying game that is simpler than either of your other options also has expansions that add complexity if you want it and can play more players than either.Bluffing My partner detests The Resistance Avalon. We instead prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf for secret role  bluffing games. Theres a free app that handles the game moderation and it plays a bit more quickly because you iterate only one round before the game is over which means you can play more often!Small card game I dont like Exploding Kittens. I think it does fall flat very quickly. If youre looking for something to take around with you I would suggest something like Hanabi which is a fun cooperative setbuilding game where you cant see your hand of cards but everyone else at the table can or Love Letter which is competitive but super quick and simple take card play a card. ,boardgames,cxoyvvu,3,t5_2qmjp
5869700,0,t3_3vlobf,Eldritch Horror plus expansions because its an excellent thematic coop.Splendor for lightweightfiller.Terra Mystica for Eurogame territory control.Virgin Queen for wargamesthat long GMT think tank probably has the most replayability of anything on the list.Battlestar Galactica vanilla for hidden role and traitor games perhaps Dead of Winter instead.,boardgames,cxp1rfr,1,t5_2qmjp

5877817,0,t1_cxq0mgr,Easy way to avoid the quarterbacking issue which can occur in any cooperative game not just Pandemic is to just encourage players to make their own choices. Preface with the game by saying that youd like to avoid having one person steer the whole thing. If someone ends up dictating all the turns remind them to relax and let the active player make their decisions. If you play with a person who HAS to be in control of everything all the time no matter what you say then maybe youll have issues. Otherwise just talk it out if it begins to happen. If all players are at least moderately competent the game is fine. I personally think Pandemic would be make a great gift.

5887154,0,t3_3vwg3g,For my gaming groups the games Ive been using as gateways to heavier strategy fare are Gold West The Voyages of Marco Polo Concordia and Keyflower. In order from easiest to teach to steepest learning curveThose are definitely not the most thematic but the Wild West prospector theme of Gold West has gone over well with newer gamers. For something with a bit more theme but still some complexity I would recommend Mission Red Planet most groups Ive played that with have really enjoyed it and if your group likes Citadels then it would be a hit too I think. ,boardgames,cxrc8hw,4,t5_2qmjp

5887916,0,t3_3vx4ux,In this situation I would say Ashes Rise of the Phoenixborn because it comes with  premade decks. But if you want the best multiplayer card game I would go with A Game of Thrones ed.  core set can play up to  people with Kingslayer rules choose  factions and shuffle them together ignoring loyalty but you would need at least  core sets to deck build or  cores to get a full playset  core is mostly ofs. v Kingslayer can be very swingy because its mostly ofs but Melee Kingslayer is quite fun because that swingyness is balanced out by the shifting alliances.,boardgames,cxrfu2p,13,t5_2qmjp

5899586,0,t1_cxswa1z,Yeah its hard to know how well youre doing for sure but its such a short game relatively  minutes? that I dont begrudge it that. And even if you knew how well you were doing Im not sure it would change your tile selection each turn very much. You typically only will be taking  of the first  or  tiles and when you filter out those that wont fit due to riverroadplacement constraints you usually only have one or two good choices. I also dont mind the point penalty since there has to be some mechanism to avoid someone simply scooping up every tile that another player leaves behind. I do take it on faith that the penalty is balanced but definitely dont mind that it exists.,boardgames,cxsywno,1,t5_2qmjp

Its harder to really discuss when Im coming from a defined standpoint and youre coming from a vague one. What modern games do you consider classics? Roughly how many would you consider classics?I guess I feel like if a game is good and stands the test of time but is not widely played it is a cult classic rather than a true classic. some games that I would consider cult classics Twilight Struggle Caylus  Paths of Glory Diplomacy Arkham Horror.,boardgames,cxt0782,0,t5_2qmjp
5900540,0,t1_cxsmvsf,Yeah I would consider inviting everyone every time and then splitting up. Especially since some of my friends should know a few of the games well enough. I attempted splitting up earlier when we first started the game night but the guys had no idea what to do when I tossed them Love Letter to kill time until we finished our game before we moved on to a larger group game. As the only one with kids though I dont know if my wife would like having more people over while the kids try to sleep and I dont know how the other hosts would be. Sometimes their tableseating arrangement is tight as it is.And as it stands right now its just the guys in our group of friends. Some of the SOs might like to join in but its been to make it kind of a guys night.Were having a bunch of friends over next weekend for a Christmas party. Im hoping I can make  Booms and a Room work.

And you can score your progress to try and improve it. I play with a few house rules to ease the difficulty some but its a great time filler when you want to do a little dungeon crawl. Please note that currently there are only so many rooms which you have a great change to see again and again as you descend. However they do scale as you go deeper.

5916742,0,t3_3wbggp,I think there are a number of good games you could choose. These are a couple of games that I think are approachable for new players who havent played designer board games they are the types of games I have seen sold in places like Target and Barnes and Noble for instance may be attractive to a yearold boy and can play a variety of different player counts. King of Tokyo is a good gateway game with a lot of dice rolling which generally goes over well with kids. Its also a game that can be played with adults and its not overly complicated.Ticket to Ride is a pretty safe bet when it comes to gateway games. Its a little less exciting than King of Tokyo but the gameplay is simple and easy to learn and the train theme isnt bad. Small World has an attractive fantasy theme and is a bit like Risk but with races that have special powers. It may be pretty approachable if he has played games like Risk before.Castle Panic is a cooperative tower defense game. Players work together to defeat monsters that are streaming in to attack the castle. This also has the benefit of being a game that can be played solo if he doesnt have a lot of other people who ant to play.,boardgames,cxv7sph,1,t5_2qmjp

Seems to come out every time we are playing games whether we are sober or not.

I still love it to death and my SO will tolerate it from time to time.I recommend rahdo since he only does two player games and its usually just my SO and myself for game nights.

I guess my only complaint would be I feel like its the luck of the draw as you start figuring out where to go next. There really arent many clues to know which location to go next. So its a trial and error game that relies a lot on luck to get through in a faster time. Also in The Marcy Case I didnt like how there were two ways to do a certain something. I felt they missed out on a whole area because of this. Again I struggle to come up with cons. Price wasnt an issue we split it  ways. Story and art was breathtaking.

Since they dont cost anything to play once in your hand the best card to choose is blatantly obvious. You scan the area that costs the least to scan if you cant kill anything if you can kill something you kill it. If a card that makes events more dangerous pops up you simple avoid scanning for a little bit. Ive played quite a few games of it and I never encounter situations where Im faced with a meaningfuldifficult choice. gtyou choose what to scan and when. what to attack what to scan when to use coordinate cards.None of those are hard choices.,boardgames,cy8avhb,1,t5_2qmjp

Whoever made the art was not remotely qualified to do so and the game suffered a little for it.My wife isnt a boardgamer so its tough to get her to play games in the first place.

6026450,0,t1_cy9fzfw,gtSurely your example about running into Cortex Lock could also happen in Magic where a new player doesnt know about card X or Y and gets stomped by it after a misplay? I feel like learning the card pool is part of learning any card game.Hidden mind games are inherently a part of Netrunner so it will happen. With Magic you only have to worry about instants and a player having an instant kill spell is to be expected. The reason why its much more painful in Netrunner is because good players know the meta so they know that they can run on hidden cards because they have an idea of what it can be based on experience. New players do not have such information so they may be overly passive on safe ICE or be too aggressive on runs that experts would know are obviously traps. Its like being in a room blindfolded and learning what is where by slamming your face into it.The play of Magic is a lot easier where you simply look at your hand play your play for the turn or hold onto that instant if you think you can wreck your opponent with it on their turn. Yes they could have instants but for the most part going through the motions is very easy. If they have a big creature out defending it is obvious to good and new players that attacking with your creature would be unwise as it would die to it. With Netrunner it would be as if you wouldnt know what you were attacking into which means you could have a horrible outcome or a good one. Im saying that good Netrunner players know the meta so they have some sort of idea what the card could be and can play accordingly. New players tend to be cautious because they are never sure how bad it can go. And my point with this is to explain why new players might have difficulty when they play Netrunner and why the overload of monthly card packs dont help.,boardgames,cy9l7jr,2,t5_2qmjp

If you open the bag you get  over me if you let the bag through I net  over you. Theres no bribe in the middle that makes any sense. If I bribe you  or less youre better off opening the bag but if I bribe you  or more Id be better off shipping legitimate goods.I know this is an extreme example but the numbers work out the same with one crossbow and four apples and the numbers are worse for the other types of contraband.,boardgames,cydxaom,2,t5_2qmjp

As your population increases it will cross over red marks on the track which knock your income and reputation down. Often times gaining income can come at the cost of reputation ie building a landfill or vise versa building a park.

I believe though that sheer number of ratings are required for a game to climb and thats part of the problem with niche games. Something like Red Winter is so niche that only people who know they will like it will ever play it and the average stays high while the rank stays low. Ghost Blitz is niche in that few people will really like it but not niche enough so that only fans will play it so you end up with people who do try it but think that it stinks.Your comment about expansions is definitely correct but Im not sure how that plays into the bigger question or if I am even addressing your point,boardgames,cyllvpb,3,t5_2qmjp

6124738,0,t1_cyjobw4,IsleBound Brasil and The Network are games Im unfamiliar with  but if you are excited about those then I should probably look into them.Of the cooperative games Ive listed the most approachable and with the greatest replay value is probably Eldritch Horror.  It should have been an  game but they split it up into a  and the  expansion Forsaken Lore which basically increases the base game card count.  The plus is you can buy in at a lower cost to see if you want to throw in the rest of the money.  All the expansions are very good for it and it works well with  players controlling  or  investigators each  ideal is  investigators.  Its not a zombie themed game but Lovecraftian horror skinned.  Meaning it doesnt feel like a Lovecraft story but more of a dark pulp adventure its set in the s and is well streamlined.  We lost to Azathoth so many times my wife almost quit playing this one  then I looked at a googledoc for win rates and played against Shub Niggurath with combat characters as it was the most commonly defeated enemy.  We won and she still plays the game.  This game really blends the theme and core mechanics of Arkham Horror with the wonderful double side unique cards of Mansions of Madness and the scopefeel of Fortune and Glory see below.  Probably my favorite and my wife likes but doesnt love it.  When I want to micromanage more I play Arkham Horror instead but that one can drag on for a long time... over  hours long.Castle Panic is a fantasy themed siege defense game.  It is more of a kids game without the Wizards Tower expansion and gets fairly challenging with the Dark Titan expansion.  With all expansions you are looking at the same price or less than my other favorites.  We also enjoy it but it is slightly too light for my taste  still good for a medium length game after a long day at work.  Thus this one has a place in our collection.  Oh dont get Dead Panic  its the zombie themed version of this game with a few twists on the mechanics.The third game is a lovehate relationship with Fortune and Glory.  My wife loves the game but for me I love the concepts and what it does but wish I got to do more for the time commitment.  Like Eldritch Horror you are looking at  hours commitment  and in that time I only get to do  temple raids and  vile organization raids. Still it is Indiana Jones the Boardgame with all of Flying Frog Productions campiness.  Photoshopped stage actors instead of artwork lots of dice rolling competitive and cooperative play modes extra bits that you can use to make your own house rules up lots of plastic tons of cards high quality but a little sticky... I had to sleeve them in order to shuffle them and this one has a wonderful pushyourluck mechanism where failure puts you in a cliffhanger that isnt resolved until your next turn.  If only I felt like I was doing more while investing all that play time Id love this as much as my wife.As to Brass it is probably one of our favorite competitive games.  We enjoy the fact that it isnt zero sum  if you use my industry we both benefit from it.  We also love balancing the short and long term goals  do you go for position or money take loans or generate income use the cards as is for  actions a turn or burn both to do the one action you really want to do.  I also enjoyed the app version but I always prefer physical games  still apps are a lot less expensive than physical copies.  I hope you are enjoying it.,boardgames,cylthpw,1,t5_2qmjp

Each session the chooser for the night will get to choose all the games we play be it one or more.  The only rule is they have to alternate new games and games weve played.  So if the person selected a new game for their previous day as chooser they have to select a game weve all played.  It cuts down on time spent learning rules.  Also we each kept brining new game after new game to the table and we never had time to play our clear favorites.

A bit of backstory  Shes an English major and had been trash talking for months about how she would destroy me in scrabble.  The difference between us is that when she plays scrabble she focuses more on the words than the board.  By that I mean she doesnt plan her strategy around the double word scores etc.So we played through the game I was up by a few points and she was on what was likely her last turn due to lack of tiles.  She placed some small word that I dont remember and it put her in front by a point or two.  I played another small word that I cant remember putting me back in front.

6144256,0,t1_cynzcb1,Sorry to break it to you man but quality isnt subjective.  If it was then everything would be considered good as pretty much everything has fans regardless of how poorly put together it actually is.  Take Twilight for example.  The prose is objectively terrible but its popular enough that the author probably never actually has to work another day in her life.  The same is true of the Harry Potter series.  People might enjoy them but they arent well written by any stretch of the imagination.  Same thing goes for movies music tv and even boardgames.Betrayal has shallow and repetitive mechanics and while the changing haunt does allow some variety it isnt enough to make the game actually engaging beyond maybe one or two plays.

For me as long as components dont get in the way of the gameplay I dont care too much what they look like.  Minis can get in the way of gameplay by raising the cost outside of what I am feel the gameplay is worth.  Kingdom Death Monster is a great example of a game that I dont expect to ever play because of the minis.  Obviously other people have different preferences and its great that there are plenty of games out there for everyone.When it comes to money Im becoming increasingly convinced that poker chips are generally the correct answer but thats not something that publishers can really include in a game.

6146285,0,t3_3zq9si,I really hated it the first time. I had no idea what to do among all the different options and in particular I overlooked the importance of getting lots of the same animal in your green areas. As such I quickly fell behind the people who did it right but the game went on for over an hour after getting into that state.I liked the game okay on later plays. Teaching it to new players I would emphasize the scoring point around animals because you can end up pretty bad if you dont do it. for the people saying they wish it were a shorter game. For example eliminate the building tiles and the specialrule yellow ? tiles so that even new players can be faster about evaluating their position and choosing moves.Im especially iffy about all the rulebreaking yellow tiles that are in there. A lot of the game revolves around getting the right yellow tiles for your setup but to do that effectively you have to spend time absorbing the entire set of rulebreaking tiles that are available so that you can plan around them.

I also like games that can be played solo for those evenings I really want to play but no one else is available. Love games with lots of story and theme to them and have long been looking for that ohsoelusive RPG in a box that effectively scratches the old DampD itch.Mage Knight is a great choice. Fantasy spells levelling up basic characters and all around great game. This comes out a lot solo it has excellent solo rules or if theres only two of us.Robinson Crusoe is fun with friends or solo. Not really any sort of RPG but one of the best games for generating a unique story every time you play. Kingdom Death Monster is awesome. Great solo or up to four players. It is absolutely hands down the closest game I have ever played that feels like DampD in a box. Only downside is the eye watering price.Arcadia Quest is fun for  not really for solo. Has a campaign that plays out over several sessions character progression and some interesting maps. Some of the ones weve tried that didnt gain much traction with us include the DampD Boardgames just didnt connect no idea why Shadows of Brimstone started off with a bang and then everyone got rapidly bored of the dull combat Pathfinder card game no interesting choices Descent nd edition cant explain it it just went over with a dull thud Omega Level  same ennui as Descent Munchkin  minutes of fun in a three hour game.,boardgames,cyp0lby,1,t5_2qmjp

I may need to play it more. Resident Evil was a good concept that just didnt feel like it came together well enough. DC Deckbuilder came across to me the same as Ascension.

You then have to flip over cards until you get the right one getting punched in the face every time you dont get the right card.

My only issue with it is if your experimental strategy is terrible but you eek out a win anyway you sometimes see your new players trying to emulate that strategy.

My husband teases me often because I will regularly hold off on playing my action until I have his undevided attention so I can show him an awesome combination. And it works the other way I want to celebrate with my opponents when they play a killer combo too.

Especially in a slot limited game if you can grab the trainer early eliminating the  discount milestone from other players going the triple hire route you can force players to either give up on a large section of the board or be forced to take on tons of salaries. I raced to the guru and then raced up marketeers to planes and radio. If you grab a food guy for your second hire on turn two you can also lock people out of the freezer and grab one of the  producers. This forces people to either fill up their deck with excess salaries money is points or give up on burgers or pizza.

I had almost nothing and no one would trade with me.I ended up getting a ton of development cards including  build  roads and  army cards. I also got a monopoly that I used to take all the stone they were hoarding from me and upgraded all  of my settlements to cities. At the end I just needed to add  road then play my  cards and I would win but one person kept extending his road  more longer. I finally got someone to trade the  clay that I needed I had to give him almost everything I had and as soon as he traded everyone yelled at him because I started smiling and I played all the cards and won.

If the store is busy they probably get a fair amount of resumes that are probably in standard resume format talking about other job experience. I think you should talk about your gaming experience as well. Maybe submit a second resume that focuses on conventions different board games what you like about teaching games why you are passionate about board gaming and how it relates to other aspects of life. I would reference and kind of explain what this is in your cover letter. Maybe answer the what is your dream job question whether or not they ask talk about how you would put in extra effort because its more than just a job its something you want to learn about to eventually take things to the next level. To build off what other people have said your actual social interaction is just as important than your resume. Make sure to be social happy. positive. While you are in the store talk to other people shopping check stuff out other than what you usually browse get to know every corner of the  shop. Ask questions about how often they get new stuff. Do they demo games? Ask about that. Even see if you can come in to demo something for an afternoon and let them see what you have to offer. Be pushy dont take no for an answer and as long as you are not bugging anyone working or getting in the way keep hanging around.

6255679,0,t3_418yb8,Ive found that modifying the game for first timers makes it a lot easier to learn. The beauty of DoW is in its complexity but that makes it tougher to teach. In the modified version for the first time other people play we take out the betrayer and crisis cards. Since there are no crisis cards everyone plays with one less die because otherwise the game would be too easy. It lets people focus on the main objective for the game instead of the round to round crisisfeeding the colony. In addition it is a little easier if you facilitate all the crossroad cards. The game becomes entirely cooperative like this so you dont have to explain the rules that much and a lot of the things you can just teach on the go. That way instead of explaining rules for  minutes you just start playing pretty much right away and can hopefully finish a quick modified game before playing the real thing.Other things that make it easier just give everyone  characters instead of having them choose. Consider not handing out the individual mission cards as well or selectively choosing mission cards that are easy to understand. ,boardgames,cz0par4,1,t5_2qmjp

Kingdoms has a fairly major expansion Heroes Call which I havent played yet but intend to add on to my TEW pledge  its supposed to be quite good and should make the game better.

It will be easier for the guessers the more related your connections are but theres a riskreward element as you try to increase the number of matches and the connections are looser as a result.Lets say your words are Spaceship Nut Tree Bat Boat.  Pine would be a good clue but the number you pick  would depend on the guessers.  Would they think about Chris Pine Star Trek or know that baseball bats are made from pine wood?  The higher the number you pick the riskier it is because if they dont know they may fumble around and hit the School assassin card for some reason.,boardgames,cz3oxp3,1,t5_2qmjp

6294638,0,t3_41rewu,Ill just comment on my experiences. I just bought Mage Knight. AFter watching Ricky Royals videos of the game I knew I wanted it. It has a lot of things I look for and love in gaming. But I havent played yet.I also just got LOTRLCG for solo play and played it twice last night. Now maybe it does get stale I dont know. I mean lots of games get stale over time thats why we end up with large collections. But anyway. Base set was . at CSI and personally seems to have plenty of stuff in it. It comes with four starter decks  and three quests...I plan on playing each quest through with each deck so thats  plays right there. Of course I wont have explored deck building but that will give me some experience with the cards. After that Ill probably start buying the small expansions you can use with the base box which cost less than  each. My suspicion is that I will have to slowly buy more cards in order to keep the game fresh I doubt the base box will be satisfying for  plays or something but thats likely part of the design intent. But anyway...I played it last night and had fun.Fields of Arle I bought this for solo play and have played five times now. Its very fun but would I recommend it? Hm well its not really a cheap game and Ive started thinking that I probably wont get more than ten plays out of it. Ill admit that setting it up and puzzling through it is a great way to spend an hour and a half takes an hour or less to actually play but setupteardown is a bit tedious. I realised the other day though that you could really play the game without even setting it up just work through it in a spreadsheet. Its the sort of game you can solve so once youve figured out the optimal set of  moves youre done with the game. So I guess if youre really good at it youre not going to get as much value. On the other hand it really is relaxing and pleasant and the components are top notch and I usually play while drinking some wine or whiskey.,boardgames,cz54not,2,t5_2qmjp

6309080,0,t3_42107e,I was like you in that I recently got really into the hobby for me about  years ago. I tend to agree with you on all accounts and am not personally a huge fan but I definitely get the appeal.For one thing Tom is a board game encyclopedia. Ive played a lot of games in my day but hes probably forgotten more board game titles than Ive ever gotten to play through. The sheer volume of experience he has is worthwhile especially for people new to the hobby. When I first started out I had no clue of my tastes or preferences so having someone who knows a lot and has that passion for gaming can help sway my decisions about what to get and what to stay away from. Others have mentioned this but TDT also has an enormous library of videos. Search for just about any game on the market and they already have a video for it its just insane. There have been several times Ive looked for more obscure games and TDT is simply the only place that had content on it.For me Ive gotten to the place now where I can have a very good idea whether or not Ill like a game based just on the rules or how it plays so having someone review it is less important to me. If I want reviews Ill check out Shut Up amp Sit Down because theyre just awesome. Most of the time nowadays though Ill look for a Rahdo Runs Through. Hes actually a bit more unprofessional than TDT because everything he does is fully adlibbed but he does an amazing job showing real gameplay which is much more important to make a decision IMO.,boardgames,cz6rsbo,4,t5_2qmjp

That being said it could work with two if you can avoid that and its a pretty great solo game since you dont have to worry about all that solo!

6357475,0,t3_42nco7,Great review. If youre open to anything that might evolve with your format I had some thoughts on the end comments. I felt that they were a bit unsatisfying.Two reasons. One very simple. You threw up some bulleted lists at the end that flashed by really fast. Sure I can pause the video. But it took me off guard. And they werent very clearly arranged. Like positives vs negatives or heres how you rate the following categories length replayability theme strategy etc..Second the video itself was very thoughtful about the game experience. But your recommendation was really quick general and vague. Any gamers except small box casual gamers? Sounds like an almost sortof insult to people that arent going to like Terra Mystica if they dont want to be called dirty small box casuals.I think you could elaborate. Even briefly. Saying things like this is a mediumheavy Euro game that isnt afraid of that label. Its all about number crunching and edging out your opponents in little ways. You must perform well enough in a wide variety of things to squeeze more points out of the board than everyone else. There IS conflict but its a very slowburning indirect  hey you blocked my next move kind of conflict. This game may be for you if a slower paced lightly themed strategy game packed with opportunities to earn points by building wooden bits on the board sounds exciting!,boardgames,czc9wj7,3,t5_2qmjp

6360032,0,t1_czcj4vh,Interesting question.Id say yes.Its a pure coop and it still manages to tell a pretty good story.I like the moments were we look at the board and say Ok things are getting out of control.Or the time my investigator got honeydicked by Nyarlathoteps sweet lies.Beyond that the game mechanically is good in addition to the very strong theme.  Much more so than either Mansions or Betrayal.  I must give credit though to Mansions fun story telling combat cards though.There is strategy of when to press hard on the mysteries which win the game versus controlling the board via closing gates which left open accelerating losing the game and dealing with the occasional plan altering horrific Rumors think of these as an early to mid game random side objective that if ignored can have horrific consequences.  Can you afford to spend time going on an Indiana Jones Adventure in hopes of scoring a powerful artifact?  Do you take that Dark Pact agreement for short term gain?Sometimes you get ground down in EH.  Sometimes you are in a game where you were certain you were screwed and you pull it out in the end.  Sometimes you win with  investigators going down sometimes everybody makes it.  Sometimes you get the Heart of Winter artifact against Ithaqua sometimes you kill and eat your own ally hey you were craaaazy hungry.I also highly recommend Michael Hunters  user made Ancient One scenarios.  They are thick with replayability and theme.  Youll find them as the highest rated scenarios for EH on boardgamegeek.,boardgames,czckc86,3,t5_2qmjp

6361786,0,t3_42sdjz,Thats interesting because my problem with the game so far is that the Godfather wins too much. But I can definitely see how that wouldnt happen if your henchmen arent correctly memorizing what was in the box. Thats a pretty crucial part of the game and if the henchmen cant do it then you might be better off switching to ONUW or Resistanceor Secret Hitler soon.If you want to just give the Godfather a better chance mechanically you can always add in the Cleaner so you have a chance of shooting any chosen agents. If its still too easy have a Cleaner in addition to the prescribed henchmen number instead of replacing one of them. Or hell just reduce the number of agents and drivers. That will all help but I dont really see how the game is even fun if everyone isnt memorizing whats in the box since the entire point of the game is giving contradictory numbers and having the Godfather sort out whats more likely. Maybe letor require people write down what they see in the box?,boardgames,czcrj0p,4,t5_2qmjp

6411147,0,t3_43gxz2,You have  directions with this. The first is to play The Resistance. This game is unbelievably tense and the reason why is because it forces people to lie and mislead others. The rules are simple and it plays fast. The caveat though is you need at least  to play.The other is to JUST KEEP PLAYING JKP!. You keep playing to learn the game to the best of your ability and then play substantially becomes better. It becomes incredibly tense and exciting as strategies get refined plays and counterplays happen and such.

Sometimes its the other way around. The scenarios you get in the game should give you a lot of play. The scenarios are created from actual battles that took place during WW and they provide historical context for you to read before each battle. They have two beach heads to storm. Why two? Because you can buy another board in the future and play both beaches and react the Normandy invasion in whats called an Overlord scenario So badass. I personally also have the Eastern Front expansion that brings the Russians into play. I cant say enough good things about Memoir.

If you like sandbox and creating your own goals throughout the game this game is so well made. The stuff you can combo together is incredible and the satisfaction comes from how much brain burning it took you to get there. The game can be puzzled out but there is some set up variety to keep it fresh plus your opponent will shake the game up. You cannot execute your ultimate plan because they will be eyeballing the same stuff from time to time. But there are so many ways you can play the game that every game has felt dramatically different. Finding new combinations and testing new strategies has kept me interested for many plays. ,boardgames,czrg4xp,15,t5_2qmjp

6556318,0,t1_czxg9tu,Everyone along the chain needs to get a piece of the pie to stay in business.   And a good rule of thumb is that everyone is looking for  margin at each step.  Usually your cost as a publisher is X.  You sell to distributor at X.  The distributor sells to retailer at X.  The retailer sells to the consumer at X.  So you can see that if a retailer wants to sell something at cost for itself its X and if it wants to make  margin its X.  So youll see that the MSRP sits somewhere in this range.  Some retailers have enough volume to accept lower margins.  Others like your LFGS need to have higher margins to account for lower volume.  Healthy competition at each step of the process decreases the amount of margin one can make at that step.  This is when you find companies integrate vertically expand horizontally for strong bargaining power or create a competitive advantage in manufacturing to decrease X.,boardgames,czxh6n0,2,t5_2qmjp

Like LG I would be interested in something that is not too rule heavy.    I worry that there would be no way to satisfy me with one game.  Games that I play with my wife tend to get a bunch of plays and need to be a little deeper than games with simple rules that I can quickly teach to new players when the player count expands.  I like King of Tokyo Escape and Carcassonne and I think all of these play well with multiple players but they are all too light as two player games.Additionally I think it is potentially problematic to play a game that one predominantly plays as a  player game with   or  lessexperienced players.

Before he had some pretty big mood swings and didnt deal well with losing but now were able to have a relaxed game in the evening. Overall hes much calmer and better focused and were kinda awestruck how much of a change this was and how the tension in the household has pretty much vanished.Evolution  I had somehow written this off and didnt snatch it up when it got put up for sale in the local facebook forum. My friend grabbed it though and Im glad he did because its a wonderful game. Simple with a great balance between strategy and tactics and Id love to see it published in my language.Warhammer Quest The Adventure Card Game  Fell completely flat. I dont know if it was just that the first mission is very flat or the keywords not very well layed out but none of us felt like wed did anything beside rolling a few dice without really knowing what they did.Rattus  Probably not at its best with two but after acquiring it with the Pied Piper expansion and some promo tiles I gave it a spin with the girlfriend. We played it pretty straight without sicking the plague on each other or using the roles much for the first couple of games but the mechanics are good and definitely something Id like to get to the table with more players.Suburbia  Its good that I sold a pile of thrifted games because Id be in the doghouse for all the acquisitions this week. Somewhere along the way when I got into the hobby I had written this off as too fiddly and heavy but when a copy got put up on the forum I grabbed it with the INC expansion. What a great game! I liked CoMKL but the engine building aspect and two player game in Suburbia are much stronger and my girlfriend loved it even though she lost by a pretty large margin.Inhabit the Earth  Acquisitions eh? I got an unexpected trade offer on BoardGameGeek and my girlfriend was almost too happy when I asked her what she thought of this game and if I should trade away Imperial Settlers. She gave IS a couple of chances but ended up hating it so Nations pushed it off the table completely. I like Keyflower multi use cards and racegames she likes the art so I think this has a good chance of hitting the table.

6601695,0,t1_d0237m2,That Catan result should have been criticized it basically became a waste of time for everyone else at the table right at the games end. gt Im thinking it would be better for everyone involved if we just find a more diplomatic way to deal with it. gt If board games were the only thing that mattered then it would be pretty simple to deal with this is shitty nobody else behaves like this I dont feel like playing with you guys anymore. But as it stands gaming is just just a fun thing to do and in every other way they are some of my favourite people to be around. So might as well find a solution that works for everyoneI hear this and I totally agree but a solution would enable the group to play every game it wants to in the future without issue. This sounds more like resolving the issue which is totally fine if thats what you want but I personally have an issue with tailoring future game nights to one entity simply because they arent willing to play a game fairly and by fairly I interpret that as theyd do the same things in that situation with another player as they currently do with their SO.Have you tried explaining it in that manner? If they favor each other in their decisionmaking how is that fair or as fun for the rest of the people at the table? On the flipside if they are fine with their approach then they should also be fine with the other three more or less ganging up on them. Because thats what their actions boil down to.I just dont see especially metautility in letting them carry on like that as its clearly frustrating to the rest of the group. Another thing you should likely consider is that if they like the way they currently play games what makes you think theyd appreciate games as much that dont allow them to capitalize on their relationship with one another like in that Catan example? It sounds like they prefer it when either one of them gets a win over anyone else at the table and if thats the case Id suggest theres little guarantee that theyd like a game as much where theyre on the same team against the rest of the table as it wont be as unbalanced as theyre used to. You dont want to spend money on a game that you dont even end up using as much because the two players precipitating the issue actually favor the games that allow their strategy to win more often.,boardgames,d026487,3,t5_2qmjp

6625569,0,t3_46eyoj,I sleeve everything. After years of playing Mtg sleeved cards just feel so much better both for shuffling and handling. After a few plays with a unsleeved deck the cards already feel weird like sticking together. And those were with Mtg which are of an amazing quality compared to the thinner ones from GoT or Netrunner.Also I like shuffling the cards in my hand like Kibler does and so do other people that I usually play with. You do that without sleeves and in a single play they are already damaged on the edges.One last point in favour of sleeving is that I cant control what everyone is doing around the table. Maybe someone is eating something maybe they have their hand a little dirty. Sleeves allow you to not worry about that too much and thus avoid looking like a control freak. Its good for other people too since damaging a card that is not yours is ten times worse than damaging a card from one of your games.Yes it is more expensive to sleeve but since I come from Mtg everything seems so cheap that I dont mind adding a bit of money in sleeves.,boardgames,d04n2ys,5,t5_2qmjp

If theyve historically undervalued and neglected this part of the process are they any good at it? I guess it remains to be seen whether a commitment to more playtesting will be enough to solve the problem immediately. Edit On reflection if this review is accurate and represents a typical experience it does seem to be chiefly a problem with quality not quantity of playtesting. The present issue isnt a subtle but broken strategy or a small imbalance that can only be found with lots of testing its something that three different groups agreed on when they first saw the game.,boardgames,d05zviy,6,t5_2qmjp

6654100,0,t1_d07c8p3,This one is fair I think  I dont mind Euro scoring mechanics though and Im a TI fan so long doesnt bother me.Android The Game is Amazing and Frustrating all at the Same TimeI think Ive mentioned it a few times already okay I know Ive mentioned it but Android is a massive game not just to design I cant begin to imagine how many manhours of time went into designing and playtesting the game but also to learn and play. Expect to spend anywhere from five to ten hours playing through your first session and expect that youll do something very wrong and not even realize it.AmazingAndroid is an amazing game for a number of reasons includingFantasy Flight Games managed to successfully build a giant new game in secret and get it to within weeks of release without word leaking to the public. Considering how many people were involved in the game and how game distribution works this is remarkable. From a purely professional point of view Im going to keep a very close eye on Android if this type of launch does well for Fantasy Flight Games then I expect to see other publishers follow the same tactic.The conspiracy mechanic is fresh and unlike anything Ive seen before. Giving players multiple ways in which they can influence the games story and build VPs means that no two games will ever be the same. When combined with the suspectevidence mechanics players can construct games in which The Media James Levy and Commissioner Dawn all worked together with Eve VATC to commit the crime. Sure that isnt what really happened behind the scenes but it makes for an entertaining ending to the game.There are stories hiding inside the card decks. The Choose Your Own Adventure approach to the plot lines as well as the snippets of flavor text on every card really bring across the feel of the world. In fact its almost sad that so much of the games flavor is spread across all of the cards since no one player during the course of a game will get to enjoy every part of the world. Still this is also a benefit since every time a player selects a different character at the start of the game he gets a look at a different part of the constructed world.The games production and component qualities are excellent. This is a highquality game that is every bit as good as any of Fantasy Flights recent releases if youre a component snob as Ive been accused of being then youre going to be very happy with Android.FrustratingWhy is the game frustrating? There are a few key reasons which areEuroscoring hidden inside an awesome theme. Barnes post at Fortress Ameritrash nails it when he says Theres no set murderer at the beginning of the game and who it is develops over time and isnt really resolved until the end of the game via a complex and strangely convoluted resolution system . . . Im already growing to accept this and understand the reasoning behind avoiding a Cluelike mechanic even since I started writing this review but it still gnaws at my mind. I think what annoys me the most about the scoring system is that during our session I realized This game would be great on a computer. Complex scoring systems get me down which is part of the reason that I almost exclusively play Carcassonne on the Xbox these days.One too many things to keep track of. Or maybe two or three too many things to keep track of. Android makes no attempt to dumb down the system and there are layers of choices built on top of the games Time track foundation. If you have a player in your group who suffers from analysis paralysis then do not allow him to play this game. On your turn you have to decide where to move which leads to follow how to use those leads where to place evidence tokens or puzzle pieces whether or not to draw discard or play cards and . . . well the list keeps building. Im hoping that Fantasy Flight will post some summary sheets since those would be a great help during the game.Long. Too be fair I think that the reason our game was so long was the fact that we were learning the game and as each turn passed uncovering some new subtle rule that changed what we wanted to do. This entry may very well be stricken from my list after another session or two but Im fairly confident that the first thing people will think after their first session is that the game is long.,boardgames,d07lb2i,3,t5_2qmjp

Im glad I didnt.  I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it and I think this is going to be our goto lets chuck some dice game.  The eventual winners who cares if people starve build monuments! strategy felt disconcertingly accurate. Epic  So this game promises Magic The Gatheringin a tiny box and it gets pretty close.  Its the second time in a week that Ive been a little disappointed that something was exactly what it promised to be Deadpool being the other.  Turns out removing the deck construction and meta from Magic doesnt make it better for me.  The good news I guess is that it doesnt make it any worse  it just turns out that theres other reasons I dont play it any more.  Still pretty fun game and if the guy I gave it away to ever wants to play again Id be happy to. I bet I could get a semifunctional version of Splendor set up with those materials so thatd be handy.  I wonder if I could paint legibly enough to make El Grande feasible... The longest game I ever played was a marathon game of Risk that would not end  I dont know how we managed it but we ended up in a three or four way stalemate and none of us could really gain any ground on the others.  I remember it going for at least five hours and I think we eventually just kind of...stopped.

6679761,0,t1_d0a0259,The Resistance is the most pure social deductiondeception game ever made yes even purer than WerewolfMafia.  The only thing you have to work with is how people are acting.  As resistance you will almost never receive hard information and even when you possess it others do not.  As a spy you know everything.  This forces you to make your plans and deductions.  You can observe behavior and relational tells using the yesno votes but the spies can always obfuscate and deceive.  Yet at the end of the day spies are driven by that need to put a spy on the mission because without one then they lose.   Its a cycle of reasoning deduction planning and then a single test if you were rightwrong then back again.  Wits vs. wits.  Every mistake costs you and the spies can even hide your mistakes as successes at a penalty to themselves of course.  And being right isnt enough you have to sell people that you are right.  A lot of people want to change the formula and its like changing Go.  Sure you can make other area control games but be careful when you say youre improving on Go.  ,boardgames,d0a8vb5,1,t5_2qmjp

Once we have Jacks trail We usually have two officers following the clue path directly trying to rule out branches. Two officers in front of where we think Jack is to reduce his movement options and hopefully force him to use up his special moves when he doesnt want too. One officer covering the back to put a bit of pressure on Jack if he tries to backtrack.We also dont expect to arrest Jack on Night One we just try to rule out the area where his hideout is. Narrow it down on Night Two and hopefully leave officers around the suspect area. And finally try to close in for the arrest on Night Three and Four.Isnt foolproof of course but its been effective so far.,boardgames,d0ao8p7,1,t5_2qmjp

Nothing from Rahdo Dice Tower Undead Viking etc. Since youre marketing this to a board game community have you reached out to these reviewers? Will we be seeing any rd party reviews of your game before the end of the campaign?I also noticed that your stretch goals are a bit intermingled which is really strange money goals vs. social goals. More strange however is that youve not even touched on the packaging for the game and you have no stretch goals to improve the packaging.

6704910,0,t3_47fpcd,Hey buddy. Ive only played Agricola. I did some intensive research between Caverna amp Agricola at one point. Safe to say it would come down to this Agricola Stressful especially for feeding your family. You have to focus on generalization. You need to make one of everything. But you always have a new  set of hands occupationminor improvement. No  games are the same. Interesting decisions amp the cards are mostly balanced out. If you still have a problem with it you could definitely draft it out first  I would highly recommend Gric. Caverna Have not tried this but seen lotsa reviews. Instead on forcing you on making one of everything. You are given an open sandbox amp you can do whatever you want to score points. Definitely not as stressful way much less than Gric. You have a static set of tiles so it is always the same on the board but the game will be different cause youll be trying out new strategies. There are a lot of tiles for sale so you might need to remember all of them? Then again Gric has always a lot of cards. In the end its up to you if you want an open sandbox to try out new strategies each time or a fun stressful misery farm with high replay value thanks to the cards. I would personally opt for Agricola cause I prefer a direction rather than something more point salady with the same static tiles.As for Le Havre amp Ora I would like to know more too.Im looking to maybe even get Le Havre but I dont know too much about it.,boardgames,d0cuge0,3,t5_2qmjp
6706221,0,t1_d0cxnod,. The Resistance   I think everyone plays this we have played a lot of it..  Wonders   Card drafting some like it some dont.. Shadow Hunters    Like Bang but better. Currently our groups favorite although it is one of the newer games to our group.. Coup Reformation   One of the few games that can support up to  and it still works really well with any number of players fast games.. Tsuro   Simple tile laying game we use for filler.. Antidote   Fun card game that supports up to . Someone in our group just bought it and everyone liked it.. Secret Hitler   One of my friends got the paper version and its just like The Resistance with a couple of twists. Extremely fresh take on pure social deduction games. I think were gonna play this from now on instead of The Resistance.Also quite a few games that go up to  like Cosmic Encounter w expansion King of Tokyo we probably play this every game night and Power Grid that we all love.Id love to hear your list I also cant recommend Shadow Hunters enough. I was skeptical when I bought it because its a Japanese translated game and Im not really into that genre but everyone always wants to bring it to the table.,boardgames,d0czbxd,1,t5_2qmjp

Theres plenty to chat about in game potential trades settlement placement how to catch up etc as well as the other things we catch up on. The its too based on luck thing isnt something I get either.

6714658,0,t3_47kuok,I love the Pacifist and the Claw.First off and this is superficial I know but I love the art for both of these. The Pacifist has a neat simple design that winds up incorporated in other areas of the game it shows up on the Parasite. And the Claw features the Leviathan in its art another way cool image!Mechanically I love that Pacifists get the most out of Negotiates. It really changes the dynamic at the table. And I LOVE that moment when the Claw snatches a planet. Its such an absurd overthetop shakeup without being gamebreaking.My two least favorite are probably TickTock if the game goes too long it just wins??

6779321,0,t3_48maeh,I will second Istanbul great pickup and deliver game with worker placement elements.  Fun light theme and plays quickly.Royals is a light area control game driven by card play.  Simple Mechanics and quick play.Lewis and Clark is a card driven race game with worker placement and very clever resource management. If you like Castles of Burgundy I think you will love Grand Austria Hotel.  Lots of similar mechanics but GAH ups the production value has a more engaging theme has a little more going on and is driven by a very smart dice drafting mechanic.The Voyages of Marco Polo is an excellent dice placement game where you are trying to hit your long term travel goals while also picking off contracts to pick up additional victory points.

But we were the only participants aside from the store clerk who was voluntold they would be running it who hadnt played before herself but had fun during our two gamesIm not sure how much business it will do for Barnes and Noble. The fact that they only announced that the event was happening last week was rather disconcerting. But we all had fun and plan to be back again. The games are exactly the kind of weight my game group likes so were enjoying ourselves.They did get some sales in their cafe off of us but as most of us already owned KoT no sale there.Well be back next week for Sheriff of Nottingham since none of us have played it before and it will be an inexpensive way for us to try it.  But if they want us to buy a copy it will be a tough sale given our access to OLGS or our desire to support local FLGS who sell the games at the same price as BampN.Its a nice service the promos are a cool perk but Im not sure how BampN can justify turning this into a regular event beyond the nights scheduled through March.

6816536,0,t1_d0oubxb,Thank you for your very condescending reply!It is indicative of a person with a closed mind who has not given this very much though. You say I make the game longer for no real benefit when I have explained the benefits clearly. This variant increases the value of the ambassador it rewards players with superior deduction skills it reduces the amount of luck of the opening hands by encouraging players to lie rather than be honest while holding perfect cards.I suppose it is objectively true that a missed coup adds length to the game. However the tension of being able to miss a coup adds a tremendous amount of gameplay depth to a very unexciting and uninteractive element of the game. Also a game of coup is what?  minutes tops? So maybe with a missed coup its ? So what? If the game is fun to play then how long it takes especially when we are talking about less than  minutes should be the least of your worries.Million people play coup and not finding problems? The BBG forums are OVERFLOWING with variants for this game many of them adding excellent gameplay value to the game. The v variant proposed there is HEAD AND SHOULDERS superior to the standard rules provided with the game.My group are dedicated coup enthusiasts who have logged hundreds of hours playing and analyzing the game. I have also played with strangers and I always present the game with this namethecoup variant and after they inevitably fall in love with the game I tell them the official rules and the response is always thats stupidWhy dont you give it a shot before shooting it down.,boardgames,d0oyaaa,-5,t5_2qmjp

Im not a MTG guy but it is my IRL Hearthstone. The game comes with plenty of cards which you will draft your deck from. Plus there are two expansions with more cards. I wouldnt classify it as a CCGLCG. The dice are used to gain and manipulate resources. The rules are pretty easy to learn and games can be played quickly. There is a lot of depth to learn from the cards but they are not as complicated as MTG cards. The theme is not all that great but the artwork is well done. The components are very nice.

Or for entertainment?  If for entertainment what would the goal of the game be?  For example Pandemic is a game dealing with diseases  but the games goal is not to explore the impact disease on family units or relationships.

6908028,0,t1_d0zbnxe,Its actually a really critical part of the game design! There are many games in which it will be advantageous for one player to stay still on one floor on a room in a corner where the guard on that floor has already been just so that the guard on a higher floor does not move as often giving the other players more time to get the safe cracked and find the stairs.Thats not uncommon thats actually a regular recurring possibility in every game weve played so far. Time is so critical that we always will have the players spread on the floors  even when theres not much left to do  just to make sure the higherup faster guards dont get to move as often.The point of the deck is twofold It creates incentive for players to keep moving making it a dangerous idea to simply sit on a single tile on a floor. This isnt adding punishment to more punishment this is actively disincentivizing one of the more powerful strategies in the game for buying extra time. And the deck simply exists as a means of adding a little bit of flavorful randomness and sometimes almost deusexmachina to a game whose narrative is one of the more important features.Ill give you that I was a little jarred myself when we read the You cant make meaningless actions rule because I can see it having some degree of subjectivity but weve found it quite easy to be able to tell when actions are meaningless or not  I like to use the old Hanabi rule  if it feels like it might be cheating it probably is. ,boardgames,d0zcewa,4,t5_2qmjp

6918717,0,t1_d0zryls,Im probably not the most experienced person but Ill do my best to answer some of your questions.Mage Knight is both a conditional victory and trying to get the highest possible score. In one of the scenarios you have to take both castles in order to win. If you do you add up your score and see if you beat previous scores. However in a game like Gears of War youre simply trying to beat the level. Mage Knight has a dummy player but it acts as more of a timer than anything else in the base game. Its pretty much there to make sure you keep moving. I cant recall a solo game Ive played with a bot but I know in a game like Gears of War you can control multiple characters. So I guess the answer to a lot of you questions is it depends. Different games operate differently there is no single answer. ,boardgames,d10k5w5,1,t5_2qmjp

6982267,0,t3_4bc204,Saturday night we started off with a game of Hansa Teutonica. H has won all previous games we have played though the last game she only won by a single point. I was super aggressive in that game pretty much blocking every route she tried to claim and daring her to displace me the whole time. This game I started off being sort of aggressive and then I just wasnt and lost the game by like  points. I managed to connect the two cities that give you  points but right before that point I was something like  points down and H ended the game a couple of turns after that. Her network of cities was just much better than mine. Oh well. Followed up with a best of three of The Duke with all three games using the Robert Howard expansion for the first time. This was the first time we had played with an expansion not including the dragon or mountain tiles which are included with the base set. It was pretty fun playing with the new tiles and I thought it felt pretty fresh. We played with the set up that has the tiles off to the side and as the corresponding tiles are pulled the player may choose to take the expansion tiles. The new tiles seem overly powerful until you start using them. Often the expansion tiles became targets themselves and usually got captured relatively soon after they were pulled from the bag. I had the best luck with Kull with his wide command abilities winning me one of the games. I won two of three. After finally getting an expansion to the table Im excited to play it again and excited to get some of the other expansions we have to the table. Sunday we got two games in the first being a learning game of Luna. We usually watch run through videos to learn a game but after watching the few we could find on Luna we were still left with no real idea on how to play the game. The first few turns were a bit rough but it did click after the first couple of rounds for me. I concentrated on building sanctuaries and H spent a lot of time sending Novices to the temple. I for sure made one mistake building a sanctuary I discarded a tile of the island the builder was on instead of a building tile but for the most part I think I played the game right. I think avoiding the Apostate is pretty important too I managed to not encounter him but H lost several points to him. I won the game by twenty some points but it definitely was a bit closer with my building mistake. Great game definitely looking forward to our next play.The second game was Castles of Burgundy a game we have played many times. We used the Monastary Boards mini expansion for the first time which can gain you extra points if you build in a few straight lines on your player boards. This was basically to my detriment. My castles were all along the edges of the board so I had to build up from there and I maybe spent too much time trying to unsuccessfully build from monastery to monastery. H managed to achieve all of the lines from monastery to monastery but I only achieved one. I started off focusing on farming and I had a lot of bad rolls using up a lot of workers along the way. H crushed me in this game. ,boardgames,d17s20d,5,t5_2qmjp

Among my favorites are Carcassonne Ticket to Ride Settlers of Catan and Dominion.  Its hard for me to divorce my favorite games from the games that I am able to pull out and play with people.If I can find the people and the time which is rare one of my alltime favorite things to do is a Magic draft. In fact that might be my alltime favorite in the entire board game space.  Some heavier games I enjoy include Egizia The Manhattan Project and Puerto Rico.  I just bought Blood Rage last night.

6985680,0,t1_d17y1yn,Pretty much my only memorable wins are Tanner wins. My favorite was I started out as the robber and stole the tanner. Right out the gate I claimed to be robber and claimed to have stolen someone elses card. People were claiming roles and more or less believed I was the robber. I decided to take a chance and claim to have stolen the person who was being reluctant to share info and that they were the minion. They were very confused why I said minion. And figured out that I must have stolen their werewolf and was pretending to be a minion so I wouldnt get killed. They confessed they were the werewolf and that I was the new werewolf. But then people didnt know if I was actually the minion and leading them down the wrong path. Eventually someone said that they knew I was the robber. So I could not have been the minion because otherwise the former minion would sell me out.I tried to backpeddle and make up poor excuses as to why I was actually the minion but really I was just killing time to look super guilty. Everyone decides to point and kill me.I flip over the tanner card and everyone groans about how theyve been had. ,boardgames,d1860z3,3,t5_2qmjp

7061214,0,t1_d1gqipz,Its a really good question. I think theres sometimes the idea that the more abstract a game is the less it should cost. This probably bleeds a bit into the idea of what value is and what part of a game carries value which obviously leads into the discussion of what is overproduced and all that. That said Im a pretty large abstract game not saying Santorini is as abstract in this form and have seen people rightly so in some cases post things like  for a few black and white pieces and a game board? etc. Bottom line value is totally different to everyone and theres no real argument here for that. Lastly considering what you can use your  for in re other games many people would rather put their money to a game or project that has more componentsartdepthgameplaydifferent mechanicetc. Again we cant really argue with that I suppose! Its sort of like opportunity cost in that light. Theres obviously a lot of nuance to why a certain person might feel a certain way about a certain price this is all Im getting for this? to I can get X game which has more depthfeelartreplaymechanicetc for the same price to many things in between.  ampnbspAll that said for a game like this the  including shipping is well worth it for me even if Ill probably still play with my custom board.

He didnt know the answers and said to stop back by tomorrow  we did so and he wasnt there anymore.  It doesnt seem like it should be that complex of a game.

Five Tribes I will recommend certain moves that block me letting them know that while that move might not get them the most points itll also prevent me from getting what Im clearly going for.

7091936,0,t3_4cjscd,I personally like TEK. Its not the best game in the world but it has its merits. Quick to play easy to learn small form factor no downtime and its a good intro to other boardgames for new players. Plus still surprisingly a lot of strategy and nuance. I didnt hesitated for a second to back UTEK. Not because I love TEK so much I needed to have two copies. But because this is the only game I know that is this portable and this cheap that isnt just another  minute card game but a full  minute board game that scales from  playersI mean thats fantastic!If you compare this to Civilization the Board game of course youre going to feel disappointed. But if you compare this to the hundreds of other  games that come in a box the size of a deck of cards than UTEK is truly a great game to own. I plan to get two copies.

Now your turn is over and you dont get to check the other words until your next turn.

Liked the game well enough definitely will be bringing on future travels.  Also interested in the fantasyretheme that has been announced. I can see this getting a fair amount of play.Hanabi  Much harder than it looks to actually be successful.  Out of  games we werent.  It was ok but I doubt well play it often.Imperial Assault  Got in the tutorial mission one day and a skirmish another.  Ordered  allyvillian packs already because I want to skirmish with Han and Chewie and RD and CPO ... This will absolutely get additional play but how much exactly is going to depend on my wife.  She likes it for now.  Battlestar Galactica  Didnt like this one seemed VERY repetitive with the lack of variety in cards. Very surprised that its as far up the BGG rankings as it is.Letters from Whitechapel  Played  full games twice as Jack and  partial game as Jack.  This ones a lot of fun but moreso as Jack.  I never go straight for my hideout but rather try to at least give the police a chance. Almost backfired last night in our incomplete game it took me  moves to get to my hideout that I could have been to in .  I had to backtrack across some of the spaces  times and my nd to last move was to use an alley to position myself in a spot between  police pawns with no escape. If they opted to not move Id have lost the game by not having any legal moves available.   Anyway I really like that this is a pure catandmouse game ... theres no combat theres no die rolling and it doesnt matter if you know the hideout is space  or  or .

If you happen to be pillaging a facedown token with that stat you could potentially be wasting an important battle card by winning or risk losing your figures in the event of a loss on a token that may be worthless to you. I would find that very annoying personally.I think a better variant on the rules would be to shuffle the tokens and disperse them randomly faceup after each Age. That way figures that remained on the board after the Age transition arent immediately on the good tokens with no one to stop them from pillaging them theyd have to use their first turn as a move action their second as a pillage and other players would have a chance to get some figures on the board in that time to try and stop them.,boardgames,d1rq0ty,2,t5_2qmjp

7179914,0,t3_4dtxx4,A euro game is a lowconflict lowrandom factor game focused on individual efficiency rather than outright competition.gtThe games we call Eurogames usually have very little luck and very little direct player interaction. Eurogamers react to dice like Damien reacts to that chapel visit in The Omen. These are games that will have you setting up efficient little economic or military engines on your table like a right little Nazi. These are games that usually wont allow any players to be eliminated because BOOHOO THATS NOT FAIR. These games will be gentle with you. Reiner Knizia is one of the bestknown designers of this type of game. His games are often mathsbased and often shite. The Eurogame style is often pushed as the beall and endall of quality gaming. Ticket to Ride is a game that is known as a gateway game to other games. Yes. Other Eurogames maybe. But building a fucking train track hardly prepares you for spewing bullets at an Ork. Eurogames are also commonly about farmers camels bits of fruit planks of wood koala bears and slaves. None of which are very easy to get passionate about. It often doesnt matter what a Eurogame is about though because very rarely does a Eurogames mechanic express a games theme well. Dr Knizia please stand up. Eurogames are the board games you can play in polite company over a bowl of wine and cheese flavour Monster Munch. There are however some spectacularly brilliant games in the Eurogame style. And the definition itself is ridiculous anyway so ignore everything I said.From here,boardgames,d1uaiw8,14,t5_2qmjp

When you go away to college and leave your Monopoly set at home what do you need to buy?  A new Monopoly set with your College or favorite TV show theme of course!  When parents are ready to graduate their kids from Candyland to a family game what are they going to turn to?  Yup you guessed it the game their parents introduced to them at that age.  When you need to get a birthday present for someone who likes games?  Buy them a Monopoly set with theme that you know they like.  Sure they already had  sets but this one has The Simpsons on it.

I am local to Strategicon so it makes complete sense for me because it winds up being cheap and if I really want to I can push it by driving home each night to sleep in my own bed.  The larger distant cons are things that I would enjoy for the spectacle but the associated costs are the real limiting factor for me on that.  When I do go I treat it like my vacation for the year.  It means that I am not only playing games but I get to meet up with like minded peoplefriends I have made on the internet in a larger scale.  Something that I normally wouldnt get to do on a standard vacation.  Still it is very expensive for the travel.  If GenCon were in my back yard I would go there in a heartbeat and not think twice about not attending Strategicon.  If you have a strong group on like minded gamers in your area that can also reduce the appear of traveling to play with as of now strangers.I think that the interwebs response to your initial comment may be more so due to the fact that you did not mention the travel cost for foreign conventions being the confusing part.Keep playing games.  ,boardgames,d1xiaq9,1,t5_2qmjp

7308345,0,t3_4fgwft,Cant think of any instances of companies paying for placement just on the components of a game but there have been a handful of games with releaseseditions sponsored by a company. The most famous would probably be Das Wasser des Lebens better known in English as Whisky Settlers. It was a rethemed printing of Settlers of Catan from  made specifically for the Glen Grant Distillery company.The honest truth is that unless the game is already a big hit it just doesnt make sense for the company to sponsor a game like you describe. Most games are not very successful and the point of advertising is to be seen. If a game sells about as well as your typical game it would be worth so little from the advertisers perspective that the sponsorship deal would not even make a dent in the printing costs.,boardgames,d28wqhw,1,t5_2qmjp

When I play games I go for the person who it makes the most sense to attack and in doing so often times people will think Im targeting them.  In return these people then go back to target me and I have to explain my case on why attacking them wasnt personal it was just the best move.  Sometimes it works sometimes it makes me the target for the rest of the game and sometimes those grudges carry over into other games.  So I just deal with it and actually enjoy it because often times convincing people to change their plan is half of the fun of these games,boardgames,d29jypb,1,t5_2qmjp

They are great. If he never writes another I will be sad but my life will not be any worse off.

7325816,0,t3_4foikj,Theres going to be a lot of based on taste thing but Ill give you my personal opinion emphatically not.  Stone Age is simple enough to veer into simplistic.  Very little changes over the course of the game.  Huts are quests that offer no gameplay changes point only quests  the boring ones.  You cant play a card to hinder your opponents.  Resource collection has been streamlined many of the spaces will use resources interchangeably so theres not too much pressure to make the right action.  Its all very predictable.  If you want a good Worker placement without crawling too far up the weight chart Id say that Spyrium is definitely worth looking at.  The entire placement mechanic is quite brilliant and it plays quickly.  Same guy who designed Caylus and it shows.  Really underrated gem and you can usually pick it up cheap.  Youll find theres a lot of decisions regarding how on the grid you place that will make the game feel very different from Lords of Waterdeep.  If you want to run up the complexity tree a bit Keyflower and Agricola are both moderate weight worker placement games that have a lot of subtle nuances.  ,boardgames,d2aw8dz,1,t5_2qmjp

I love it though.The game is not overly complex though it looks it at a glance and I adore the theme. Managing a balance between happiness and intelligence in your workers is pretty cool and turns are very fast as often youre placing just one worker or recalling some workers. Being able to bump workers to take an action is cool.I like that you need to decide how and where to increase your influence while bearing in mind you may just be helping your opponent.The recruit cards give you some cool unique abilities and there are far more of them than you need in a single play adding a lot of variety.

Your analysis of those two games as convinced me not to get them and stick with Agricola.

7402309,0,t3_4gol5g,Ah Dungeon Lords! Czech Games sent me a copy of this one and I finally got to play it for the first time last night! I really liked it. I read the rules two nights ago and was surprised by the games complexity. In fact I thought itd be so complicated that it might be a hassle to play.Im surprised to find I was wrong as with most games its much easier to play than to learn and after just one or two rounds the wife and I had a pretty good flow down.DL is the third Vlaada game Ive played and Im continually surprised by his impressed creativity. I love the concept of playing against the gamepreparing something to defend against the stuff that the game throws at you. Galaxy Trucker and Dungeon Lords both do this and I think its an awesome mechanic.    I almost see Dungeon Lords as the grownup big boy version of Galaxy Trucker. In both games youre building something to brace yourself against the game but Galaxy Trucker is chaotic and seemingly random and pretty simple. Dungeon Lords takes respected and elegant modern board game mechanics and does the same thing but demands up front that you use your best skill and strategy. To me theyre both two sides of one coin and Im glad to have both in my collection. As for the two player game...I played with two players last night it was my first game and I highly enjoyed it. I can see why its obviously better with four but I didnt find it to be unplayable by any means.However we kind of twisted it. To keep things more simple we just chose three commands for the NPCs at random from their decks while still maintaining the three inaccessible cards rule. We then put them around us on each side so theyd rotate in between our turns like a four player clockwise game. We stuck to drawing one card at a time. Are there any reasons why we shouldnt play like this? I can see why the actual rules would be more strategic but this worked for us just fine. Any thoughts?,boardgames,d2jldwa,2,t5_2qmjp

7424914,0,t1_d24aovp,Heres the secret for understanding Innovation Its not a civilization development game.  Its a tricktaking game.Its not about developing your board.  There is no engine you can build on turn  that will still be paying off on turn .  The cards and the situations they exploit are too ephemeral.  Hardly any card lasts for more than a couple uses.  And there are vanishingly few situations where cards combo off of each other.  There is no macro line of development strategy.Its about tricktaking in the form of the achievements.  If you have a card that will wreck half your board into your score pile... you do it and take that achievement.  Every card is as expendable as an ace taking a trick in Bridge or whatever.  Its a race to  achievements just as sure as your Bridge contract is a race to  tricks.Once you realize that yes you realize that Innovations theme doesnt match its gameplay.  Your civilization shouldnt forget mathematics beacuse you learned how to use coal.

7449332,0,t1_d2ox1mh, hours! Now thats dedication.As for the variant this was one of them We havent played our variant in a while and we had tweaked it a bit from one we read online but what I remember included. Players choose either a hero character card or villain card and plays as that faction.. Two lineups are created one from each set that are placed parallel to each other. . When a player buys a card from one line up it destroys the card across from it this added some interesting strategy where you could deprive opponents of certain cards.The rest is a little vague. I remember that we also had a super villain and super hero stack to defeat. We decided at the start of the game whether players had to defeat cards from the opponents stack e.g. a player with a villain card had to destroy super heroes and vice versa or whether they could only defeat the faction they belonged to. If the former the card was destroyed. If the latter the card went into their discard pile. Each one adds a different feel to the game.. Attack cards only affect players from the opposing faction.. Once one side defeated the stack they were going for the game ended and they would gain bonus VPs I think it was  to each player of that faction. Winner was the team with the most points. Obviously you need an even number of players. Three would throw off the balance quite a bit so Im not sure how youd balance it out in that case.,boardgames,d2oxx97,1,t5_2qmjp

7456882,0,t1_d2phyot,Wow i would love to hear why you hated the game! for me I thought the entire idea of the game was really smart. It was truly an experience that I have never felt before. I loved the feeling of what is going to happen next? That question of do we want to finish the game and try to win or do we lose the best way possible was an idea we all fought and toiled over. It was a truly incredible feeling for me to come into a new month of P.L and know something is going to be different and it may drastically change the way we are playing the game and that fear was amazing. I LOVED THAT! like for game end upgrades our team built spoilers a military base in all  areas of the map thinking we will have that objective completed to focus on the rest of the objectives but worrying maybe next month we wont need to build military bases. surprise surprise p . that feeling of doubt and wonder was truly amazing. I loved almost every moment of pandemic legacy until November personally. as I stated above I really wish they did some sort of split November objective that would really change the game if you have spoilers Searched and found the vaccine before the start of November I November was Really easy for us as a team because we only worried about the October objective and cure objective to win. and we won easily I think the heart of pandemic is that it really is a rnd focused game that you are trying to control every month in your favor. trying to guess what is coming up next what is going to be useful what isnt  who isnt useful that was a once in a life time experience for me. I would love to play the game again but i think it would have to be new people. I would love to see peoples first time experiencing this game and keep quite as they racked their heads around what is happening and why.

Or maybe it could be a Dust Bowl Okies game like The Grapes of Wrath or Oregon Trail The Board Game because I like the idea of traveling with very few resources. Its probably Eminent Domain Escalation because of the change in starting goals and positions. It makes the game so much more replayable. Tuscany adds a lot of good stuff to Viticulture but Viticulture is great without it and I enjoy what Cities amp Knights adds to Catan but even with CampK its not fantastic.,boardgames,d2pxx1u,2,t5_2qmjp

7466334,0,t3_4hlar3,About five or six plays in for me... definitely a winner thematically and its a great combination of difficulty and randomness for a coop where otherwise the wife and I regularly kick the crap out of Forbidden IslandDesert or Castle Panic.That being said though Im starting to question the playercount on this bad boy.  players seems like too many to handle in these small buildings. Even with the typical advice of splitting up between floors and such a x grid feels really tight when that guard die gets up to  or higher.I havent played solo yet but Im really looking forward to that. Being able to slow the game down a bit and focus on stealth more than rushing and guard manipulation. Maybe its the cat burglar in me but it does kind of ruin the thematics of the game when the guard walks right into a room with multiple people in it and all it costs you is a couple tokens.I even had a suggestion from one of our players last weekend that we should come up with a house rule for subduing a guard if he comes in a room where hes outnumbered or if youve got the muscley character. Not sure how to make that interact with the other guards though.Somewhere in the back of my mind Ive had ideas swirling around about a companion app and how much more flexibility you could put in the game with it. Random tile layouts of varying sizes automated guard decks that match with the nonx layouts and even a solo campaigncareer mode where you could hire additional characters to help you on missions and build up to that Hollywoodending final heist before you ride off into the sunset like Al Pacino watch out for that young turncoat Ed Norton!.This game really gets your imagination working overtime!,boardgames,d2qvjn7,1,t5_2qmjp

7468939,0,t1_d2qwufw,Ive played each of the  scenarios with  different groups. If I can put together a rd I will. In the nd plays of each I have to sit out of the actual puzzlesthough so far weve only seen maybe  real puzzles where knowing the answer means you cant participate at all next time. Spoilers for which things I mean and how they went Spoilerss The labyrinth amp pentacles in Asylum and the gears in PoD. When the nd group didnt get the labyrinth on the first try I did offer to begin giving hints but remained very vague e.g. It could be solved in  TU. when enough TU had been used that puzzle has a limit they asked me for the solution. For the pentacles my nd group solved it in a few minutes with my lips sealed while my st group ended up never actually solving it amp rationalizing a different solution since we only had  unexplored location left we kept adjusting until the numbers added up to its number. In both groups multiple people were able to figure out the gears. Most of the time its no different from being a GM who knows whats in the dungeon but cantwont tell the others how they should be preparing or playing a game with secret informationyou let the other players take the lead amp actreact only to information that group has discovered. Or if you do any roleplaying at all youve got experience making sure your characters never act on OOC information its the same thing. Some of the time I really really had to bite my tongue and hold that poker face while we all walked facefirst into a bad situation. Other times my nd group figured out on their own on the st run something which took the st group  runs to realize.Minor spoiler for characters in Asylum nothing past character selection Spoilerss If you get into the roleplaying aspects of it it isnt too difficult. For example in Asylum there are at least two characters who due to their psychological problems almost have to follow the other characters around rather than taking the lead one of them is literally paralyzed with fear so with my nd group I made sure I always played one of those amp roleplayed it so Im not making any decisions here just following your lead and playing it out made total sense.So yeah sometimes you have to play dumb. But you still get to play it outand like I said initially its a very different experience with different players. The core mechanic of dont read the card aloud read it silently amp examine the illustration then relate what you experienced to the group ensures that. Example a spoiler for the very first location of Asylum Spoilerss For example when my st group started Asylum the player who talked to the nurse in the Day Room related it as She looks like Nurse Ratched and says its just a normal day around here but well be able to find her in the Infirmary later. whereas in my nd group a different player reading the same card looked at it and said She says everything is normal around here and that we can go to the Dormitory or the Promenade. As you can imagine things played out quite differently for each group from there. And then whenever possible I selected different cards within locations than Id seen before so I could relate my actual first impressions of the artwordsbut its also kinda fun to relate details from the card which you know arent relevant but which seem like they might also be worth sharing but its coop never intentionally withhold obviouslyvital info!. The locationchanging mechanic also helps  of the time as the Time Captain breaks all tiesso you just keep your mouth shut and Time Captain plus one other person  decided vote... but roleplaying also works e.g. if youre playing a forestelf ranger and you havent been there yet always vote to visit the forest or if youre playing a plucky reporter looking for a big scoop always move your character first to things that look like they have information you can research.Finally I also chose carefully which group I wanted to run each scenario with first one group is definitely more into horrorsasylumzombies so went through Asylum amp Marcy together first with them but the other group are all DampD players amp Fantasy fans so I ran with them through PoD first. Since you dont know whats coming amp can react totally freely in your first play this can make a huge difference in how that and all future plays go for you the more into the tone amp setting everyone is the better T.I.M.E. Stories plays and if your first group hits the nail on the head you can do a great job leading in terms of tone amp immersion with future groups based on that great experience.tldr A little playing dumb but not as much as youd think. Mostly just keeping quiet at key moments andor roleplaying.,boardgames,d2r685b,2,t5_2qmjp

7551284,0,t1_d304g3i,The replayability is high because  Its a  out of  maps game campaign which winners choose the order of each map which adds variability  The respawn mechanic adds variability to each session uses dice to determine placement... which forces different playstyles usually.  Some maps you may focus more on PVE or realize you quickly have to go gank someone else because  minotaurs just plopped into your path.  You play teams of  characters which changes strategy pretty heavily which adds infinite combinations each time you play Loot between campaigns is randomdraft based and each level has its own set of cards.   You are playing against humans... which changes each play drastically based on what is happening Everything is a dice roll... which... being luck based... also makes for high replayabilityThe game is also significant in that it plays like Kemet in which most of the map is accessible to all players in a very symmetrical way and the end game conditions are fixed and designed to end faster.  There is very little delay the game playstyles. There is some sameyness to it but no more than something like WizWar which also has a lot of variability due to the spell decks and just the interaction between players.

Dungeon Petz  Despite this game doing nothing for me I bought a copy because my wife who isnt super into games said she loved it.  The zero plays this got over the following years made me regret this purchase and the purchase of the expansions.    Escape Zombie City  When escape didnt really work for me I thought this would do it for me. It IS better... but the core issue with the dice is the same.    Mare Nostrum  Expensive out of print got the expansion too. Fell totally flat. The auto win thing was so so dumb in my group.

7616131,0,t3_4jmrzz, yes for  main reasons.. I have someone limited space on the table  feet by  feet that I game. This reduces the table space required to roll a die and not knock into anything else. Really works well here.. It takes away any form of cheating. When someone rolls a die out of their hand and doesnt even roll over while not many people I know would try to cheat the system it completely abolishes any idea of cheating while rolling dice.

7618013,1,t1_d37vnbl,I had a friend over to play Commands amp Colors Ancients one time. Theres a rule where if you get any hits on a unit with a Leader in it but dont fully eliminate the unit you roll  dice to see if you kill the Leader as well.  Leader symbols and hes dead  probability only seen it happen twice in  plays of the game apart from this one. I watched as he held the two dice in his palm jiggled them slightly so that they rotated a couple times but did not actually shuffle themselves. The Leader symbols were quite obviously touching his palm. Then he turned them at a low height from the table so they basically just flipped over  degrees.  Leader symbols. Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me. He looked so pleased with himself too.I have social anxiety so it would be really hard and take a lot of effort for me to simply say Dude that was a bullshit roll please roll them again and actually shake them around in your hands a few times instead of gently rotating them in your palm. And hes sometimes a confrontational person so that makes it doubly hard. I suggested we could roll them into the box at the beginning but he just kind of shrugged it off and said we didnt need it. So I really could use a dice tower for situations like these but I hate the idea of me having to spend money just because my friend does not realize how to roll the damn dice. Is it really that hard? As a side note I have similar reservationsanxiety about asking people to please not mess with cards. I dont get the urge people have almost universally to rub cards against their chin bend them in an arc as they hold several of them pop them you know the sound you can make by putting pressure on them and sort of... popping the middle of them? etc. Drives me nuts but I dont have the confidence to just ask people to stop most of the time at least. The absolute worst situation in this vein that I have had to deal with was when my brother spilled tea all over my brand new copy of FFGs edition of Tigris amp Euphrates. That was bad enough and at least the components didnt really get damaged but not one week later my sister was playing with me and my brother and I told her what had happened with his tea earlier in the week. She might have even been there too which would make this even worse. She was having tea as well and put it on the table next to her. I urged her to please put it far away from the game or on the desk behind her or something to be careful. She just sort of glared at me in her usual way and said I know I will be. Again my social anxiety spiked on me and I was too afraid to be more assertive with her. Needless to say as she reached for the tile bag or something she ended up spilling it all over the game and it was even worse this time. I was so upset that I just stormed off to my room. In the moment I felt like nothing even mattered and it was already ruined. They cleaned it up pretty well and now most components are just fine a little water damage here and there but I dont care all that much at least about the components that are still with the game. One black  piece got ruined and split apart and one treasure piece somehow just vanished though. Thus if I ever wish to play the Advanced side which I do I have to find some stupid replacement for the treasure piece you need  and I now have just . I really like the looks of games when they are very pretty. I think TampE is a pretty nicelooking game overall. One stupid yellow cube on a temple would sort of ruin it for me. Yes it is still totally playable but come on. And none of this was my fault because I cant honestly blame myself for having really bad social anxiety when a situation arises in which I have to tell someone else what to do. Im really picky about the condition of my games. Its not that Im super materialist or something I just want them to be playable in  years. I love this hobby and the disrespect people give my games drives me through the wall. If you lent someone a DVD youd expect it to be returned without scratches that ruin it. Likewise if you play a card game with someone youd expect them not to mark one of the cards which frankly ruins any card game with hidden information pretty much all of them. Youd expect people not to spill a drink on your game and sully its pristine condition. Ahhh now Im just angry about all this again. Sorry for the very long tangent but I felt it was vaguely relevantalong the lines of stupid things other people do that mess with your gaming experience.TLDR  Friend is terrible at rolling dice but doesnt realize it dont be a dick and bend other peoples games cards my game got spilled on twice and Im still upset. ,boardgames,d384my5,-6,t5_2qmjp

7619797,0,t1_d38bgpr,It fixes Events in my mind by changing the way theyre added  per player as well as adding some Events that I REALLY like.It adds some new roles that have some fun ones the Archivist and a few more questionable ones but enough to add some more variety that can make the game more interesting.It adds the Virulent Strain in which Epidemic cards will begin to target one specific color disease and add even nastier effects to it makes the game harder but more satisfying imo.It also adds in a Mutation disease that you can play around with which is a fun game mod as it behaves much differently than the base four diseases.Honestly the bioterrorist and the mutation modules are easily the least interesting parts of the expansion  the new events are excellent and the Virulent Strain epidemic cards are really the best part of On the Brink.,boardgames,d38bxu6,2,t5_2qmjp

Second half is over  years of writing RPG series for Portal Games Neuroshima universe Monastyr Universe De Profundis game etc  Im a  RPG player and this was my main thing before board games. TWOMTBG in a large extent is a mix of the two genres.We work separately on TWOMTBG but I am and will be connected with Portal in . I treat Portal as my family I helped to shape it from the very beginning. Currently I am cooperating with Ignacy on an extremely curious project and we already have something BIG planned for next year  it will be connected to Neuroshima Hex. Staying on that topic I hope I will have a very cool surprise for you connected with TWOMTBG next tuesday. If you would like to know a secret I can tell you that up to this day Ignacy didnt play TWOMTBG and I didnt play his First Martians  both of us TRY really HARD to push the boundaries of story in board games as you surely observed that it is now the main thing for tabletop industry gaining momentum as we speak.And I myself wait for the final Cry havoc version! ,boardgames,d3d2btj,1,t5_2qmjp

7671027,0,t1_d3e2pf9,I dont tend to have a set group but when I play with housemates one targets based on previous games that Im not okay with e.g. Coup.I feel like a game should be played in a condensed vacuum where point scoring is the main goal. Taking an action solely to screw is of course out of line but as stated if I have a choice of actions Im taking the one with the most net advantage to me. Say Option A gives me  points hurts no one. Option B Gives me  points but hurts John weakening his nd place or Option C Gives  points hurts Samantha moving her from st to nd. I will always always always take Option C  it cant be argued Im choosing to target someone I choosing between bad options and giving myself the best chance it just happens to hurt someone else.Intentional screwing with no benefit to yourself is out of line if theres a benefit to you I dont even count is as screwing them. If theres also NO actions left to take that benefit you then Im going to hinder another player who may reach me e.g. Im st in your Burgundy example and have nothing I can achieve. I will take the ship from nd place. This might not be feasible but Ive never played CoB so yknow.,boardgames,d3e5glb,1,t5_2qmjp

But near as I can tell hot on the heels of GenCons announcement that theyd be actively promoting diversity someone who has GenCon GenCant Coordinator That was an unfortunate misread in their twitter bio tweeted something that could be interpreted as a call for the community to begin policing what and how people play for offensive or insensitive content.  Because what better way to be inclusive than have everyone policing everyone for anything offensive.  Its worked sooooo well in every other community.After this people sounded the alarm that Gencon might be going to go full thought police.

If that boils her soup wait until she plays games like Chaos in the Old World Cosmic Encounter or Battlestar Galactica.With that said Race for the Galaxy does this job well for me.

7741940,0,t1_d3m3oqr,gtFor me thats akin to saying if its not music from an established label it cant be good.  Or if this video game is from a new developer it cant be good.   Other industries have beaten this stigmaThrough the power of digital distribution and low low prices.Digital distro is key here. It reduces the effective cost per copy to zero. Compare a board game music album and video game. They all cost ten grand to create the IP. Now how much more money does it cost to break even? Music? Video game? They sell online and theres no real unit cost. You can discount it to a dollar and still make money. You can give it away free and it doesnt hurt you. Your revenue amount stays flat.This makes it a very low risk investment for users. A buck for a song.  bucks for an ebook. Ten for an Indie Game. If it sucks youre out a little bit of money and say lesson learned. That lesson was cheap.    Compared to taking a risk on a hundred dollar board game... Board games? To earn back that k you need to spend... Another k. On manufacturing. And you cant discount it. Or give it away. Not without actually going negative and losing more money. There is always a distribution cost on board games because they are a physical artifact. Music video games and books are  pure INFORMATION. Aside from app versions which are video games a board game is an object.  And that makes the cost of distribution nontrivial.Thats why the stigma remains and theres A LOT of stigma around KS games too its just harder to see through the cheerleaders. Because its a considerable investment to make on an unknown. But d printers would solve the digital distro issue! you might be thinking. No it wont. d printing is not cheap. And not fast. A chess set of HOLLOW pieces will run you  in material alone not to mention printing time easily days. And in the end... Still no board! I can buy a cheap chess set for less faster. Even POD doesnt use d printing. Its way too expensive,boardgames,d3m7ap5,2,t5_2qmjp

At least up to one I stopped playing adding an entirely new class of cards dependant on a specific currency leads to a situation where players find that they are either severely behind if they dont have a Potion or that the Potion has little to no impact and is a stagnant treasure in their hand.I dont perceive any problems if you combine it with Seaside or Prosperity.

7751118,0,t3_4lgzf5,Short answer no to Cyclades yes to Kemet.Core system of Cyclades is the god auction. Each god gives a very important and very specific ability wage land warfare sea warfare economy VPs. With five players all abilities are in play every turn and lots of interesting things happen. With four players you remove one god each turn randomly. Note that a god cannot be absent two turns in a row this way. Game is still fun but there are occasional somewhat boring turns as a result limited actions.With three you remove two gods every turn and its possible for a god to be absent for two turns in a row. This vastly increases the amount of dead turns where things that would advance the game are absent.Kemet at three or more players is about the chaos and mayhem that ensues when you have multiple players unleashing their power and fighting each other nonstop. More players means more chaos. More chaos means more fun. More players also means more downtime. Important thing to note is that while the board scales with player count power tiles dont.

Also I dont have much spare space for more large games.You can notice I didnt even mention playtime the game can last  or  minutes  or  hours!

7773120,0,t1_d3pp486,I like these ideas youve got me convinced on horizontal I must say. My main concern here is that any more than two buttons on either side and youve just got buttons that are narrow in a different dimension. For Magic and a lot of the games thats going to be totally fine a  and a  counter should do especially with clickandhold functionality and swipe functionality drag your finger over the number to increase or decrease if you want otherwise just use the buttons. I only see this being an issue really with YuGiOh.I also like the idea of a horizontal default with a toggle switch for those who might prefer a vertical layout.Thanks Ill do my best to have this all in an update this coming weekend.

7775330,0,t3_4lp9go,I played  A Distant Plane  This was a  hour play of a heavy simulation of the Afghanistan War and you really do get a feel of submersion game where I played as the coalition.  It was really tough and the timing wasnt purfect but somehow I pulled it off.  Last Will  This is a fun little game where you have to spend all of your money the fastest to win.  I played with the expansion Getting Sacked which added some initial short term objectives and replayability to the board.  Fury of Dracula  In this game one person is Drakula and the rest of the investigators are trying to find and defeat him.  Its constant frustration at not knowing where he is and finally in my case the relief of finding and finally killing him.  This is not really my type of game but IMO if you like this kind of game youre better off playing Star Wars Rebellion which feels the same but rather than all vs one its one on one.Neuroshima Hexx I like this game already and this time played with two expansions making it a  player game.

7784382,0,t1_d3r06y0,My favourite area control game. Good amount of conflict both direct and indirect. Lots of being a mean bastard to your friends who are all too eager to return the favour.Downside is that you need exactly four players. Expansion supposedly works well with five but I havent tried it. It also requires active balancing by the players. Sometimes a player can get severely beaten by another player or an event sometimes a player can be sneaking for a big lategame winning move. Knowing who to punch and when and when to leave them alone for a round is a skill that takes a few games to develop.

Bringing me to my question  Ill look at it later but maybe that one guy who has obviously playtested it can s ayc how does the market changes compare to the changing supply and demand system from the BGG mods? I felt like that pretty much solved it since getting the fame for selling the cargo meant that the planet wouldnt take it anymore so you couldnt just win from good setup that way.Edit I have backed and have seen the new econ system and its different than the custom fix but is better because its a lot more predictable and easier to plan around.

Its less punishing you have more flexibility to make up for mistakes as you can pay more corn to move around the board or let the wheels ride to get an action of your choice.  It plays great with two as you just place some dummy blockers on the wheel.  One of the things  I love about it is that its very visual everything every player does is clearly in front of you so its easy to bounce in and out of if youre distracted... though it does require a fair amount of planning ahead its just nice that you  have the visuals of your workers spinning on the wheels to track it.,boardgames,d3thcfo,1,t5_2qmjp

It has no rule book and is extraordinarily vague concerning what it is offering other than minis. Dungeon crusade however has hours worth of set up new game mechanics and play through videos. I think the comparison is utterly unfair and to compare a committee made game for a video game fan base with a unique dungeon crawler borne of one creators passion and dedication is disingenuous and shows a lack of care when researching the two. Please try to keep an open mind and give it more than just a prejudiced glance. Judge it on its own merits and qualities and not another games weaknesses.

7861691,0,t1_d3zlxbv,Youre not making it understandable youre simplifying it down to the point of meaninglessness.For example play a card for its text or take one of three actions is also a mostlyaccurate summary of Red.  Red and Twilight Struggle are remarkably different games in their weight playing times presentations and goals but your summary covers both of them.  Thats not a sign that the two games are similar but that your description is overly vague.Yes Twilight Struggle is carddriven.  Its a good introduction to provide a framework for the rest of the rules.  But WITHOUT the rest of the rules you cant play the game.Here are enough rules for Scrabble so someone could sit down and play it Draw seven tiles from a bag and place them in front of you so your opponent cannot see them.  They do the same.  Play goes clockwise. The first player must make a legitimate English word consult the Scrabble dictionary for disagreements about what constitutes a legitimate English word out of some or all of their letters vertically or horizontally with one tile covering the starting space.  Every subsequent word must make contact or intersect with a previous tile and ALL words created must be legitimate words.  Blank tiles are wildcards which may represent any letter  the letter they represent is stated when placed and it remains that for the rest of the game. After placing a word replenish your letters back up to .  Previous letters are not discarded.  You may use a turn to exchange some or all of your letters but if you choose to do this you may not place a word during this turn. Score is determined by the numbers on the letters with modifiers for letter and word doubling and tripling only counted on the turn those letters are placed. The game ends when all letters have been played or when there are no more possible plays to be made and all players pass.From that explanation someone will be able to sit down and play a game of Scrabble from beginning to end.  Its not a summary its the rules in their entirety from memory anyway.  That is a very simple set of rules.Id like to see a summary of rules for Twilight Struggle that covers all the information someone will need to play a game from beginning to end without having to look up new information later.,boardgames,d3zq42x,2,t5_2qmjp

7872374,0,t1_d40v9g3,This is exactly it. I dont usually back to be cult of the new I back because I want to support the industry going forward. Scuttle is a great example of a game that would have been swallowed by the likes of ANA CMON or any other large publisher but by using kickstarter a designer was able to make his own small boutique which he now plans to use for several more games. I back because I want to see things like this happen. We as a community should support ideas that are unique from designers who are unknown andor new to the industry we should look at crowdfunding as a way to support an idea or a mechanic which is innovative new or in some other way appeals to us. When we use Kickstarter as a preorder system were not only relying on a model which has turned the video game industry into a DLC paid content nightmare but were supporting and encouraging the actions of large game publishers to release boardgames that are incomplete without a pledge or preorder. But at the end of the day its all about supporting the little guy. Backing the guys who cant back themselves or who dont want to be beholden to the larger publishers. Sometimes that doesnt always pan out for the supporters but more often than not a successful KS from a small company is going to deliver maybe late maybe not quite what you expected but they typically have the drive to thank their supporters with whatever they were offered for their pledge.,boardgames,d40xdyi,23,t5_2qmjp

They really are fairly comparable to most other games out there. Besides now youre arguing that the problem isnt that they arent in the retail box but simply that they arent available for sale. hardly. the amount of exclusives of a single game beats all promos from some publishers. and addons ! exclusives.gtBesides now youre arguing that the problem isnt that they arent in the retail box but simply that they arent available for sale. because a people compare boxes and b then check the cost of what theyre missing.plus my argument was that even the promos you mentioned are  cards or figures TOP  thats on a whole other level than  missing from cmon boxes.gtJust dont compare retail to Kickstarter  they give Kickstarter backers an amazing deal and retail buyers a good one. The retail box still has more stuff at a better price than other products out there. Im happy to compare it to a retail game that you think offers a better or deal though. The incomplete argument holds no water though. thats a silly argument. its good if you dont compare it!  really? following that train of thought I dont have to mention any other game because retail buyers still get a good deal for most games. gtThe incomplete argument holds no water though. to quote myselfgttry to explain someone why his cmon retail box misses  of the plastic others got thats where the incomplete comes from.,boardgames,d41gyy8,0,t5_2qmjp

Climbers follow patterns not suit melds sequences etc. and can go around and around. Climbers often focus on going out first whereas trick takers focus on winning tricks everyone goes out at the same time anyway.So even though you call each round of play a trick I think these differences make the types of game feel very different. So calling Tichu a trick taking game is like calling Poker a rummy style game because you try to make sets but that is misleading if you are tying to describe the feel of the game.,boardgames,d4206vs,1,t5_2qmjp

There are not as many rules as in ASL. And yet this is the biggest monster game out there for a number of reasons.The game is detailed to a degree no other game has come close to. If using the full rules you keep track of every individual plane and pilot in the three year campaign. Each counter on the board representing a ground unit is composed of many units which are kept track of on logs. Supplies are kept track of and dispersed in a very detailed manner.From the rulebook we read how to run a game. CNA is a logisticallyoriented game and its play requires not only a lot of attention to logistics but if you will a logistically sound methodology. It is suggested that you have  persons per side with the following duties.CommanderinChief responsible for strategic decisions and to settle intrateam disputes.Logistics Commander In charge of all supplies. Accepts supply requisitions from the others and keeps all informed of supply shortages. Is in charge of supply dumps Third line trucks and some second line trucks and is in charge of Naval convoys.Rear Area Commander Gets the supplies to the front. In charge of security reserves prisoners and construction.Air Commander In charge of all planes and pilots.

8012430,0,t3_4oyk9o,Chess x   Always up and played whenever me and my girlfriend have some free time in the morning and last week was a good week to flex with our work hours.  Carcassonne x    Afternoon wine with friend. I find this game the easiest to introduce to people who dont play much.  Takenoko x   Played after Carcassonne cause that same friend got keen on the tilelaying mechanic. Also easy intro game and amazing dynamic in my opinion. Finished under an hour which most people can bare. I have also gotten really good at explaining it with enthusiasm which is all thanks to the comic strip enclosed in the box. the whole package is just great with this game.  Settlers of Catan x  evenings  I play some. I mean I love games but most of my friends dont. I invited them to play Catan on friday cause I got it on my birthday a year and a half ! ago but have still not had the chance to play it. It has scared away the mildly interested and been considered too simple by the ones I usually play games with. anyway friday was fun cause we had dinner and got into it quite fast. the whole dealing part took way too long for the ones who had wine for dinner and it ended up taking four hours to complete one game. I am of course happy that I got the chance to play but I felt I needed to get deeper into it. invited a couple that is super experienced Catan players and we finished in about  min and it was really great. Got damn it is a good game! Im looking forward to buying expansions for this already.  Question  This is a hard question but Ill say Infinity by Corvus Belli. It just really felt like something I could get into but that It also would mean that I would need to put a lot of my other interests aside so Im cheap and lazy and borrow armies whenever I play.  Question  I wish my dad would have been more into games when I was young so Is say all of them. just having games at home is inspiring and I remember making games after school and how fun it was to figure out how games can work. The list above is games every yearold can learn in an hour so I think they all fit in a home with children. Magic the gathering is probably also something I will introduce my kids to.

Despite what others are saying here the Machi Koro base game is very balanced just not for new players. The problem is that there are runaway avenues to dominance that if other players do not block the game is over. When I play with friends everyone is constantly blocking each other from exploiting a stack mechanic and it leads to some very interesting games that ultimately come down to how well a player navigates through the available cards to maximize coin yield.

The fact is your team has no way of verifying that your clue has anything to do with what they said.

AEG springs to mind and Superfight was there.  Geek Chic was also set up and selling some dice towers and such as well as demoing their tables.  Speaking of Geek Chic they ran an event at a nearby hotel where you could check games out of a library and play on their tables.  Selection wasnt great but it was a nice detour from the madness of the big hall.Overall Comic Con is not really a great place for gaming related stuff.

8127467,0,t3_4qjugx,Mechanically speaking FCM is really good. Ruleswise its not that heavycomplicated. But you have so many options and the game is so interactive that no decision comes easily. Its one of those game that I keep thinking about after I played it. And despite taking  hours to play time seems to fly by. Furthermore it is surprising thematic which makes it easier to teach.The negative about FCM is the cost and component quality. Everything is functional but a bit clutteredfiddly. You will want to printbuy a milestone board so you can avoid using the milestone cards take way too much table space. You will also want to buy a card accordion to keep things tidy while playing. Thankfully BGG sells both for  USD on their geek store. Lastly food is constantly being produced and discarded. To limit the fiddlyness and to ensure you dont run out of game pieces print off a food track for each player. As far as Panamax Ive played it several times and still want to play it... but find it difficult to get tabled. Half of the issue is it doesnt scale well you want to play it with  players. But other than that it feels a bit clunky thats because the rules arent exactly elegant and the game takes a long time despite the limited number of decisions in the game For a hr game players will have  actions and a few partial actions.  But overall its such a uniqueintriguing decision that I want to keep playing it. Unfortunately I dont consider it a great game... the contract cards can really limit your actions and introduce an unsavory amount of luck into a heavy euro.

Still not sure if I really have a clue what is going on but I think I am getting the hang of it. So far I am just playing all  factions solo in the short game. Youd think that would introduce tons of bias to it but since every group has a separate motivation and set of victory conditions if you stick to those you will eliminate a lot of it. Really engrossing game so far and complicated but not insanely difficult to get your head around. Also played one solo game of Glass Road. I need to play more and get the wife playing too but my immediate impression is that this is a really solid solo game. Very clever and satisfying.

8171278,0,t3_4r7x3v,Both Castaways and Progress Evolution of Technology had too short of life due to the lack of expansions.  Castaways is basically a more deterministic version of Robinson Crusoe with a single scenario and an interesting chooseyourown adventure mechanism that adds cards to decks Progress Evolution of Technology was kickstarted with the vision of expanding the game but that never happened and Id be surprised to see it happen at this point.The expansions I am hoping for are the long awaited  Ages expansion.  The designer had open heart surgery in February  and last updated in August  that the expansions should be expected in .  Unfortunately the forum replies have been dead and it looks like the focus is on an October  release of World in Flames collectors edition...Id love to see the Ogre Pocket Edition Reprint get a GEV reprint... but thats probably a pipe dream.Star Trek Fleet Captains could use some small expansions  more vessels for existing factions new minidecks maybe some factions for smaller races and so on.

8182257,0,t1_d507y2l,I cant speak for expansions. I also strongly disagree with the use of solvable because in the field of computers playing games that implies theres a solution that will guarantee a win. That said I do agree that after a fair amount of play you can learn a series of decisions that will optimize your chances of winning.Obvious ones include Treat the cube cities as early as possible so they dont outbreak Taking care of spots that might have chain reactions Dont spend too many cards on directcharter flights as that makes it more likely youll run out of time.Less obvious but perhaps more vital strategies that come up with time Counting the time until the next epidemic might hit and being aware of what cities will outbreak soon after the reshuffle. As the game goes on you can let the lessdangerous cities outbreak and save the actions for getting cards together Dont worry about trading cards for the first round or two wait until you have enough player cards in the game and you can figure out the path to trading for a cure. After the third epidemic comes each card will be drawn a maximum of three more times and that third time will be very near to the bottom of the player deck. A city that youve treated down to  cubes at that point can almost always be ignored a city at  cube will not be outbreaking until the end of the game Adjust updown if you have morefewer Epidemics I assumed . Dont waste time running to the far corner of the map to treat a city thats not going to cause problems until the end of the game. Dont use events especially resilient population until youre required to or you see a specific tactical use for them. Played as soon as you get them theyre usually just okay. Played at the right time theyre gamechanging.With a thorough understanding of the odds and being able to differentiate which areas on the board have the capability to make you lose the game you can usually focus your actions towards very specific goals. You wont win every game but theres usually a set of principals you can go by that feels a bit repetitive after a while.,boardgames,d50byud,1,t5_2qmjp
8184090,0,t1_d50f693,Its really all about where the costs lie when the kickstarters happen and how long the development cycles are. Video games are looking to fund development because up to  of their costs are development oriented. If you want to do all digital distribution you can push your indie game for . on Steam and let Valve take their cut with  up front cost to move your product though now youve got a rd party taking a cut on each sale  much like a board game in a retail space. So video games have to seek funding to support the actual development efforts where theyre experiencing cost for wages art licensing etc.In a board game setting the bulk of the cost is actually production and transportation. Many board game designers have said they got their start designing in the evenings and on weekends while working another job or going to school. The time commitment while still potentially huge is far more manageable not to mention a company is far less likely to come after your board game than come after your video game code when youre working on it while working for a company. Board game designers chase funding for this expensive fulfillment process because without the likes of crowd funding many of these designers games wouldnt see the attention they do now.More than that though development vs production theres also the way the industries are built. The advertisement industry has really gotten its hooks into the video game industry you need game play trailers you need cinematic trailers you need tv spots and whole site adds on the wikis that are loosely related to your game. If youre kickstarting a video game you dont typically have enough content to do that effectively and your target audience is digitally diverse some on wikia some on ign some on gamefaqs etc. Board game designers have it a lot easier the expectation is much lower make a text post on reddit maybe add an imgur album so we can see the pretty or better yet just link us to your campaign page post a banner on BGG and send a prototype to several reviewers who you think might like your game  Watch It Played Rahdo Ricky Royal Undead Viking etc. This is a much lower cheaper barrier to entry and your audience isnt nearly as digitally diverse we traffic a lot of the same sites we share posts from BGG here on Reddit and we share posts from Reddit on BGG theres a lot of talk with in the community because even if my friends dont Reddit when we sit down to game I ask them about the latest campaigns. This really impacts how much visibility to the appropriate community youre getting.The last thing thats interesting is that the comparisons for video games can be brutal Look at this FPS by this indie designer it looks terrible in comparison to CoD or Battlefield. Board games are far more forgiving This game has really cool X mechanics the art could use some work but its in my favorite genre. Sure that may be over simplifying but its a sentiment Ive seen a lot in the community. Were more accepting not just in our gaming groups but in our games.,boardgames,d50k8cr,8,t5_2qmjp

By the time that has been explained I move on to the most finnicky mechanic  fields. I show players where the fields are delineated how many points each one scores and how to combine the elements. ...

Admittedly thats lead to a very large collection ish but we get plays of almost all of our games.Thats really the factor that determines whether we get rid of something whether we play it or not. Games cycle in and out of our collection all the time. In fact right now were talking about dumping  or  games that just dont hit the table. We recently built a new gameroom and stocked it with Kallax shelving and I think that would be our only hard limit on game buying. If when we max out our storage space well start having to set rules on getting rid of games to make room.Thats a ways off though I think. ,boardgames,d5894m2,2,t5_2qmjp

You dont need to own a street though No trade allowed EVER. No one can bid on the land when someone dont buy it when they step on it. No jail exit until you roll double.

So if youve played San Juan or at least Puerto Rico you will have a head start in learning RFTG. In all three games players choose a roleaction and then all players perform that action with the player who chose it receiving an additional benefit. One reason why Race shines so brightly vs the others is that each player chooses their roles simultaneously as face down cards and then reveals them all at the same time and then all of those rolesactions are played out in a prescribed order with all players buildingtradingproducing at the same time.The  player game allows each player to choose  roles per round instead of  and this is why it can play so rapidly.,boardgames,d5c9j3i,0,t5_2qmjp

8284128,0,t3_4sw74m,I think the issue is that the rules arent as clear as they should be. Examples would help. There is really only one action the Consume Action that is a bit difficult. Other than that the euroglyphics are useful once you get the hang of it. It is a good strategic game. There are two criticism I have for itIt is more like multiplayer solitaire even more so than  Wonders. You are doing your own thing building your own tableau the interaction comes with what action you choose at the start of your turn because everyone will be able to do that action. The interaction comes with trying to figure out what actions your opponents will choose so you can piggyback off of their decisions while your choices should benefit you more than everyone else.The other one is that the card draws can be a bit random and sometimes you get combos that are overpowering some that are useless. The good part is that it plays quickly so these balance out. It works very well for  players and while I like the expansions they arent necessary at all. ,boardgames,d5d2ps8,1,t5_2qmjp

8388330,0,t1_d5q2q15,so ive been doing some research this afternoon and it seems that i definitely got it wrong. You are right in that when you move an automa piece it moves to a space it does not already occupy. I got that massively wrong. So that was my first big mistake. My second was that i didnt see that the automa pieces can kind of teleport to the next available space through other automa occupied hexes. I think both of these things added up together to keep automa hidden in his little corner!!apparently automa is pretty aggressive in his take down of the map so it sounds like you probably had it right. I didnt find the star count to be that difficult. I always find with Scythe that you dont really get many stars at the start but then smash out like  in  turns late game. So automa had  stars when i hit ....whether that would be different if i had moved him correctly! i dont know...,boardgames,d5q37ka,2,t5_2qmjp
8388812,0,t1_d5q49pf,Well it is one of the games I ended up giving a  to on BGG. Its a heavy worker placement game that meshes wonderfully with the theme and is darn pretty to look at. I personally find it much better when played with the expansions but that can be challenging to teach brand new players. There is a lot of stuff to cover in just the base game alone so I find it best to get people to play a game of that before jumping into the bits that make it wonderfully deep and exciting unless you have a group that can handle it. ,boardgames,d5q5dmr,2,t5_2qmjp

I think perhaps the confusion is in the meaning of StandAlone? There are two products. The first is a StandAlone Climate game integrated fully into the base game. Standalone games in general are not designed to be combined with other games or expansions they stand alone as their own thing. The second product is the Conversion KitExpansion. This is the modular product which allows you to more easily add those Climate components to your base game much like Flight or our future expansions.Because youre interested in support for future expansions I can confidently say that youre not the type of boardgamer for which the StandAlone game is intended.,boardgames,d5syt71,2,t5_2qmjp

8493635,0,t3_4w1d18,Diplomacy.  Need I say more?Okay Ill say a little bit more.  It wasnt the usual he betrayed me now I hate him! stuff.  So I was Italy and did the total alliance thing with Austria where we didnt even bother leaving units on Ven and Tri.  Unfortunately Austria wasnt fully committed to the alliance and their lack of support pretty much left me crippled with nowhere to go by the end of .  Still they had been my only ally at all and hadnt outright betrayed me so I was inclined to help them while I was still alive.Then Turkey came to me with an amusing proposition.  Because of some shenanigans I ended up with an army in Tyr being dislodged with both Ven and Boh available for retreat.  The obvious play there was to retreat to Ven to protect from the pressure from Pie.  Turkey instead convinced me to go into Boh.  From there I marched into Sil and did what I could to cause trouble for Austria and their German ally while Turkey and France tried to take advantage of it.Austria was pissed.  He got angry since I was helping Turkey our enemy before I was crippled and hurting my ally even though it wasnt helping my own position at all and was clearly just being a dick.  It was at least a year before he talked to me again.I still stand by my actions though.  I was kinda just being a dick but I wouldnt have become irrelevant so quickly if he had been less greedy about our expansion toward Turkey.,boardgames,d6395iu,7,t5_2qmjp

8496516,0,t3_4w2hmq,I own Blood Bowl Team Manager Cosmic Encounter Eldritch Horror and Libertalia.Out of those Libertalia gets the most plays because it can play up to  out of the box has little to no downtime and very easy to setup. At lower player counts its strategic because you only have several people to predict at higher player counts it becomes chaotic. Chaotic but still fun and still has some sort of strategy. You each have  cards representing pirates with different abilitiesrank and you select one each round to raid a ship. The catch is that other players are sending pirates as well so they have to settle with their rank and abilities who gets the best treasure. It has that rock paper scissors feel to it only youre playing with a lot more people. Cosmic Encounter is a more recent purchase and one I bought because of replayability high player count low downtime asymmetric powers and simplicity of setup and teaching. From the looks of your collection your group may be fun to play this with. The meat and potatoes of the game are the  alien powers negotiation and betrayal. I introduced it to my friends as an Intergalactic Game of Thrones which is apt because FFG just announced that theyre gonna release a retheme of the game using the HBO GoT franchise. Blood Bowl Team Manager is a sleeper hit. I really like this game because of the theme the deckbuilding aspect the different playstyles of the teams and the luck factor which is essential because there is a skill gap between some players in our group. Ive seen people call it the game that Smash up wants to be and I kind of agree. It does most good things smash up does but without those clumsy stacks of spells disagreements going over one another when a base is about to blow up and just a general slowing down of the game when scoring.Eldritch Horror is the one thats hardest to get into play. Me and my group love it when we play but the setup time and the long play time limits it to when were really in the right mood. The advantage of this game is that you can play it solo and it really shines when it comes to telling a story.Some other games Id recommend  Wiz War with the glokoose bgg variant Deep Sea Adventure and Bohnanza. I introduced Wiz War to my friends as that scene in Harry Potter where theyre doing battle on a hedge maze only that you are all assholes wanting to really off each other and you all have horcruxes hidden on treasure chests. All I have to say about Bohnanza is that its a very simple game that never gets old. Deep Sea adventure is a much simpler and smaller escape from atlantis and Im probably underselling it.Im happy to say that all these games are fun and you cannot go wrong with any of them.,boardgames,d63m6d3,2,t5_2qmjp

Eldritch also has the added advantage of being good with a group as well whereas I only really like Mage Knight as a solo game. For meeting people Meetup is probably the best option. Chances are there are already board game groups somewhere near you. Ive been to a few in my area and have always had a good time.

8585376,0,t1_d6eb61e,A couple caveats though. First is that the rule book win condition and how to win can be importantly different. This is especially true since there are some players who consume rule books and spit out strategic heuristics i.e. the player in the group who reads the rule book to learn how to play  and people who find that all frustratingly vague i.e. everyone else. Players usually need the the top level goal in the context of what do I doSo in Agricola the rule book win condition is as I recall have the most points at the end of the game. The what do I do to win heuristic is more gather and spend resources on efficient feed your family and then become wealthy.There are also exceptions where discovering how to win is easierthe whole game.

Its not going to work unless the two of you both know the rules backwards and forwards. Otherwise the new player is going to be making mistakes on his turn that youre not catching since youre not present.

8604553,0,t3_4xnvyo,This is bound to be situational. In many games where Ive just taught a newbie or two Ill give them tips here and there. Ill take a break from strategizing my own moves and Ill focus on their position. Ill give them a few viable options and in doing so they kinda get multiple brains working on a single puzzle. Meanwhile other experienced players might be more inclined to aggress against other experienced players. In  Wonders this could result in the new player cashing in on people paying the newbie for resource access over paying a more threatening opponent. It could also mean that a newbie gets away with a monopoly on military or science or the blue scoring cards simply because theyre focusing on something and no ones taken them seriously enough to take actions against that. Couple that with the advice they receive here and there and then maybe some dumb luck or prior game experience and youve got a newbie win. Take away the helpful table take away experienced players going easy on the newbies take away the dumb luck and the prior experience and expect scores in the late teens. ,boardgames,d6h5wa7,1,t5_2qmjp

8613566,0,t1_d6i7ju5,Well every board game we play could be done with an app. I like the way the app is used to obscure information instead of another player having to do it all. I have had first edition sitting on the shelf two years unplayed it was a gift because I didnt want to have to bother with all the minutiae. Moving that to the app has been really nice. Sure it could all just be a pretty weak video game but that takes away from the shared experience at the table. That being said I do agree that its overpriced. An MSRP of  with a regular online price of  would be MUCH more in line with what I think you should pay. FFG is really into this  huge box   game thing.

8616376,0,t1_d6ikjdb,Reasons I rate it very highly Specifically designed as a solo game though this edition also supports coop and vs. play. Highly variable play.  The rules offer varying difficulty levels each one including more mechanisms characters and events.  For each difficulty level multiple game lengths short standard epic etc. are also supported. For me the game is highly thematic and tells a great story every play. Very high quality artwork and production.Reasons Ive heard some people dont enjoy it Complex ruleset sometimes called fiddly at the higher difficulty levels.  I feel the rulebooks there are many do a very good job of making the rules approachable. Set up and tear down can be time consuming.  This can be streamlined with a good storage solution  I use a DVG counter tray.

Its extremely slow to learn to play as its hard enough to learn your own character but learning what everyone else does and how to counteract it is a very slow process  I ended my first play with only the vaguest notion of what many of the other players were doing.Also the downtime here was as awful as any game Ive ever played. Everyones trying to figure out what theyre doing and figure out what everyone else is doing. None of the characters played smoothly  they all had a million fiddly rules.And the art  its just not very good in my opinion.

8689743,0,t3_4z0a3a,gtEven if its spending  credits or whatever the term is. Getting locked out of the bridge or having no good options for your deck is a big complaint of mine back from the Marvel Legendary days.Theres a variant that I play with for regular Marvel Legendary where all the available hero decks are separate instead of shuffled into a single deck.We draw a card for each deck face up and thats our pool of available recruits.  When a hero gets recruited or KOd the next one is drawn from its deck.  Alternatively a player can spend  recruit power to draw a single card from any of the hero decks in order to cycle through them and find one they want andor one they can afford.  When the deck reaches the end its shuffled and starts fresh.This change mitigates some of the primary issues I have with Legendary which you mentioned in your post.  I hate having only  or  heros available for me to recruit simply because of poor shuffling and unlucky draws.  It gives players more control over which heroes they can construct their deck with while still limiting them to only a single card of each hero.  It also allows players to cycle through the heroes faster and spend recruit points that may otherwise be wasted.So far its been a hit with my group.  The beginning of the game is no longer a trudge through being poor and buying agents because thats all you can afford.  You can start building your ideal deck right away and if at least two players are going for the same hero you quickly have to change your strategy if you wanted to go for that one since each hero only has  cards.It can make the game a bit easier depending on which heroes you have but that allows for some of the more difficult scenariovillain combos to be more feasible.Edit Also thank you for the Firefly rundown I am still interested in it even after reading some of the complaints.  Artwork doesnt bother me all that much and the episodes and ship mechanism sounds fun.,boardgames,d6rugid,3,t5_2qmjp

8722728,0,t3_4zg25k,gt Should you let new players win?No absolutely not but I do have an instance that Ive done that. So I was teaching this new guy Dale of Merchants. He was really enjoying it and I was playing like I usually do. The problem is that midway we found out that he misunderstood a rule and that was a hindrance to him. He was a very good sport about it and we kept playing but I was in an unfair advantage. So come the end of the game I could pull off a combo and win the game but I decided instead I would just use the cards to buy and try to win with a different animal. That would give him a couple of turns just so he could catch up better. To my surprise on the couple of turns it took me to recreate my win condition he was able to pull off some really impressive combos himself and won. Honestly I think that even if I have won he wouldnt have a problem but I feel that leveling the playing field was a good way to avoid him being frustrated with the game specially because I know Im not the best explaining rules.gt What would you do?Its all about the game selection I think. If youre trying to get people to play more games with less hidden information and clearer win paths are the best. I probably wouldnt start with Tigris amp Euphratis for example.Also when teaching a game to people be it gamers or not I try to make my game plan as clear as possible even if that means that they can foil me easier. For example if the game was Lords of Waterdeep I would get a quest like Ok of all these quests these ones have the better benefit but maybe they are not the type that would benefit my lord so I need to consider that. Taking in consideration the requirements the bonus and the type Im choosing this one. I also try to keep track as much as possible in what theyre doing so I can give some tips Remember that a couple of turns past you did this now if you do that or the other you can maximize the benefits. Teaching a game is more than teaching the rules for me its teaching how to play well. If the players understand that they will have a pleasant experience win or lose. Even if you pull a combo or win with a strategy they didnt think of it they would still see the thought process and how can they apply that in future games.gt What would you say to your friend?It should NEVER be about winning. The end result win or lose is the result of the experience you shared and hopefully part of it. The best things about board games is that they are an experience you can share with other people. If people are not having fun then winning is pretty pointless.,boardgames,d6vzd0u,1,t5_2qmjp

They posted a picture of the game and they didnt even bother to rotate the picture so the box isnt sideways. And they just wrote thanks for the game. But before I sent them the game I sent them a long message about why Im sending them that game and based on their likes and dislikes why I think they will like it and to let me know what they think about it. But nothing they waited about  weeks after it delivered to post the whole time I was worried if the gift made it. Really disappointing.

8873572,0,t3_51rg3d,. Terra Mystica   There are a few things that I can really say about this one but Ill address what I find to be the biggest problems with getting this game played for me.  a. It doesnt play well with . The player count should be .   b. It can take too long to play through. Largely because the games interaction is better with more players but more players make it a longer game.  c. Its a mouthful to teach even though in application it is oddly elegant to play.. Bora Bora  a. The game generates your decision tree for you as you play. While you do have actions and choices that really matter everything is so damn tight that if you dont follow through with every strategy and decision you make youll probably lose.   b. While I think its one of the best elements in the game Stefan Feld made a game where nobody is ever happy with their dice rolls.  c. The dice arent the biggest element of randomness that can screw you. Its the ManWoman helper tiles that pop up at the beginning of the round. They are a key element to fulfilling your strategy and getting progress out of your turns. But you never know which ones will be popping up and in which order. . Galaxy Trucker  This one I actually have a more difficult time to criticize the game because I think this game executes its intended design perfectly.  So I would be just reiterating the common criticisms other people have with it which have never been a problem Ive personally had. It also is a game I would tend to think I wouldnt enjoy as much because of how random the game is but I laugh and smile so much when I play it. More so than most other games. But it isnt my  game so there has to be something holding it back right?  a. It doesnt have the same level of depth I generally enjoy in games. Its not a very deep game at all but it has a complexity and rules exceptionsvariances that would mostly be found in heavier games.   b. While the base game doesnt come with  players the expansions do add a th player and the game really lacks intuitive th player rules. Everything seems forced to work with a  player game. . Dungeon Lords  a. This game is so damn hard to play well. Theres a huge number of decisions that can be made and so few turns to make them. And its a game you can AP until hell freezes over.  b. The game is maybe a bit too complex. I was talking about the exceptionsvariances in Galaxy Trucker. Dungeon Lords has it beat by a mile. Just about every aspect of the game does something different. No two priests are a like. No two monsters are alike. No similar action locations are alike. Now dont get me wrong  I find that to be a major appeal. But at the same time you need to carefully examine every component every decision and every part of the boards just so you can understand what the implications are of your decisions.  c. The fewer players there are the more complex the game gets. This is a  player game. Plain and simple. The  and  player variants are passable variants but they add even more layers of depth and complexity in a game that is already running at what Id consider the ceiling of passable complexity for its type.. Mage Knight  a. The fewer the players the better. Ive only played this as one and two players. I dont know what reasonable offer exists that would talk me into playing it with  or more. The time it takes to play is a major investment. This isnt just a game It is an event.  b. The iconography does a very poor job of translating information. Mage Knight similar to Dungeon Lords and Galaxy Trucker has a lot of specific rules about specific things. And the iconography doesnt actually communicate those rules to you. They basically provide a reference symbol that you have to pull up reference sheets which cause you to pull out the rulebook itself.  When really clever and careful iconography can relay a lot of that information intuitively.   c. The pacing of the game can feel very slow. As involved enjoyable and fulfilling I may find each turn to be you have to solve a fairly complex puzzle each turn just to move. The order of operations to solve that puzzle is critical to your success so it feels like youre shuffling around variables and doing simple algebra just to do the most mundane of tasks. ,boardgames,d7eh88n,0,t5_2qmjp

8877513,0,t3_51t3ti,Take the advice to hit up the subs for game design. Youll learn a lot!Outside of that Put together a prototype and play ASAP. Dont get stuck in this world of crafting a theoretical game and revising rules forever. Once you have the basic idea together prototype it  that might mean hastily drawn index cards and bits borrowed off from other games.  Avoid exceptions in your rule set. If you find yourself working on rules and are constantly saying something works in one way Except when ... you have a rules problem.  Playtest. And do this with as many people as possible. Have friends play. Have strangers play. Play with people. Put the game in front of people and have them play it figuring out rules as they go. Do a print and play.  Kill your idols. You might get infatuated with a mechanic. But if it doesnt work for your game you probably need to drop it. Dont try to design around wanting to retain the action drafting mechanic that you lovingly created if that mechanic doesnt work.  Edit. As ulargefather noted a good game has nothing left to remove. Cut the fat. If on a play test you realize that you cut too much then add it back. ,boardgames,d7eya7e,1,t5_2qmjp

8916169,0,t3_52e922,A few people have suggested Agricola and Caverna. Both are great suggestions since they scale perfectly when you add or subtract players. Id also throw Trajan and Castles of Burgundy into the mix. Trajan is more complicated but I personally love the theme while Burgundy is less complicated though it still requires strategy and planning. I see the latter as the next step for people who like Settlers of Catan want something more complicated and strategic but not by too much. If youd like suggestions with a bit more action I like XCom and Space Alert but they can be a bit stressful since they use a timer feature but at least it keeps them from running too long.For a fun coop experience WITHOUT time pressure I highly recommend Robinson Crusoe. Its a great game because its hard and requires everyone to work together. If people do their own thing the group will ultimately fail. It CAN suffer from a backseat quarterback telling everyone what to do if theres one player who gets how the game works but if you all learn and play together that effect should be minimized. ,boardgames,d7jlcrf,1,t5_2qmjp

You could play solo with any number of characters p with  characters or p with  characters all of these would be enjoyable. That said playing with  characters has a tendency to make Pandemic easier and in Legacy this effect is amplified slightly though I wont say why. In our game p  characters we won  games and lost  games ultimately winning  of the  months. I think if we had powergamed by avoiding certain weaker roles we could probably have won all  months without otherwise being any better at the game. A perfect record seems very hard though because once you have won two more games than youve lost you have no events.,boardgames,d7juiu8,1,t5_2qmjp

Hansa Teutonica is best at the max  players or  players on the  player map included in the base game. Again because there is an area control element to the game jostling for position on routes it benefits from more players.For me I really enjoy both games but Hansa Teutonica hits the table more because of the faster play time even at full player count. However Mexica looks amazing on the table and the components in the Iello edition are top notch. If player count doesnt really matter ...

Honestly though part of it is probably that I never particularly cared for any of Races expansions. And base game to base game theres just so much more variety in Roll though I do like Rolls first expansion quite a bit  so thats another point in its favor.

8961928,0,t3_5311db,Doomrock is great. It is very hard though and equally frustrating. You are right though it can play a little long. Most of that time tends to be due to combat setup and resolution though so with experience the time is greatly reduced. Most importantly its fun. Seriously fun. If you know anyhting about the type of humour in the game and its for you Id definitely consider it.Shadowrun is a different type of game. Definitely more card driven than Doomrock. For a deckbuilder though I actually preferred the Legendary Encounter games. I just couldnt invest in the Shadowrun mashup theme of scifi meets magic. Drawback of Legendary Encounters though is that you will need to get expansions for it luckily they keep bringing them out.Since you mentioned Doomrock which was a Kickstarter game Im wondering if you ever looked at Aeons End? Having not actually played it Im not going to recommend it but it looked interesting.For coops have you checked out Ghoststories? In terms of gameplay its a bit different and hard.

Plus with the survivors in KDM they are meant to be modular so there are lots of different ways you can put them together. Some people have even gone so far as to magnetize everything so they can build whatever they want using various heads bodies legs arms weapons etc. It can be kind of tough though and it would be nice if they had better or even some instructions on how to assemble them though.It would also make shipping more difficult because some of these models can get quite large.,boardgames,d7r3lpg,2,t5_2qmjp

8981937,0,t3_532zds,This is maybe not the biggest flip out but I literally just experienced this a few minutes ago...A friend suggested an impromptu game night tonight with our usual group. A few people couldnt make it including the two people with the best games so the selection was scarce. I decided to just go buy a new game Munchkins...There  of us which is too many but it quickly went down to  when one player became immediately disinterested because the game took too much thinking and bailed. So were trying to figure the game out. Which was frustrating with everyone talking and not paying attention. But eventually it got going and was going pretty smooth. We realized half way through the cards werent shuffled properly but said fuck it who cares. Towards the end I was in the lead GUY  was in second and GUY  in rd. GUY  goes to battle and level up and I screw him over cause I can and hes close to winning. He starts to complain about the game me and how everythings unfair. Next round comes and I thwart him again hes boiling at this point. GUY  almost wins but doesnt draw the right card... So I win. GUY freaks the fuck out saying that this game makes no sense it was fucked from the beginning blah blah blah. He starts verbally attacking me for his loss because I used all my card on the guy in rd and  This game makes everyone mad except one person Making a huge scene and walking away without helping clean up. It was horrible. A yr old grown man becoming that upset about a simple game is bad enough but we barely knew what the fuck we were doing for the first hour of play... Who the fuck cares who wins right now? He basically ruined the evening for everyone cause he couldnt handle coming in rd. ,boardgames,d7rhp7l,1,t5_2qmjp

To help keep up with this Ive been posting in the What did you play this week thread each week here.  I dont think there is any official challenge except what we have created for ourselves.  Im happy if others find inspiration in this because games are fun and playing them all should be fun as well.  Ive been tagging each of my posts with Play All The Games or just PATG for short.

Came in nd out of  because I made a mistake at the end thought I could build a building on a hex that already had someone elses buildings on it...wouldve been a  star move if I had chosen a different hex to attack gt hold for my producebuild phase.  I played the Polania sp? faction and really went to town on the encounters by building a mine early taking move alot and using my quick factory card to jump between movingupgrading trading for oil and upgradingenlisting and then moving my character twice.  Ended up snagging  encounter cards during play which really helped boost my resources.  Next time I play Polonia I will try a similar encounterheavy strategy with the lake movement mech or riverwalk mech which seem more efficient than the mine in retrospect.Mind you Ive only played once.

9031806,0,t1_d7xge69,If youve played base game Pandemic then the rules are probably fine. Its totally plausible that with a smart group and good fortune you can go  no problem. Heck even with slightly above average luck. Itll catch up to you eventually.For comparison My group plays Ghost Stories on the highest difficulty and wins about  of the time. And even we lost  games.So I dont think it was made to be too easy just a coop game like this lends itself to fluctuations in experience. just for maybe slight help here are what I find to be the most common missed rules. You dont pick who goes first. After youve picked everything then first player is random. Many people will purposely let Medic or Quarantine go first to get ahead of the disaster which helps all game.. Flying in rioting cities although you are doing so well that probably doesnt apply to you. Later game though be careful to make sure you arent taking flights where you arent allowed to.. Relationships if you played the character in January they dont start with a relationship. That is new characters only who trigger relationships with someone who can still be with someone older.

If the start up is too slow use the strip mining option from one of the expansions I forget which since I have them all. Basically the first player picks a supply planet deck and flips over as many carda as there are players. Then that player takes one of those cards and each player in turn also takes one. Once those cards are gone  the next player selects a deck amd repeat the above steps until every player has picked one deck. This gives a head start in crew equipment and upgrades equal to the number of players in the game. Its a great speed up  though a little unbalancing.   We added an option where you start with k but have to pay for all upgrades gathered this way. ,boardgames,d809mjs,1,t5_2qmjp

I think the game loses something with just  players as we each just pursued our own three suits.Arkwright p Played the Spinning Jenny version for our first time. Overall Spinning Jenny is not heavy at all but I really enjoyed it. There are just a lot of clever little things about how it connects things. Looking forward to trying out Water Frame soon.Imperial Settlers p I played the Atlanteans my opponent the Japanese. I was able to get a good VP engine going early and won comfortably. I really enjoy this game but feel like it is a little long when you figure out how to optimize engines. I think Id like the st State rules that go to a certain point amount not a set number of rounds.Not sure I have any hidden gems. I think Carson City is underplayed but it is a highly regarded game. Favorite p game is probably Tides of Time. I dont get to play many long p games as Im normally the host and cant be monopolized by a long p game.

And therefore we are clearly intended to lose our first games and eventually theyll die off as part of the storyline and then well unlock specialists or something.

I get rid of games that arent fun to me and keep the ones that are even if theyll only get played once a year.For your acquisitions it helps to think realistically about your play group. Since I mostly play with my wife I try to only pick up games that are her preferred weight which happens to mostly match mine though Ill stray higher on occasion and that play well with  players. Quick setup and teardown is a plus since they lower the barriers to play.Avoid the new hotness. If you get caught up in that youll overspend and underplay. I agonize a fair bit over most of my purchases now that Ive gotten the acquisition bug mostly out of my system. I tend to acquire only if its been on my wishlist for a while and if its a fairly good deal. I regularly update my wishlist and prune the games that seemed like a good idea at the time but which likely wont be favorites. It might be fun to try that game but there are plenty of good games out there. You dont have to buy one to try it.

You can choose when you take more tickets or take trains or dig the deck or block people. There are so many more interesting decisions in that game for me. Just being able to decide how you want to get from place to place is a nice player choice. Splendor for me seems to play more or less on auto pilot much of the time. I want to get this reserve and do minor steps to achieve it. Great. Can i afford anything. Buy that. I realise that Im exaggerating there but the two dont compare for me.

My rules are all based oninspired by older ones that used this idea of Harmony and I really liked it and tried to make it work well. Its a big board with a lot of movement and your tiles will be spread throughout the board. Captures are more rare but you still need to pay attention to your territory or else you can be wiped out. There are ways to trap tiles from a distance and in general I wanted to make the large board feel small during play. Itll be more fun and complicated than checkers with a lot more possibilities. But less serious than chess. Its aiming for fun with enough competitive strategy possibilities that can be explored as you learn it.If youre interested Im excited to play anyone whos interested if youd like to try it!By the way if you want a more chesslike game inspired by Pai Sho check out Paiko.

Theyll do rookie mistakes like playing USSR theyll make early war in Japan only to have that reversed with the USAJapan Alliance card.Its not the case with Dominion. Every card that might enter your deck is there in front of you face up.

9167940,0,t3_55vmou,Hah! Their new three week thing is very much a reason why it happened to me as the target. My Santa was AWOL. Completely AWOL. It was nearly February and I finally got a message from my original Santa. I had to chat with Octavian about what would be the best procedure for me to go because when my Santa got back to me I was just assigned a replacement Santa. The original Santa eventually delivered and I told my replacement Santa who then went on to help out someone else instead. My original Santa was really nice about it. We talked a bit on email afterwards and he seemed like a really good guy.I know I had this discussion last year and I was eventually talked into it. But overall I havent had super great experiences with it. I figured it would be very much one of those its as much fun for what you put into it as what you get out of it sort of thing. I was going to spoil the hell out of my target. I had a whole bunch of taunts prepared and written. I was going to include a whole bunch of additional things. I ended up getting a target with only a handful of wishlist items and he didnt add any more despite me pleading for him to give me more to work with. He didnt communicate back at all. I was so Jaded I just bought him one game on his Wishlist and a few other ones that seemed to touch on his preferences. I was going to send him locally roasted coffee and a whole bunch of PortlandOregon only type things because I found some comments saying how much he LOVED Portland. But he was so laisseramusement I just didnt feel so compelled anymore. After sending him the gifts he did placed a comment in the What my Santa Bought Me thread. But it was very cut and dry. I want to have fun with it. And I read about everyones great santas or targets year after year and I just dont get anything that matches their experiences.

You can call your credit card company explain the issue and they will issue a charge back. Your CC company will refund you almost immediately and will investigate the issue on your behalf with the vendor. If they find that the issue was warranted then you get to keep the money. If they discuss with the vendor and find that you either lied or the issue wasnt charge backworthy youll have the refund amount removed.The issue gets a little dicey when we add the shipping factor to it. I cant speak to what your options are if the item was damaged in transit. Youll get into some debate around whether the item was damaged because it wasnt packed well or if it was damaged due to negligence on the shipping company. In this case Im not sure if you can process a chargeback.One thing to note about charge backs  they can leave a very black mark on a company. So in the effort of morality Id make sure to pick and choose your battles. Purchase a good that was falsely advertised and charge back is your only option? Go for it.

My guess is that reviewers by the nature have to deal with a larger number of games in a shorter amount of time.  So they dont have the time to really get into the intricacies of Race and a game like Roll is more appealing to them.  I think that Race is more rewarding in the long run but reviewers just dont spend enough time with it to see that.Plus Roll has the plastic toy factor with cups and dice where Race is strictly cardboard.

Ive played the starting scenario  times and it was the identical tile layout and plot points each time though most item locations are different. I dont know how the expansions will affect this in the future.Once you have the main plot points of a scenario figured out it becomes easier as you know which rooms to ignore and which to focus on to advance the story.For  I really would like more replayability than I got and I would like nicer quality plastic minis mainly a more rigid plastic that held its shape and details better. Keep in mind I am also a hobby miniature painter as well so I expect a bit more from them than most.Now for  BampN Sale I think this was money well spent.

I asked her why and she couldnt explain it but it had something to do with more interaction  which is true. You do have to think about what your opponent is doing more than you do in Concordia but if you prefer a tad lighter fare with some of the same decision points this game is for you.Its also the most beautiful game I own. The board is expansive and immersive the player boards are simple and well designed the components excellent the cards clear. I think Tzolkin is more tight game but Concordia offers more paths to victory and perhaps more replayability?

9301676,0,t3_57szbr,My wife and I went through the same games. Heres what we just cant stop playing after like six months...Rivals for CatanIts supposed to be the two player version of Catan but its really its own game. Completely different and it is awesome.We have both expansions and you have to try out all the eras but theres three eras that just kinda suck Era of Explorers It takes too much space and takes too long to play. Its also not very strategic and the winner is usually just the luckiest. Era of Sages Boooring! Easily the slowest of all the eras. Takes ages and while there are some interesting cards its mostly just useless junk. Era of Prosperity This one is OK I guess but not when you play The Princes variant which is all we pay these days because it keeps the game so damned interesting! The problem with this era in The Princes game is that if you decide to draw cards from Prosperity you basically have to draw from it exclusively. Otherwise youre wasting draws because all the cards in this set sort of rely on each other and cant stand alone.So basically get Rivals for Catan which is cheap! and the Age of Darkness expansion and skip the Age of Enlightenment expansion since it includes those three Eras I mentioned above.Seriously Rivals is awesome and is easily the most replayable P game Ive ever played.BTW My wife and I played  Wonders Duel a dozen or so times and found it to be incredibly repetitive and boring. Its basically the same gamestrategies every time with very little variation. Its basically a game of hoping your opponent screws up and if youre both equally skilled youll end up with luck being the deciding factor  of the time.,boardgames,d8v1zfb,1,t5_2qmjp

9310794,0,t1_d8vi6b4,At least one of the Straw Man examples is quite true already  it has been a trend in s to add actors of African descent into fantasy movies  and it was done often so bluntly that it looked weird. Which is sad because there is so much possible ways to bring full other continents in play especially considering real kingdoms and wars in Africa during early Middle Ages  but no they just had to repaint elves dwarfs and others while missing this opportunity of bringing new lore.As for historical part  I have done some reading in the past days on Ottoman Empire  and it seems unlikely that till late th early th century you will see that many women working in public places. Though of course there will be much more than  DAlso banging creators heads for kebab shop is just weird  ok they didnt have exactly those shops but there were food stalls that are not that much different  why to attack so vigorously?What I am concerned is the trend of pink glasses view on Middle Eastern countries. Ottomans were one of the most powerful and advanced countries for centuries they dont need somebody protecting them.Yes they had an amazing culture I lived and traveled in Central Asia for decades and saw enough of its traces but they also had slavery religious dogmatism and quite a few unpleasant sides to them  and while there is a trend of talking about ugliness of West its a great disservice to miss showing the whole picture of other countries.But all that aside  Im afraid to see consequences of this harassment from the community and reviewers  whitewashing blackwashing or other Nwashing of games without giving any thoughts to it is going to hide the symptoms but not solve the problem of mistreatment.I would love having a game for example about female traders in Europe  while visiting Amsterdam I learned about a Jewish female trader who after the death of her husband became very proactive figure and left extended correspondence and memoirs. That could be an interesting theme. But making a game about Middle Ages trading  where half of the characters are female  I dont know if it would have anything with the real state of affairs and would not allow to understand what have changed over the years and how much we as humans had to learn.,boardgames,d8w7mj1,-1,t5_2qmjp

I have several suggestions you could look into.These first games are my gotos for when I dont want to think and strategize a ton but still want to challenge myself and have some fun.Dingos Dreams  Its like bingo but with a shifting board and has lovely art. The best words I have to describe gameplay are calm and refreshing.Taiga  Another calm game this one relies on simple short term memory just enough of it to stretch the mind.Ingenious  Simple yet interesting pattern building and simple yet interesting addition.PickaDog or PickaPig  A pattern building game where you have to make a sequence of cards whose images are only one variable different from the previous one. This is normally played simultaneously which I dont think Id recommend for your situation but Ive enjoyed a house rule that makes it turn based with a timer that could make it a decent choice.Shut the Box  A game that sailors played in the s to pass the time. Its a dice rolling game with simple addition and probability. It can be good fun if you dont take it too seriously.Pass the Pigs  Mostly the same as Shut the Box but with a push your luck element. You roll rubber pigs and find yourself hooting and hollering for a Leaning Jowler.Sushi Go  Bit more complex than the others but not too much. Basic addition multiplication and memory mechanics.This game might be a stretchOnitama  This could be too cognitively taxing but if it wasnt I think it could be very rewarding to play. It stretches the mind with spatial orientation and patterns.,boardgames,d8z28xs,9,t5_2qmjp

9387709,0,t1_d95u3c7,gt I absolutely dont understand why people stick up for or shrug their shoulders at poorly run Kickstarter campaigns. I dont know the story behind this one but it shouldnt matter  Context should always matter. As much as people dont like to admit it Kickstarters are largely an amature process. But whomever runs the kickstarter should be obligated to provide what they promise. But sometimes there would be substantial sacrifices of quality to meet the anticipated delivery time.However I do agree that the company should be obligated to deliver to its backers before any additional profit is made from the game in my opinion. The game typically wouldnt ever get printed if it werent for the efforts of the backers. The only exception I can see is that if there are some sort of supplemental products that are included as backer rewards TShirts Canvas Bags Posters. Shipping is damn right expensive and it makes sense to bundle rewards together for a single shipment.,boardgames,d95yii5,7,t5_2qmjp
9387732,0,t3_59645q,Between Two Cities might fit the bill. Its about a  minute game regardless of players and plays  players. Its a competitive game with only one winner but there is a bit of coop in it. Everyone is building two cities one to their left and one to their right hence the name as you are in between them. You build those cities with your neighbors. So you and the person to your right are building together and same with the person to your left. Only your lowest scoring city is counted so you cant simply ignore one of your cities to make one great one. You actively discuss your plays with your two partners but you all play your tiles at the same time which is why player count barely affects play time. Someone also recommended Tsuro in here which Ill add on as well. Just played it for the first time and its a very quick to learn quick to play game that plays up to .

9406861,0,t3_59h6nj,Im not the most experienced miniatures  wargame gamer but this far Ive liked the XWing miniatures game the most. Its so easy to start playing and the playtime is reasonable. Unlike many other miniatures game you dont have to spend a lot of time on preparations but you still do have lots of customisation options and army building. Star Wars Armada was even better rule wise but the setup time killed it for me and I changed it to XWing. Also the starting cost for XWing is pretty low compared to many other games.Recently I got to try Guild Ball and really liked it. I guess I like the games where you dont have to build large armies  battalions and have less dice chucking and book keeping. In Guild Ball I liked that you can also win by making goals and not only by defeating the other team in combat.RuneWars The Miniatures Game looks interesting but I find the world of Terrinoth a bit boring  generic. Otherwise the game looks like a fresh take on Warhammer Fantasy Battle with less clunky gameplay. Im not too tempted to buy it though as I already have BattleLore nd edition which is more streamlined and works better for me. I really like the command and colors system it uses.It would be easier to recommend something if you can give more information.

9415275,0,t1_d98z1b4,gt The fear is that if you keep crying wolf whenever you find something that you could somehow conceivably construe as potentially slightly offensive to someone with a thinner skin than our atmosphere would allow to survive then people will stop taking you seriously when you point at games or whatever and call them offensive. The counterpoint is that while very little that actually gets published or at least widely accessible is actually deliberately offensive the fact is that over the years games have largely been produced with a white male audience in mind and pointing that out is a good way to make developers and consumers aware of that. Nobody is saying dont buy this because the theme is too whitemale they are just saying as they did with Istanbul there are  people in the artwork for this game and every one of them is male and that seems a bit ludicrous which the developers met with ?

There is still a very high demand for this game and for this deal to have gone through he would have had to agree to sell to a distributor for less than all the other distributors payed for it or possibly agreed to sell it for either way destroying relationships and causing everyone to demand that same deal.  He wasnt willing to sell his product at that price and so thats the end of that.  And Im not sure why you said maintain your exclusiveness.  He has permanent exclusiveness until someone else tries to sell a direct Scythe clone. This isnt a drug company or a grocery store where generics are possible. Just because the market would willingly pay a lower rate for a product does not mean the price is being artificially inflated when the seller does not want to sell at that price. The only way this would be artificial is by him creating a stronger demand by holding back copies of the game from anyone and making sure to keep stock below demand.  He said he isnt doing that and you have no way of proving that hes doing that so you cant make that claim. ,boardgames,d9a4ujk,5,t5_2qmjp

9465808,0,t3_5ac6ve,Arboretum  This card game is really really nice.  It has very simple rules and a surprising level of depth.  It is one part hand management and one part tile laying or in this case card laying.  On top of that the game is beautiful.  I have taught it to three people this month and all of theme really enjoyed it.  This is the sort of game that is really great to play on a weeknight when you want to have some mental stimulation but not spend hours diving into a board game. BGG RATING Babel  I bought this card game at a FLGS due to the fact that it is a player Uwe Rosenberg game.  The game is not enjoyable for me.  It has a lot of Take that! elements and a really interesting mechanic that determines when and where you can execute the special powers of the different card suits.  Overall though the game is won by the player who looses the slowest.  Does that make sense?  What I mean is that almost every turn is a setback and so the winning strategy is essentially to bleed out more slowly than your opponent.  The game was a trudge and will hopefully be traded away someday.  BGG RATING Yedo  This is a fantastic worker placement game with a fun although slightly pasted on theme.  Essentially you are ninjas collecting the items necessary to complete missions.  The game combines bidding worker placement action cards event cards and trading in a really tight package.  I was hoping to like the game and can gladly say that I walked away thinking it was great!  If you enjoy worker placement and would like some more variation in theme do yourself a favor and check this game out!  BGG RATING Morels  A really solid player hand management and set collection game.  The best mechanic in the game is how the market changes form round to round.  There is essentially a waste pile that can be collected as long as it has less than  cards in it.  So you can wait for the waste pile to fill up with cards you want and hope to snatch it up on your turn.  It is a fun pushyourluck element.  Overall the game is good but nothing special.

9495084,0,t3_5au3h8,Look into Super Fantasy Ugly Snouts AssaultThe art is goofy but it offers up a nice dungeon crawl experience a really satisfying dicebased engine where you choose how to divide up your rolls from  dice amp allocate your results to different actions some videogamey ability levelups and cooldown mechanisms and D terrain elements like wood barrels and pillars. Tom posted a good review awhile backThe components arent spectacular e.g. standees instead of minis tiny HP amp itemeffect counters but if the kids are going to play amp beat it up anyway...It really has the goods amp reminds me of older dungeon crawls of yore namely Heroquest. One drawback is that the later scenarios can run long and can feel pretty crushing if you lose. But all in all my kids have gotten a kick out of it. Another selling point as a parent its  on Amazon. Total steal. You dont have to worry about component damage as much as some of the pricier minisbased games and it totally delivers in the gameplay department. ,boardgames,d9jh009,1,t5_2qmjp

Whats the longest amount of time youre willing to spend reading a rulebook or explaining a particular games rules to your friends? Can you name any rules or mechanics or aspects you really really enjoy about the games youve got so far? Im definitely sensing an affinity for thematic coop games here... Seeing as everything you mentioned in the OP is a coop or semicoop game is your group turned off or averse to headtohead conflict competition and backstabbing? How important are fun i.e. broadly accessible actionpacked themes? Because a lot of the best games are about farming or trains or colonialism or the daytoday minutiae of running a chain restaurant.

9531215,0,t1_d9n6aqe,On the subject Ive recently been idly pondering like in a shower thoughts sort of way that most Euros are actually more chance based than Ameritrash games. The general idea is that if you roll a d  times the rolls are generally going to average out to .. Whereas if you roll that d once the result could be anywhere from  to  even  if playing by bullshit reincarnated pharaoh rules but I digress P. The important part being that more randomness tends to actually make things less random in certain cases. So while player skill is a factor regardless if two players are of equal skill then the entire game basically hinges on that one random element. Like look at the classic game of Nim essentially depending on the various factors with perfect play the winner is determined by who goes first so if this is randomized then that single random element literally determimes the game. Although I guess the same argument could be made about people of equal skill level in Ameritrash games but I dunno still havent thought too much about it .,boardgames,d9nx82o,3,t5_2qmjp

9594418,0,t1_d9umzfg,I do think its snobbish. First of all with a game like Feast for Odin the amount of plays is hardly informative. Im fairly confident for example I know the game as well as you do I just played it twice but I spend a fair amount of time just analyzing the board reading what all the occupations are etc. People have different ways to enjoy a game some like to just play it and see where they go others like to think and strategize about the game without actually playing it. But besides that even if you do know the game better. Why is my opinion less valuable? Thats a terrible mindset to have. Having played a heavy game like this  times is heavily confounded with liking the game a lot why would anyone spend  hours on a game they dont really like... Its not the type of game like say a codenames you randomly can do a lot in a boardgame group because others keep requesting it and you just play to please them. So if we limit critiques to better informed players we are getting a hopelessly onesided view of a game. Its important for anyone thinking about the game to see both sides of the coin imo and hear what people NOT like as well. And the comment about not experiencing two thirds of the content  is pretty silly. The occupations are a minor part of the game. In the same vein you can say that even the bridge worldchampion has only seen an infinitesimal fraction of the   possible bridge hands.. And yeah I certainly have a bias for Agricola but Caverna is fairly close and I dont know Ora and Labora. But thats just what it is my opinion. ,boardgames,d9vpibn,2,t5_2qmjp

Then as it turns out it is actually surprisingly simple unless you are trying to learn the specifics of every faction.  Pretty much all you need to know is the turn structure which is on a card every player has and what actions you can do in each.  Your faction card in front of you has any of the rules specific to you and really you dont need to care about anything else.  The positive of it being that even though it is so easy to learn and play it becomes all about strategy and the strategy part can get deep very quickly.,boardgames,da0816w,3,t5_2qmjp

9640725,0,t3_5d3dqa,The only xx I have played that had random setup was a  player variant of .  It had us remove two corporations and two privates somewhat randomly.  It really affected the gameplay greatly since cities that would have been good choices became much less profitable because of being blocked out.  I enjoyed it a lot and it makes me want to play again to see how differently it plays out.I think the gameplay itself is incredibly variable once the players start making choices so adding randomness to the game is probably unnecessary.  Each game seems to be drastically different from others due to butterfly effects of minor decisions early in the game.Once a game adds randomness it reduces depth since you cannot plan decisions many steps ahead because randomness adds variable noise.  Since the xx games provide a tremendous scope of possible decisions the difficulty of planning many steps ahead is due to the tremendous number of possibilities rather than the fog of randomness.What other games have variable setups or introduce randomness?,boardgames,da1f1ta,2,t5_2qmjp

Youre trying to help the world get cured though if you want to do the opposite theres a Pandemic game for that too...If you have another couple to play with T.IM.E. Stories is another good one to look into. You CAN do it with just two people but its not really recommended by most people.Beyond that a lot of games have campaigns that you can play through. Mice amp Mystics is one that seems to get good reviews. The DampD board games also seem to have campaign scenarios but theres not really much story to those. Dead of Winter is semicoop pure coop is basically mandatory at p and possible at any player count if you leave out the secret objective cards about surviving a zombie apocalypse and there are a bunch of main objective cards to play through with flavor storyvariance via the Crossroads and Crisis decks. Legends of Andor is another but its more of a puzzly type game and less RPGadventure as it looks.If you want to play games based on history there is Black Orchestra where you play members of the Nazi party who plot to assassinate Hitler or Freedom The Underground Railroad where you traffic slaves into Canada.Oh yeah a great coop not really storybased though is Beyond Baker Street. Its like Hanabi but is said to play much better with  players and goes up to  players and it has some theme to it. I love it as a p game! And that also makes me remember... Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective! It doesnt get much more storydriven than what is essentially a map newspapers and books!

These were sent th of May th of July th of October three emails on th of OctoberI also found in our system your email sent to us on st of October with information that everything is OK with the order.As far as I checked today in our system your history of interaction with our customer service was very good.

I am happy to see that Chevee  our U.S. rep  immediatelly jump in to help you and I am happy you two are in touch. SIDE NOTE. Tracking activity of the company on Social Media and getting conclusions about the status of the company based on Social Media posts might be not the best idea. As our fans saw on Social Media for the past  weeks Portal Games was moving to the new offices. We were moving whole warehouse offices everything. Our webstore and our wholesale distribution was closed for two weeks and information about it was posted in the webstore. The whole company was stopped for three weeks. We were packing stuff moving stuff and unpacking stuff. Basically company was moving products and not working.It didnt stopped our marketing. It actually made it even more active. We were excited about this big event. We were posting videos on Snapchat and pictures on Twitter very intense. It was exactly what our fans expected  be part of this super important moment in the history of the company. We were active on Social because we love our fans and we interact with them. Being close to fans and talk with them on FB or Twitter has nothing to do with the fact that for three weeks the company was basically closed and in moving process. ,boardgames,dacdbs2,16,t5_2qmjp

I highly doubt your prof is looking for an actually fun to play  real world board game its just a more casual way to display some concepts. For instance you wont lose points for the game being lame.

9759688,0,t3_5ewifv,Ive played both quite a lot and enjoy both of them immensely. Its really hard to recommend one over another.Do you value miniatures and visual immersion over the persistent campaign? If you do go with Mansions of Madness. I personally prefer the campaign play in Arkham Horror TCG and the permanent effects youll get during the scenarios. It really feels more personal and youll become more attached to your investigator. MoM has no character development whatsoever.The replay value is pretty much the same in both games maybe leaning a bit more towards the AHTCH since it has clearer differences between the charactersclasses and playing the campaign again with another character may feel very different. Mansions of Madness has a decent replay value too with different outcomes and some randomisation although I would love to see more of it. It is however harder to control how much of the new stuff youll be able to see on the following playthroughs.Playing time is one of the biggest differences. AH generally plays faster than MoM. MoM has a few shorter scenarios but it also has a couple of really long ones so if you prefer shorter sessions AH is better for you.Lastly can you commit to play through the campaign with you SO? With Mansions of Madness you can change the player count without issues every time you play the game but if you start AH with two youll be more or less stuck with that amount of players through the game. You can play solo after youve started with two but you basically cant go back to two after playing alone.I would also like to point out that you really dont need two core sets for Arkham Horror unless youre a minmaxer. You have plenty of options with one core set and youll be getting more with the expansions so I do not recommend buying two core sets before youve played through the first campaign and decided yourself whether youll need more options or not. I personally like the uniqueness the single core box causes since you cant have multiple copies of each card in your deck and especially with both investigators in play. For me its more thematic that way.Also you dont need a TV setup for MoM. We have to option to connect on TV but usually we use a tablet and either rotate it from player to another or only one person handles the app. I feel its really weird if everyone just keeps staring at the screen silently while reading the texts instead of focusing on the actual game and someone reading the text aloud.,boardgames,dag3lqb,1,t5_2qmjp

Ultimately the game ends at  rounds and knowing that takes the pressure off everyone in a big way.

Actually now that Ive finally played Arkwright it seems much more approachable than the rules made it seem Im pretty sure I could teach it in  minutes.We also played Bamboleo at Thanksgiving with a lot of nongamers.  Boy do little kids love a game where things come crashing down.  We played loteria too our hosts were Mexican which isnt much of a game unless youre a little kid or you dont know Spanish which is to say it was quite a game for most of us.A bunch of twoplayer games of Arboretum and Kaliko a game I dragged out because I just found a copy selling on ebay for  and thought damn I have that.  Kaliko is just as good and just as bad as I remembered  theres a lot of luck of the draw a lot of hopeless searching for opportunities and a good player will skunk a bad one.  Arboretum seems to favor the player who draws all the s though I suspect that the fact that I was a head four games to zero at the end indicates that failing to play defensively is not a very good idea.And of course A Feast For Odin though theres an asterisk next to my victory because I misinterpreted an occupation card its not collect  silver if you have a longboat its you may sell a longboat for  silver.I dont spend a lot of time with my immediate family the ones who are still alive are on the other side of the country from me and we seem to like it that way.  But Ive certainly played a lot of games with them over the decades  I played History of the World with my mom and aunt for instance and Acquire was a staple in our family.The longest game Ive ever played at a single sitting was probably either Civilization or   both took more than  hours.

9791018,0,t3_5farx1,Sad I got to this thread so late. I have two big ones that havent already been said by others so much I never Kickstart. I see its potential and I think its right for some projects but for the most part I see it as the stupidest gamble a consumer could ever make. They pretend to be an investor in exchange for a product that didnt have a good enough concept to secure traditional funding. Granted sometimes boardgames are tough to sell to a traditional publisher. But theres a reason for that. This space can be BRUTAL and truly great games are truly rare. This space is brutal precisely because......... If boardgames are movies and television the FLGS is Blockbuster. This ship has sailed. We as consumers are incredibly lucky to have a wide variety to pick from but that same variety has made shops irrelevant. When I board game shop I click through Amazon. I read reviews find playthroughs and research. If I can afford a  board game I sure as hell can afford to play it some place nicer than the dingy little game shop with a body odor problem. Board game cafes seem to be catching on but they have the additional difficulty of competing as restaurants always difficult. Amazon isnt just endangering the FLGS. Electronics shops even Best Buy are having trouble as a result of this business model. Its extremely consumer friendly. Give me what I want at a cheaper price and youll put it on my doorstep in two days time? Hell yeah. Added bonus No smelly people.

Every Chinese company Ive dealt with will agree with you on almost any delivery you ask even if they know it is absolutely impossible. And they hate giving you bad news so they put it off until the last possible moment when you are usually completly screwed but had they told you when they first knew you could have done damage control.

Whether playing casually or competitively working to get the majority of those out just isnt feasible or worth the effort if the character doesnt provide a win condition e.g.  cost Dormammu Dark Lord of Chaos While Dormammu is active your opponent pays  more to purchase action dice.. This makes a majority of those largely unplayable. The same goes for many of the OP prize cards. ,boardgames,dans1v2,2,t5_2qmjp

So these huge truckloads of games show up at a warehouse and need to be sorted then resorted so they can be ready to ship. Plus there are logistics and shipping rates to settle and its all being done out of a single warehouse in Minnesota. Dont get me wrong Im irritated too because they arent responsive and any hype about getting these games is long gone. But because theyre so unresponsive Id recommend not cancelling.

9863613,0,t3_5gkpsh,Okay I deleted my previous overly detailed post because it was too long!  Anyway the end of it is probably all I need.All GMT COIN games is that any can be your first one if you are willing to put in the reading and tinkering time.  These arent games like Splendor  you dont show up at game night read over the rules as a group then set up and get playing.  Sure the rules of a COIN game are about as long as Twilight Struggle but you need time to understand the way the game plays its simple but it may take a while for it to sink in and how a faction plays as each is different and consists of a victory condition  commands and  special actions... and you not only need to know your options but also your opponents options and how these all interact.However all COIN games also come with a playbook that will most likely include things like a multiplayer gameplay example and AI tutorial section designer notes card overview and a faction strategy guide.  Your best bet is to head over to GMTs COIN game listing click on a game that interest you and download the playbook.  Read over the example of play to see if it sounds like the right game for you.  If not try another one.  All of the previously printed COIN games will have the rulebook and playbook linked in the description of the game.Okay now Im going to get lengthy again and give a quick overview of my impressions.Andean Abyss  Dont own it yet so I cant really comment.  First COIN game full sized map and it covers a conflict Im interested in.Cuba Libre  Second game in the series.  Half sized map the game fits on the x board except maybe the couple piles of tokens and the deck of cards but all the pieces are on the board and the track is on the board also half the pieces and the most standard style of gameplay with minimal complexity.  This is probably the best first COIN game if you want to learn without heavy studying or want to teach it to others.  There is also an expansion in the works.A Distant Plain  Third in the series and my least played.  Covers the Afghan conflict multiple scenario lengths are actually just accelerated games.  You discard cards bring into play any permanent effect listed on them and have more pieces out on the board that simulates playing to the first or second scoring card.Fire in the Lake  Fourth in the series and my first COIN game.  This one is probably the most complex and the  factions in it are probably the most conflicting... the NVA can infiltrate the VC the ARVN faction wants to reward key people with patronage and the US populace wants the troops back home while the US.  Hardest to learn each score card marks the end of a year and changes the ARVN faction capabilities they are coup cards and represent a change in the government and there are  decks covering different years so you can construct a chronological series of historical events.Liberty or Death  Fifth in the series and one I didnt think I would like.  I got it because the Patriots were the insurgents rather than the heroes of the story.  Event deck like Fire in the Lake  factions with very different piece mixes shared goals between  factions make it a great  player game or cooperative  player game and interesting dice based battles plus leaders that are much more complex than the other games but not that bad all make this my favorite game.  I find this has the best mix of rules you might see in other games and even at  I would buy this again if my copy were lost.Falling Sky  Sixth in the series.  Combat is very different in this game with irregular pieces being vulnerable to attack when hidden and defenders have an opportunity to retreat before battle.  The game is also focused around gaining allies of the tribe or keeping them subdued and only the Roman Legions are the regular forces.   of the player factions have a leader piece that can be the named leader or their successor and there is a th nonplayer faction that triggers during scoring winter and can be manipulated by one of the player factions.  While a half sized board like Cuba Libre the player piece regions are separate cardstock player aids and thus it is more of a  sized board with a full compliment of pieces to manage.  Many say this is a great first game like Cuba Libre but it is much more involved and piece behavior is radically different.If you want the easiest to learn and one that will help you play the most COIN games later on Id go with Cuba Libre.  As I said my favorite is Liberty or Death as I find it has the best mix of elements youll find in all the titles in the series.  Falling Sky is my second favorite but it is the most atypical one in the series.  if you are willing to put in the time Id say get the one that interests you the most after looking over the playbook.,boardgames,dat929b,3,t5_2qmjp

9897704,0,t3_5h42ne,Since youre already involved in Chess Id strongly recommend picking up copies of Shogi. It shows how an idea variant can result in a drastically different game once it is analysed mechanically and strategically but should also be familiar enough that it isnt bogged down with unfamiliar mechanics and terminology for middle schoolers. It also allows for an interesting culture point at least from my point of view of how a pure matchmaking rating Elo system for Chess players while Shogi players go by a tierbased Dan ranking. The only thing that could potentially hold this back is that it uses characters on the pieces instead of iconography or English on almost all Shogi sets so finding a suitable one could be more difficult. That said its truly a brilliant game and I hope you at least consider it.Besides that there are two strong categories of games Id recommend since your collection covers a lot of the core bases. First Id suggest getting any kind of social deduction game. Your collection has a lot of strict strategy and playing the numbers but lacks this sort of analytics in my mind. Mafia Werewolf or Secret Hitler Thatd probably get you a few letters from parents I think are the better examples but if you can always go for ones with less complex variants such as Avalon if you think it is better suited for the students. Trying to read into the opponents moves in terms of what role they are and what role they want to present leads to interesting strategic methodology that can have very good debate and engagement with students.But more than anything Id  recommend any gambling game even though I know how gambling is frowned on in school. I was a high school Math teacher and trying to get approval to teach a unit on combinatorics focused around gambling was rough even though it was extremely popular with the students and probably the most reallife useful unit and taught the most most critical thinking outside of proof haha. This is obviously most easy with various casino games but I think that a traditional Pokerstyle game where players individually raise the pot is too complex of a topic to get into for a class that is trying to have a breadth of games. Instead games that have a buy in and a payout I believe are better directions. Even Blackjack a game that is optimally played by following a simple chart is a good look at statistical analysis to generate that chart but instead Im actually recommending such as Mahjong Chinese Mahjong not Japanese or Riichi Mahjong due to the increased complexity of rules associated with it although I think its the better game overall due to the nonbetting gambling way they play out. A game like Mahjong is also much easier to get through the school bureaucracy and PTA haha. Mahjong allows for all the traditional kinds of analysis found in Poker or Texas Holdem or other western card games but in a more structured form due to the buyin point system and set round limit. It also allows a player to read other players in much more intricate ways due to the visible discards as well as how a player might shift their strategy due to the end of the game coming up and some other strategies and mechanics not present in a western card game. But it still is extremely analogous to these card games so it shouldnt be difficult to introduce and will provide the same sort of feel and analysis.,boardgames,daxp06q,4,t5_2qmjp

Also Im fairly new to table top games and I felt that the game creator who said this game was easy to learn and teach was lying lol. Seemed pretty complex to me. Maybe the retailer that cant sell the game doesnt even play it themselves. My first job as a kid was selling video games and I found it was always so easy to sell the games I was into.

9964133,0,t3_5i898j,I sleeve more for practical reasons and whether or not markings or some weartear is going to affect the game play at all. I dont own any games where I think the value is so high that I want to sleeve them just to retain the value.Like in Cosmic Encounter I dont sleeve anything. The alien cards are barely handled and there are just so many encounterflairetc cards that micro damages here in there isnt going to ruin the game play. Unless you have a friend like Phil Ivey and can recognize and memorize small marks and deficiences on the cards to gain advantage. But for him there are like hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line so...However I definitely sleeve like Avalon and Secret Hitler where you are constantly handling and using the same cards every single game. Any deficiencies in these cards are easier to remember and will ruin gameplay.  I learned to sleeve these games after my copy of ONUW became unplayable because of all the color that has worn out on the back. And I think we only played it like  to  times. DEFINITELY sleeve this game. The art is printed right onto card without any plastic reinforcement or anything. This means the ink falls of quite easily.,boardgames,db6cpcl,5,t5_2qmjp

9967134,0,t1_db6nykx,Ive had the same issue with my group and vsMany games but I can honestly say after  plays that this is hands down my favorite of the genre. Theres a fantastic push and pull of both sides and theyre equally fun to play. The Invader has a bunch of cool tactical options and can play as hard as heshe can and not have to worry about ruining the fun for the others. As the Invader Ive had multiple turns where I step up with a big monster play a few cards and oneshot a marine. Ive even killed the same marine  times in one game but it doesnt matter because theres almost no downside to dying. They just respawn on their next activation and get a full turn. Also this might be the first game Ive played where the hero players feel truly badass and powerful. Even as the Invader with a massive army I need to play carefully or theyll wipe out a half dozen monsters in one activation. Anyway its a really well tuned fast paced experience. As I said I normally steer away from vsMany but this one does basically everything right.,boardgames,db6qsbv,6,t5_2qmjp

9979004,0,t1_db8adkt,Im referring to the pace of the action. How fluid gameplay feels and how quick it alternates back and forth. You dont get bogged down in the details because combat is quick and frantic. Movement is very dynamic and often is fed by your weapon combos i.e. the chainsaw lets you sprint around. So the systems and resolution feel extremely streamlined and fast when you engage with them.The fact that the game is longish most of my plays were right around  hours with one being around  minutes doesnt mean the systems that make it up arent fast paced if that makes sense.Imperial Assault isnt a slog or anything but this feels more energetic to me. The dice based resolution is faster and the way a hand of cards can feed into a turn with huge momentum increases the pace of play. ,boardgames,db8ajhw,6,t5_2qmjp

9995059,0,t1_dbacpuf,So maybe Im being a bit disingenuous when I say I dont understand the complaint. I do understand the complaint but largely disagree with it. I say I dont understand because I want people to articulate their issues with Blood Rage so I dont leap to conclusions and possibly argue against a straw man. Maybe people have a novel criticism of it that Ive never considered.But typically its look at that underboob so sexist!And that strikes me as completely misunderstanding what constitutes sexualization.That said I have heard some good arguments in this thread. The leader sculpt is a bit more problematic than the others. Taken by itself its not a terrible example of a questionable depiction of women. The underrepresentation of women in the game is a good example of how the game as a whole fails in its depiction of women.Finally Im ambivalent on this one but the notion that its problematic that the only female clan is in the art style of the scantily clad male clans isnt something Im completely insensitive toward. I do think it would have been better overall to have an additional female clan with a clothing style more like the Raven Clan since that would give us more diverse depictions of women but I dont think the absence of such a clan makes the Serpent Clan especially problematic.gtThat there are worse examples is never a good reason not to mention something.If we had a long list sure but we should always try to put our best foot forward when making our case. Theres plenty of room to dispute the Blood Rage example and we havent touched Cyclades but I think the complaint there is even more thin but there remain literally dozens of examples that are completely indefensible.,boardgames,dbadug0,1,t5_2qmjp

To me Agricola is just much more streamlined and focused than Caverna. Caverna is pretty sprawling and between the farming caving dwarf equipping and adventuring it feels like  or maybe . separate games shoved together and less focused overall with too many options from the start. It is certainly less punishingly difficult than Agricola though.Between the two Id go Agricola.

10064006,0,t1_dbj92ey,Id argue what made Pandemic Legacy a great game is the foundation of the game Pandemic and the many mechanics worked out in On the Brink and In the Lab plus a few new twists.  Thus those fans of the original game and its expansions see more hype in the Legacy version because it has less novelty for them.I think it is a shame that the legacy game is ranked so much higher than original game  but some of that is due to the structure of BGG entries.  With Pandemic Legacy you have a single rating for a single game and thus it outranks Pandemic base game only which I agree with... but does it outrank Pandemic  On the Brink or Pandemic  On the Brink  In the Lab or Pandemic  State of Emergency or Pandemic  State of Emergency  On the Brink or Pandemic  State of Emergency  On the Brink  In the Lab?  With so many different possible game combinations you have to asks how this influences ratings.  Excluding promos numerically we haveTitle|User Ratings|Average Rating|St Dev|Geek Rating|Rank|||||Pandemic Legacy||.|.|.|Pandemic On the Brink||.|.|.|NAPandemic||.|.|.|PandemicIn the Lab||.|.|.|NAPandemicState of Emergency||.|.|.|NAObviously .x as many people rated the base game about the same the first expansion about x as many people rated the second expansion and less than x as many people rated the third expansion... but was there any difference in the underlying way they rated the expansions?  How many of the ish reported owners of Pandemic Legacy are also one of the  Pandemic owners and how did they rate that game?  How many are of the almost  owners of On the Brink?  How many are of the ish owners of In the Lab?  How many from the ish owners of State of Emergency?  How do the ratings for these groups correspond and how do the ratings of the nonowners of the legacy version rate?  Unfortunately it seems a lot of data is tangled together and would take some time to sort out.This is a long way to say I think where you come from influences the perception of hype over the game.  Im sorry you feel people were discrediting your opinion and will no longer share it with the public at large  Id be curious to read what you found so phenomenally great about the game and what your overall Pandemic experience and board game experience in general was.  It might have helped me revise my views.  Sorry for rambling... hope you come back and share your experiences with the game.,boardgames,dbjd3r2,3,t5_2qmjp

You can check them out assembled and unassembled hereFor the full k... I dont know random guess would be about ? Theres  expansions out currently each one with  new models. Plus random gear kits and so on. Then theres going to be at least another  expansions to accompany this kickstarter although only a bit more than half of that has been announced. Then theres a whole bunch of pinup display models and the gamblers chest as well. So that estimate might be a tad low.On one hand the miniatures are simply gorgeous much much higher quality than anything else Ive seen that was meant more gameplay.

Theres also A LOT less conflict in this version. No Spies no Attacks it went straight to euromode where you can only block and even then its not a big block as you can use energy to go to the spot you wanted to go. There are a lot more ways to score which is what sets this game and the previous game apart. In the previous game you kind of just bought what could make the fastest bombs. Here theres a lot more decision making I feel like and there are more than just one way to score such as end game goals the UN track the buildings and pollution free areas. Everyone also starts asymetrically which is really nice which the original didnt have until an expansion came out.The only thing that I wonder if the original was better at would be the spy mechanic Im not sure if it was added here that it wouldnt make the game better or worst.,boardgames,dblz12i,1,t5_2qmjp

My only worry and I hope you can chip in on this isa Is the game too combat focused? You mentioned it has a lot of variety and depth but it seems like a lot of people are saying in the final quarter of the game it all boils down to one big slugfest of a war especially with  players throwing all subtlety and strategy out the window.b Player countIll be primarily playing at  players. I plan to get Rise of the Ancients for the stronger aliens but is it still a good game at such a low player count?c Luck. You say the game is incredibly strategic but there seems to be a fair bit of dice rolling and praying for the right techs to pop up also the VP tiles for combat.

Its light on theme but high on fun and easy to learn.For mystery definitely check out Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective although be warned that you can only play each case once as will be the case with many storydriven games especially mystery games. There are ten cases though and its well worth the money. More cases are coming out this year as a standalone product. Theres also Mythos Tales which comes with  or  cases and plays very similarly but set in the H.P. Lovecraft universe.Mystery of the Abbey is like Clue but I think I prefer Clue to be honest. Still its a good option if you dont like the rollandmove of Clue or just want more mystery games.Watson amp Holmes is a little like Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective put into a competitive game with cards instead of books. Ive not yet played it but its high on my priority list.T.I.M.E. Stories is another one that I would recommend. My gaming group loves it and the only thing I dont love about it is the price. You buy the base game which gives you one story to play through. So you play it  times or so and then youre done you have to buy more modules to continue playing. I bought all the available modules and will likely continue to do so but it adds up quickly.If you can get a big group of people to play like  people Id recommend you pick up some social deduction games like Deception Murder in Hong Kong where one player is the killer and everyone is trying to figure out who based on some cards and some clues and The Resistance where some people are spies trying to sabotage missions.,boardgames,dbwxqil,1,t5_2qmjp

Provides a TON of gameplay for a not huge investment that can be purchased slowly.  Bookdepository has most of the older xwing content at roughly  off.

10200869,0,t3_5lzkz4,I think you are trying to accomplish two almost opposing sides here. You are trying to get an area control game for your collection that YOU want as well as a game that your SO would like to play with you. Of the two objectives its smarter to get a game that your SO likes because she is who you play with  of the time.An area control game is a very confrontational game that usually takes a long time to play and often has lots of things to memorize and get familiar with. Im not sure about your fiances gaming history but if she isnt wellversed with games it may be better to play a gateway game with her that has nonconfrontational theme say a Euro so that she has fun. Of course its entirely possible that shes a hardcore area control fan as well.The first thing to do is to gauge what level of gaming she is at. Has she played commonly suggested games here like Splendor Castles of Burgundy or Patchwork?Ask her opinion about Risk. If she hates Risk theres a high probability that she wont like ANY area control games. The thing with this genre is that its all about outsmarting your opponent which can be very frustrating. Your plans will often be foiled and you may be ganged up upon. Its not like a Euro game where you can usually do what you set out to do.So the first thing is to gauge where she is at because it is entirely possible that she may not want to play games in this genre.If she is rather new to this I think Memoir  is an excellent pick. Its really easy to learn it plays fast and the best part is that it scales very well for players of different skill levels. What I mean by this is that you can play as the Germans in a scenario where its clearly unfavored such as Liberation of France and then have her slowly figure out how she can play to win. The theme may not appeal to her but it is perfect for getting new players into the genre. Later you can play on more even battles such as Sword Beach.You could get a beefier game but dont expect her to play it if she really has not played area control games. You need to gauge where she is and buy the appropriate game otherwise youll get a game that just sits in the corner. After all you did mention that  of your gaming is you and your SO so what she wants to play is extremely important here.The other games you list are great games but again that doesnt matter if the person you play  of the time with doesnt want to play them. I would put those thoughts aside for another time and instead focus on what your partner will actually play for now. THEN when she likes the genre consider those dream games. I think Memoir  is excellent from a gameplay standpoint because its very easy to learn plays fast and most importantly that the scenarios scale to allow experienced players to play as a disadvantaged force. This is important because itll allow her to figure out how to win keep her morale up and so she can move onto more balanced scenarios. Just try and talk her into the theme if thats an issue because it is an excellent introduction game to the genre.,boardgames,dc0bq99,2,t5_2qmjp

You now know  of the rules to small world Low luck factor  Im a fan of low luck.  The only randomness in the base game being the reinforcement die and the next factions in the queue.  But from what I gather diplomacy is the biggest factor.  As long as you can convince people you have control.Replay  Such a variety in races and abilities gives you more bang for your buck.What I dont likeThe diplomacy  One person can ruin your day even if its a bad move for them.  Hurts more so in this because a youngster can wipe out your race for giggles instead of proper planning. player  Gets rid of all diplomacy and makes it a higher skill based game but feels like rules such as abandoning territory to relocate can be abused too much.Streaming or watching it  Its a mess unless you know every single faction.

Step  is the Alliance step. Step  is the Planning Step. The power tells you that you can use it after alliances are formed e.g. once all nonmain players who were invited to ally have decided to do so but before the Planning Step.At this juncture the power tells you that you can use it to give one card.  Not a card one at a time until you get what you want. Not multiple cards. You have one chance during this window to give a single card to either main player. If you gave one card then could use the power again and give another card you are giving more than one card. And if you changed main players you arent choosing either player youre choosing both.To give a silly and admittedly not perfect example if a parent tells a child they can have one cookie between lunch and dinner they couldnt claim they could have as many cookies as they want because each instance of taking a cookie is a singular act since theres no provision for limiting multiple acts of singlecookie taking. If the child takes  cookies they have taken more than one. period. ,boardgames,dc657c9,2,t5_2qmjp

10268500,0,t1_dc7m5fy,Youve played it once so it is unlikely that you read the almanac that comes with the game and explains the thematic ties of its elements which if it isnt your game who can really blame you.  For folks unfamiliar with norse history  the thingstead seemed weird to the reviewer  it was a real gathering place it also explains the Thing penalty Things were assemblies of people.  This happens with a lot of games where the designers idea of a linked theme doesnt mesh with public general knowledge  Trajan is another great example of this it seems pasted on but with what you do in the game is representative of Trajans reign.  Ive played it probably going on twenty times now and I do go to sleep thinking about different strategies for the game.  Saying that the game looks like its a bunch of different ways to accomplish the same strategy which is to get the most points actually you can do quite well without covering every board square is a cop out.  Thats the same objective for most competitive games and the fact that there is some spatial component to it doesnt make it unthematic or invalid.  Youve got to show your spoils to the public to let them know of your greatness if my home doesnt have adornments and loot Im probably a pretty shitty viking.The game has  spaces yes but they are grouped in easy to explain areas and many are variations of the same action with more workers.  Build houses build boats huntwhale get livestock get food get things from our livestock craft things into other things get building materials trade things for better goods use a trade ship to trade for better goods or masterpieces go looting go exploring send your ships abroad and draw or play cards.   total different areas with some overlap in the last column.  The number of spaces looks far more intimidating than it actually is and someone who isnt a very good teacher will likely make the game more messy than it is.  I do agree that there are some streamlining things that could have been done but if you know Rosenberg games they tend to have a lot of bits to them and a little fiddliness when they are on the heavier side.  The occupation cards are a bit of a letdown for me as well but I can understand hearkening to an older design but as the reviewer mentioned some of them are extremely situational while others are just generally good. This game gets its strength from the grand puzzle that is trying fill your board in a spacial sense while trying to optimize your actions to do so and to get the most points out of each action.  It might not be for everyone but its certainly for people who like sandboxygames.  Its not tight like Agricola Trajan an x game or the like but it does give you a lot to chew on and think about.   ,boardgames,dc7zoc4,19,t5_2qmjp

10290873,0,t3_5n9pkz,I highly recommend it. My group and I have been loving the game more than expected its been hitting the table constantly. The thing that really stuck is the dungeondelving aspect of the game. Its a close analog to other deckbuilders like Thunderstone that have two tracks do you focus on improving the economics of your deckshopping or adventuringconverting economic power to victory points and when? However its easier to set up and quicker to play than Thunderstone and the fact that theres actually a board to move around and race across is great. This gives a whole new layer on top of the deckbuilding.Continuing on the topic of the board the clank resource is great. It lets you choose between building decks that are efficient or fast with the risk that a fast deck might get penalized later in the game. Theres an associated gamepacing mechanism of the dragon attacking that gives a great sense of urgency to the game. If you dont make it out of the dungeon before then you get buried and score  points. This has been a very real danger in our group so watching the pacing of the game and trying to assess how much risk you can take on given how likely someone else is to end the game early is really interesting.,boardgames,dcaiyev,1,t5_2qmjp

There are the occupations buildings rivers floods pharaohs money and blights or whatever the tiles that destroy one of yours are called and they all do different thingsscore in different ways especially since some tiles persist between rounds and others dont.  In Medici there are the five types of goods that all behave identically and easily inform your strategy in later rounds and the golden eggs.For the actual auctions being locked into your three or four fixed bids is less innately intuitive when trying to value an auction whereas in Medici Ive found it more intuitive to just pay with points.

The puzzle board was warped out of the box.   The species mats are so ugly and out of sync with the rest of the art in the game. Also they add those wooden cubes which are probably adding to the price the cubes are just for counting didnt have to be wood.   This is a little bit of a nitpick but why add their logo to the silk bags? I was like cool bags! turns bag ewww.... Also the bags seem like an unnecessary luxury.

Cards can be much more or less powerful in different player amounts and I think the bans come from  player stats. In  player Agricola the family growth queue is extremely important. Cards like lover and wet nurse allow players to completely circumvent this and plow through the game while the other players trip over themselves trying to get their first growth.

Those strategies rely more on threatening to win via those means instead of actually winning. If you are trying to gain a military victory your opponent should pick up the occasional military cards. Not all not matching you . Just enough so you cant gain enough military cards.Same goes for science. Just stop your opponent from getting science if you see them going for it. If someone is going really hard on military or science you only need to not lose before the end of the game and you should win.However if you just dip your toes in and threaten your opponent enough to not pick the most optimal card from time to time you can leverage that militaryscience advantage to points. Its in its name DUEL. Moves you make have a direct impact on the other player. About cutting the game short your opponent can see you are taking multiple cards. Its not like you are having a secret hand and you have a sudden victory.,boardgames,dcib84o,2,t5_2qmjp

Also consider getting some board games on your mobile device. Ive had  different mobile phones and even the Windows Phone has Zombies!!!. The best bet is if you have Amazon Prime and either a Kindle device or an Android device not sure about Apple but probably not.Heres the deal with Amazon Prime and KindleAndroid devices if you have Amazon Prime you have access to something called Amazon Underground. AU gives you access to hundreds of free apps. And theres a lot of board games on Amazon Underground that are either included for free or are extremely discounted. If you have an Android device you can download the Amazon app sign into your Amazon Prime account and download any app you have on you PrimeAmazon Underground account from Androids Google Play store. Heres a list of games I have on my Android Device that migrated from my Amazon account Elder Signs Omens wexpansions all together maybe  Talisman pretty sure this is an AU freebie Pandemic w expansions all together maybe  Scotland Yard freebie Galaxy Trucker freebie Carcassonee freebie Catan freebie Labrynth freebie Splendor freebie San Juan freebie Ticket to Ride freebieThese are just the board games theres also a lot of turn based games that are very much like board games such as UniWar and Monument Valley. Heck theres even the entire Steve Jacksons Sorcery available from Amazon with at least  as free.

Not because its worse at other counts but i want the maximum amount of people to play against. Its a fantastic economy of design.

The game i played that is kinda similar would be Descent nd edition but with a little more complexity and more mature art and atmosphere.  Not that much imo way lighter than a game with DampD rules. Same mechanics as campaign modular board grid movement coop cool minis. I liked a lot when i played. If you and ur kids like Star Wars universe u definely gotta get Star Wars Imperial Assault. The rules and mechanics are pretty similar to Descent nd edition with improvements.  This one i didnt played but i will for sure when i can get the game. The other i played would be Arcadia Quest but this one is sort of PvPvE. Dunno if u want some PvP action with ur kids maybe u can tweek the game a bit to be coop only. But im pretty sure ur kids will love the art and minis. The heroes you control are all chibi style kinda animeish. Similar mechanics campaign  kill monsters and loot modular board coop ish awesome minis. Another one can be Masmorra same universe as Arcadia quest this one i didnt play.  This is a dungeon crawl game dice rolling for actions and monsters ur dungeon is made of diferent tiles. Theres a full coop variant. U explore kill monsters and loot. The components and art are pretry cool too. If u want to extend ur Mice amp mystics ride theres two expansions for it. Well these are the only games that came to mind atm. I wish it was of any help.

10452556,0,t1_dcsjjr8,Nope.  The turn order deck is an inspired piece of design.  Basically it works like this  There are always  player turn cards and two boss turn cards.  These are shuffled each round and played out to determine who goes next until all six are up then its reshuffled and it starts over.  The composition of those player cards changes depending on the number of players. players  Turn cards each. players   turn card each and  wild card that can go to any player. Players   turn card eachThis system means that every single player count feels as balanced and optimal as any other.  If anything players is likely the easiest setup.As to your other requirement in the main post Replayability is also incredibly high straight out of the box. Theres  unique player characters.  Theres a good number of cards to mix around and experiment with think Kingdoms in Dominion.  Theres  welldesigned bosses who in part share basic cards that can be similarly varied and most of which function differently depending on the boss because of a keyword called unleash.  The game also has Difficulty levels.  Theres the normal mode for each boss.  Then theres also an optional rule on each boss board you can play with that acts as a hard mode.  These additional rules arent just tacked on numbers increases but instead materially change how the encounters play out.  Theyre also freaking hard.  The Instruction booklet also suggests numbers for a beginners mode normal with the numbers eased up and some sort of masochism mode hard but with the numbers made worse for you.  You can easily change the numbers however you want as well so the difficulty is super variable.If you enjoy Dominion and want a player coop game I would seriously recommend this game.       ,boardgames,dcswcvg,1,t5_2qmjp

This isnt the issue. Many players are plenty competent in how to play. They just try to maximise to an absurd extent that hurts the game experience.In a game like Ora et Labora there is no randomness. Its a perfect information game. The best player will win. There are lots of options. But if you just take your turn instead of trying to figure out how to solve the game you can easily finish a  player game in  and a half hours. But with some people they could stretch it out to  hours. NO. Its unreasonable. Its why chess clocks were invented.Ive played a  hour game of Sid Meiers Civilization. Whenever it came to one persons turn me and another player would walk around the store and just chat. Because we knew it would be  minutes until he did something. He lost.AP can be absolutely destructive to the game experience. Just take your turn. Its okay to lose a game. Games can be fun even if you arent doing well or dont find the optimal path.,boardgames,dcy2a9r,1,t5_2qmjp

At any time you may need space for  large tiles a small board  jumbo cards and  regular cards. Take into account that each player has a mat and their own tableu of jumbo and two types of regular cards and you jave a big footprint. But I still recommend it if you like super heavy games. But there is a lot of text to read and lots of ways the game can play out which may lead to action paralysis. That being said the random setups and random victory conditions keep the game interestimg and tense. My little piece of advice is that the victory condition is both unintuitive and interesting so expect the games end to be a bit of a mess when you play with new players. ,boardgames,dd4dkwr,2,t5_2qmjp

TIME Stories is a good story game but remember it is a game you can beat module in  hours and have little reason to replay each module. It has very few real worthwhile game mechanics to where it barley feels like a board game. I think Tales Of The Arabian Nights might be a pretty good choice to look into. It has even less of a board game feel than TS but has what seems to be endless and fun storytelling ability. Its like one of those choose your own adventure books with light board gaming aspects. Im not sure if there is stuff inappropriate for your kids in this game but I didnt see anything like that in my play through.

10610632,0,t1_ddacaaf,Youre definitely going to tend to have a better time playing games with people who have compatible personalities and gaming preferences. Id also tend to agree that there are some qualities that are just generally good for gamers to have. For instance no matter how competitive you are its always a good thing if youre a good sport both in victory and defeat.If you have a full group of people who are considerate of others who have a good attitude who are of roughly equal skill and who enjoy similar sorts of games you have the makings of an excellent group where great experiences come with ease.I play with a lot of people though and I dont feel that anything that falls short of that ideal group reflects so poorly on the people Im playing with that Im going to blame them for creating bad experiences. I guess its just where you set your standards.There are some people however who are uncommonly difficult to play with and I dont relish the thought of trying to find the perfect game to play with them so that their personalities and attitudes wont ruin the experience.

Mysterium for instance has a plastic insert that is a great storage solution.  Everything fits nice and neat in its own place even keeping the individual voting chits separated by color.  Or Pathfinder ACG where each card type is kept seperate as well as spaces for built character decks even a place for add on expansion decks is included.As for tooling costs... Were not talking about plastic injection here where a ridiculously expensive mold has to be made.  Were talking about vacuum forming.  A mold can be made out of wood for vacuum forming.  Its relatively inexpensive to do.  I mean most of these games use minis or other pieces that ARE plastic injections that needed an injection mold...

10656707,0,t3_5sgrxu,Honestly and I say this as someone who plays FAR more video games than board games video games have never been a terribly great match for Kickstarter.  Board Games are a far better fit and a large part of this is because of what theyre asking forWhen a video game goes to kickstarter it is usually because the creators have an idea for a game they think would be awesome and have done some of the preliminary work and need Kickstarter to fund the rest of development.When a board game goes to Kickstarter it is usually because they have a finished game that has been prototyped playtested and polished and they need kickstarter to fund printing and distribution costs.Even though both of these deal with entertainment and have game in the name these are two wildly different problems.  Printing and distributing physical board games is pretty lowrisk.  You know what you need you know what the costs will be  it usually happens more or less as planned and you can normally plan around it with confidence.  Pretty much the exact opposite of actual development work.Which boils down to the one truth that backers actually care about  Board game Kickstarters tend to deliver pretty reliably.  Video games  not so much.Edit I accidentally a word.,boardgames,ddf5oku,306,t5_2qmjp
10656925,0,t1_ddeq14p,Ive heard the complaint but I disagree. There are a few specific things that are very thematic and the rest is reasonably well adapted.The blood echo mechanic is really good. Go to the Hunters Dream upgrade your character and save your progress or keep going taking the risk that youll lose everything but you get to progress faster.The weapons feel thematic. Bolt paper does damage contingent on melee weapons youve played in the game its a weapon buff. Blood vials heal you like in the real game. Guns give you first strike or allow you to attack safely but they do less damage. The threaded cane effectively always gives you a hit because its a quick weapon.The enemies feel thematic. I dont especially like playing Micolash as the boss but the fact that he keeps running away by putting more enemies in the deck is appropriate to his boss fight in the original game where he constantly runs away while an endless supply of enemies spawn in the halls as you chase him.Its not a perfect adaptation of course. The original game isnt semicooperative. If youre doing multiplayer PvE with another hunter its a perfectly friendly and mutually beneficial arrangement. However in the lore hunters are not always friendly with one another and you fight a number of NPC hunters as well as human invaders potentially as you play the game so it fits the lore if not the gameplay.Anyway Im a big fan of the video game and I really like the card game too.,boardgames,ddf6hrm,1,t5_2qmjp

Codex CardTime Strategy I think this is pretty much the best MTG style dudebasher game. The in game deck building element is really interesting and there are lots of hard decisions on each turn. Ashes Rise of the Phoenixborn typical LCG style MTG clone dud basher. Certainly not a bad game and the dice make it interesting but not a ton of variety.

The contract churning starts to feel very bland and plotting a path through the any two goods city andor ?! city was almost always the way to victory. Additionally I found it far too open in terms of the spaces you can use at P to be enjoyable.The game definitely has its merits and was good at P with a tighter board but personally I feel it has some issues. Im actually looking to buy Troyes soon myself to fill in the dice placement gap in my collection. ,boardgames,ddfsy55,2,t5_2qmjp

Its on my table and its staying there for awhile.  Even after getting GMT trays and planos it still is a beast on the table.  Let alone organizing the cards and characters.  I ended up taking one character brute and just sitting with it to look at the base cards to think about game play and the deck itself.

10751595,0,t3_5tttqx,Some will say Euro games are low interaction low luck factor and high on strategytactics. I generally dont agree on the gripes with interactions in Euro games because I think the best Euro games have very high player interaction. Games like El Grande Food Chain Magnate Caylus Dominant Species and Puerto Rico are some of my favourites that have a huge amount of player interaction. Euro games definitely favour lower luck in the games and some offer no luck elements past the initial setup. Some might also point to a lack of theme in some Euro titles but I always find the best Euros to fit their theme very well but YMMV.Ameritrash is also hard to define but its characterized by a focus on thematic aspects of he game and also a higher luck factor and often take that mechanics. In my collection Cosmic Encounter definitely falls into this category.Hybrid games exhibit features of both categories often Blood Rage is referred to as a hybrid.,boardgames,ddoy0oe,16,t5_2qmjp

A game state where a player determines that they can no longer win at which point they might as well play the social game called Who do I want to mess with. . The ability to determine who can win and the functional capability to do so player agency as you mentioned.If you can remove either condition from the game then you prevent the kingmaking problem. How to do so depends entirely on the type of game being designed so its hard to give a specific instance. With VP based games its usually easiest to solve through hidden VPs as you mentioned but it can be ANY hidden information so long as that information hidden piece positions cards in hand etc is something that causes uncertainty on the final outcome. As a counter example however let me present something like Love Letter  where kingmaking is actually part of the game design. Its expected that in each round players will try to take down the players that have most victories in hand and thats perfectly okay because youre limited in your ability to do so and each round is so fast that it doesnt really hurt to be knocked out of one.,boardgames,ddqp6dw,5,t5_2qmjp

Pathfinder is fun and light and spans over many sessions.Pros  Pretty easy to learn art is great and classes thematically work. Cons  some rules are a bit weird and have required me to go out and find clarifications when it is not your turn you arent super invested and basically say Do you need a blessing or help? sometimes getting a weapon or an attack in your hand means you have to discard a bunch which Im not a fan of wish they had starting items like Mistfall and not just a favored card type and I would consider the game too light in some mechanics. Neutral  The game spans over multiple sessions which is good for regular meeting gaming groups that dont want to play something different each week.. Mistfall  a more in depth adventure card game that can be played through in one session.Pros  Great threat system more intense with the threat system Im more engaged in what the other person is doing card management once understood is complex but the mechanics make it feel more like you are that hero such as the arrows with the ranger class and it can be nice to be able to still play an ACG that finishes up in a night so your group can play other games. Cons  The rulebook is horrible! The game is super complex and I would highly suggest play testing it before you have people over also make sure those people like heavy games. I invited another friend over the first time that I knew loved figuring out complex rules but we spent the entire first game passing the rulebook back and forth constantly. Neutral  Doesnt have campaign play. If you are looking for a game that carries over session to session then this wouldnt be for you. Conclusion Each game is really good and Im glad I have them in my collection. I really wish I could steal certain aspects of each game to make a hybrid game. Gloomhaven I have my eyes on but Im waiting on it. ,boardgames,dds4d3g,3,t5_2qmjp
10782472,0,t3_5u7dak,Havent played the other two but PACG is my sisters very favorite game and one of the games weve played the most. Though we have taken a few liberties with the rules and we make heavy use of anydice.comNote that PACG is not a dungeoncrawler.Theres plenty of variety in the cards that youll encounter. The stuff you run into good or bad doesnt feel repetitive.Its very interesting the way the difficulty changes with player counts. At low player counts its easy to finish everything in time but youve got less flexibility. With a lot of players getting through things quickly enough becomes a significant challenge but you can all work together on difficult challenges and they become much easier.A full adventure  scenarios so  games is  but you dont have to buy it all at oncejust get the base set  and get adventures as you get to them. There are four available get the one that seems most interesting to your group. You can also get the Character AddOn deck if you want to play with  or  players or if there are other classes you want to try. And then there are also singlecharacter decks for specific characters that arent supported.House rules were using You can sub in a new character if you want to without having to play through old scenarios with them. To build them up for each scenario roll d and give them one random boon of the corresponding type   weapon   spell   armor   item   ally   blessing that is in that scenarios set or earlier. Also give them any rewards given to each character mostly feats. We keep a guild bank of a handful of items that weve acquired and want to hold on to for later. Thats not really abused because anything not in the bank could be randomly found and be immediately useful. When preparing your deck between scenarios you can get rid of any cards you dont want. RAW youre only allowed to take boons from the box if you collectively dont have enough of the same type. This could mean your melee fighter is stuck with a bunch of bows or your arcane caster is stuck with a bunch of divine spells. Were just allowing ourselves to get rid of any cards we dont want and then taking new cards as the rules normally allow.,boardgames,dds4teg,1,t5_2qmjp

Reusing but slightly modifying mechanics like Undermountain for example land journeys which still will require facing a hazard and potentially require a food cost but do not require the additional cost associated with a boat or the creatures you can fight that pay out in fighters instead of money favor or shifting blame..

10795433,0,t3_5uduew,At this moment in time there are going to be no more sets coming out for Codex.  The way Sirlin makes his game is that first of all he playtests the hell out of them and gets people who would play the game to playtest the hell out of them. Not just the typical random groups of people who sign up were talking like hosting a digital version of game online and collecting data on mechanics and game balance that way. Then at some point the game goes to print. Then he keeps watching and maintaining and tweaking and later releases a second edition of the game or a third in the case of Puzzle Strike. He does however release EVERYTHING you need to play the game competitively all at once albeit in pieces. So yes I fully expect there to be a second edition released at some point. However given the complexity of the game and the time between each of his games releases and their second editions  year for Pandante which is basically Poker  for Yomi half of which was twice the characters  year then  years for Flash Duel  year then  year for Puzzle Strike which again was twice the characters Id say were at least eighteen months away from Codex nd edition which will be tweaked again and have whatever characters we are missing that havent been released so far. Do not view Sirlin games as a conventional games company he is to a certain degree antiMTG and produces games in a completely different manner to Wizards.    Also new editions of games do not make previous versions of games obsolete I believe in the Sirlin Game tournaments you end up with up to date product every time.,boardgames,ddth06q,2,t5_2qmjp

10824684,0,t1_ddwbf6j,gt Pathfinder DampD. Ignoring the  hour start up time it was  hours and we barely accomplished anything because we missed a flag. Battles were a slow slog checking the rulebook constantly. I hated the idea of having to be in character especially for that length of time. But mostly it just felt too directionless with too many rules for what just felt like make something up roll the dice and see if you can do it. I want a clearly defined system where Im given options to work withbreak that system. Thats part of what board games compelling to me the more I play the better I get at them.Yeah pretty much all DampD is going to have a bit of a learning curve but one of the major criticisms about Pathfinder and .x editions of DampD for that matteR from many folks to love DampD is that the rules get way too nitty gritty. There are charts and tables for everything and so many modifiers to keep track of. Its a lot of bookkeeping and some people love that. Others dont even if they love the storytelling and role playing aspects of the game.If you are definitely interested in the storytelling and role play but just felt bogged down by all the rules in Pathfinder then I recommend checking out th Edition DampD from Wizards of the Coast resources at rdnd and rdndnext. One of their major design decisions for this edition was to streamline a lot of the aspects that people felt bogged down play in Pathfinder and .x. The game spent  years in a public playtest mode where they really listened to community feedback about what was working in the game and the end result is a really solid system that is easy for new players to pick up while still being a lot of fun for veteran players source e is slowly converting my Pathfinder friends over because theyre having more fun. They are still working pretty actively to produce good material and revamp aspects that the community still isnt quite happy with too which is great.My recommendations for trying it out again Find a game store nearby that hosts DampD e Adventure League games they are modeled after Pathfinder Society games and stores that have one often have the other. They are generally open to whoever wants to drop in and the store has hopefully made an effort to have a solid welcoming DM at the table for those games. Its a good opportunity to try it out again without making a huge commitment. If thats not an option get a group of friends together to do it. If you have someone who knows how to run the game already let them. If you dont know anyone rlfg is another good resource for finding groups in your area. If you have a group of friends and none of you know what youre doing and someones gotta end up being the DM I recommend using the DampD e Starter Set. Its  and contains everything you need to play in the box including an adventure that can last you for  sessions or more as many people have noted. Its designed as an introduction for brand new players so the campaign guide essentially walks the DM through exactly how to run the game at the beginning with a lot of advice.,boardgames,ddwhnbo,2,t5_2qmjp

One idea Ive had is giving the player a choice of moving clockwise or counterclockwise on each turn. I havent tested this enough to know how it plays yet. The extra combat dice has been suggested elsewhere as well and I think thats definitely going to have to happen. Im thinking more now about incentives for risk taking giving players a reason to move further on a turn. The incentive so far is just to get more gladiators on the board. This doesnt really work in the first few rounds because you can bring in gladiators without running into any opponents but later as gladiators start fighting and dying you can bring in more by cycling which gives you a reason to move faster. ,boardgames,ddxu330,3,t5_2qmjp

Their range is bigger than any of the chain stores and the prices have been very slightly better in my experience. Their RPG book and tabletop miniature ranges are especially enormous by pathetic local standards anyway.Unfortunately with the horrible exchange rate right now buying online is only a bit cheaper.

10938992,0,t1_de7ld8c,The uninteresting point is one I really take issue with. Games of Scythe can be unlike anything Ive ever played before. The combat always present mostly undesired but sometimes necessary. Its that Cold War feel of constant tension towards the end game when a most players have their units spread over so many hexes and b it cleverly rewards and handsomely the number of controlled areas at the end of the game. Even at  players providing youre playing with someone who knows how end scoring works theres some almost unbearable tension as you dance around each other on the map and edge into one anothers safe zones calculating risk and reward as well as the potential battles that might take place as you go. A combat game is a combat game. An engine builder is an engine builder. I understand dismay from people who wanted one or the other. But if you can get over that and appreciate its incredible ability to blend those dynamics into this tense Cold War experience then it provides something that other games simply cant. Ill never feel the same level of tension with say Blood Rage because battle is so integral  I know its coming.

Im enjoying it so much that Ive played it quite a few times solo when there werent other people around. But Ive tried all player counts now and its even more fun with  players.Much like Dominion it has very simple mechanics so its easy to learn but the variety of scenarios you can construct from the combinatoric explosion of card combinations give it a ton of replayability. Its fairly rare that you get stuck with a completely unwinnable scenario and most of the games Ive played have been decided in the last few turns with the heroes straggling over the finish line bleeding and bruised or the boss just barely taking out the town youre defending before it gets slaughtered.

10958263,0,t3_5wgnzp,Im often fascinated by the lives of the taverns where DampD adventurers ask about rumors or Frodo meets Aragorn and Cavern Tavern is like Diner Dash in a fantasy tavern. It uses Kingsburgs dice placement mechanism but manages to integrate its theme much better than Kingsburg. One of its nicest touches of good theming is the Nasty cards random and often unreasonable demands from your curmudgeonly boss.Raptor gets credit for originality as I cant think of another game about conflict between scientists and cloned dinosaurs. The action point system is abstract but the actions themselves are pretty thematic. Momma Raptor eating a scientist never fails to satisfy.It seems like Gladiators should be a common theme but Spartacus Blood and Treachery is the only gladiator game with a BGG rank better than . Even if gladiators arent as unique as Thri Sahashri I think Spartacus does something special with its theming. You dont play as the gladiators themselves so much as the ludus owners and half of the game is about auctions and money management trying to buy better gladiators slaves and equipment to give your team the best chances in the arena.

I really dislike social deduction but Ive still played a lot of social deduction games in exactly that scenario because theyre easy fast and not much of a commitment.There is a sort of person who would hate Terra Mystica and find it overcomplicated but that sort of person rarely ends up stuck in a hour game of Terra Mystica. Who would make that kind of time commitment if theyre not expecting to enjoy the game?,boardgames,deaj767,3,t5_2qmjp

10970148,0,t1_debhedv,We came to the same conclusion about the hunter being mandatory our first game round was without a hunter and it was an absolute slaughter.Due to following the rules in picking characters we dont always end up with the best characters but luckily the last  games we played included the hunter. The occultist has proven useful but we have not yet used it to its full potential i guess. Probably because we had still been figuring out the game.Using portals is indeed something we forget most of the time but we seal up  gates pretty quick in all games weve played so far no longer allowing us to pass trough those gates. Or if we dont we end up with the old one preventing us from using them early in the game.And it does seem like weve had bad luck so far especially with shoggoths spawning directly on gates or  tile away making it hard preventing them from going trough and spawning yet another old one. Or drawing  evil stirs cards within  or  player turns. Which is why Im trying to find out if someone has experience with ways to manipulate luck a little in the game.,boardgames,debhrli,1,t5_2qmjp

If the new insert fits on top of the original then nothing need change. More likely if the new insert fits nicely on a side of the original I think either the cards or the bags of faction bits can easily be rearranged.If not then well probably look to ditch both inserts and get an alternative to hold the mechs and characters. Maybe a smallmedium Plano. That would not change the game box organization very much.Probably require different organization but one tuck box for each faction long and narrow with piece of foamcore in the bottom that slides out and has circular cutouts to hold  mechs   character would be pretty slick.Not sure if tuck boxes are sturdy enough.

When I saw dead panic on amazon below castle panic I figured the zombie theme would be better anyway and Halloween was in a few days so why not. When it arrived I had real trouble with the rule book and thought the game seemed needlessly complicated so I googled it. Thats how I found boardgame geek. Thats how I found the dice tower. Thats how I discovered rboardgames. And the overwhelming conclusion that actually this wasnt a great game. I still havent actually managed to play it and my family arent interested. So that sucks.

11062398,0,t1_delwah5,Personally I liked how CG felt less reliant on the queue randomness than Patchwork. Because of the options you have you dont necessarily get cornered into bad pieces early or arrive in a situation where your opponent gets better ones no matter the decision but in turn it felt more strategic in terms of the actual placement of the tiles as being inefficient really hurts you in the long run finish a garden too late and risk falling behind. I found that due to how tight Patchwork is the randomness affected me more and while CG suffers a similar problem its less so. It feels like you can salvage an unlucky situation more in CG than Patchwork.Not to say I dont like Patchwork of course but I would and usually play CG over it. ,boardgames,delwkxm,2,t5_2qmjp

11109084,0,t3_5yls7p,In order of my recommendationSherrif of Nottingham is mostly stick stuff in a bag and lie about the contents. Mechanic is easy and it feels like youre playing your friends expectations more than the game. That also leads to a lot of friendly banter afterwards which creates fun memories.Cash n Guns is a phenomenal gateway for nongamers and again is about playing your friends. Ive played this in a pub with  friends then followed it up with an  player game as random strangers went That looks amazing can we play?!Lanterns is really easy and intuitive and has a mechanic where everyone gets a payout each turn so keeps people paying attention even when its not their turn.Sushi Go is really easy simultaneous turns and the rules are written on the cards.Ticket to Ride is only three actions take cards play a route pick up tickets so is easy to start withTokaido is really easy to teach and play complexity really only comes as you add expansions and even those are easy for confident gamersTsuro is just one action but starts a bit slow.

11160976,0,t3_5zcqyc,The quick and straightforward is thisCore box is obviously the minimum needed to play. I would tell you to just start there.The expansion boxes Jabbas Realm Twin Shadows Bespin Gambit and Return to Hoth are the next most important thing. These add new tiles new campaign missions and several new units each. If youre only looking to play campaign this should be the extent of all you really need to expand your core gameplay.The Ally and Villain Packs are the individual units like Han Solo Bantha Rider etc. These are units that are all technically in the core game or in the expansions but are represented by tokens. The Ally and Villain packs are required if you want to participate in official Skirmish tournaments as you are required to have the official miniature to play. They will usually also have some skirmish cards some mini reward missions and a copy of the Campaign and Skirmish version of the unit you purchased. Again the only reason youd NEED these is if youre either doing official Skirmish tournaments or are a completionist. These are definitely the least important overall most of them are represented by tokens from the core or expansion boxes with a select few being completely standalone in their respective packs.To sum up if you want to get into the game just get the core box. After youre played that a few times look at the expansion boxes. After that if youre dead set on completing the collection or joining in some Skirmish Tournaments start looking at the additional units youd like to add to your listroster.,boardgames,dex3266,14,t5_2qmjp

Keep the upkeep to your self. Downside of the game is for a nongamer it could look intimidating just because of the table space it uses and the number of pile of cards setup.

11194848,0,t1_df0wlln,Quality Control is expensive especially for something with so many bits and pieces like boardgames. Thats why stuff like Ikea furniture always has extra screws so in case you get a few less than was supposed to be in the box youll still have enough to build your bookshelf.Someone at Asmodee ran the numbers and found that for the X games with missing components it was cheaper to send out replacements to the fraction of X buyers who requested them instead of upping QC to make sure those X went out properly. So I wouldnt really call it good customer service as if they really really cared enough theyd eat the cost of QC to make sure there were less problems in the first place but it is acceptable given that businesses gotta business.Disclaimer I am fully aware there is no way to  guarantee no defects but as youve experienced there is certainly room to improve ,boardgames,df0x83q,3,t5_2qmjp

11199102,0,t1_df14v4v,The game came out in  and as far as I can tell it only just recently went up in value thanks to a sudden spike in nostalgia I presume.   There was no ebay or internet back in  and when I checked ebay for it years ago it wasnt worth much.  So to get  for it I would have had to store it and be inconvenienced by it for about  years.  Its a really awkward game to store because the box is huge and you cant really place anything on top of it because the box and board will get crushed or warped.   With all that in mind I definitely do not regret selling it.  There are other games from that era that I actually enjoyed playing and still own if I need a little s nostalgia.  Also Im not even entirely sure I could have got a good price for it because the version I had was the Canadian version which has French and English text on the box and as far as I can tell that version doesnt sell as well as the Englishonly version.  ,boardgames,df1ektx,6,t5_2qmjp

It looks like theyve been taking on a lot of debt from private investors close friends and family.  It also looks like they are operating at a loss over the last few years.  But they seem to imply that these loses are in pursuit of expansion.  Lots of companies operate at a loss for many years while they expand.  Amazon ran at a loss for almost a decade I think.  And Tesla is still running at a loss.Still just because other companies operate at a loss while they are expanding and eventually grow into profits doesnt mean TMG will.Honestly what TMG needs is an evergreen title like Dominion Twilight Struggle or Catan.  If they find one your investment in TMG may be safe.  If they are constantly chasing one printing small batches of  units and scraping by with kickstarters Id worry about TMG in the long term.,boardgames,df24uy8,7,t5_2qmjp

11233570,0,t1_df56opf,On the surface its a multiplayer solitaire game thats got quite a neat system. When you start to realise that you can actually play against an opponent in an attempt to beat them it becomes a bit more interesting you can block them by reserving a card they were just preparing to take or you can deplete the reserve of a specific colour of gem. Its also very much a game of efficiency. The goal isnt to get the noble tiles or to build up a strong engine although both are ways of achieving the goal but to be the first to reach the required points total. Building up an engine with lots of level one cards is fun but its a really inefficient way of gaining points. The most efficient way isnt ever straight forward and requires a combination of reading both what is available on the table and what your opponent is doing.So yes you did miss something  Not your fault though as the game does look very shallow on the surface. The fact that people do play it at tournament level does say a lot about how much there is going on beneath the surface though.,boardgames,df5b603,4,t5_2qmjp

So I just let him do his thing while I fumed and drank enough to not care so much.Im right with you about the people who dont listen while you teach.

I personally dont want to see the way the hobby is headed be redirected to heavier games for accessibility reasons I mentioned and because there just doesnt seem to be as much interest. Focusing on what people like already leaves so much great stuff out and I would be worried that focusing on heavier games in mainstream games coverage would push even more good efforts that are more broadly appealing aside. So their lane being the heavy board games lane. ,boardgames,dfcxwcp,0,t5_2qmjp
11302518,0,t1_dfd2lca,crack knuckles Ill try. This is the only heavy game my wife loves to play she loves art. She can tolerate some of my other games such as Madeira only because I traveled with her to the actual island and show her off to my extended family there.What I like about Vital Lacerdas games are that he starts with a theme he likes researches it a lot for several months and then thinks up of mechanics to suit the theme. In all of his games he also incorporates a semicoop element even if it is very subtle. In The Gallerist it is raising fame of artists in Kanban it is manufacturing cars in the assembly line that can be claimed by anyone Vinhos it is the renown cubes raising the renown of a particular region that can be coowned in CO it is more apparent in saving the world from pollution.The Gallerist incorporates a lot of the art scene them in his games. Even raising fame or raising prices on subjective things is all based on the name and fame of the artist. Oh its ink blot made by THAT artist and it is being displayed in CackNBallzs gallery! Wow! It must be good! The buzz and hype raises the value of the artwork. With this in mind you can attract different visitors to your gallery. White meeples are Collectors and are wild cards with regards to raising money andor influence pink meeples are VIPs and used to raise influence and finally brown meeples are Investors and are used to raise money.I even had a funny moment with my family when my sister brought some visitors into her gallery and her boyfriend sarcastically chimed in saying and they stood staring at blank walls and called it art! I almost shot wine out of my nose! It stings. DThe International Market has been complained about being the least thematic. I disagree. I think thematically it can be explained as rubbing elbows with the VIPs and other important people in the world art scene. You have to have a visitor in your lobby and you have to either display or have sold a work of art of that type sculptures painting digital art or photography. The visitor leaving represent that person is now spreading word about what you had to say about that type of art increasing your influence and gaining a  favours an immediate favour for covering a bonus on your playerboard and a reputation tile giving you endgame bonus pointsYou can discover unknown artists blue and you gain a commission token at an extreme discount and can raise a good profit by raising their fame further and selling that art. There are established artists red that are more expensive to buy but unlock collectors. Thematically that collector is big fan of that artist and comes to town the central plaza to potentially buy that art but can be persuaded by any of the other Gallerist owners to go into their gallery so be careful! You increase the fame of an artist by buying their art or going to the Media Centre to wax poetic on that artists awesome work gaining tickets influence money or attracting another visitor to the plaza.The influence track and the kickout actions are other neat mechanics in this game. You can do extra actions if another player boots you out of a location. You can use an executive action to move visitors or use a contract bonus from a contract card. OR you can use your influence to perform a location action. This makes the game more strategic and tactical as you have to guess when your opponents will be visiting that location. You can even hire assistants so that they occupy locations for you potentially many locations occupied in a less than player game. You can even use your influence to give you discounts when you buy art. Oh its you! Ah you are so influential that I can drop the price a unit or two I doubt that art is actually sold in units depicted but in the thousands or millions gt    or   Buy and sell! Discover and increase fame! Bid at an international auction for a world renowned Masterpiece!Super awesome game components. Super thick cardboard linen finish on all the cards and the insert fits everything beautifully. If you are able to get the Kickstarter version it is even more blinged out.,boardgames,dfd4gpf,2,t5_2qmjp

11305026,0,t3_61b9o5,Terra Mystica isnt the best with two but its okay.Concordia and Keyflower are good with two and with more.BTW Im a little confused by your terms. Heavy to me implies a lot of time to think between your turns  almost the opposite of fastpaced.Heavy games are also often fiddly. The upkeep and mechanisms between turns often mean youre moving buts around or adding more resources to piles. I think of Agricola and Caverna as fiddly for example. But I suppose its a spectrum. But youre okay with Magenta Knight so...?I think popular  and stands the test of time is possible  a lot of the evergreen titles are still popular  years after their release. Terra Mystica Agricola and Caverna would all fit.Maybe I would add replayability as a term. I like the random setup for Dominion and Agricola  you have to adjust to the different setup and it brings more to the game. It feels like I can play the game more often.

What bothers me about SR and the reason I ended up trading it away is that it scales too quickly.

11381883,0,t1_dfm2zd3,What does the process look like for designing and making an insert?It always starts with playing the game a bunch of times and learning the rules.  During that were always asking ourselves what would make the game more enjoyable?  Is there a problem we can fix or something we can add?  Once we have a plan we start by drawing an initial prototype cutting it then testing it.  That process alone can take days or weeks until were happy.  Then we start the process of launching the product which by itself also takes weeks.  We have to design and print instructions packaging and labels.  Create website entries add it to wholesale lists convention lists create videos post social media work with publishers on licensing an approvals on and on.  We have a project template for launching an organizer and its looooong.  How do you decide which games will get a sweet lasercut insert? Do people specifically ask for them until you yell out charge ze laser! or do you look at the most popular games in your target demographic?  Pretty much yes.    We typically work directly on suggestions now as well as publisher partnerships.Where do you see Broken Token going? Are there other areas youre considering expanding into such as sleeves glass tokens like Jen Ham game bags like Game Haul or actual inhouse game production?We definitely want to continue focusing on board gaming accessories.  Sometimes we like to partner with people that are already doing cool stuff and other times we look for new product ideas that dont exist.  Were moving more into gaming coins through partnerships with people like Fantasy Coins and more into other accessories like the awesome Dice Throwers created by Draw Lab Entertainment.It looks like you already have D printed Terraforming Mars pieces  was there a particular reason for D printing these as opposed to less timeconsuming processes such as injection molding?This was a hard decision but it came down to tooling costs and whether or not we think we would sell enough to recover those startup fees.  Tooling is anywhere between  and  dollars depending on who I talked to.  If it were more of a generic product we may have gone that route.  But being something specific for really just one game we werent sure what its lifespan would be so we opted for the D printing route.

11396149,0,t3_62mnvs,Mage Knight is a great game but its weird. It follows a sort of inverse rule for  of players versus fun. Because turns can take so long the MORE people you add the clunkier things get. Unless you have a group of dedicated friends you like to play the competitive mode with who are very familiar with the game.This game I feel is best solo. But that being said two is the max Id go on if you want to play coop. Its not too bad in terms of downtime and you can both strategize together. Ive played it with my brother and its a good time.

Think about it.In a P game there are just as many infection steps before somebody has a chance to treat.With more roles there are potentially more infections before a specific roles like a medic turn comes around yes.

Maybe many of its mechanisms can be found in other games and maybe they are executed better individually in those games. But in my opinion there is no game that I have played that does what Scythe does nearly as well.Im not saying my opinion is more valid than yours or that youre necessarily wrong.

Thats the most difficult one of them all isnt it?COIN is not heavy because it is complex COIN is heavy because its written in GMT rulebook format that of a reference manual not a instructional guide and is LONG. If you teach scoring how the little turn chooser works then from there off the player aid cards people learn FITL in like  minutes. Then you can start with the playbook scenario if uncertain or a fresh game in any of the other setups. When people are confused about what to do you say What steps get you your  goals that get you scoring? repeatedly and if they cant figure that out point it out. GMT games should generally speaking not be learned from the rulebook until you know rulebooks from GMT. You learn rulebooks from GMT by learning multiple GMT games then go back and read the rulebook. Then and only then will it be understandable to most people. See section .. coups for further detail . I personally start with the playbooks still while probably in the dozens of GMT games owned and played myself.,boardgames,dfqcele,1,t5_2qmjp

11431892,0,t1_dfrpmdu,This sort of comes down to the idea that humans are basically random number generators in ourselves which also happens in chess. Like as in BattleCON the game has no random elements but if you consider humans to be random number generators it can be in a totallyunrelatedtogamemechanics way. Im not arguing with you here BattleCON is as nonrandom as it or any game can be.Lets look at the idea through the lens of chess. Zero randomness in the game  but I can start the game using the strategy A and my opponent picks B. If the players are totally abstracted randomly selected from a pool of players in an online chess program for example they can be totally random strategies for all intents and purposes  but it can affect the early game. Of course a good strategic game should ensure that these strategies arent too gamechanging early and players can adapt etc.  but the number of pawns I lose early game if its  or  or  might be randomly generated due to the human element.  Ultimately random kinda ends up being sort synonymous with outside of reasonable control and can have a lot of grounding in how much control players feel in a game due to understanding and decision complexity. A Chess game between two people who barely know the rules will be a lot more randomly driven than a game between pros for example where randomness will be almost entirely eliminated.,boardgames,dfrskan,0,t5_2qmjp

My hope is that I wont need a second copy of the base game in order to play with more than  people if I get the expansion.Roll for the Galaxy p x  Weve played lots of time but this time felt different. We actually played fast. We didnt sit around analysing each others dice selections. It finally got race feel to it and it made the game thoroughly enjoyable. Also it was the first time Id successfully used the productshipping strat instead of just building a ton of worlds which was nice to see as possible. Codenames p x  We had a good old fashion battle of the genders. Sadly the ladies won three of four. Thankfully... we won the last game or wed never hear the end of it. Much fun was had by all. Having played this three times in the last couple weeks does make me think we need to steer away from it a bit though before everyone gets tired of it. Game of Thrones Westeros Intrigue p x  Very cool little light game. The theme is pretty tacked on but I enjoyed the game for what it was... a really nice quick filler game. Pandemic p x  Had a new person so we figured wed play with only  epidemics. Never again. Its just too easy for experience players. You dont seem to end up with that chance of everything falling apart like in the  epidemics game.Legendary Marvel w Civil War p x  Love the game. Love the new split cards from the Civil War expansion. Iron Man thoroughly kicked our ass. Hercules let us down. Wish Id had enough time to play it again.Legendary Encounter Alien p x  Played the second movie with the recommended hero lineup with only  Drone card per person. Beat it pretty easily.  Drone cards in the past has been too tough but that involved a lot of shuffling around of the characters and scenarios. I think its time to go back to  Drone cards again or more likely... just play with more than .Question time! I dont actively improve my ability to play games. I will say that Ive always been good at them. Id chalk that up to being exposed to a ton of games from an early again of all types. I would imagine that my strong Magic the Gathering background has helped me the most. And I guess my general approach of always playing for the win never for the higher placement. Itll mean sometimes Ill be taking that  shot for first with a  chance for last... but Ill always play to my perceived outs. I would also recommend playing slower if you care about winningimproving. I will say though that for me these days Im actively making a point of playing faster and trusting my instincts because I dont really need to win all the time and I do like that more speed lets me get in more games.

Its harder to have two players playing different characters of the same class though. Each works have to keep track of their upgrades and inventory and keep rebuilding it when they take over. Additionally they wouldnt be able to play at the same time. Id just recommend they make characters of different classes unless you know for sure they will never play at the same time.Its perfectly fine to have multiple characters. Keep each of their stuff separate in their own boxes while not in use. there are only  attack modifier decks included in the game so youll need to rebuild it for each character when you switch but that isnt hardthe perks you select tell you what to add and remove.,boardgames,dfu2wby,4,t5_2qmjp

If you have two settlements connected as XX you can add a settlement by branching just one more road from the middle of that.  This affects a number of points in the analysis including thisgt This most expensive win can be achieved with the following components  gt Biggest Army Obtained by buying  development cards  gt  Cities Upgraded  settlements  gt  settlements With the associated road network  gt So the cost would be  resources card for the biggest army  for the upgraded cities and  for the settlements plus an additional  for the roads.This is wrong you can do this victory on less than  cost for roads.

But as to what youre asking Champions of Midgard takes the formula for Lords of Waterdeep and makes it into a dice chucker. Small World is all about directed conflict and murdering your friends but in the framework of a deterministic  area control game. Mage Knight is a very thematic game of exploration and competitive murder but runs on a bunch of heavy euro game mechanics. Robinson Crusoe is all about action efficiency risk assessment and resource management but youre throwing dice and pulling random yet incredibly thematic events from a deck. Millennium Blades has a lot to do with shifting economy calculated synergy and punching your friend in the face when they flip your cornerstone card and gain  fucking points in the process! ,boardgames,dfyj6p9,11,t5_2qmjp

11515763,0,t3_64c6fe,The fact that SotM is not a deckbuilder and cant really be compared to DC Deckbuilding or Marvel Legendary has already been beaten to death here.I will say that your enjoyment of SotM will be directly proportional to how easily you can deal with its fiddliness.I love it but the other posters here even those who have mentioned how fiddly it is havent really expressed the full scope of its capacity for fiddling.You have to track every players cards the villains cards etc. And there are numerical modifiers of  and  everywhere that could impact anything. There are tokens for most common modifiers but some of the unique cards dont have a corresponding token and the level of table awareness can get very high.So if thats not sounding exciting then its probably not for you.If it still sounds appealing and I havent totally scared you off and I hope I havent because it is actually a deep complex game contrary to what some posters here have indicated then I recommend that you check out the variants page on BGG for SotM.There are many custom heroes with custom decks. I particularly recommend the Cauldron expansions created by tosx.This is essentially a custom set of heroes villains and environments that would constitute  major expansions to the game had it been released by Greater Than Games. Its all freely available and able to be printed at any major printing facility that does cards.I highly recommend them as they are very well balanced. In my opinion I find them to be better balanced than many of the official heroes. Legacy has some silly interactions with some of them but if you have ever played the base game you should know that Legacy is essentially broken and has bad interactions with everyone.Despite the very good balance the Cauldron heroes are much more mechanically varied and deep than the base heroes. They are in many cases more interesting and fun to play with than the official heroes. They are fully able to be integrated with the official heroes.Essentially if you own all of the official SotM content Cauldron represents  to  more content at the cost of having it printed. I wont say its free simply because there is so much of it that printing and having it shipped can end up being fairly pricey. But it is well worth the investment.Good luck. Hope you end up playing something you enjoy.,boardgames,dg1bac3,3,t5_2qmjp

11546697,0,t1_dg3jn46,The ones with washes look really nice but I do think you recommending applying a wash is a point in favor of them being incomplete.Thats perfectly fine for miniatures painters that buy a game in part or wholly for the minis. But for a pure board gamer that wants to buy a game for the gameplay minis are significantly more expensive than traditional game pieces for something that is not in the state it is meant to be used in since minis are developed for a context in which they are going to be painted. Im not asking for fantastic works of art. As you said just single base coat or appropriate color plastic and wash bring out the detail and are more than enough for board game quality though games like xwing or MvM have shown that quite a bit more is possible with pretty good quality and without completely ruining cost. But for a pure board gamer this is a significant investment in time and money when they just wanted to play the game much more so than for a miniatures painter who already has all the necessary tools as well as the experience to do it well and quickly and also much more than if done at the factory since its easy to train for repetitive work where materials like paint get cheaper with economies of scale. A miniatures painter otoh is already planning on spending a significant amount of time painting the minis including cleaning them beforehand so and likely this is where my unfamiliarity with the hobby has me too biased I dont see it as that much added effort to strip the paint beforehand if that is even necessary from what Ive seen xwing for example is painted thinly enough that people just paint over that without significant loss of detail and I would imagine a single coat and wash to be similarly thin.Basically if miniatures are aimed purely at painters I can understand them being sold untouched. But if a miniatures board game was truly aimed at board gamers I cant see a good reason not to put in a minimum effort to bring them up to boardgame quality painting given the cost of including them in the first place.,boardgames,dg4tjri,1,t5_2qmjp

I used to think that Ill just wait for a game to go to retail before I buy it since itll almost certainly be at or below retail on Amazon at some point. But sometimes a game might not see the light of day if people dont back it. Ive decided to only back  KS campaigns at a time and once one ends and Im certain my copy is secured Ill find a new one. But now that Ive actually gotten on the KS Bandwagon I have to admit that its kind of exciting. I get to see if the project reaches stretch goals and see how many people are getting on board. Its fun to root for something now that football season is over. ,boardgames,dg9b1z3,4,t5_2qmjp
11586890,0,t3_65d0ez,Did you consider a scenario supplement with a buntch of one shots? Things we could play with newcomers or as an alternate to the main campaign?,boardgames,dg9dqir,6,t5_2qmjp
11587308,0,t1_dg99ilg,Yes the idea for Founders of Gloomhaven came around the time we sent the Gloomhaven files off to the printer. It really was perfect timing because I finally had time to start working on new designs. I would say it was largely inspired by the Flash game Factory Idle where you are building these complex supply chains in a confined space and trying to maximize your output through spatial reasoning. The design as evolved significantly beyond that so that the concept is barely recognizable mainly because that sort of stuff can become very tedious when translated to a board game but that is where it started. Ultimately I wanted to capture that feeling of spatial building logistics chains but I also wanted it to be a competitive multiplayer thing where you are all working to build the same thing but are competing over the points and resources.,boardgames,dg9ffw0,19,t5_2qmjp

11635290,0,t3_65vtwm,WSIGHey Im looking for some inspirations for some new games.Number of Players Looking mostly for  players but the typical  players games are fine too.Game Length Max time  hours if the gameplay is entertaining for everyone. Long player turns are fine if they arent every round.Complexity of Game From a scale from  to   beeing not complex at all and  beeing you literally need a PHD for this game I would say an .Your Budget Not relevantThemes   Like anything before the industrial revolution Greek Mythology Fantasy Middle Ages Renaissance etc. Dislike anything after the industrial revolution World Wars current time alternative timelines like Steampunk Futuristic etc.Mechanics I think I enjoy most mechanics as long as the rules are clear and strategy is important like resource management or RiskReward management. It is important that the game should not feel like that RNG decides the game but it should still have RNG elements to keep it fresh.Competitive or Cooperative BothGames I OwnLike Dominion half of my current card boxes have the name Dominion on it Settlers of Catan My Gateway Game only playenjoy Basic  Seafarers Dead of Winter I really enjoy the Cooperative part while still mistrusting everyone  the resource management Epic Spell Wars I love the name easy setup quick and fun games  Caverna I love the planning resource management but havent played as much will most likely be bored of the none random game start Secret Hitler see Why Game X over Y Exploding Kittens see Why Game X over YGames I OwnDislike Dislike does not mean that I dont enjoy them just that there are some flawed mechanics and for some I already found better alternatives for me see Why Game X Over Y. List does not include games I really despise like Monopoly and the other classics EldritchArkham Horror Setup is too long rules feel sometimes overcomplicated so far most games were fight the rules Cards against Humanity  others language and culture barriers can be annoying as not everyone in our group speaksreads perfectly English and having to google every second card becomes dull Werwolf see Why Game X over Y Munchkin see Why Game X over YWhy Game X over Y Secret Hitler over Werwolf in my opinion Secret Hitler is just an objectively better game than Werwolf as it gets rid of all the flawed designs of Werwolf like Closing your eyes for mins The Noise in the Night Argument BoringBad roles Focus on roles than arguments and so on Exploding Kittens vs Munchkin both are Games of Attrition but EK has a fixed game end while Munchkin can drag on forever. Second the Deathblow in EK is actually a Deathblow while in Munchkin you still have to play after losing all your gear all hand cards all levels against the wellequipped level  characters of the other players. Also Munchkin has also unclear rules.Games on the way and why I bought them Archipelago I like games which are cooperative and competitive at the same time. the secret objectives are interesting and the game feels like a nice complex version of Settlers of Catan  Kingdom Builder I love the planning ahead trying to keep the options to have good turns while completing different objectives Grand Austria Hotel I like the theme as beeing Austrian myself the resource management but I am more skeptical about this one than the other twoThanks for your help,boardgames,dgevfp2,1,t5_2qmjp

11713047,0,t1_dglvkxq,Ive been playing is since the original in the binder. An absolute  without hesitation. I enjoyed the  release because they screwed it up so much it was like playing a whole new game in fact I had forgotten most of the details of the cases anyway. My group just started the Jack the Ripper expansion. So far it is MUCH better than the  reprint of the core game. I worry about what this group will do with the license once they tap all of the fantastic cases created by Sleuth Publishing. The change they made to one of the cases in the core game made no sense and made it the weakest and most unsatisfying of the cases. I wish Sleuth could get the rights back and continue making new expansions.,boardgames,dgnpbtn,1,t5_2qmjp

11726906,0,t1_dgokonw,Yea Chicago Express tends to be a very sensitive game where the poor actions of one player dramatically affect the game for everyone else. For instance if one player has tons of money everyone should probably null auction so the rich guy cant just take all the shares. If a player however puts shares up the rich guy can just sweep them all and that may just decide the game then and there. The game is quite brutal but it is brilliant and its one of my favorites.,boardgames,dgp9x6i,2,t5_2qmjp

11751092,0,t1_dgrpss9,. this isnt true at all. People complain about sexism in games no matter the scale. This is the exact same issue. Its just a PC inversion of it. . So the only it can be sexism is if theres an equal number of all girl characters? That is extremely flawed logic. The trend is arguably more important as that indicates current thought in the matter. And the trend is largely towards inclusivity. . Fair enough. This sub is extremely uninclusive because concerns raised by men are not treated the same as concerns raised by women. Im not saying that I dont have choice. Im just saying that when I raise concerns the only response I get is its time you feel how it felt for us or of you dont like it play something else. In addition to my comments getting down voted into oblivion. My point is that on certain issues about inclusvity the people who play are ironically not very inclusive. ,boardgames,dgs0ku2,2,t5_2qmjp

11757651,0,t3_67qw3v,Looking at my own tastes the timelines are pretty similar. There was a string of permanent favorites in the late s to early s that I think have held up handsomely Symphony of the Night Age of Mythology Windwaker concurrent with Carcassonne Torres Samurai and Alhambra. In the same period there were old favorites that have been replaced by superior successors Morrowind Halo Pokemon and Dragon Warrior Monsters concurrent with Bang Munchkin Citadels and Buffy.There are some older board games that still interest me e.g. Acquire Quarto and Catan but I cant really think of any video games that hold up the same way. There are NES and SNES titles I would still consider fun in a vacuum but I dont think I would ever play Super Mario Bros or A Link to the Past if I could play Super Mario Galaxy or Twilight Princess instead. Maybe Tetris but even then I would rather play a newer version with a hold feature and the ability to speed a piece up by pressing the down button.,boardgames,dgsrctz,1,t5_2qmjp

I loved it even bought the Broken Token insert the only other game I have one for at the moment is Star Trek Frontiers. I say loved because I later on got BSG.During the first time I played BSG which was earlier this year I quickly realized where the inspiration for Dead of Winter came from and the fact that they didnt actually improve on it in my opinion lowered my opinion of the game. I still like it a lot and I plan to keep it.The betrayer mechanic in Dead of Winter pales in comparison to BSG. The quick pace despite long game length of BSG is also nicer in my opinion. I stay invested between my own turns because I am trying to figure out who is doing what and why and there is a crisis at the end of everyones turn rather than just at the end of a full round of turns like in Dead of Winter. You only ever control one character too whereas in Dead of Winter Ive seen where one guy drew a bunch of cards in a row that got him a bunch more characters to control so basically I could take a power nap between my turns.Dead of Winter works well at p and p which BSG kinda doesnt. So Ill keep it for that. If I have p though Ill choose BSG every time.,boardgames,dgt7sd9,1,t5_2qmjp

11780346,0,t3_682fv2,It seems to me that your criteria for a long lifespan is that the basic setup of the game is very different game to game. In Agricola you get different cards and the order that actions become available differs slightly. TTA the timing for when cards come out is a huge variable and Terraforming Mars is much the same though even more random. It seems like you want to react to what is available and that creates longevity. But I would argue that there is another type of longevity though perhaps one that doesnt appeal to you. And that is the longevity of nuance and mastery. If you do the same thing every game thats more of a problem with you as a player than the games. Im not saying that is a negative about you just a negative for you and a game being a good fit for each other. Because if you arent winning every game you play then you should be finding a way to play differently than you did last time. And if you are winning every time by doing the same thing then that is the fault of the players that play against you.,boardgames,dgvc903,3,t5_2qmjp

There are  decks for each sector containing planets aliens resources trading stations etc... You draw as many cards as many boosters you have on your ship. And it feels simply great when you upgraded your ship to the max and then are able to fly deep into the deck zipping by planets you visited earlier and finding the precious resources you suspected are there... deep in space .... eh the deck.  or stumble eventually into some powerful enemies. Havent seen this unique mechanic anywhere else. Great memory helps so you can fly into deck  to visit the uranium planet and resell the uranium on the trading station you discovered in sector .
