Leaving your boyfriend sounds really extreme and if you cant take a couple of comments from his brother and are I willing to let him break you up then this relationship bbc.co isnt going ton last. Your boyfriend needs to have a talk to him about being respectful. He doesnt have to like you but he does have to be civil. Only you can know what you can take. If you really cant stand it then you have your answer. ,family,cinkeab,1,t5_2qmf5

He is a child throwing a tantrum and I have a feeling you were all giving into him because of guilt and pity. If you want to move out you should.

1876654,0,t3_2g1be7,I went to college at  as a singleparent when my daughter was almost . I graduated with two majors in three years with a . GPA. I had some financial support from my parents and I also worked parttime on campus. My school gave me needbased scholarships so while I still have about k of debt it would have been much more annual tuition as my school was about k.Its totally doable if you are a diligent student. Classes dont take up that much of your time so your kids would only be in childcare for a few hours a day. Professors are often accommodating I had to bring my baby to class once or twice. It can be lonely though and you miss out on all the normal college stuff but I was already sober and wasnt going to be partying a bunch anyway so that didnt feel like a big price to pay for me.My daughter is now in first grade and Im planning to go back to graduate school next year hopefully and during that time I would like to remarry and have another baby. I think the hours are more manageable and because you can do your work anytime of the day and from home its a lot easier to accommodate school and parenting.,family,ckfbvx2,3,t5_2qmf5

I had an issue with my parents and thats basically what they said too. My parents didnt tell me to pick up my stuff though basically probably because they knew Id come and try to reconcile. Plus I was already living on my own then so they knew I had what I needed  there wasnt anything essential I needed to pick up. I think this also made it all a lot less permanent?  It might work for your daughter as well  especially if you think shell be back soon. Hopefully it goes well with you and your daughter!,family,cp5mv6e,2,t5_2qmf5

Its not that you can never be there for him just that he needs to start cleaning up his own messes.The truth is you dont have to.get dragged down with him or clean up after him.

You are not entitled to more schooling. With the rising costs of colleges they could be afraid to of leaving you with a mountain of student loans.

I know you werr worried about your mom etc. but the ends does not justify the means.You are right that you dont have to let anyone in your life. That is youe choice. However you have some choices to make. I dont condone cheating and I would be upset too but your dad is an adult and allowed to make his own choices. If he cares about this woman and wants her in his life that is up to him. If you want a relationship with him tou are going to have to learn to be civil. You are never wrong for feeling a certain way. It makes perfect sense ti be hurt and not to like this woman because of the circumstances. But she is a part if your dads life and if you dont accept that you are going to destroy your relationship with him. There is no way around that.It doesnt sound like the marriage was happy. It is possible that the marriage was over long before the affair but the affair is what pushed your parents to make it official. It doesnt make things right but does give a nit of perspective. It is hard but you are an adult. Sometimes you have to be civil to people you dont like. Only you can decide if you are going to forgive your dad and try to make it work or if you are going to give up on having a relationship with your dad. He cheated on your mom. Even if this relationship ends that wont change. Either that is a deal breaker for you or you can learn to move on.,family,dbj6xmg,1,t5_2qmf5
