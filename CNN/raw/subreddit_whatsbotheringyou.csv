411464,0,t3_1ymk1p,Its been said above but dont let it bother you. Senior year of high schoolFreshman year of college I thought I wanted to be an architect and like you applied for the UT Architecture program. Since being an architect major I have been an English major photography major graphic design major and then scrapped all of that and went to grad school where I got an MBA. My senior year self would be amazed at the job I have now. And yes at the time he also probably would have been depressed my architecture dreams didnt work out. But there are things out there and talents you have that you may not even be aware of. So keep plugging away. Regardless of being accepted by a specific major take other engineering classes. You may be amazed how much you like chemical engineering which may then lead to taking more science classes. Who knows in  years you may be laughing with your med school classmates about the time when you wanted to be a petroleum engineer. The best advice  go to college and explore. Take a variety of classes and find things that inspire you. While its nice to have a well thought out career plan sometimes its nice to let things develop and see where it takes you. Good luck college is amazing and Austin is even more amazing. ,whatsbotheringyou,cfnexek,2,t5_2xvyd

It seems like you care more about a checklist of what should happen in a relationship talk then date then make out then girlfriend and less about these women as people. Slow down focus more on getting to know them as people and less about a formula of how to achieve girlfriend. Maybe youre cracking jokes at the expense of asking questions or letting them talk?
