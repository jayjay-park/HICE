It will take a bit of time to become accustomed to the way things work here so I would really recommend hopping in an auto and high tailing it to HyperCity a mega mart grocery in Malad w should run you  Rupees. Everything is tagged bagged and scanned and as a newly arrived American the last thing I wanted to do was quibble over veggie prices.Depending upon where you live the neighbors may descend on you. Its probably your best bet to live in a shared flat or as a paying guest your transition into the restrictive society will be all the more smooth...Theres tons more...but Im on my phone...if you have any questions you can just pm me..

Try to avoid local trains in rush hour just for your safety. You should use Zomato to find nearby restaurants as you can read reviews and decide. Use OLA or UBER stay away from local yellowblack taxis if you dont want to get scammed. It would be great if you take a bus to travel. If you drink then you should get it at airport when you arrive as itll be duty free. Enjoy the nightlife. But remember and I repeat always remember that there are police checkpoints at every few meters. Follow law and youll be fine. If you want anything need any help or if lost contact me here.
