I took a  jump trip to Gamma Velorum and back last night and I specifically sought out bright stars along the way to make sure I didnt run myself into any norefuel zones. Id estimate  of my stops where yellowwhite stars GF so perhaps  of them G. Together with the ish I had visited previously in the game I came to the estimate of about  G class.Bah.I was hoping you had some kind of neat trick or something. ,eliteexplorers,cmi1y2l,-1,t5_32zd0

2808152,0,t1_cnn90yw,Yep ideally itd be n squared but n is anywhere from  to  billion so it pretty quickly becomes impractical to operate against the full graph. At some point you need to convert the distance graph to a plot graph in D doable with some trig but unless you have a complete and more importantly accurate distance graph of your points you cant guarantee that any point you generate barring translation or rotation changes will be correct. To account for that you need to keep a super position handy for every point. And each point needs at least  ds to other points to get a super position of between  and infinite points and while adding more distances to a point can increase the likelihood of having a correct position that range doesnt change. Actually now that Im thinking about it a super position can be   or infinity points but not between them.... Anyway if you have a superposition you can redraw the graph as more information is added which you do for every distance you examine and thats a logarithmic reclusive operation in the worst case and a more or less n operation in the best case. Tough to parallelize because its not a tree you cant ever truly call a node done without a complete graph.    Still thats not to say its impossible. If you curate the distance data so you dont run into conflicting or too poorly rounded data and keep a running chart with super positions on each point ignoring the impossible to chart points with infinite or  super positions and accepting that each point is a sphere with some arbitrary but small radius to accommodate the lack of truly precise distances you get from the galaxy map you could probably plot a d chart with a minimum of  distances from one point to other known points.,eliteexplorers,cnna18k,1,t5_32zd0

4202817,0,t1_crz1ls9,As uNexolek mentioned you just need to drop down towards the galactic plane a little. A good tip that I was given for long range navigation is to concentrate more on the grid than the stars.Zoom out so that you can see the ly or ly grids. Zoom back in when you want to pick your route destination. The grid coordinates are XZY coordinates. Sol is at  Sag A is at roughly .The tip that I was given was that for most places that you want to visit youll already be in roughly the correct place in  axes so you just need to correct your position in the other .So in your case you need to first bring your Z axis position close to zero to get back onto the galactic plane. Then concentrate on heading north along the Y axis while slowly adjusting your X axis position towards zero. Once you get to around  you can start heading directly towards Sag A. Unfortunately youll need to overcome the core plotting madness before then. Basically youll find that when you are within about ly of Sag A your plots will get stuck at  for  minutes or much longer. You need to try to find your magic number this number will always plot within about  seconds. Once you find your magic number use it for every plot. I can always plot any multiple of ly in  seconds in the core in my .ly range Asp. My magic number is ly .

4711622,0,t1_ctoeotn,I havent done a careful comparison but I did do it the way you suggest for awhileat least if by full stop you mean throttling down to zero while remaining in supercruise. You cant actually go slower than  kms in supercruise even when throttled to zero this is why you cant turn flight assist off to coast in supercruise while you turn freely you always have forward velocity.But assuming were talking about the same thing then I compared a bit and decided it was slower for a few reasons. First the closer you are the faster a scan completes so if you are asymptotically approaching the planet youre scanning the scan will be faster. This is probably a small difference though.Second and more important I think is that acceleration without the confounding factor of gravity wells seems to be basically sigmoid very slow at the lower bound then faster and faster in a nearexponential rate then slower again until it becomes an asymptote. I think this is what you see in videos where people have tried to see how fast they can go by just accelerating constantly away from a system. Based on that without the influence of the gravity well you will certainly be able to speed up from X to Y more when X is farther from zero the supercruise lower bound is effectively zero for this calculation.But to what extent do you benefit from staying out of the gravity well? I think youd have to try it very carefully both ways to see whether the gravity well impedes acceleration more than the gain. I think thats the point of the SLOW DOWN indicator I think thats when the gravity well is going to confound your ability to accelerate. Thats the point of my throttle back upon scanning to stay out of the SLOW DOWN zone. But theres certainly a deceleration effect when passing by jovian and stellar bodies even when youre not close enough to get the SLOW DOWN.Im trying to think of how you could make this less anecdotal but it seems kind of hard. Maybe go way above the ecliptic until youre directly above a planets pole the drop to normal space make note of the distance to the planet. Target the planet exactly deadcenter and enter FSD with throttle at maximum and head for the planets pole without touching the stick. Note exactly at what distance the scan begins while doing it the zerothrottle way. Time the scan this time cant be shorter than the throttledownbutnotzero method so it serves as a ceiling. Then repeat starting from the same point above the pole in normal space this time throttling back to  instead of .For both trials at the time the scan completes immediately pitch up until youre parallel with the ecliptic and time how long it takes to get to say c since thats a common innersystem velocity.I dont have time to try this right away but Im interested to see the results.,eliteexplorers,ctofst9,2,t5_32zd0

6165326,0,t1_cypzwq0,Plotting twards the core with route planning of  LY is the best way to go. Get the B fuel scoop if you can dont get the A one as it is too overpriced unless you dont care about  million orso more  Anyways biggest fuelscoop you can get In general with this big fuel scoop you only want to scoop when the tanks are almost empty. When you hang around a star you lose alot of time in your jumps. But be sure to have a quick check on the system map so you know the next star is scoopable. On my way back from the core I myst have had dozens of jumps where I just got lucky to land in a scoopable or one was near as I stopped paying attention to the map while jumping. The advantage of the big Asp is that if you have the indicator that your main fuel tank is dry you can still jump a significant distance.. in every case when I thought Oh dear I landed in a system with a T star and Im doomed there was a scoopable nearby to reach with the last bit of fuel.. but dont count on it. ,eliteexplorers,cyqfn0a,2,t5_32zd0

6373759,0,t3_42yjgh,Theres definitely some other non Horizons players in the fleet but I dont think anyone knows how many. Certainly the majority seem to have Horizons and all the actual planned meetups happen on the surface of planets. Thats partially because its easier to actually meet up and interact there where you can use latitude and longitude to determine a meeting point but also because DW was originally just Erimus and Kaiis plan for a Horizons followup to Erimus original journey. It was never expected to grow to such proportions!I think your best bet is to just be in orbit when the meetups take place and chat with commanders coming and going. Youll almost certainly be able to wing up with players Horizons and vanilla alike and do some travelling and exploring in wings.Someone correct me if Im wrong but I believe that if you buy Horizons while you are out in the black your ship will still automatically get its planetary landing suite. This will allow you to land and join the meetups even if you dont have an SRV. Personally I dont use my SRV during those meetups anyway Im there mostly for talking with the others and taking nice screenshots... See you out there Commander! o,eliteexplorers,cze4k5d,1,t5_32zd0

I have been playing towards the core in an Asp since the beginning of January and I am only k ly out of inhabited space. The reason why I argue to visit nebuale first is because space madness will hit you hard. If you havent explored before it can be very daunting to go for the core on the first go. The first go is to get the feels for it and to learn what to do and what not to do. Nothing worse than selfdestructing at k out or accidentally crashing into a  G planet and lose all because you did not prepare by testing first. I went out k in a t for my first trip and learned heaps from that. Took me only a week or so to go out and back and made  million on it as well. Found that  heat sink launchers and only one afmu is really needed. Heat sinks are for that time when you crash into a star when not if because your attention was a little off.

7057259,0,t3_4ca2o1,How to never accidentally drop on a neutron star or any star really Always throttle zero as soon as you enter hyperspace. This is easy with an analog throttle and with only a keyboardgamepad Ive been told enabling flight assist during the countdown works otherwise just spam the set throttle to zero key when you exit hyperspace. If youre throttle is at zero when you exit hyperspace you will never hit any star unless you walk away for half an hourzero in supercruise is still kms. Dont hyperspace from supercruise when adjacent to a neutron star Ive never found this necessary for any other star type its too easy to not angle away enough before throttling up to lineup with your destination. Instead drop to normal space at throttle zero. There you can maneuver freely without fear of dropping you already dropped!.Black holes dont scare me with regard to damage only neutrons do. But seeing the distortion field of a black hole zoom past my FoV freaks me out.

7454865,0,t3_4hgsir,The fuel tanks are dead weight  its very unlikely for you to travel more than ly without the ability to scoop some fuel unless you intend to push for certain areas near the galactic rim in which youd need every LY of jump range anyways.Id recommend to disable the power distributor wont do anything for you anyways and cargo hatch so you can use a smaller power plant with safety margins if your modules get cooked at some point.Fill every empty utility slot with AFMUs so you can repair your ship in emergency situations and so that heat damage is equally distributed to all available submodules i.e. less damage to each single module. Apropos heat damage Slap some heat sinks on if you can because at some point we tend to do mistakes which may become very punishing without one or two of them.The rest looks alright to my eye whichd result in this build proposal note the proposed power management setup.If you dont want or need maximum jump range add another fuel tank or two but Id advice against aiming for more than    ly of dry travel because that simply is unlikely to be neccessary if you pay some attention to your next jump targets.,eliteexplorers,d2pkk78,1,t5_32zd0

8177669,0,t3_4r96m0,I have both ships currently. Im working on upgrading them through the engineers. With the grade  fsd upgrades in both im only getting a difference of  lightyears between ships.  in the asp and  in the conda. Well see how much more that will be in grade . The Conda is quite the fuel hog as others have said. you get roughly  jumps before you are out of fuel. The conda is quite slow which can be annoying when flying in orbit looking for points of interest or specific latitudelongitude. Id say stick with the asp for now but if you got the credits lying around then by all means try out the anaconda. ,eliteexplorers,d4zrb5j,1,t5_32zd0

9791196,0,t3_5fdea2,Try not to over think it. Its going to take a week or more of time no matter how carefully you optimize your route. I made the trip in an ASP over a year ago and it was borderline unplayable so I think youll be okay with all of the improvements. I made thousands of jumps and never once jumped to a black hole or neutron star. I dont think the auto route ever selects them. At the time I went it also seemed that the incidence of brown dwarf systems dropped to next to nothing. It used to be a gamble every time you let the ship route for you that you would get a long string of browns and have to manually ditch to find a fogkbam to scoop. The real danger I encountered were double triple and quadruple star systems. And given enough jumps it will happen to you. You jump in and either fly through a star or find yourself between two stars almost touching. You just have to keep calm and not act rashly. I recommend some cool shots equipped just in case. When I got back from my trip my ship only had  hull damage and that was purely the result of a disconnectcrash on warp that wasnt my fault. One bit of advice is get a good routine going of what you do at each jump. I usually throttle back as the count down goes just before the jump. This makes it so you jump out at idle giving you a lot of time to get the lay of the land. If you drop out and dont immediately see a star you will be at idle and can figure out where the hidden  stellar mass objects are. You will also save a lot of time if you get a good rotation going on scooping and when to hit the FSD at what heat level to jump right as you hit high heat but before you take damage.  I will usually fly in real close at high speed to super scoop as I orient on my next jump point. If its behind the star I fly shallow or deep so that I will be full before the jump is in site and I trigger the FSD while still scooping but low enough that I wont take heat damage. This is almost a meta game after awhile how fast can you scoop and scoot and how quickly can you FSD jump without taking heat dmg. ,eliteexplorers,dajz7pz,1,t5_32zd0
