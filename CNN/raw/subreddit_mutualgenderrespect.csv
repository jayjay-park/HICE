10298655,0,t1_dc9116m,gt I am subbed to rEgalitarianism for this reason but that sub is dead.Sad no?gtrMensRights is the closest you can get to an open dialogue about gender issues.Have you really tried elsewhere though? I mean I know you were banned from rfeminism briefly checked your post history but where else? I was somewhat active on rfemradebates for a while but found their comment policing too strict for my liking. I got banned from rfeminism as soon as I showed up and every post Ive ever made to rmenslib has been deleted by the mods for not being one reason or another and Ive decided I just dont agree with their approach to mens rights. Oh I used to comment on rtwoxchromosomes but got banned for playing devils advocate in a rape support thread I literally just posed a hypothetical IIRC and absolutely wasnt questioning or criticizing the OP. There are tons of other places to talk about gender issues though which I confess I havent tried all that much e.g. rwomen rmen raskwomen raskmen raskfeminists etc. ,mutualgenderrespect,dcbeph5,1,t5_3ifgh
