1446965,0,t3_2aoqyp,For DesignI followed Bjangos workflow its pretty helpful in terms of working for both xx asset sizes. The only thing I did was work at x instead of the reverse. Depending on your timeframe I think this is fine as I usually fit in time for polish and tweak out any funky aliasing. Whichever way you go there are a lot of actions that he provides in generating both xx asset sizes. Here is his workflow again the new version of Photoshop CC does generating easier but you can read both and see whats best for you.Also for previewing your designs from photoshop on your device Skala or LivepreviewUse these as itll give you way more context in your designs and actual use in your hands.For ProductionI provide asset sheets PSDs AND using the latest version of Photoshop CC  it exports all the PNGs automatically Learn more about the generator tool If theres an issue with naming conventions the developer has the PSDs to name them appropriately. Its pretty rad saved so much time.I usually do asset sheets for global elements that are used throughout the app then sections  but thats just me.Hit me up if you want more details with my workflow and good luck!Oh ya and a cheatsheat for all UIGUIs for the native functionality!iOS Cheat Sheet,UI_Design,cixnj0d,5,t5_2vqtk

Especially for mobile apps moving prototypes are one of those things that not many people know how to do.But in general Read Apples HIG Read Googles Material DesignThere are a bunch of books and other resources on more generalized UI and UX design but those two documents contain pretty concise overviews of all kinds of common mobile interface principals.,UI_Design,cj5ncyk,1,t5_2vqtk

2907084,0,t3_2tf2y9,You can paste psd into Illustarator and vice versa so it doesnt really matter. I personally use Illustarator because its much faster than using Photoshop. I tried Sketch but I didnt see a reason to switch to it from Illustarator which I already know very well. ,UI_Design,cnyjja5,1,t5_2vqtk

5443154,0,t3_3pl8sm,I havent done this kind of thing in years but when I was an artdirector Id mock that shit up first. Design the photo like youd design anything  sketch colour scan Photoshop...whatever it takes to give you the feel of the final product. It can be rough as hell  but it sets a goal for your shoot. You have the added bonus of placing your mockups into your site  see what colours and compositions work before getting out your camera. ,UI_Design,cw7eyoj,1,t5_2vqtk

5820756,0,t3_3uv2by,All of my favorite applications I use on my phone come with a night mode. I love having the option to shift between light and dark.So my opinion is go with both and introduce a night mode switch set to off by default.In your app store promo images display both the light and dark versions so users are made aware of the option. Everyone gets what they want.,UI_Design,cximjr5,3,t5_2vqtk
6021132,0,t1_cy8sbik,Thanks for the input. And the icons are literally just a picture they choose to go with the schedule.

10663215,0,t1_ddft88i,Great first crack dragonbornrun. If you can handle feedbackcriticism then you will do well. A key way to learn is to make mistakes  I do like how you have rendered your design it makes it easy to understand how it will look.Apple and google both have guidelines for touch area. Our UX team go for xpx as the default size sometimes xpx in a pinch based on iPhone x.Search for Material Design SizeTapTargetsApproprirately not sure if Im allowed to post links here. This is googles answer based on DPI. There is an older article at UXMatters which is quite good just search for UXMatters Common Misconceptions About Touch.When you do a UI before starting think about the user and the various activities that you wish to address. When you then design a UI walk through the mockups for each activity and look for the pain points. Doing a quick Gorilla test is also useful sometimes called hallway testing just walk someone through your ui can be a relative friend anyone really.  Btw welcome to UI design. There is a lot to learn but its a fun activity. There are principles behind visualgraphic design can be applied to UI design. Gestalt colour theory and some others are really useful.Btw my apologies if Im telling you how to suck eggs Im just not sure on your background or knowledge. I do love seeing someone have a crack at something new and love to encourage and help!,UI_Design,ddftv55,3,t5_2vqtk
