290277,0,t1_cfauhbm,I recently tried it out and I quite like it! Like the name suggests its big selling point is that its clump free mascara application. I find its good for natural looking lashes  its lengthening makes your lashes slightly thicker and obviously youre not going to get those clumps that tell the world yes I am totally wearing mascara right now.I wore  coats for about half a day even had a nap in it and the mascara didnt seem to smudge or transfer to my skin so its pretty long lasting.

I tried to do a light hand application and then a more intense application. It might just be the colour I picked but the more intense application kept going blotchy. It really does stain the lips too. My fingertip is all stained from trying to even out the colour. Although I really like the colour I would not recommend buying this colour.

1102797,0,t3_26qpur,Oh man it feels like this question was made for me haha.    Ive got probably a half dozen of their single eyeshadows in mattesparkleholographicsatin finish. I actually really like them I use Party All Night and Cappucino Please at least once a week without fail.  I also have about  of their Metal Glam eyeshadows they have a lot of overspray on the top layer but as you get a bit further into the shadow they have pretty good colour payoff I usually only use my metal glams to highlight the inner corners of my eyes.    Their eyebrow pencils and their clear brow gel are really good pretty inexpensive for the job. I like to use the gel just to tame my eyebrows sometimes as a clear mascara.    Ive got two of the longlasting twist up eyeliners in purple and blue. Pretty damn good quality for the price I was lucky to get mine as discontinued colours so they were about  ea at Target! I use them on my waterline and on the lid pretty beautiful colour! I have a metric buttton of eyeliners but nothing like the Essence one     Ive tried maybe  of their mascaras? The volume curl in the squeezy weird tube like toothpaste the brush was pretty difficult to work with but it looked okay. Ive also tried the old orange and black tube cant remember the name but had a long straight rubber brush. Was pretty good cant complain! I had the Volume mascaras in the big thick tubes in the blue big volume and the silver volume curl I think theyve since been discontinued they were pretty good for .. The last one Ive tried is the one they have out now the I Love Extreme big thick pink tube with the black writing THE WAND IS FUCKING HUGE. I personally cant use it because it is waaaaay too big for my tiny Eurasian eyes but it did surprisingly give heaps of volume just way too intimidating for me lmao.    The nailpolishes are pretty good cant complain as well as their quick dry drops base coat top coat. Some nail protectbasetop coats were discontinued in the last  months made me really sad I liked them. Nailpolishes probbaly dont last more than  days on me depending on what I do with them on.    Ive got some highlightersbronzers from the trend editions pretty good no complaints they do the job.  The matt oil paper stuff is good I probably go through a packet a month Ive stocked up on them because they are really good for the price and easier than buying stacks and getting them shipped from Asia.    Lastly Ive tried their longlasting lipsticks and their matt longlasting lipglosses in the tube which are almost like nyx matte lip creams. The longlasting ones are awesome I have two from the Tribal Summer trend edition I really love and Coral Calling from the normal line. Really good  The lipcreams are not too bad they come in three colours a rosy pink rosy brown nude and a red. The rosy pink is horrifically awful settled into all my fine lines in my lips and didnt set but the nude and the red were lovely! Cant complain for . or whatever it was.    I cant remember if Ive tried anything else but for me personally Essence is a hit  of the time. I love their stuff for the price!,AustralianMakeup,chtn7ca,13,t5_2ys2j

1812594,0,t1_ck71fqa,The only conclusion I have come to is that they choose to use premium mail services  which DO cost  and up because it covers their butts. A TON of packages do get lost in international amp domestic transit so if they allow their customers to choose the cheaper option for shipping there is no insurance or guarantee the customer will receive their goods Aokay and they can lose a lot of money that way from having to refund money to customers for items not received. By forcing their customers to use a premium service it almost  ensures that the customer will get the goods and if they go missing they can file a claim and have the cost of goods refunded to them by the freight company which allows them to resend replacement items out to the customer so there is no loss to them.Companies like Cherry Culture etc and even Beauty Bay who allow these cheaperfree options probably lose a LOT of money in refunds for items not received. The shipping methods they use do not have tracking so they cannot check something has been delivered and have to go on the customers word and either refund or replace the items at a loss to themselves in good faith to the customer. ,AustralianMakeup,ck7lgoa,1,t5_2ys2j

For other options some I have but havent tried yet some I dont have Manic Panic Dreamtone this is really hard to get your hands on in Aus now but is a cult favourite BarryM Foundation Crme shade  UK Brand can only be bought online Illamasqua Skin Base  a popular option some people find the SB drying Face Atilier Zero Minus a popular option but a touch pricey Yaby they also have a large range of mixers in other colours,AustralianMakeup,cpavvfa,0,t5_2ys2j

3391037,0,t3_2z17fx,It probably depends on the store but my friend told me she was able to change a foundation that she was incorrectly matched to at Mecca. If you explain that youve received multiple comments about how the colour is wrong and bring a picture of yourself wearing the foundation in natural lighting then theyll see you were given the wrong shades. If not you can try mixing the Clinique foundation with your BB cream to make it a bit darker and I know you probably dont want to spend more money but maybe a matte bronzer could help bring colour back into your skin  ,AustralianMakeup,cpeszmh,11,t5_2ys2j

The coverage is pretty light on but I tend to go a bit nuts with my concealers Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Eye Concealer for my undereye area and Benefits Boiing for imperfections so that amps up the coverage where I need it most. On top Ive got my Bourjois Healthy Balance Unifying Powder which Im lovinggggg.My eyebrows are lightly filled in with my HG Anastasia Beverly Hills BrowWiz pencil and mascara is also a HG  Maybelline Full N Soft. I actually bought the Kevin Aucoin Curling Mascara the other day after reading some great reviews here.

Their healthy mix foundation is seriously lovely and all the shades run yellow. I think you might be a no. . In Priceline you can use the testers to check your colour match.

I can tell you what to avoid Foundation with a inbuilt brush tip  the products ok. I just dont like that design. Im not sure if the brush tip is detachable but if it isnt thats unhygienic. Its designed to not waste any foundation but youll need to wash that brush tip regularly anyway.  Ultimate Contour Palette  the packaging felt cheap the product felt cheap and not worth the price.

5603092,0,t1_cwqmpc7,If the only big releasename eyeshadow palette you own is the Naked  I totally agree with uchevronbird! Diversify your collection! How do you know the UD eyeshadow formula is even HG for you?Buying THAT MANY palettes from the same brand when its what I gather is the only midrangeandup palette that you have just does not seem like a good move. From a collectors standpoint maybe  if youre going for completions sake. But in terms of building a versatile collection of eyeshadows that you will get full use out of? Definitely not. Take it one carefullyconsidered palette at a time and try some other brands and formulas. You said you were looking to build colour into your looks  well the Naked Vault certainly isnt going to give you that. The UD Vice  and KVD Vida Loca palette are also going to be very expensive for a first foray into incorporating colour into your makeup looks. Not only that but reviews have been mixed on both palettes and the packaging on the KVD palette is seriously impractical. There are a lot of more reasonablypriced options you can get for beginning to build colour into your looks. Chi Chi Sleek Inglot and indies only if you dont mind loose shadows come to mind. Were you thinking you would want to try every colour of the rainbow on your eyes? Or did you have maybe a few shades in mind? Because with Inglot you could choose just  shades to start off with and get really great quality with whatever finish you want theres sooo many variations at Inglot and challenge yourself to see if you can consistently use these colours before you go deeper and invest in a palette FULL of colourful shadows only to have them sit in a drawer gathering dust. If youre worried about the limited edition palettes selling out... remember that UD comes out with a Vice palette like every year and there are always opportunities to buy these or other older colourful UD palettes secondhand on MUEAMUE. ,AustralianMakeup,cwrm8nw,3,t5_2ys2j

Here are the swatches in crappy indoor lighting sorry for comparison for your interest. The first image picks up the warmness better in the colours but the second picture picks up the colour differences better. The last three swatches I added as other suggestions  . Maybelline in Nude Perfection is almost perfect dupe for Savvy Lights...Camera except not matte and if youre after more brown than pink.  . TheBalm in Charming is probably the most pink but still quite warm if youre after the mauveish side of things.  . Lipstick Queen in Coral sinner version is probably my favourite mix of everything. It is a satinmatte formula so not completely matte! and it is the lovechild between KVD Double Dare and Nars Jane.

Currently using LOreal TrueMatch which I surprisingly find quite decent Im NC and got the shade W Golden Beige. Its still definitely not a bad idea to keep blotting sheets near you. I heard Rimmel does decent foundations too.

Although it makes for a really good application  especially really liquidy foundations like Nars all day luminous no streaks and really gets the product on your face. Another one is the real techniques buffing brush also the expert face one but I havent tried it its soft and only a little dense and gives a really good application.

It goes great over the top of most foundations bourjois healthy mix Mac face and body loreal cushion but can cake up on more matte and thick formulas like Rimmel lasting finish.

8581130,0,t3_4x6n2j,Thanks for the PSA I didnt know this. The old beauty club rewards were really quite good  I suspect they probably changed because it was costing them too much since the introduction of the Farmers Club card. Quite a lot of stuff comes under that beauty category it can be easy to rack up those points. Restricting the beauty club points to high end brands will make it next to impossible to ever redeem any rewards which is probably what theyre going for. Unfortunately they also just removed pretty much any incentive to actually buy makeup at Farmers because lets be honest  the only good thing about Farmers is the range of testers,AustralianMakeup,d6e864a,2,t5_2ys2j

9850280,0,t3_5ge08t,Firstly congrats on the state of your LIFE with that paycheck!!!!Eyeshadow KVD matte palette is amazing. Solid investment love it. Naked One and two arent really that pink Naked three is the very warm one. Zoeva En Taupe and Naturally Yours are also great ops with amazing pigments. However Chocolate Bars are always a great option because they have SO much diversity. I would probably go with both of those in the end if not just the first chocolate bar too faced.Brushes Check out a zoeva set! Beautybay has them at a very reasonable price. So cheap! If you can find the tarte christmas brush set thats also a great option. Contour KVD kit is also great in this respect. My favourite cream contour is actually a stick foundation from the priceline Savvy range that could work. Foundation Lancome Teint Idole  Hour Ultra is great for dry skin  Its at Mecca. Go with the Mecca hydrating primer as well! As for powder Id be really careful. Even with oily skin if I place a powder foundation on top of any cream coverage product I look flaky. Id invest instead in a good foundation and a great translucent powder for setting or a setting spray UD All nighter. ,AustralianMakeup,dariixo,7,t5_2ys2j

Certain companies are notorious for late boxes and services which make it very hard to unsubscribe See Her Fashion Box as an example.I played with a few boxes a couple of years ago and found the service to be rather lackluster. I was receiving  items but there were maybe  I wanted to try and the other four were either too small to have any noticeable effect or products which werent suitable for me wrong for my skin typeskin tone hard to use colors etc. At  a pop I found I was better off just buying myself a treat each month from a brand I was interested in. Its worth it if you are able and want to use all of the products in the box but otherwise you might just be throwing away money for the deluxe samples and products which you can get in Mecca Myer or Sephora for free.,AustralianMakeup,ddwa7wi,12,t5_2ys2j

11158451,0,t1_dewcwxk,I dont have the F but I do have a Zoeva rounded kabuki brush and the Sigma F.  I love both but I do find that the round top lets you get into the curves of the face more around the nose and you get a little more control.  The F is good for the flat parts of the face like cheeks etc but I find it more difficult to get into curves.,AustralianMakeup,dewsr6s,1,t5_2ys2j
11239248,0,t1_df5xv34,Oh no  the only other thing I can recommend is a gel liner used with a flat thin stiff eyeliner brush pushed right up against your upper lashes but not quite on the upper waterline. I do this sometimes when I want a bit of definition but dont want it to look like Im wearing lots of eyeliner. I havent tried any brands available at Priceline for gel liner Ive used the Stila and MAC gel eyeliners but Ive heard good things about the Maybelline and Rimmel gel eyeliners. ,AustralianMakeup,df5yas3,1,t5_2ys2j

11453268,0,t3_63bat4,I think they have really underestimated the youtubebeauty guru influence.  I had never heard of sleek thebalm or elf until I started getting into youtube. I dont know if that was a major factor in targetkmart acquiring these brands but I feel like it makes a lot of sense.  I dont know if it would work but I wonder if they would be able to send PR to big Aussie youtubersinfluencers? If so I think these products would market themselves to an extent.  Genuine hype already exists for these products so why not take advantage of it? That aside I think a lot of people are sick of paying stupid prices for drugstore. I think it would be awesome to see this sort of shake up in the industry.,AustralianMakeup,dfu7wn7,3,t5_2ys2j
