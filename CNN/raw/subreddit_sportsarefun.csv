The chasers have to gain control of the ball in order to leave the middle of the circle and stop chasing the ball while the passers have to pass the ball around without letting the chasers touch the ball. The passers can only touch the ball once. I assume that the chasers had to get control of the ball after number of passes and since they didnt they got punished by the friendly slap tunnel.,sportsarefun,d8s0r57,31,t5_2ynme

Are you suggesting the only time a player can practice against this live pitching is spring training?  Thats patently absurd. And youre also suggesting that rundowns are practiced more than hitting and fielding mechanics which is whats on display during spring training?  Again absurd. Whatever Im not trying to change anyones mind. This far the only counterpoint to my claim has been its spring training. It doesnt matter  if thats true then none of spring training matters aside from separating fans from money and generating mlb income. Suggesting there are only certain aspects of games that are relevant to be trained is foolish. Especially at the professional level. ,sportsarefun,dera84m,1,t5_2ynme
