If its the correct format I can go ahead and extract it from all the other videos and start the project with them.To download a version of the file first click on the language then the file will appear on the right panel. Click the arrow pointing down to the left of the filename and itll say Download translated .srtIf everything looks correct Ill set up the project with everything and start making noise about it.,TheGreatWarChannel,cp410h1,1,t5_34g7g

5659465,0,t1_cwylerz,At first many countries cared about the Hague and keeping some form of honor and dignity. That really went out the window as the fighting ground on and casualties reached the millions. Once the powers involved in the Great War realized that this war would be a long and bloody total war the gloves really came off. Anything to give an advantage and break the enemy morale was considered and tried. From bombing civilian ports to unrestricted submarine warfare zeppelins bombing cities and the eventual use of poison gas. The tipping point was right around MarchApril  for when Germany really stopped giving a fuck about the Hague and others were quick to follow suit. Everyone rationalized it in their own way and many had differing definitions for what was supposed to be acceptable under the Hague so that didnt help much. Did the soldiers themselves know about the Hague? Id say many likely did. Knowing what was acceptable how to treat prisoners and how you were supposed to be treated if captured was considered important.As to if soldiers were told to do or not to do this I cant possibly say. It would likely vary by commander but even more than that doing this sort of thing requires actual tools and actual skills and knowhow. Reloading ammunition after taking it apart can be very dangerous. You have to get the seating depth for the bullet correct in the cartridge or it wont load into the magazine or chamber into the rifle. If you mess up the powder charge it can either not fire the bullet out of the rifle or it can make the rifle literally explode in your hands possibly taking a hand with it. So this sort of thing would have HAD to have been done behind the front lines and by a somewhat experienced armorer. That would say to me that in the locations it was done that it was okd by the commanders. Now all of that said I am curious where it would have been used most. In World War  exploding bullets were only used by snipers on the Eastern Front. Russians and Germans both viewed each other as total scum and held nothing back apart from gas in WW. But on the other hand we see that this practice never really happened on the Western front. Things there followed the conventions much more often and were more...civil...as it were. Id be curious if this was the case for the Great War as well.,TheGreatWarChannel,cwym0oa,2,t5_34g7g

8175765,0,t3_4r9dfx,With the advent of mobile warfare in the Second World War the trench systems of the first world war and the extend that they were employed at were a very rare occurrence however there were extensive trenches used on the Eastern front notable examples areThe Battle of Kursk July  the Russians dug km or  miles of trenches in  belts which was km  deep. This could include tank and infantry trenches as well. A few pictures of the sort of trenches at Kursk The Siege of Sevastopol October  to July  had  or  rings of trench networks that surrounded the city although they probably were not solid unlike World War . Sadly I cannot find any statistics of their defences. But here is a picture of German soldiers in a trench during that battle.Also the Siege of Leningrad   September   January  where the Russians dug km  miles of antitank ditches km  miles of barbed wire and many lines of trenches. Russian soldiers in shallow trenches and this. Lastly the at the Battle of Moscow   the Russians dug more trenches around the city again sadly I cant find any statistics on how many kilometres got dug but I found this photo of women digging antitank ditches Also Battle of Stalingrad August   February  I cant find much information on trenches there but they did exist in a large amount. Heres an album I quickly threw together The Germans used trenches extensively on the Atlantic Wall as well as their West Wall. Japanese used a lot of trenches on their island defences. After World War  In the Korean War both sides used trenches in the stalemate  the French used a  trench network in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu  March  May  and as did the Americans during the Battle of Khe Sanh  January  July  and a few pictures of the network During the IranIraq war  September  to August   it turned into something which resembled World War  style of trench warfare. ,TheGreatWarChannel,d4ziqr7,7,t5_34g7g

I was reminded of Modern Warfare  whose very last level  the last of a trilogy  places you in a very similar setting against a hotel full of mercs rather than a mountain full of Austrians of course. A triumphal and moment that comes at the climax of a trilogy  an effect I dont really get from that BF mission because the game doesnt make you work for it.,TheGreatWarChannel,d93a02x,2,t5_34g7g
