1286798,0,t3_28thim,Did NCSoft ever stop your botting empire?Also you are one of the reasons I never got into playing on official servers. I tried a few times but the bots really put me off. Did you get the impression that botting was part of the gameplay? I mean did it seem to you like everyone who made it botted?,Lineage2,ciedq7z,3,t5_2sw04

2866552,0,t1_cnttt21,Its decent if you dont count the dozens of critical bugs they have. Also its hellbound chronicle. I would ask to be paid to play on that unbalanced uninteresting chronicle. ,Lineage2,cntxeto,-2,t5_2sw04

2931504,0,t1_cnzgxg3,admin is known for stealing donations aswell as banning players for no reason. GMAdmin team is corrupt as fuck and citaldel is just a remake of their old pvpx server where they stole thousands in donations from players. If you want to play on a corrupt server with admins that will run off with the communities money once they get their pockets full enough go ahead and play on citadel.,Lineage2,co1bnv2,0,t5_2sw04

7031570,0,t1_d1d5s4v,I see i did a account last night and i made a run for GludioDionGiran and the server was pretty empty Skelth server on L Classic EU but maybe it was the time that i logged or its just that the server is pretty new. That is why im trying to figure out if this server has enough population to spend time playing it.,Lineage2,d1ddsv7,0,t5_2sw04

9842794,0,t1_damywg0,Yeah probably because of the donation and  weapons shitshow thats going on in the private server scene.  I swear I havent seen a good midrate server since ages.. I just dont have the time for Dawn anymore.  Sometimes I wish there were an instant PvP server without progression aside from epics and  enchant cap. Im that desperate for a bit of L fun. ,Lineage2,daqjf3a,1,t5_2sw04
