1499035,0,t3_2ae9fa,Someone on instagram pointed out that the movie has to be rated R to capture it properly but that would suck because of its younger  fanbase. I am  and after reading it I think that unlike Paper Towns where a lower rating would completly change plot points and essence of  certain characters omitting that some of the more explicit stuff wouldnt really alter the story too much. I would prefer that the language stayed intact but I do not know if the moment with Lara really changes anything. I would suggest A so they could get all the language in though. I just finished the book yesterday and I am so excited to hear it is going to be a movie. This is the first time I have read a book that will be adapted before it was casted so having the actual cast be different than my head cast will be weird for me but I am excited. This is the girl that the fandom has casted in our minds as Alaska and I gotta say I think she is perfect and she is becoming very popular so casting her would give the movie a great boost as well. ,lookingforalaska,cj46fgv,2,t5_31qjd
