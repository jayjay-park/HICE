651771,0,t1_cgeclg5,I would urge you NOT to give yourself the option to assess whether or not the Beast is attainable.  It is just do it.  Running with your hubby and buddy is prime.  Remember the more the merrier so get some others in there for the Beast.  Youll pull one another up by the bootstraps.  I promise you you can get it done its just commitment.  I would say  hours is very optimistic.  Our team was out there for . on a mi trail.Someone on another thread said its not like they release the dogs after you or anything and its entirely true.  Its your pace you decide if youre going to run job walk how fast youll attack the obstacles.  I would advise packing Clif Shot Blox.  They curb appetite and fuel you without weighing you down.  They saved my ass last time and they are easy to carry in the bra pockets fanny packs etc.I promise you that you can do it.,spartanrace,cgecu4i,2,t5_2ugdk
904133,0,t1_ch6upzk,Oh almost forgot. With regards to the Spear Throw. Feel free to experiment. His workout technique is sound but his grip location really is best determined by each user. They can have the back of their hand on the balancepoint line and throw straight. I use exact same placement and the rear of the spear always fans out. Always. So I tinkered with location and MY best is exactly one hand width behind that balance point. So Im gripping slightly more towards the back of the spear. Which makes sense for me as that is the nature of the product based on the physics of weight distribution. Starting at the middle balance and gripping more forward will have a heavier rear balance. I believe where I grip it the spear head has just slightly more weight than the rear of the spear thus allowing it to lead the flight path.Your results may vary. So make a spear find the balance point mark it with a sharpie and then practice over and over again with hand placement. As for what I used to make my spear. I used this rake handle with complimentary ferrule attached for  Prime shipped. It is even predrilled in the front. Then just got a steel carriage bolt that fit in  I think and some gorilla glue. Its holding well thus far.,spartanrace,ch72009,1,t5_2ugdk

5365816,0,t3_3ogj64,I had the opposite impression of EtherBoo  This course was brutal...   What made it brutal?  One word mud.  This was by far the muddiest course I have ever done in my Spartan career.  The obstacles were clustered so you had large gaps of running then backtoback obstacles.  The hard part was trying to keep a pace on the long run portions.  Burned every muscle fiber in the calves and hammys.  This also extended into the spectator area.  I have come to expect the spectator areas to be just as dirty as the course itself so this did not bother me but I can see where it would be a draw back to others. The obstacles were about what you would expect with Spartan.  I was among the first elites to get to the ZWall and heard  bell.  EVERYONE failed it because of the rain mud and sheer lack of grip.  It was GLORIOUS!  Rope climb proved a challenge simply because of the amount of mud on your shoes and hands.  Also no knots not even for open heats. Course layout could have been better there was a big group of elites that cut the course without knowing as the tape was hard to see and many were just following the runner in front of them.  Some where around mile  there was a yellow jacket nest that got stirred.  I personally got stung  times.  Also heard reports of dead snakes in the swamp area though I did not see these myself.Final thoughts  I felt that this course in the super category was much harder than Asheville but not quite on the level of Wintergreen.  We can speculate all day on how easy or hard it could have been without the mud but the fact of the matter is that mud was the essence of this course.  I hope they do it again like this next year.  I would highly recommend this venue as it was very unique.  I feel like Spartan got back to their pre  roots here with the sheer amount of mud on the course.  I will definitely be back again next year if Spartan returns to this venue.,spartanrace,cvxjl81,8,t5_2ugdk

7524596,0,t1_d2wzsdh,I enjoyed the course but I have to agree with a lot of this.  The parking was a shit show.  The volunteers were letting people with wd cars go into an area where cars where getting stuck constantly with no warning.  At least tell me I might get stuck.  There were  people stuck directly in front of me by the time I actually got to the parking lot which slowed down the whole line of cars all the way out to . miles away from the venue.  We waited almost  hours to travel . miles and park.  This made us late for our heat compounding the bottlenecks for everyone.  On this particular course there was a lot of narrow trails where you cant pass which made the bottlenecks pretty bad.  In several spots I found myself holding a sandbag or bucket of rocks waiting for people just standing there to move.  I dont run the competitive heats yet so Im used to a lot of people walking but this race was pretty bad.  There were only a couple spots where I could run.  I do have to disagree with the scenery which I enjoyed.  There was at least one spot where the trees all changed into pine and it was like I was in a whole different forest.  What I would really like is accurate mile markers evenly spaced along the course and if you ask a volunteer what the remaining mileage is they actually tell you the truth.  Thats my biggest problem with Spartan races.  I budget my water energy and food so I can maintain a strong pace and make it to the end without burning out andor injuring myself but thats almost impossible in a Spartan race.  I guess thats part of the mental challenge they talk about but it makes me lean towards other race brands.,spartanrace,d2xichu,1,t5_2ugdk

8573121,0,t1_d6d76li,Yeah I think the reality is that my top gear is slightly lower due to the fat oxidation process being less efficient than using glucose for fuel. Im never going to be a top elite without carbs but I can be competitive. I accept that as a consequence since my knees hurt so damn bad before that I wouldnt have dreamed of running two miles let alone a super in the mountains! Also I feel better altogether and have gotten pretty shredded. As for creatine the well researched version is good ole creatine monohydrate which is cheap. It doesnt require a loading phase as many people still believe to get all the benefits. You do retain a small amount of water just FYI. Not gonna help you run faster but will help for your other training. I stop taking  it before a race because being light is more important to me personally on race day. I am already pretty strong. As for supplements magnesium is a must for a Spartan! Its key to muscle function for high or low carb athletes and is the root culprit for many who suffer from muscle cramps. Sodium is important too but if you get cramps often its probably the mag. A high percentage of Americans are likely deficient but its hard to test for. I would strongly recommend a mag supplement. Avoid Magnesium Oxide. Its next to worthless. It competes for absorption with other minerals in your body and has very low bioavailability good to keep you regular haha. I use Magnesium Citrate from Vitality Now. Its bio available and cost effective. Any of them that end in ate will do. Sodium and potassium are really more important after training. They are abundant in GatoradePowerade. Your body sweats them out. I preload them using litesalt to stave off cramps and fatigue when I train. But thats partially a consequence of diet. Electrolyte management is key for me. Wow that turned out to be a long post! TLDR I wax poetic about my supplements. Edit Misinterpreted your mixed results comment haha.

One week isnt enough time to make any significant improvements. That said I find if I dont move a little for a full week I get a little stiff and creaky.

9635221,0,t3_5cxrb3,I agree I did the Fenway sprint also. It was normal heat and there was much cheating. I took it with a grain of salt. But it is disheartening to see that it is that way on the competitive heats. Well mostly for me I just compete against myself and those that came with me.,spartanrace,da0qn64,2,t5_2ugdk

9795957,0,t3_5fijzo,Personally I have pretty good gripupper body strength so I just go right up using my hands with the only technique being that my palms are facing towards by body and I use small reaches rarely going much above my head for the next grip. Here is a good tutorial with options from the rope climbing world record holder ,spartanrace,dakkaee,3,t5_2ugdk
9985701,0,t3_5iks94,My biggest goal this off season is getting into a strict routine. Ive gotten a bit complacent this year and have neglected the weights in favor of running more. So now its time to regain what strength Ive lost and continue my running. ,spartanrace,db95y3l,2,t5_2ugdk
10107068,0,t1_dbontjf,Thats on him for not having the correct cold weather gear. Anyone who stepped out of their hotel roomcar etc. that morning knew the temperature and knew what the course had to offer including a frigid alpine swim. No other racer was allowed this sort of pass and its unacceptable. If you want everyone to be following the rules that means everyone no exceptions. If you arent prepared to finish the course and do the penalties or arent prepared with the proper gear then that means no completion no medal.We all have jobs and some of us still had to go do our jobs the next day but did they get special treatment? No. Its our choice to go amp do a Spartan race and then go to our jobs. Spartan up. ,spartanrace,dboynop,2,t5_2ugdk

10265901,0,t3_4uibw9,Any new advise for deferment?  Im  weeks out before my Spartan Sprint race and now have a conflict with a friends out of town wedding.  Paying  for deferral fee to only receive  credit seems like a slap in the face when I already paid  to register early with a coupon.If I do move forward with the deferral is there a time limit to when I can use it?I do have a female thats interested in doing the same race as me.  Does anyone know if she can use my bib if she signs up and says she is Scott?  Or do you have to show some form of ID?,spartanrace,dc7p297,1,t5_2ugdk
10412926,0,t1_dco9nva,For gloves you could definitely do a simple mechanix or other type glove such as mad grip.  You then can just put any normal glove or mitten over top.  You would then take off the big fluffy glove for anything like monkey bars and tuck them in your pants.  You dont wantneed anything thick and need good grip.  The purpose is just to protect from the super cold metalsurfaces.  The outer glove then keeps you warm but has no technical requirements.These are more general gloves.  Nice for hauling workingI have the mad grips pro palm.  They are really good on bad grip days but wont keep you warm by any means.,spartanrace,dcodfow,2,t5_2ugdk

10562570,0,t3_5r2isb,I cant speak for them but I recently bought some of the All Terrain shoes from Reebok and theyre INCREDIBLE compared to the Speedcross s.  Theyre MUCH lighter drain x better dont hold the water in and have incredible traction even on obstacles.  Since you can find them in a store I would look for those qualities in the shoe and if they look like theyll do all of the above pretty well give them a try.,spartanrace,dd5dxjv,1,t5_2ugdk

11461810,0,t3_63hqh3,I think with INTENSE training you could complete the Tahoe Beast.However it might be a miserable experience and you could wind up injured or at the very least bruised sore and scratched up in the weeks before your wedding. Its kind of a tough situation here youre looking at the HARDEST Beast to try out in the worst possible time for you.Id focus on the wedding this year OR consider doing the Dallas or Seattle Beast if youre intent on a trifecta.,spartanrace,dfv6t8g,2,t5_2ugdk

11672255,0,t3_66jxsi,spear throw  go to your preferred big box hardware store buy an oak shovel handle. Stand back and throw it through an old tire.  Or there are bunches of videos on youtube showing you how to make a Spartan spear.Traverse  aside from tying a rope between two trees.  You could just practice the exercise.  Go to a playground with monkey bars grab on the side rail not the rungs with hands on opposite sides of the rail pull your lower body up like a crunch so that your anklecalf touches the bar.  Alternate legs.  While this doesnt simulate the movement of the traverse it will work most of the same muscle groups. ,spartanrace,dgj2ebj,3,t5_2ugdk
