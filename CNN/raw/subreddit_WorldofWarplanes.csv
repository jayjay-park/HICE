688560,1,t1_cgij0dy,In Realistic Battles the whole energy thing does very much play a role and it is more realistic than WoWp. But WoWp energy is a better game. In RB in WT you have an awful lot of downtime. WoWp keeps the maps smaller and reduces the vertical playing field you use by adding powerful boost and very narrow optimal altitude bands. Boost and energy management in WoWp is a game. Your boost and height are resources and you spend them. Its not the most realistic in that regard but it isnt meant to be. In WT arcade energy does not matter. Well it does but only in a very limted way. You need an incredible energy advantage to be able to make use of it. Aircraft stay way more controllable at and below stall speeds making it very hard for you to stall slower planes out and maneuverable aircraft have an innate advantage against their more speedy brethren because of that. Arcade in WT is Ufo vs Ufo and while thats fun its also very shallow. RB is way better in that regard but it suffers from immense downtimes because unlike WoWp climbing is a chore that takes whole minutes. And frankly i cant be arsed to spend  minutes keeping my plane climbing while nothing happens at the start of every round. if you spend your energy thats it. Unless you spend  minutes climbing again. And that simply doesnt work in an environment where half your team does nothing useful because as soon as you attack and invest energy you are automatically at an disadvantage against anyone higher up than you and no backup in sight to clear your tail.In short energy in WT does not matter in Arcade and matters way too much in RB to be enjoyable in short bursts. Give it a try. you might like it. But in my opinion WoWp strikes a better balance between realism and arcade. And the progression in WT is just ridiculously fucked up in WT.,WorldofWarplanes,cgijh89,3,t5_2t19v

1720743,0,t3_2e3jf1,Im not sure if I read his pilot advice correctly.What I would do is take the starting  pilot and keep him at  in the hanger till tier  or . On tier  I used a throwaway pilot because the experience to elite was so much less than the xp to train the pilot.That might not matter though because the last  is where all of the required experience is.,WorldofWarplanes,cjw2a8u,1,t5_2t19v

Even if the problems were fixed the low population and bad image make it really difficult to recover.Maybe itll get a reboot in the future theres nothing in theory that should prevent WG from making a successful planes game but this incarnation is more or less defunct. ,WorldofWarplanes,cv89ckm,3,t5_2t19v

6114254,0,t1_cykkidd,Some people dont like the higher tiers but myself I love it. The game completely changes once you have to start dealing with jets.
