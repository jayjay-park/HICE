He was enjoying them immensely not even bothering with venturing out to get salsa or any sort of dip. No these chips were perfect. Yes I see that... where did you get them from? David asked fearing his answer. They were in the cabinet. Tom said simply eyeing David carefully. He paused his eating when Davids eyes widened. What why? Tom asked sitting straight and no longer lounging. Those were Melissas. David said and Tom froze in shock.It was that time of the month... Melissas to be precise.,SimplePrompts,conw79p,1,t5_36cvc

4483995,0,t3_3ciihu,They say hearing voices is bad but I like them.Because they drive me to do what I love.Once upon a time...No not like that. start out another way idiot!Oh right. Everyone starts out like that...When the World was young before the roots of civilization took place...See? Thats better! Keep going!There were two Gods together they looked upon their creation...What are their names?Um...Luna and...Youre talking about the Sun and the Moon arent you?Yeah that was the basic idea. You see I had this idea that the Sun and the Moon made the Earth...And that they were like the Beginning of the World.See thats a good idea a simple outline but it leaves room to expand! Good job!Yeah the voices condemn me so I do better but they also praise me when I do well.Or at least when I think I do well.,SimplePrompts,csvvfn4,5,t5_36cvc
4493188,0,t1_cswbzku,Beautifully described final moments before a terminal decision utempsper.  I figured people reading this prompt would remember Hey man nice shot. at least.The duality and coincidence of the moment is interesting yet hes still thinking about it.  It makes you wonder psychologically about the contagious effect of seeing a suicide when youre already somewhat suicidal instead of what logic seems to dictate that seeing someone else do it should be a deterrence for someone thinking about it.Quite good!  Well written evocative imagery powerful word choices for the subject.  And for a moment there I thought hed actually gone through with considering the choice of words.  Had me hanging a moment. ,SimplePrompts,csx0xp3,3,t5_36cvc

4530445,0,t3_3d3glc,The man heard a pop behind him and when he turned around puzzled he stood face to face with a baby blue figure roughly the size of an average man with a tuft of orange hair on its head. The creature had no discernable facial feature other than two black eyes and a goofy lopsided smile plastered on its face. uh hello? The man said cautiously unsure if this creature was hostile or amiable. Im Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! he said flailing his arms about his voice a near unbearable screech. Mr. Meeseeks? the man said baffled staring at this alien creature What do you do? I help you with whatever you need done! Look at me! Im Mr. Meeseeks! Mr. Meeseeks replied never dropping that odd smile. Right... well i guess you could help me come on Mr. Meseeks I have a job for you. Im Mr. Meseeks! Look at me! Mr. Meeseeks replied walking off with the man leaving his box behind in the grass. As Mr. Meseeks and the man disappeared into the horizon a green portal of swirling ooze opened right beside the box. A man with disheveled white hair sprouting from his scalp wearing a white lab coat and khaki pants stepped out from the portal picking up the blue box Here it is! I knew I left the Meeseeks Box lying around here somewhere in the other universe. I should probably see if some poor bastard who doesnt know the rules pressed the button The man stared at the box for second and burped and a small amount of green vomit came up covering his bottom lip and chin but then again I dont give a fuck! and the man stepped back into the portal to a world unknown.Later that day Detective Roker arrived on the scene with blood spattered across the hallways of Matthew Grants home as police were baffled at no signs of forced entry finger prints hair or any discernible DNA. A cop appeared by his side and asked What are we gonna do Detective? This is the seventh homicide this month all the same M.O. and no leads the people of this city are getting antsy we have a killer on the loose. Detective Roker rubbed his eyes in frustration and sighed deeply We are gonna catch this killer I swear it.,SimplePrompts,ct1p58z,1,t5_36cvc
4547927,0,t3_3db74z,There was no tranquility in that nights silence. It was a tangible noiselessness a state that weighed heavy on the soul as it flooded the chamber and drowned the eager bodies within. In this echoing silence they stood watching the large steel door with bated breath. They saw themselves in its sheen a grim party staring intently with eyes devoid of hope. A true marvel of science lay before them. Man had conquered land sea and space this door was a step in the journey to conquer the flowing river of time. The man that stood inside was currently witnessing the mysterious future of humankind.The turning of the hinges failed to pierce the oppressive silence yet it sent a jolt through the surrounding throng. Reflection gave way to man as the door swung open and revealed their noble traveler. The face was familiar but its expression was new A tempered excitement had been dulled into a look of weary awareness.As he fell to his knees the silence collapsed into anguished throes of sobbing. They dared not speak as his tears were evidence enough of their fate. The fog of uncertainty had been lifted revealing that they were indeed too late to change their course. ,SimplePrompts,ct3w326,2,t5_36cvc

6573931,0,t1_cziqtao,Hey there.gt Everything had its own aesthetic....nothing was out of bounds for technological advancement.Great sentence to introduce the story divine graceful the stuff of those incredible scifi artworks from the early s. Im picturing silver chromed cars with sloping chassis and hovering sleek spacecrafts androids lumbering about. gtAn apartment complex what many would call it so long ago it held quite a few rooms and a number of strange fixtures that come standard nowadays.A bit awkward could work better as two separate sentences. Perhaps What many would have called an apartment complex long ago his consisted of a few rooms and familiar fixtures. Just my opinion.gt He saw it again the same beautiful lady that greeted him to the house the first time he had been approved to live here since he was confirmed for living so long ago and somehow got transported here.Another sentence that could flow easier as two. Perhaps He saw her again since hed been confirmed to spend his life in the plantlike structure a beautiful lady with the charming smile or whatever physical description you want. Its that paragraph where you describe each of them in turn thats a bit...bottlenecked I understand your intention to show their differences. Id move the MCs descriptions way to somewhere in the beginning perhaps he passes a mirror on his way to balcony. Then leave the description of the woman right where it is.gtI could learn skills surpass all that humans know and show the worlds and the galaxies that I have more intelligence than the entirety of the human race.Bravo on ingraining some character into an android not making herlike so many AI systemssome machine hellbent on proving how superior she is. In fact shes written in such a way that it seems like shes more human than machine. gt ...lifting a cold breeze to their feet as they spent another day on a small patch of paradise to the both of them.Again just my opinion but Id leave out to the both of them already a bit selfexplanatory and the sentence sounds positively wonderful ending on ...patch of paradise. Brings the story full circle sir!Hope I succeeded in giving you some constructive feedbackcan never really tell when Im critiquing! Great job!,SimplePrompts,czzary0,1,t5_36cvc

9032147,0,t3_53xcfm,So...whyd you do it?Lewis eyes moved from the polished chrome of the handcuffs to the craggy complexion of the detective hovering over him.We know you did it. We have security camera footage and a dead body with your DNA all over it. We just want to know why.Lewis looked down at his bruised and bloodied knuckles. His barrel chest heaved a sigh as he gave a light shake of the head.Youre only making this harder on yourself. Just tell us why and maybe we can get the DA to go easy on you. The smell of blood was still ripe in Lewis nostrils. The ache in his hands reminded him of the tremors of impact running up his arms as he connected fist to face over and over again.Think about it Lewis. Your file says you got a wife and two kids. You work with us they might be able to see you again before youre an old old man.Lewis closed his eyes and saw his family huddled in fear tears streaming down their cheeks. He sighed again knowing what he had to do. He dug into his pocket and produced a sullied scrap of garbage. This is why I did it.The detective plucked the piece of trash from the table and squinted at it. After a long pause he turned back to Lewis and spoke with abject incredulity.
