445562,0,t1_cfqxtoa,To clarify since we live in different towns about an hour apart at the moment there is a good chance that any dog he chose to start working with would spend a substantial amount of its time at my place for the first few months for training purposes as Im significantly closer to training facilities have more contacts in the SD community and have a lot more training experience in general than he does. ,service_dogs,cfqy4if,2,t5_2v0po

2214510,0,t3_2kcphm,I hate that the very first suggestion on here is a positive punishment correction collar. You hardly mentioned your training methods at all so why jump to a potentially harmful tool? Why not get a feel for your training methods first then discuss tools that may help you. A pinch collar is by no means the magic wand that will fix all of your pulling problems. It just like any positive punishment tool can come with its own problems. The easiest simplest and most dependable solution to pulling is training not some fancy collar or harness.  With that being said what techniques other than the harness have you tried to curb his pulling? Have you worked on making like a tree or changing directions consistently when he pulls? I know that you mentioned you can change directions but how often do you do this? What treats are you using? Are they high enough value? How often have you practiced this? Once youve exhausted all of your training options and feel that you need some help getting him under control another really good option is a head halter like you mentioned in your original post. My shepherd has sensitive skin so the EasyWalk harness didnt work well with him. He has a Holt head collar that has been great!,service_dogs,cllbfu5,1,t5_2v0po

2714392,0,t3_2r5bcd,What do you like about the idea of a service dog?  What things are you unable to do yourself?  Has your doctor or psychiatrist assessed you and told you that youre disabled?  Make a list of the things you cannot do and try thinking of it this way is it something a robot could do for you?For example if you drop something and cannot pick it up a robot could pick it up for you.  In order for the dog to be a legal service dog he must be trained in TASKS to assist you in ways you cannot do things.  Would hugging a robot help you feel better?  Probably not and its not a valid task.  ...hugging a dog while crying on the floor of a public bathroom seems a lot more inviting of an idea than hugging a pill.  Yep dogs provide a lot of comfort!  However just because a dog makes you feel better does NOT make it a service dog!  Theres a term for dogs or animals who help us emotionally but are not trained emotional support animals.  Also any doctor worth his salt wont simply prescribe you a SD service dog as the fixall for your conditions.  The idea of a SD is to use one IN ADDITION to the rest of your treatment.  In the case of mental illness this typically means therapy and medication.  We anonymous people of the internet cannot determine whether you are legally disabled or not.  Only your doctor can so Id recommend that you ask himher at your upcoming appointment.  ,service_dogs,cncm69d,7,t5_2v0po
3384792,0,t3_2qutmm,I keep a few legal documents in my pack in case of access issues as many people are undereducated about SD laws Homemade vistaprint.com business cards with brief ADA facts on one side and the ADA contact line on the back. You could instead carry copies of this  TWO copies of any state laws regarding service dogs for states I will be intravelling through so you can hand one to an officer and still have a copy  I highlight any particularly important parts A copy of my dogs vaccine records in a SEALED in an envelope so I only use it in dire situations they cant ask you for this to access facilities but you may need it in case of emergency. Emergency contacts that can care for your dog should also be on or in this envelope  dont forget to label it! A copy of any of my important medical records in a SEALED envelope marked PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION for emergency personnel only on the front  for example medication list emergency contacts and a list of diagnoses. I also keep copies of the letters from my doctors normally used for airline access in this sealed envelope. I have NEVER had to break this seal and I hope I never do.You need to carry these documents because it greatly simplifies any serious access issues or emergency situations if you have the ACTUAL laws onhand to show any public officials before they make any decisions that might inadvertently violate your rights. Plus the medicalvaccination info could save you or your dogs life in an emergency.In the case that state law and federal law dont agree the law which gives the greater protections to the disabled person you takes precedence. So according to federal law as long as your dog performs at least one worktask that mitigates your disability it is by definition a service dog even if you choose to selfidentify as in training. In training doesnt exist federally so the only question is whether or not you fall under their service dog definition or not.If asked in an access challenge I always identify as My dog is in training but meets the federalstate definition of service dog and is required access by law. If they dont accept that I can always whip out my law cards or the actual laws themselves. Keeping these documents in ziplocs within my dogs vest helps protect them from rain damage.,service_dogs,cpe3cge,1,t5_2v0po
3720601,0,t3_32xq5y,Therapy. Its important to develop alternative means of coping independent of the use of a service dog for a variety of reasons. From a practical standpoint we must remember that our service dogs wont always be up for working for one reason or another illness injury scenarios when you may not be able to bring your service dog with you etc.. A service dog assisting with mental health support should be a supplement to existing therapy efforts rather than be a substitute. The more a handler can boost his or her own independence the more theyll benefit for assistance from the service dog.While youre waiting for your dog to come home you may want to consider engaging in new activities which will both serve as a distraction and give you a sense of increased mastery which promotes confidence and decreased anxiety and depression.,service_dogs,cqgdi9m,6,t5_2v0po
4164965,0,t1_cruhlnb,Awesome information but just one thing  shelters and rescues are often two very different things.  Adopt your dog from a rescue that uses foster networks rather than a shelter environment if at all possible.  The adoption fee will be a bit higher normally  but you get the benefit of knowing how the dog acts in a home environment with oneonone attention under more everyday circumstances etc.  Shelters usually cant provide too much information and due to liability and a shortage of resources they dont usually do things like cat testing stress testing housetraining loose lead training etc...,service_dogs,crv0jxj,2,t5_2v0po

8937725,0,t3_52out4,I personally think guinea pigs would be awesome though you do have to have two so if the second one wouldnt be allowed in your housing as just a pet that might be difficult.  You also generally have to have two ferrets and they can be quite demanding.  Check out rferrets for some info on care it might help you make a decision.  You should also know that ferrets are illegal in California and some cities throughout the US so that might complicate matters if you live in one of those areas.  Make sure to factor the amount of care needed into your decision as some people can be a bit overwhelmed by the care for some animals and you want your ESA to help not stress you out!,service_dogs,d7m6kxj,2,t5_2v0po

9657882,0,t1_da35pwd,Well legally all that is needed for any dog to be a service dog is for the person to have a disability as defined by the ADA and for the dog to perform work or tasks that directly mitigate said disability.  But certainly if you meant if your service dogs necessity were questioned by the IRSyour FSA a good form of proof would be a letter from a doctor.

9947505,0,t1_db43sdz,gt It seems so ridiculous that there are websites that charge hundreds of dollars for packages for registering your animal. Thats what made it so confusing for me.It is. It also makes it really easy for people to think just because they bought that that they get to take their doganimal anywhere which is not the case. CertificationID cardvest  Service dog. Service dog  task trained for handlers disability vest or no vestgt If you dont mind I do have a question. I know that the vests and badges are completely optional but do you find that they help when taking your dog in public? I have a feeling I would have anxiety if I was questioned and asked all the time why I am bringing a dog in a store. Maybe the vest will help take some of the questions away. From what Ive heard from handlers generally a pretty simple vest with just service dog or SD in training if your state allows you public access with an SDiT tends to lead to a few less questions. But youre going to get questions either way Im afraid.  ,service_dogs,db46ofs,3,t5_2v0po

10449832,0,t1_dcs7679,I got the impression the pulling was basically anytime she was outside OPs home. I could be very wrong on my impression though.  Also while video taping is not a requirement it has come in handy for me many many times especially as owner trained. Like said church is exempt and schools sometime ask for a demonstration so its not just a dog in their school that is a liability. While my understanding is that legally the school cant force you to show them proof of tasks sometimes just offering from the very beginning has avoided conflict. I am not sure of the legalities on asking for shots however most places like flights trains schools usually like to confirm that the SD is healthy. They feel that cus the dog has his shots and looks clean that its healthy. This one drives me crazy but Ive tried to let it go over the years   ,service_dogs,dcsl2kn,1,t5_2v0po

11693030,0,t3_65kvqj,Hiya. So I have a Psychiatric Service Dog and severe agoraphobia and social anxiety. My therapist was hesitant for me to get the dog because it can aggravate social anxiety but my psychiatrist loved the idea and wrote me the letter.In my specific case I disassociate when anxious and often wander off bump into things mentally check out and Layla does several things that reduce or end the dissasociative episode. She also does DPT for anxiety panic attacks and over stimulation. If Im in a particularly bad way she knows to go get Daddy so that my Husband can step in and help me get the care I need.Learning behaviors that help psychiatric disabilities is one part of the dogs training. Its all great and well that the dog can do dpt but he should be able to do it in new environments with lots of distractions without stopping his task until you give the command. Public access training is big. My girl Layla is massively food driven. When we first rescued her she tried to eat our computer chair. Can you imagine me taking her into a restaurant? Now after a lot of work she tucks under the table and stays nice and quiet. Sometimes in a supermarket she may get sniffy around the dog food aisle but she doesnt beg for food or make any noise. When I stop to browse she lays at my feet. For some reason she really doesnt like being in the therapists office I think its because Im supposed to feel anxiety there and work through it so I dont utilize her and so she can be disruptive lots of alerting nervous posture ect. and so she gets to wait in the waiting room where shes fine.I dont want to be too discouraging. Layla Grace is one of the best parts of my life and getting her has made a world of difference. I can leave my house now!! Its just a lot more work than I initially realized. It was and still is worth it but it was hard and overwhelming at times.As far as social anxiety goes I feel more comfortable in large crowds because Layla can provide a physical barrier between me and people. I feel safer because I know if I get too anxious I wont have a massive anxiety attack. People do come up and ask to pet her but for the most part are understanding when I explain that shes working. I think it helped my confidence because I was very much someone who could never say no but for Layla and I to work as a good team I have to say no. I have had some issues with people asking for her papers but Ive been able to navigate those situations okay. We carry the little cards that have the service dog schpeal on them because it takes a lot of emotional energy for me to deal with that. People do stare. People will ask you whats wrong with you. I decided when I adopted Layla that I would try to embrace those questions and educate about invisible disabilities and mental health so when people ask me whats wrong with me I try to be an advocate. Some days its easier to do that than others and sometimes I just say Im not comfortable discussing my medical health with strangers. I think the worst thing for me is it seems to open doors to other people to tell you about their awful medical stuff because youre obviously sick so clearly youll understand. I had one woman tell me about her gangrenous uterus. You need to be really sure you can handle this because people will interact with you. Sometimes they will be nice sometimes they will very much not be. Laylas presence has certainly helped my social anxiety but that emotional support doesnt make her a service dog. And while its great to be able to take Layla places and know if something comes up I can handle it I honestly hope to one day get to the point where I dont need her to work anymore. I just wonder if its difficult for you to talk to your psychiatrist about your needs then think about how you will do talking to the many strangers some in authority positions about your dog why you have the dog. Some people will tell you that you need papers or the dog cant come in. Thats confrontation and one thats usually best solved calmly and not in the middle of an anxiety attack if you can help it.I wish you the best of luck in whatever care plan is right for you. Anxiety is a big ol bitch and I hope it doesnt stick around.,service_dogs,dglf8uu,1,t5_2v0po
