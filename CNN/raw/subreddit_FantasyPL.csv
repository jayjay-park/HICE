8644,0,t3_1u84cb,I Picked Sterling to be the one I replace because midfield pickings are slim this season already and hes going to lose his first XI spot to somebody coming back from injury soon. The defense switch Im fine making I believe Hull and CP are going to have a stronger second half than Southampton so I dont mind losing out on Fonte. Tim Howard to Jussi was a bit harder to stomach but I needed the money and Jussis been good all season as well me already having Everton coverage from Coleman.

693253,0,t3_223ssg,To be honest youre team is in great shape. Asides from your own remarks in the comments Id say you perhaps want some Manchester City attacking options in your side. The reason for this is not only do they tend to score in truckloads but also they have two double gameweeks remaining and no other competitions to worry about. Take advantage of this by bringing in the likes of Yaya Toure Nasri or Silva. Or perhaps even Aguero whenif he comes back. The team as a whole tends to earn more FPL points when hes in the side.Finally Boruc might be a cheaper option in goal than Mignolet whose defense is less sturdy and has tougher remaining fixtures from next week onwards.,FantasyPL,cgj2pgy,1,t5_2snvr

That said hes not as much of an attacking threat as Ivanovic. I think Ivanovic is due some attacking returns this weekend as he has come close to scoring in recent weeks and always seems to get into dangerous positions. I think Mourinho will rely on set pieces to get a result at Swansea and will play it safe. Id choose Ivanovic over Chambers but both are good options. Hope that helps!,FantasyPL,cgptrb5,1,t5_2snvr

905423,0,t1_ch74o46,This could blow up in my face but I prefer Aguero or Rooney to Yaya if you have either. Crystal Palace was always a game for Yaya  Pulis packed the middle and Yaya scored on a powerful and surging counterattack that also involved some good fortune. I think Everton will play an open game and try to hit City on the counter meaning Yaya will have more defensive responsibility. He could sit a little deep for my liking especially as Pelligrini will field  strikers most likely. Aguero is going to be Citys main man for the title push and while Yaya will probably notch something over the two games I think it will pale in comparison to Aguero and Rooneys hauls.

Players can also be awarded bonus points which are awarded based on the points they gain within a match based not only on the affor mentioned goals assists cleansheets.

1485388,0,t1_cj2gc5g,Youre doing fine it looks like a solid team I think. Maybe you should consider trying to squeeze in one more defender from a top team Chelsea Man City maybe Man Utd to get more of those clean sheet points.

1574625,0,t3_2caw91,Thats a very punty midfield that perhaps is slightly over reliant on preseason friendly form which is never the greatest indicator of how the season will go down. Your defence is mammoth and your attacking players definitely suffer as a result Id downgrade significantly in the backline and upgrade your midfieldstrikers to some proven point scorers which would also allow you to play either  or  which both significantly outscore  every single season.,FantasyPL,cjdnk87,2,t5_2snvr

Ramsey is looking really really good but its just a friendly and Arsenal are without their creative talents.Chambers playing CB. Big chance hell start there the first league match as Per probably wont play yet.Alexis still on bench. edit GOAL! Sanogo scores Ramsey assist. Wonderful stuff from Ramsey there. Maybe I have to add him to my team after all haha!Ok its already  at HT. Sanogo  goals Joel Campbell  goal. Ramsey is an absolute beast. Seems to be carrying over his form from last season. It ended . Alexis didnt play very long but he looked very dangerous on the ball. He played up front so hes definitely a FPL stud!Jovetic scored AGAIN for Manchester City.

Willian was often used instead of Schuerrle in a more defensive setup too as his work rate made up for the attacking threat Schuerrle poses. I agree though that Matic and Fabregas are really the only two midfielders guaranteed to start but I still have Hazard on my team since I think Fabregas will play a bit too deep against the teams we should expect to rack up points against.,FantasyPL,cjicv8q,2,t5_2snvr

1851014,0,t3_2fs3xg,Ramsey has been pretty dreadful all season long although hes been scoring some goals so you never know with him hes always gonna be playing and might score at any point which makes him a good fantasy player. The schedule is pretty tough but the big question is if Welbeck is gonna have an positive influence on the team or not.

1861527,0,t3_2fw12y,My two cents  last year every defense was like holy fuck what is this manbeast of a player doing?! He scored some crazy goals that seemed almost too good to be true.  this year defenders are wise to his immense ways and perhaps are a bit quicker to double up on him whenever he gets the ball from  yards and in.  perhaps last year was the anomaly in an otherwise  regular career in terms of goal scoring?

1894880,0,t1_ckhii12,For me the first time was very different it wasnt really reported by major sources and Costa was training with the squad as normal a bit like Ramsey starting today. Whereas Costa was sent home much like Sturridge was after the st international game now that is a lot more serious than a newspaper saying Costas hamstring has gone again..Chelsea were also up against Swansea who until today had won all  games and until Chelsea turned it on Swansea were very much in charge of the game. I expected Villas make shift defense to involve Baker which it did instead of Vlaar who last time I saw play gave away a penalty and made many bad decisions. Now couple all this together with the fact I was very much onboard the Balotelli hype and I still am give him and the new players time I felt giving Balotelli the armband was the best decision.,FantasyPL,ckhiuo1,3,t5_2snvr

1935343,0,t3_2gtih2, Keepers Poor choices here. You should be spending a maximum of  million between your two keeper choices. Find two keepers who rotate well between each other until gameweek  with decent fixtures coming up. Perhaps Leicester and another  keeper who rotates well with Schmeichel if he recovers soon. In defense perhaps Ivanovic will be played at CB in the future. I went for Azpi as the cheapest way into the Chelsea back . I am now thinking that they wont be very good defensively this season in terms of clean sheets. Their form so far suggests they are going for as many goals as possible. that said there are doubts over Rose. Moreover having a keeper and defender of the same team is a bit too risky in terms of the chances of getting a clean sheet bonus. I am also going for Chambers instead of Koscielny because of the fact that Debuchy is injured for quite a long time. He offers a cheap way into the Arsenal defense but then again Arsenal do not look to be keeping that many clean sheets this season. You will have freed up funds for your midfield so hopefully you can upgrade to Fabregas Sterling etc. Get rid of RVP for another decent striker. Rooney is better. Consider going up top with Welbeck Costa and Rooney if you can afford it or a cheap striker such as Ulloa Naismith etc.Also obsiouly get rid of Elmohamady for someone cheap who might actually get points.,FantasyPL,ckme9fo,2,t5_2snvr

2061277,0,t3_2ifzow,So my choices in the start of the season ended up being awful and in the last few weeks I have been improving the team. The defence is completely renewed and some of the other spots had to be changed due do injuries. The thing is  I honestly dont know what should be my next step or what should be my biggest priority. Last week I replaced Ramsey for Sterling and I guess I should have brought Di Maria in his spot.  Should I take the chance to bring him in now while I still have money since he looks like a musthave for now? Should I opt for replacing WardProwse injured until December for instance for Chadli and then replace Eriksen later? Should I replace Campbell instead? Who to get for attack? Pell seems to be the better choice but Ulloa and now Berahino seem like an affordable solution. The keepers are also the same since the beggining of the season. DDG has paid off this week but apart from that what could I change? Perhaps Krul for Mannone?Please discuss. Thank you in advance!,FantasyPL,cl1u03c,1,t5_2snvr

2257252,0,t3_2l1z0r,As good as sanchez is you have to remember that it was burnley. Arsenal are terrible against teams who play defensively from the start they just struggle to break them down. Look at how long it took for them to score against burnley. Next week they will play Swansea if they look to play more defensively arsenal will really struggle to get many goals. Even if they do with walcott coming back thats going to give arsenal a really dangerous midfield which will make it less likely that sanchez will be involved in goals. He will still get points but I reckon going against the trend and not buying him could pay off. .m can be used better atm in my opinionedit if all of that wasnt enough after the last two games he is going to be man marked and have more focus on him than before. ,FantasyPL,clqpu8i,4,t5_2snvr

Pick up Janmaat like i said Newcastle have good upcoming fixtures and he also gets a decent amount of points.Bertrand  Good choice. Decent price good fixtures and gets a lot of points. Ivanovic  A bit expensive as well but he gets a lot of points id probably go with Terry to save . if i was gonna choose a Chelsea defender.Sigurdsson  Banned so replace him with Elia whos in form and SH have good fixtures.Sanchez  Bench him he will play in upcoming fixtures but not risked on Sunday you dont wanna use a free transfer on him when you know youll get him in.Downing  Replace with Mata although i dont know how much money you have you will be able to afford him if you make som of the changes i recommended.Fabregas  Close one probably keep. I prefer Hazard but its a tough call and he costs a bit more.Naismith  Replace with Ayoze Newcastle good fixtures and hell be first choice. If you want an Everton player i say Mirallas is a better choice.Kane  Replace i wouldnt use him the next  game weeks. Giroud or Sturridge although Sturridge is uncertain.Costa  Suspended Replace with Pelle. Good fixtures and i think he will get back in form.Bench replace Elmohamady with Mirallas. The way i see it you will keep that team midatt for a lot of fixtures after this one while Everton have a bunch of though matches you will still have a good team to field.

4593741,0,t3_3dxtv3,First of all you can do it!   On your  rotation I dont like it.  is the most popular formation in the top k for a reason attackersmidfielders simply score more points than defenders. And its a shame leaving a player of Sakhos talent on the bench.  This is your Agero is rested team how is your Agero is fit team looking? We dont know yet if he will start. If he does start prepare to see his price skyrocket. He will score eventhough he only gets a few minuttes as a sub. I am building two teams one with and one without him. I suggest you do the same.  Have you made plans for how to bring in Sanchez in GW?  I havent heard of a StkCpl rotation before but it might work. If I wanted an Arsenal def I would go Kosc preferences I guess. Yaya is a pun he might be back to old form since he is rested this season. Milner or Hendo take a pick. Ramsey is a good pick but this might be zils big season seing he at long last is rested and fit. Lukaku is a pun but Everton should perform better than last season seing they arent in Europe. Wanyama is a popular .m mid pick. I wouldnt go for a Watford def since they have somewhat horrible fixtures. You might have chosen him due to rotation. Oshea is a good pick. Take a look at Bournemouth players there might be a better pick could be preferences.  Overall your team is balanced. Get your formation right and have plans to bring in the top players and you should be good to go.  One last thing I dont know how your transfer strategy was last year but try to only use your transfers every other week. Having two transfer is a HUGE help and you will suddenly see that you seem to have good fixtures week in week out. Get the right players for the right fixture runs and you should be good to go!

4669506,0,t3_3ewteo,I definetely see Hendo being more defensive this season than hes been before. Lucas will probably be DM with Henderson next to him or slightly in front of him. Can might be used in the midfield again which mean that Hendo might be pushed a bit forward. Liverpool midfielders are generally risky this season because of the rotation potential so if you want to play it safe Id wait a GW or two before getting a Liverpool midfielder.I think the only Liverpool players who are more or less nailed on this season is Migs Skrtel Hendo Coutinho and Benteke. Coutinho might suffer a bit now that Firmino Milner and Lallana are all fighting for spots in the midfield. But IMO hes going to be a regular in the starting XI all season long. I can see Clyne and Moreno being rotated with Ibe and Markovic depending on the formation.Benteke will be the main man but Ings and Balo will probably get some playing time as well. When Sturridge gets back well probably see a SturridgeBenteke pairing up top sort of like suarezSturridge.Anyway Hendo is a good shout for m but its far from certain hell get a lot of points considering his likely new more defensive position.,FantasyPL,ctj570d,5,t5_2snvr

Lukaku has got absolutely horrible fixtures he is a big nogo in my opinion.  Ward plays for a team that has gotten  clean sheets in  games under Pardew. Other .m options are MuniesaSTK and Francis who both have got excellent fixtures.  Gomez is far from secure of a starting berth especially with Moreno splendid cameo in mind.  Watmore plays for Sunderland.  Browning doesnt play you need players that play.  Rest of the team is good.,FantasyPL,cu9c0l1,4,t5_2snvr

5104884,0,t1_cv1bgfe,Arent Norwich fixtures turning soon that could leave Redmond in a spot of bother? And I agree with Barkley but my stubbornness is something stopping me from doubling on Ayew with Gomis already there. I was reluctant to double on City as well triple if you count defence but I think Gkdefence and MidfieldAttack should be treated as separate entities. Anyways without the semantics I am considering Barkley despite fixtures so far he has ridiculed the fixtures and almost proving that he is fixture proof. A good performance against Swansea and he could become the best performer at around  if you disregard Mahrez because no point including him as already in my team and most others for that matter. ,FantasyPL,cv1buo9,1,t5_2snvr
5105200,0,t3_3kxh7n,Ive got my eye on him.  Hes basically a centerforward for Crystal Palace and they have a lot of quality and speed in their attack.

Switch Hart for De Gea so that you can bring on Toure or Silva for Mata De Gea will get just as many points as Hart at way less of a price and ToureSilva will bring in more points than Mata. Also Darmian is a yellow card magnet so youre much better off with Nyom Cathcart or Muniesa in the back Man Utd schedule goes down hill after two GWs and these three backs have good defense and fixtures ahead.

Mane also has greater number of chances created per game and a higher shot accuracy.

I stupidly kept Rojo expecting him to be back this week but turns out its more serious so Ive took him out for Zouma who has fantastic fixtures coming up.As for goalkeepers Ive had Mignolet for ages far too long as hes not been getting many clean sheets Ive just had more pressing transfers to make and it seems Liverpool are starting to come together a bit more now Moreno is a good shout though hes been amazing offensively since Klopp No idea where Im going next but cant see myself keeping Galloway when Baines returns.,FantasyPL,cxmb8yx,1,t5_2snvr

6297571,0,t1_cz39by3,Took a while to find the time to respond to this. Huge breakdown very detailed ten out of ten for effort mate. Generally I think youre right about Mahrez and Vardy. Mahrez in particular. I think Im going to look at shipping him out using the next FT gained this weekend possibly for Alli but who knows. As for the one that Ive been debating over a lot Im tempted by switching Cathcart out for Baines. Theres a lot that seems to be going for this particular switch. Id love to hold on to this FT but Everton playing Swansea at home it just seems right. Regarding the topic of longterm consistency and shortterm fixing I believe this transfer definitely caters to the former!Leaves me with . in the bank but to be honest I couldnt care less. Baines is likely to rise in price and sooner or later I will be using the second wildcard hopefully after February at least. Again touching on what youve said I would be highly likely to play Baines for the next  game weeks. Due to fixtures Evertons scoring form and Baines himself is quite the chance creator.edit looking at FPLstats transfer site he should rise in price before Saturday.,FantasyPL,cz5gnwq,1,t5_2snvr

West Ham defenders are a good call you could get Ogbonna . iirc instead of Darmian also I know Smalling is the only  for United but . is a lot for a defender  you could get Rojo for . and he should be good to play any United defenders feel free to correct me.Sakho for Liverpool at . also. And while Arsenal might rotate their team a bit I dont think it will be too much in the backline so Gabriel could also be a good budget call. Mids and forwards look good but I would personally rather keep Mahrez than have Barkley.EDIT if you really want to go all out with doubles you could go AntonioLanzini for Alli.,FantasyPL,d1iqikk,4,t5_2snvr

We know this is likely not to happen.     This isnt an attack on FFF just what you said which I dont agree with.        A computer can easily see that a player and team are out of form if it cant do that its quite useless. Anyone can look at the top points scorers and say pick them what you want from something like FFF is that it takes in all factors team form player form chances created defence playing against expected set pieces against set piece vulnerability chance of penalties cards injuries etc etc etc and uses that to predict results. All of these have statistical probabilities attached to them with variances that is what is used to compute the expected results.

Sommer is a good choice but try to free up the . in funds to bring in a starting . keeper. Make sure before the tournament starts that Eliseu is starting.

8329411,0,t1_d5ipwk9,Thats fine and I did see the screenshot  I just dont see it as much of a surprise in the cases you mentioned.  Hazard is another example where you couldnt really expect him to drop below  despite his performance last year because of his likely scoring potential.  Its the exact same case with your Sturridge example.  My biggest complaint is prices not dropping enough once the game kicks off.  Its ridiculous how players like Sturridge Costa and Hazard held their value throughout the year when not playing months on end.  Hopefully we get a more aggressive price change formula this season like a few years ago.,FantasyPL,d5iqcl6,1,t5_2snvr

8335910,0,t1_d5jiemm,Having  . defenders over . saves you . mil which is incredibly valuable in giving you better players. For example most Hull fans say that Jup wont be starting keeper as a new one will be bought before the season and even if he is he is shit so not a good option. Giving you the ability to upgrade him means if you have injuries or rests early for Foster then you are able to have points there rather than just . You can also then upgrade Fletcher to someone like Feghouli Fischer or Adomah or one of your cheep strikers  to someone more likely to score etc.The reason you do this in your defence is it is usually with last season as an exception the lowest scoring part of the pitch unless you start going for . defenders which you should not have more than  of. This way you have better other players who are more likely to score rather than clogging up funds on defenders who are only really likely to let you a handful more points than their . equivalents.I would be looking to drop Daniels and Wimmer for Friend and Francis. I think that Circus Charlie is better than Van Aanholt but I personally dislike having two defenders from the same team.,FantasyPL,d5jjkj3,1,t5_2snvr

Either get two rotating .s or one solid . from a top team with a . Hull gk  Get rid of Dier and Drinkwater. Defense minded players are not good in FPL.

I was at a very different point in my life back then  one that Ive worked hard to move on from.Thankfully a lot has changed in my life since then. I have experienced a lot over the past four years and have had to take responsibility for a number of things in my life which has enabled me to mature and grow as a person since that time.I have a lot of regrets regarding a number of things Ive done in the past and realise I have made some big mistakes none more so than these tweets but I would like to stress that Ive worked incredibly hard to completely transform my life since that time.To clarify I do not hold the beliefs written in those tweets whatsoever. I can assure everybody that I am absolutely not homophobic and as said previously I can only apologise and ask for forgiveness to anyone I offended.Thankfully I am not the guy I was back then and will continue to work hard both on and off the pitch to become a better person.,FantasyPL,d70eund,4,t5_2snvr

Payet is great for FPL but is he .m better at FPL than Antonio in current form? Im not sure.

Baines and Charlie Daniels are also decent seeing as they are on penalties. Van Aanholt of Sunderland seemed to score a few goals last season IIRC. Ivanovic has provided a steady amount of goals over the years but Im unsure on him this season. Holebas being classed as OOP is yielding results as hes scored  this season and got an assist already.Full backs dont score as many goals but they do provide more assists.

9369553,0,t1_d93iqya,Lamela had one shot from well outside the box that beat Boruc but just hit post in the first half and he seemed largely frustrated by how aggressively Bournemouth defended. Probably should have been given a second yellow in the first half for a bad tackle right before halftime but cooled down in the second half. He had good intent and a fair bit of zip and kept trying to feed that final ball but again Bournemouths defence was awesome. When he did get the ball he was making runs through the middle but Spurs didnt have many good chances in the box so he didnt have too many direct goal options to assist to. I would say he was about equally as threatening as Son was in the box.,FantasyPL,d93norf,3,t5_2snvr

Defenders will a vast majority of the time play either wingback or DM when they play as midfielders. OP seemed to suggest that wingbacks are a less promising proposition than the other kind i.e. DMs. Thats what I disagreed with. Wingbacks on an average will get more chances in attacking situations than DMs and hence are better for FPL. ,FantasyPL,d99tv38,1,t5_2snvr

Aguero isnt the only captaincy option who scored a brace this weekend.Its the same fucking argument is has been the whole season Aguero is a beast and even if he blanks  weeks in a row it doesnt mean shit. BUT can you do better with the money spent else where?Any team with Costa Kane DefoeAustin Sanchez ManeFirminoKDB is gonna be dangerous as long as it has good d also. A team with Aguero is going to be missing KaneCosta and one of those premium midfield options. Sigurdson allows a team with Aguero to accommodate comfortably but also allows a team without him to really splurge on defense.If you go without FPLs most expensive player you just have to make wise decisions and smart captain picks.

He was on the chopping block for me but then Coutinho and Aguero happened and then Redmond was giving me bigger headaches.Now Bellerin and Alonso are hot picks but price keeps climbing on Alonso and clean sheets and assists arent worth downgrading a midfielder at this point.,FantasyPL,db6das5,12,t5_2snvr

10175820,0,t3_5lmccr,My issue with City players other than Aguero in FPL is the amount of rotation they do ON the pitch. While KDB might be a key player in almost all of their attacks and is an incredible player he is often two or three passes away from the actual goal which means he doesnt get any points. They dont operate like other good attacking teams and have main midfield focal point for example most of Chelseas attacks flow through Hazard so you can cash in on at least some of their attacking potential with one player or Arsenal mostly revolving around Sanchez and Ozil. City dont have those one or two midfielders that are involved in the majority of goals.,FantasyPL,dbxhhge,1,t5_2snvr

10315390,0,t1_dcd8rrb,I think I prefer your current team because you have Sanchez and Hazard. You could downgrade Hazard to Coutinho Lallana Pogba etc. if you want to upgrade Benteke Capoue etc. You should try to avoid having to start Capoue or Allen every week. Stanislas Phillips or Zaha when he is back from AFCON are some great cheap midfielders you should try and upgrade Capoue to.

Im not saying there isnt a case to captain a Liverpool player Swansea are terrible at the moment and with Coutinho being back in the squad theres definitely a strong case for a captaincy pick but for me the fact of the matter is that Sanchez going quiet is still    point hauls each week he will be facing a Burnley side with absolutely awful terrible away form all season and to top that off Arsenal look like the most explosive team in the Premier league at the moment. Sure Lallana could pay off and I dont blame you for picking him but hes had his blanks in recent weeks so Id much rather pick a player who has been the most consistent point scorer in FPL this season against a low rank team.,FantasyPL,dcm0jpj,10,t5_2snvr

Yes.And if the OP doesnt have autism spectrum disorder or anything else which might affect language skills there is no excuse for writing in such a low informative way its just lazy andor self absorbed assuming everyone knows everything heshe does.I apologize to anyone with ASD or any other person who might feel offended by my possibly rude usage of the words autistic and Aspy.

Boruc on the other hand had an easy punch to make and made a complete hash of it. So while you can make a case that Alonsos throw was the main reason the ball got through to Costa its hard to argue that Borucs mistake wasnt the main reason the ball got through to McCauley.,FantasyPL,de7u4yu,4,t5_2snvr

11443433,0,t3_63ceg5, jumped on the WC bandwagon last night YOLO. This is not the time to focus on good defenders in my opinion because teams will be so aggressive to climb the table and defending teams will be shaky Arsenal Chelsea City Liverpool or injurys on main defenders united. Everyone is free picking manchester united defenders and I cant really see the benfits. Therefore in search for an better tactic I choose what I think is the best midfield and will produce the most points. Also we cant have all the best players that have DGW in GW  that team is set to be too expencive for the most of us.    ,FantasyPL,dft3pjy,1,t5_2snvr

BTW I am not sure if Pedro will be rested or not. There is Willian who can come in and cover for him on the weekend if he is tired. Are you sure you want to hold on to Firmino ?! Coutinho is sick ... Firmino without Mane and Cout might not perform as good as you expect him .. He is not in top form anyway. IF you really want Liverpool cover you can do Origi for Defoe too and then maybe upgrade Firmino to Alli ... At least Origi and Alli are both on top form !!! I think I just confused you more.
