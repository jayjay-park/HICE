Gravity add more points to your hero stats it start low it goes higher  completing  gravity training gives you special talent and completing further more add more talent which are op ! For example as i said low my Goku ss is now  on all stats But my Gotenks ghost which is on  gravity training  has over  on all stats ! If you do hell gate daily and reach up to  you earn a lot of zeni  you can do two drill everyday to at least be active there i guess it cost m for two try . Cards are important too but before all that Gears are more important after gears and gravity then do cards later ! I hope this help ,ZFightersApp,d6n1ezl,2,t5_3au4n
