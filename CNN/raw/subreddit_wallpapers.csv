The conversion to metric doesnt happen overnight it takes years. Besides its not necessary to switch over all tooling.  Canada for example is mostly metric except for hardware units and youd be hard pressed to find a Canadian under the age of  whod favour switching back.  Besides the US has already begun a shift towards using metric hardware.  Bicycles have been allmetric for quite a while now and US manufacturers are already adept at using metric hardware for the export market.  Its not that difficult to make the switch and Americans are not nearly as inflexible as you apparently think they are.,wallpapers,cgx83mi,-2,t5_2qhw4

He braced himself on the strut and asked me if I was ready. I said no he counted from  to  and jumped. We jumped out and barrel rolled to move away from the plane. For the first  seconds it was terrifying. After that you get used to the sensation. Once we stabilized I was able to use my hands to rotate in the air. ,wallpapers,cheirbq,2,t5_2qhw4

I think each guy in charge of the building added their own tower that was just a bit taller than the last guys and that is how it ended up being so peculiar looking.

After you drop to a preferred level which if youre just playing for the story quests isnt burdensome at all.Yes theres dumb quests like killing  bandits or whatever although with EXP boots purchasable with ingame credits I never found they were necessary for progression in the story quests.Sometimes the travel sucks... totally agree with you there.

While Shanghai is unique it does show that China isnt the insanely congested dirty clusterfuck that people imagine. Thats hongkong. The one thing that I love about this guys work is he really captures the light and color of shanghai. Its the most colorful city ive ever lived in and at night it really comes alive. Like New York and what not yeah stuff is going on but its NEVER dark in shanghai. There is either the sun or a trillion colorful lights comming off of all the buildings and roads. The elevated roadways are underlit with blue lights that run along the length of the road. It looks like that movie tron. The one thing i wish he captured more of but that he already did more than most is how green the city is! The government of shanghai takes its green initiative veeeryy seriously. There are trees planeted in all available space.,wallpapers,cyo4po9,3,t5_2qhw4

Heres the scene in question A large ship spoilers by the way lifts off with its engines to propel itself forward and escape atmosphere  but youll notice that before it flies out it stops and makes a rightturn to adjust its course. And thats all fine! But if youre paying attention to the background environment you might have also noticed that theres an enormous battle going on down in that field. Presumably hundreds of combatants human and Covenant alike. And those engines are positioned directly over it! That is a lot of intense heat and dust haha.
