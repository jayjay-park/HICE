8957009,0,t1_d7oh7ks,You know if you look closer at that pic it isnt even a piece of a Chevy grill at all is it? There should be a piece broke of that makes up the smaller squares and it doesnt appear that piece has that. In the top portion of the pic I drew where those pieces should be. In the bottom portion I drew the left square  where it shows the one piece is broken off but in the right square it doesnt seem to be broke where it should be if that was a Chevy grill.,RickyHcase,d7ohy6u,1,t5_3g0v9
8983698,0,t3_52x3ky,At the end of the day I really do wish that these guys know nothing about it and theres not a big coverup.  However hard to swallow that pill.Question on moving between borders Was illegal immigration from Mexico big in the s in this area or any chance we are talking Canada?  What were the rules for an illegal driving a car through the border?   Was it that simple?  I would have assumed that thered be no way an illegal immigrant could just drive out without paperwork.Add on top of that to drive out in a car that was in an accidentpotential homicide?  Id be so worried that a witness identified my car and Id be arrested.  No way Id try to drive through the border.To me it seems like a well never find this person cough cough so heres a scenario that will explain why wed never find them even if we dont believe this scenario is true at all.,RickyHcase,d7rpazm,1,t5_3g0v9
9004543,0,t1_d7u2fix,Exactly its completely ridiculous. Like you said theyre just saying its this way because I say so. IMO due to the really bad handling of that first collected evidence the pieces on the road are the real evidence. Also the tan paint chips that were found and the Manty squad cars that are tan colored is not a good look. O.o,RickyHcase,d7u7fei,2,t5_3g0v9

9063906,0,t3_5495ki,Great list.Given the time of the accident I would also have to believe this person was driving home from somewhere. What was open? We know about the party the bars in the area. Someone knows this fit a person and their vehicle. Unless the person left their home to drive to a open store or was traveling through very unlikely road for out of town person. It really seems like just finding the bar regulars and the party attendance would have really helped narrow it down. Cross it with your list of information you would have had back then and you would probably have your driver. Edit to add what bar would be appox the distance from am to the approx time RH was hit? Many bars close at am. Is that the case with the bars in that area? We know the paper delivery person may have seen RH walking and then later on the road. Gives us a pretty close time. ,RickyHcase,d81c2nd,2,t5_3g0v9
