Over halfway thought it right now its awesome. Just wish it was about x longer. But then that would mean Weezy woulda had to have more time so I guess not. ,lilwayne,d8tut8x,3,t5_2rtzk

I think its a pac remix actually Im a rider...actually Wayne seems to use the word donkey a few times also coming up in seat down low which also isnt a girls song and in that song he says .. ima get in that ass and act a donkey I suspect this is the song youre thinking of because I personally think its a better song...,lilwayne,dcrszlx,3,t5_2rtzk
