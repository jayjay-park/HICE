9006655,0,t1_d7ug6hd,Exactly.  At the small scale people dont want to be buying SAS controllers and drive enclosures just so that the can move from a drive RAID to a drive RAID to say nothing with what they end up doing with the  extra disks when theyre done.  mdadm also allows dynamically reshaping an array though it is less flexible about how space is allocated you end up having to micromanage partitions to create stripes across mismatched disks.,btrfs,d7ugja1,2,t5_2xikj
11777552,0,t1_dguzv2n,Sorry I didnt know your level of knowledge I was trying to lesson you on RAID but Im sure you even know more than me I was advising to use baremetal but I see you have it pretty figured out I didnt know you knew how to do passthrough... it could work I guess... pretty nice setup youve got too!!ECC Ram requires your motherboard and CPU to be compatible yes. As said For home use up to you importance of your data and your budget For seriour work and production environments A must.Did you even doubt there was an arch wiki about snapper ha!! DWhen creating partitions I always go with the typical setup Under the root of the btrfs two top level volumes root and home. Then another top level volume rootbackup. When starting I would boot up root the common convention is to call the active volumes XXXXs o the correct thing would be root I guess..... and snapshots are created under rootbackup. For home subvolume Its up to you If you want to recover deleted files I guess youll have to create the same setup I explained for the root fs... but be aware i guess you already know deleted files if they are on snapshots take space and you can see your btrfs partition running out of space pretty quickly.,btrfs,dgv0u1d,2,t5_2xikj
