He was only able to buy a gun that couldnt do that much damage at the time because the SPD had taken his guns at home into possession and he was on watch since the gun was bought by Dylan in Seattle itself. So he just did the deed with the best he could grab for himself with this particular kind of Remmington model and he shot himself up with that lethal dosage of heroin to ensure that he couldnt be resuscitated if he was ever found.

In our courts we can use circumstantial evidence to infer that a fact exists i.e. someone lied in their testimony where a person was at a given time etc. to convictYes when that circumstantial evidence is backed up by something more substantial than well why didnt they check the greenhouse man? No case is reinvestigated and nobody gets charged based on accusatory questions with answers based on nothing but assumptions and misinformation that fit a select narrative rather than the facts of the case.gtYou yourself labeled all of grants evidence and witness testimony as circumstantial evidence yet failing to realize that that can be sufficient to warrant a reinvestigation here in America.Evidently theres not enough in this case when it hasnt been reopened.

4790380,0,t1_ctybjno,Yeah I agree totally. Was going through a bunch of the photo archive the other night and there are several different types of Cobain looks that are a bit different. For example he looks quite different from late  to  when he cut his hair to mid  when he always had the facial hair goatee or whatever youd call it. I guess overall it is the hair either facial or head hair that can make him look extremely different. Also some angles or facial expressions made him look like a totally different guy especially when being goofy.

5186811,0,t1_cvb6n44,Although I would say that something either is iconic or isnt and that its difficult to set up a gradual scale for different degrees of being iconic I still think that two factors come into play time and therefore exposure. So the longer a song has been in contemporary consciousness the more claim for being iconic.This is why I think that because the most people living today from a certain generation are the baby boomers its their songs that are most likely iconic. Same than with politics the people most represented get to define cultural hierarchy also. And especially many younger people have being exposed to those ss songs Id say its relatively easy to say one of them would be most iconic. And since The Beatles was the most famous group at that time and still a household name Id say one of their songs would be the most iconic song. ,Nirvana,cvb78sa,2,t5_2qman

7749999,0,t1_d3ltxm7,I may be wrong but from what ive gathered from another board the seller and the person thats going to be sharing the songs are two different people.  The guy sharing worked with the guy selling to get a mix down of the tracks the guy sharing made the clips and said the guy selling wont let him share the full mix downs until next week and that the guy selling wont let him share the multitracks probably because hes trying to sell them.  If any of this is incorrect then I apologize Im just piecing together evidence Ive seen about this whole situation.  So it sounds like well get the full song mix downs by next week so theres really no need for a group collection to buy the tape. ,Nirvana,d3n48nu,1,t5_2qman

The lower the bit rate the more frequencies are cut off and narrowed down. FLACs lossless contain more or less all of the originalsource frequencies. Some peoples ears are better than others and some people have better sound equipment that results in some audible distortion which sort of sounds warbley kind of like the guitar chorus effect on Come as You Are or flangey guitar on Curmudgeon got to bring this back to Nirvana somehow haha. ,Nirvana,d44vg9o,1,t5_2qman

10517240,0,t1_dd010mx,One of my favorites also. This album in utero was the first Nirvana album I heard in its entirety and that line alone left me wanting to hear more.... which led to a seven year healthy? obsession over searching for and discovering every Kurt recording possible. That Unknown  that recently came out is great also.  I tried deciphering the lyrics in a past post and think I did a decent job if you want to check that out.,Nirvana,dd08qfi,1,t5_2qman
10521221,0,t1_dd0onf2,Well I mean to each their own indeed but I prefer to watch things as they were intended. There are only  genuine unique frames per second on film duplicatingfaking another  just makes things look weird and gives the soap opera effect to me it doesnt look right at all. Dont get me wrong for video true fps looks great nice and fluid but thats only when you have a source fps or  interlaced fields. Film is fps thats the correct way to watch it IMO. Film is supposed to look different to video. ,Nirvana,dd0ozvt,1,t5_2qman

11142131,0,t1_dete9lo,Uh what. In Heavier Than Heaven it says he had stomach issues from childhood just after his parents divorce. Suffered from malnutrition and had to get a barium xray but in the end they assumed it was stressrelated. His mother also suffered from an irritable stomach condition when she was younger. Eventually he was diagnosed with scoliosis which caused his spine to pinch a nerve in his stomach  Im sure his drug use gave him additional symptoms and it became a vicious cycle of needing more drugs to manage them. But he did not lie. ,Nirvana,deuy6q6,5,t5_2qman

You need to get over this rock n roll live fast die young bullshit because it is trash those that died at  including Kurt wasted their talent and their lives. Their is no glamour in wallowing in self pity or doing drugs and getting fucked up it is a waste of a life that can be great if you make the right choices. You dont need to do drugs to be a great musician the  club were all great despite the stupid decisions that they made. Focus on being the best of yourself and stop worrying about inane bullshit that doesnt matter life is whatever you make it.,Nirvana,df60crw,0,t5_2qman
