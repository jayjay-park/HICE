I would probably go sprint as well. Dont try and fight until you have boots and maybe ichival online. As long as you dont get snowballed early she shouldnt really have a chance late game. Good luck!,SmiteDuel,d7pkiff,1,t5_3fcnr

10740427,0,t1_ddnocvn,Lends itself as in it benefits snowbally gods who can use it effectively. Because you can so rapidly charge it on the wave you can use it to really enhance your bully potential.I would argue replacing either Gladiators Shield or Ichaival. Youre building as if you cant decide if you want to go abilitybased or basic attack and while its okay to transition from abilitybased to AA you generally dont do it so early. Id actually recommend replacing Ichaival for it you shouldnt be selling it for Exe lategame regardless because you already have Titans Bane. Only reason you would need double penetration is if they pick up double defense. The flat pen on Heartseeker and Crusher also benefit Titans Bane well. While you might be lacking on Attack Speed possibly Ninja Tabi could make this manageable. EDIT Gladiators Shield and Heartseeker early will really enhance your bully potentialtldr Starter Item  Ninja Tabi  Gladiators  Heartseeker  defense  Titans  sell starter for Crusher  Sell Gladiators for Qins Frostbound or FatalisFacing magical gods Id actually not pick up Heartseeker and focus more on being an AAbased god from the start. Their Warlocks Sash and potential Gem of Isolation lends themselves to getting messed up by Qins Sais and that high HP also makes abilitybased damage less effective.tldr Starter  Ninja Tabi  Silverbranch Bow  tier  Bulwark of Hope or Shoguns Kusari  Executioner  finish defense  FrostboundFatalis  sell starter for Crusher  sell Silverbranch for Qins,SmiteDuel,ddnslfn,1,t5_3fcnr

11283242,0,t1_dfawgdz,If he goes trans he has two options. Pen or defense. If he opts for defense you should go for defense as well. Defense counters power that has no pen. If he opts for pen he wont be too tanky but he is a warrior so he has base def. You should opt for early flat pen brawlers or divine into defense and get percentage pen after he finishes his defense item. If you can make it to late game as a hunter or someone top tier Fatalis gives you really good kite potential.,SmiteDuel,dfaxsy1,1,t5_3fcnr
