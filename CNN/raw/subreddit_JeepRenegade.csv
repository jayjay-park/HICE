8193369,0,t1_d4wgr7z,Just checked it out. it listed the  speakers as the base package and then for optional extras it says premium audio package which Im assuming is the  speaker upgrade that was a nice surprise for sure.  I saw  speakers mentioned and just assumed thats what it had but I believe you are correct that all s have the  speaker.,JeepRenegade,d51q14n,1,t5_36ttw
8500785,0,t3_4w5aih,Hey there I have the th anniversary with  inch wheels and the tire size is r. I personally like how the renegade looks a lot more with bigger wheels and tires. Theres way less of a gap between the tire and the wheel well which looks better to me. You wont really be able to go bigger with the tires than  if you go with  inch wheels. As for where to find good wheels and tires at the right price ebay or amazon!,JeepRenegade,d645fp9,2,t5_36ttw
8522487,0,t1_d66qhf8,The BFGs are much more aggressive and better offroad but they are heavy and may need a lift or spacers...I would check the forums for info.,JeepRenegade,d66vex5,2,t5_36ttw
8730842,0,t3_4zm7cc,Mine is fully loaded except for the lane sensor thing. I love the slush mats that come with the winter package. Mysky is a great feature I have not had any problems with it. Leather seats are great especially if you have a messy kid. Navigation is great although I dont use it much because of the phone nav I just enjoy the bigger touch screen. Definitely get a tow package they didnt have one available when I bought so I had to install the Renegade Ready kit its not too hard but I feel a hitch is a must for the Renegade I haul my bikes I also have a hitch basket and a small utility trailer for camping. I dont know I love all the extra features I dont think I would have bought anything lessbut it is our daily driver so I wanted to make sure it had all the creature comforts I could afford. ,JeepRenegade,d6x0154,2,t5_36ttw

9623773,0,t3_5csixp,My wife and I noticed a terrible smell in ours that kind of smelled like cat pee. Turns out something is leaking and the passenger rear floor is so soaked it started molding inside the car  Your issue may be different but if it sat for a year in the rain it may have had a similar fate and been cleaned up.,JeepRenegade,d9zbu8g,1,t5_36ttw

9967280,0,t3_5i6cxn,It may not apply to where you live but the Cold Weather Package is a fantastic option to have.I wish I had the rear center armrest. I think this is standard on the TH.The sun visors arent mounted to the roof very strongly. Dont handle them roughly.,JeepRenegade,db6rgzp,2,t5_36ttw
10108586,0,t3_5j9vyr,You need to replace the thermostat. P should not occur even at moderate sub zero temps.Thermostats are cheap. You can buy the thermostat alone for about  and install it in the existing housing... or you can buy the entire assembly for about . Theyre a cinch to replace if youve had some minor car repair experience. If youve did an oil change... you can replace a thermostat. Its usually even easier.Remote start is disabled when theres an active trouble code. Its a safety feature in not leaving a problem vehicle unattended.,JeepRenegade,dbp5rc1,1,t5_36ttw

10739706,0,t3_5sos7e,Easy way to determine if its the alternator.  turn car on disconnect battery If the car dies immediately that means your alternator is shot and pulling power solely from your battery.  ,JeepRenegade,ddnpx0u,1,t5_36ttw

11470878,0,t3_63n9w8,I think youre supposed to changed it a couple of times within the first few thousand miles while breaking in the engine. Also waiting for the change oil light to come on isnt best practice with any engine. I stick with the  Mile rule even with full synthetic. Better to be safe than sorry. ,JeepRenegade,dfw7vi6,1,t5_36ttw
