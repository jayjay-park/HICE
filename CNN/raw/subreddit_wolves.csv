28879,0,t3_1ufoho,Try Never Cry Wolf by Farley Mowat. It was written by a field biologist studying wolves in Canada about his experiences. Although some parts of the book were probably embellished in order to make a better story its a great read that gives you information on wolves while still being an interesting clever book.,wolves,cehpxnj,3,t5_2rwxn

3628842,0,t3_31xcn7,These wolves dont look particularly wild to me.  Judging by their behavior theyve almost certainly been around people quite a lot. Even discounting that they have no fear of humans like most wild wolves do their behavior seems more friendly than curious.While its possible that the people spent lots of time acclimating themselves with a wild wolf pack Im doubtful.  More likely I would guess that these are probably tame wolves living in a zoo or wildlife sanctuary.,wolves,cq5wz8x,16,t5_2rwxn
