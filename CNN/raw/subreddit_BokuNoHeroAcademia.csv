I think Bleach is a fun show if you watch it for what it is just plain awesome fights and cool characters. I really think Im just watching because I want to know what Spoilerss Ichigos new bankai is to see Aizen again and what his bankai is if he shows it and most importantly what is  my reason for still watching watching what happens with Kyoraku hes my favorite character and I still havent seen a bankai,BokuNoHeroAcademia,cowv8a2,1,t5_34a0h

Also I think in chapter  we might get a better understanding of Iida thoughts and his resolve towards his goal is it becoming a better hero? Is it ignoring everything his brother stood for and trying to kill stain? Or will he choose a different path entirely?

5297188,0,t1_cvm4g73,Im still giving Bakugou the benefit of a doubt. Hes a hot head who doesnt like working with others but his grades and trials so far show that hes far from being an idiot. Combine that with his flat refusal to accept Deku as a rival and you get an interesting possibility. Bakugou may have a plan for passing the trial and getting past All Might without fighting him straight on. Hell he could probably pull it off. He may have a plan that will let him pass while leaving Deku in his dust or better yet letting him save him. While everyone acknowledges his power Bakugou gets little credit for battle instinct despite how good he is at it. I think that burns him up a bit so he might be trying to do some all or nothing strategy that will let him get the recognition he thinks he deserves. The obvious problem is that Deku knows All Mights power way better than Bakugou and is gonna be clinging to him to try to get them both to pass.

7110102,0,t1_d1m9uke,Lots of details were simplified that made characters appear more generic. For example Momo is from a upper class family while the store is a discount chain. Normally someone from her economic standing wouldnt shop there. Eijirou suspects that she wanted to go into the store because its a rare opportunity for her to shop at a place like this and to see its inside.By omitting mentioning her wealth as well as the implied demographic of the store the MangaStream translation makes it sound like her reason to go shopping is just like any other typical girl.Immediately following that in the MangaStream translation Iida simply states that they have women with large breasts as if in awe of Momos new getup. In reality Iida is dressed as a butlerwaiter of a fancy storefront. He was practicing his line in a similar way to Deku but the Welcome to our store portion of the line was cut out by MangaStream making him sound like he is simply perving out when in reality he is practicing.Spinner also points out citizens criticizing losers who in all rights should be cheered on in the MangaStream translation when in reality he is specifically referring to heroes who lost. He was alluding to the fact that heroics have become part of capitalism and those heroes who cannot compete are shunned snuffed out when ideally a society that embraces the philosphy of heroism would have encouraged the loser to keep trying. This is an especially strong argument because in parallel to Spinners speech Eraserhead and the principal was being shunned by the public cases in point of Spinner saying heroes on the losing side are shunned. The MangaStream version leaves it too vague for this parallel to be apparent.Like I said they dont really affect the plot but they add flavor and I feel it would be wasting Koheis writing to leave them out of a translation.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,d1mb96s,17,t5_34a0h

Shigaraki watched Aizawa for a bit before he attacked to learn what he could do if it was the opposite Aizawa may have been able to counter if he know about Shigarakis quirk.  Hatsume knew exactly what was going to happen with Iida since she was the creator of the gear he used Izuku could be nonstrength quirk level strong but not superhuman through training.  If he didnt want to be a Hero that did things in the field he would have been exceptional I think as a Support tech at an HQ for a team of Heroes providing tactics and intel during the missions... or probably a Cop.

7720208,0,t1_d3joukg,Honestly I really began thinking about this watching the anime and reading this recent arc.Kirishima scored second in the entrance exam just below Bakugou and I thought how odd it was for a guy that is presumably THAT good to get into bottom five. Also the whole concerned thing in summer camp can be taken both ways since we didnt know what he was thinking in that scene itself. He could just be frustrated that the villains objective was leaked out so easily. There is also narrative factors as no other student from UA being a traitor would satisfy us or hurt us than kirishima.Also think about the whole rescue arc in another window Kirishima has just successfully baited the top  UA students Yaoyorozou and todoroki and midoriya who is a developing threat for AFO to the villains lair.Also the whole USJ arc he upfront commented on how villain like Bakugou was its just a theory for now. but the kanji puns that kohei is well known for had me convinced as the most damning point of evidence.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,d3jqgot,1,t5_34a0h

That scene from the latest episode of All Might talking to Deku about not revealing the One For All power and that the power can be transferred to other people especially people with bad intentions was what just got me a little bit concerned that potentially a major plot point of the series was the main villain attempting to get the power in the future. The villains were also introduced in this episode which made me think it could be going similar to Naruto BUT ONLY ON THAT ASPECT OF THE VILLAINS TRYING TO GET THE OVERPOWERED ABILITY FROM THE MAIN CHARACTER.

8520581,0,t1_d66lzaq,How about for quirks you have akin to  domains e.g. Fire water Air Earth Light Dark and Mind in a SHIZAM sort of scenario where you change physically also. While individually each quirk typically pales in comparison with other heroes with a similar quirk. The personality that comes with it is so well matched that it tends to be enough to push you over. e.g. Light is super excitable and that enthusiasm allows you to attack so relentlessly your opponent kind of gives up form exhaustion. Origin wise your mother had a shark quirk and in a very sinister turn you absorbed your  fraternal twins in the womb. So you have a psudo shark like appearance with some mostly vestigial gills and sharp teeth.  Costume wise youre stuck with something generic that can adapt to rapid changes in size temperature and what is currently being shot out of the gloves. Though the sides light up with different colours depending on what power you are using. ,BokuNoHeroAcademia,d66mtcq,3,t5_34a0h

8978394,0,t3_533yey,Peter Ette MSalem OregonBio  Born as an only child Peter grew up very isolated. With his parents constantly working and having no friends Peter spent most of his time indoors reading books and comics.  On occasion he would mess around with his quirk but he has never really bothered to go passed his current limits giving him great knowledge of his weaknesses and how to cover them up. Now as a high school freshmen hes set a goal to go beyond his limits and become a Pro Hero.Quirk Spin BallWith his fathers expansion quirk and his mothers rotation quirk Peter can expand his body almost like a balloon by taking a large inhale curl up become a human spin ball  inches in diameter and launch himself at his enemies. Hes also able to launch himself in any direction even upwards and can change direction. He can go for an extensive period of time in ball form if he likes due to his skin being more resistant than that of an average human its only drawback is that he cant see when in ball form so he only uses it for short bursts. Its almost like driving a car without any windows.Weakness Cramped Areas are an absolute nightmare if not downright impossible to maneuver in.Reason Being always indoors has caused Peter to have little to no life experiences causing him to view himself as unremarkable. Peter believes that the life of a hero is chock full of new experiences and that they are the most interesting people in the world. In short they are everything he isnt and everything he wants to be. Fighting StylePeter relies heavily on his quirk for combat being incredibly vulnerable when he cant use it though he can rely on his intellect in those dire times.StatsStrength Speed Intelligence Endurance Quirk StatsStrength Speed Intelligence Endurance ,BokuNoHeroAcademia,d7r2eb3,3,t5_34a0h

If you look at what ive said yes I do piss people off but the first comment in the chain is them saying somehting like this ship sucks or stop posting cancer. Your lucky im not sensitive or id be complaining about the cancer thing since my dad died of it. And the fact that people hate the ship make me right along with the fact that im breaking no rules in my posting. I honestly dont think anyone is the victim but if there is one its the guy who keeps having people tell him to fuck off and stuff. It would seem this rule was put into place to stop all the negative comments. As I have stated before yes I posted negative stuff but only in response to someone else negativity. And cant really prove this now but before the ban went up I had vowed to just ignore you guys from now on. the only time I brought up racism was when you paki was hating on people purly for likeing a ship.

As for the course if the viz translation is accurate it is a  month course. I think we should be in september now if the nd semester of the st year is about to start. That would probably suggest then that the course will take place in janfebmarch with the retake in april. So yeah weve got a few more months before todoroki and bakugou are out of the picture for a bit. However if they were attacked could they even fight back now? Probably not.

If he was my friend in real life Id break with him very soon and with no regrets.Bakugou doing things like a problem child and has almost no accomplishments to receive redemption from others and even further almost always he is the reason of the problem situation. Like how many times he helped others? And how many times he was being asshole? I also dont get why Japan people from comics dont do anything to him according to his attitude. In the real life this kid would be punished much and taught discipline.EDIT the only thing I see him continue doing things as undercover agent where he will have so much villains things around him that after the operation he will be softest and nicest person in the world.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,daf0tuu,3,t5_34a0h

I guessbut you specifically state that she is very caring of others yet she would be willing to inflict spinal wounds on opponents in what is essentially a primarily friendly bout?   It is still possible lol. The same way a nice caring person will go to war or whatever. I spinal injury wouldnt cause much discomfort better than other things. Amy is both faster and has more stamina than you  Where does this come from? I dont understand why you say this. Hizumi would be able to run as fast as humanly possible can go all out and not worry about injury and be as strong as humanly possible. She wouldnt have hulk level strength or anything obviously. Hizumis main idea is to store all of the pain caused by this to another part of her body hand finger etc. Exactly what kinds of wounds do you intend to inflict on each of the competitors? Really it depends. Whatever would technically end the match. If youre not eliminated for being paralyzed then I would just do something else that would count as being eliminated.

10074693,0,t1_dbfkb5y,Breaking your flow was my stab at guessing any hidden weaknesses you might have. As an exrhythm game player its pretty hard to recover from losing the rhythm before you fail.Rebuttal     Okay I admit I glossed over your mph speed because I use metric and didnt check how fast that was I thought it was like wallrunning in videogames. ms top speed is pretty darn fast.That said the point I made to say I could hit you wasnt that you didnt have the reflexes see it coming or anything. You absolutely can but at such high speeds you have a lot of inertia you need to overcome to turn. If you went headon at max speed a dodge attempt at max speed would make you go in a circle at best like this big arrow You cant just degree turn because you would need to be able to move at twice the max speed to do so one times to stop your forward movement and one times to go left or right. I will catch you in the blast radius even if the effect is minimal The orange glow the black circle is where it deals the highest damagepushing force which I admit you might be able to avoid. During the throw Ill also be preparing my next explosive to throw at your new trajectory and so on leaving you with no breathing space. If you approach closer during this it just means you have even less reaction time to turn and Im more likely to hit you. Despite your higher Quirk Speed  vs  which translates to your high top speed we actually tie in terms of physical speed  vs  which means my reaction times are as fast as yours.If you can get close enough to me Ill switch to creating a shield instead to prepare for your attack. You wont give me enough time to make my heatbased Reactive Armor to push you back so Ill do the opposite. Reactive Armor  Chill Maxwell creates a small system then expands it outwards to become a shield. When broken from the front both will get pulled towards the remaining walls but the more important effect is the chill that envelopes the attacker.Creating a small system then expanding it to medium takes less time than large to medium. The chill will definitely slow Flows movements down then with my other hand Ill prepare a pointblank heat burst to shoot with. If this doesnt incapacitate the recoil and my backpedaling should buy me some space and we can repeat the whole thing from the top again.Either during the oshit moment when you fly towards me or after the first chillburst combo when I have enough time Ill stuff the Shroom in my mouth. If I cant break your flow early then Ill just have to outlast you in this tango of you chasing me down while I get away to throw stuff at you and block your attacks.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,dbkr5y8,1,t5_34a0h

Also the animation the colors the cast and that amazing soundtrack hit a new level of excitement that the story cant have in the manga media.I usually prefer animations over comics but I will never stop reading My Hero Academia cause jesus christ Horikoshi is a fucking god.

10724893,0,t1_ddm06fg,Rebuttal Whew youre really tough. I can see what mastacoon meant when he said the judges deliberately put us in different teams. With that aside lets begin. I dont know if times up but reading your  rebuttals were really interesting and I just wanted to post something.Clarifying My TechniquesBurst Jump     Vitre didnt invent this technique on the spot its just that he never needed it in the previous rounds. Ive unveiled a bunch of techniques Torpedo Reactive Rifle Jump throughout the competition which were all designed beforehand. In fact Ive dropped hints for  of them and Burst Jump was hinted in  by the paragraph about Vitre having good control over his recoils which I quoted before I explained the technique. That being saidgtYou are better off forming a larger cuboid and standing on it.Ill give you this point. I probably could just make bridges out of my systems to cross roofs really. I just wanted to show off the technique. Rule of Cool and all that.Recoil    This goes back to developed resistance and being used to your quirk. Heat Burst is performed by Vitre holding the system in the palm of his hand and firing it straight. The system wont go flying out of control much like a gun doesnt jump out of a shooters hands after being fired. The technique has been written as his bread and butter attack from the very beginning of the competition so its not a stretch to say he knows how to handle the recoil.Torpedo Burst     What is this? Funny you should ask.gtThis means that target blasts will shoot the cuboid back like a rocketI linked a video of a pressurized gas tank firing off and breaking through a cinderblock wall when I first revealed the technique in  and again in my Rebuttal  against you. It is in fact me firing off a pressurized long system like a rocket by holding the length of it instead of the base and destroying the back wall of the system instead of the front like my Heat Bursts.Small PrepArceus already revealed and used the item it was salt.The GrabAiming for the legs of your golem with a Torpedo Burst if I dont know the weakpoint is not to trip it or anything Im aiming to break its leg off so it cant stand up again.The GoThe roof idea was because we felt your team couldnt match us in that mobility aspect. We could just run on ground level while you guys chase but with the buildings themselves as cover going by the roofs when you guys are chasing on ground level means its easier to shake you guys off.Off TopicgtOff topic but I do have a list of techniques using your quirk that would improve your damage potential mobility and defense that Ive been keeping to myself because we are enemies.Well you really piqued my curiosity with this. Could you share it with me after the whole competition is over? It sounds really interesting and Id love to know what you came up with.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,ddm6ygt,2,t5_34a0h

11060069,0,t1_delmex5,Some shitty cliffhanger? The ending with the introduction of AFO when All Might is about to tell him about it and the foreshadowing of the Vanguard Action Squad is one hype as hell cliffhanger ending to leave the fans wanting more.    If they adapt the series all the way from the beginning of the Sports Festival up to ending of the All Might vs AFO fight that would be the high point of the series. That would be the climax. Nobody would be getting any sort of hype or excitement for the next season starring the License Exam AKA the weakest arc of the entire series. That would just be a straight up horrible idea for business.    And not only that but you also have to factor in that if that much were to get animated in one season wed have to wait YEARS for a season  just for the manga to get further ahead of the anime and make enough content to adapt. And it would have to be enough content to live up the the standards of the previous season Which would be nearly impossible if season  had AFO vs OFA    The smartest thing to do in their situation is to realease season  covering the Sports Festival and Stain Arc and MAYBE the End of Terms Test Arc. Season  would definitely sell well.    Then you can give Season  the kidnapping of Bakugou and the Izuku vs Muscular fight AFO vs OFA and rescuing Bakugou etc. and so on and that would also sell really well. Because those two seasons would both have extremely good fan favorite arcs covered in each one. Which equals more money to be made. ,BokuNoHeroAcademia,deln2yt,1,t5_34a0h

11564620,0,t3_64y8li,Honestly I think her powers just make the person float. Theres a number of details the author either misses or chooses to ignore for creative reasons. A lot of the powers nearly all perhaps do things that dont necessarily make sense or arent well explained.I think its just an anime where the author can have fun just making up powers on a whim. I really dont think her powers personally are much deeper than  touched target floats.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,dg6usaf,1,t5_34a0h

11672592,0,t1_dgj0gs6,I dont agree with writing off Overhaul breaking down and rebuilding a terrified little girls body in some kind of way with the added implication it causes a lot of pain and to top it off possibly to his own daughter to farm her blood as isnt all that dark because something comparatively milder occurs more frequently? Im surprised you even consider Dekus injuries dark if you think whats happening to Eri isnt all that dark.Child abuse trumps selfinflicted injuries IMO. Introducing child abuse darkens a series tone irreversibly but not necessarily instadarkens it jet black. I think Todorokis past darkened BnHA but not to the point it lost its overall lighter feel. Just became less light than it started off as. I guess you could say that weve already dealt with the other explicitly dark event like Endeavours abusive ways so Overhauls shouldnt be surprising at all. After all I cant think of anything darker than those two things in the BnHA universe. I guess what we perceive as dark and how much so is subjective but its just bizarre to me that you can even use Dekus injuries as a comparison to Eris plight. No means of disrespect its just so far from what I agree with.EDIT Grammar.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,dgj3rtm,3,t5_34a0h

11679618,0,t3_66hlpp,A while back I was a little curious on a noninvisible Hagakure with the existence of a drug that Erases quirks that isnt like Aizawasenseis quirk. With the drug in full bloom I think the possibility of that might possibly happenhopefully not in a positive sense and we might see some quirk casualties along the way after the recent chapter.With an operation this big and Eris life on the line IWe can assume that some important people will be in the line of fire.

11746392,0,t1_dgrh2ft,Mentally incapacitated means like if hes unconscious suffered a serious concussion anything to halt or tampers with brain functionality will cause his telepathic control over Kumaku to halt or at the very least stagger based on how much damage is done.In this specific example hes not actually losing any brain functionality. If anything hes just turning into a crying shit show over his own personal issues that is overriding the sexual seduction nature of the challenge. This in turn causes him to subconsciously have Kumaku try to comfort him in an attempt to calm himself down. It however is not actually preventing him from continuing the challenge or the original command all thats happening is the subconscious reaction is tampering with the desired objective.Let me make it clear Hes doing a shitty job of dealing with the challenge even if he does get past it. I didnt do it for the sake of being a good way to get around the challenge I wanted to introduce flaw into the character himself. In this case he has a complex based on his physical appearance that was triggered by the illusions that Roxy was creating. This isnt something that would ever have prompted this reaction in the last challenge but Ive been keeping an eye for anything sexualsuggestivelove related to trigger this since I found out Bear Raid got accepted.The thing to remember is this is still a kid and hes trying to find his place in the world. At this age we all have things we worry about that are pretty stupid and this just happens to be one I felt would be an interesting character trait that would not normally surface in a competition like this. Furthermore its a very easy one for him to have as growing up all his friends are getting bigger and achieving a normal height while hes still a shrimp. Shit I made the poor thing shorter then Mineta and hes never going to get taller!Does this make my chances in the tournament better? Probably not! Hell if anything it may end up making me lose in the very end. But Id rather a character some actual character instead of being a bland I can handle anything! kind of person. The flaws are what make the characters interesting to me and I feel the character is better having this complex then if they didnt... in moderation of course Dtldr kids got problems.,BokuNoHeroAcademia,dgrheo9,2,t5_34a0h
