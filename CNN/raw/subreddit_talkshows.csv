4196233,0,t1_cryjqpu,I disagree actually  they were both quick on their feet which is why I love this clip but I thought Louis deconstruction of Lenos appearance was hilarious and went beyond the baldbeard gags.If anything its a clash of styles  Leno is quick with the one liners CK is going for something more conceptual.,talkshows,crykfkg,10,t5_2rg11

4799697,0,t3_3gmomw,I personally liked the desk monologue. Reminded me a lot of why I loved Seth on Weekend Update. It was longer hit on the same topic multiple times but still had its solid one liner monologue jokes youd expect.Im fine with the change because Seth needs to start breaking the mold. He does  desk bits a show now after the monologue and before the musical guest and now this. Id love to see him shake up the interview format and maybe go to one guest for longer and have a casual conversation. His interview skills were a big surprise from the start of his late night run. They need to cap on that. ,talkshows,ctzjhnt,13,t5_2rg11
5237011,0,t3_3mpe90,I hope people honestly give him a chance. An unfortunate sideeffect of our instantgratification culture is that we no longer seem to be able to let things grow. I think back to when Conan first went on the air and how he sucked for the  years. Yet he grew into the role and found his voice. That could never happen today.I look forward to seeing how Noah hosts the show. Since he is not American I believe that really gives him a good platform to observe the absurdity that is the American political system and provide an outside voice that seems to be sorely missed in side America.,talkshows,cvh907b,14,t5_2rg11
5270487,0,t1_cvkeoiu,Itll be interesting to see how it works out for Seth Meyers. Hosting Late Night theres always the possibility of being promoted to the Tonight Show. But presenting himself as a political comedian might hurt Seths chance at the job plus its possible that Jimmy Fallon could be hosting the Tonight Show for the next two or three decades. So whats the ideal job for a political comedian? Comedy Central? Like you said thats kind of a step down in prestige from NBC. HBO? Actually I could totally see Seth replacing Bill Mahr like five years from now but thats still probably going to be a smaller audience than he has at NBC. But maybe not anything could happen in the age of streaming. I think Seth is great and Id love to see him insert himself into the political conversation like Jon Stewart did. ,talkshows,cvld3z7,2,t5_2rg11
5348427,0,t1_cvv4h7c,Because they apparently are just like staunch republicans in this country who align with a base and thats it. Now I will not say they do not follow politics but as the other side they see things through their own perspective and following a political ideal is better suited for them they think in this fashion.,talkshows,cvvblmu,1,t5_2rg11
