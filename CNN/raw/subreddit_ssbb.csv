3362334,0,t3_2ymbad,NO. No character should be banned. Meta Knight while somewhat overpowered is still beatable. Why dont we leave it at top tier.,ssbb,cpbj4q6,3,t5_2rb3z

3896705,0,t1_cr0f0i7,Why did you not mention Big Blue in that list? And Pictochat is fun but its a bit too stagehazardey for me. And whats wrong with Brawls FD? Theyre all basically the same,ssbb,cr0gin0,1,t5_2rb3z

4835052,0,t1_cu3vh5u, stock makes the game run faster and basically eliminates planking since there is never a stock lead. I like three stock more but I think its not going to draw players in. If we want to grow the scene I think we need to discuss ruleset changes that will bring in more players from other games. When people think of three stock brawl they think of planking and timeouts but one stock seems much faster and so appeals to newer players while keeping brawls mechanics and play styles.,ssbb,cu3zwly,1,t5_2rb3z
5279069,0,t3_3nawq1,for a couple characters it might be usable. I dont know brawl sheiks hitboxes off the top of my head but her dash attack doesnt actually have any range really. when looking for a dash attack it is viable on look for one that covers below you as it lets you cover the edge with it. usually better options though. someone here probably knows better than me though,ssbb,cvmgn90,1,t5_2rb3z
5501102,0,t1_cwes0p3,Ya man its tough. I honestly like having MK and ICs because I truly believe they are beatable. Like jesus people say MK is literally the most OP character in every video game... but Ally won Apex  even if the other players were rusty how OP can MK really be?,ssbb,cwetfuc,7,t5_2rb3z
