861836,0,t3_23zx8m,oh man I really feel your pain. I grew up there and pretty much everything sucks.However if you arent into hiking now would be a great time to pick it up.   You can climb Bell mountain.  There is also a short hike right when you cross from victorville into apple valley. Its not steep but a nice little climb. Just follow the frontage road and find a place to hike. Wrightwood has some good places. Inspiration point has some trails close by. If you go a few miles past that there are even more. Devils punch bowl. search it online and go. There is a short loop and a . mile loop plus lots of fun rocks to climb that dont require much skill. The cajon pass those big ass rocks you pass... get off the  go right then look for a place to pull off the side of the road. there should be a place to drive completely off the road. Really cool.For dinner... Id rather do chipotle innout or something that is not a sit down. theres tons of average places to eat. Focus on an activity its much better for getting to know someone. You could do jamba juice on your way to the hike as well.good luck!   ,InlandEmpire,ch28vg5,2,t5_2rjtz

4748327,0,t3_3fxdek,Welcome to the neighborhood. Redlands will depend. Traffic sucks everywhere in So Cal. A  minute drive could be  miles or  depending on which direction youre headed. From Redlands Id say the Ontario Rancho Cucamonga area would be the best bet to a  minute commute during the rush hour times. Riverside would be good too. Corona maybe as well. Thats if you have to head in the western directions. There isnt too much east of Redlands which is why youll have an easier time going that way. Yucaipa Banning and Beaumont are all fairly small cities with mostly retail stuff likely available. Palm Springs isnt that much farther but jobs will be service retail or casino most likely.Jobs in the Ontario And Rancho Area can range from warehouse to office. Same with Riverside and maybe Corona. Out east youre looking at either a Casino job or retail like I said.  Id check Google California Jobs or something to see if you can find a site similar to what you have up in Seattle or Monster or something. If youre interested in warehouse work let me know I can look into a few of the places I know hire quite frequently.Regarding the license I believe CA law states you have to surrender your old license within ten days of taking residence in the state. They straight up steal your old license from what Ive heard. They dont want you handing it off to someone or something. Car registration is about the same. Might be  days to register but I see people get away with it some how for much longer. I dont think it Will keep you from getting called back but Id jump on it pretty quick.
