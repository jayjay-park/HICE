5447481,0,t3_3p802q,I like the style but I think that different locations are going to be key in the long term playability. the desert theme shown here is really cool and I think some cactuses and stuff would work well but I think a few things could help mainly some sort or road wether it be a desert dirt road or an actual highway over a futuristic cityscape with moving obstacles. Oooooh and different vehicles shapes and sizes and colors.For Instance some ideasDesert dirt road texture cacti maybe a midwest truck stop rest stop like buildinggeneral storeSmall Town simple road main street shops intersections wcross trafficFuture town big city Highway or air highway flying vehicles spinning helicopter type building parts in the way of flowing cars towards finish maybe consider having the finish not be straight ahead of start and have to jump onto cross traffic to change direction all locationsAnyways the game looks awesome cant wait for the alpha!,HighwayFightSquad,cw7yvff,1,t5_39ima

6484836,0,t1_czpmde5,gtThe level with the long corridor of moving lasers isnt very satisfying to me. It might be because I cant easily track them  red on red is hard to discern and they dont leave any indication of where they travel.Honestly if they dropped the red aesthetic and went with a darker blue itd be way easier.
