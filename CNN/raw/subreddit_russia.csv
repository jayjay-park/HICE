458222,0,t1_cfs4jei,Again thanks for answering though I cannot follow most of your arguments.Yes antirussian sentiments and nationalism played a role in the uprising that is an objective fact. But how much it really played a role and is supported by the whole population and the interim government is not so clear. What I called FUD are the claims that say all of the population in the west consist of nationalists and russiophobes only and that nationalists and fascists are in control of the state and the only forces running the interim government. How much nationalists really are supported by the population would have been clarified by the elections in May. However you can be sure that now with the intervention of Russia and threads of war all the remaining ordinary people will also become nationalists and russophobes. Thank you Putin.The other thing I cannot understand is the downplaying of the amount of corruption in the former government and the wealth accumulated by the president and his cronies like the prosecutor general. Russians seem to consider this pretty normal and just mock their bad taste or compare their extreme wealth with the even more extreme wealth of some Russian oligarchs. However what I understood from talks with Ukrainians they do consider corruption and the inequal distribution of the goods in their country a problem and they long for a state where such things are not considered normal. Thats why they tend into the direction of Europe not Russia.Of course how the government dealt with the initially peaceful protesters mostly students who were beaten up brutally infuriated even more Ukrainians who joined the protests. When these second wave of protesters were tortured or killed by anti riot police and shot by snipers this was the finaly straw. Yanucovich and his regime lost any legitimacy. He is not just shitty. Why dont you see this?And why do you think people with automatic weapons who refuse to give them up and intimidate government officials are any better when they are Russians? Isnt this exactly what the prorussian forces are doing in Crimea? Why always these doublestandards?You say the problem of antisemitism nationalism and opression of minorities in your own country and its history exists but is not nearly on the same scale as in the Ukraine. My point was that the scale of the problem in the Ukraine was inflated by Russian media while the scale of the problem inside Russia is downplayed. However it will be difficult to ever find out how large the scale of the problem really was when the intervention of Russian into the inner affairs of the Ukraine will now cause the scale of the problem to explode.,russia,cfscksw,0,t5_2qh75

Even if the Tatars who hate Russians for a good reason wouldnt vote. Its very unrealistic and can happen only trough cheating. Especially if on other occasions it was always close to  or  .Call the fish by the name. Putin wanted it and used the situation. If you believe otherwise youre making up excuses and close your eyes from reality. No not everything the US does is justified and right. Not everything other countries do is justified and right. Russia drew often enough the short stick. But this isnt right. And nothing will ever make it right.Because the reasons behind it was hunger for power and not a genuine interest to help people. And if this world has enough of something its greed and power hunger.If the US is trying to help another country  and just blows all its money out for nothing  then there is at least an open discussion about it with many US citizen who demonstrate and look for alternative solutions and call it not right.

I suspect like most Russians you only know of a coup in the colliquel medieval sense where a monarch is assassinated by someone in line for the throne.  While this is a coup its not a coup for the reasons you mentioned. Its a coup because its an armed attack against key figures of the state in order to remove them from power and replace the body of the state. Monarchy like dictatorships understanding of regime in the modern era comes from Louis the ths famous proclamation I am the state the Diving Right of Kings and the fact that an autocrat is the bound of his or her autocratic regime. Just because a dictator or monarch is overthrown and a new dictator or monarch take his place and they dont actually change power structures doesnt mean its not a regime change an autocracys implementation is bound to the autocrat.

They wanted to be part of Germany too its why they called themselves the Republic of GermanAustria.You would discount any analogy because its not the exact same event. The point of the analogy isnt to be identical. The point is to be analogous.In this case this is analogous a dictator invades another country under the pretext of protecting people it claims to be the nationstate for stages a referendum run by either them or people very highly sympathetic to them wins a referendum and then quickly annexes the country.Are there differences?

989942,0,t1_chgs95j,Thanks for your really well balanced response I appreciate it.Your comments about the government and political system make sense. Im glad to have heard your opinion about this especially. What I can understand is that conservative views are generally held by the older generations and in the UK where I am those groups of people are the ones that take great pride in voting whilst younger generations show a degree of apathy. The conservative values in this country are out of date too just like in Russia  its just that the Conservative government have no choice but to roll with change as the people seem to be confronting the issues headon and en masse by way of protests marches and events like Gay Pride the right to choose etc. To do otherwise would make them appear oldfashioned to a younger generation which is the same generation they will rely upon for votes and support later if they wish to stay in Politics. There simply isnt enough of the old guard left for pure rightwing parties to survive in my opinion an opinion which may well be under informed.Your comments about Conchita Wurst are very welcome too. You have to remember that where I am all I am exposed to is a reduced and simplified polarised view  the Deputy PMs comments for example or the Twitter users shaving off their beards in protest. Its comforting to know that the general view is not as narrow as this.As for the people saying Fuck Russia Im afraid I hear it all the time. It all got pretty intense during Sochi for reasons too obvious to point out which isnt to say I agreed with the responses I heard then and had myself or do now. I think that the idea that Putin represents the populist vote in Russia taints the view of the nation in general. Again thats not to say the outsider view is right. I think theres a general disdain at Putin from the outside which is a mixture of frustration and anger due to Russia being such a huge country that appears to be moving slowly relative to other nations. The fact there are other ideas even if they arent close to fruition is definitely a boon. I can see that time will help in a lot of respects as along as a majority of the next generation of voters doesnt adopt the conservative views of those that came before them.I know that there will be a lot of Russians that would be more than happy to have a discussion like this in an open and frank way and I just wish it happened more in the public domain in a way that more people would be exposed to it.I am really glad to have read your response and Im thankful you took the time to reply. ,russia,chgtaps,8,t5_2qh75

The first started as a civil war with a proMoscow faction fighting against a proIndependence faction. Then federal troops rolled in and it became everyone vs the Russians. That ended in  with federal troops rolling out and Chechens going back to what they were doing before the troops rolled in trying to decide whos boss.One small but rather radical faction decided that they deserved to be boss more than anyone else and that hardcore Islamism fueled with Arabian and Turkish money is just the thing to get them the bossingness they deserved. The actual bosses whove been bossing the place since the Flood decided that enough is probably enough and when federal troops rolled back in major factions immediately joined up with them.

1237133,0,t3_288pbd, How would I go about opening a bank account? I work at one in the U.S. and foreigners without a U.S. mailing address if Canadian or without permanent residence cant open one. I dont want to pay my banks  exchange fee every time I use my mastercard. Arrive in the city. Register. Your hotel can do that or your landlord can give you a document to take to the post office or your employer can help you or you can use a service. Once registered you will get a slip of paper with your registration details. That and a passport is all you need to open an account.Do many places and small shops accept MasterCard or is everything mostly cash only?Big shops and restaurants take Visa and MC small ones might not and sometimes a restaurant might just not be accepting them that day. Taxis also may not. I typically carry a lot more cash in my wallet in Russia than in the US.What can I expect from street vendors food wise in Saint Petersburg?Street vendors? Ermm. Shawarma shashlik baked goods? Russia is not a major street food country. Fortunately there are many other places to eat including cheap little places if thats what you want. I recommend checking our GeorgianCaucasian and Uzbek cuisine in addition to Russian  there are lots of cheap and tasty restaurants that serve those. Is it easy for a foreign national to rent a car? I lived in the Balkans briefly and renting vehicles was extremely difficult.For how long? There are the standard car rental companies for short trips If you want to rent a car for a year you will have to talk to car leasing companies. They typically work with corporate clients in my experience. You can also go to one of the many car services that provide a car and driver on a monthly basis. However public transportation is pretty good in Saint Petersburg. You mention making money on the side so I guess you arent that wealthy  you may find that no car is needed at all and you can save money that way. Should I expect a different atmosphere when it comes to interacting with women or are women genuinely open to English speaking men approaching them?It depends on the woman. You will find some interested in you because you are a foreigner but be careful  they are more interested in that foreign status and your perceived wealth than you. There also lots of nice girls  try and find one that is educated and speaks English and that otherwise is compatible with you. Be aware that most of the time you will be expected to pay for things carry bags give flowers etc.My school told me I could teach English for extra money. Is this as easy and realistic as my school has made it seem? What would one expect to earn per hour doing so?Dont know. There does appear to be strong demand especially you have a certificate in teaching English as a second language but its not my field.During wintertime where do most Russians congregate? For Americans we tend to head south to Florida and the Caribbean and I noticed there were a lot of English tourists who went south to Croatia and such.Warm places they can go without visa headaches  Turkey Egypt Thailand Israel. Those with the resources go further afield  Miami the Maldives UAE etcHow different is the nightlife between summer and winter is there much drop off?There is a real difference in my experience Ive never been in SPB in January but I have been there in March and in the summer  White Nights are a fun time with people up and out and feeling energetic. In the winter it is cold and dark and while there is most certainly night life the summer atmosphere is more fun.What are some dos and donts when it comes to conversation topics. In the U.S. it is generally frowned upon to talk about politics  which I dont. Ironically I may field questions considering I am studying politics. Are there specific historical events I should I not talk about if a conversation arises?Play it by ear but be careful  Russians understandably will be touchier about outsiders criticizing Russia than when they do it themselves much like how you can complain about your Mom but I cant  I dont love her like you do. Russians also are basing their understanding on different information sources  their beliefs about what is happening may differ significantly from yours. Do I have to pay for water if I ask for it in a restaurant?Yes because it will be bottled water dont drink the tap water at home either. Buy it. You can get it in liter bottles or set up a delivery service.Are there any taboos that I would be unaware of? What are some touristy things unique to Russia that I should avoid doing so I dont piss off locals?Saint Petersburg is a very touristy place  it is the Russian city in which people are most likely to be used to foreigners and their foreign ways .The standard ones are dont whistle inside dont stand on thresholds shake hands more smile less smile when you are genuinely happy not as what may be perceived as insincere goofy grinning. Big one  make an effort to learn Russian. You dont have to be Pushkin but at the very least learn the very basics to get around. People appreciate that you make the effort and dont just expect them to learn your language in their country. It will make your life easier too  even in touristy Petersburg there are a lot of people who dont speak English.What are some other things that I should be aware of?I mentioned this elsewhere but if you are a US citizen the US Embassy and possibly consulate in SPB will give you a second passport. Many other countries will do this too. The official reason is so that you can travel on one while submitting the other for visas. I suggest doing this  that way you can store your main one somewhere safe and still have the other one to use as an ID passport is the most common from of ID in Russia and you may find that you need it in unexpected places such as to enter certain office buildings. It also is genuinely convenient to have multiple passports for the aforementioned visa reasons.Petersburg is a unique city. So is Moscow although it is different from Petersburg.

This is lower than the whole worlds ratio and a lot of countries have higher ratios. Not only that but these ratios dont correlate with  the economical cituations.

1520858,1,t1_cj6u3yg,I dont suppose that you know how widespread Ukrainian nationalism is and what their beliefs are do you? Well let me enlighten you.According to their dogma Ukrainians are genetically and culturally superior to us Russians or Muscovites as they prefer to call us because they are the true genetically pure Slavs while our blood is hopelessly polluted with FinnoUgrich Tatar and other Asiatic genes which supposedly makes us dumber less civilized and more violent. They are the true successors of the Kievan Rus while we are a bunch of mongrels created by the Golden Horde. Lacking any genetic evidence to support this they like to point out things like the various words that Russian language borrowed from the Tatar one such as bogatyr warrior. Ive had a Ukrainian nationalists explain it all to me claiming that we owe them our civilization  that it all started with Kiev which is much older than Moscow blah blah blah. When I pointed out that the roots of the Kievan Rus have actually been traced back to Northern Russia and Novgorod and that it is from Novgorod that Prince Oleg set out to conquer Kiev from the Khazars selecting it as his new capital due to it being located on important river trade routes the Ukrainian nationalists mind was blown and after he recovered he told me that it all must be just Muscovite lies. In reality the vast majority of historians agree on the NovgorodOleg thing. Moscow was an insignificant town during the height of Kievan Rus power and wasnt developed into a city until much later but it was located in the wealthy and important VladimirSuzdal Principality. In fact most of Kievan Rus was located in modern day Russia.However Ukrainian nationalist like to go back in time further than even medieval history. They took the Kurgan Theory and ran with it now believing that Ukraine birthed the entire European Civilization thus making them the  original most pure Europeans.

1619592,0,t3_2cv1vm,From my Western point of view its a bit of a mixed bag.On the one hand we get to hear every now and then on the Dutch television that Putin is playing a double game. His ratings were pretty low a few years ago and he tried to counter that by doing what he knows makes him popular Being a strong dependable leader. For that he needs a little bit of unrest to act up against and while nothing is even  Putins work obviously we do get to hear he has a hand in conflicts surrounding Russia. As you can see in the polls and if I look around on the this subreddit I get the feeling this seemed to have worked. He has won crucial support and time to achieve his bigger ambitions which I no doubt believe to be grand and in good spirits for Russia. To add Ive heard some more laws were passed that are of populist nature.However the unrest he wanted to act up against have gotten him between a rock and hard place.These actions have conflicted the Russian well being in two important ways. Before the conflicts when his rating was lower he was doing an amazing job on pulling the strings between European countries. He saw that the EU is not a country with a national feeling and that they would easily prefer to achieve personal advancement then to collaborate. This kept the EU politically weak and divided but the relations between a single nation and Russia were pretty good. However in the rise of recent conflicts his actions were more and more not EU creating pressure on the relations. It was nothing he couldnt handle since the relations were cemented in large sums of money.Everything changed with MH. The USA jumped right in to tell big stories. Two of Russias best relations to control the EU were hit the Netherlands and Germany. The EU finally got their balls together concluded that Russias game had to come to an end and went to make their first big decision in their first external conflict ever. For the first time ever the EU was slightly an us. That in itself is a major political loss for Putin and he saw his clever grip on the EU in which Russia arguably has been seen as one of the  big players maybe even the biggest fade away in days.Now the conflicts are pointless but hes still in twilight. Of course he doesnt want to invade Ukraine war is expensive and the image damage in the rest of the world would never heal until hes gone. However the stories being told on national TV has turned against him with internal pressure growing to do something. Combined with the sudden frustration of all his plans being fumbled by some mistake of some soldier somewhere in the Ukraineas far as Western media is concerned he has lost his cool a little and wants to act on his ambitions one way or another. Avos.On China we all know China is way too big both demographic historically and economical for Russia to be of real influence. the EU as long as its divided is manageable and easy to influence. China will probably think any attempt of Russia to get its way on grey territory is cute at best. Its not the rich partner Putin and Russia are looking for to once again be a top player.EDIT horrible spelling,russia,cjjbdbp,9,t5_2qh75

But theres zero accountability for its own actions of actually fueling the conflict.  The western media also has these reports.

Nation  a single organism solidarity  that is what strengthens the unity of the members of one national community.  In time of need       it support your fellow Ukrainian. If you encounter hostile attitude towards you you know that it is in most cases due to incriminating behavior of your fellow countrymen. In addition to decent people of Donbass goes much cattle and it compromises his region rednecks. Your example show that residents of Donbass  a sincere open disciplined and hardworking people who love Ukraine and ready to work for the benefit. Once on a new location just try to find a job and become selfsufficient not to be a burden to the community. Grudge not if you found work and housing will be worse than the ones you had before. The cause of all your suffering is Imperial Moscow and its henchmen in Ukraine. Able   men    should  construct    volunteer battalions of the National Guard or Armed Forces of Ukraine. Your duty  protecting not only Ukraine but  also your land which is now being trampled by boots of the Moscow occupier. Those who shy away from this duty shall be reduced in rights and covered with shame.    Master the Ukrainian language history and culture. Back to the Basin you must be a native of the national revival of the region. Inform your relatives and friends who remained in the Donbas the realities of life in the free areas. Destroy Moscow propaganda lie! Identify the midst of refugees enemy spies and saboteurs. Inform the representatives of the right sector and SBU. So you actually speed up the return home.In addition to respectable citizens fleeing Moscow aggressors we call upon cattle degenerates traitors! If you are not a Ukrainian patriot the locals    will explain that your beliefs are wrong. Do not rely on the police  it will not help you and will not save you from just retribution. Last month respectable Ukrainian citizens eliminated not one supporter of the NPT. By talking to antiUkrainian resuscitation departed ten traitors. If you saboteur you will soon be exposed and you shall bear the deserved punishment. Better voluntarily surrender to SBU. Thus in close cooperation with the investigation and effective repentance you can avoid punishment. If you are expectant widow  wife of a terrorist DNR or FSC  note the following. We are not at war against women and children. But knowing that what your husband is doing people who around you will do everything necessary to make your life turned into hell. Persuade your husbands to give up and with their blood and sweat to wash their own shame and crimes against the Ukrainian people.

2620188,0,t3_2pwg6f,Free Fall of the Ruble Whos Behind it? A Ploy of Russias Economic Wizards? Whose Chess Game?By Peter KoenigGlobal Research December  Region Asia Russia and FSUTheme Global EconomyThe world is still hellbent for hydrocarbonbased energy. Russia is one of the worlds largest producer of energy. Russia has recently announced that in the future she will no longer trade energy in US dollars but in rubles and currencies of the trading partners. In fact this rule will apply to all trading. Russia and China are detaching their economies from that of the western financial system. To confirm this decision in July   Russias Gazprom concluded a  billion gas deal with China and in November this year they signed an additional slightly smaller contract  all to be denominated in rubles and renminbi.The remaining BRICS  Brazil India and South Africa  plus the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO  China Russia Kazakhstan Tajikistan Kirgizstan Uzbekistan and considered for membership since September  are also India Pakistan Afghanistan Iran and Mongolia with Turkey also waiting in the wings  will also trade in their local currencies detached from the dollarbased western casino scheme. A host of other nations increasingly weary of the decay of the western financial system which they are locked into are just waiting for a new monetary scheme to emerge. So far their governments may have been afraid of the emperors wrath  but gradually they are seeing the light. They are sensing the sham and weakness behind Obamas boisterous noise. They dont want to be sucked into the black hole when the casino goes down the drain.To punish Russia for Ukraine Obama is about to sign into law major new sanctions against Russia following Congresss unanimous passing of a recent motion to this effect.  That is what the MSM would like you to believe. It is amazing that ten months after the Washington instigated Maidan slaughter and coup where a Washington selected Nazi Government was put in place the MSM still lies high about the origins of this government and the massacres it is committing in the eastern Ukraine Donbass area.Congresss unanimity  what Congress and what unanimity?  Out of  lawmakers only  were present for the vote  The others may have already taken off for their yearend recess or simply were ashamed or rather afraid to object to the bill. As a matter of fact of the three who were present to vote two at first objected. Only after a bit of armtwisting and what not they were willing to say yes. This is how the unanimous vote came to be as trumpeted by the MSM  unanimous by three votes! The public at large is duped again into believing what is not.What new sanctions does this repeatedly propagated bill entail?  It addresses mostly Russian energy companies and the defense industry with regard to sales to Syria as well more antiRussia propaganda and democratization programs in Ukraine  and Russia all countries with the objective for regime change.How do these sanctions affect Russia especially since all Russian energy sales are no longer dollar denominated?  Sheer propaganda. The naked emperor once more is calling an unsubstantiated bluff. To show his western stooges who is in power. Its an ever weaker showoff.Now  as a consequence of declining oil prices and of western sanctions  of course what else?  Russias economy is suffering and the ruble is in free fall. Since the beginning of the year it lost about  last week alone . As a result and after serious consideration says MSM the Russian Central Bank decided a few days ago to increase the interest of reference from . to  to make the ruble more attractive for foreign investors. It worked only for a few hours. Raising the interbank interest was Putins reply to Obamas bluff  feeding at the same time western illusion about Russias decline.The propaganda drums tell you Russia is helpless because the world has lost the last bit of confidence in President Putin  of course. Regime change is on the agenda. Mr. Putin must be blamed as the culprit hoping to discredit him with his people. He is leading Russia into a deep recession the worst since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The mainstream media show you interviews with average mainstreet Russians saying they have lost all their savings their salaries and pensions are worth nothing anymore and they dont know how to survive this coming calamity.In reality at least  of the Russian population stands solidly behind Vladimir Putin. He has brought them universal education health care and fixed infrastructure that was decaying after the fall of the Soviet Union. President Putin is literally revered as a hero by the vast majority of Russians  including the countrys oligarchy.In fact nobody in the western economic system these days is dealing in rubles. In shortsighted connivance with Washington the treasuries of the western vassals are releasing their ruble reserves  which Russia does not buy thereby flooding the market. Russia not only has large dollar reserves plus the ruble is backed by gold a fact consistently omitted in the MSM. For now Russia prefers to let the ruble plummet.Under another arrangement by bully Obama Middle Eastern oil producing puppets like Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States are overproducing and flooding the market with petrol and gas thereby driving the price down to the ostensible detriment of Russia and Venezuela both countries where Washington  vies for regime change. A double whammy thinks Washington buying kudos with the stooges. The sheiks that control their energy output apparently have been promised enough goodies from Washington to bite the bullet and take their own losses.Russia needs rubles. Thats her currency. That is the currency Russia needs for future trading  detached from the western monetary system.When Russia deems that her currency has reached rockbottom she will buy back cheap rubles in the market with massive amounts of dollars. Russia may then flood the western market  with dollars euros and other westernallied currencies  and gold.  Lets not forget the ruble is backed by gold. By now we know what flooding a market with currencies may do to these currencies  and simultaneously buy back rubles from the West.  A brilliant move to reestablish Russias currency in a new emerging monetary system  which Europe would be welcome to join but willingly no by Washington style armtwisting.Surely Russia is not interested to cause the sudden destruction of the dollarlinked financial world. She is not interested in a sudden death of the many countries that are potential new trading partners in a new monetary system. Instead the fall of the western economy of deceit may be planned as a gradual slide so that countries have time to switch  switch their reserves to rubles yuans and other BRICS and SCO currencies. This move is on its way. Only ten years ago dollar denominated securities constituted  of reserves worldwide. Today the rate is  and declining.After all perhaps as Plan B there is also a pact of monetary alliance between Russia and China. China holds currently about . trillion dollars and in total more than  trillion dollar equivalent in western currencies  and undefined but huge gold reserves. Chinese BRICS and SCO solidarity with Russia is a solid security for the ruble. Imagine  the first major action of the new BRICS Development Bank with a current capital base of  billion dollars would launch a massive ruble rescue operation. No worries Russias economy is on firm course.The question begs  is this gigantic engineered ruble devaluation scheme another precursor to war? A nuclear confrontation or Cold War II?  Precursor to another western Washingtondriven false flag attempting Moscow to fall into a lethal trap?  Not necessarily. Russia is playing a clever chess game diplomacy at its best. Instead of sabre rattling  Russia is coin rattling. It might lead to a western financial fiasco early in  for the dollar and euro denominated economies.

No we will not forgive the nazis nor will we forgive the soviets simple as that. There is a significant difference between the two but youre basically telling us that the atrocities committed can be quantifiable and thus can be ranked by numbers. More people died under the Soviet Union than the nazis disregarding the bonechilling deathfactory style the nazis had. Where do we go from here? I will never be grateful to the soviets for what they did. Yes they did carry the brunt of the war and played an incredible role in defeating the nazis but thats only because they were backstabbed.

People are saying that sites are getting blocked Twitter accounts are getting blocked etc.As of what I saw yes they indeed are getting blocked but if were only talking about propaganda sites. I mean you wont get blocked for criticizing Putin or the government.You can however get blocked for calling people to start the armed revolution. Or if youll be encouraging other people to get a weapon and go out shooting people. As I see it thats not as much as limiting freedom of speech  thats more like removing a speaker from madmans hands. For example theres quite a lot of proUkrainian groups on the largest Russian social network  VKontakte. Some of them are getting blocked obviously enough  but not for being proUkrainian as you might be surprised. For spewing obvious propaganda. For calling Putin a dickface too. Thats not really something you can do when there are k of Russians are subscribed to your news.Also theres quite a lot of independent press in Russia Meduza Lentach Slon Dojd some others less popular so the rumors about the fact that all of the media is controlled by the government is lies as well.As to what I think of it any media is getting paid. The socalled independent ones are getting paid from some other pocket thats all the difference really.RT is not really as biased as media outlets like Pravda  man that shits really toxic! Im Russian and I cant read that stuff thats so full of bullshit honestly... RT is okay though. People comparing FoxNews to RT arent quite right  FoxNews is quite similar to Pravda.And to sum it up I really doubt that you can say anything you like in the primetime of the national TV in Europe.

Old East Slavic as you like to call it is certainly the parent of present day russian language but highlighting it as protorussian is a little egocentric. I would argue that if you look at old maps that up until the th century the region was better known as Moscovi or some derivative. But I can agree that to say one language is closer than another is really impossible.  I just know old slavic is still spoken in churches in Ukraine and sounds closer.  But Im no linguist.  Many words between UA and RU are the same and the grammar rules are very close if not identical.

I guess time will tell but I can as objectively as it is possible for me tell you that Russia will fall into a new dark age of poverty the people being those wholl once again be the isolated victims while the evil west will prosper. And this is not some form of gloating I have no desire to see the common man suffer its based on economical factors and facts available for analysis everywhere. Leaving all the particularities and intricacies of the conflict aside cant you see that this is about Ukraine choosing a different path than that preordained by Russia? Beyond the machinations that you think the US is making cant you see that this is about your countrymen wanting to be a part of Europe? Cant you see that what is being offered by Europe in terms of stability and lack of corruption is far superior to anything Russia has to offer? I am talking from the point of view of a man who knows both systems intimately. And this is what it all comes down to. Having a peaceful and prosperous future. You will not get that with Russia.

3266802,0,t1_cozubj7,Thanks for your solid reply and the sources I dont think that the EU has a stronger army than Russia  but whatever its like comparing apples and oranges either way.Stalin was power hungry as they get and there was no choice but to embrace him or die  personally I feel that Stalin will always be a black stain on Russias history and a text book case of whats the worst a radical state leader can do that said I do not think he was worse than Hitler but certainly comparable in his own ways  Hitler had his delusions and Stalin had his own both resulted in millions of people dead.He didnt come to power on his own either the Bolsheviks in their day were extremists who were funded by Germany and co to destabilize Emperor Nicholas Russian empire. Once the Bolsheviks came into power they obliterated Russias culture and people. I personally hate all the leadership of the USSR non of them were elected or chosen by people they were all grossly incompetent except for Stalin  who was competent but not in a good way. It makes me cringe like nothing else watching Kruschev and Nixons kitchen debate that the USSR had such a good thing going and they spent  of the GDP on the military that Brezhnev was literally vain with medals and that Stalin invented a new super military rank exclusively for himself... All these people are not real leaders with experience and personal maturity they are just thieves who wormed their way into power and poisoned Russia. People were not allowed to start businesses and there was almost no international trade it just blows my mind how bad they were a lot of Russias problems come from decades of subversion by the AngloSaxons but some of this is also just an excuse to brush off the responsibility off Russias leadership. Russia is an incredibly hard place to govern many fools want to become its leader just because of the power it gives them  controlling the state with the most land most nukes and largest European population sounds like a dream job but being the leader of Russia is actually a really difficult thankless and shitty job  angry mobs gang banged the last emperor and his whole family now hes officially been canonized and all the Russians I know wish the USSR never happened and some  of Russians actually want a return to a monarchy thats how bad they wish the last  years in Russia didnt happen. Russias entire history is filled with suffering and martyrdom and today people feel much the same but our history has made us tough and survivalist. I feel really gutted that the ideas of communism were stained so badly by Mao and Stalin as well as the USSR it isnt about war or dominating people or KGB etc.. its just become associated with all that now because those governments went about things in the wrong way instead of trying to bargain for public opinion in the media like they do now they picked the most primitive and worst option  to simply cut people from western propaganda instead of using the media as a way to do interstate public debate.It would be good if we could stop fighting each other in Europe because this has been going on for thousands of years and its just too costly to fight nowadays but I feel that America has a very strong influence in Europe and if Russia was incorporated into Europe  it would greatly diminish Americas influence there as well as globally so America will do anything and everything to stop Russia from holding hands with Europe.I think there might be war because America like Nazi Germany has too much confidence after a string of military victories their propaganda is increasingly loud and bold leaves little room for moderate perspectives.There is no news network to cater to moderate views its always extremism one way or the other.,russia,cp0n4im,1,t5_2qh75

Im not at all underestimating the size of that kind of war this is precisely why I think they would remain neutral.

3270077,0,t1_cp0z5ls,No offence taken. I know that you didnt aim to offen me or my family. Nobody does but for some reason when it comes to dehumanisationthe whole country gets dehumanised.My family is apolitical but whether they liked or not they got involved. My family comes from the city that borders with Ukraine  something kilometres from Kharkov a little bit more from Lugansk. And you know what disgusting? Those people who talks on reddit on press all those pompous speeches about politics and being smart logical caring deeply for ending this war and saving world from evil Kremlin and educating stupid Russians do nothing.My family from other hand does its good deeds silently without big words helping people who lost their houses their families their lives for nothing. Because of stupid dirty politicians. I talk about thousands of refugees in my city who escaped as soon as possible to the city where people die at  because of cancer open mining. Not really nice place to live huh? Better than nothing for these people who are going to be dead next week if they didnt escape. For some reasons rape war victims are to blame. There was no single humanitarian aid from Kind Smart Redditors to help them. Even pampers or baby solutions since there were lots of pregnant womenwomen with children. Its not so hard right? Its just  bucks. There was no single apolitical report of how thousands of people flee their homes in hopes to at least save lives. There was no awareness raised about circumstances of refugees. Dont they deserve help more than another politician?..But everybody has something to talk about politics. Yes its connected but why Human Drama never got its spotlights? Blame Putin is the only excuse for ignorance. Always blame him. I wouldnt get involved in politics if my newsfeed in Vk there were not appearing nice pictures from official Ukranian publics. Like I already wrote a witty jokememe with a woman holding an infant real one in dish and preparing to put it into gas ovenkitchen one with the words Best Russian  dead Russian. Or this horrible YouTube video and pictures from Odessa May nd. Yes they might have been separatists or whatever they are called. Their protest might have had some provocation. They might have been the worst human being on earth which I dont think at all. But burning them alive in the building with the mob cherishing it and shouting Glory to Ukraine and joke Kill all the Colorado bugs in the moment of execution. And then some official big people doing statements on their Facebookit was nice shashlyk barbecue. Need to repeat the fun. Thats just a little bit over the board. I dont even want to talk how official Maidan public commented on it. Even SS high commanders who sent millions of Jewish Slavic and other people to die horribly got better treatment. So where are the good people here? Wheres justice?Its not about who is smarter. I was in  smartest kids in Russia back to my high school years thanks to Olympiads all of them in economicssocial science. All national some international. I was applying to MIT as first choice Harvard as second couldnt continue because didnt have enough money for TOELF  family drama. But there are things that are not about rhetorics. These things are about being Human. And apparently world is not quite interested in helping those who suffer. World is more interest d in pushing propaganda  showing everybody else how they are smart asses  blaming only one person for all of that. And thats sad.I dont want any holly war right now. Its sad that if Im russian and Im sorry for people and I just want war to be over Im called ProKremlin bot. If I dont support Maidan how can I after all this dirt I saw put on memy countrymen called us slaves sub humans Colorado bugs zombies etc I am proKremlin bot. And forbid God to tell that I see logic in DNRs actions and their desire to stop the war and can empathise with people who dont want to live in one country who called them bydlo white trash and killed their families I would be seperatist. Or terrorist.Its so sad that theres only white Blame  execute PutinHitler and black Maybe DNR are not terrorists. Its so sad that by the time Mr. Nemtsov died the bomb exploded for one his death while he as any Russian politicianor any politician might and I empathise might be not such an angelic politician. Most likely there was another child who died in Donetsk or Lugansk. But who gives a fuck about these children or women? In public eyes they are just unlucky or blame Putin and save the world from him at best or deserve the punishment because they are seperatist at worst.Back to conversation I see that millions of good men do nothing to help this woman or this child to survive because the only thing they can do is to blame PutinKremlin call everybody who has other opinions Kremlinbots and spam reddit with their expert opinions. So I have more respect for my city men even though Im in bad relations with my family and hate my city who dont get into smart conversations on reddit but provide those who are in dire need shelter food work.

You have strongly proven that there has been atrocities by Ukrainians. But it serves the purpose of furthering the war and continuation of atrocities if you seek to paint one side as good and the other side as evil. This only creates more violence because it separates people to tribal us versus them mentality. What often happens is that the them group is stripped of dignity which leads to more atrocities and inhuman behaviour.We should see both sides as human capable of both most caring acts and on the other side of the spectrum capable of cruel and brutal behaviour.Illustrating a onesided story of evil adversary will only further the war and cause indignity opening the door for more atrocities.,russia,cp5jlw6,-17,t5_2qh75

Anyway you made exactly two points Ill parry. Sanctions nobody. Cares. About your sanctions. To be honest most Russians laugh when we hear that some other country wants to enact sanctions. It just seems absurd and pointless to us. Banks do suffer maybe the exchange rate but overall there has been and will be no  largescale effects on the Russian lower and middle class. But the rich will lose money indeed. Who cares though? Russians dont rely on banks like Europeans and Americans do. We dont live on credits we own what we have and live on what we make. Most Russians dont have debt! We really really dont care about sanctions. I just want to stress this since many people dont seem to understand this. You did make a valid point in the end though. The s created many problems for Russia mostly a result of shooting ourselves in the foot and selling off everything worth anything to the highest bidder. The crime rate the death rate the corruption. All horrible. But since  weve been slowly getting out of the situation and I feel Russias gotten over then biggest hurdles it was facing. Besides corruption. Thats still every bit a problem!

Russians dont quite care about Poland to be frank. Its quite obvious that all the heat is on Polands side. Russia invited the Polish president to Katyn to remember the massacre of Polish Officers during ww. When the plane crashed It was obvious Poland would call conspiracy and blame Russia for it. Do you think Poland helps make relations any better by publicly lying and being offensive?. Ukrainian unit devoted to Red Army was first to reach gate of Auschwitz therefore all credit goes to Ukraine and no one else? Its quite obvious that the Red Army was made up of all ethnic groups even at the liberation of Auschwitz. Poles just dont want to give any positive credit to Russians. This was a stupid and uncalled for remark by the Poles. You offended the millions upon millions of Soviets that died to stop the Nazis from completely taking over Europe.. Poland openly accuses Russians for holding Victory Parade in Moscow. This is by far the worst most ignorant of them all. Russia invites all the world leaders. Poland wants it to be in Berlin London or Warsaw. Whats stopping you from creating your own? By all means do it! DO IT! But dont blame it all on Russia. Im sorry who completely took over the city of Berlin? Who suffered the most soldiers from the Nazis? Dont you think its reasonable to have it in Moscow? People dont think of just how many Russians died from the Nazis. Constant constant fighting them off in Western Russia.

I know this is judgmental but Ive never heard of these two organizations before and I couldnt really find anything about them online so I would like for some organization with more heft and reputation United Nations Amnesty International Human Rights Watch etc and no bias in the conflict to take a look into these claims. Id say the exact same if it were two never before heard of AmericanUkranian NGOs with super generic names saying that DNRLNR were committing war crimes. That said I would unfortunately be really surprised if both sides of the conflict havent committed plentiful war crimes. Neither side is comprised of particularly professional and disciplined forces  on one side you have some nationalists and unhappy conscripts with a fuzzy idea of what they are fighting for and the other you have idealistically driven former farmers and factory workers with some Russian conscripts who probably know innocent people whove died in shelling by the UAF and are pissed at proKiev Ukrainians. Before we have our next conflict all those who have a voice in whether or not there should be a war should watch a hour marathon showing all the death gore and graphic results of war and think through whether or not it is really worth it and maybe they could instead solve territorial disputes over a soccer match or a fucking vote instead. I think the same should have been done about Iraq I remember all the Americans were shocked and horrified once contractorssoldiers started getting graphically killed in Iraq and soldiers started coming home in body bags all that jingoism and bravado goes away pretty quickly when the reality of war strikes home.,russia,cpesuqw,11,t5_2qh75

The Polish army was tasked with the ground invasion but Im glad we at least dont worry about that anymore. Nobody has threatened Russia with nuclear strikes because of its defenses in fact nobody has threatened Russia with nukes because of anything. The missile defense program was canceled in Poland and the Czech Republic in  after criticism from Russia and the rest of Europe. Instead it was replaced by medium and short range interceptor systems not anti ICBM as a result of Russia moving medium and short range systems closer. The last couple of years a lot of European nations have renewed discussions and plans of anti ICBM measures though as has Russia. Bush pulling out of the agreement in  was stupid however he stated that the reason was it limited the US for protecting itself from strikes from rouge nations remember  was at the height of US terror paranoia. In  he also signed a treaty with Russia to limit deployed strategic warheads. Im not talking about rhetoric in the press or some fringe minority political parties as both Russian and Western news agencies and public profiles have been contributing to an atmosphere of mistrust and hate. Russia has gotten sanctioned and threatened with economic measures because of its active role in destabilizing Ukraine.

Peoples point of view is affected by their background and experiences. Relatives of Jews who died during the war or who managed to escape will probably say Nazism was the worse. People who survived the war and were forced to live under communist regime will might say that latter was the worse. gtThere was a reason. But it was not because they saw Poles as an untermensch.They were killed for one reason. They were Polish. Thousands or maybe even millions were relocated into deep Soviet Union for the same reason. They were Polish. ,russia,cq1asik,0,t5_2qh75

3954107,0,t1_cr6zq7z,GDP tells a similar story. Since  Italys GDP grew by . Meanwhile Russian GPD quadrupled  over  growth in the same period.You cant ignore the fact that Russia is still an emerging market. The gain of an extra or extra spending on Development project X is marginal compared to the enormous harm that loss of spending would do to the military. I probably should also mention the economic value of having a domestic and active military industrial complex and the income Russia gains from arms trade. That will all go away very quickly without adequate investment.As I added above which you may have missedThere isnt some magic one size fits all percentage for defence spending. Italy spends . because it can afford to they can disband their military and no one would invade them because they are protected. Russia does not have that luxury. China is modernising their military at an alarming pace  this means Russia has no choice but to modernise as well. Each country must spend as much as they need depending on their unique situation.If you dont spend enough and happen to have hostile or opportunistic neighbours  you get invaded and defeated.,russia,cr702oc,6,t5_2qh75

The agreement represents a potentially significant step toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict and the restoration of Ukraines sovereignty consistent with the Minsk agreements from last September.  We especially appreciate the tireless efforts of German Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande to reach this new accord.  We call on all parties to carry out the commitments undertaken in todays accord and the September agreements fully and without delay.  This agreement must now be followed by immediate concrete steps to fulfill the commitments by all parties.  The ceasefire must be implemented and honored.  Heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the conflict zone and Russia must end its support for the separatists and withdraw its soldiers and military equipment from eastern Ukraine.  The true test of todays accord will be in its full and unambiguous implementation including the durable end of hostilities and the restoration of Ukrainian control over its border with Russia.  The United States is particularly concerned about the escalation of fighting today which is inconsistent with the spirit of the accord.Heres a transcript of a US State Department press conference from February th.Conference Excerpt beinggtQUESTION  ...

Ukrainians march to celebrate a murderer  Then attack a reporter  leader of the militant terrorist branch of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists OUN Bandera became a Nazi collaboratorBy working with the Nazis Bandera hoped to free Ukraine from Soviet rule and establish his own government there. An independent Ukraine Bandera promised would remain friendly to Germany. Bandera his deputies and the Nazis shared a key obsession namely the notion that the Jews in Ukraine were behind Communism and Stalinist imperialism and must be destroyed...then helped to launch a pogrom that killed four thousand Lvov Jews in a few days using weapons ranging from guns to metal poles. It is a sad comment on Ukrainian memory that the man declared a Hero of Ukraine in January headed a movement that was deeply involved in the Holocaust. This is what this Bandera guy was for and endorsed NSFL LINK  NSFL  Ukraine government  The Rada gets all the politicians to hold a moment of silence for a Nazi war criminal SS officer who commanded UPA    Democracy Ukrainian Style Kolomoyskiy threatens the head of Naftogas that he will send his nazi battalions to capture a power station or others.

Shariy outlines a ton of symbols and swastikas of Aidar battalion. This is what the US and the west supports and funds. Then theres an interview with leader of Aidar  people who western media glorifies. He talks about white power. Ukraine for Ukrainians. Blacks cannot be Ukrainian etc. At the end of the video Shariy says that even the Minister of Defence of Ukraine has said that Aidar does not use Nazi symbols and this is just antiUkrainian information warfare... lol... I guess this is just a Putin photoshop then.     Ukraine going full nazi. Using OUPUPA tactics for SBU tactics...  SBU does not need to invent anything extra  it is important to build on the traditions and approaches of the OUNUPA security service. In WW OUNUPA militants killed at least a million people including almost  thousand Poles.  Then they put Yarosh  a Nazi as army advisor  More info on UPA The Volhynian massacres were antiPolish genocidal ethnic cleansings conducted by Ukrainian nationalists.    and  Ukraine Recognizes Ultranationalists as Freedom Fighters   More Ukrainian democracy. Right sector tries to disrupt a peoples council. Masked right sector nazis beating people up in Kherson. They have knives and guns. at  one even tries to shoot but has a misfire  in Odessa. Masked Right sector Nazis kidnap people in broad daylight as the police look on. Then a bunch of protesters are arrested... freedom of speech in Ukraine  Backstory is that these people were simply protesting the price increase of utilities gas electricity  and low pensions. The right sector nazis decided that all of this is Anti Ukrainian and anti democratic so they decided to disrupt this meeting and arrest people  and   Ukrainian democracy  Odessa holds a right sector Nazi march under watchful eye of police  and   More proof of Nazis in Ukraine serving in army and in battalions   Graham Philips was denied entry into the London Bandera Nazi war criminal museum by butthurt Ukrainians   Ukraine glorifying and writing puff pieces about Nazis and how great they were.

Israeli blogger talks about the nazis and fascism and UPA and bandera scum glorification in Lvov in Oct    Lvov Svoboda nazis stop a communist party member from leaving his home threaten him tell him not to wear georgian ribbons then throw milk on his face  Ukrainian brainwashing and propaganda. Nazis from Right sector show school kids how to use weapons   Right sector nazis take over a church while old grannies try to block them    ukraine honours people who died during repression near eu embassy by having a right sector nazi flag at the meeting...wtf   Ukrainian side right sector nazis torture war crimes pow cutting off fingers of prisoners. Not only did they break the minsk agreements by attacking a block post near donetsk they are now engaging in war crimes   and    Right sector and ukrainian UPA nazi flags hung on ukrainian positions... nazis fighting for ukraine   democracy and freedom in ukraine Kiev Mayor Klitschko Gives in to NeoNazis Opposes Gay Parade Right Sector threats succeed again in Kiev this time limiting the rights of Ukraines LGBT community.

So you would eat econ for breakfast  dinner and supper and bath with economics.Im not going even to retaliate about your ad hominem attacks. Id quickly say that Ive been doing projects for one of the think tanks which you quoted and I perfectly understand the role of the base case. WB has repeatedly said that oil should be OK and Russians would not shoot themselves in the foot not the most robust forecast given the last  years.The problem is that you have no idea whats really going on and try to measure economic success by looking at numbers which are not particularly reliable and robust to forecast economic performance. You could start with observing how often WB and IMF revisit their forecast about Russian economic growth. Be honest. Are you serious minus  is gonna alter the budget and show that everything is wrong? Before financial system holes have been revealed that is not even a start for an analysis. Potential recapitalisation is gigantic. Should I remind you that DIAs coffers have been empty for some time already?  Pension moneys have been abused for a long time already. Thats not even the most significant. Thats just tiny USDbln missing well used be USDbln just a year ago. Otkrytie is the story. None of your links respond. Russian companies often finance themselves using offshore vehicles or subsidiaries wich mean certain portions of debt can be offset rather than repaid. Estimations showed that around  could be attribued to this type of transaction. Central Bank reservesthat are growing by the way are enough to counter any threat from that by lending directly dollars. Wich completely block this threat.What threat do you have in mind? Why do you think that offshore loans would stay in the Russias economy if the situation turn real sour like Evtushenkovs case.I already show you datas from the World Bank  the IMF and Trading economics showing that inflation is falling since  months while prediction show it will be lower more the next monthsIndeed one has to be an economic genius to state that if the exchange rate stabilizes the inflation would decrease ceteris paribus if recap needs are moderate which are not and if it is politically sustainable to make real budget cuts which is probably not. May I remind you that inflation is a best way to confiscate wealth from the citizens companies and households alike? Besides that the correlation between the exchange rate and the oil price has been very high. Do you think that CBR or the government has any say over the key factor of RUB performance? It does since it is given results.Please provide a peer comparison of key economic variables with peer countries to provide ANY evidence for your statement.

Trade preferences for our Estonian partners constant cultural exchanges students exchange few monuments opened in Russia to show respect to the Estonian history massive investments into Estonian infrastructure. Visa free regime welcome to Russia comrade! Next take few politicians who will have a chance to openly promote their prorussian views. And boom EU migrants crisis and Estonians are like lel fuck those EU losers they can live with niggers if they want were going into the EEU Dude Russia managed to turn Fundamental Islamists Chechnya into the most loyal region where  are actual Putins supporters in few years. But if well start to do same in Estonia it will be viewed as the act of war by the oldEU side.gt I can understand that but you cant force countries to be your allies.US are able to do it for decades with right approach. Soft force.gt And we should not force them to like west more. At the same time I think that Russia shouldnt force other countries to like them every country shouldve a choice.Ukraine proved it impossible. You know Russia had nearly no any politics in case of the Ukraine no one care like oh where they can go? Nearly no NGOs no nothing. While at the same time EU values and cool stories about western future were heavily promoted. And Results? Even it was absolutely economically unfavorable  people said Nooo fuck we want to the EU they promised us membership and we will be able to go work in the EU. You cant believe what bullshit current UA PM successfully sold through the media to the Ukrainians. You can find videos with him on youtube. Pensions ! Investments! Freeeedooom and Democracy! Ukraine can be main suppler of food for the EU lol sure.If you want country to be your ally you have to promote your values. Just like with the girls. If youll leave it as it is she will just pick someone who have more money and long thong. Political advertisement its same reality as advertisement of products by corporations.gt Well but armed men from another country came before a part of country separated its still using force.it was after government overthrown. And again it caused a lot of expenses for Russia but everyone in Russia got it right and agreed that we have to take Crimea back moreover Crimeans want it. It was rd attempt of Crimea to run away from the Ukraine. If you read Crimea local forums you could notice that majority are heavily prorussia even tatars are checked yesterday accidentally Crimeans cussing with mainland Ukrainians on hard mode. If Russia just refused to help Crimea could be even worse warzone than eastern ukraine. With same accuses to Russia same or even more sanctions etc. But without Crimea and with clear signal to the current allies that Russia can easily betray them.gt Imagine that Ivangorod wanted to join Estonia some guys actually collected signatures about ten years back and our troops crossed the border before referendumIs there Estonian majority in Ivangorod who also heavily proestonian and ? Or maybe possibility of military escalation between Ivangorod and Mainland Russia? Youll not able to do it same way local militia will cause resistance for sure. And locals will not support it.

An occupation is an occupation  just because we did not actively resist it does not mean it was not so.

People listened to Western radio in protest. Just because you do not hear how we passively resisted the russificationsovietization that was happening does not mean it did not happen.gt Do you have it worse than some other countries like say Hungary or Poland? Of course you dont. But we do. Poles and Hungarians were satellite states ones which did not get massive amounts of Russians Ukrainians and Belarusians imported into their states. This is something that happened in the ies and ies  well past the prime of Stalin. The most farreaching consequence was this ethnic cleansing via massive import of foreign nationals. Walk on the street of Riga today and you will see the effects of the occupation. THIS is ethnic cleansing We would have been a minority in  more years.

5814333,0,t3_3us5xe,I think there will be a lot of problems with current RF foreign policies in the future quite frankly. The main problem is that it seems the government doesnt have any solid plan it just follows shortterm goals and thats it. Thats just called adventuristic foreign policy theres no smart Putins plan as people like to present it none whatsoever.The practical effect is that we have plenty of ongoing conflicts with RF involvement around the world and none of those are moving anywhere and the only thing which were doing about those  were creating a new ones. We have Crimea Donbass Georgia Transnistria etc... now Syria and Turkey. No solutions in sight no plans how to solve any of this but were desperate to put our fingers in anything we can. Lets just step on every single shit pile we can find and freeze in this pose!WTF honestly have we forgot in Syria? If its just a weekmonth of showing off our military capabilities  fine ok i get that. But its not like it can be finished in a weekmonth or even a year isnt it? And it constantly demands escalations  sooner than you realise we will have some kind of ground troops operations there as well why do we need to die there for now i wonder?And the conflict is constantly escalating now we have a clear problems with Turkey. Tomorrow with Israel Saudi Arabia etc. Why the fuck do we need that? USEurope created that fuck up situation in the first place let them deal with it how they want let them deal with refugees and the future islamic caliphate state with the size of europe there. Why do we need that instead of usual death to americans people there will soon shout death to russians which will lead to terror acts in Russia itself as well as some usual problems with dagestanchechnya. Let yurope have that theyre fine with it theyll march couple of times showing solidarity draw some more comics and accept more refugees in their countries  theyre happy doing that... Why the fuck do we need this? Are you mad?The world arabic countries and more so our western partners are not simpletons they have their own plans and games theyre playing which are in many cases directly against Russian interests do you think they will just sit there not doing anything? They have brains and resources to hurt us in many different areas and they will why do we need to expose ourselves SO BADLY? And thanks to their media it will look like us hitting ourselves anyway.

Ive talked to Latvian soldiers even the national guard. Every single one of them likes Americans and is thankful for their support but they dont really speak highly of their military skills onetoone. You guys have the toys and the tools but far as Ive heard man to man at least the Latvian guys simply are more professional. But Im just a damn civvie so I might not even get the full picture.gt  From a realpolitik political science point of view NATO countries are simply vassal states to the US.In a way yes however there is a bigger and bigger growing tendency to stray away from the Americans. Even looking into Wikileaks when for example you look at inner memos on the Baltic states very small countries which are very weakly defended from outside influence in terms of lobbyism and so on there is a degree of.. mildness Id say.. in the language which makes it feel as if the Americans read Yank politicians know theyve got the upper hand and they have got the influence but they need to be careful as all hell when exerting it and need to focus on the correct buttons to push.Europeans dont really give that much of a shit about geopolitics and stuff like that as long as our locality is safe. If no one is getting shot by Russian tanks in Eastern Europe or crazy jihadis in the streets of Paris were more than willing to ignore everything and maybe once in a while throw some Euros in the direction of some African countries to bolster our humanitarian efforts. If this is what it is to be a Yank vassal  I dont really give a crap. Were moving in the correct way read liberalism representation democracy transparency were prospering more than we have ever done in our national existence and we have a MASSIVE power tool against Russian aggression  Yanks chilling in our bars.

This charm  a blue swastika the ancient symbol of the sun and good luck  was adopted as the insignia of the Finnish Air Force. The white circular background was created when the Finns tried to paint over the advertisement from the Thulin air academy. The swastika was officially taken into use after an order by CommanderinChief C. G. E. Mannerheim on  March . The FAF changed the insignia after  due to an Allied Control Commission decree prohibiting the existence of ProHitler and Fascism organizations. The swastika was removed due to the resemblance to the Nazi Swastika.gtwhich one of them is you?The one next to you my dear nazi friend.

As for the a hypothetical coup against Putin I personally would not want such a thing because I dont like the idea of an unstable Russia due to her large stockpile of nuclear weapons. I might not like a lot of Putins ideas or policies i pretty much only admire his balls in telling powerful elites to fuck off but that doesnt mean Id want instability in a powerful country. There is a lot of shit I hate about my own government but I dont want an Obama coup or even a hypothetical Donald Trump coup in the future.

This is what makes it look bad.gtBut Im sure you condemn the fact that Crimea was spared this violenceYou cant mix this kind of rhetoric in when youre trying to talk facts. It undermines the rest of your post because it colors the post in a specific way indicating that you might have picked and chosen which facts to represent since nowadays on these issues there are enough facts on either dude to present a case that will overwhelm the average person.gtIf so are you saying that the reunification of West Germany with the GDR was a violation of international law?Again state level actors nowadays are almost always able to present a case for either side. They can make either side unassailable so no clearcut answer is present. The fact is that Crimea didnt try to become a sovereign state but immediately joined Russia instead.How is it different from Germany? Because Germany was occupied and split in WW. Theres a reason why its called a reunification.But your response to that is going to be Oh but Crimea was also part of Russia before sure that was indeed the case. However Crimea was not exactly occupied by Ukraine. And on top of that due to the policies in the Soviet Union the while russification thing and things surrounding it it is very difficult to talk about it due to the fact that many native inhabitants were forcefully removed from their homes during the Soviet period and were then replaced by Russians.Also you can cite Serbia if you want but theres many exSoviet countries that are trying to or already joined NATO.

The experience was awesome but I realize that the experience is not awesome for everyone and you need to have some particular traits that will make you love it.  An interest in Russian culture language or history for example will make it an awesome experience as well as being openminded about different things and a different way of doing things that may not be what youve learned is the right way to do things or to think about things  you need to think of it not was wrong but just different.  This involves being flexible and not being overly reactive.  You also have to love working with people love working with children and be able to work a crowd.  The pay was adequate to provide what I considered an acceptable quality of life.

But the point wasnt just to secure Russia tangible interests in Syria the point was for Russia to make its first large move to regain her place as a world power with major influence in world conflicts a seat at the negotiating table and most of all respect from the world. In a sense thats been achieved Russia is the lead power directing this conflict and its resolution while the United States looks clueless and not only is Europe confused on how to handle the Syrian crisis the states in Europe are facing domestic pressure to work with Russia to end it so migrants will stop coming which could lead to the added bonus of sweeping the issues in Ukraine to the kerb.Russia is a very old nation but the Russian Federation is a very new state and I think that the Syrian intervention will be seen as a turning point for its place in the world.,russia,daw0mdi,1,t5_2qh75

10286444,0,t1_dc9gmfn,Now that you tried hard with the graphic design of your post let me throw some light that might help. There is another post about that below with link to a video by a very respected by me YouTube vlogger  . At  you can clearly see that on the left stone the names are painted over with the Ukrainian flag blue and yellow and on top of it in YELLOW paint so tried to write  but as she wasnt the sharpest tool there was not enough room for the last A so the graffiti reads . Unfortunately this word does not require translation and is the same in both Ukrainian and Russian in meaning and orthography. So dear Watson by simple deduction from the fact that the graffiti writer was an illiterate idiot we come to the conclusion that it was written by a Ukrainian. Ofc the flag of the Ukrainian Nazi formation Galichina and the SS inscription under it on the right stone leave no doubt about that. Now if you go back in time as Anatoly did in his video you will plainly see that desecration and vandalism of the monument was done by the proNazi Ukrainian political formations Svoboda Right Sector and Galichina many times since  i.e. long before Russia to become the scapegoat for every human degenerate under the Sun. I hope that lengthy explanation to suffice and put your quest in search of the truth to sleep. Hasta Siempre! ,russia,dca0wm6,3,t5_2qh75

10563667,0,t3_5r8w2y,In my opinion rEurope is a place for EU propaganda not for a civilized discussion of Europeans. Approaches to propaganda in EU and in Russia are quite different they have deep roots in peoples mentality and patterns of problem solving.EUs approach to politics is to make people think that they are competent in every aspect of life. Climate energetics economics rocket science...  Expert opinions are formulated in words that are simple enough to be understood or at lest repeated by voters. Of course this is an illusion  EUs people in general doesnt understand more than was pushed to their heads by politicians and corporations. To solve something means to vote for some professional representative.Russian approach to politics is different. Authorities are believed to be competent and they should react to complains from ordinary people. Resources must be allocated fairly to solve problems. This focus is quite different.Hence the difference in propaganda approachesEUs approach doctor Smith said blahblahblah professor Hernicke argued that blahblahblah it means that voters of party X must think that Y is true and vote for it. Everything that is needed is to vote for the right representatives.Russian approach enemies raised their heads catastrophe happened some people are unfairly rich others are unfairly poor.

Firstly this is not a purely Russian position  this is known as civic nationalism as opposed to ethnonationalism and its becoming increasingly popular among the Western moderate right. And secondly the issue is technically threefold.The liberals involved are actually the globalists. They indeed want national borders to be weakened and erased while utilizing a divideandconquer approach to the society within each country. They arent the only ones though  because globalism tends to be favoured by the upper class there are quite a few people who maybe not as staunchingly pursue a class warfare agenda against the fatcat brand of globalism in a decidedly globalistic way.,russia,dd8c863,5,t5_2qh75

People forget that the U.S. has   categories of sanctions vs Russia. For Crimea for eastern Ukraine for Syria and for election interference. The ones for Crimea are meaningless just personal sanctions vs government ministers and businessmen close to Putin. The ones that hurt economically were the ones for eastern Ukraine because they targeted the economy.This is actually potentially good news for Russia since that means that lifting the other consequential sanctions is still on the table while letting trump look tough on Russia for not never lifting the Crimea sanctions.,russia,ddc166e,3,t5_2qh75

11645302,0,t1_dgfqnvo,Trumps NSA bluffed. No sunlight between China and RussiaThe Chinese Foreign Ministry announced earlier today that the Director of the General Office of the Communist Party of China Li Zhanshu will visit Russia on April  at the invitation of his counterpart head of the Presidential Administration in the Kremlin Anton Vaino. The Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in Beijing that the two officials will discuss ChinaRussia relations as previously agreed on by the countries leaders and that the Chinese side is confident that the visit will further galvanize SinoRussian ties. TASSLi will be the second top Chinese official visiting Moscow in April. President Vladimir Putin has received the First VicePremier of China Zhang Gaoli who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of Chinese Communist Party at the Kremlin on April  which was incidentally the day after the visit by the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Moscow.Zhang is one of the economic czars in the Chinese system and his talks with Russian officials focused on Chinese investments in Russia and energy cooperation. But part of his brief was to prepare for Putins working visit to Beijing in the context of the One Belt One Road summit on May  which will be inaugurated by President Xi Jinping.Lis forthcoming talks in the Kremlin will be of exceptional importance. It is only with Russia that Chinese Communist Party Central Committees apex organ which comes directly under party General Secretary Xi has such an institutional arrangement of annual consultations  although Russia is not a communist country. Li is a key aide to Xi and his counterpart Vaino reports directly to Putin. The symbolism is at once evident. At an operative level the unique arrangement ensures that the dynamics and verve of the ChinaRussia relationship unfailingly receives the personal attention of Xi and Putin. In sum it underscores that the two countries attribute the highest priority to their relationship.The timing of Lis visit is particularly significant. The Donald Trump administration has been bragging openly last week that a special chemistry has developed between the US president and Xi following their meeting in Florida on April  and that China is now actively helping the US to handle the North Korea problem. Besides both Trump and his National Security Advisor HR McMaster have openly boasted that Chinas abstention in the UN Security Council vote on Syria last Wednesday was due to this wonderful personal chemistry between the two presidents.Incredibly enough McMaster virtually went on to boast in a TV interview with ABC on Sunday that Trump has succeeded in creating distance between China and Russia over the Syrian question. McMaster claimed that Russia has been badly isolated in the UN Security Council. It is a nonsensical claim as is apparent from the BRICS Joint Communique of April  adopted at Visakhapatnam on Syria which virtually backs the Russian position.Conceivably McMaster is a novice in international diplomacy and his inexperience showed in the ABC interview. But then he happens to be Trumps NSA and even if he is a bumbling Lt. General who is a babe in the words in the world of politics his voice carries authority. McMaster saidWhat we do know is that in the midst of responding to the mass murder of the Syrian regime the president Trump and the first lady hosted an extraordinarily successful conference summit with President Xi and his team. And not only did they establish a very warm relationship but they worked together as well in connection with the response to the mass murder on the part of the Assad regime in connection with the U.N. vote. I think President Xi was courageous in distancing himself from the Russians isolating really the Russians and the Bolivians And I think the world saw that and they Xi saw well what club do you want to be in? The RussianBolivian club? Or the  in the club with the United States working together on our mutual interests and the interests of peace security.McMaster probably thought out of sheer naivety that with these harsh words hed deal a knockout punch at the Russians. No matter Trumps game plan to drive a wedge between China and Russia by exploiting Xis interest in a new type of major country relations with US it is preposterous that Beijing will allow any erosion to the SinoRussian entente. The point is for both China and Russia their number one priority in world politics will be to push back at US hegemony and here is no daylight possible between them for a foreseeable future. Simply put the relationship has created strategic depth for both countries to safeguard their core interests while also navigating specific concerns at any given point visavis the United States.We will never know whether Lis is a routine visit or has been conceived against the backdrop of the Trump administrations mischief to create misunderstandings in the RussianChinese ties. At any rate Beijing seems to be going the extra league to underscore the highest priority that it attaches to the preservation of Chinas mutual trust with Russia. Lis trip to Moscow and his consultations at the Kremlin can only make Trump and McMaster look somewhat like two country bumpkins who lost their way in the metropolis.Posted in Diplomacy.Tagged with New Cold War North Korea Syria.No comments By M K Bhadrakumar April   T,russia,dgg0bqy,3,t5_2qh75
