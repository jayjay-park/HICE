2459909,0,t3_2nptcj,Album of the Year.  I only really like a few of the tracks.  That being said its still a much better album than many of its contemporaries.  And just because I feel like telling you my all time LEAST favorite Faith No More song is Falling To Pieces.  The Real Thing is perfect except for that dismal pop song.  Yes even Epic is better.  ,MikePatton,cmfqvxy,2,t5_2s4w6
