122275,0,t3_1vhl1o,You should first go about calculating an analytical solution for this problem. Are the fixed joints truly fixed or are they pinned? Im assuming they are pinned?If they are pinned  the analytical solution should be available in a statics book. Or you could do force balance if it is determinate.Definitely use the truss analysis type when you go to solve in SolidWorks. If you model this member as a weldment  it will be a much cleaner and more accurate result.Edit dont worry about solving the entire problem first and in SW. Find a simple equation that represents the load scenario get the section modulus and figure out the deflection and stress. Then work your way up to more complex analysis.,SolidWorks,cescs8r,0,t5_2s5u2

Basically the quick fix requires this  Open your surface bodies folder   Locate Surface Loft  and right click it  Choose Delete Body  Go to Surfaces and Choose Surface Loft  For your first profile use the edge of Boundary Surface   For your second profile you need to right click on the Profiles box and choose selection manager  then click the edges of Surface Fill  and Surface fill  that are across the gap from the first profile  Hit the Green Check and make sure the loft looks good  Knit all the surfaces except for Surface Extrude  and check Try to Form Solid.That should get you to a stage where everything can be knitted together and made into a solid.

2299075,0,t3_2lj1nq,Gaming and workstation cards are contradictory in nature. They are very much similar hardware but the software drivers are written very differently. The gaming cards work well for well... playback. They render games and videos great. However you may find Solidworks will be slightly unstable as compared to a workstation on even the best of cards. Workstation cards are very good at processing stuff and more be considered as the stable slowburn version. They arent going to crash but arent going to be as quick as the gaming cards.If you want a card to do both I recommend going the gaming route with something like the Nvidia Titan cards or AMD R  at least. In my experience Ive found that gaming cards are better at running CAD than workstation cards are at running games. My home PC has an XFX AMD R  with GB of VRAM and its quite ok with Solidworks.Be aware however the official line from VARs is that gaming cards are not certified and they are not obligated to help you troubleshoot an unstable software in an unsupported environment.,SolidWorks,clvvrbz,1,t5_2s5u2

2380464,0,t1_cm5xm7r,ampampamp Stressstrain curve sfw gtgtThe relationship between the stress and strain that a particular material displays is known as that particular materials stressstrain curve. It is unique for each material and is found by recording the amount of deformation strain at distinct intervals of tensile or compressive loading stress. These curves reveal many of the properties of a material including data to establish the Modulus of Elasticity E. gtStressstrain curves of various materials vary widely and different tensile tests conducted on the same material yield different results depending upon the temperature of the specimen and the speed of the loading. It is possible however to distinguish some common characteristics among the stressstrain curves of various groups of materials and on this basis to divide materials into two broad categories namely the ductile materials and the brittle materials. gtConsider a bar of cross sectional area A being subjected to equal and opposite forces F pulling at the ends so the bar is under tension. The material is experiencing a stress defined to be the ratio of the force to the cross sectional area of the bargtgtImage i  Fig. Stressstrain curve showing typical yield behavior for nonferrous alloys.

The issue I see isnt so much with the overall shape but the holes. The other problem is you are going to need to flex it twice. A successful Flex feature on a part that has that many holes will be hard enough asking to Flex it twice is asking for trouble. That said you may just luck out and be able to bend it like Beckham into the desired shape. Youll need to fiddle with the degree of bend and the bend center to get it right but it may just be possible.All that said If this is for cosmetic display reasons go ahead and try and flex it if its for production where it needs a precurve when molded you will probably need to rebuild it with the curve knee shape as your base.,SolidWorks,ctb73t3,4,t5_2s5u2

6792192,0,t3_4537x2,Id like to chime in on this. My company uses PampG extensively in conjunction with a topdown design philosophy. We copy our library models from the source folders to the project folder. Up until the very day we downgraded to  this process was smooth and easy.Our process has been to keep only the customized components that are projectspecific within the project folder relying on our parts library for everything else. And no we dont want to copy that into individual folders. If you want an instant loss in file integrity thats the recipe right there.Now when we perform the PampG we get all of the custom components properly copied and renamed but none of their parent assemblies are looking at those components nor are those components looking at what should be their new parent.Our solution has been varied but for the most part we must use SolidWorks Explorer to analyze every single component in the destination project folder and manually reassign references. This is both tedious and laborious.Yes weve talked to our VAR but havent received an update that I am aware of. I shall contact them again to check the status as it appears SP. did not resolve this issue.,SolidWorks,d0m6mn6,1,t5_2s5u2

Welcome to reddit and thanks for posting.I literally moments ago just failed one of the CSWP segments by  points.Forgive me for asking if this is public knowledge but what is the roundingerror  on the text input fields assuming you use the proper decimal places? That in mind  I know the exam is computer based but is there any way to have a rep review?Additionally one of the parts I was given to import did not have  a material specified on the part nor did it give any instruction of material to use in the prompt.

It really could be as simple as Ive spent a lot more time in SW than Inventor.What I really like about Autodesk as a company is they basically give everything away for students and they define that very broadly. Instead of pretending like piracy doesnt exist like Dassault they let just about anyone get on board legitimately for free so new users can learn the toolchain without spending hundreds or thousands just to start going through tutorials.In any case I was under the impression Inventors always been cheaper for commercial seats  especially when you get into their suites packaging it with AutoCAD or their PDM software Vault now I think it used to be called something different.,SolidWorks,d4fy7jx,1,t5_2s5u2

10428191,0,t3_5pbw7n,Cut away half the handle left or right. Movecopy no translation the half handle. Cut away the section of the copied handle that is not the grip area...this tube will be the basis of a Boolean cutting tool. Move offset the inside hollow surface of the tube to the where you want the floor of the groove channels. Also to make it easier for Solidworks to to the subtract later on offset the outside surface of the tool to overbuild it. Now sketch on the front plane a square wave profile that is constrainedspaced the repeating distance of the grip ribs centered on the high positions. Use the sketch to do a cut thin feature of the moved face tool body  you will be left with a series of multi body rings that is the negative space of the groove channels. Then do a combine subtract of these rings to get the grooves. Put fillets in the floors of the grooves if desired. Then finally mirror merge the result to get the full handle.,SolidWorks,dcq3rew,2,t5_2s5u2
10500283,0,t3_5qd3az,Draw the footprint on one horizontal plane the inside and outside lines are your width rails. You then need as many references of elevation as you can get and their locations on the track. You need a rectangle at each spot with its lower two corners snapped to the inner and outer profile rails of the footprint. The rectangles height must be the elevation and they must all be on planes  degrees to the horizontal base plane. The orientation of the rectangles from above plan or overhead view must be  degrees to the direction of traffic flow on that area of the track. What you will have is crosssections of the track model you posted as if someone chopped it up with a knife. The more slices you create the smoother and better quality the model. When you have that all done use sweep options to sweep two rails the inner and outer lines of the track footprint with multiple profiles each rectangle selected in order preserving continuity. Mess with output options and preview to see what generates the smoothest geometry.Instead of rectangles you could also place a node above the track footprint at the correct elevation and centered between the two side rails in each location from above. You could then draw a D line through each node using a bezier curve. You would only need one rectangle snapped to the two side rails and one elevation rail accordingly to sweep three rails with one profile. That may yield better results.This is loosely how I would do it in Rhino not positive on the step by step for SW. This is definitely a datadriven model more data better model.,SolidWorks,dcybgg2,3,t5_2s5u2

If the program cost K and you have several employees using its a K yearly cost. You pop out several machines at K at least yearly  and you are getting a return on your Solidworks investment.
