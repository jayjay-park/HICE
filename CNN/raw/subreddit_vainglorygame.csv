The bot in the channel was developed by a friend of mine but we ported it over to Twitch and Ive been building it out to support queues and answering random questions. Its been really fun. However written in Python not C or C! Its still programming but quite different. Im certain that if you are experienced in C and C and know enough Objective C to make the game as functional as it is you must know Python as well!Someday Im hoping to get Frankbot some integration to your match history API thats only a twinkle in someones eye currently and be able to record games for me.

If your team is playing one way and your playing the right way. Then your the reason for the team disconnect.You staying in jungle when your team is getting rekt in lanes means you should be pushing lanes with your team.Im sorry but you need to take  of the losing responsibility. Ive had team members go afk and still won many many vs matches. Maybe you need to be the gank or support instead of carry.When I play as Taka I love being a glass cannon well my team supports me. However if they arent doing well then I switch my items. I bring out double crucible or warhorn so I can get my team out of situations. There is no right way to play a character. Only the best for the situation and if your losing that much it means you need to evaluate your game play. When you do that well meet in the hotness tier ,vainglorygame,cnotr9q,4,t5_32ob1

Most players will chase me for a while before going after my teammates. Once they start going after teammates I ping avoid and go to the enemy jungle. Most of the time our laner lives the other jungler gets some minions maybe even a kill and I get free reign in their jungle for  seconds or so.

3161926,0,t3_2wcqo6,Something I suggested on another thread was to become a threat. Catherine is inherently tanky full of stuns and silences and is great at chasing people down and being a menace. However youll notice yourself getting less and less attention as people learn to ignore you. If you show yourself as a threat they will no longer ignore you. They will either run from you which is impossible to do or they will try to fight you which kills themselves.Ive never played Catherine so someone might be able to provide further insight into the best option but I know you mentioned After Shock. There are other threat weapons like Atlas Pauldron Breaking Point Bone Saw etc. I wouldnt suggest going for Sorrow Blade as its too expensive and synergizes better with higher attack speed.Just thoughts.,vainglorygame,copqd2x,2,t5_32ob1

3407726,0,t1_cpgoxe8,Yeah! I noticed that! And the ArdanAdagio combo didnt you have a witty name for that one too? I just remember thinking it was very fitting.There were some games when I would build a War Horn very early on Krul. I think his lifesteal works with the bonus damage so after level  it was very easy to stay healthy in the jungle. However it didnt provide any combat stats so you could clear the jungle but if the enemy team came into your jungle you lacked an escape unless you use boots or War Horn active. It was a risky investment. You can clear the jungle as fast as it spawns without the upgraded contract but it also helps vs clearing lane minions or with Kraken.

3472234,0,t1_cpo1uxg,gt B The minions are at the turret but the enemy carry isnt there probably because heshe doesnt want to over extend In this situation it would actually be better for you to stay in jungle and farm. Allow those minions to stay close so that the laner can get back to farming as quickly as possible. It may seem like a waste of gold but those minions act as a time buffer for your laner to get back to farming. Make your money in the jungle.I was mostly addressing this point. I find that the gold in lane too valuable to pass up plus you have a second jungler that can cover the jungle camps. Jungle creep also gain gold and exp the longer they are alive albeit slightly so its not so bad to leave them up by comparison so long as the enemy team isnt stealing them away.,vainglorygame,cpo260p,1,t5_32ob1

3587287,0,t3_31fdj6,Overall Koshka doesnt require too much of a thought process no offense I play her a lot too. Shes tanky early does a lot of damage has stupid high mobility and huge engage range. The downfall is that she starts falling off to tanky comps after midgame.Now with most of the other champs you need more invested time. Put it this way Koshka has  very big Power Spikes.  is when you have Reflex Block and the other is when you have your first CP item. These come SUPER early in the game so when chosing when to abuse your power spike its fairly simple. With other Champions their power spikes vary in game time and in punch. My main point is when playing other champs learn your power spikes and how far you can abuse them. Farm a lot and play smart set up fights for when you and your team hit champ spikes and you should be fine.Hope this helped a tad bit.,vainglorygame,cq16fxa,1,t5_32ob1

Almost always do I get a reflex block.Only late late game do I consider getting a breaking point because I am surviving long enough to build stacks. Otherwise Ill just get more defense to stay alive.Aftershock petal takes skill to play but having talked to higher tiered petal mains it is the de facto way to play.You place petal activate the aftershock hit enemy. Do some basic attacks and the second ur aftershock has cooled down you lay a petal or spawn minions immediately. Your damage output is pretty much insane and u rarely die if u are positioned well. Couple that with breaking point late game and u are invincible. Whats great about aftershock petal is that you have the fastest ability cool down amongst all characters. It only takes u  seconds to cool down ur st ability at level  and it barely takes any manaIts a disgusting build and very technical and keeps it challenging to play well so theres always a higher skill involved.,vainglorygame,cqc7st2,3,t5_32ob1

The skill tier system goes off a concept called ELO which basically means when you win against people better than you you gain a lot and when you lose vs people better than you you lose a little. If you win against someone that is worse than you you will not gain much ELO but losing against people worse than you will cause you to lose a lot of elo. The tier Decentish bronzegoldsilver page updates every  games. For the people who abandon games youre just bound to find them the mentality in place is that in the long run you are paired with them as frequently as you are paired against them.To your last paragraph nobody is asking you to buy characters or skins. SEMC has done a notably good job in trying to not make this a freemium game where you essentialy need to pay to win although it comes off as free.

No. WP Vox is a formidable jungler that can be just as strong as a lane carry with range and an A skill that refreshes every  seconds and does two instantaneous auto attacks with  weapon ratio added to it. For laning Vox can still hold its own vs Ringo although I feel like there isnt much advantage for either side.

4226597,0,t3_39bi47,The problem with Skaarf is his fan the flames is probably one of the hardertobalance components of the guy. Auto attacks are useful during all points in the game and Skaarf often enjoys favourable trades because of it. His Q kit aside the rest of his skills require you to be in mid range to be very effective. Skaarf organically pushes the player into a position where they therefore also wants to take advantage of fan of flames. I purchased Skaarf when he was first released and his fan the flames was just slightly worse as it was the previous patch. Now it has a really shitty rampup again. Its just the way its going to be balanced until SEMC finds a good equilibrium. Maybe consider taking advantage of Aftershock now. I build Mafia Skaarf when this happens double salvos in the earlymid games. Ps. I agree though I think the damage is very small even with enough auto attacks.,vainglorygame,cs20bys,3,t5_32ob1

It will only pay out  ? Gold over the course of the match and its on a timer. If you take that gold then youre getting double effective gold by denying it to your opponents. Turrets can always be taken later and the enemy team can destroy your turret in return and balance out the gold difference.

4542673,0,t3_3d8tso,Your typical supports are going to be Catherine Fortress Ardan and Adagio though you may see Joule or Glaive and maybe even a koshka though her tank capabilities have been nerfed and is not as viable. I would say the most important thing is finding good synergy between your support and jungler and to some extent laner. You are going to be supporting your jungler most so I think its more important to work on the synergy there. I like Adagio and Cath with Taka right now though I used to prefer Ardan with Taka. I see Taka paired a lot with fortress too which gives Taka a stronger early game though I dont like their synergy as much late game imo. I like Catherine paired with just about any jungler right now though especially if they also have a stun Koshka glaive Joule. Stun lock is real. Fortress is really great with Koshka I also like Adagio here too. With Rona I like Fortress or Ardan. Krul  Adagio or Catherine.

One find players who wont mind playing with non meta teammates and testing out new builds. Two just accept some people are no fun cry babies who get butthurt if everyone doesnt play exactly how they want. Mute them have fun.If youre looking for someone whos new to the game to be upfront thats just looking to have fun in casuals and learn the game add me wingsofdeathxx,vainglorygame,ctz7po8,1,t5_32ob1

4935821,0,t3_3iih9s,So instalock Taka did basically what youd assume the entire match. He ran around solo ignoring pings and refusing to group up midtolate game. He initiated each teamfight and we were demolished in every one of them without his presence. We did get a lucky Kraken after killing SAW and pushed it to the last two turrets by the time Taka respawned. Cath and I turned and ran as the Kraken reached low health and snagged the enemy minion mine. At this point we only had two turrets left ourselves but we were potentially back in the game!To our horror Taka now respawned repeatedly pinged the enemy base and we realized that no matter how many caution pings we threw at him he was dead set on dying alone. The enemy was on their way to the minion mine when he got thereway ahead of us and died yet again taking the turret down to relatively low health before he committed suicide on it. We got back to our side of the jungle and hid trying to get eyes on the enemy support didnt buy any vision so we were reliant on the very few mines I had placed across the jungle while rushed. The enemy team wasted enough time for Taka to respawn and he took off for the base without us yet again. Just as I reached the fray I saw Taka die at the hands of Glaives Afterburn and thought fuck this fight. I activated boots and dashed around the battle not immediately pursued though I saw Glaive turn around and leave our injured Cath just as I moved offscreen. A couple of stuttersteps later the turret was down and I had taken just one hit from it. Nice!Stepping around behind the Vain I hit it with everything I had double infuseddown to  health. Glaive was getting close and lunged down for an Afterburn but was too predictable with an immediate punt which I Reflex Blocked out of sheer luck. Briefly shielded I popped a potion and kept attacking until the Vain shattered. I was promptly eviscerated by Glaive and Adagio as they took their futile revenge. Edit you can see SAW and Adagio standing over my T Grandpa Ringos corpse at the Victory screen with no allies in sight. ,vainglorygame,cugp73l,2,t5_32ob1

During late game dont travel by yourself. Make sure you are with your teammates at all times and focus the hardest hitting hero first pinging go on them usually helps with team communication. Dont try to take all the minions it might make you stronger but if you die your weak teammates wont stand a chance against the enemy.

4965477,0,t1_cukfday,Thanks for the questions!. In the intro. I said the tier list is based off a mixture of Competitive and Solo Queue stand points. Fortress in a competitive format feels lack luster to me due to the fact hes so linear linear in the way where if you dont get a lead theres not too much you can rely on. This factor is AMAZING in the early game because aggression is great but in a meta where early game gets trumped by midlate scaling its quite bland. Ardan just has a lot more tools at his disposal compared to Fortress. In the end of the day I feel like most of the Ardan we will see is Jungle Carry oddly enough in competitive play due to support Ardan being the worse of the top tier supports. . OH! I love this question. Koshka is interesting. I dont think she will ever not be strong but her early game did get nerfed. Did it get over nerfed? HELL. NO. lol. Right now early game just isnt that strong in the meta. Its not necesarily her direct early game nef that hurt her its the rest of the early game nerfs stacked with her nerf that hurt her. Once we see early game come back which it will lets be honest well see her having a lot more play. What time of the game does she really shine? I cant give you an exact time because I havent really done the numbers. If you go aftershock youll just see her have a huge damage lead probably pre  but then after that shell get outscaled heavy if she doesnt have a huge lead. With the Shatterglass Brokenmyth thats going spike near the midgame and hold some relevance through the late game depending on how fed she gets. All in all Koshka is at a point where the first  minutes of the game have to revolve around her completely to have greater success in the midlate,vainglorygame,cukfqo4,2,t5_32ob1

Being able to perform well with random strangers takes way more skill then partying in my opinion so the two really need to be separate to make the game more fair.Im probably going to get downvoted by the PoA players who dont want match making to be fixed but whatever.

5300398,0,t3_3nl8e0,Generally its best to push lane out hard because this allows you to rotate down to jungle and fight with your team there while not missing farm. Also pushing lane out allows you to buy. Shopping is pretty important!Definitely push lane with Vox Ringo or Celeste. Celeste has flares built into her kit  use them! Dont be afraid to be at the halfway mark as long as you have vision in the enemy lane bush. Celeste clears lane SUPER easily. Skaarf is difficult to farm with. Realistically you can sit in a fairly aggressive position so you dont miss lane farm and simply shoot a fireball or back off when the enemy laner comes in to poke. HOWEVER note that Skaarfs early game wave clear is absolutely miserable so wave is going to be pushed under your turret constantly. This is actually one of the reasons Celeste is better than Skaarf  Celeste pushes lane easier so she can rotate and buy much more easily than Skaarf also tends to get more CS.Late game everyone has wave clear. Push lane rotate down. Unless your team is way behind in which case you should freeze lane so the enemy laner loses CS. Other than that push!,vainglorygame,cvp6qzw,6,t5_32ob1

Essentially you have  choices.  take theirs while they take yours. Its really risky but its better than giving them free kills.  go to lane and push the turret down. Mine the bushes around the lane so you dont get flanked and youll get a very early turret and that will give you enough map control to take your jungle back.

The best build seems to beContraption FountainAftershockClockworkCrucibleBreaking PointBoots  Breaking Point can be subbed in for AftershockClockwork depending on which you chose first. Contraption first is best because the scout traps do insane damage early game and the cool down helps a lot. As for what to do during the game in upper tiers Catherine and all supports follow their jungler most the game and only rotate to lane for ganks. In teamfights always stun the lane carry and if they are absent stun the jungle carry  NEVER THE SUPPORT. One general tips is to not use your abilities on minions while farming. The small damage aid is not worth you not having it for a teamfight. Another is to try to always use your ultimate C on all three enemies in teamfights. Of course this sometimes wont be possible but try not to be that lousy support that wastes an ultimate on the enemy support.

I stopped playing for awhile only to come back to this requiredIGCmeta where the support escorts the jungler everywhere. Not saying which is better since Ive won plenty under both systems but the forced IGC does mean that one player will be weaker at the very beginning which can make a game like youre describing that much more surprising for the opposing team. ,vainglorygame,cwxih9u,1,t5_32ob1

5654392,0,t3_3skc9h,Wiki definition of metagaming   Metagaming is any strategy action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset uses external factors to affect the game or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. Another definition refers to the game universe outside of the game itself. Metagaming differs from strategy in that metagaming is making decisions based upon outofgame knowledge whereas strategies are decisions made based upon ingame actions and knowledge.So what has been stated already but its a generally accepted best strategy in the game.  Like for example the stun comp meta.  Celeste CP lane WP Jouleglaive in jungle and cath at roam.  You have a stunfecta carry deleting comp that compliments each other well.  A lot of time people will follow the meta and just do what is currently most effective.  But you could break the meta doing something that is a bit off the wall compared to the norm.

If youre waiting  minutes for a game you must be in PoA or VG.  At those ranks Id bet it is more people being picky about what team comps they want an autolocker in PoA is still going to be a competent if inconsiderate player.

5702158,0,t1_cx35uw3,gtI think the fact that both WP and CP builds are viable on several heroes is actually one of Vainglorys best points compared to other mobas. Generally they also tend to have notably different playstyles too.Different builds also require different playstyles from your teammates. This is actually something Im focusing on as a support a lot lately....CP Ringo needs way more help early game than WP Ringo for instance.Like you one of the reasons I love this game is the subtle variety that I was totally oblivious to when I started playing....makes me wonder what else Im completely missing now! Ive never played other MOBAs so Im probably  clueless....,vainglorygame,cx3wpa5,1,t5_32ob1
5723554,0,t1_cx6jwco,Ironguard only gives gold to the team member with the least farmed gold making it a fairly useless item for laners such as Ringo and SAW. The lane is incredibly gold rich as long as you can last hit properly and building at least one defense item doesnt break the bank. An early T defense is paid for by a single minion wave. My final build almost always includes two T defensive items although occasionally Ill only need to build one if we already have a lead my support is great at keeping me alive and the enemies dont seem to understand the value of damage diversity such as buying only a Metal Jacket if the enemies have two WP carries. Its a rare situation. Being able to construct a viable carry build with only  or  slots for offensive items is an art form in itself.,vainglorygame,cx6kali,4,t5_32ob1

5741483,0,t1_cx8rnrx,But what i think you dont understand is that the enemy team is plagued by such stupidity as well? So really the playing field is pretty even. I fail to believe that all the decent players somehow always end up opposite you and you only get the sucky ones again and again and again. The way i got over this was playing as an offensive support Ardan. Hit your jungler or anybody thats about to die with a vanguard and then pop a fountain. Makes them very hard to kill. If they live long enough even a WP koshka can kill something. While thats happening aftershock the laner into the ground or at least drive them away. As long as your team doesnt focus the support which still happens even in Pretty good silver its not just you people just get hyped on the fight you should win.The common advice i got was to jungle instead of support but that only led to everyone dying because my support couldnt well.. support. So i main support build support usually warhorn and fountain but fountain first and then i build weapon or crystal depending on the enemy build. Trust me if you know how to layer your abilities youll constantly aftershock... That HURTS. Also heres another tip NEVER EVER USE YOUR GAUNTLET TO INITIATE unless you caught the laner out or something. Your gauntlet is to SEPARATE. ,vainglorygame,cx8sbvk,5,t5_32ob1

A team is still a team party or not. While a soloq team might be made up of people with more selfish tendencies Im sure therell still be those willing to endure a short ban as opposed to ELO loss.. uwilmheath suggested that the person going AFK would lose ELO from this Im understanding that their teammates would not while uIratePirate suggested that everyone still lose ELO but the deserter would lose that  the lost ELO of their teammates.Ok so how will the system differentiate between intentional AFKers and people who are unfortunate enough to have their connection drop and cant manage to get back in the game or encounter any other sort of issue that might occur that is out of their control? How would that even be fair?In my opinion theres way too many things to take into consideration and way too many loopholes that would make something like this incredibly difficult to implement.,vainglorygame,cxjaq1o,1,t5_32ob1

6327055,0,t1_cz8rmsp,Wait youre saying people shouldnt have to improvise during a game to counter play? That makes no sense counte play is reacting to how the opponent is playing. You cant do that before a game. The closest you can get is by guessing what counter items will be needed based on the heroes the enemy team is using. Regardless you will still have to improvise since you cant predict everything.As for your view of counter play building an Atlas is efficient against Ringo. It isnt a temporary fix Atlas was made specifically for countering high DPS heroes and those that relied on basic attacks. The same goes with the other defensive items. They provide counter builds.

This meant the targeting UI for A was up but I didnt have enough energy to actually land it and it couldnt be disabled because the button was disabled because the energy was too low.

Playing wp as I assume you are max your a and b as the ult isnt amazing as a wp build. Also stutterstep  target move target move to maximise DPS and keep  moving.

6705992,0,t1_d0crczl,gt gamesSo. . . you havent actually played him at all. . .Im not an expert but his A is best for zoning. Use it to block your enemies paths. This keeps them closer to you and your teammates when theyre running away or they take the devastating second wave of damage.B has to be used IMMEDIATELY after your first auto attack otherwise I usually find it very hard to get it off. Some people complain the radius is too small but thats only because they havent practiced it or arent smart enough to build Frostburn. Reims perk grants him crystal damage to auto attacks so with FB AAs slow. Generally speaking youre going to be casting his ult directly over yourself most of the time. If youre playing Reim correctly youll be the first target in a teamfight and this its exactly what you want. If more than  enemy collapses on you right from the getgo just slam your ult down right on your head and wreck their team.My build is currently up in the air because Im fairly new to Reim. I start with the recommended battery and try to rush an Eve. If Im not feeling too pressured Ill build up to tier  boots before finishing the Eve. Next Frostburn I havent had a game against a serious late game comp but Id reckon you should swap the FB and EH in the order against that type of comp. Then its a wash for me as of yet. Ive seen and done Alternating Current to wonderful effect but Ive crunched the numbers and although the numbers arent perfect I believe a Broken Myth adds more DPS and that burst needed to end longer fights.EDIT I just had the realization that most of my games have been against Taka Koshka or other powerful early game heroes. In a slower meta its probably better to go FBgtSGgtBMAC. Id love anyone who goes out tries it and reports back for the benefit of the community.,vainglorygame,d0cyhb4,2,t5_32ob1

His A is nerfed His B is nerfed and his ult is just a stun so in short his whole kit has been fucked. His CP ratios are same as . except his A gives a tiny bit of extra duration of barrier the more CP you have but has no base damage which was  when overdriven. CP krul was strong in . if you went for a burst. AftershockShatterglass his base dmg of  will give you a HUGE burst of damage on his A which will catch enemies off guard.

Now Currently I am T Gold also and just had one game where we had the game won we got aced at the very end after one mistake of my solo Q teammates running in too soon.

6861277,0,t1_d0u09ic,WP Taka needs at least one good defensive item generally you want to build a T defense shieldarmor vs. The biggest threat just after you finish your first T WP item which will often be tension bow. A reflex isnt THAT required on Taka since you can B most of the stuns really a reflex is needed when you are up against Ardan or something. Anyway this defensive item is a good idea because Taka is a bit squishy. Sometimes two of them is a good idea as well. Depends on the situation. After the defense you want to go for another T Weapon power item often sorrowblade and then you finish off at least one defensive item against the biggest threat after that you focus on what to change your Blazing salvo into which you should have by now from your first item. I mainly choose between bonesaw and breaking point. When you choose this last WP item you can also choose to build another defensive item if needed or if you dont need it so you can build both bonesaw and BP or bonesaw and TT or BP and TT. ,vainglorygame,d0u1a1e,2,t5_32ob1

I actually cheer openly if I get to my shop and find the enemy took it because it means they are now just BARELY finishing their mid heal minion or maybe starting their back doubles. Super easy to invade pick up a double kill and steal their backs putting me at a huge advantage for the rest of the game. Starting shops was a good strategy several patches ago.

6901556,0,t3_4aa2xy,I definitely feel as though the system needs refining. Very rarely does a system like this become nearly perfect.The best system I can think of for managing players and cheaters is from CSGO being the Overwatch system. Here volunteers that have qualified for the system review reported matches and then give a verdict based on the evidence shown. For example a cheater goes in a game goes and cheats a bunch then other players report the cheater. The system automatically sees the reports and sends the evidence to the volunteers. They see that he was cheating and he is automatically banned.Many people see this same content and make a verdict on it so even if  people make an error  more are correct and so the correct verdict is made.Content in CSGO is also stripped of chat voice chat and names for anonymity so only an objective position can be made.,vainglorygame,d0ylz0j,16,t5_32ob1
6906935,0,t3_4abgmz,I think you may be reading too much into that. As I understand it its mostly in reference to what a lot of veteran players know. It takes being good with one hero to hit PoA and being good with a lot of heroes to hit vg. The logic being that if you play with one hero youre not flexible youre likely to lose more games you would otherwise win with other heroes. Thus plateauing.Once you start to rank higher than SA the odds will always be that you get matched down rather than up just because of the sheer volume of players below your skill tier are higher than those above. So to rise beyond PoA in soloQ you have to take those weaker players and carry them to victory in whatever role you play. Another factor in play is since youre matched with lower players on your team youre likely matched with lower players on the other team. And a loss against a lower ranked player will cost you more Elo than a loss against a higher ranked one.So you can see how with all these factors playing only one hero will NATURALLY cause you to plateau without director mmr or Elo manipulation based on how often you play a hero. This is just my own understanding of that quote and its at least what was commonly held belief in the community about how your personal skill correlates with your skill tier.,vainglorygame,d0z7y22,9,t5_32ob1

Be flexible maintain vision when you can have general map awareness build correctly master reflex block. I think the most important factor to winning in soloq is to have a positive attitude.

7095749,0,t1_d1kls5j,Jungle The Jungles job is to do  main things.  Ganking and  Objective Control. How are these accomplished?Ganking By surprising the enemy with CC abilities and level advantage. Objective Control Obtaining and Maintaining objectives over the course of the game Jungle Mobs Miners Kraken. A Jungle should by all means have a way they prefer to run the Jungle Mobs and then Gank. What level should the gank be initiated at? Should I be MIA to the enemy most of the game and appear to kick ass? These are types of questions you should ask yourself briefly. Really its not that indepth to know how you want to run it top to bottom or bottom to top. Simple. Knowing your champion tells you what level its safe to gank at. Let me share with you how I run the Jungle. Start Miner Mobs Top Heal Mob Mid Heal Mob Lower Mobs gt Store gt Gank. There is a variant to this I start Heal Mob Roam Starts Miner Mobs I kill heal mob then kill miner mobs we both go to the next heal mob together and continue on from there. This will get you as the jungler to level  with a good gold advantage sooner than running everything together. Its my preferred method but most of the RoamersJunglers I stick together with me. Ganking Ideally this is deployed while the Enemy is pressuring your lane. Safer for you lower risk and higher rewards. If not then the enemy should be around  health before hopping on them. Its better odds. Simple as that. Always have your first  items for me playing Joule that Boots Swift Shooter Crystal Bit. This gives me the ability to run away if my A is on CD. I do damage basically every second and my AB combo hits harder. Get in secure the kill get out. What happens if I dont get the kill? Thats on you do you chalk it up to the game and go back to the jungle? I dont I collect  minions from the line and go back to the jungle. That makes it worth it for me to remember to gank often. Gold advantage. Yes it takes a bit from the Laner. You and them have the same objective. But youll be handing them more gold later so its ok for the short run Early to Mid. Objective Control This doesnt need much explaining. I usually wait as long as possible to take your side miner. For whatever reason taking that miner makes the enemy team really pushy. Im all for a fight but I want it on my terms not a wild enemy team appears. Kraken should be taken in  different scenarios. st. ACE No opposition no problems THIS IS ASSUMING THERES A  SEC TIMER. Anything less unless you dish Tons of Damage you need to wait. . Their weakest or least brightest hero is the only one alive. Why? Take advantage of idiocy...just do it. Jungle Runs should be taken at any and all times that you have the ability to. To sum up this I want to simplify this into a paragraph. The role of the Jungler is to monitor the lane to gank while running a continuous loop in their jungle. They are also responsible for gaining and maintaining level and gear advantage. They should work in synergy with Roam and give suggestions as to wear to go. In this position you need to have the MOST communication on the team thumbs up smiles sad faces etc. Whatever is appropriate. In a game that lacks communication whatever you have is key. Try not to be rude and ping incessantly its just good etiquette.If you have any questions please let me know.

I would recommend getting her if you like Experimenting with builds and trying something new. Unless youre confident with her playstyle id say youd have to stick to casual matchmaking.However if you only play ranked get blackfeather. He is a top tier hero and he is quite powerful build CP or WP. His play style makes for him being able to be played in Lane and Jungle. Thus allowing him to be a great flex pick in draft.

7146394,0,t3_4dbhov,A bit more background why certain strategies were chosen for MMR  VST long text no tldr incoming just ignore if you dont like itRiotRiot gives out rewards depending on how high you reach in ranked during a season. This goes form loading screen borders profile broders hero skins  hero if you dont own them profile icons.Many people only play for these rewards they arent interrested at all in reaching the highest rank possible and stop playing once they reach the reward. When LoL started out with their pure ELO ladder there was a lot of trouble with ELO decay where even when you reached the desired tier of reward you had to play and win a game at least every  weeks. This can become pretty frustrating and Riot was aware of this. In addition to this the usual problematic of marketing a pure ELO ladder later more on that.So they introduced their VST version as explained by OP. The benefit of it it was made MUCH harder to fall down even when inactive and alongside with it a bit harder to get up in exchange. This was improved even further until today where you cant fall out of Gold minimum tier to receive the free skin. The downside of this the discrepance between VST and and MMR is quite large around the so called Division V of the lower tiers.Its less of an issue though for everyone dedicated to climb up the system works really well once you get to the tiers above Gold.Blizzard uses an ELO system with closely tied VST now for a long time in Starcraft . The VST are bound to a normalized gaufunction with the  point being around the upper bound of bronze. Its working out fine here since your skill is obviously only depending on yourself no teammates though it is grindy. Unlike LoL there arent really that many rewards to consider so no base to cater for that. People who play ranked do so to test their skill andor enjoy competitive games.Blizzard took this ranking version over to their other games as well Arena in WoW Ladder in Hearthstone Ranked in HotS.HotS like Starcraft didnt feature much of a reward. But since your wins are dependent on teammates they felt the need of showing you your progress a bit more detailed. The easy start but slow climb later though is just the effect of the gau function since the system tries it best to keep the number at the top on a stable low percantage.WoW Arena went the opposite way and took a pure ELO ladder approach for display with a hard  cut off for season rewards. Not many people really participating in it anyway.Hearthstone took a really extreme approach to VST on the other hand the progress indicated by stars and tiers until legend tier no fall back until you hit the basic season reward no clue given at all how good your mmr is. Where does Vainglory stand? We dont havy any reward incentive for ranked either. Ranked Que stands for wanting more competitive quality of games.So do we need and want progress each season the feeling of reaching a new tier again and again? If so we are in need of a VST with regular resets.If we are only concerned about improving overall and comparing our skill but not with reaching a certain goal we may as well get rid of VST progress and use a pure ELO ladder  some cosmetic VST every x ELO.,vainglorygame,d1qgxvw,2,t5_32ob1

I try to explain to people in my stream all the time how going for kills just for kills sake is hardly ever worth it. Sure it can be fun but if youre trying to win you need to make sure you take an objective whenever you secure a kill.

The thing is that people will instalock comfort picks and theyre not even that great at the game. They need to worry more about themselves than what other people are playing. A lot of players are way too rigid when it comes to the heroes ability. I think this is due to frustration of having lack of creativity knowledge skill and foresight to see how heroes and abilities work in creative situations.,vainglorygame,d2oenav,5,t5_32ob1

If the choices are limited to those in your title krul wouldnt be much of a good choice since you will be singled out much like SAW and to your disliking. Taka is like Koshka but with stealth and more tactical so its a good candidate. Ardan is a reliable roam so always a good pickup at some point. Skye is so dangerous that it will be like krul or saw except that you have a awesome defense called repositioning.

7511707,0,t3_4i8bhr,BR is definitely dropping Karma for lots of people. I think that perhaps the magnitude of impact for certain reports should be minimized or further minimized in BR.If youre toxic say  games in Casual or Ranked thats something around  minutes youve been bad. If youre toxic say  BRs thats around  minutes youve been bad. It feels like the magnitude of repercussion is still for the  minutes though making the impact .x larger than it should be.I cant confirm this I dont have access to data and havent done analysis. Pure speculation but if this is true we can pull BRs Karma impact down and the system should still work it is already supposed to ramp up for frequent reportswhich may also play a role in the compressed time period of BR but it wont wreck a good player for not being skilled with the hand dealt to them.,vainglorygame,d2w1l08,4,t5_32ob1

7540572,0,t1_d2zbl22,I think there is a misunderstanding of the system. Thumbs are only used to clear strikes not issue them. Your friends list being able to see your strikes allows them to know your eligibility for rankedrecent behavior. Trolls would have no way of knowing if youre on probation in a regular match. Keep in mind that while it takes  clean matches to clear the first strike that does not mean you are banned from ranked until those strikes are cleared. If a day later you log on and your cooling off period has run out then you can queue ranked and clear your strike that way. I dont think you run into enough trolls to keep someone from having  games with no thumbs down. What it does do is prevent habitual trolls of clearing strikes and thus sorts them to the top.,vainglorygame,d2zbrmp,1,t5_32ob1

And if the game continues to grow the amount of people asking for the rerelease increases to an amount you cant ignore anymore.It wouldnt be a devalue through rerelease though.

VG is such a breath of fresh air in the sea of PTW mobile games so it has the potential that people will be more willing to invest on it for the long run while it doesnt quite share the addictive part of instant gratification. IMO the new quest system  BR is a huge step to fill this part of instant gratification and if I were SEMC Id straight delete the ? ping for the sake of retention rate. Its such a killer when youre chilling in this cool af map with a cool af hero then someone whos supposed to be your ally ???? on you and you cant effectively fight back the villain unless you join his sinful side of ???? or afk. Even if you can swallow it and mute it really hurts the mood to go for another game either by stop playing or be too sensitive next game which is huge in the mobile market especially for a new player just hopping in as most other mobile games are fresh fun and moderately challenging in the early stages while they often bore out in the end.

Had a group match earlier where they unfriended me after the match because they dont understand counters and counter building always blame the support.  cp heroes and my  carries built metal jackets... Petal and Reim dont care about your jackets... Both teammates built wp and enemies countered with a metal jacket. Humongous struggle keeping a Joule and Kestrel alive in this scenario it was like they thought metal jackets covered defense period its inadequate against c. Especially when Joule stands on top of Reim. They should make hero spotlights mandatory to watch so I wont have to see my melee jungler stand in front of a Reim and die. Edit I wanted to add we still won this match due to me being able to forced accord Reim and petal off my carries and stun them after I got aftershock for the cooldown and damage...

7909213,0,t1_d451sfm,I can see why actually. With two players making up  of a team those two can have too much impact on the outcome of the game. Heroes of the Storm changed its ranked system up a while ago either forcing you to rank with a full team of  or by yourself or with a fired. No  or  man parties could rank because theyd have too much control over the outcome. They recently did a test where they set the Hero League the  or  man queue to allow  man parties in their Public Test Realm or PTR. There was some serious concern because three people being more than half or a team had too much influence on the game. I feel VG should take this system into effect having a solo queue ranking system and a  man ranking queue. ,vainglorygame,d452jnm,5,t5_32ob1

7915578,0,t1_d45m7qy,The more statistics about a player you use the more accurate you can determine their true skill level without being in need of a lot of data points. If you wanted to really determine someones individual true skill level in a team vs team environment youd need  games. Even for v its still over  games.So to reduce the number of games needed you add in more statistics.For the players you dont need to know this. You will get matched with teammates and against opponents of similar skill level regardless of the system.Furthermore the more games you get in the less Elo deviates from MMR. Usually you only see huge deviations in case of sudden win rate jumpsfalls. So lets say you had a bad streak of luck with leavers afk trolls etc. and lost  games in a row. Pure Elo doesnt care pure elo will remove e.g.  Elo from you.MMR on the other hand notices that this is a streak that your match results before that streak were much better and this is likely a statistical outlier. Therefore you maybe only lose half the mmr than usual from these losses.,vainglorygame,d45sb4r,1,t5_32ob1

They think that they are better than their allies and at some level want to see them fail. We dont trust them to be mostly good at the game or to perform their role. Instead we get upset at them whenever anything goes slightly amiss... When we could be moving on or potentially just trusting them and working together betterYour satisfaction with your queue is primarily determined by your attitude towards those who play with you.

8438638,0,t1_d5w9m9v,Great points! That said one has to consider if granting Roams max energy items being problematic like your mentioning for Catherine merely points to already existing problems. Perhaps Catherines abilities are a bit too spammable and with the proper itemsstats present itd be OK to fix that problem without shutting down Catherine as a HeroThe problem is that the issue overlaps Items and Heroes. When you change a Hero it impacts every game that Hero is selected in in Ranked this can be diminished via a ban. When you change an item it impacts every game it is built in potentially all games so its a lot more risky to make the sort of simultaneous itemHero revision Im talking about.

8488846,0,t1_d62egd1,Technically what occurs is that you cancel out the latter part of the attack. Basic attacks in Vainglory have three parts Windup Damage WindownThe windup frames are when the Hero selects at target and makes the attack motion towards itcanceling via a movement command during this phase results in no damage occuring. The damage is the part of the attack that guarantees damage can cannot be canceled but is extremely short. The windown frames are the followthrough of the animation after dealing damagecanceling via a movement command during this phase results in the attack cooldown starting earlier by however much you canceled. Since the damage portion has already occurred there are only benefits to this sort of cancelingSince attacks in Vainglory are dedicated to framerate the proportions can be scaled and thats how it works. No matter what your attack speed theoretically you can always cancel the last bit of the attack and start the attack cooldown earlier with the maximum result granting you  bonus attack speed from pure skill,vainglorygame,d62nig7,2,t5_32ob1

Late game I decided to build a bit more offense and it worked good. I really enjoyed playing with my teammates.After the match Alpha texts me and accuses me of stealing hisher farms?! I sometimes killed the healer camps when I needed it desperately.  The other times I mostly let my jungler take the last hit.

9507221,0,t3_5b12ab,Second Question   Catherine is very strong and I play her successfully many times as a roam main t. The guide you followed is quite good slightly outdate but solid. Nowadays i prefer contraption at any roam at some point of the game because Vision Wins Games So Tip  Lay down scout traps to guarantee your team vision and use some flares to scout dark areas. Even after buying contraption i carry flares too to guarantee vision anytime and to make contraption cost efficient by using it for mines. You are getting punished early game gt Put vision on your own jungle to be safer. You are rolling enemy team early game put some vision to keep the pressure up!Roams can change the tide of a team fight if they use their bailies to max potential. Fountain of Renewal Secure TeamFightsTip  Rush Fountain as a roamer almost any game. learn how to trigger it at the right time to max its heal the lower the heath the more it heals but not too late when your team mate is dead.Tip  Learn to read the enemy composition and build so you can build accordingly Counter the enemy team Crucible is usually very useful to counter Adagios Ult Catherines Silence Phinns Hook general CC etc.     Atlas counters high attack speed carries like WP SAW Krul Vox CP Adagio Blackfeather etc etc.     War threads is a strong engage and disengage tool useful in many situations    Contraption Contraption Contraption specially against Taka Kestrel and the upcoming hero Flicker  Tip  Lead your friends to victory  The Roamer is usually the Shot caller so its up to you to decide where to go what objectives to prioritise who to lock down and focus. This knowledge comes with time and by watching others playing Championships Streamers youtubers etcTip  Roams are Punching Bags you should Body block and shield your friends be a distraction or bait and sacrifice if needed in order to guarantee a teamfight advantage. Most obvious situation is using a Phinn Hook to save allies and then die xD Heroic Playx or running in a different direction if the fight is lost to prevent an Ace xDAnyway there should be a lot of stuff I missed but fellow redditors will help for sure.See you in the Fold ,vainglorygame,d9kyuh4,3,t5_32ob1

Also not thrilled that I cant simply buy the new SE skin outright like Ive been able to before. I plan on buying the  pack of keys which is a bit less than the BF SE skin cost and hoping that the Ringo skin drops and I will save any remaining keys for the next month.If it doesnt drop I will rage quit VG forever. Probably. Ok maybe not but I wont be very happy about it. If SEMC has some clue about retaining the loyalty of paying players they will set it up to ensure that the skin drops before a player needs to spend more on keys than the skin was actually worth.

He keeps popping up as wp carry. Then we get a cp melee jungler and a no ranged hero warning. So I have to pick Adagio or Lyra because I dont know who will actually take the lane.

If you have an SD card close the app. Unmount and then remount the SD card. then it should work properly.As for reporting the bug You can go to the SEMC forums.

Try to bait enemies in channels to guarantee roots. Also learn the lance wall jumps and rolls they are really useful in game if you master them.For Ardan dont be afraid to vanguard yourself to do damage and slow the enemy carry early game if you are close enough. Practice landing gauntlets in precise spots in solo practice and you will eventually be able to land at least one stun every time.,vainglorygame,dbozcyq,5,t5_32ob1
10108470,0,t3_5kmv5f,What I normally do with Koshka is push the advantage she has early and transition to a more semisupport role if the game starts to go late.  I normally get AS Boots BMSG depends on how the game is going Reflex block and then I build from there.  If the game isnt close to ending then I normally will start building Fountain and AtlasCrucible again depending on the game.This doesnt work in every game but when you have more late game laners then it works out fine.  Especially when you can get in there and chunk the squishier heroes to set up for kills.As for how you build her I dont think that FB has been a goto item on Koshka ever since they changed her passive and swapped out the ability cooldown reduction for the movement speed.

But you know a much more effective fix to this would have been a lighterweight infusion.Instead of changing the crystal miner changing the jungle shop etc. just make a  second infusion for  gold that can only be purchased from the base.  Make it last long enough to push the enemy out of your jungle but not enough to invade the enemy jungle. So you still have the potential to get ahead from the shop fight but if you stick around you lose the advantage.

10364225,0,t1_dcisaz7,Two main reasons Its makes it eventually nearly impossible for the matchmaker to pair games amongst the multitude of various blacklists. This isnt conjecture. Your idea isnt novel. It was brought up often in Leagues community yeas ago and it was routinely dismissed by devs as unrealistically cumbersome. Is great that you could still play against a blacklisted player until it tries to pair that guy with someone hes blacklisted. Now one of you three has to be completely removed from that queue attempt. And so on and on and on. If feasible at all especially with such a small player pool it would certainly be beyond bulky for such an unnecessary thing.  It allows people to blacklist non toxic players that they just think arent good enough to play with them. Past simply being wildly egotistical its super abuseable. Not to mention the game has a preexisting method of separating skills ranking. If youre really better than your tier youll eventually play yourself out of it. Simple as that. A blacklist is both inconceivable and unnecessary.I really dont mean to be a dick but you came out of the gate with a very holier than thou I know more than all of you and the developers atttidue. It wasnt something people were going to immediately respond well to.,vainglorygame,dciuhly,3,t5_32ob1
10371524,0,t3_5offgm,You can play any hero as roam if you build the right items. Rush fount prioritize vision and counter build successfullyBut Kestrals lack of cc her b is cc but is very difficult to land consistently puts her at a severe disadvantage to meta roams. And her heroic perk is not aimed at roaming. But by all means try it out. You might learn something about her play style by playing her in an off meta position. She might be decent at applying Atlas or shiversteal to carries because of her stealth. Maybe play roam Kestrals like flicker? She is definitely squishy so body blocking damage would hurt but with ages or Atlas it can be done. Definitely try it! It  expands your repertoire so that if you get a bad team comp the third soft locks captain but changes to carry at last second you can comfortably play that hero ala Kestral as a roam.

10658332,0,t3_5shv0m, You need to learn to Freeze the Lane and Farm Under Turret. These are necessary Laning skills for T. Freezing the Lane is intentionally keeping the Minions fighting in one place usually the center of the Lane. Its a balance act but the Lane is slowed when you let your minions damage the enemy minions and you only attack to last hit the Lane is sped up by you or your opponent doing more damage to lane minions. Farming Under Turret is also very possible and necessary when you have no support and your enemy is pushing Lane or trying to Gank. Basically small minions can be last hit after one turret shot large minions after  turret shots  you should only lose maybe  in  Minions this way. Theres nothing much you can do Laner or not if you have an Ally thats overextending and over confident theyre going to die. You can try to give them vision so they can try to survive the inevitable ganks but its also important that you dont die with them every time. If they die try to Freeze the Lane before it gets to turret.,vainglorygame,ddfbqah,6,t5_32ob1

10810907,0,t1_ddv0nis,Glaive has natural high HP so that theoretical are shield amp armor better then HP based defense like Crucible or Slumbering Husk.But thats depends all on the match up amp how much your opponents can hurt you before you kill them. Aegis is always great because Reflexblock is just awesome. But when the opponent CP hero isnt a big deal then you can stick just to RB amp dont need to upgrade it. For armor is again the opponent comp important.  T armor is usally enought upgrade to Atlas Pauldron only against heroes who rely on their attackspeed heavy.And Metal Jacket is usally only necessary when the opponent snowball you or when you face other high crit buildheroes like Joule. ,vainglorygame,ddv2hat,1,t5_32ob1
10816250,0,t1_ddvgu7s,Sams A requires a lot of skill and quick thought to be used optimally. The first shot can be fired like any skillshot but aiming it so the second can be aimed too can be challenging. If you place the shot target close to you you can pivot around it to aim at a hero running sideways in front of you and by placing it very close you can fire the second shot behind you. However your aim on far away targets will likely be poorer if youre not aiming directly at them. So you need to predict individuals actions on the fly to use it perfectly.His B requires a good idea of how a fight will move meaning you need to predict the overall movement of both teams for each encounter or risk significantly reducing your damage.And his C is best with team coordination and not immediately waking everyone up with AoE while both his A and B can be AoE.Anyways to sum up I feel he can be good without someone real skilled playing him but I think the skill gap between a master Samuel player and the average player is probably pretty big.,vainglorygame,ddvmbrs,3,t5_32ob1

Youve tried to take something as simple as adding a random character choice i.e Battle Royale matchmaker and tried to change it to a random soft lock. Whats the point of that? If its a hero you dont want to play youll just change it. At least if it were the same as BR you would have to play say Koshka for example. A hero you might not ever play.

10928644,0,t1_de6wwl0,Hi I bought the gold sparkler Skaarf with all the other skins. I think what SEMC was trying to do was so not only do you have this limited edition skin but also a bunch of different colors of it so you can switch things up. Some games Ill put down the gold skin and play with the red one or the purple one. As a carry main most of the time I cant play skaarf since hes not really the meta right now and Im sure this is why other people dont play with him either and thus less appearances of the skin. Just my two cents though,vainglorygame,de77oc0,6,t5_32ob1
10928967,0,t3_5w4m5s,I think SEMC either has to expand the map and add more objectives lanes and jungle area which would probably make the game have to change to  v  or   v  or they can be like heroes of the storm and add more  v  maps.

Yeah maybe if you completely leave your team going  vs  and come back when your skill is up then maybe you can do some damage. But once you pop your X Retsu and Kaiten which Husk will negate you are useless for at least  seconds as you stated. Adding no damage to the team fight and adding no support to the team fight.

11295145,0,t3_617bau,Well if youre having a lot of trouble the best thing to do is to keep practicing with him if you want to learn him. That being said a few tipsMax your B first. This increases your tankiness stun duration and lowers the cool down between your stuns resulting in more CC. Right away youll probably notice a bit more success if you arent hitting As super often. Try to predict where the enemy laner is going to gowants to go. Dont Impale to them Impale to where they will be about half a second later. A decent way to practice is to go into a Blitz with Lance build like a Captain so youre tanky enough to survive if you miss and focus on hitting your Impales on moving targets. ,vainglorygame,dfcae1s,13,t5_32ob1

11316217,0,t1_dfenok9,I think Fortress is a Roam but the Roam meta is at fault. He isnt an itembearer hes a scout and aggressive initiator who protects his allies by way of slaying and sniffing out weaker oppositionCurrently the CaptainRoamwhatever has to carry all the team items. Like it would kill your Jungler andor Carry to sacrifice even one item slot for anything excluding Atlas since that is usually better than MJ. If they did sacrifice even just one item slot apiece the Captain suddenly gets two item slots. This is very basic math PIf SEMC can ever make that sort of impact in the item meta such that you dont have one player take the entire burden Fortress will instantly become an A Roam. As the meta stands now hes lacking defensive capabilities and utility meaning that he is perpetually outdone in the position by all counterparts.

11359559,0,t3_6225lh,It seems like many people are against this change. IMHO I actually am quite happy with this change. As an exclusively SoloQ player Ive had many matches where the game has snowballed out of control and we clearly have little to no chance of winning. Id much rather surrender and start another game than being FORCED to waste another  minutes because we had one try hard. Its disappointing and tilts me for other games. I can understand the potential for easy surrenders but Ive been on the other end of the barrel many times. I dont have a lot of time to play games and so being forced to play a lost cause isnt ideal. The worst part is I cant just quit because then Im penalized for going AFK. Just thought Id give a counter argument to what seems the common premise.TLDR  I actually like this change because Im tired of being forced to play lost cause matches or face punishment for quitting games.,vainglorygame,dfjl2sw,3,t5_32ob1

11520522,0,t1_dg1g9ny,It depends on the type of offense but we are often able to take action. For example verbally harassing someone is much easier because the evidence is clear so a very high percentage of harassment cases get punished if we are sent the evidence.But sometimes we get images of someone with a strange build or all deaths and no kills and it is harder to establish a basis for action since we cant be immediately sure they arent just newbad players. We have to look at past history in matches player MMR we have to look at the votes and ratings from players who had matches with this person and much more and take notes and keep track and find sufficient evidence.If I get something that says this person is a troll feeder and when I look I only see good votes and good karma and there doesnt seem to be any sort of clear evidence that they are intentionally losing then there is nothing backing up the claim of troll feeding and more likely that player is just not that good at the game. But that claim is saved and any future claims will bring up this old evidence and then a pattern starts to show.,vainglorygame,dg1upmr,2,t5_32ob1

Joule can be good if shes in lane or manages to get her items in jungle she can kill you alone during your reboot amp her perk makes her pretty tanky when engaging her head on.Her B cooldown is bugged so thats why she appears stronger right now.

Lyra used petals in my face only to run back in leading to my every death become an Ace and never bought vision. Ringo fed like crazy ava stoke my last hits.But then Lyra pressed Fountain and A Ardan talked me in Gauntlet Ringo saved me from Koshka stun and suddenly a dive worked because nobody left the arena. Ringo burnt to death but we aced and got Kraken after a long time. Event Ringo tried the most unsuccessful stall ever died horribly and Ryan over ti his depths who got aced again.Then he sold his builds and ran into the turret  times total beefier we pushed Kraken to victory just to save their team done pain. Yeah I enjoy ending my massive T listing streak but fuck him. Hes a massive pile of shit and I feel bad for poor Koshka farming our Ringo.,vainglorygame,dg77k57,1,t5_32ob1

11573821,0,t1_dg7uk5s,The problem I see with Bonesaw is that it applies a debuff to a single enemy which  you guessed it  increases your teams damage output against a single enemy. Compare that to Breaking Point which increases your personal damage against the entire enemy team.So Bonesaw is more effective when the support applies the debuff someone like Ardan for example while the carry dishes out the actual damage rather than the carry building it and sacrificing his damage output.,vainglorygame,dg7wd0x,1,t5_32ob1

We keep dying because Lyra didnt get enough fountaincruciblepauldrontreadsvision.  He probably thinks hes lt because while were dying with no support or body blocks our roam is backlining going for damagekillsorgtDude roam taka? Why is this guy throwing with no CC for Saw?

11647507,0,t1_dgg8jtd,Yes. You are a boosted noob. You should instalock SAW for your next  ranked games and buy all Tornado Triggers each game. After you reach Vainglorious Platinum uninstall Vainglory throw your phone out your window and install a real game like Mobile Legends.

11664813,0,t1_dgi76s3,Gwen is my personal priority pick too she has the best early game but Im just not sure if I should trust the statistics instead. I feel more comfortable with her guess Ill keep on.CP Glaive provides a huge amount of utility but not enough pressure right? You seem to have powerful experiences with him but I fail to experience the same.I also have excellent winrate against Alpha with Reim  but then again my Alpha vs. Reim winrate is   in  D. Ive decided Ill let those Alphas come to my Reim.Krul is easier to outplay than Skye isnt he? Neither Alpha nor Krul have good early game but Alpha should still be doing fine overall fishing the carry etc until very late so I feel Reim is still the best pick against her with his great early  good late game.And Catherine wow! Thats a lot Ive realized today.,vainglorygame,dgi7zkl,1,t5_32ob1

11708005,0,t3_672ghm,SEMC struggles in my opinion to create a hero and fit it in the meta perfectly. It is something a lot of MOBAs struggle with. If you look at the past heroes in the past year SEMC either make a very overpowered heroa very underpowered hero. Though SEMC are always good at balancingbuffing when needed  times. These are heroes when they came out stood at the certain meta in my opinion.  Alpha underpowered  Lance overpowered  Lyra overpowered  Samuel overpowered  Flicker underpowered  Baron underpowered  Idris underpowered,vainglorygame,dgn4rsu,4,t5_32ob1
