You should be able to pickup a .A or .A fast charger from any major electronics outlet I know here in NZ theyre extremely popular and Belkin .A chargers are in every electronics shop.I was lucky as Spark Telco gave me a free .A charger and  extra USBC cables with the phone.,HuaweiP9,d67775n,1,t5_3dd2q

9692094,0,t3_5du6rr,If you have to keep it for that long then Id get the Mate. Huawei claims to have used machine learning to optimize your phone according to your usage patterns so that it would not slow down after years of use. Not sure how true that is though. Also the AMOLED screen on the P might not hold up well after  years since it has an on screen navigation bar. the IPSNEO on the Mate should do just fine. Just my two cents.,HuaweiP9,da7r8e0,3,t5_3dd2q
