10478129,0,t1_dcvb5ny,Yes I am. The teacher tells you something like search for the portal vein and its branches and he leaves and gives you time to find it with your hands or utensils. I dont know it has happened to me multiple times I just see everything looking like a bunch of spaghetti xD. And taking in consideration it was an abdominal exam it was very difficult to search for the branches of things because everything had been cut to some degree for you to be able to look at the vessels with all the guts out. So for example youre asked to look for the splenic artery and the spleen is cut so you cant really go there and search it... Youd need to go to the root of the celiac artery and search from there but its... very difficult.Ill have the retake on tuesday next week and the day before we will be given the chance to look at the dog again. Any tips for making the most out of that chance Im given?EDIT THANKS for the amazing webs! You helped me a lot seriously! Btw Im watching the videos of the abdominal cavity and I seriously feel like my teachers are kind of dumb because in the videos they manage to show the vessels and keep the organs just moved to the side... Why couldnt they put it like that toooooo!EDIT Also do you have any trick to tell apart from arteries veins and nerves. Its one big problem of mine.,veterinaryprofession,dcvsyv5,1,t5_3flsd
