801098,0,t1_cgv72fl,For the first twenty minutes of my first session I felt like a ten year old kid in the playground pretending to be Bruce Lee.  Punches kicks and going Haiyah! Ok it was Kiyai but stillThe note above is really good advice.  Everyone started where you did so relax and enjoy it.  They have every reason to make you feel comfortable and no reason for you to be uncomfortable.Every dojo is different but in our dojo if a beginner does five pushups when the Sensei calls for ten he wont bat an eyelid as long as you are putting in en effort.I started karate when I was thirty kilos overweight.   In the last two years I have dropped nearly twenty kilos mainly because of karate still going.  Youll get fit along the way.  I also have better balance better posture less joint pains.,karate,cgvc6iq,2,t5_2qo6l

1211523,0,t1_ci5k37u,MMA here training in both Goju Ryu BJJ Thai Boxing etc. Mostly Karate background. Stance work is the core of everything you do even in boxing. If your stance is weak youre weak. Every stance including a horse stance has a place time and use. If youre an effective boxer you would know that the stances used in boxing are there for a reason. A proper boxing stance used across many martial arts will allow you good mobility and balance an improper stance will force you to favour a leg therefore throwing your balance off not allowing you proper use of your legs for balance and thus power. Technique creates power proper stances are the cores of a good technique. Footwork is knowing how to step into jabs how to begin and end a weave leading from one technique to another. A stance is what you ALWAYS fall back on. What comes before proper footwork? A proper stance. Break it down you need to learn to walk before you run. Sure you can dance around but what is going to stop me from running your leg through with a roundhouse kick if you dont understand what your static stance is supposed to be? Even when I studied GrecoRoman wrestling we had stances footwork coming after. True the horse stance may not be the most practical stance in the world in terms of real fighting but it does have a place especially in practical self defense where you need to lower your centre and open your opponent up. A fair example is something like this Alternatively it can also be done from the front locking the arms of an attacker whos grabbed onto you then sinking into your horse stance at a  degree angle and directing them into the ground. A more practical stance would be the Sanchin Dachi stance one of my personal favourites. Its a very basic stance that has real world applications. Its a huge go to stance for close quarters self defense and allows you to base all of your power into a very small centre. Its great for mobility redirection and technique transferring to power. It also gives you great stability. I dont want to give you shit for thinking differently but really telling people Stances doesnt matter is a bad approach. You need to learn the basics so you dont end up hurting others while training and most importantly yourself. Ive seen people come into MMA with little to no training start sparring and tear their own ACLs because they have no concept of how the human body works. If they had done some basic karate or boxing first learned proper stances and footwork it could have been avoided. tldrStances matter.,karate,ci5wxrs,9,t5_2qo6l
1218985,0,t3_281j3q,We do something similar. My sensei has one student in the middle and chooses who gets to attack. The attacker gets one attack of their choice and the person in the middle has to block whatever attack it is and follow up. Its one of my favorite sparring practices and has helped me tremendously for when I step in the ring.EDIT I forgot to add that the upper belts usually get between  attackers at a time depending on how many students show up what their skill levels are and how much time is left in class. My sensei likes to give me as many as possible because he likes to train me and pick on me a little.,karate,ci6r5qs,1,t5_2qo6l

1732093,0,t1_cjxgpu2,Curious if you are saying you dont turn your base heel or you are saying you dont pivot ON the heal.  I think the OP correct me if I am wrong is saying they have started pivoting on the heel.  This will kill a lot of your power.  Not pivoting at all unless you setup your feet would kill it to an even greater extent and risk injury to your knees I would think.  I know my old knees couldnt take it.I actually find that pivoting with the ball of my foot as the pivot point to be MORE balanced this is especially the case when you look at a fluid motion.  When you get into repetitive practice especially if it is fast paced and especially for those of us who are larger I can see how it can be hard to keep up with the inertia that you end up generating.  one reason I try to follow along when leading... nothing worse than an instructor counting so fast that it would only be possible to do  kick for every  counts unless I dog out the kicks to keep inertia under control.,karate,cjxhtsi,1,t5_2qo6l

2046724,0,t3_2i8ocz,One of my closest sparring partners was incredibly frail when he first started.  He has a unique skeletal structure that essentially makes him all sharp angles and when he started he was so thin that sitting on the floor caused his hips to dig uncomfortably into the ground.  This resulted in him working harder than any other fighter I have ever met.  He is now one of the fittest people I know and is likely slated to take over our club when the current chief instructor retires which is admittedly a ways down the line as said chief instructor just took over recently.Being frail doesnt have to turn you away.  It can be the motivation that pushes you harder than everyone else.  When you look at the professional circuit about a third of the fighters were kids who had a natural talent were bigger and stronger and loved fighting and it came to them easily and the rest were the beanpoles the weaklings the people who had to work for it and so worked harder fell in love with Karate or whatever martial art and became their potential.If you arent ready to fight for it right now then now might not be the time but I promise you that there is a fighter inside of you and there is no time like the present for pushing yourself.,karate,ckzzfif,1,t5_2qo6l
2067577,0,t3_2ibglb,One of the classes is all youth around that age and I agree with a lot of the suggestions made so far. . Use a predictable exercise and stretching routine.  That will help them get in the proper mindset..  Change what youre doing every  minutes or so.  Id recommend limiting total time an hour at most.. Break all techniques into small steps.  If you are teaching a kick the first stage would be to have your nieces bring their kneesfeet up to the proper position without kicking.  Once theyve done that a bunch then they can add in the kick.   Likewise when they learn kata add on only  moves at a time. . Focus on one mistake at a time.  Kids get overwhelmed otherwise and wont remember.  I personally try to limit corrections to  things per child each class.  For little kids thats incredibly basic stuff like using the correct hand or foot during a drill or punching with the thumb on the outside.  At that age you will have to physically move their hands for them sometimes to correct them rather than explaining a correction verbally.  . Try to talk to them at eye level when you can.,karate,cl2muxe,1,t5_2qo6l

4059611,0,t1_crj0ijt,I do okinawan goju ryu. I like to consider it as close as you can get to classical but very open to real life practice. We do our kihon kata etc. we talk bunkai  and meet up with the other clubs every quarter to talk karate and link the styles. Hawaii is just as much home to karate as Okinawa if not more so. Mcdojos fail here because of the size of the population and things dont change much theres no Japanese organization heading and trying out new things. Okinawa and Japan seem much more political andor sport based with an emphasis on masters and demonstrations to show the value. We dont compete we just practice in very small groups. Many of the senseis here trained in Okinawa because they immigrated from Okinawa. As far as I see we dont say stupid things like oss and none of that Japanese karate infiltrated into the okinawan clubs I identify as Japanese but when it comes to karate Im an oki lol. A lot of the old timers did mma before it was mma judo etc so when I did judo it was happily accepted and we do a lot to practice bunkai. We blend the throwing and grappling as discussion topics and real life simulation. However we do a good job of remembering karate is karate and not straight mma if we spar I can sweep and attempt a throw as long as I dont do it everything and dont do things that my peers arent capable of defending. Just from the comments here it seems the Hawaii clubs I work with are significantly different,karate,crj0xvw,1,t5_2qo6l
4061834,0,t3_35lnkf,Try moving the point of impact inward as in using the forearm below the wrist as opposed to the actual ridgehand.  This is reduce the leverage the bag has on your elbows.  The forearm is an underrated striking surface also IMHO excellent for close range striking from a standing grapple.Keep in mind that a heavy bag is a rather extreme surface for barehanded strikes.  Compared to a person it doesnt give very much and can transmit a lot of force back into your body.  As others have already suggested start out slow.  Work on good body mechanics and be patient for your body to adapt to the strain.,karate,crja1ee,1,t5_2qo6l

4278401,0,t3_39x4kv,Here is a bit of info that really helped me relax when it comes to sparring and just start having fun if you get to the sparring part of your grading youve already passed  of the grading. Sparring in gradings is a lot more about seeing where you are at until you get to the higher grades. Have great loud responses and give it your all! Leave nothing on the floor. So go play! Try out all the things you have been learning! As for your nervousness about sparring someone high grade... Youve got it wrong! You are generally much safer sparing a high grade over a lower grade! High grades must have developed control or they would not be high grades and are not going to wail on you like a fellow orange belt might. Low grades are dangerous because they havent developed that control yet so they sometimes make mistakes. They go to do a head level punch and didnt leave enough space and now you have a broken nose... They wanted to try and learn to sweep and messed it up because they havent learned how to safely do that yet... They get caught up in the moment and close their eyes in the middle of a round elbow strike... You get the idea. That soon to be black belt was being watched just as much if not more for how he sparred you and how much control he showed. Higher grades will strive to spar you at one grade higher than you. Sometimes someone without control manages to get through but it is the exception not the rule.So next time go have fun! Smile! Bounce around! Practice all the things you can! Sparring is heaps of fun and laughing will help you relax! ,karate,cs7w7yj,4,t5_2qo6l
4368493,0,t3_3840x6,Adding to what all the others have said. It also helps you feel the windup you need to make multiple punches.  Like our Sensei likes to tell us. To learn a movement make it big and then when you can do it big gradually make it smaller. This goes for punches blocks body movement foot movement and everything else. It is easier to exaggerate something and then refine it than it is to learn something small from the beginning. ,karate,csi2bc5,1,t5_2qo6l
4447622,0,t3_3bya1z,If you are a white belt and this all seems to be too much to learn its because it is! Karate was distributed to different countries to spread the culture of budo in Japan. Japanese is a hard language for westerners to learn and you arent expected to know much until later on so learn what you can but dont worry about everything. I think someone posted a link of general terms when you are ready watch read it. Sensei  teacher. Senpai  mentor. Dojos use the term differently. I call the head grandmaster of my association th dan sensei. I call the instructors that were his closest students   th dan sensei. I call my immediate instructors   rd dan sensei dan means level by the way so rd dan means rd degree black belt. My point is that they are all sensei to me and we have no formal difference where other schools and arts call each rank or position something different. Hanshi Shihan Soke are all high ranks. Stripes are just ranks between belts. Dont worry about them much but if you get one or two congrats! Under black belt st degree  shodan is the kyu system. There are usually  steps counting from  ju kyu  white belt to  ikkyu  whatever the highest brown belt is. A stripe can mean a full kyu step or a partial one depending. Again dont worry but thats how most places work. Youll get to shodan soon enough if you train.One term you may use and should for resect and acknowledgment is OSU! or OSS! This means train hard or train well. You should use it when sensei gives instructions and you acknowledge them as well as acknowledging your training partner before and after drills etc. So far as what you are learning karate is a three component system. It comprises of kata forms kihon basic movements and kumite sparring and partner drills. If you are doing all three you are doing karate. If you miss one piece you are not doing karate. Katas will get difficult. Some katas may seem useless and silly but if you learn them their history their meaning and their BUNKAI you will be very successful in your training. Bunkai is an often ignored part of karate these days. All katas are direct self defense drills for just about anything you could think of from multiple attackers defending against knife sword spear standing grappling and the basic movements you need to sustain a fight. Learn your katas do the drills think about what you are doing and know the movements have meaning and itll be everything you need. Just to help you no matter the system you learn you will practice kata bunkai for the rest of your life. TAKE YOUR GI HOME. WASH IT! NO EXCUSES. Dont wash your belt youll learn why later!Kiai is your spirit yell. Ki is the energy and momentum that your body creates in order to focus your energy on the strike executed. You can enhance your moves by doing this. Your kiai should be loud tense your core muscles and be comfortable to do. Your kiai sounds like you. I open my mouth and let it make the sound it makes. Easy way to make a kiai is the same as a punch or a kick find someone in class that does it the way it looks correct to you and do it the way they do. Kiai is an active part of kata make sure you do them when you are supposed to even if the room is dead silent. The bow in and bow out ceremonies vocabulary and other formalities in karate are different with style and school. You should know what they mean by the time you are a brown belt but you just have to show up and be respectful to attend class. Dont worry about them now.You sound like you are a good student of the art and already are paying attentions to details most students dont. Karate has a strange culture that once you learn it youll have it for life but its not really Japanese culture its partly budo culture its kind of become its own thing. If I wanted questions answered about BJJ I could go on this site and get pretty straightforward answers about what I should know where karate has evolved culturally but stayed the same so much so far as the art itself you might get different answers. A reverse punch is the same in all systems it is preformed the same way and will not change the name might the kata might the teacher might teach it differently. If you need to know more learn your LINEAGE early on to know exactly where you stand with the art. You should read books by Gichin Funakoshi because he has really good historical insight and facts about what role karate had in Okinawa. HOMEWORK What does the word karate mean? Empty hands is only half right! Read up and youll learn it! If you keep on going to class wash your gi do all of the kihon kata and kumite you are supposed to do and remain humble and respective not only in the dojo but outside as well youll be the perfect karate student! Keep asking questions but only when the stuff becomes tangible and relevant to you.,karate,csrb4e9,3,t5_2qo6l

The videos and this kumite are obviously only performed with limited resistance which makes perfect sense. Do you train against strong resistance from your uke?Its a criticism Id make against many traditional karate dojos that they never train against more realistic levels of resistance. Its a difficult problem nobody wants to get hurt or hurt a training partner and obviously it has to be with relevant safety precautions but without it you can still be unprepared for non compliant partners. The most egregious cases Ive seen are typically in Aikido where often students and teachers are so used to over compliant ukes they cant apply the techniques against anyone who doesnt immediately apply the breakfalls they expect.,karate,ctb5jzh,5,t5_2qo6l
4641753,0,t3_3ejs9w,It all depends on the instructor. Of course there are dozens and dozens of lock and throws that could be applied in bunkai.

In the meantime you get a load of bollocks talked about things like linear karate or circular karate and all the rest by people who dont have a real understanding of what theyre talking about.There really is only karate.

4856787,0,t3_3hc7zs,I agree with what others are saying in that despite the drills being the same as what a  year old girl practices the depth of understanding should be vastly different and therefore although you are both practicing the same techniques I would hope that the training focus on those techniques would be worlds different.  Having said that Im quite shocked to hear that your Kyokushin dojo has very little kumite practice.  If the instructor and his wife are indeed your friends you should be able to confide in them your concerns with the class specifically the lack of sparring and self defense training.  They are running a business but Kyokushin has a reputation of being a hard style with lots of contact and it seems like they are more interested in catering to the comforts of little Billy and his mom than upholding the reputation of a typical Kyokushin dojo.  If they arent willing to change then I wouldnt bother investing any more of your time there.  Its nothing personal. Its just that you are following a different path on your martial arts journey.  I would first recommend finding another Kyokushin dojo that is more aligned with your needs.  If that isnt a possibility I suggest you just start something else.

No usually people stick with the style from the start through to black belt but its not really required. There is no overarching organisation which manages this stuff.. Its just one school there are probably lots and they are probably not affiliated with each other. The major styles include shotokan shorinryu wadoryu shitoryu gojuryu and uechiryu. The style itself is relatively unimportant its more important to find a good teacher and this is a problem.. No. People start karate for all sorts of reasons at all ages and there are often beginner classes.What are you looking for from karate? If its fitness martial art skills sport then Id say yes it can be a good choice. It its for self defence then the unfortunate truth is that today the quality of teaching is on average fairly poor and you would probably be better looking at Japanese JuJutsu instead. e.g. Think of the sport of fencing.

5818103,0,t3_3ut79y,gt I could not believe the instructor was going to teach knee strikes I had no idea this was allowed in this martial art.Im sorry but you dont know what a martial art is. This is because you come from a background of combat sports. Combat sports are sports that resemble a fight to various degrees. They must have rules because without rules your competitors cant compete without careerending injuries happening to them on day one. A martial art is different than a combat sport. A martial art is a set of techniques and principles intended for combat. There are inherently no rules at all. Now martial arts will often have training exercises with more restrictive rule sets because people have to survive them. But the overall goal of training is different. In a combat sport the overall goal of training is to defeat another athlete in a preplanned contest which both fighters are prepared for in such a way as to leave him without permanent damage. In a martial art the goal of training is to prepare you to survive a sudden attack by a person who wants to hurt you using any means necessary including killing them stone dead if possible. So yes knee strikes are allowed. So are eye gouges attacks to the genitals and shooting the opponent with a  caliber semiautomatic pistol. Now each of these two things martial arts and combat sports have a problem specific to them that can render them ineffective. With martial arts that problem is lack of quality control. Since techniques intended to be lethal or which are simply difficult to control into not inflicting serious injury cannot be tested martial arts often under utilize stress testing resulting in someone who can go through the motions but not fight. Example McDojos everywhere. Child black belts. George Dillman.With combat sports the problem is training distortion. Since the goal is to win a rulerestricted contest athletes often overoptimize for that rule set resulting in serious deficits in their responses to a freeform threat. Example Boxers holding their guard too high. Kyokushin fighters holding their guard too low. MMA fighters unable to handle multiple threats. BJJ players getting stabbed. ,karate,cxiagdd,5,t5_2qo6l

If you want to do it for sport no problem there are loads of those it absolutely will get you fit and it wont really matter which one you choose. just remember not much of it will be applicable in a pub or on a street.If you want self defence then look elsewhere the statistics are better. For more practical stuff in any martial art you could have a look here ,karate,cyvvdkc,1,t5_2qo6l

6380369,0,t3_431syi,This seems a little odd to me.  And over exaggeratebe loud is very poor advice and holds no value or merit. Anyways. Its kind of tough to give advice here. But Id start by looking at your bunkai for the Kata you currently practice. Since hes saying to come up with it Im assuming you cant perform it verbatim. Once you find  techniques to work from your bunkai try and find some variations. I seem to reference him a lot but Iain Abernethy on YouTube may be able to get your mind going a bit to start thinking of variations of your current movements. ,karate,czevoig,4,t5_2qo6l

You can get fairly smooth results with regular cement so long as your mold is smooth on the inside and you vibrate the cement to get air bubbles out. To get it any smoother youll have to buff it with a powered buffing wheel. As nice as it may look thats not really the point of chiishi.One solution Id seen for cracking was to put a layer of water over the top of the cement while it sets but I still ended up with a small crack. That said Ive only ever had one chiishi break and that was because I messed up and tried removing it from the mold before it had completely set.,karate,d0lb974,1,t5_2qo6l

7892724,0,t3_4ne4g8,I think it comes down to what you value and how you define your terms. I see that both of the responses given so far are emphasizing the mentalspiritual aspect and really thats pretty admirable!Im going to focus more on the physical aspect. If someone has good strength good flexibility good techniques that produce focused power in a controlled and efficient way and enough mental conditioning to use all of the above in a chaotic situation then theyre a good karateka.But let me also add that its possible to be a good karateka qua karateka while still being a doofus or ahole. So maybe we can say that an ideal karateka is both a good karateka and a good person.  ,karate,d437s2j,3,t5_2qo6l

7925310,0,t3_4ngm9z,My fist german teacher used to say three things after a doing a kataFirst Yame  We cross our arms and go back to Hachiji Dachi. I never knew the name of this stance. He just called it Shizentai and the commands to go into it were Yoi and Yame.then Rei and then also Naore.So Naore wasnt the same thing as Yame.He didnt tell us what it means or I wasnt there when he explained it. Then I thought he said Na... Okay. My goal was to someday get him to say Good! instead of just Okay  .I think it actually meant we could return to an actual natural stance not like Shizentai with Zanshin  what kids do anyway if you leave them in a stance more than three seconds.Maybe Zanshin is a difference for some teachers between Shizentai and Hachiji Dachi like Shizentai is a certain Kamae.,karate,d46vor2,1,t5_2qo6l

8378022,0,t3_4ucb6v,I felt like I was the shit when I got my st dan however my sensei smacked me upside the head and told me that my Karate starts now. He explained to me that the colored belts white to however many stripes on brown were only a foundation. That black belt is like starting from white belt again a whole new world is opened up and that youre only a beginner again. From that day onward me and him have been training once a week alone separate from the group classes and have been working on my forms improving them and training and soon. years down the road from that day and I refuse to go up in rank simply because there is so much to learn at st Dan itself. All of my forms and techniques that I thought I had perfected before I was tested for my st Dan were still very rough once I started training oneonone with my sensei. I see the purpose of nearly every movement the application of said movement how the  body reacts to different strikes how to manipulate several forms and Kata to real life and etc.Bottom line is that your Karate really starts now tbh. And I feel as though you should build up your base some more before you start exploring other martial arts. Which is currently what Im doing because I really want to get into the other forms of Karate such as GojuRyu and Kyoushin alongside completely different styles such as Kungfu and Aikido.But hey whatever floats your boat man! Just make sure not to get rusty on any of the stuff that you have already learned.,karate,d5osvfx,7,t5_2qo6l

So its also a matter of spending more time on kicking to the detriment of other things which isnt horrible in the sense that it can be rectified but I think it has a fair amount to do with the time invested in improving your dexterity and technique specifically for kicking more so than anything else.,karate,dangf94,1,t5_2qo6l

10003565,0,t1_dbaqa0g,Was trying to figure that out to.  I think he shifted into striking distance and took the safety from the center so he had to react.  When attacker drops into stance and shifts forward a little defender mirrors him and drops down as well.  If you watch it a few times you see after the initial move his energy drop and his stance relax  come up and you see at the same time his face slackens  hes already reacted to what happened and is just processing now with the guy.  Defender was square and flat footed though highlights the pressure for defender.  If he was in fighting stance would have a smaller effect I imagine.I think the attacker showed that he stimulated a defense motion just by shifting a little in to an aggressive stance by a few inches with his hip and it forced the defender to give his center.  He doesnt break his form or posture but he is pulling back a little.  If attacker had given that brief pause then initiated the movement and the reaction it caused might open up all the stutter hed need to catch the defender in kyo.My interpretation be glad if someone offers a better one ,karate,dbbhrl4,2,t5_2qo6l

10409412,0,t3_5p27lm,I really wanted to recommend you to Taekwondo because all this jumping isnt really Karate and they know more about this and can help you with jump kicks. However then I saw your post history and saw that you not only got already good advice from the people there but also that you got no instructor and want to create your own style. I just want to tell you that this wont work out well. First you need to learn a style very well before you can even think about changing it much let alone create something new. If you only do Kicks which look cool and even that without proper instructions you wont be able to use it for self defence and might even hurt yourself with bad execution of techniques. ,karate,dcnz3fi,15,t5_2qo6l

11002389,0,t3_5x3tri,YouTube can be a great resource for Karate but sadly not for a beginner. To see the difference between something which works and is beneficial and something which is just some fancy moves without value you need a very good foundation which you only get by training in a Dojo. However even if we show you good channels like the one of Ian Abernathy or the Waza Wednesday Videos which are posted in this sub reddit it wouldnt help you either. YouTube can only be an addition to get new ideas and can never replace training in a Dojo. First of all you dont know which details of a technique are the important ones for a beginner and which part of the movement is something you will only master after several years of hard work. Furthermore you need the feedback of a Sensei to show you where your mistakes are. Some mistakes are common and are very likely done by every beginner so we could tell what you will most likely do wrong but some are individual and can only be corrected by a Sensei. Tldr You will do yourself more harm than good by learning from YouTube with most likely missing out on important details which you can only learn by a Sensei. Leave YouTube for later. ,karate,def37bw,7,t5_2qo6l
