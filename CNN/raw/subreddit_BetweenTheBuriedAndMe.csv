253063,0,t1_cf6zatv,I think most of it is due to the fact that the album that sold me was the Great Misdirect. So much going on in that album that I fell in love with that style. I still love Parallax but for me it just doesnt at any point make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I have one friend who still loves that record the most.

1899769,0,t1_cki3cr7,I feel exactly this way about The Great Misdirect Swim to the Moon needs about five minutes cut but the opposite about The Parallax. I think both Parallaxs are wellwritten and dont meander except maybe SFP. I think Melting City is their best written song in the Colors era. Most of the songs on P are ten minutes or so Telos Melting City and EE are all around ten minutes long. Im surprised you dont like Melting City but would give songs like Obfuscation and Swim to the Moon a pass. I feel you on the preColors albums. I dont know why people dont like the first album outside of the production it fits completely in with their current sound. Alaska has some great songs. Id love for a band to have that Silent Circus sound. There are still heavy parts all around. Telos is aggressive as shit. That Melting City breakdown. Lay Your Ghosts to rest has that awesome section from about  minutes to seven minutes after the first chorus and into the slow section.Maybe the band isnt for you anymore. That always sucks to have happen but it does. Green Day used to be my favorite band and now I barely listen to them even more. And when I listen to the radio Ill skip their songs and just channel surf even though I like the song thats on. It sucks but it happens.Maybe you should go into the album with open ears. It might not be what you want to hear from this band but it still might be a solid album. ,BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,cki40wg,2,t5_2sf49

4356658,0,t3_3av34v,I really enjoy the album but it definitely feels like it was a rushed effort by the band.

4423558,0,t1_csnz84h,I dont think it makes a difference to the bands bottom line. I cant imagine a scenario where someone who was planning on buying the album instead of torrenting it would download a leak and then refuse to buy the album so I agree with you that theres probably not a noticeable difference to the bands revenue. But I think it does make a difference in principle and in sentiment.In principle you are paying for an album that is slated for release on a certain date. Those are the terms of the agreement. That is what you paid for. End of story. By acquiring a free copy early you are subverting that agreement. I consider myself beholden to the terms of my payment if you dont choose to respect yours so be it.In sentiment I deeply respect BTBAM. They collaborated with Metal Blade to settle on a release date. That is the release date that they endorse. If they wanted to release it as soon as it was done on a paywhatyouwant basis they would have done that. Instead they choose this means of release on this date. I respect them so I respect that release date. I choose not to let the decision of some employee at some music publication to leak the album usurp the decision of the band. If youre not moved by any of that then I dont think theres much I can say to sway you. Its like I said before nothing about the fact that some person unaffiliated with BTBAM chose to leak the album presumably against their will makes it okay to suddenly listen to it early. Its just suddenly more convenient and apparently much easier to rationalize.,BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,csoa7a3,1,t5_2sf49

8539139,0,t1_d68gtas,I dont know if I agree with you or not Its definitely not my favorite record from them. Its still perfectly good though I thought there were too many slower songs and there wasnt as much intensity as Parallax  where nearly every song had a really solid intense moment if not more. I just hope they balance that out the record was still great in a prog sense but it needed more metal imo. I am fine with whatever they put out next but I find myself revisiting Parallax  these days and even though there was less variety there it was good and intense because BTBAM knew what they were doing there. This album had great tracks that werent metal at all or got the balance right like Node but there were more songs where it was basically hard rock or just left me impartial about them.

That way  BTBAM would feel good still working with King and we would get the amazing engineering skills of Botrill.  The drums on that EP are so amazing sounding and really shine when you listen to them on vinyl or a high end system.  The way they sound organic and natural but HUGE that snare  all at the same time I can actually hear them breathe damn its awesome.  The way Jamie records Blakes drums just seems to drain all of the dynamics out and have a super reinforced sound that works but I just wish they didnt sound very close to triggers.  They actually sound thinner on high end systems because of all the unnatural eqing and very thin on vinyl where they should really open up.  ,BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,df87pdr,6,t5_2sf49
