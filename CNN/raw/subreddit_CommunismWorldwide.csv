4499041,0,t3_3cpbv1,gt So why the push to go to college and be a mindless debtslave indoctrinated with consumerist ideology from those supposedly smarter than I or my comrades?For starters Im not a lifestylist anarchist. Most importantly though its in my best interest to do so.gt Why are people so ignorant of the conditions that they were afforded to be in a certain position?For the same reason you ignorantly dismiss hard work completely. Too blinded by ideology to see the world as it really is.No one ever fell out of bed and got a MD because they had rich parents. Do people who become doctors have advantages? Of course but that doesnt mean they didnt also work hard and apply themselves.gt Should I attend college and be indebted?Thats for you to decide but it doesnt sound to me like youd get the most out of it.,CommunismWorldwide,csxrbtb,3,t5_35g1v

5385257,0,t3_3oruax,Destroying the state but leaving capitalism intact would spell out nothing but disaster for the working peoples of this earth.Lets look at what would happen if we got rid of the state or at the very least made it extremely ineffectual but left capitalism intact.Now since theres no police force to protect private property what would the stateless capitalists use to protect their businesses? They would most likely hire private security forces correct?Now because these businesses have no laws besides contracts made by individuals what would stop these capitalists from paying wages so low they could barely sustain the population? And furthermore who would stop them from using their private security forces from beating and jailing workers that attempted to unionize?These companies would also no longer be subject to antitrust laws. Why compete with your business rivals when you can just merge the companies into one giant mass? After all that means more cash for everyone involved right?Soon youd find these companies claiming turf for themselves. All the business conducted in one area would be agreed to be run by a singular company. Anyone who disagreed would either be bought out or killed by the private security forces.What you have now are companies becoming states but not the liberal states that were accustomed to. No theyre something much worse. Youd basically be creating a postindustrial version of feudal europe with a mcdonalds logo on it.So no thanks.

6485332,0,t1_czq2gj2,It could be my ignorance of intersectional theory but Im not aware of intersectionality directly addressing this problem entirely either.  It correctly acknowledges that all oppression is interwoven but doesnt ground this connection in how society reproduces itself like non classessentialist Marxism does.In other words as I understand intersectionality its possible to be intersectional and still make the original mistake referred to by OXIO in which class race and sex are thought of as only or even primarily social categories rather than as justifications for the reproduction of the underlying material relations.  Justifications which can mutate and have done in response to criticism while the underlying oppression remains unchallenged and unchanged.,CommunismWorldwide,czq4qrk,1,t5_35g1v

7025377,0,t3_4bl0ak,Im so sorry so few people have gotten around to replying to this post. Im glad I have a relative opportunity to do so.Your realization of the harrowing character of capitalism at this point in your life is going to help you greatly in your intellectual developments as it may have done for many of our comrades who began their understanding and studies of communism at earlier ages than mostmyself included.However yes many of us have gotten to the point of great anger and endless depression in this lack of fruition to the developments of class consciousness in the many people who we are surrounded by and for this there is as I see it little more we can do than to continue in our studies and attempts at engagement with those who might put us down and so on.In terms of the endlessness of analysis of various works dont take this as a negative. While you might find it annoying or otherwise bothersome this is largely expanding your thought process and helping your mind wrap around the fact that capitalism is a contradictory system of economy produced in condition by the thousands of years of developments and revolutions in the means modes and organizations of production in such a way as to lead to economic globalization through market developments in themselves and so on.In other words yesyou may be rendered depressed and angry by your solitude in thinking and perhaps so in analyzing every little thing you come to encounter but think of this more as a means to which you develop your intellect instead of a hindrance. Who knows? You could end up a greater philosophic thinker than most in the fields of Marxism. You just need time.I hope whatever advice I might have come to offer could help. Im sorry if I havent offered anything of solace to you.,CommunismWorldwide,d1cogp9,2,t5_35g1v
