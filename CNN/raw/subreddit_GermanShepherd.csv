3189497,0,t1_cosfwvk,Youre welcome! Shes so much fun! My GSD is mixed with Belgian Malinois so her shed is more gradual and year round. I just have to vacuum real well every weekend not too bad. As far as the breed just keep them active so they dont get bored and destructive. Theyre an awesome companion when doing things outdoors.,GermanShepherd,coslanc,2,t5_2u61c
3228676,0,t3_2x3x3w,Please do not look at the price per bag look at the price per day! Look at the daily recommended amount calculate how many days you can do with one bag total weight of the bag divided by weight per day and then divide the price by the amount of days. Ive done this calculation a bunch of times and its not strange to find that you can do about the same amount of time with a kg bag of great food as a kg bag of mediocre food. This is because the cheaper you go the more fillers are in it. The price per day brings the costs more in perspective maybe even more if you calculate the price per month from that. That said how much you feed per day can be very different from what the bag says so this method isnt completely accurate it just shows you a bit more about what the ACTUAL price difference is.,GermanShepherd,cownnu3,2,t5_2u61c
