10855330,0,t3_5v4c7r,I am not a lawyer but the project license is pretty scary and the project itself is not open source.Since youre restricting the ability to sell the game it is violating the open source definition specifically rule one.The scary part comes from the ambiguity similar to how the JSON license was declared dangerous some time ago a line of the license to Isleward readsgt  You cant create mods addons content or tools that are illegal or offensive.The matching line in the JSON license in comparison readgt The Software shall be used for Good not Evil.What is offensive good or evil is very subjective making both licenses dangerous to publish software under.gt You cant distribute hacked versions of the game or source.What is your definition of hack? Some people define hackers as security breachers which other people define as crackers. Some people define hackers as playful clever people to those people a hack could possibly include making some board gameesque version which could be violating this license dependent on definition.gt You cant distribute mods addons content or tools that would cause players to be hacked either ingame or out of game.This line of the license is also pretty scary.If the definition of hacking is security breaching social engineering is a part of that. Making any kind of content that could be used for social engineering is prohibited by this line.Additionally Id also be scared to publish anything since some kinds of vurnabilities would be violating this license from what I could see.Id recommend you to use an existing widely used license. The start of the license made me think it would be something similar to the GNU GPL but it ultimately is not open source at all with a dangerous license.Alternatively you should either go permissive as in a you can do whatever with this license such as MIT or have some safeguard to keep additions to the same license as copyleft licenses do because it feels like people can easily redistribute the project under a different license to circumvent everything youve written up.Id also prefer if you didnt unintentionally? mislead people by calling your project open source when its not that term has requirements very similar to the requirements to be freelibre software and a lot of people will assume the project fulfills these requirements when its called open source.Aside from the license problems however as a roguelike fan the project looks pretty cool and interesting.  ,isleward,ddznfg4,2,t5_3df76
