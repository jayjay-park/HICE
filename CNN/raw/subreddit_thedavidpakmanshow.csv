331814,0,t1_cfeaprh,Im glad you capitalized our experience because its a very important caveat to what youre proposing. I was born and raised in NY where as you know most of us vote towards the left if we vote at all including those of us who arent remotely familiar with the issues or candidates beyond the D next to their names and I promise you that what you have experienced is only one side of a coin. The very nature of your show guarantees an imbalance of the type of feedback your going to receive. Im sure Rush Limbaugh has a pretty big box of stuff that would resemble Hatriot Mail if we got to peek at it. Our side of the political fence doesnt tend to try to get the voter base frothing at the mouth over every single issue guns Benghazi fake scandals Obamacare etc. the way the right does but Im confident that such a stash of letter exists nonetheless. There have been moments where some of the comments regarding the spelling andor grammar made me glad that I wasnt listening to or watching the show around certain peers as Im sure they might be embarrassed to hear the ridicule even if they wouldnt say so out loud. Im not saying that it needs to be ignored completely but to emphasize it isnt especially helpful and it hits all the wrong points in proving why the letter being read is asinine. Often times you wont even criticize the content of the letter at all since it speaks for itself but you do mention the spelling. I just feel like its something you guys might want to be aware of.

3061755,0,t3_2v31lo,I took a quick glance at this thread so much misinformation that its hard to really go through everything.For example the suicide rate thing as a mens issue lots of data debunking thatWomen attempt suicide three times as often as men but dont succeed as frequently. Researchers have found that gender differences in socialization is the strongest explanation for mens relative success in suicide attempts. In the United States for instance it has been shown that unsuccessful suicide attempts are considered feminine while it is considered masculine to succeed. In other words the fear of being labeled feminine or weak in a male supremacist culture encourages men to ensure their attempts are successfully completed. The statistic given here also masks that many of these suicides were actually murdersuicides. In the United States an estimated  to  people died in suicide attacks each year.More than ninety percent of the offenders are men nearly all the victims are female.Life expectancy was mentionedIf women live seven years longer than men it should be obvious why they receive more health support because the oldest people in society are those that most need subsidized health support and the oldest people are predominantly women. Furthermore the insurance industry charges  billion a year more to women in health insurance each year for the same coverage plans men receive  and up to  more for the same individual coverage plan  despite womens overall better health and despite receiving  less income then men. On the child custody goes to women and its unfair part of the time custody is agreed upon or settled by parents themselves usually without outside mediation. Mothers are more likely to receive custody because both parents usually understand that it is in the best interests of their children. In married twopartner households women spend nearly twice as much time doing child care as their male partners. Only  of custody cases go to trial and only . are resolved there.  In disputed custody cases fathers win custody  of the time  despite abusive men being among those most likely to fight for custody.Much like with libertarianism lots of people around MRA fall for seemingly simple explanations without actually looking deeper.,thedavidpakmanshow,cofcjcf,7,t5_30b6q

I had some very direct criticisms of Dr. Saads analysis and thought that that thread about his interview might be appropriate but I may just create a thread with a more pointed and specific thrust to articulate my view of what I see as a growing problem in our mostly internet discourse. What I will say now though and Ive hinted at it already is that phenomena such as people who take the defense of the lifestyle of others past the point of reason as well as gender inequities that negatively effect men would both be best discussed without the waving of any banners above them. These labels overemphasize particular social dynamics and the importance that they have in our society to the point where the discussions around them themselves are a problem.

9320723,0,t1_d8n049h,gtFirst his comments were complete locker room talk. Anyone who says men never talk like that is naive or intentionally lying. While I wouldnt be surprised if Trump did rape someone when I hear grab them by the p I do not think hes talking about rape. I think hes talking about being aggressive which is not rape.Am a guy have never talked like that.  Locker room talk to me is Hey look at her.  Id like to fuck her.  Id like to do all sorts of dirty things with her but its never been under the pretense that it was against her will.  This is vastly different than saying When youre a celebrity you can do anything or I just start kissing them.  I dont even wait.  Theres a clear difference between fantasizing about fucking a woman and suggesting that you will be aggressive with her.  The latter is repugnant and if you have thought that in the past you are also repugnant.gtThe media wants to make up rules concerning the Clintons scandalous past. Specifically you cant bring it up and if you do youre being sexist.I dont necessarily think this is the case.  Shes got one of the lowest approval ratings of any candidate in history.  Obviously people speak poorly of her freely.  Head on over to rthedonald if you want your safe space.gtShe involved herself went on national TV and called her husbands accusers liars and insulted their intelligence.Which isnt nearly as bad as calling Mexicans rapists and wanting to build a wall to keep them out or calling blacks lazy and refusing to rent to them or talking about your projections of your  year old daughters tits or saying youd date your other daughter if she werent related and calling her a piece of ass or suggesting that the election is rigged already what a graceful loser he is or suggesting that global warming is a chinese hoax or that hed repeal the Paris treaty or that he would consider defaulting on the national debt or that he wants every country to have nukes or that he considered blowing boats out of the water for giving US ships the middle finger or having am twitter rants about a former pageant winner who you called fat  years ago or just being a thinskinned prick in general.gtBoth candidates are terrible. And this is the result.They are and in pretty much any other election your claims about HRC would probably be met with less criticism.  However shes clearly the superior candidate when you combine his brash egotism sexism racism unpredictability and sheer lack of policy understanding.

Because if so thats me since I talk to them every day review papers by other academics and go to conferences often.Im happy to explain. The experiences youre citing as evidence are limited to your personal experience of the conversations youve had  or allegedly had.gtI love the logic loops you attempt to create that come to the fact that anyone can be biased.... very deep!Since we are sharing our emotions. I find it frustrating that you insert your personal feelings while simultaneously attempting to convey that you value truth.gtAnd yes you did to appeal to his authority as a worldrenowned authorHe is world renown author neuroscience and is considered enough of an authority of geopolitics religion and philosophy that he is regularly invited to speak at universities news programs debates etc. The claim that at his base he is illogical is an extraordinary claim that you have to defend.Im glad that this point youre intuitively recognizing that you likely did not understand what you read. Sadly you were correct. I pointed to SEVERAL data points as evidence that Sam is widely considered an authority not the authority. You polarized my argument to position it as he is the authority and also only included one variable World renown author. Very dishonest.gtAnd heres a big problem that you havent seemed to grasp... is that criticizing the ideas that a person believes is in fact often equivalent to criticizing that person.If someone attaches themselves to the characters in a book  that is a societal problem. We do do not grant exceptions for any other book or religion. You can go on TV and say Jesus was a piece of shit homo who deserved to get nailed to a cross and youll get a lot of hate mail. If you do this about Mohamed even if youre a multimillionaire you should legitimately fear for your life. Free speech has to win. We have to be able to criticize books and ideas. If you personally attach yourself to that book  that is a problem. Its a book.gtIf you dont believe that let me take you down a logic adventure. Sam Harris has said repeatedly he doesnt respect Donald Trump. In most peoples minds thats an insult. He said this long before the accusations of sexual came out. So what was he basing his criticism on? The ideas Donald Trump supported and how he voiced that support.Again youve misscharacterized my position and its left you rightly confused. Criticizing a belief is one thing and a person is another entirely. Now at any point did I say that if you criticize a belief or beliefs you cannot therefore use the criticisms of what those people belive to make judgement on how they will act intelligence etc. Of course you can rightly do that. If I tell you that I believe driving into a wall with my car is a great idea especially when there are passengers in it youd be right to not want to drive with. Now under your logic if I said Listen driving into walls is not safe Id therefore be insulting the person who likes to drive into walls. They may FEEL insulted but that is because they have attached themselves to idea that driving into walls is a good idea and they now feel patriotic to that idea.gtSo you cant really get away it by throwing up your hands and saying I criticize ideas I dont criticize people. Life just isnt that simple. Although it may be in Sam Harris mind because he tends to use that defense often even though he doesnt really believe it.Yes you absolutely can. People deserve respect. Ideas do not deserve respect they deserve to be shred into pieces until all that is left is that which is true. If you believed the nonsense about respecting beliefs than you also believe that youre personally insulting me right now when you criticize my position on Harris. I do not feel insulted by you because I dont have any patriotic attachments to ideas.  ,thedavidpakmanshow,d9zfqjl,1,t5_30b6q

The Fed saved banks by supplying unlimited liquidity and rolling over loans.Japanese bond rates are negative the government gets paid to borrow. Traders are making money on basis swaps. See Snider Everywhere you look theres a dollar shortagegt The negative yen basis swap acts like leverage where even yields on the interim investment are negative. Any speculator or bank with spare dollars could lend them in a yen basis swap meaning an exchange into yen. Because you end up with yen you are forced into some really bad investment choices such as slightly negative year government bonds but that is just part of the cost of keeping risk on your yen side low.

11234538,0,t3_608kad,This video title is actually very revealing. It goes to show that even supporters of Israel realize how triggerhappy the IDF is. If you honestly think that letting your child walk near Israeli soldiers and telling the soldiers to kill him somehow poses a threat to the child then you are really saying something about those Israeli soldiers.,thedavidpakmanshow,df5f41c,2,t5_30b6q

11292019,0,t3_61471d,I would suggest this economic effect is hard to quantify.We can easily calculate how much a person hrsweek  hr will make any given year but we cant quantify how much extra such a person will consume in welfare. It will be also very hard to compute an impact on a single person as a taxpayer since taxes are progressive in US.It is just very hard to back your claim with an actual statistics.,thedavidpakmanshow,dfbxn2p,1,t5_30b6q

11422699,0,t1_dfqmaq7,gtbut the reality is the town hall attendees likely were a big part of the AHCA crashingHow is that the reality? There are many reasons as to what led to the failure of that bill to pass the least of them being those Town Halls constituents accost elected representatives birddogging I think its called. The reality is the bill failed to pass because the Republicans were split about it. And they werent split about it because some people had yelled at some of them at Town Halls they were split because some of them e.g. Freedom Caucus and the libertarians like Rand Paul wanted Obamacare repealed in its entirety  no replacement a return to the status quo ante and others wanted a severely watered down version of Obamacare for the backlash theyd face from constituents of theirs that rely on Obamacare. I think you are severely overestimating the impacts of those Town Halls which have now become largely a forum for people to yell at politicians.,thedavidpakmanshow,dfqr28g,1,t5_30b6q
11442284,0,t1_dfsy2nd,Its hard to say because many of the countries have their own issues outside of whatever US intervention occurs.

11696956,0,t1_dgls8t3,Child pornography is a violation of childs rights. It is not a free speech issue. The only reason we object child pornography is that we object the violence against children that is most certainly committed. We dont object pornography we object hurting people.For the same reason we will object publication of raw footage of rapes of adult individuals or actual torture. Though we have no objections of publications of footage of staged rapes or fights.Should we allowed to talk about child porn? Yes.Nuclear device? This is outdated. The knowledge is out there.
