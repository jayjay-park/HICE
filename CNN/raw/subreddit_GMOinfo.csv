5593343,0,t1_cwqaff0,beermnkey of gmomyths and skeptic who has never posted any useful food or science info to GMOinfo saysgt But how can anybody tell what in the organic aisle has chemical mutagenic andor nuclear mutagenic food in it? This stuff is way way less tested than GMOs and far far more random in terms of what accidental traits have been expressed. Answer Nobody can. And nobody cares.Organic is more thoroughly tested than nonorganic food so the probability that you are eating chemical or nuclear mutated food is virtually none with rorganic.  Despite you trying to use a vague reference to something like the Suns radiation without realizing the only comparable realworld thing youre describing is mutated plants and animals of humangenerated chemicalnuclear contamination I understand that youve been subjected to rMonsanto propaganda and rKevinFolta type education so that the best you can do is to ask nonsense.  As a result youve been provided a timeout to catchup on needed reading from approved submissions from the informed sources that submit here in rGMOinfo.,GMOinfo,cwqeneu,1,t5_2yaqn
