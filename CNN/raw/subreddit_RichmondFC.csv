6559639,0,t1_czx8k7r,He got a little mention on the Richmond website reportgt Sparked into action by Jacob Townsend and Anthony Miles roving to Ben Griffiths around the ground at the beginning of the match the two former GWS players drifted forward and were rewarded with the opening two Black goals of the game. In promising signs the Tigers top draft pick from last year Daniel Rioli was involved in the buildup of both goals.,RichmondFC,czxtkg6,2,t5_2w3wl
7091690,0,t1_d1k7jf2,He was underdone in preseason but he musnt have played well enough in the VFL last week if they arent picking him now.,RichmondFC,d1k7n0l,1,t5_2w3wl
7136049,0,t3_4d8r3q,Can I just close my eyes and have Yaz Lids Ivan Grimes Titch and Conca in when I open them again please?If not then lets drop Hunt give CEllis some VFL time and bring in some proven ball winners. Youd hope Edwards and Maric come in and Batchelor for Grimes maybe give Broad a go over playing Hunt again his game was disgusting.,RichmondFC,d1pagwc,2,t5_2w3wl
7434339,0,t3_4h46dt,I could write an essay on how empty I feel and how depressed this football club makes me but theres no point. Positives weve got a few so lets focus on them. I only saw the came from like some way through the third but Ill comment on what I saw namely individual performances. Brett Deledio is back. Praise be. Hes not the messiah but good lord does that gorgeous man help us look like less of a basket case. Jack Riewoldt is amazing. Didnt have his best night but the man bleeds for the club and thats clearly a rarity. Steven Morris is not a very talented footballer but the lad has heart which is more than can be said for a good portion of his teammates.  David Astbury is a gun. I dont care what anyone else says I love him so much and Im glad hes got a place in the side. Shaun Hampson looks like our number one ruckman now. Ivan is majestic and I love him to bits but the guy looked well and truly cooked. Is he too old and too slow? Maybe. I rate Hampsons ruck work so I kinda hope he can improve his work around the ground and become a more complete player. Jason George Costanza Castagna was decent on debut hell get better with experience and more games under his belt Ive seen worse debuts. Shaun Grigg. A guy I was kinda skeptical about when he joined the club but his past  months have been phenomenal. Found a new gear and career best form. If can play every game like he did this one Id sign him on for as long as he wants to carry on. Dustin Martin had his best game of the season imo more of those please.Edit th loss in a row and yet Im not feeling it. Maybe its because I didnt watch the game or the full game like I have been able to in recent weeks. Maybe Im officially numb to the pain of losing thanks to everything weve experienced this year and in years gone past but as uBergasms said might as well focus on the positives even if we collectively wanna cry an ocean or twenty.,RichmondFC,d2n8jhs,6,t5_2w3wl

7620437,0,t3_4jozsf,Damn thats a blow. Despite disposal inconsistencies Houlis become a really valuable player across halfback and will be missed. Hopefully Yarran can get on the park soon or someone else steps up. Rance can be a great rebounding defender but without McIntosh and Houli there to assist the backline is in trouble and theyll struggle to get the ball forward of center more than usual. ,RichmondFC,d38ejwv,1,t5_2w3wl
9072529,0,t1_d82cwcn,hope not but we are definitely getting a few people who have been through that system.,RichmondFC,d82dcwo,1,t5_2w3wl
9339601,0,t3_58er1h,This has been a great trade period. We needed inside mids to help Cotchin and Martin since  saw Miles drop in form. We got Prestia and Caddy who are both strong inside mids with a lot of potential.Caddy can also play as a FwdMid which will help fill the hole left in our forward line with Deledio leaving.The only reason this isnt  is I still think we need another target up forward to help Jack. Griffiths is still yet to play consistently at a level that is worthy of best . I am glad we were able to pick up a backup ruckman we needed this badly incase of injury to Hampson but would have been much happier if we were able to get a FwdRuck rather than a pure tap ruckman in Nankervis.Heres hoping that Geelong are the Fremantle of  and we end up with a top  pick for Deledio!,RichmondFC,d8zv20i,10,t5_2w3wl
