3238831,0,t3_2x79j4,I am sorry I am not really sure I understand your problem...It works exactly as described in those docs. So maybe there is really a good chance that you distro butchered kdevelop somehow and didnt install some needed dependencies. But here the steps I have to take First MenugtRungtConfigure Launches to bring up the settings dialog for executing your programs. Maybe not necessary if there is already a launcher for the executable you want to debug Select the project to the left of the Launch Configuration Dialog and then click the  Add New button at the top and add a new Compiled Binary     That adds a new launcher for a executable created by your project to the list in the left. By selecting that launcher you can change what binary file get executed if you want it run in a shell what environment variables should be set for it... If its one created by cmake rules most likely no setup needed at all other than selecting the build target at the top It also creates a sub item for the new launcher called debug on the left. If you select that one you can change the debug options. Again most likely wont need to change much there if you use gdb.    Once you have your launcher you can select which executable you work on in MenugtRungtCurrent Launch Configurationgt... Very useful if your project creates more than one executable and you have to switch between them. To debug your code...just set a breakpoint somewhere rightclick in the source code and Toggle Breakpoint ltctlgtltcltgtltbgt then start the launcher you created with MenugtRungtDebug Launch F. As soon a the breakpoint is hit you gain control in kdevelop again which now shows the debug interface. ,kde,coxpmnk,1,t5_2qh6i

11197646,0,t1_df12ebq,gt QtWebEngine is considered as not GNU compliant.Thats a bullshit allegation based on some license checker script that complains that not every single source code file has a license header that the script considers valid. License headers are not required only proper documentation about the copyright status and license is and that can be achieved in a number of ways. The most ridiculous thing is that the core complains centers around some JavaScript tests that just happen to be developed as part of the Chromoum project but are not even used by Qt WebEngine.,kde,df18myx,6,t5_2qh6i

11526330,0,t1_dg1kqs0,If there was one thing I could change about KDE it would be how dolphin handles browsing up ie. NOT back but up. When you move from a subfolder to its parent folder focus jumps to first folder in parent folder  it should keep focus on the subfolder that you just left.In a folder with many like  or more subfolders dolphins current behavior is absolutely annoying. Im not aware of any other modern well featured file browser that is still doing what dolphin is doing.Ive been complaining about this for years now and even voted on a bug regarding this issue some years back.I really think this is about the last real issue I have with KDE. And thats actually something  to only have one real issue with your OS.,kde,dg2if0c,1,t5_2qh6i

11569205,0,t1_dg6u8y9,I currently dont use a task bar at all but am thinking of trying it or Latte Dock again as spoon as Plasma  reaches my distro.That being said I am a heavy user of Activities and use enough VDs in each that most of the time I dont need to look if a window is hiding beneath another one.So having all windows in the Activity regardless on which VD listed is exactly what I would want. Im happy thats possible but would be just as happy of it wasnt the default if the majority expects it otherwise.I suspect its the default because for complete newbies to VDs that way they arent lost where they put a window. ,kde,dg7dibx,1,t5_2qh6i
