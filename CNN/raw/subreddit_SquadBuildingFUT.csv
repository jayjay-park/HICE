153162,0,t1_cevuib3,The Serie A team is really good which is why I was wondering if I could playtrade my way to a better BPL team... ,SquadBuildingFUT,cevvkgq,1,t5_2zkof
376198,0,t3_1ydw76,Ive spent the past half hour trying to figure this out and they all require drastic changes,SquadBuildingFUT,cfjrb42,1,t5_2zkof
689687,0,t3_2219ye,Ive spent ages trying to figure out the answer to this question... this is the best I can do having everyone naturally at  chem.  If youre patient and get loyalty and get an English BPL manager you can get Leighton Baines at LWB up to  chem then you can use him at LWB and Ashley Young at LW which would be much better than what is currently shown.,SquadBuildingFUT,cgio3ne,1,t5_2zkof
795400,0,t3_235en0,start by going with thissell ashley cole and buy clichy..if you want to play online its a mustkyle walker at RB...I love richards as a sub off the bench who can play any spot in the back...jovetic is absolute monster that price...either walcott or nani on the right...I prefer ashley young on the left but its a preference thing...I think you should start with that should be less than K after you sell ashley cole and the belgian RM Martens?..also get the upgraded version of koscilieny...its about a k difference if you sell the old oneI also think you should build with this as your end goalaside from toure that squad is not THAT expensive for the upgrades you get...use ferdandinho until you can afford himhopefully that is a helpful guide!,SquadBuildingFUT,cguouxn,1,t5_2zkof

2874899,0,t3_2t1ahs,You have a very offensive midfield how about Koschelny Debuchy and MaticFernandinhioany other good defensive mid? Would help balance the team a little more.,SquadBuildingFUT,cnuvkdv,1,t5_2zkof
2895311,0,t3_2t8nkk,Assuming you want to keep your squad mainly silvers you should definitely get Anita instead of cleverly hes a bit faster and much better defensively so will help balance your squad. If you want to keep it mostly bpl and silver I dont see an easy way to work bale in.,SquadBuildingFUT,cnx78jz,1,t5_2zkof

3184639,0,t1_corz6ty,You probably missed him because he was upgraded from silver recently. Ive used his silver version in this squad and he was pretty solid so i hope his gold card is okay too.,SquadBuildingFUT,cos361i,2,t5_2zkof

3710558,0,t1_cqf46k8,I was thinking almost the same thing. I use a lot of these players in a Serie A  Ligue  hybrid but I play  so I have no need for wingers. Griezmann is a great option for this formation.,SquadBuildingFUT,cqf89da,3,t5_2zkof
