I suffered from a lying scale would give a different number every place you moved it on the floor varied by lbs either direction of real weight. After getting our weight at a verified location we tried to get that number out of the scale we tried for like  mins moving it from place to place. It never got closer than lbs off. I used that scale for  months of weight loss and man the grief it caused me. The weight started really slow for me as well and it takes a crazy amount of effort to keep it going. Just because you are following the suggested MFP daily calories doesnt mean youll see a result. Check your weight and if you find it isnt moving reduce it and see if that changes things. Everyone has different bodies and its a general formula.Good luck on the Ck. As a runner the best advice I can give is finish the runs. You dont need to go fast you dont need to run them the whole way do what you can but finish. ,TeamWatermelon,d5rmlfs,2,t5_3f9mv
