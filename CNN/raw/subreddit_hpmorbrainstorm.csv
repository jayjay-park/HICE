3264955,0,t1_cp0et43,Youre assuming he can control the velocity commanded by each broom individually which Ill accept.  dimensional rigid bodies have  degrees of freedom x y and z position as well as  rotations. Youve handled the translations but Im not convinced that method prevents him from rotating. And thats what would throw off his aim with either device.,hpmorbrainstorm,cp0fjxn,1,t5_3784e
3265203,0,t3_2xis8a, Chapter  about the stoneA snake lay on the bed.The Philossopherss Sstone hissed the snake.If thered been a massmanufacturable means of safe immortality this entire time and nobody had bothered Harry was going to snap and kill everyone.I read of it in a book Harry hissed. Concluded it wass obviouss myth. No reason why ssame device would provide immortality and endlesss gold. Not unlesss ssomeone wass jusst inventing happy sstoriess. Not to mention every ssane persson sshould have been ressearching wayss to make more Sstoness or kidnapping maker to produce. Thought of you sspecifically teacher.A hissing of cold laughter. Reassoning iss wisse but not wisse enough. Like with horcrux sspell abssurdity hidess true ssecret. True Sstone iss not what that legend ssayss. True power iss not what sstoriess claim. Sstones ssuppossed maker wass not one who made it. One who holdss it now wass not born to name now ussed. Yet Sstone iss powerful healing device in truth. Have you heard it sspoken of?Jusst in the book.One who holdss Sstone iss repossitory of much lore. Taught sschoolmasster many ssecretss. Sschoolmasster hass ssaid nothing of Sstoness holder nothing of Sstone? No hintss?Not that I can eassily recall Harry replied honestly.Ah hissed the snake. Ah well.Could assk sschoolmasster No! Do not assk him boy. He would not take quesstion well.But if the Sstone only healss Sschoolmasster doess not believe that would not believe that. Too many have ssought Sstone or ssought holders lore. Do not assk. Musst not assk. Do not try to obtain Sstone yoursself. I forbid.,hpmorbrainstorm,cp0gkky,1,t5_3784e
