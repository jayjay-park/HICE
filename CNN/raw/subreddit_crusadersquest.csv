3073214,0,t1_cog49oi,True going down to b of  different dungeons and farming for eons until the RNG gods award you each of them is a whole lot different than just promoting  wizards into archon. I think what really does it for me with archon is just how it keeps stacking on itself.  Wizard wep  highest atk in game Archon gets  phys mag penetration Since archon does not need physmag penetration use x atk upgrades on the weapon for even more damage than any other single character Archon gets  spheres that do  of atk which is absurdly high from weapon upgrades worth of magic damage so this gives dual type coverage plus those spheres last forever and tick like crazy Finally add in energy of goddess and mana recycle and the buffs stay up the meteors never stop the spheres stay forever and you always win MVP on world boss unless youre up against another archon.,crusadersquest,cogjblo,1,t5_351ir

3092569,0,t1_coid8km,if you have three healers then the reason the boss is dealing more damage is because your partner is doing all the work while youre just sitting there pumping out heals when you could be attacking . so shouldnt the guy killing the boss be mvp? the boss has a set amount of hp   for example. if ur the   healer guy and its a ridiculously long fight youre gonna heal way more than   for  allies and thus you get mvp when toast adds up dmg  healsEDIT gonna test out this theory,crusadersquest,coijknj,0,t5_351ir

Hikari doesnt synergize in either of these comps and would just be a Hikari jammed into a dartmaria engine.,crusadersquest,cowy013,1,t5_351ir

You get a  chain with Yeo which then activates nazrunes passive and wrecks the enemy team. Leon is pretty much a tanky placeholder you can replace him with Mew if you get one. You also might actually be able to take on next weeks disarm dungeon which contains a top end legendary hero as a reward if you use this team.In terms of longevity Yeo and mew are useful in pve in the future and Naz is a part of different end game pvp teams.Or as HorribleDat said you can also do YeoLCrowNaz,crusadersquest,cp9oxtm,1,t5_351ir

3348755,0,t1_cp9z3mw,From my experience with running Rachel with tMR for stun lockdown it really isnt worth it to give up EoG because otherwise there are gaps in chain use which is a major vulnerability. I think EoG healer I like Mew due to her constant block generation and a tBD healer or Alex depending on preference make one of the better Rachel team comps. Alex is definitely safer but damage potential is higher with double healer.Will say though with a single Blood Donation Rachel doesnt have to rely on stuns anymore because she ramps into high KO potential. It may actually be more efficicent in PvP to run tBD over EoG if you run a comp where tBD will target with Rachel in range Alex hogs it all to himself.,crusadersquest,cp9zf0e,2,t5_351ir

3508197,0,t3_30g4dd,I dont really understand anything but here are some things I noticed. Nurspys attack debuff got removed. Was she ever OP to warrant getting nerfed or was that to offset the other change? Im guessing the damage from her syringe got buffed. After rereading Nurspys change it looks like its no longer a flat  attack debuff per tick but the enemies lose  of their attack when affected. Its basically Fierce Totem now. Marias passive proc counts as a  chain for other units again? Abel got rebalanced! His counter damage decreases but he gains hpattack buff after! Jang wonmy Raymond Chan  Mondrian? I dont understand this change but it looks like another nerf. a buff. Vain got changed. It looks like hes going to be a counter guy too but not like Thor. He gets stronger each time hes hit so the more damage he takes the stronger he becomes. Im liking this change  He gets a single  attack buff when he gets hit. Better than before since he peaks immediately instead of waiting to get hit multiple times.EDIT looks like mondrians change was a buff added thoughts on vain changes.  EDIT reread nurspy changeEDIT uFloreau makes a good argument I think the BD change means that ALL skills and effects with stacking buffsdebuffs no longer stacks so they changed the skills with those effects. This makes sense given the heroes that were changed. Nurspy used to debuff per tick now its just  for any enemies hit. Same for Sasquatch.   Mondrian used to debuff  per hit now its  for any enemy hit.   Vane used to get a stacking  damage buff every time he got hit after using a block now its a fixed  for the duration.,crusadersquest,cps5r15,2,t5_351ir

Its up to you if you choose to promote leon or not you wont regret either decisions.Personally I think you ought to focus on ArchongtSusanoogtLeon.Archon is one of the best free mages in game. nonpremium hero. I think her description is will say he but rest assured archon is a girl not a boy.Anyways run Archon as leader shell take you further than Leonsusanoo will.Stein is a very peculiar hero. I wouldnt recommend him to beginners though he is usable. I would recommend other healers such as MewYeoWoompa who are more userfriendly.The best skill to unlock is Energy of Goddess unlock with Yeowoodong. This will give your game a huge power spike.Focus on getting a squad of  hero before attempting to expand your roster. PVP is your best source of free gems.Whats the most limiting resource in game? The answer is gold. If youre fp I suggest reading a gold farming guide on how best to farm gold. If you dont wanna look for one in short Dont venture past Desert  Hard for optimal gold farming. Double up on gold quest and grind that gold. Dont fall for the trap known as Popo. Shes one of the biggest conartist around! Only purchase Dungeon Keys if your planning to use them or PVP tickets if your planning to pvpWhy desert H?  You unlock the option to forge legendary weapons when you clear H.  You limit the s of possible gold quest available allowing you to double up on  gold quest for Forest. The goldmeat ratio is fantastic if you can get that going.I would write more but i gtg.

4104672,0,t3_37l60z,Its this time of the week again.We get one of these every week and every week its the same answer.Yes after the FOS patch ladder go separated and several ladder boards emerged. Two atleast.It has nothing to do with what platform you are on IOS or Android and has nothing to do with where you are from either boards are mixed with both Asian European and American users.Here is my board im from EU.Im . ranked th.Means that currently . players in Masters.Do note that daily more and more people get into masters so in the end there will be several thousands at the end of the week.Not all people have  winrate teams to be able to get into masters within the first two days of the new week so expect more and more people to flow into the league towards the end of the week.Usually it takes around  days for the average player to get into masters.So saying that there are only  players in the first  days doesnt mean anything yet have to wait till the last day to really see how many players made it.,crusadersquest,cro5oat,1,t5_351ir
4105096,0,t1_cro50io,Thats fine math and all but if less people are motivated to grind PvC and are settling for lower tiers given the time invested thats a decrease in overall gem payout because less people are making it to masters regardless of preserved percents. Unless you have data points comparing the thousands of players in masters before and after splits saying that there are thousands of players now is a moot point also evidence in this thread shows that the currently split boards only have little over a thousand in masters now and will likely only reach pluralk by the end of the week which I dont think is unfair to say is a low value consider that its already Thursday.Also if server load was the sole issue wed see evenly split boards which doesnt seem like the case given the easyhard mode boards of the first split and the current split of questionable origins or wed see leaderboards split based on location which certainly isnt the case.They have the data for how many people play and the effect leaderboards have on people grinding PvC and have decided that splitting leaderboards leads to a favorable outcome for them. I doubt that its simply due to lowering traffic stress. Could it be? Sure but it could also be otherwise.Nobody can say for sure to confirm that lowering traffic stress is the only reason theyre continuing to split up leaderboards even if Toast were to release a public notice because itd simply be good PR to deny anything else.,crusadersquest,cro7esa,1,t5_351ir

4151034,0,t1_crtcrmc,I think thats the general mindset of people once they get a stable collo team.

Lucky for me I got all three with ideal slots maybe not Korin but Ill live with AA and just kept using that combo since it was flexible enough to handle almost every collo team.  I just like duels more if there was an easierfaster way to get into them makes you think more about the weaknesses of your comp and what you can do to cover it up.  Close battles too so many times where Thor is the last one standing in the corner vs some mage and he manages to squeeze out enough to dps them before they can come up with enough to kill him lol.

I really dont notice it in B but maybe Im missing out on something.Roland has his stuns heals and SoI which can be annoying but the real damage comes from Rochefort and his counters he also does Wind Slash. I would advise against bringing highhitmelee heroes as that will activate both Rolands and Rochs passives. Your V probably ate all of those counters.I had a lot of success using Prestina and Viper but I think any hunter that can push can do a good enough job. You just need to generate enough bars to keep Prestina up and that will pretty much stop the two from doing anything while you keep them pushed away from your team with your hunter  pally. Rochs counter with the flying birds is AoE and will hit your whole team so you might want to bring Alex since he can also push.,crusadersquest,cu6s6vr,1,t5_351ir

Crap SBW with crap converts.Lol when you craft a SBW you have to accept that risk and if you dont like how it looks then dont bother crafting. Simple as that lol. I just craft SBW and if I get complete shit just salvage it and wait another three days. Simple as that. Besides its not like SBWs are gamechanging. Sure it allows weaker heroes to shine but the current trend is that heroes that are in the meta for clearing pve and destroying pvc have soso or absolute crap SBWs. But having an SBW is a luxury rather than a necessity. ArchonMewAlex can clear all of tundra give them SBWs and their jobs are made easier faster clear times.

5030920,0,t3_3juima,Ive always like Mandy when they updated her and before the release of Roland. Shes great because her damage scales higher than Sneak and she does crazy damage in PvE. Because of her wellrounded abilities and she can do high damage with  or  chains or in the middle with a stun with  chains. Mostly its because of her AoE  chain spam due to passive shooting twice and followed up with Neutral damage  chains if you have tWG. You can use her as a lead or support she works either way. The best use for her is with block generation to keep her passive spamming. Viper formally known as Sneak was my first premium and nd six star. Hes great in terms of just being able to block spam and deal lots of damage but that cuts his based HP to be low and hindered by lots of monsters in PvE because of their high armor. His damage is not consistent unless you have block generation from Yeowoodong. So thats why his great for PvC because his quick short burst damage along with huge tOD damage usually wins coll matches in seconds. One Viper use to take you to  or  Masters tier but now since Roland is around he just cancels Sneaks animation and that basically cuts his advantage to kill enemies swiftly without taking damage back and Roland just heals whatever Sneak throws at him. So if you want to you could just avoid Roland teams. Mandy beats Roland because even after he is stunned he cannot heal during his stun animation which is why her  chain poison keeps hitting him during the animation. In terms of Rolands around Mandy is better. At the start of the match you could also just  chain mandy to stun the enemies immediately to give you time to kill Roland before he starts his stun animation. I dont have No. yet so I dont know how Mandy is with tSmoke but I assume its super strong and could probably increase your chances of survival. I pair Mandy up with Roland vs Viper with Alex. Right now Im using Demeter  lead lv MR  star weap RPcrit. HA Mandy   RPCD.CD code and Roland  DRHP.CC Ice Hammer lv  AoP in PvP and they cheese other Roland comps because Demeter and Mandys spell effects still work while being stunned and the enemy team dies in a couple of seconds with Anut as my savior during stun animation or being attacked. I want to make them my main team and Ive lost no tickets so far but only lose real PVP. Demeter is super strong with Mandy because her  chains crits a lot with  based crit and lowers enemy resistance by  since Demeter needs someone to crit  times in  seconds to deal real damage. Usually teams that kill me die with this team. Also its one of my Tundra H teams. I cant think of anything else to say but I love Mandy.  ,crusadersquest,cusf1dy,1,t5_351ir

From someone whos already completed the gamestory mode has all the heroes they want and just plays Colosseum or from a player who still needs to complete these things? This event may be boring in your opinion but it may be very useful to others and further engage them into the game. Not only that but it may also allow more people to actually participate in the Colloseum. They certainly were not obligated to do anything for the m milestone.

5079553,0,t1_cuy9hdq,I agree and this is obvious. But SBW and everything in games like this and all games... its all about the game dangling a carrot on a stick. There needs to be a some goal to move toward... end game players have few goals to achieve I have   characters all  MAX... at some point you need to be able to get the carrot.  Then the game should add new carrots out of your reach to keep you keep playing.  Standard stuff.  We need vertical progress making characters stronger not just variety of gameplay with new charactersThe problem right now it is that the usable SBW carrots are too few and far between because of unbalanced RNG.  The level of RNG isnt balanced with the reward gained.  Far too much effort for very random minimal upgrades.  I dont think the game can sustain a communities attention or money based on this.  SBW should still be RNG and they should still take a lot of timeresources to get but in the past  months I have  SBW that are usable after rolling .  If the carrots arent attainable people will stop playing... and Ive seen this in my friends list with most of my long time friends currently inactive.  SBW need to be difficult but not RNGimpossible to give something to work towards while not demoralizing players. My suggestions are just that suggestions.  Long story short the system isnt perfect so how canshould it be improved? or are you suggesting that everything is fine and that no changes are needed?,crusadersquest,cuya14s,1,t5_351ir

I was quite gratified to see many Rolands bite the dust and I usually have trouble before that.Have Sneak Hanzo w SBW as side options and looking into Wooparoompa w SBW as a side option.Notable MatchupsCano Struggling somewhat against Double Mew SBW and Mew Roland comps  Dart doesnt have the burst to kill off Cano before her Laser Beams get ridiculous. I think that might change if I can bring Dart up to  or MAX. Usually setting Sneak as leader with leader block bonus if necessary should do well against Double Mew Comps. I have no answer to the Roland splashes as of yet.Thorinmew Requires a nd DPS like Hanzo or Sneak to reliably kill off Thor before Thor becomes ridiculous.  LilithHealerAlexJoan Lilith tMS shreds Dart to nothing in seconds and Roland does diddly squat about that. Sub out Roland for Hanzo to dispel damage transfer and kill off Lilith.ArchonMewTank Timing Anut is key here imho  Watch for the Mana Recycle skill to proc before activating Anut. Hanzo splash Trying to figure out how to reliably deal with him. So far bursting him before he bursts me works well enough so I side in Hanzo here.

And honestly while the extra HA may prove more efficient in the long run it sometimes felt like it wasnt quick enough in certain scenarios where there was just a lot of damage incoming.

5319669,0,t1_cvrdcw0,I was hit and miss against Soltar with my AlexMewArchon team and theyre all max with  star SBWs.  Ive switched to MewYeoLMonte with SBWs and have only lost once since then.,crusadersquest,cvrnene,1,t5_351ir
5324020,0,t1_cvs3oen,I currently run AlexSusViperL with no SBWs and in PVC my results are a little mixed.Generally if you have a Sus attack to cut their armor and then one or two Viper blocks you can end a round even against a full  star sustain team in a few seconds.However mess up that rush or allow the enemy tankhealer to get going and frequently you will hit a wall and the match will either be bloody and ugly or you just wont have the DPS to win and they will lame you out. lotusrunner is well on point with their commentary on Viper team drawbacks and I echo them fully. That said I find it a fun team to play as you need to try and time your bursts and your goddess can make all the difference. For example Dionne is useful but she makes Viper miss all his shots... however her launch usually coincides perfectly with the amount of time it takes him to pull out and shoot Overdrive so time it well and enemies will fall onto the missiles and you will recover in time to continue your block spam.I am currently working on a Thorinmew team just because though.

Its literally a random amount of damage from a range of  HA per tick to  HA per tick. In my testing I saw as low as . HA per tick and got as high as . from which I think its safe to say the ingame number range given is accurate.I honestly dont know how Hodgekin got his number in his post.

5355452,0,t3_3nujva,Hey guys got a few questions. . Is there a compiled list of comprehensive SBW effects like IcyFenixs list for hero passives? Im mainly interested in the effects not mentioned in the ingame description such as Darts immunity to stuns during his passive and Drakes tidal wave.. Did Toast change how WG worked in one of the recent patches? It seems that  or  chains used before the actual animation of WG are no longer procd as  chains. This is especially obvious when youre block spamming with Maxi. Is this a bug or is this intended?. Is there a bug with Lilith and shadow mage? If you were to use a chain with Liliths passive activated so its actually a chain the shadow mages will only cast a chain. This goes against what the shadow mage skill says it should be doing.Thanks!,crusadersquest,cvw7wyx,1,t5_351ir

5839614,0,t1_cxl04fm,Of course the game will never be truly balanced but people dont understand there should be a limit to the variance in power between heroes and skills. The heroes and skills I listed are extreme outliers in the current state of the game.  Many of these heroes and skills are in fact not replaceable because of their absurd scalability andor uniqueness.  Toast did a fantastic job with balance changes in the last patch and a few more patches like that will greatly improve the game overall.  Power is always cyclical in complex classskill games like this but the level of variance in power is what the developers need to keep control of.  ,crusadersquest,cxl3mdk,1,t5_351ir

Yet youre expecting anything ever put into a choice to have everlasting results.I never once said dont upgrade a character simply because of their strength im simply saying that you know going in how things are broken and to then have reasonable expectations that the resources youre investing into that currently broken mechanic may not always be worth what you expected. ,crusadersquest,cywk4x7,1,t5_351ir

6306211,0,t1_cz6famy,Still  at the moment. Cant really comment on damage output but heres what I can say about her passive Her  and  chain have almost no difference so you can run her as a chain spammer and not as lead. Edit chain actually travels farther. chain is like half the screen  chain is a little more than a screen it seems. But mostly irrelevant as long as you mark at least one enemy Edit doesnt seem like you even need to mark an enemy as long as her shield activates after she uses a block. Her chains are slow but piercing so they will hit every enemy on the screen and then some. However marking multiple enemies does not proc her passive more often. If you mark one enemy and use a chain Vesper only gets  water droplets. So to get her passive to proc you need to use  blocks in total x chain x chain chain  chain etc. Her autoattack passive when she gets  water droplets triggers immediately and launches  bursts of water in a straight line that hit the first enemy they touch. If it kills the enemy any of the remaining water streams may hit the next enemy. They are not piercing. Overall she seems a bit block dependent since she needs  blocks to trigger her passive. Would probably need to be paired with a team that can generate a lot of blocks if you wanted to max out her damage potential but otherwise she works decently as a secondary DPS. Her  passive is a bit confusing since it says it increases her resist penetration by  but no one has natural resistance penetration so Im not sure if it doubles resistance penetration if she haves it or if it meant it adds damage equal to  of her resistance.,crusadersquest,cz6g18h,2,t5_351ir

There is nothing in the game that you cant get by grinding out some colo dungeons or story modes. It might take a bit longer but its not like the road to getting resources is horrible I love playing through everything. If you want to speed up the process and keep the game running so they keep coming out with new heroes new ways to power your current heroes and add more story then spend a bit of your hard earned money to keep the game moving forward and everyone employed.

6312949,0,t3_422rl6,Okay a few things have changed mostly with his Home Wrecker.First off he changed from a support class to a leader class. Second his SP drain now only applies on his passive attack which activates upon teammates chasing him and went down from  to  per hit. SP is now given out to all heroes not just the leader from what Ive seen testing itUsing a chain puts him into combat mode offensive buff. Ally blocks used during combat mode makes him drop a set of bomb support as if using a chain skill but with increased attack power.If you use his block then activate a teammates block right after it fires off both his block and his passive at once.ampnbspHome Wrecker changesThe toxic cloud dealing ongoing HPSP damage is now gone and the damage type was changed from magic to phys. On the flip side it deals a lot more damage immediately as it hits.It now gives a shield. So hes like Korin except much more mediocre on the defense part.

6428664,0,t1_czk7nb8,I agree that the time and resources spent on his SBW and maxing him out could probably be better spent elsewhere depending on who you have.  But as to your other point in some ways he seems specifically designed to avoid the pitfalls associated with most paladin primary damage dealers such as Kriemhild?  Because his chain damage comes from his HP not Attack Power it seems to mitigate at least on paper the tradeoff between tankiness and damage.  But with the availability of damage redirects Alex Necron etc. I think you are probably right that ultimately other chain damage dealers will be more useful even if they are glass cannons.Also I agree that it doesnt seem to make a lot of sense for Toast to continue pushing our more heroes that dont have anything special to offer.  I guess you could view JinKyung as special by being a paladin with HPbased damage but I wish his SBW would offer some additional utility instead of just increased damage.,crusadersquest,czk9fnj,2,t5_351ir

7414859,0,t3_4gv1hp,But okay. Lets compare Old Leon with New Leon assuming the tooltip is working as it states.gt No SBWOld Leon deals  of AtkPow with Armor Penetration equal to  of own Armor. . Armor is . Armor Penetration and  of . AtkPow is . Physical Damage. Old Leon deals a total of . Physical Damage with . Armor Penetration.New Leon deals  of AtkPow with an additional  of Maximum HP with Armor Penetration equal to  of own Armor. As far as I can tell it takes  of his Natural HP that means only his Level  Training HP is used to calculate the damage also it seem that the  Bonus HP he gets from his SBW does not count so I imagine Berries Weapons etc do not count either. So  of . is . Physical Damage. New Leon deals a total of . Physical Damage except only . of it has Armor Penetration.Since it seems likes the  HP Damage only uses his Natural HP Leon will always only ever do extra . Physical Damage at most. Meaning a DD either for Armor for Armor Penetration or HP for Physical Damage is completely worthless for ironically offensivepurposes.If Leon worked exactly how the tooltip says then he would incredibly suck more.Edit About Leons Passive only using his Natural HP. Its possible that the  also counts Berries Weapons etc if theyre Permanent Maximum HP as oppose to Leons SBW Passive which gives him Temporary Maximum HP. An easy way to test this is equipping him with a Weapon that has HP Upgrades and seeing if the extra damage is doing more or not.,crusadersquest,d2l0rxe,2,t5_351ir

7570699,0,t3_4ivbxt,Hey guys. I made  post here previously regarding economical ticket farming and team comps for coliseum. Well Im close to reaching my target this week as I have already broken through the top  percentile. Now I need some serious advice for how to manage my team goddess combo for getting past . I Know  is probably out of the question with my current team but I wanna at least break the next threshold with  days left it seems more than plausible. Ill just outline my team and what strategy Ive been using. So far I mow down basically every single team comp besides May and Arita. I want to know how to deal with Arita for the most part as I can more than occasionally burst down may with Roche if im quick about it.My team is as followsBenji   with AAA   x rpen  and  . HAMamba   with AAF x rpen x and LS Beatrice   with ADF HA . Arm F LSRoche  . AD SBW with Apen   and arm I also have Rachel no sbw and Leon sbw Im constantly switching out ben and mamba when I feel like one or the other could be more successful. Benj does more damage overall but mamba hits the entire team guaranteed on most burst encounters. One of the issues im having is consistency. I want Beatrices passive to trig on the whole team ideally every time. However making her the leader just seems risky bc of block priority interfering with good burst damage so the synergy is hard to maintain there. the only other healers I have are aria yeo and stein. none of which have SBW so its hard to see the advantage over having afd boosted by the buff.Most games I use Chronos to slow the other team down giving me time to set up Beatrices  chain and follow up with Roche and mambaben. However as I approach  this seems to become a very precarious method as a lot of the time Im facing Arita now who just decimates my team. there must be some way I can optimise to take her down because I have actually done it a few times but not sure what I did for the success. Who should the leader be? Which goddess should I be using with this team?Any expert advice would be appreciated. I know I probably need Himiko and some other prem contract heroes. But this is what I have right now and I feel like pulling  con is an utter waste. Usually its a crapshoot and as I dont pw I end up blowing  gems for the entire week on dupes and trash which could have gone towards farming Wb and FoS for more SBW forging. Finally It seems like once you get past  you start getting pushed out by  almost every hour or less? Should I just be stacking tickets until Sunday? Or should I try to keep this momentum going with a ticket by ticket basis? Thank you.,crusadersquest,d32r2fn,1,t5_351ir

Maybe improve the root?  I think mamba only fell out of favor because of may. I would really love to see Benjamin mamba or aria given a res pen buff for allies. We have multiple heroes that give apen but not really any good respen buffs.  They did add res pen to Dorothy and Maria but neither give even close to as much as hanzo and Arita or even lee. Spiny is pretty cute so I could be happy with a nice damage buff for her.  If dox and lupeow get sbw instead of spiny and Benjamin I hope doxs weapon doesnt make him too much stronger.  He is already very strong. I dont have or know anything about lupe so I dont know what to say about her. ,crusadersquest,d3pxdfo,2,t5_351ir

8318525,0,t3_4tdslf,I think the best way to make this appealing to both the players and Hangame since they want money and too much favorable RNG towards the players is probably something they dont want is to do a cycle of rateups of  heroes randomly chosen for a rateup! NOT  from each class but ONLY  RANDOM HEROES! Also these  random chosen heroes can be ANY HERO that is  stars and above so promotables as well.BUTTTTTT the  random heroes chosen for each class will be DIFFERENT FROM EVERY PLAYER. So whenever you log in after the Sunday Reset a slot machine will roll showing the  heroes chosen for your specific rateup. But what about Hangame? How will they profit? Simple ITS A SLOT MACHINE! So if you dont get the rateup heroes you want then spend gems my recommendation is  gems to reroll again.But how much of a rateup will these heroes get? My suggestion is a  chance to GET ONE of those  heroes from every contract that turns out to be a white horse. Finally because its a random roll each week this also means next week there is a possibility that one or multiple heroes may be chosen for a rateup again. Only  random heroes chosen each week is definitely a lot less than your proposed  but this is hangame were talking about so my plan coincides with their whole corporate view of making money but we also benefit from it. ,crusadersquest,d5hde62,0,t5_351ir

Now that I reached the endgame I feel burnt out more quickly too because all I can do is grind for resources while I wait to get some new and good SBW or a hero which isnt a dupe and for better results in FoS and PvC you basically needs some particular heroes gated behind tons of RNG. And all the champions stuff isnt really helping because of all its limitations cant send  heroes have to send specific  needs a specific  to unlock and I wont sacrifice my nearly maxed Rachel while leveling a dupe still cost time and resources.

You wouldnt use Dox without a strong multihit partner but with one hes one of the best burst units in the game. SBW Victoria is the same.Dragon Sword is easier to get and has good damage and defense overall.

BP doesnt expire so k BP could be saved for when a new batch of heroes get released and one of them happens to join the ranks of meta heroes. Gaining BP through FP means would mean waiting over  months to let it accumulate. Getting  gems for two skins only takes maybe  weeks depending on how well you performed in PvC.  months vs  month is a nobrainer for me. Im not going to fully advocate k BP is the only option for players as Ive already locked in the SBW selection coupon after getting my old hammer and iron cache annihilated by Ferguss inept ability to forge me an Athena SBW but I just cant understand how you could truly justify  gems worth of skins which could easily be obtained with maybe a months worth of casual PvCing.,crusadersquest,dazwyrf,2,t5_351ir

10890866,0,t3_5vmuoe,Im pretty sure this is a little faulty.A weapon upgrade does not cost that much from the first try this would assume you already upgraded the weapon  times meaning you have to count the first  rolls before you can proceed with the maximum gold cost and Im almost certain  of the people refrain from upgrading at the full cost instead will just resort to a gem reroll to reset the price to preserve gold. This only assumes if you magically upgraded the weapon  times already and then refused to spend a gem so you can continue upgrading at the maximum cost. Upgrading at  is only true if you have plentiful gold aka over  million if not more otherwise it is much easier t upgrade at  since people commonly reset the prices to preserve gold as not everyone is capable of farming tremendous amounts of gold. This sharply tilts the favor into upgrading at   because as shown in the chart it would take someone  tries to reach the maximum gold cost meaning theyd only start paying  AFTER upgrading  times and it was estimated that you have only  of getting a consecutive failure you can assume that they stop upgrading there meaning their costs is substantially less than someone upgrading at  which is shown takes approximately  tries to get the same percentage meaning they pay  extra maximum values or they reset the cost which costs two gems.At any rate the consecutive failures only should show that if you already upgraded the sbw  times which would offset all the numbers and when you start to consider when people start gemming to reset costs  still reigns victorious.Also chance failure does that refer to great chance? Since this would assume you get a Great! upgrade every single upgrade.,crusadersquest,de3bdav,3,t5_351ir

11334900,0,t1_dfgleu3,Also his buffs can be quite potent depending on how you build his Soulbound Weapon. For example with an AA Soulbound Weapon with Hero Attack Power . in both slots he could buff ally Attack Power by about . You also have to consider that these buffs are in addition to all the other things he provides superb healing and SP generation and enemy attack power reduction.Its movement speed. Allies will run faster. Not that useful as far as I can tell but fun to observe.,crusadersquest,dfgshp5,1,t5_351ir
