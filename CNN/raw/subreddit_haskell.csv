359464,0,t1_cfhq0bq,The example specifically points to implementing laziness by forcing evaluation only when a useless function invocation is done equivalent to turning a value of type t into a value of type  gt t. This relies on the fact that introducing a lambda actually changes the semantics of the program.The haskell IRC channel told me that one important difference is that x gt f x is partially defined even if f itself is fully undefined. This is probably the most obvious one it illustrates that etaexpansion actually makes a function more defined than it is when it isnt expanded IE x gt f x . g may work when f . g will crash. Also although I dont remember the specifics the GHC optimizer also treats etaexpanded values differently from ones that arent so at times the seemingly useless act of removing explicit parameters or writing them down explicitly can make a difference in performance.,haskell,cfi0w9y,1,t5_2qh36

Just generate the huge list and Ill take what I need thank you.A good example is a compiler. A compiler effectively takes a bytestream converts it into a lexeme stream and then converts the lexeme stream into a parse tree. Then you do semantic analysis on the parse tree and generate code.You could create a lexical analyser that dumps the entire bytestream into a list and then pass that list into the parser. You could create one that is like a lexeme dispenser. It has a pump that generates tokens from the bytestream as you ask for them so you can do the compile in one pass.

881899,0,t3_247g16,Haskell is quite good at facing the issue of lack of anticipation of particular values because its precise type system allows you to make illegal states unrepresentable This allows you to write functions which do anticipate every possible input because there are fewer possibilities to anticipate and because those possibilities are defined in a way which makes it easy to list them all.That being said Haskells precise types do not look like a value of this type except it also satisfies this predicate like the examples you gave. If this is what you want a more appropriate choice might be a dependentlytyped language such as Idris or Agda. Those languages do allow you to write predicates and then they require callers to prove that the values they pass satisfy the predicates. Both of those languages are based on Haskell and as such it would be wise to learn Haskell first.Haskells precise types are of a different flavor instead of arbitrary predicates you create rules which describe how valid values are formed and the only valid values are those which can be formed in this way. The advantage of this approach over the predicates approach is that callers dont have to prove that their values are valid arguments since anything they can construct using the rules is going to be a valid input.For example lets build a type representing lists of booleans containing at most  False values.    data AtMostFalse  Nil | True AtMostFalse | False AtMostFalse    data AtMostFalse  Nil | True AtMostFalse | False AtMostFalse    data AtMostFalse  Nil | True AtMostFalse | FalseValid values of type AtMostFalse include    Nil    True Nil    True True True True True Nil    False False False    False True True True False True True True Falsebut not    False False False False NilOf course this representation is not really a list of Booleans. Its easy however to convert them to an ordinary list of booleans    toList  AtMostFalse gt Bool    toList Nil      toList True xs  True  toList xs    toList False xs  False  toList xs        toList  AtMostFalse gt Bool    toList Nil      toList True xs  True  toList xs    toList False xs  False  toList xs        toList  AtMostFalse gt Bool    toList Nil      toList True xs  True  toList xs    toList False  FalseAnd thats the essense of Haskells precise types instead of a type plus a predicate we define a new type which is isomorphic to the set of values which satisfy the predicate and then we implement conversion functions if necessary. Of course not all predicates can be converted in this fashion a list of at most  False values would be quite annoying for example. But there are surprisingly many commonlyencountered predicates which can. I thought that the predicates you have listed were good examples of predicates which are too complicated for Haskell but as the other comments prove with enough clever tricks it might be possible after all!,haskell,ch4iwzn,11,t5_2qh36

916599,0,t1_ch8bp7j,gt how to be uber flexible without having two packages of the same softwareYou say Gentoo is better but...gt if A needs B ..x and C needs B ..x then you get both installed no need for manually making b. and b. packages like some distros do.Cabal can already do that this isnt unusual. In fact everything can. I didnt explain myself well enough.The trick is what if A and C depend on the same version of B but in different ways? What if they both depend exactly on B . but they require it to be built different ways? What if A needs B built with an extra feature but C does not care and I already have B installed? What happens if I overwrite B to satisfy A? Just the exact same version of B with this extra feature? Does C break? The question is it depends but in reality just about every package manager on earth has this problem  including Node. The problem is the destructive upgrade of existing dependencies or in other words that your package manager isnt purely functional. So the real core of the question is given A and C depend on the same version of B  what happens if B changes and what does that imply for A and C?No package manager other than Nix has a graceful way of dealing with this AFAIK because this change in the dependency is captured precisely by Nixs cryptographic hash. This is the ultimate sort of identifier of the exact dependencies including that extra feature  relying on anything else other than an exact specification of the dependencies leads to pain. In Nix If I installed B. it would have an hash identifying it. Now lets say I reinstall B. with an extra feature on zlib or something  now the dependency hash has changed because the inputs to B itself have changed! Thus this difference manifests at the package level as a hash discrepancy and the two packages are not the same even though they have the same name same version.This isnt a hypothetical situation and in practice occurs all the time for us. The real way this manifests is the deadly cannot reinstall without breaking errors. What happens here is that dependant packages essentially force a recompilation of upstream packages in a way that changes the ABI. But doing that breaks upstream packages again because their ABIs have change too as a result.Why does this occur? The reason this is so much more difficult for us is because we actually have an ABI we compile against with cross module optimisation  the last bit is what makes the difference. Interpreted languages dont care about things down the dependency chain possibly forcing upwards recompilation like we do. Furthermore most languages do not care about cross module optimisation. C has a stable ABI so an upgrade of a package inplace can be considered possible in a lot of instances. NodeRubyPerl obviously it doesnt matter. For GHC it makes a very big difference  recompiling B may force recompilation of A and C simply because their dependent interface files may change.gt But theres nothing preventing the OS to call rubygem or cabal etc itself and do this automatically for every rubygem package  no need for having a separate package maintainer for Debian one for Red Hat etc. It should just work  there shouldnt be a need for a third party maintainer to babysit a package that was already created and shipped either through hackage or the rubygem site etc.The problem is every language  and every Linux distro  has vastly different policies on how to manage dependencies and what exactly packages like this mean to them. On top of that every language has a different kind of dependency resolution that must be dealt with specifically. Semver vs what Hackage does already for example are two different approaches. And Haskell has a lot of complex machinery to detect when we do need to recompile things  and it works! So wed have to invent all this anyway the question is how any Distro maintainer chooses to leverage that.,haskell,ch8h1vc,1,t5_2qh36
929454,0,t1_ch9x56o,gt Why does it matter to the human what the underlying representation is? This doesnt affect the API at all.It does because the underlying type representation needs to be sematically correct. If it isnt then while you can work hard to try to make the API semantically correct the type system is no longer helping you. You are almost certainly going to get things wrong for something as complex as time.The DateTime type in hourglass looks equivalent to UTCTime in time so thats fine. And Im not sure how its an improvement. But Date is semantically wrong so I hope at least the constructor is hidden to ensure that only valid values are constructed.A semantically correct type representation of Gregorian time would be unnecessarily complex. I think the choice of UTCTime as the basic type and then providing toGregorian and fromGregorian functions with the obvious type signatures was a great design choice by Ashley. Im not sure why Vincent finds that difficult to use.gtgt Every time I need to use the time API i need to look at the documentation.Two comments First I am sure I would need to consult the documentation for hourglass as much as for time because time is complex. Second that said the documentation for the time library definitely could use improvement. Though its quite usable once you realize that the lists of type class instances are the most important part of the documentation.gtgt C time format string for parsing and printing.gt Yes lets have typesafe parsing and formatting please.Agreed. Cstyle time formatting is pretty standard and used by most programming languages but that doesnt mean I have to like it.gtgt Need to add the oldlocale package when doing formatting.Agreed that this is a very annoying dependency.gt Why is this old if its still in use and doesnt have a replacement?Because no one has written a replacement yet. Because the topic of locales is huge and difficult with a very low ratio of benefit to work. The hourglass library appears to be stuck in the en.us locale.I would love to see Data.Time.Format split out of time into a different package to get rid of the oldlocale dependency. And to be able to use hourglass formatting easily with values from the time library. Perhaps we can get just the amount of locale semantics needed just for formatting time for the most popular locales to start with.,haskell,ch9xm2g,6,t5_2qh36

While waiting for haskellnoob what a misleading username... to reply I tried to imagine how Monad m gt m  could possibly have fewer moving parts than IO  and I found that its not even clear which moving parts are meant IO  computations are made of a large number of primitives while Monad m gt m  only has return and bind. A value of type Monad m gt m  represents many possible values one for each concrete monad M we choose to substitute for m while a value of type IO  represents only one computation. That one computation could behave in many different ways at runtime whereas the value of type Monad m gt m  is pretty much guaranteed to just return  without doing anything else. The type IO  consists of a concrete type constructor the unit type and a type application. The type Monad m gt m  consists of a concrete typeclass a type level variable binding a typelevel constraint the unit type and a type application.So I guess IO  is simpler than Monad m gt m  in some ways while more complicated in others.,haskell,ci82teb,2,t5_2qh36

By this logic can we assume that the declarative languages functional logic are higher level than the imperative procedural OO languages because they instruct the computer what to do instead of how to do something?  Furthermore are the logic paradigm languages Prolog and domain specific languages SQL even higher level than functional Lisp Haskell because we query the computer in human language instead of defining mathematical functions? But then dont we still lose some functionality even with a Turing complete logic language in which case we lose programming power even as we gain a higher level of abstraction closer to our thought process?

1559736,0,t1_cjbrlqi,Language pragmas serve as a middle point between your two extremes.  They allow the continued change of the language but at the same time allow for the community to distinguish the core language from the extensions.  I am gathering that you dont see much of it but there is resistance to much reliance on unnecessary language extensions among much of the Haskell community and extensions leave the problem space open for new solutions.For example had Haskell not used language extensions functional dependencies would have been added to the language a long time ago.  After all functional dependencies were a critical part of real world Haskell for a long time with no alternatives in sight.  But once they were added and considered part of the main language it would have been unthinkable for type families to be proposed and widely implemented in libraries.  Type families now solve many of the same problems in a manner much more consistent with the rest of the language and its no longer clear whether one the other or both of type families or functional dependencies will be widely used in Haskell in five years time.  It would have been a mistake to jump into enshrining functional dependencies into the Haskell Report back in .  See the big hoopla about removing something as trivial as nk patterns and do you really think fundeps would ever be gone even if the community decided they were a bad idea?I think the comment that described language pragmas as a kind of extended beta for new language features got it right.  As a beta rather than an alpha the new features do have nontrivial users who will be impacted if they suddenly go away.  But at the same time they are kept apart from the core language because were not sure its the right thing to do.I dont disagree that with more active management we could reduce the number of language extensions by incorporating the obvious ones like FlexibleContexts ScopedTypeVariables BangPatterns and OverloadedStrings into the language.  But I wouldnt want to do away with the culture of trying things out in nontrivial ways sometimes over  years or so before making a big commitment.,haskell,cjbsb7l,2,t5_2qh36

1838009,0,t3_2flour,What I dont like about all those Haskell type system extensions is that while they move towards to a dependently typed language even the simplest dependently typed program requires us to use a dozen of extensions and weird syntax. Also interaction between all those extensions are not clear. Do I have an unsound system if I use those two in combination? No ideas. And its not just two extensions we need just to be able to have some subset of dependent types its sometimes  extensions.Ive been writing Coq for several months. Although Im not an expert in any sense I wrote a lot of certifiedI think sometimes called verified programs which completely rely on dependent types. While in Haskell Im confused by dozens of extensions inconsistent syntax unknown interactions even the most complex types are so easy to express in Coq I think that this effort in Haskell is just not worth it.I also dont understand all those discussions about erasure. As far as I can see from Coq its at least to some extent a solved problem. See Prop vs Type universes. None of my certified programs in Coq extracted to OCaml or Haskell with runtime redundancy.Just my two cents.,haskell,ckaod0r,11,t5_2qh36

2039574,0,t1_ckz05q1,That is what Im doing essentially. The problem is that new users will have to go through the same thing I did essentially trip over the fact that lots of functions in the prelude are inconsistently not general try to work around it for a while eventually get fed up and look for a new prelude find one realize after a while that their code cant interoperate with other libraries because the new prelude decided to redefine monad look for another prelude ad infinitum.My eventual solution was to make my own essentially baseprelude with the unsafe functions removed experience some issues with cabal sandboxes being able to see it eventually fix those issues ... I still dont know if Im setting myself up with bad habits because as much as I understand all about monads and comonads and arrows and endofunctors my experience with the Haskell ecosystem itself has left me very underconfident.I basically feel like if its not in a type or stated as a law I cant rely on the language for anything. And since plenty of useful behaviour isnt stated as part of the types hell most useful behaviour or programming just be unification its an unpleasant feeling. I dont think new users should be expected to deal with that but as soon as I started to write any actual code I started to experience the problem.Is my prelude any good or am I going to find a bunch of issues later on? I have no idea but for some reason Im expected to design the defaults of a language Im still learning. Punting the issue to another library like classyprelude or baseprelude or basicprelude... doesnt really help either because Im still a new user being expected to choose which library is best when I dont have the background to make that choice. The problem isnt that you have to workaround defaults its that you feel the need to go looking for new defaults at all.Then youve also got the issue of library dependencies. If I were to release anything Id have to change stuff to use the default prelude anyway since for better or worse people dont like having alternative preludes as a dependency. We need sensible module in base. It doesnt have to be called Prelude but it should definitely exist.So I think defaults are very important the standard libraries have a privileged position and if enough people have felt theyre lacking to go out and redesign it then maybe thats evidence it should give up that position or at least share since backwards compatibility is a legitimate concern. I might be able to design my own little prelude but that doesnt mean I can design a good one and it doesnt mean I can put it in base.If I cant rely on the prelude as being a reasonable minimal set of what I should know for Haskell then I can never rely on myself being sure I understand enough to consider myself more than a beginner. I recently came across readMaybe after spending a bunch of time using try.readIO and being tempted to use unsafePerformIO.try.readIO. Tomorrow Im sure Ill learn something else Ive been relying on was similarly terrible. The standard should encourage people to follow good practices but it doesnt. Maybe if I learn everything in base Ill be able to confidently say I understand how to write reasonable good Haskell code.Im still sticking with Haskell despite what I feel are warts but my current policy is to explicitly not recommend new people learn the language unless they have a particular need for STM or some other thing that Haskell does exceptionally well or theyve got someone to hold their hand and walk them through the ecosystem. Coming from python I feel like Ive traded a language which encourages good practices with the standard libraries but bad practices with dynamicmutable everything for a language that has the opposite problem. And seeing as standard libraries can be changed I think they should as long as they are indeed part of the standard.Anyway that my c. I dont think I have much more worthwhile to add so Im bowing out of the discussion.,haskell,ckz2pwa,5,t5_2qh36

2072986,0,t1_cl38lqx,In Idris there are both Monad and VerifiedMonad instances and similarly for many other typeclasses with laws.Theres been lots of discussion over what the best default is for programmers. Edwin seems to be of the opinion that its too much to ask of programmers up front.My opinion is that we probably need more clever support for compiling partial programs. Right now Idris supports holes. You can write part of your program and typecheck it. You can even use the REPL to interactively fill in those holes. But if you try to compile a program with a hole the compiler will simply reject it. It would be nice to see an option to compile programs with holes. The runtime should report an error or do something sensible if they were to be evaluated.Edwin has been clear that the Idris standard library is just a placeholder for the time being.

Haskell is pure right? Try make all your functions pure too.What you should try to do is make all your functions that do the actual logic of the Nim game pure. Read the string and convert it to an int in either the main function or a smaller purpose build function with type IO Int. Then pass this into to your pure Nim logic functions that arent of type IO anything.Start by redefining your Nim functions as having type Int gt Bool or whatever pure values it needs to be. Just return a value which has enough information to know if the user won lost etc then in the main function use this value go print to the user. Dont print in your Nim logic functions.What youll notice if you do this is that tour types make more sense. You are doing more targeted actions in functions with clear input  output. Youll notice all IO actions printing and reading and done completely separate to Nim logic. Also everything should be more neat and tidy ,haskell,cltzyef,1,t5_2qh36

2574229,0,t3_2p0a5o,I have to say that the more I work with hedis the more I am unpleased with it. Its types are hard to understand. Instead of having all the commands return something like Command ByteString or Command Int results and giving a way to run them they provide a result that is dependent on context giving us types like m f ByteString. I find this to be hard to understand for a newbie. I should say I havent tried to implement alternative way yet  But I hope someone will do that eventually.Secondly errorhandling the right way is almost impossible. If you for example want to catch all errors of this code    runRedis  multiExec  do        set a b        set c d        ...you need to convert it into something like    res lt runRedis  multiExec  do        r lt set a b        r lt set c d        ...        return r r ...    check res and then all r r ... for errorsI find that it would be much better to either have an exceptionbased solution here or to automatically gather all responses and check them for an error in a monad returning single Either Error Answer at the end.One more thing I had about hedis. First it will currently not save you from error protocol usage. You can call sadd foo  empty array and you will get an error transaction aborted if used with transaction.

2631274,0,t1_cn1o0oc,Thanks for your excellent comments hastor!Ive been mulling this stuff over for months but reading those two lines gives me new perspective.It sounds like youre more interested in the patternmatching than the forced evaluation aspects.I think your assessment of the potential is realistic.SOP generics is shaperespecting.The seqaid side of things could help test these invariants prepost during execution.More work is definitely needed in deepseqbounded to support this approach.For instance at present a forcing pattern P always matches any term T whose shape is a proper subpattern of P roughly speaking.So theres no way currently to use NFDataP to check the depth of a term.Here are a few tests showing some of the nuances of the present semantics.You need to rebuild deepseqbounded with the WARNPATTERNMATCHFAILURE flag set to True in order to see the match failures.Each of these GHCi lines also echoes the term argument but I edited these out.    gt forcep .. True     gt forcep .. True  x    NFDataP warning instance  bad PatNode child list    NFDataP warning couldnt match WR having children Node WS Node WW     gt forcep ...     gt forcep .....     gt forcep ......     gt forcep .....     gt forcep ......     NFDataP warning instance a bad PatNode child list    NFDataP warning couldnt match WR having children Node WS Node WS Node WS The change would not be hard to implement but its pretty fundamental and wants consideration.I guess rather than modifying of terms by setting select subterms to undefined as is done in many of the deepseqbounded tests you could take the complementary approach and have a pattern node type which raises an exception when hit.Then you have a noninvasive means of gauging the shape of the term being forced.Ive started a ticket or two around this.,haskell,cn21id0,1,t5_2qh36

2894225,0,t3_2s97d0,I am very hopeful about supercompilation as a truly powerful optimisation technique.  But I have to report that after three years of Maxs PhD work and Max is a seriously intelligent and productive guy we didnt get it working to the point where it could be considered a routine optimisation.  Research is like that.On the plus side we learned a LOT.  I found the supercompilation literature to be inspiring but really hard to understand in detail.  This may be my shortcoming but it may also be a shortcoming that others share.  I feel quite proud of the work that Max did on understanding modularising and explaining supercompilation our Supercompilation by evaluation paper is one example.  But that was just the beginning. Maxs thesis same link is an amazing piece of work and describes a series of innovations that we explored. So why isnt it in GHC?  Read Maxs thesis!  I think the tldr is this we couldnt find a robust way of a getting the performance gains the supercompilation offers without b getting vast code bloat often in cases where it is entirely unnecessary.Max has moved on to other things now.  To me the field seems wide open.  Before wading in do read the thesis. But perhaps a bit more persistence and ingenuity will succeed where we failed.Simon,haskell,cnx2saj,3,t5_2qh36

Now you are talking about the behavior of an operation in terms of the internal structure of a Foldable rather than algebraic properties.

That is if I write    foo  Foldable f gt f a gt ...Foldable contributes nothing to any reasoning I can do note the absence of any other constraints on f.

You need to turn all these pointers into a contiguous array so you can pass it along to another foreign function.A good compromise might be to additionally provide in Foreign.Marshal.Array allocation functions that dropped the Storable requirement and took a additional size and alignment parameter that told them how far to push the pointer as its filling up the array.,haskell,col7x0t,2,t5_2qh36

3574546,0,t1_cpzotew,Personally I found syntactic presentations of parametricity a little more compelling then the denotational approach taken in Wadlers paper. Due to the fact that Wadler confines himself to just a couple of pages to formalize parametricity the proofsformalization has always seemed lacking in detail to me. Bob Harpers book outlines a more thorough syntactic approach the chapter is actually called Parametricity in the draft. Its a little complicated but the proof is a lot more fleshed out then whats in this paper and significantly longer. Finally since parametricity is really just a theorem stating that a logical relation is reflexive it may be worth your while to investigate logical relations. Karl Crary has a chapter on them in Advanced topics in types and PL there are a ton of other good reads in that book Harper talks about them over the course of several chapters in his book.

3574630,0,t1_cpznzqb,Yes.  They are a smell of the Haskell language in the sense that if you had a perfect language already you wouldnt need language pragmas.  Theres a catch though.  These language pragmas and the broader spirit of embracing evolution are also the main reason Haskell can be simultaneously a principled language and still relevant at  years old.  Without this Haskell would be a footnote in a few programming language textbooks as an example of a dead language that might have influenced some languages that are actually still used.There has been a lot of effort in the last  years or so to standardize the better parts of common Haskell language extensions.  Haskell the standard language hardly changed at all for about  years from  to  instead blossoming into a million extensions where everyone tried their own things some died and some lived.  Then Haskell started to push in the direction of making some decisions again and catching up the Haskell Report.Is it going fast enough?  Who knows!  The sense of the older part of the Haskell community though is that making a mistake and adding the wrong thing to the specification is far far worse than making people add a language pragma for a few more years while we gather data and make sure.

4372844,0,t1_csii3d6,EDIT I was corrected on a number of points here and while I still support deprecating the platform in favor of stack it is because stack is easier more flexible and makes the right decisions out of the box not because there are fundamental limitations with the Haskell Platform. Pin and bless can be used interchangeably since you cant install two versions of a library sidebyside. Idiomatic use of GHCcabal requires sandboxing if any package on you system is incompatible with any other. Activatehs has no notion of managing userlevel or sandboxlevel packages. Im sure switching out these  libraries wont break anything else! Cabal wouldnt need those warnings if it handled sandboxing rather than just support it. And upgrading most certainly means a wipe if you dont want your userlevel packages to break.You can hack around this by writing custom scripts that store and retrieve userlevel installs with each installed version of Haskell Platform but that still doesnt solve the sandboxing issue. For that you either need to sandbox everything and take the disk spacecompilation time hit or share sandboxes between packages that work on the same version.But by that point youd realize that thats exactly what stack does and you wouldnt be debating this with me.Stack is a solution not an alternative and youre being disingenuous by treating Haskell Platform as something that isnt strictly inferior to stack.,haskell,csijzim,1,t5_2qh36

4446872,0,t1_csr6vxt,gt This just seems like you are complicating the matter in order to be misleading on purpose.No. Im endeavoring to explain why my bounds and the ones that lpsmith offered disagree and to distinguish between the word size w and the alphabet size  that arise in a radix sort because if you dont take the more complicated analysis above then they are easily conflated.Given a list of strings R every algorithm that is capable of sorting it must pay at least LCPR. Where LCPR is the amount of the strings you must inspect to disambiguate them.Period. Game over. I cant escape that bound. Nobody can. So I cant sort strings in On time unless LCPR  On. One situation that happens in is when were sorting fixed sized integers with a fixed number of radix passes.On the other hand when the strings are random like youve requested the expected value of the longest common prefix involved becomes    ELCPR  On log nSo the bounds I gave become a randomized upper bound     On log n  n log   On log nand were bounded below with a randomized bound of     LCPR  n log nSoA. No.B. No.No paradox is introduced and the universe doesnt collapse.On the other hand what I am saying is that the complexity involved here is less than that of a symbolcomparison sort under other input distributions. Then the complexity here    OLCPR  n log can dominate the achievable complexity of any pairwise symbol based string sort    LCPR  n log nId like to point out that the questions you asked are merely about random strings however where the LCPR term dominates while the bounds I gave above hold in all situations.If we take N  LCPR then the OLCPR  n log  complexity bound on MSD radix sorting is linear in N as we can absorb the n log  bound into the coefficient for N as log  is a constant and n lt LCPR. We get no such collapse for the lower bound on symbolwise comparison. We only have n lt LCPR so I can only get a sloppier bound n log n lt N log N so in those terms if we collapse the terms together to get a single variable    LCPR  n log n  ON  N log N  ON log Nand then were talking ON for radix techniques vs ON log N for comparison based techniques. Our equation now only involve one variable.But notice that N  n log n under your assumptions of randomness. The latter bound was made sloppy by merging the two terms  devolved to an O making it useless.In the case you are interested in when our strings are random we can see the tighter one variable bound    LCPR  n log n  n log n  n log n  n log nfor symbolwise comparisons agrees with that for radixstyle comparison.In my original description the n was N  LCPR not the number of strings.I included the more detailed breakdown above not to throw up dust but to explain why were starting with the same facts and yielding different conclusions.,haskell,csr7q2h,6,t5_2qh36
4479171,0,t1_csv804e,A monad is a math object. However you can see it as a way to abstract sequencing and isolation. A monad allows you to wrap something in it. The only way you have to extract it to is to bind it to a monadic function that will take the value out of the monad and rewraps it into the same monad.For the IO monad sequencing is like sequencing in imperative language. In the Maybe monad sequencing checks whether the Maybe value equals Nothing. If so it doesnt call the next functions on it. It can be used with computations that can fail with no error message. The Either monad can be used with computations that can fail with error message.The idea is that binding in order to sequence is the Haskell gtgt operator and wrapping is called pure or return.   return  Monad m gt a gt m a   gtgt  Monad m gt m a gt a gt m b gt m bAs you can see the only way you can access the a value is to bind it  c.f. gtgt  and rewrap it inside m as b  m b.,haskell,csv9n9w,0,t5_2qh36

4484656,0,t1_csvxoff,You can work your way through all of the statements folks make in a CPO about | in the vocabulary you are using here. It gets pretty tedious as the problems grow more complicated however.The benefit of the | vocabulary is we can simply say that all functions are monotone. That is to say for something like Bool we have | False True  as inhabitants with | lt False | lt True and every function from Bool to Bool is monotone with respect to this ordering. So e.g. if you take | gt | you can do whatever you like for False or True but if you take | gt True then you must also take False gt True and True gt True.Simply stating that all functions are monotone or more properly talking about functions being Scott continuous carries with it a lot of meaning about how |s must be treated in your language! You could of course build up all that machinery using a different vocabulary but youd lose all the existing terminology and tools of CPOs and the like.These tools are already well studied in other areas and let us borrow results from areas like lattice theory rather than force us to make up terminology and tooling as we go and it makes it easy to formally talk about things like one function is more defined than another just in terms of reasoning about partial orders.As a friend of mine likes to say continuity means nothing weird happens at infinity. A large part of the genius of Dana Scotts original work on dcpos and denotational semantics is that the notion of continuity that he built up is good enough to make a ton of nontrivial problems just vanish. The mappings between any two dcpos themselves form a dcpo giving us a nice cartesian closed category so it looks like turtles all the way downCould you build all of this up explicitly? Probably but itd get to be a pain in the ass to actually work with once you started dealing with recursion. Moreover youd have to make up your own vocabulary for everything and then pretty much anything you published in the field of denotational semantics nobody would be able to read.,haskell,csvyes7,10,t5_2qh36

The a person asked the question why not Clojure to which he got the above reply. In the context of the whole discussion what I said is hardly a troll. At least no more than saying its a waste of time trying to explain null values to someone.  edit And actually since I posted that to HN over a year ago Ive seen a few talks on Haskell that perhaps have slightly adapted my view. There was some talk I cant seem to find now where the users encoded quite a bit of business logic into Haskell types. Thats pretty awesome. They also built some sort of serializable code thing based on some modifications to GHC. Pretty epic stuff. So perhaps we should just sum up that HN thread as cool people write cool stuff in Clojure and Haskell I prefer dynamic languages some prefer types. Lets go write cool stuff.,haskell,cu9hges,0,t5_2qh36

4930757,0,t3_3iesxa,I dont know of any such attempts but it would be interesting.Pure FP could certainly make the core domain implementation cleaner and subject to proofs and reasoning and serious verification and stuff. What Ive seen of domain modelling in EHR software is pretty incoherent and working in that industry helped convince me that OO generally confuses more than it helps.If I were to make an EHR system Id build it as an appendonly set of event logs event sourcing. And Id definitely focus on small clinics and not big hospitals because the big hospitals AFAIK need an ungodly amount of integrations.There are some startups making EHR software with nicer interfaces but generally I think the UIs of the established packages are barely usable. In the country in which I worked the frustration caused by such UIs was the subject of national discussion and when I talked to people in medicine I felt vaguely apologetic on behalf of the whole industry. So I think there are lots of opportunities for huge improvements.I would also think seriously about a semidecentralized model with coherent support for at least temporary offline operation because central outages are incredibly bad... they can basically stop a whole hospital. Thinking in a decentralized way from the start will probably also help with scaling to bigger installations.Oh yeah and any new EHR system now needs to be mobilefriendly.,haskell,cug27da,2,t5_2qh36

5000188,0,t1_cuoaio3,Maybe this is missing some subtle details but I think of fix as the ability to refer to yourself inside your definition factored out into a function. Instead of supporting selfreference in our language we could just provide fix and would be able to express all the same things.With this in mind we can go from a recursive definition to a fix version systematically. Take this ugly fib function for example    fib n  if n   || n   then n else fib n    fib n  We can write a nonrecursive version of this logic by replacing each recursive reference to fib with an extra parameter    nonRec n recurse        if n   || n   then n else recurse n    recurse n  In a sense we have the same function definition except we punted on how to recurse leaving it as a parameter. We can then let fix do the recursion for us    fib n  fix nonRec nThe important insight is that we can use this same procedure for all simple examples of selfreference. Give it a try!So fix is recursion factored out into a function. With this in mind the definition of fix makes more sense. It takes in a function whose parameter is supposed to refer to the function itselfand it does this by passing in a recursive call to fix f into the function.    let fix f  f fix fOkay maybe that wasnt the most rigorous explanation but it helped me understand fix better.footnotes Actually we might need some additional combinators to cover more complex cases like mutual recursion and polymorphic recursion. Im not entirely sure if we can cover these cases with just plain fix. Dealing with these would distract from building up your intuition. Besides I dont want to think too hard about the more complex versions right now P.polymorphic recursion ,haskell,cuopkkf,4,t5_2qh36

Neither gloss nor threepennygui are available on stackage. Last time I tried to use libraries outside of stackage with stack resulted in stack build spitting a bunch of lines I supposed to add to stack.yaml manually!. When I did add them stack build spit out a bunch of more lines and after couple of more iterations of that loop it finally refused to build anything at all and Im not even mentioning the fact that if youre using external libraries in the app youre building you have to add them both to stack.yaml and .cabal file.Im not sure thats supposed to be beginnerfriendly behaviour.none of this seems like inherent limitation of stack so just consider that to be semiconstructive feedback on how to make it better for some use cases,haskell,cv52aei,11,t5_2qh36

5373251,0,t1_cvydcvd,As far as I can tell FP Complete have always been in the consulting market and the tooling was only ever a means to the end of making it smoother for companies to adopt haskell to whom they can then sell consultancy andor custom solutions. Im sure someone from FP Complete can put me straight there if Im wrong. FP Centre is scheduled for demise but you should be aware that stack is open source and under control of the Commercial Haskell SIG while FP Complete still provide most of the resources. I consider that reasonably sandboxed. If and when FP Complete stop supporting stack I hope that either a new lead developer from the community is found apparently plenty of people are contributing at the moment and maybe some of them will grow to become  major contributors or cabal has caught up in terms of speed ease of use defaulting to best practices and robustness. Itll be a happy day for us all if cabal becomes as beginner and business friendly as stack is today. By contrast FP Centre was never open source. usnoyberg is on record in another thread inviting email from someone who wanted to save FP Centre but I worry slightly that its a fond hope that someone would continue it rather than the beginning of a concrete and serious plan for its future.

Ive read Edwards posts but I dont really see anything there that sounds like a reason that we would want these instances declared base.Instead hes saying a lot of things about understanding of Hask as a category.  But crucially the ability to reason about a category doesnt depend on defining instances in the language.  The lack of a defined Functor instance for  a doesnt stop anyone from thinking about any categorytheoretic construction they choose or from calling Hask a cartesian closed category or anything like that.  We can understand that this does form a valid endofunctor of Hask as a category... and then choose not to define it and that conclusion doesnt become any less valid.,haskell,cw08g99,2,t5_2qh36
5389996,0,t1_cw0lrmk,In my personal experiment with ML typecheckers I used the two forms for lttype variablesgt in and some lttype variablesgt in to bind rigid and flexible variables respectively.

My other reply was indeed a clarification however we disagree in that you think the confusion is due to Gabriels article being misleading while I attribute it to your interpretation of it.gtThat is not a problem of type classes in general neither this approach solves many limitations of type classes .Gabriels argument is that the way type classes work leads to awkwardness in some specific scenarios such as. When a type offers multiple reasonable targets for mapping e.g. Functor and Either. When embracing the only possible instance for a type has unintuitive consequences e.g. Foldable and pairs and. When kind mismatches make an intuitively appealing use of a class impossible e.g. Functor and ByteString.Gabriel then presents lensbased alternatives for handling those scenarios while suggesting the advantages of such an approach. He is not claiming that type classes are fatally flawed and that we should avoid them wherever possible. All the article points out in that respect is that in some situations classes are not an ideal solution which I believe is not at all a controversial stance.By the waygtsince yourself or your other youself has had to clarify to a newbie exactly the kind of confusion that I denounceHow do you know that cwraith is a newbie?,haskell,cw5k4st,6,t5_2qh36

5901182,0,t1_cxt58cm,To answer your points in orderYes errors are caught at compile time like in C. However Haskells type system and Cs type system are extremely different. I cant really cover all the differences but Ill mention a result of them. In C there is often a need to cast void to another type of pointer. This is subverts the type system and can cause a segfault at runtime. Doing this is very similar to using unsafeCoerce in haskell but in haskell this practice is way less common because the type system ends up keeping up with things better. Thats a very poor explanation but its the best my feeble mind can muster.I use yesod and persistent with postgres for the backend. I also use a ton of other libraries but I think those are the ones you were asking about.The most mindblowing moments I had were Realizing that you can accomplish a lot with immutable data Understanding partial function application Understanding the expression problem.

6042073,0,t1_cyb5zce,gt In theory the stackstackage solution is less work total because even though some people are working hard to keep things working the end users benefit by just having things work. With cabalinstall there is less upfront work but results in lots of individual users having to solve problems on their own when things dont work?Yeah Id say thats pretty accurate.  The amount of actual maintenance work on packages is essentially the same in either case.  The difference is when you get notified of the breakage and so also when it gets resolved.  With stackage breakages are detected and resolved early.  For packages outside of it things tend to get fixed when users complain.  Detecting these breakages earlier improves the health of hackage in general and it means that cabalinstalls build plans are more likely to work out for recent hackage packages than they were prestackage.The cabalinstall approach leads to Maintainers better get everything  correct otherwise users are going to feel the pain.  Stacks approach is Maintainers cant get everything  correct lets shield users from these issues.  Perhaps this could be resolved with adequate tooling for determining version constraints.  However right now it takes a lot of effort to maintain broad version bounds and ensure that they are correct for every release.  It seems like many folks just throw in the towel and put down gt versionimusing ampamp lt bumpedversion.The main concern Ive heard about Stack is that it makes it easier to omit or use incorrect version constraints in cabal files.  The source of this concern is that stack allows you to have no version constraints in your cabal file and have the build still work.  However this is also true of cabalinstall.  If you leave all the constraints off of packages roughly speaking cabalinstall will try to use the most recent versions.  If these packages are all in stackage building will probably succeed.It is the package maintainers responsibility to add appropriate version bounds.  If anything issues with version bounds are now way more tractable as you are dealing with an explicit set of dependencies rather than a point in the space of version choices which keeps on changing under your feet.Additionally lets say that hypothetically stack did cause hackage packages to have less accurate cabal version constraints.  I for one would much rather have a world where we can reliably build our code and where newcomers arent discouraged by their initial attempts at getting things working.  Being able to deliver a project and allbutguarantee that it will build a few years from now is HUGE for using Haskell in an industrial setting.Being able to sometimes use older packages along with newer packages is simply not worth skipping out on these benefits.  Good news is that we dont sacrifice this and the concern over stack negatively affecting version constraints seems to me to be FUD.,haskell,cybmizm,1,t5_2qh36

7168054,1,t3_4dny3v,Which to choose in your situation depends very much on what you want to achieve. Heres the guideline Id offerPick Python If   You are not terribly interested in programming for its own sake but rather solving a particular oneoff problem like crunching numbers on a dataset to get some statistical info   You want to write scripts here and there to help you do mindless tasks but not any serious large applications.   The above things mostly apply and you have contact with other Python programmersfriendsThe reason is that Python will get you decently far without as much upfront effort. However once you start to get serious about programming Python and the mental structures that come with it will start to be a big hindrance. Its like a bike. You can afford one easily enough but youll never go  MPH on one. To be honest people do amazing things in Python but its sort of the heylookmomnohands kind of amazing Honey you get down from there right now!Pick Haskell If   You want to see the depth and beauty of programming and youre in it for the longhaul   You arent in any particular rush   You have access to other Haskell programmers i.e. plant yourself firmly on haskellbeginners IRC channelIf you choose Haskell I would recommend you simply buy from haskellbook.com and just do whatever it says.

Going down that road too far just gets you to lt x as syntactic sugar for unsafePerformIO which no one wants.The easy answer is to make a rule that limits scope inside an inline do bind to the scope at the top level of the enclosing do block immediately before this statement.

But note that what you say is fine there are explicit encoders for individually sized types so you can be explicit. Also sure Word technically is Word on a bit platform but you cant know that unless you unbox it personally. So if you encode a bit word on a  bit platform you can read it back later  its strictly encoded as a bit integer in the readwrite paths at the user level.The code is also currently broken on  bit architectures and fixing that is mostly tedious but I havent gotten around to it.

Our first target is to support GHC ..s Haskell and then optimize the heck out of it. I envision GHCVM to be a buffer between GHC and the mainstream. I imagine that well have a lag with GHCs release cycle by about  months to allow newer GHC versions to settle down and wait for the libraries on Hackage to accommodate the new changes if required. In essence we will support a newer version of GHC whenever we feel that new version is production ready. This will allow companies who depend on GHCVM to do a safe upgrade to the newer version of GHCs Haskell.Im not sure how much of a problem the drastic updates to GHC would be since I would imagine such companies would confine themselves to a given version of GHC and not worry about the newer releases.

Theres a whole lot of directions to go and connections to make in this and no one intuition is the right one. Applicatives are monoids in the category of copresheaves with Day convolution so its probably the case that coapplicative endofunctors are monoids in the category of presheaves. These concepts also relate to representable and corepresentable functors and so called logarithms of types. One neat application of Distributive is in Ed s linear library where distribute acts to transpose matrices. That might be a good way to gain intuition for it.

8294219,0,t3_4suhx9,I skimmed parts of the article  and felt that it was knocking down a bit of a strawman.   I mean  for a toy problem  the example code was ok  it got the job done  but I didnt feel it was amazingly clever either.If we really have to discuss this particular toy problem  my favorite solution is one of the many monoidish style solutions that you can google.As for trying to anticipate future changes to your code   well in many cases Im not so sure thats all that worthwhile.   One of the best ways to manage future changes is to develop a tasteful API that seperates concerns andor solves a more general problem  then write specific solutions in that API.  But if you dont really understand what the general problem actually is  you are likely to end up nowhere  with a solution that generalizes the wrong things.   Good API design is hard work  and often requires real insight.   Its a great thing when a better API comes along and simplifies and disentangles your code  but that doesnt happen every day.Anyway  this type of thing really isnt too important in the small  its only as your code grows that you really want to think about how to refactor.  For example  heres my suggestion for how to implement an imperative Round Robin interface I posted to rhaskell a while back.   As someone quite rightly pointed out  one can easily imagine extending the API in various ways that would result in drastically changing the implementation.    But  this is an abstract interface  and theres so little code there that its no big deal.,haskell,d5ec4f7,2,t5_2qh36

8451140,0,t3_4uvrsp,According to the prime number theorem the density of primes around n tends towards proportionality with logn.  That means that the odds that a random number of the magnitude   is about  million.  But how to prove it?  My first instinct unless the number to be tested was of a special form would be to just start with trial remainders.  Not trial divisioncalculating the actual quotient is both unnecessary and extremely expensive for very large numbers.So how to calculate ab  c mod p where a b and c may be very large numbers?  First mod down a and b which will give you small integers.  Unless the modded down a equals  a case easily handled separately the modded down a will be a member of the cyclic multiplicative group of Zp.  The order of that group is p so you can mod down b by p Fermats Little Theorem.So after the modding down you are left with an object consisting of a handful of numbers smaller than the p you are trialremaindering by.  Such an object is trivially calculated.  As your test p grows you may want to employ binary exponentiation to increase performance and avoid the risk of intermediate result overflow.,haskell,d5xxgci,1,t5_2qh36

8948105,0,t1_d7n7eho,On this page theres a series of lectures by John Hughes called Monads and All That. What it covers is broadly consistent with aleksejslvanovs advice  certainly no vague misleading metaphors. It goes a bit beyond monads too. Dont worry about the scary allthisabstractweirdnessthatIdidntknowprogramminglanguagesandcompilerscouldinvolve stuff on that page  this particular series is at a level an experienced nonHaskell programmer should have few problems with. However Im not sure it goes back to the level of explaining typeclasses  I think so but I dont remember. So...The next years page includes a series of lectures by Simon Peyton Jones called Adventures with types in Haskell. Although it covers some compiler internals and more recent Haskell features in the second lecture onwards the first lecture is again pretty introductory and gives IIRC a very good explanation of typeclasses.Both SPJ and JH are extremely good teachers and I strongly recommend watching both sets of lectures.Theres also a set of lectures by Erik Meijer on the Microsoft Channel  site Haskell tag  click through to the second and third pages  which are a slower but also excellent introduction to Haskell generally  including typeclasses lecture  and monads lecture .Also look at SPJs publications here Theres a document Tackling the Awkward Squad  that gives basic explanations of monadic IO concurrency exceptions and the C foreign function interface. It does use at least one metaphor the worldpassing model for IO but I find that one quite helpful and its not entirely a metaphor  the compiler even has a token representing the world in the intermediate language. The danger of course that very much applied in my case is seeing something too similar to that in all monads not just the IOlike ones or even just the ones with some concept of a state. I finally got over that hurdle when I figured out the monad interface to Maybe and how to use it.One thing all these have in common  theyre all a bit dated. Those concepts havent changed but Haskell has changed relatively recently particularly to have more generic operations by default rather than concrete list operations. There has also been some slight rearrangement of the hierarchy of library typeclasses  some things that should always have been related but werent for historical reasons now are. IMO thats not a big deal but Hoogle and its links to the GHC and library manuals are useful uptodate reference sources.,haskell,d7nfhks,4,t5_2qh36

How long have you been gone for?It sure seems like the community and industry adoption are both growing judging by this subreddits activity and the number of blog posts from industry that Ive seen. redditmetrics shows steady growth of the community here for whatever thats worth.I think one of the most influential changes in the language ecosystem has been stack which solves a lot of the difficulties people used to encounter with cabal although cabal is still working on improving things too.Another recent development Ive found pretty exciting is the maturation of ghcjs which lets you run haskell code in the browser. I think its fair to say that the ecosystem around ghcjs is still relatively immature but the core seems really solid and things look to be growing pretty quickly here.Im not really sure where we most need to improve next. The answer for most languages most of the time seems to be tooling and thats probably true here. The elusive haskell IDE still hasnt taken off but the emacs side of things seems to be getting better with tools like spacemacs see also the haskell layer and intero leksah seems to be steadily improving as a dedicated haskell IDE but I havent personally tried it out yet.,haskell,d81gs64,32,t5_2qh36

Meanwhile the community here on reddit seems to be expanding. The community on IRC I think is mostly stable with some slow growth. I dont really have a pulse on the other communities.gt Is there more adoption from the industry?It seems that way I see more startups that want to use Haskell and there are more Haskelllike languages out in the world these days like PureScript and Ermine.gt Are you satisfied with general technical direction taken by the language? Where should we go next?Mostly. Id like to see better libraries in specific places and support for more platforms. So for instance Id like more libraries and better support for building traditional applications. We have Gtkhs but I think thats just a start. We have GHCJS and now the GHCJVM backend. Id also like to see a GHC .NET.Id like to see more strict IO functions in base. Id also like to see text in base.Row types and effect systems are hot and interesting right now. Id like to see some research into adding those to Haskell as extensions.gt What is the biggest roadblock for further developmentadoption?Thats a good question and Im not sure if Im a good person to try answering it.

Its not layout sensitive which is easier for tool support and reformatting.  Its not even newline sensitive which makes it even easier to reformat for example the J key in Vim always preserves the validity of my code. Explicit recursion means I can use shadowing instead of having to use a series of slightly different identifiers when writing a series of transformations in pointful style.

I solved it a month or two later and released discrimination .. with it implemented.Basically the goal is to provide    disc grouping  Grouping a gt ab gt bthat executes in linear time productively grouping inputs into equivalence classes output in the order they are encountered based on the first half of the pair.    becomes    but the key is that each output is determined in a tricky cooperative manner to avoid paying the costs On log n or On costs youd have to if you implemented this more directly using laziness.This lets you have things like linear time nub.The package also supplies disc sorting with a similar type signature but where the equivalence classes are outputted sorted by a rather than in the order they are encountered. This is less productive in that you typically have to consume the entire input before it can start producing answers whereas disc grouping starts producing the output list as soon as it has seen the first input and each output equivalence class in the result is available as soon as possible mathematically.Grouping is possible for basically any interesting haskell data type that has a real structural Eq including some shocking things like IORefs.

10230680,0,t1_dc2s5r2,I wont respond to your comment in full but I will respond to its bookendsgtThe beauty of using sexpressions for a language is that you automatically get all of these alternative representations for free programmers just need to add the relevant foogtsexpression preprocessor to their Makefile or write a bash alias or use an alternative shebang or whatever. In principle the same thing can also be applied to output like error messages etc. if they were represented structurally.gt ...gt Whilst I accept that many people dont want to write code directly as sexpressions I do think it would be an improvement if the first step in such languages build pipeline translates into some sexpression format or equivalent but might as well standardise in such a way that it can be manipulated arbitrarily by intermediate steps i.e. fragments of optimised AST scattered around some compiled binarys memory layout dont count!I think this oversells the benefit of what amounts to using a publicfacing serializable IR. If the transformation is nontrivial then error messages for any surface representations will be hard to generate or hard to read this is even true if both syntaxes are entirely sexp based! and the noncanonical surface syntaxes will lag in quality and popularity.It also undervalues the importance of interacting with other peoples code where you may have a different preferred surface syntax or not have their bespoke macro system hooked into your editor. The extreme case of this would require projects in such a language to commit editor adapter plugins if they wanted any contributions.,haskell,dc3pdwj,1,t5_2qh36

10415622,0,t1_dcn1zsy,The list monad is mostly useful when you allow MonadPlus methods like guard. This allows you to specify conditions on continuation. For example the following is a list of all natural numbers up to a given count    naturalsTo x ..xI can express give me all pairs of natural numbers up to x like    naturalsPaired n  do        x lt naturalsTo n        y lt naturalsTo n        pure x yBut that gives us a lot of   and   entries. So we want to omit entries where that is the case and we do that by introducing a guard. guard only allows the process to continue when the condition is True.    naturalsPaired n  do        x lt naturalsTo n        y lt naturalsTo n        guard x  y        pure x y        This pairs up without   etc.Lets solve some project euler. Problem  is special pythagorean triplet. The problem asserts There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a  b  c  . Find the product abc. Lets find it with list monad!First we start with all the natural numbers up to  since it cant be larger than that. c is the largest number so we draw it first. Then we grab b which must be less than c.    specialTriplet  do        c lt naturalsTo         b lt naturalsTo c          a lt naturalsTo b  Now we have c b and a in scope and were satisfying the property that a lt b lt c. Now we want to ensure that a  b  c.      specialTriplet  do        c lt naturalsTo         b lt naturalsTo c          a lt naturalsTo b          guard a  b  cFinally we want to ensure that a  b  c  .    specialTriplet  do        c lt naturalsTo         b lt naturalsTo c          a lt naturalsTo b          guard a  b  c        guard a  b  c  And then we can return the product    specialTriplet  do        c lt naturalsTo         b lt naturalsTo c          a lt naturalsTo b          guard a  b  c        guard a  b  c          pure a  b  cSo this is a really natural expression of the problem.

10870610,0,t3_5vdj40,Do you understand the Functor typeclass?One way to generalize Functor is to be a Functor on two type arguments    class Bifunctor p where      bimap  a gt b gt c gt d gt p a c gt p b d      first  a gt b gt p a c gt p b c      second  b gt c gt p a b gt p a c    instance Bifunctor  where      bimap f g a b  f a g b    instance Bifunctor Either where      bimap f  Left a  Left f a      bimap  g Right b  Right g bBasically with Bifunctor you can map over both sides of a Either or Tuple or any similar sort of type.Theres another sort of way to generalize a Functor though  flipping around the function that you pass around to fmap which gives you a Contravariant Functor    class Contravariant f where      contramap  a gt b gt f b gt f a Basically in a Functor the function a gt b is applied to data thats contained inside the Functor or is the result of a computation that the Functor represents  for example to the data inside a list or to the result of an IO computation.  By contrast a Contravariant functor the function a gt b gets applied to the input to the computation the Contravariant represents.  One of the simplest Contravariants to understand is the Contravariant for Predicates a gt Bool.  In that case you essentially have something like    contramap  b gt a gt a gt Bool gt b gt BoolA Profunctor is what you get if you smash those  generalizations together.  Its a bifunctor thats contravariant on the first type.Basically its some type that you can map over both input and output.  The simplest type that maps to this is gt.  Theres a number of other Profunctors though.  For example you can define a Profunctor for newtype Kleisli m a b  Kleisli  runKleisli  a gt m b .  Or for data LeftFold a b  forall s.

You can write everything with one with the other. That said where is part of a statement while let is an expression where scopes over |s this means this refactoring is actually potentially a pain in the ass.    foo c      | isAlpha c  ...      | isPunctuation c  ...     where        ...    foo xs  xscan share where definitions across guards. where is part of the statement of this pattern match whereas let is an expression on the right hand side of the . So to rewrite all the code you have written with where you might have to change the way the pattern matching is done and guards are set up. Pattern matching will backtrack and cascade down to other cases below if all the guards fail.On the other hand writing all your code with where rather than let can require you to make new helper functions to attach the where clauses to.

Somewhat paradoxically LIFO queueing with a fixed buffer length and push back or failure after that is usually the best choice for network servers.

11336224,0,t1_dfgp8no,You might be interested in the expression problem. I can try to give a brief summaryWe can exemplify adhoc polymorphism by building a simple domain specific language.    data Expr  Lit Int                      | Add Expr Expr    eval Lit a  a    eval Add a b  eval a  eval bWe could extend the language along two axis  add a new expression type like multiplication or add a new evaluation function like pretty printing.Writing functions that pattern match on the tag of adts like this makes it easy to add new functions. We could add pretty printing in a new module without recompiling our old code. Using type classes makes it easy to add new cases like multiplication. This is similar to adding a new subclass in oop and we can do it without touching old code.If we want to add a new case when using adts or new functions with type classes we have to change our existing code though.There are also ways to make our dsl extensible for both functions and cases.

Not of course that reasoning from tenuous analogy and traditional sayings is particularly rigorous in the first place  but its probably marginally better than reasoning from their inverse...,haskell,dfrkwwd,1,t5_2qh36
11448131,0,t1_dftmgco,This is because the binaries have yet to be built. This is a candidate rc not even rc. The email which was circulated only to GHC developers was for the purpose of getting binary maintainers to try and build the binaries for the different platforms. Once this is done and the issues are solved then would rc binaries be provided.As it stands this public release was premature and is using a version of the compiler that will likely soon be superseded. Its equivalent to providing just a random build of the tree.,haskell,dftmwev,2,t5_2qh36

11488806,0,t3_63yr6f,Im not so sure about this particular example but I wouldnt mind to see some libraries on hackage which use more descriptive type variable names. So that I could compare the experience of learning to use and using abckind of package with a more descriptive one.My current theory is that understanding and learning more descriptively labelled packages would be slightly quicker and easier and the same goes for narrowing down understanding and fixing some type errors related to the lib in question.,haskell,dfy96ob,3,t5_2qh36
11502498,0,t1_dfzswnk,Im not sure if hedgehog can guarantee coverage of such edge cases but I think being explicit about the values youre generating certainly helps. In hedgehog youd say x lt forAll  Gen.int Range.linearBounded and it would be obvious youre exercising the entire range of Int.One thing which I have seen bite people over and over again with QuickCheck is that the Arbitrary for Int only has a range of  to . This makes sense in many cases but not always.,haskell,dfzt3uv,2,t5_2qh36
