2574363,0,t3_2p8epk,I have sciatica and have been going to the chiropractor for  months.  He gives me  mins of electropulse therapy followed by an adjustment of my lower back. It feels sore for a day or two but the sciatica subsides. ,Sciatica,cmulvjc,1,t5_2vbe1
2579205,0,t1_cmv83kb,I had heard of its toxicity before. I dont drink and only take tylenol if I really totally absolutely need it since I am breastfeeding and wish to stay as drug free as humanly possible. Tylenol is what they recommend one take when breastfeeding. Weird. ,Sciatica,cmv8nd7,1,t5_2vbe1

3546184,0,t3_30tja6,What really helped me was a hard flat bed with lumbar support. If sciatic pain has origins in the spine then flattening  out the spine to the natural position did best in my recovery. It took me a week of me sleeping on a firm bed improve from being bedridden to being able to walk without limping. In contrast when I was bedridden on a soft bed with no lumbar support my condition worsened with more pain.I noticed my posture was bad when standing  sitting and improving that by two hands reaching for the sky as far as possible nullified the pain at least before moving again.I always felt the swollen feeling along my afflicted right leg. In reality the only part inflamed was my lower back. I always felt that I was swelling up in my right leg when I really wasnt else all the NSAIDs I took would have reduced the swelling. Although at that point my posture was so badpain was so bad my muscles would cramp up contract uncontrollably. When bed ridden I found that I could maneuver moving around doggy style yeah a bad image but the posture a female would assume when doing the sex position. This posture saved my sanity.,Sciatica,cpwhkce,1,t5_2vbe1
3585158,0,t1_cq0osqj,I see.. Im also in that type of situation. The doctors say I have a really large disc herniation and Ive had it for almost six months now. Its been affecting my ability to walk around school to go to my classes. I have to use my crutches every day and now I have atrophy in my legs. I did the exercises and the traction machines too but they hardly helped at all.Did you get your surgery yet? If so how long did it take for you to recover?,Sciatica,cq0xpr5,1,t5_2vbe1
4685852,0,t1_ctl6nwl,Thats what Im doing. Following the rules taking my prescribed meds staying calm. The pain is worrisome. ,Sciatica,ctl73gz,1,t5_2vbe1
9611160,0,t1_d9xcros,Just wanted to ask quickly because I can lie down easily and comfortably but sitting is where I really suffer so when sitting how would you favour your left side so that you can sit longer? For me I can sit for  ish minutes before I have to lie down or stand up because the pain just escalates ,Sciatica,d9xrstp,1,t5_2vbe1

10514545,0,t1_dcziv4v,Yeah I dont have any secrets nor do I say that on my site. I  agree with your concerns and appreciate your feedback. I am passionate about the misguidance that I myself and thousands of other Back Pain suffers get from doctors all over the world. ,Sciatica,dczxpmd,1,t5_2vbe1
10603271,0,t3_5rp96f,I use a pillow in my drivers seat and it helps A LOT! ,Sciatica,dd9nabq,1,t5_2vbe1
11125266,0,t1_demi8n5,I had the same thinglower back issuebut it definitely turned into sciatica because of bulging disc.  If you strain your lower back the disc can press against sciatic nerve which goes to your butt and down your leg so it starts because of a disc bulge but the pain is transferred to your butt and possibly to tingling down the outside of your leg.  If I were in your place I would totally stop lifting weights till I found out what it is.  If it is a bulging disc its a total pain in the neck.  Its sort of like toothpaste coming out of a tube and hoping it will get sucked back in.  I am not a doctor but pretty sure lifting weights could make it worse.Try taking ibuprofin.  If the pain goes away that could point to sciatica because ibuprofin causes inflamation to go down.,Sciatica,det1fn9,1,t5_2vbe1
11225020,0,t3_608dnu,I concur with the previous poster. It doesnt sound like sciatica but it might be neurological. Get to a dr asap once you have insurance! ,Sciatica,df4cbmd,3,t5_2vbe1
11456265,0,t1_dfujyf1,Ill definitely be checking out pillows for sure hahaha.And holy shit thats close. Thats reallyyyy close. That must have been miserable. Aw man I feel bad that you had a few speed bumps on your recovery there. I consider myself lucky the worst thing that happened was throwing up from the meds. Sure I wont be able to have meatballs for the foreseeable future but thats better than this bladder thing. Christ.I just hope weve escaped the worst of it. But if it god forbid happens again Im happy I know who to go to and what needs to be done and what I can expect. That definitely makes it easier.,Sciatica,dfuk5i0,2,t5_2vbe1
11463272,0,t3_63lzu0,Not sciatica but I once spoke with a fitness lecturer about moisture  and apparently moisture can affect arthritis in the knees because the moisture can absorb into them and cause irritation or something like that couldnt tell you exactly maybe this has something to do with your question?,Sciatica,dfvcs7f,2,t5_2vbe1
