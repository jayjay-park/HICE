330193,0,t3_1xvg1h,I was a premed at UVA and will start at UVA Med this fall.  Dont worry about how hard classes will be.  The more important thing is budgeting your time.  Classes in college are quite different than AP classes because there usually arent many small assignments to help float your grade.  For example in Intro Chem there are  exams of  questions each that determine your grade.  In other classes there might be small problem sets but they will at most count toward  of your final grade.  Many classes use a threeexam schedule where the first two count around  of your grade and the last counts about .The best advice to do well in these classes is to stay on top of the material reading about what youre going to learn in class beforehand going to class yeah its usually important and some profs will throw in a question or two on exams to which only students attending class will know the answer and studying diligently for exams.  I crammed and although it was doable I wouldnt recommend it.Good luck stay positive and enjoy your time in college!  UVA is an INCREDIBLE place.  Ive visited many many other undergraduate institutions and UVA is truly a standout place in comparison.,UVA,cfezuqa,6,t5_2rcav

2448056,0,t1_cme72e7,my point was that if we think this was the act of a sociopath its unlikely that its  endemic within the fraternity or across fraternities as has been implied in this and other articles or  endemic across UVa as was implied by the completely inhuman responses of her friends and hallmates supposedly to the full story as laid out in the article. totally agree a psychological component makes sense though not to be used as a defense against any charges. edit didnt catch this before but also I strongly disagree with the blanket generalization that rapists tend to have sociopathic tendencies. its been my experience that people are so desensitized to date rape that those perpetrators can be literally anyone with absolutely no tendencies or warning signs even with the benefit of hindsight. SOME definitely yes and probably many many of those who perpetrate the violent stranger rapes that are much more attentiongrabbing on the news but that arent the biggest problem. ,UVA,cmea8hi,3,t5_2rcav

2490392,0,t1_cmjk28e,gt To my knowledge Phi Psi does not have a documented history of gang rape. There may be accusations of rape and maybe even gang rape in the past but has any of it been proven?If you really cared you could easily find this information for yourself. But since I dont trust you care enough to actually read through that article the TLDR on it is that a woman was gang raped at Phi Psi  years ago and in  her rapist came forward confessed and was convicted. Is that enough proof for you or do you think the confessor is lying too?gt At this stage given all the holes in the story I believe that it is at best the story is greatly embellished by either Jackie or Erdley.What holes in the story? Im actually curious because I keep hearing this but have yet to see anyone point out any real holes. I have no doubt that some of the details were likely embellished by Erdley for dramatic effect like implying that it was a part of the pledge process. Rolling Stone always does that. That being said I seriously doubt that the larger facts of the story are fabricated or at least I have no reason to believe that at this point in time.gt Finally I ask do you Rolling Stone Magazine Erdley or Jackie expect that after publishing an important story like this I am not entitled to openly question the authenticity of the story until it is fact checked by the police?You are absolutely entitled to withhold judgment until more information is available. But thats not what youre doing at all. Youve already basically stated without a real reason that I can see that you believe the story is probably fabricated. Additionally youve clearly made very little effort to research the issue to make an informed opinion. In fact given that you werent even aware of the case I linked to in the first paragraph I can safely say you never even read the original Rolling Stone article and yet here you sit making judgments about it.,UVA,cmjms31,-9,t5_2rcav
2505441,0,t1_cmlkt0t,Most colleges have decided that they are not going to try to enforce a y.o. drinking age. Most of the moversandshakers of society dont agree with it. Its just there to make the prohibitionists happy.That said most colleges are really strict about a fraternity actually providing alcohol to underage people. Essentially the attitude is that it is okay for the kids to drink but they need to provide it on their own. The reason for the party registration is so that the university usually through IFC can police against common supply and violation of other rules.Just to give an example I was on my campus newspaper staff and one party weekend I noticed lots of people standing up on halfadozen different fraternity house roofs watching their bands. Bad sport that I am I urged the IFC to pass a rule against this and they did and so if they went around and drunk people were out on the frathouse roof they would be fined or put on probation. Thats the type of thing the party patrol is looking for.Just remember the rules are passed and put into place by the students themselves under pressure and guidance from the administration. These kids are not about to ban liquor entirely because they happen to like to take a drink themselves. But they will pass and enforce reasonable safety rules and that is a good thing. And that is why every party is absolutely going to get registered on most campuses because it takes little effort and the consequences of not doing so are pretty bad.,UVA,cmlllbw,2,t5_2rcav

8495871,0,t3_4vjiyj,Good for you for thinking about your future now and a future in academia at that.  For what its worth Im doing a PhD in the humanities not Classics though I know some people in the Classics program and the people that come into our program come from all over the place in terms of undergrad universities.  Some are international some come from Ivy Leagues some come from places Ive never heard of.  I think the name of your school is going to matter far less in your application than things like your gradesstatement of purposeresearch goalsGRE scoresetc. Ill get to the GRE in a second but for what its worth I had I think a . or a . one of those I think from undergrad and went to a small liberal arts school thats very well known and respected in its region but not necessarily as much in Virginia.  I am however an excellent writer and had excellent letters of recommendation and did well on the GRE etc. etc. etc. so its all a matter of the whole picture that your application paints of you as a scholar not just what the name of your college is or how many tenths of a point your GPA had.Getting back to the GRElike uleftcurlybracket said its literally the SAT for grad school. Presumably for Classics your writing and reading skills are already going to be good but depending on your math abilities you may want to get a GRE prep book and review things like trig that you wont have had since junior year of high school I did and it was massively helpfulbut then again I dont know how much my humanities program cared about my math score or how much Classics would care about yours.  In any event itll be the last standardized test you ever take so worth trying to do well just for prides sake.Realizing that I responded to questions  and  but not  Ill say that I couldnt speak to that not having applied to the Classics program but I know many people in my program who applied right out of undergrad and got in just fine.  Honestly I think so long as you have the general aptitude for the skills required by your field whats important applying out of undergrad as opposed to after a masters program is to have something useful to say in your SoP about why you want to do a PhD at all and why you want to explore whatever field it is you want to explore.  Your field of interest canand likely willchange either slightly or drastically but its important to demonstrate at the outset that you have a passion for something thats worthy of research.  What draws you to Classics?  Why a PhD and not just a Masters?  Why UVaare there certain professors you want to work with and why?  What can this department offer you that other departments cant?  Its good that youre thinking about this now because it gives you the ability to sort of constantly have these thoughts in the back of your mind so that you can jot down ideas as they come to you and be more prepared when it comes time to write your SoP.  The best advice ever given to me when trying to figure out my field of research was to whenever I was in class write down questions that interested me regardless of how all over the place they seemed and then to look back after a couple years and look for the common thread because trust me there will be one whether its historical or linguistic or whatever.  That will give you more of an idea of where youll be headed with your research.As for  Im a conservative shh! and what I can say is that for the most part people in my department arent dicks.  Ill temper that by saying that Im generally not a person who likes to engage in political discussions so probably dont interject where a lot of other more vocal rightofcenter people might but I can say that in class I dont generally feel like my professors are shitting all over my viewpoints or anything mine are more or less all pretty reasonable.  Colleagues read classmates and friends will from time to time but if the circlejerking gets too bad Ill usually say something and roll my eyes a little and people will shut up.
