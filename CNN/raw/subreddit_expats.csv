759988,0,t1_cgqlg7i,I am aware that expats come in different sexes and genders. My title specifies the demographic that I am referring totargeting and I am sure reddit has expats with wives who are not the ones sponsored by their company or the ones stationed where they are living. If reddit has a diverse demographic good. There will be responses reflecting that diversity. ,expats,cgqo0tv,1,t5_2rhwp
1025849,0,t1_chkvtup,gtThat said kids are extremely adaptive and fast to learn compared to any other age in their life. Theres a good chance they might hate it at the time but itll be a good experience for them later in life.Absolutely. The ability of children to learn language is staggering. The cultural differences are more difficult to meld.But all in all kids are kids and they do adapt quickly especially if there is moral support in the home when they are feeling outsiderish and they are allowed to explore the nooks and crannies of the new culture without interference.It takes a bit of time. I would guess at age  a child would make a friend or two within the first couple of months and feel at home in the new culturelanguage in about a year. Within  years that child will be all but native.At first though do expect some tantrums refusals to go back to school tears and fears. The first few months will be difficult until some fledgling friendships are formed and after that things will smooth out quite a bit.He can do it and you can be the support system that gets him through the early heebie jeebies.,expats,chkw8w6,1,t5_2rhwp

2152101,0,t1_clataa6,Thank you for your reply  I am not sure that we have the same outlook on this situation as I feel that toys usually can transcend cultures and that we should be encouraging this in our young ones. One day they will be the ones running this world and I believe giving them the most opportunities to interact with another culture even just through their toys will help them become more accepting of other people. I think that we tend to underestimate what our children will find interesting and the aspects of another culture that they are accepting of.. especially the aspects that adults have difficult times with.I am glad that you dont intentionally genderfy the gifts  I can see where this subscription would be good for some people but I just dont think I am one of them. I enjoy shopping for presents that I know they will love and cherish.Good luck though!,expats,clddpx8,3,t5_2rhwp
2256463,0,t3_2kv0wj,The number of prongs or prong design is irrelevant all that matters is the voltage you can cut off your US prongs and put on Asian ones if you are a permanent expat there and dont want to muck about with adapters...but all electronics require a transformer no matter where you are so there is no harm in the extra heat it is just a product of the higher voltage.Just dont plug in things like a US hairdryer blender etc. anything without a transformer will burn out.,expats,clqmc7m,1,t5_2rhwp

2799884,0,t3_2s1xqp,Interesting question. I have lived in Rotterdam for almost  years. I feel partially like a Rotterdammer because I know the city well and have lived it. I dont feel the slightest bit Dutch. I do speak a little bit of Dutch and do lots of daily activities in Dutch but it was maybe after  years here that I kind of realized that Id probably never be fully accepted here. I dont mean to imply that I didnt feel welcome here in anyway. But there is a difference between trying to live here in an integrated way and being accepted as a localnative.Im actually kind of happy about all that actually because it makes for a more interesting learning experience.,expats,cnmc48w,2,t5_2rhwp

3709466,0,t3_32uel3,English teacher in Korea here. Most of the expats I know here are teachers however my girlfriend works at web application start up and I also have other friends working in copywriting and editing. There are plenty of people here working as engineers consultants and other sorts of specialized positions simply because no one else is qualified. Plenty of US based companies have branches in Asia and they send over and employ a lot of westerners. I often meet people working at in different capacities at Samsung.Most jobs outside of teaching English over here are about who you know and what connections you have. I guess its pretty similar to a lot of jobs back west. Unfortunately I dont have any information beyond that. When I visited Tokyo it seemed like it was sort of the same deal. Although I met one guy working in real estate who seemed to be doing pretty well for himself.  ,expats,cqf3s15,1,t5_2rhwp

3938603,0,t3_35hi72,IANALWow you are fucked. Three years? Shes probably already in the system. Youre an idiot if you dont surrender it. She will not only lose her green card but they will bar her from reentry. Once youve been approved its easy to get one back but if youve forfeited it good luck.You need to go the embassy right now and surrender it. You need to get them to stamp her passport after showing them the I. Call the local consulateembassy TOMORROW Make an appointment to surrender her green card Guard the I like your life depends on it When she returns have the I tucked into the passport If she isnt sent to immigration for secondary ask for a referral to immigration Present the I and tell them to update her record to show that it has been surrendered Always carry the I with you until she applies againWhether or not the first guy flagged her in the system or not she is going to show as a valid green card holder. Even the frontline CBP officers working primary are going to see that on their screen and the last date of entry. Being that they can do math they will see shes in violation and you are screwed. She will not only be turned around they will probably arrest her and then release her back on a flight on your dime which can cost a few thousand dollars. You say the money matters? This isnt a land border where you just drive back. They will hold her in immigration detention until they can find a full fare flight for her.The instructions for the green card arent hard to follow. You didnt follow them. The full force of the law is going to come down on you and she wont be coming back for a long time if ever. Whats worst of all is that you could have applied for a oneyear suspension of it for  and then renewed it one more time for a maximum of  years before deciding what to do.You cant just not talk to anyone about this until the last minute. Even waiting  years is going to look bad if you try to get it back because youve proven that you cannot follow the requirements of having it. For the most part once youve been approved its easy to get back provided you havent done anything to disqualify you  well you have. God. Get this straightened out right now.,expats,cr58gs7,4,t5_2rhwp

4081073,0,t3_37bxgk,Just make sure you keep all of your marriage documentation which Im sure youre doing anyway.Generally countries dont care to deal with recognizing marriages until youre living there and the only immediate benefit is being able to live with your spouse in their home country.  If you have no plans to move to the US then there isnt anything to do.  For the US in particular it really doesnt make sense to start establishing things like green cards if you arent moving because then your spouse needs to start filing US taxes on their foreign income.  In fact you should both get up to speed on the issues surrounding marriage to an American.,expats,crlguxi,4,t5_2rhwp

Im not sure how they plan to get you a work visa Z visa and a Foreign Expert work permit without one of those.  Ask about the type of visa that theyll sponsor.I would ask to speak with some of their current or past foreign teachers over the phone.  If they cant get you a phone number for one of their teachers even a voicevideo skype session I would consider walking away.,expats,ct1x5eb,2,t5_2rhwp
4931591,0,t1_cug5lfm,You got me haha yes that was the only thing but I expected that. I did not expect the cheapness of everything though. Especially public transport for students is free inside the city you study and only  euros for me to go anywhere in the country. If I get a student card to Antwerp or Oostende set as my Home I can go anywhere between here and their for  euros. It is pretty awesome. My car gets twice the mileage as at home though so I spend the same on gas almost. Soon it will be fitted with LPG which you cant really do in NJ so the cost of fuel for me will be waaaay cheaper than back home.,expats,cug5zev,2,t5_2rhwp
