5813986,0,t3_3urfjc,I dont know about specific job opportunities but if ag is your thing then this is the one of the best places in California for it. As for adventures and things happening you wont be that much better off than in nowhereville. Big concerts occasionally come through Fresno  which is an hour away. Also  expect hot  dry weather. ,visalia,cxhs23v,1,t5_2r3rp
