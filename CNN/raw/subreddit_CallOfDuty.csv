40533,0,t1_ceinowf,Type  had some of the worst damage in its category. Swat got beat out by MA every single time. MP can win only because of its ammo capacity. Chicom is a joke. Its the worst gun in the entire game. LSAT is only used by people who sit back with target finder and serve no purpose on the team. Just because youve won a match doesnt mean you and your gun is the reason. We arent talking TDM here were talking objective game modes.

68318,0,t3_1uvrvw,All I know is Im NOT preordering anymore from IW. Yea took me a while to stop doing this but Ghosts is a mess on PC. I shouldve known better after being unhappy with MW as well thanks to this weird lag comp version that they implemented also present in Ghosts according to my experience.Treyarch on the other hand hasnt caused many disappointments. Yes I realise BO on PC had major performance issues at the start for duo core setups but they did put in the effort to solve most of them. And thats something that IW can learn from as their support and communication is incredibly bad since the past  releases.Edit Im also hoping on other titles e.g. Titanfall grabbing a good chunk of the FPS market so that companies like IW get put under pressure again. Competition is healthy.,CallOfDuty,cem7h85,2,t5_2rcq2

730122,0,t1_cgn4kx1,Its very different and I think that was its downfall. They tried to deal with some of the things that people bitched about in BO and MW but they overshot it and there was backlash. Examples   Small predictable maps  Loads of people complained that maps in BO and MW were too small and too much the same layout with three lanes. Ghosts went way to the other end of the spectrum with large unpredictable maps and people hated that too.   Guns not powerful enough  People complained that the guns in previous games didnt feel powerful enough. Ive seen them called AirSoft guns marshmallow guns etc. Ghosts made the guns way more powerful than in previous games and people didnt like it. Personally I love the changes.   Killstreaks overpowered  Now in Ghosts theyre underpowered and people dont like it. I agree that killstreaks just arent as good in this game but this is something that I personally enjoy. I no longer feel the need to carry around a launcher at all times and I enjoy that Ghosts is now a more gun vs gun focused game.  Now that IW has gone on the opposite end of the spectrum from BO and MW hopefully the next iteration will find somewhere in the middle. I guess we will see.,CallOfDuty,cgn9oom,8,t5_2rcq2

You mentioned Xbox so I imagine thats your primary platform for CoD but if you also happen to play on PC the modding community is pretty active and its not too hard to find a game. Doesnt hurt that the games multiplayer is still really fun. MW is a ghost town by comparison but the community might be stronger on consoles since they seemed to be the primary focus for the game at that point.,CallOfDuty,cgo74ls,1,t5_2rcq2

Having a multifaceted campaign that makes the player think about the true meaning of warfare and what it meant to live in the shoes of a naive warrior who wants to protect and serve their country and show the horrors they endure would be a very big change of pace for the franchise. If they incorporated a scene like the Christmas truce of  and then have them go right back to the trench warfare they were enduring would be devastatingly shocking for the player and throughly enjoyable as well.

It would also be cool to see the game touch on some of the occult fascinations of some members of the Third Reich.

On their screen Im just starting my boost dodge when Im already behind cover. If I double jump in the air on their screen I seem to be going half the speed but on mine its like they just perfectly tracked me nearteleporting into the air.The falling in the game or basically the landing after you do any exo movement feels off. Its like once youre in the air low gravity is turned on. Or its just that there is practically no air control. So it feels like youre a leapfrogging tank and it just feels awkward and not as fluid as it was meant to be.,CallOfDuty,cqo04dn,1,t5_2rcq2

The plot so far is a tad boringconfusing.As far as it feeling like same old last gen CoD the enemies still have perfect aim and only ever target you.

A lot of it is map awareness controller sensitivity and your actual ability to play fps on a controller. Try changing your sensitivity I find  to be a great realistic level to do well . Use defensive perks to give yourself a chance to stay alive like anti uav and stuff. Change how you play if your aim isnt good enough after a couple years of play I would change how I attack the game. Practice staying alive and incorporate your experience getting kills into that. If you arent a high scorer dont feed your enemy points. ,CallOfDuty,cxwtgyr,2,t5_2rcq2

6188379,0,t3_40anea,For me it wasMap design I understand a big complaint was constantly having  lane maps. I did not at all enjoy the get shot from absolutely anywhere map design ghosts went with.Progression They tried to change it up from the level to x level prestige repeat and the get to x level unlock x item. Instead they went with having individual operators that you have to level up and being able to unlock what you want pretty much whenever you want. Point streaks I actually prefer the point streak system over the kill streak or score streak systems but most of the streaks in ghosts were worthless.  Map specific streaks were cool though Also in my opinion taking almost everything out of the air and having a ridiculous system for uavs was a mistake. You shouldnt have to rely on the rest of your team to get a functional uav.With all of those mistakes I am still looking forward to ghosts . I believe they are kind of the last hope on getting a call of duty without jet packs andor laser gun andor super heroes with abilities that dont really make sense and take all of the fun out of gun fights.,CallOfDuty,cyt1y14,2,t5_2rcq2

Seriously its my favourite sight in the game just because it looks nice Railguns Ammo and grenade count holographically placed over your gun have zero clue on how to describe this but you get the idea if you played the campaignMost of the stuff especially the guns in Black Ops  just feel...notsosophisticated and that kinda makes me depressed.

7688328,0,t3_4kmli5,InballthepoststalkingabouthowshittyBOcampaignisAnyway heres my two cents on recent COD campaigns. Take it or leave it your choice. Ghosts I despise Ghosts so much even to this day. The story is incredibly shallow more so than BO ever will be Ill get into that in a few moments. Theres no real interaction between you and the rest of the world especially the two NPCs that are your brother and father. You basically dont exist other than when they tell you to do an objective. And the villain makes no sense either because he doesnt have a true motive other than being a brainwashed agent who got grumpy about his teammates having to drop him behind in their last mission together. Level design in Ghosts is also pretty linear and not that memorable to me tbh.. AW AW is slightly better than Ghosts in that there is some psychological value within its storytelling. It does fall short at certain parts because once again silent protagonist ruins everything they did have him speak in cutscenes but its not much given the actors potential and popularity. There is some openness to AWs level design but again nothing that screams innovative. There is a stealth level though that basically gives you a lot of freedom either by passing through the entire area with zero kills or a lot of hidden bodies. That is one level I am impressed with. Overall slightly better than Ghosts but probably on the same level if not worse than BO.. BO Now this is where things get interesting. Ive been defending BO campaign since day one when so many people tore it apart for various reasons. Its hard to tell you why BO is great without spoiling it but Ill give it a try. The main problem most people have with BO including myself to a certain extent is that the real plot of the game is not shown to you explicitly but youre given a modified version of it instead. The basic nature of the story may seem like your typical AI gone rogue story but its much much deeper than that. Its more about AI letting you experience someone elses memories to make you think youre not dead. Its a very complex plot but it also harmed itself due to a lack of proper explanation of the events. As far as level designs are concerned BO is both better and worse than Ghosts and AW. It has some of the most nonlinear designs Ive ever seen plus player abilities allow you to take various different approach to taking out enemies in a large battlefield. However it also encourages coop play more than solo play which can be frustrating especially on the hardest difficulty. Tldr BO gt AW gt Ghosts.,CallOfDuty,d3g44jh,4,t5_2rcq2

This is why Activision has put money towards Cod Comp cause it exposes new viewers and offers more variety  I have played CoD Comp for a good  years now before that i  played  maybe  hours on a Saturday as soon as i found cod comp was a thing i was playing  hours a day i was keen to come home and get on.

Also heres a tip of you put an acog on any of the guns it dramatically reduce the recoil. The perks youll have to play around with them to see what fits you when it first came out I was using sixth scents and fast hands and blast suppressor. The mk I think thats what its called takes a little to get used to but its pretty good frags and stuns are the same. Now specialists they are all good to an extent.

7979945,0,t1_d4ctjm1,Oh believe me my first COD was COD so that and MW had set my standard for FPS originally it was GoldenEye. But that isnt to say that I havent enjoyed some of the COD games since then. BO is the most fun Ive had in a COD since MW and its futuristic. Sure it has CODPoints and Supply Drops but I feel like thats more a product of gaming now in general than just Call of Duty. To me Call of Duty was always a first person shooter before a modern first person shooter which I guess is why I dont mind the futuristic setting as much as others do. Would I love a return to modern games? Sure but I also have faith in Infinity Ward to deliver a solid game. We may never return to the quality of the MW series but people need to remember that those games were improbably awesome and not easily repeatable. ,CallOfDuty,d4d0r9x,1,t5_2rcq2

Ghosts was great one of my favorites in the series.  Theyve always had the superior network  infrastructure by far and another strong point for them is maps. I thought they did an excellent job with ghosts maps mws maps were decent for the most part and mws maps were the best in the series IMO.

8200616,0,t1_d52dh91,A few years ago there was a push to get consumers into D movies and games at home.

It honestly doesnt matter if everyone is backing it if they cant market it to average consumers. Right now there is very little to entice the average consumer especially at the current prices. Hey you want to feel like youre in the ocean and a big ass whale swims right in front of you? Yeah! Sweet youll need this several hundred dollar headset and a several hundred  dollar rig decent amount of space etc. You know who bought into VR? People like me who spend poorly and love technology or people who have money to burn. Its not cheap and what youre getting for that money is currently not much. Its a bunch of hastily made shovelware to cash in on the novelty of VR. Im sure fantastic things are coming in the future for VR but by the time that happens were going to need newer and better equipment. Buying into VR right now was a total loss. If they want it to catch on they have to sell it to normal people and to do that theyre going to need to have much more impressive software and theyre going to need to find a way to bring the price down significantly. ,CallOfDuty,d52mpt6,1,t5_2rcq2

The problem is in a game like Call of Duty its not possible to do consistently well with a playstyle like this especially if you add in the nerfs youre talking about. The only game where proper traditional sniping is possibleviable to do is Ghosts but even then quickscoping is sometimes necessary I think at this point everyone should just accept that quickscoping is a core and necessary part of COD and it should be possible to do in each game but of course shouldnt be too easy either  COD  and Ghosts being great examples of this IMO.,CallOfDuty,d6mv84y,1,t5_2rcq2

They wont stop doing advanced movement unless a game flops horribly which didnt happen with BO and I doubt it will happen with IW.

9025158,0,t3_53rhxx,I think the game should have map based killstreaks. For example in certain maps calling in a care package gives you a slim chance of acquiring a special killstreak like in ghosts and advanced warfare. On an urban map like Saigon for example you can call in a squad of tanks that roll through the map using their cannon to destroy any targets. The team that called them in could also jump into them and use the mounted machine guns. Infantry maps like hamburger Hill could literally have an infantry killstreak that calls in a massive wave of AI controlled soldiers.,CallOfDuty,d7woks5,1,t5_2rcq2

9427575,0,t3_59q84p,COD doesnt know what it wants to be because we the players dont know what we want it to be.From the beginning of COD I remember one of the biggest criticisms for the game was that every COD is the same which drove COD away from WW and WW into modern warfare and from modern into futuristic. Yet now we the players argue quite the contrary saying we want COD to be just like COD  or MW or for it to go back to WW. Its hypocritical and down right confusing for the developers. In their defense going further into the future was their only safe option being that a realisticfuturistic fast passed nonarcade style FPS had never been done. By treading into uncharted territory they play their hand by giving the players something new that they might like. COD back in the day became so popular in part for its fast paced action which is why they went to the advanced movement smaller maps and low timetokill. Not to mention they are clearly doing the supply drops not simply because it makes money but because everyone else is doing it AND IT WORKS. SO I really dont understand people like you and a lot of this community who are confused by the direction of the COD series because everything that they have done is for a VERY clear reason. And weather or not you LIKE the direction is different but not SO different. If you wonder why they continue in this direction despite the overall dislike for the direction its again the fault of us the players as we SAY we hate it but continue to buy and play the games.Downvote it you want but whether or not its true it is logical and it is clear.,CallOfDuty,d9b0dfh,10,t5_2rcq2

10696613,0,t1_ddj6phs,I there when they announced it and yes there was a lot of positivity about it and everyone was excited. I was also there for the next reveal and it was not as positive. It was generally the same thought as me yes its free DLC but theres a lack of effort by only bringing in old maps instead of putting in new ones. As for campaigns you could give me a fps with zero campaign and Im fine I really dont play them unless Im not online or servers are down. I started IWs and havent even touched TFs. And yes EA are dickheads for stucking TF between BF and COD. That was unbelievably stupid. It shouldve been released right around this time or the beginning of Q to really pop its sales. And I also want to address devs listening to say devs dont listen in COD or dont listen well isnt really the truth. Take a look at Raven before the game they changed a ton based on feedback and they just released an update where they addressed  or  major fucking issues brought up by the community. IWD has been on the IW sub a lot since January and their first DLC pack consisted of maps that the community asked for after release a night map a map with some weather and larger maps. We got that in dominion neon and noir. And I dont think I have to say anything about arc since they have the best community manager of all the devs. The people that dont listen are the greedy publishers of Activision. As for COD sales diminishing theyve been steadily going down since MW smashed records up until BO which was the best selling one since MW. So no shit IW was gonna take a hit. Add in the frustration of some players and the fact that it had competition in the fps market and it was undoubtably going to look bad. Regardless of if its AW or BOTG next year theres a good chance sales see a bump simply because there is no other top shooter scheduled to be released around that time right now. Id say that it goes up not to the level of BO but thats just my guess. And I also dont know how halo is doing mDLC and dont know how much they make off of it. So I will continue to refrain from commenting so I dont make myself look like a complete moron on that subject lol. ,CallOfDuty,ddj9y3a,1,t5_2rcq2

I dont remember any spots on Ghosts and dont remember half of the callouts. CoD on the other hand have non symmetrical maps with great design and planning in them.I see Overgrown I think top of grandmas house barn broken I see Bog I think containers wall store bus I see Showdown I think stairs catwalk gate as all viable spots for me to look out for or go towards.I see Sovereign I think okay I dont know what map that is. Tremor I think bus that everyone camps in so itll be impossible for me to get in there. I see Warhawk I think Standoff ripoff.Just overall the maps are not memorable not fun and just boring as shit. Im sorry but if anything in the most recent cods Bo Ghost AW IW I just think the vanilla maps are absolute fucking garbage.

In my experience the other cod games only allow you to play search and tdm. Cod also is a PC game which the newer cods are definitely not.

11388934,0,t3_62g9kt,. Call of Duty  The best campaign so far. For me at least its the most realistic campaign set in modern of future times. So many classic missions like All Ghillied Up classic villains and classic heroes. It definitely set a high bar.. Modern Warfare  While losing the realism of Call of Duty s plot it definitely increases the emotional impact. Shepherds betrayal is  in my favorite campaign moments. The deaths of Roach and Ghost retaking the White House chasing Shepherd downriver...what a great campaign . Black Ops  stands out because it introduced customization into the campaign. Multiple paths multiple endings a lot of replayability. Menendez is also a fantastic villain and is my  villain.The rest of rankings for the games Ive played go Black Ops  World at War Advanced Warfare Ghosts Modern Warfare  Black Ops .,CallOfDuty,dfmx0qe,8,t5_2rcq2

Dont get me wrong I want dedicated servers as much as you and any other CoD fan which Im hopping this year they do. I just think around the MW and BO days things started getting repetitive. Small three lane maps where SMGs dominated on every aspect the same kill streaks with different skins etc. Even though those werent bad games they eventually got boring and repetitive in my opinion. So I think if they could make an exciting new change without the use of jet packs and keeping to the core CoD feel it would be a great game. I would love to see dedicated servers too I think thats almost a must for multiplayer games these days. ,CallOfDuty,dfz8y8f,1,t5_2rcq2

Lets be fucking real now CoD sucked shit WW had the best campaign of any CoD but couldnt compete with CoD BO was not as good as MW and BO is where people actually saw Treyarch as a good company.Once Stealth Clown left IW THATS when Treyarch finally took the reigns. CoDMW are the best games of the franchise and Treyarch finally perfected their craft with BO.As a side note I dont like BO that much. I love Treyarch for Zombies and the WWBO campaigns not multiplayer. Im just dick riding BO because everyone does plus it was the last actually good CoD excluding MWR. But my point is that Treyarch have NEVER been the best company. Just cause they saved Activisions asses after the failure of MW which was seen as too samey by a lot of fans including myself doesnt mean theyre the best.

Marathon Pro  Rushing with Unlimited SprintScavenger Pro  Camping the way it is.Sleight of Hand Pro Quick ADS for Sniping ClassesBling mehOMA and here is the problem Keep OMA the way it is but if a class has Noob Tube ban it. Period. Great  Campaign one of the best . MW . BO . IWSpec. Ops The definition of a real rd Mode now bring that with  Survival like MW and you have a perfect game.As for a Remaster version of this game. Thank you but no thank you.
