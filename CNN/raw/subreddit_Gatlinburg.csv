6653951,0,t1_d06x6a6,Of course!  We went to the Aquarium and it was definitely worth it especially if you have a family.  If youre in to mini golf you wont be disappointed. There is tons around.  Another great thing was the Ripleys Odditorium.  A lot of really cool and odd things in their and well worth the money.  We went up to Ober Gatlinburg there is an awesome Alpine slide and Coaster.  We also went ice skating up there.  Another big thing we did was fourwheeling and zip lining at Jayell Ranch.  It seemed sketchy at first but it was pretty fun for a good price!  There is also go karting in quite a few places.  There is so much to do you cant get to it all but thats some of the stuff we did.  Id also suggest walking down the main street and visiting all the little stores. There is a lot of great things.  I hope you enjoy your trip and make memories!  Feel free to comment back and let me know how it goes!,Gatlinburg,d07kr3h,1,t5_2taz5
8325089,0,t3_4th8ak,I loved the Smoky Mountain Brewery. Its in Gatlinburg and they are kind of like a tavernsports bar environment. Casual and laid back. When we were there last it was fall and we were watching football on the TVs. Atrium Pancakes is pretty iconic. They do serve lunch. The Fox amp Parrot is an English pub style restaurant. I have that on my list to visit next time I go. Its not exactly in Gatlinburg though...its east..about a quarter of the way to Cosby.,Gatlinburg,d5i6w0e,2,t5_2taz5

9819329,0,t3_5fuer2,Thanks for posting this. We have a cabin rental for this weekend and the rental co is telling us everything is fine. Meanwhile theyre still evacuated and the fire is only  contained. Hmmm...edit Finally got through to the cabin company. Great customer service. What a relief.,Gatlinburg,danh6pe,3,t5_2taz5

9855262,0,t3_5gfcb6,But who climbs the chimney tops in jeans and tennis shoes. They happen to be there the day it started and are clearly leaving the area in the video. Maybe just a coincidence but seems hardly.,Gatlinburg,das5wcm,4,t5_2taz5

9871739,0,t1_dau9y0l,I havent had a bad experience with them over many years of renting from them.  Call them!  they have lots of cabins that are decorated for the holidays. My partner and I were there just the week before the fires. This time around we took our dogs three of them! I was blown away at the cleanliness of the their pet friendly cabins  for a fairly central location look around mountain shadows resort. Its near glades road. The first entrance to the resort is a bit hilly. Doable but hilly. The second entrance is a breeze to drive.  Good luck in your search and have a wonderful trip! Ill be heading back very soon! My happy place! ,Gatlinburg,daub7l5,1,t5_2taz5

10394177,0,t3_5hzh87,Hey! Im planning a trip to the area and was wondering if the recent fire had affected your trip in any way? I know it wasnt going on while you were there but was anything closed was anything you wanted to see inaccessible etc.? Thank you!,Gatlinburg,dcm8vre,1,t5_2taz5
10638244,0,t1_ddb2eff,gt Wilderness at the SmokiesI check Reddit about once a week  I really like how they also have non waterbased activities like their ropes course laser tag rock climbing area mini golf bowling and playground and its all inclusive if you get the all dayall stay adventure pass. A lot more bang for your buck and you dont have to go anywhere.,Gatlinburg,ddd94pd,1,t5_2taz5
