10405,0,t3_1u8l6j,As everyone else has agreed. Fire. And hopefully at least  ways to start one. Try to avoid ever picking wood up directly off the ground but especially so after rain. Second tip to I would give from cold winter camping is tarps and lots of them. Use paracord to tie them down. Bring at least a hundred feet or more so you have extra if you need it. Try and position your tarps to create a leanto that acts as a wind break and shelter for the tent and the area directly around the fire. This helps keep you dry while you warm up. A fire is a miracle but its effectiveness is cut in half if you are getting warm on your front and soaked on your back.If your crossing streams and rivers everything in your bag goes into zip locks. Period. A misstep in a stream that leads to your bag and supplies getting completely submerged and soaked could be a death sentence in winter weather.Edit Also good heavy ponchos are also always a good idea to keep with you. Again you need to stay dry getting unnecessarily wet could cost you.,Survival,cefmb92,2,t5_2qh7j
12387,0,t1_cefth0u,If you dont think fire is important in wet conditions them your the twit. Second you know  ways to start a fire. Good for you? Do you want a cookie or something? Anyone who knows what they are talking about will agree that redundant forms of fire starting are critical. Especially in wet conditions.Third tarp keeps you dry and breaks the wind. This keeps you dry and warm. Which is once again is critical in wet conditions.Fourth Paracord is only one type of rope and? Its strong light and doesnt take up a lot of space in a pack. Critical when backpacking. Fifth tell me again where said that you should light the fire under the tarp? I said place the tarps AROUND not over.Lastly if you have something better than zip locks thats great and sure they may not be the most reliable. But I honestly have never once had a problem with them.Edit And since you asked yes I am experienced. I grew up in Utah and have spent most of every summer and many a winter in the Uintas. Let alone all over the western United States and Canada. Ive been using a leanto reflector wall combo for years. It has always kept me dry and warm on many a cold night.,Survival,cefuf5a,2,t5_2qh7j

184629,0,t1_cey6s6h,.This one is the biggest thing I see every time someone gets lost. Bush Panic. It may start as you thinking you can find your way out or it may start as you realizing youre lost and running in hopes youll find a miracle. This is the worst thing you can do because aside from getting lost youre liable to waste precious energy encounter numerous dangers like falls or pits or anything youre not prepared for. Second to that is not taking care of yourself first. If people get lost in pairs there will often be one person who focuses on keeping the other one alive at the expense of themself. Thats bad because if they need you to keep them alive youre useless to them dead. I dont think that needs more explanationGetting lost here is split pretty evenly between not preparing for the weather and getting caught in heavy fog or bad weather going out without knowledge of the trail youre walking ending up lost or going out unprepared for an injury tripping up and not being able to help yourself. We have the scattered drunken wanderer or emotionally distressed just looking to get away for a while not thinking how to get back but theyre not as common as top three.The most common thing I see that gets people in trouble is it wont happen to me. Statistically probably not but if youre unprepared and it does youre shagged. If youre ready for something if it does happen youll be very glad. I always carry my gobag when I go in the woods be it on a search or for a hike. Its about  pounds and it has everything I need to survive for a couple days in the woods maybe longer. Havent had to use it off call but if I need it I know I will NEED it. Wilderness survival training I think is a must if youre going even for a little hike. I dont know the official stats if they exist but Id wager that youve got a  better chance to make it with survival training than without. If youre going out and cant find a course or maybe cant afford one go to your local SAR teams website and find someone to contact. Almost every team does training courses on it often for free of charge and if not there will be someone on the team more than happy to give you the basics on what to do and what not to do. Its no replacement for actual training but its better than going into the woods bare. RE animals here the only thing in the woods that even really has the capability to kill you is a pissed off moose but often times the loud sounds lights sirens and helicopters scare them far from the scene. Believe it or not ours is probably mud. It rains so much here and in the middle of the night what might look like soft ground could be a sinkhole youll be neck deep in three seconds.

396560,0,t3_1yja77,Basically salt is dissolved into the sea water meaning you dont have big grains of it floating around in it. Getting it out with a simple filter is unfortunately not possible. What you need to do is to distil it by heating it up to create moisture and then cooling it down to make it into drinkable water.Mother nature does this on a grand scale on our waters every day. This then comes down as drinkable water in the form of rains. Solar stills use this basic principle.Frozen sea ice can in many cases be molten and the water is drinkable. When the water freezes slowly the salt gets separated from the water. However if it freezes quickly ions can be trapped in small pockets of the ice. Next time you are on ocean ice if you have the chance of it chip away a piece and let it melt in your mouth it doesnt taste salt at all. And this is also an easy way to test it. You do taste the salt if there is salt in it. So you can melt seawater and just have a taste and spit it out if it tastes salt.Around where I live the sea freezes during winter and Ive tried this out of curiosity many times. Ive noticed that right after the sea freezes it sometimes is salty. But if it is older ice it isnt. From what Ive read this is common and that newly frozen sea ice has some salt in it and that the small amounts of salts gradually filter through the frozen water. So I guess older sea ice  better water source.,Survival,cflvb6j,1,t5_2qh7j

I also took a semester long first responder course that was intended as one part of an EMT curriculum but again that was about  years ago. Ive also helped a couple of friends study for their emt and paramedic certs reading flash card and the like so maybe there is some medical information osmosis there too.I rarely carry much of a first aid kit and usually its just composed of a couple of minor things like aspirin for altitude or something to dry up the pipes when heading south of the border. When available again unusually south of the border Ill toss in some broad spectrum antibiotics just in case.Its always seemed to me that when you move beyond a few bandaids and get into the equipment that will actually make a real difference in a catastrophe your first aid kit quickly becomes so cumbersome that you might as well invite a paramedic along to carry it. Luckily quite a few of my friends are paramedics and firefighters but most of them dont carry much of a first aid kit either.If Im heading out with other people the first thing I toss in are gloves and a cpr mask but honestly thats for my benefit not theirs.I guess Id say my first aid kit is primarily composed of knowledge and an exit strategy.

792611,0,t1_cguc3b3,The most simpleuseful knot in my opinion is the Palomar Knot It is a simple yet very strong knot and anyone can do it with minimal instruction. The picture I linked is very easy to follow. It is also good for use with both braided and monofilament lines. It can also work with most kinds of lures and hooks.If you are using a bobber they are fairly simple to add. You depress one end of the bobber It will look like a button or plunger to show the line hook insert the line and release making sure it slots back in the hole. Then it gets a little harder. You need to depress the plunger around the top line hook while making sure the bottom one does not move and insert the line there and release.You generally want a split shot sinker. It is attached simply by pinching it shut around the line. Unless you are strong finger tight will not do so you need pliers or something to squish it between. Not to hard though or you could weaken the line. Just enough so it is very solid.Places to fish is a much more complicated question. Not every body of water has fish and not everywhere that does have fish will have them spread out evenly. Fish tend to congregate in places for shade cover specific currents and a host of other reasons and swim in schools when they do travel.Places to look for when fishing.... Submerged Stuff  Logs trees rocks even manmade items like cars sunken boats or tires all attract fish. Bank Features  Rip Rap manmade rocks piled on banks reeds trees docks walls or anything that sort of differentiate one section of the coastline from the next. Coastal Featuresfor mainly larger bodies of water  Points points of land coming out draws reverse points of land these are where water points into the land bars ridges of land under the water that change the water flow merging waterways a stream coming into a larger body and anywhere where it is different fish congregate. None of the Above  Yup Sometimes fish just hangout somewhere for no apparent reason. You may find something after research like an underground spring a current change or the guy down the road has been feeding the fish to lure them there. Sometimes the just appear.But finding fish can be hard and there are dozens of things you could look for I did not even mention. In general though once you find a good spot for fish it will be a good spot until something changes time of day weather or seasons. I have been fishing several hundred times and I can tell you that it is always a gamble with a new body of water.

Similar but different.If you look at a cross section of the head you will see why its different than a knife. The thin bit of the axe serves to move it parallel to the grain and the wide cheeks and heavy poll combine with the chopping action to push the wood perpendicular to the grain splitting it outward. A knife lacks all of those except for the narrow blade  so when you baton you are just moving downward through the grain without the perpendicular force. Because of this youre fighting friction the whole way down so a wider blade tends to get stuck more often.This isnt to say that those beastly BKs and other thick blades are bad in any way its just a common complaint that I hear and one thats uncommon on thinner blade knives.,Survival,cguw2ll,1,t5_2qh7j

1823704,0,t3_2ff9s2,Im an adventure racer and regularly race on foot bike and boat for days at a time without sleep.  I dont normally consider that survival per se since I pay to do it and leave my house with the intent of putting myself in that situation.  A couple of years ago on a four day race shit hit the fan and I was quite sick before the race even started.  Id be damned if I was going to sit it out since I was all ready dressed for the ball though!Long story short after  hrs of racing in  deg heat and  humidity and a bushwhack up Bigelow Mtn what a nightmare! we did a bivouac at around midnight at the top on the Appalachian Trail.  Our bushwhack went perpendicular to the trail and following that wed go on the trail for about    km and then go bushwhacking down the mountain.  My illness had mostly been a sinus infection combined with some dry heaving.  I was the navigator and the bushwhack up the mountain was difficult and the bushwhack down was going to be a bit more difficult so we knew the bivouac was a good idea to rest me up so we wouldnt screw up!I woke up after only about  minutes and I was totally out of my witts.  I thought I was home in my room and I was looking for the light to turn on.  One of my teammates woke up with me and while I couldnt communicate very well nor could I see I started to come to enough to know that I was proper fucked up and there were no real options for rescue.  Frightened I went back to sleep for an additional  minutes.  When I woke I had my witts and the saving grace was that I was freezing!  That helped break the fever enough to unscramble the brain.  I force fed myself a bunch of food and some  Hour energy and we set off... it was such a delight to have to move to warm up after the first  hours in the heat!  The bivouac was the perfect decision for us I led us on the difficult bushwhack down the mountain that his a remote control that many teams missed.  We went on to have a VERY respectable finish where we were in the company of teams that we had no business placing with.  I wasnt exactly the model of health for the rest of the race though.  The fever and sinus infection seemed to have passed but heat stroke set in on Sugarloaf.  The dry heaves turned into straight up barfing.  That was frightening because hydration and calorie intake is so important but we were close enough for rescue  civilization at that point that the risk was low with respect to survival.  A midnight hike on Burnt Mountain and then to the peak of Sugarloaf cured the heatstroke and then I was more or less fine for the remaining couple of days... minus the regular effects of four days worth of racing with less than four hours sleep!That bivouac on Bigelow though... when I first woke up and sort of came to I knew immediately that if I didnt come around then shit was going to be very bad.  The answer was a bit anticlimactic  minutes sleep in the cold some chips and a  hr energy... but thats what it was.At the finish line Im the tall guy second from the right.  If anyone is interested... I can detail the final biking leg of the race was wild!  I lost all faculties almost as soon as we got on the home stretch after the final difficult navigational bit.  It was strange and hilarious!,Survival,ck8y2i6,4,t5_2qh7j

Youd be surprised with the kind of stuff that was in the original Boy Scout Handbook Aids to Scouting or Scouting for Boys. It was a real military training manual.        Also theres a lot of different kinds or scouting and outdoor learning type organizations like Outward Bound the Sierra Club has a youth group Trail Life.      I would recommend at least getting affiliated with a group because the Boy Scouts are often heavily connected and are a full spectrum organization whose influence extends beyond that of mere woodcraft.          Also on the business or nonprofit side of things you really cant beat a Title  charter. That gives the Scouts a very unique position as far youth organizations go since they are really in an anticompetitive position.

Maybe at some point the hawk design was different and allowed it to be used as a good wood craft tool but the cheap one that I ended up with from ColdSteel was designed to be thrown at dead pigs and watermelons.When trying to split a sawn piece of wood the narrow tapered bit of the hawk bites into the wood but sticks easily requiring two hands to pull it out and to try again. The same problem happens when trying to cut down a tree. I bought a GB hatchet than a BiberOxhead the difference between a combat oriented hawk and a real ax is night and day.

Make it into a nest with a divot in the center. Once you get your coal dump it into the center of the nest and close the nest gently around the coal. Dont smother it!Then start waving it briskly back and forth in front of you in a horizontal figure . Ive found this technique works much better than trying to blow on it just right. Once copious smoke starts pouring out then blow and blow hard. Sometimes actually the bundle will spontaneously ignite with just the waving no blowing.You should of course then transfer the flaming tinder bundle to the pile of very dry very thin twigs and kindling youve prepared ahead of time.,Survival,cp8vy74,1,t5_2qh7j

The largest concern with a fresh catch as you described would be things like parasites that can be transferred through undercooked meat. Old rotting carcasses can also be contaminated with bacteria which can cause illness but these are usually not present in a recently dead animal. Also as mentioned dont mess with the intestines as they can be infectious but are otherwise isolated from the parts youd want to eat.So Id say just wash the shit off your hands with water as best you can and cook everything thoroughly and you should be fine.

5088793,1,t3_3kp6q6,Relating to a situation primarily through fear makes it into a dangerous situation  for yourself and others.This doesnt mean that there is no danger out there. No place is free of risk. But your own mindset cocreates your reality. If you let fearful daydreams determine how you relate to the woods how powerful will a weapon have to be to pacify that fear? No weapon can do it because the fear didnt come from the outside you made it.So if you try to overcome something you made with your own thinking by carrying around a killing weapon... wont you be one of those crazy people in the woods? And should others then aim their weapons at you?Calm down. When you are not facetoface with something your thinking about it tends to take over. Its the same as when youre away from your girlfriendboyfriend reality starts to slip away and you live the relationship through your imagination. Going into the woods is a chance for you to get more grounded in reality. Make it an excursion that suits your level of experience. Take some day hikes do some car camping do an overnight close to home. Taper in and get some experience under your belt so that your activity can be based on reality rather than your rampant imagination.If all you have is a hammer everything starts looking like a nail.The danger of focusing on a weapon as your goto solution for threatening situations is that your mind will become narrow abandoning other pathways  some perhaps far more reasonable and beneficial and some that you couldnt even imagine until they appear creatively in the moment. It betrays an inherent lack of trust in yourself.The way you gain that selftrust and confidence is by facing fear in reasonable doses. Go into situations where you can apply what you know to get by. Learn develop skills and knowledge and then find your next appropriate challenge. Some will grow by leaps and bounds some will grow gradually and steadily and most will grow by taking many falls and getting up again. The main thing is that your actual innate confidence will be based on real experience not fantasy nor external props.Heroicbutfoolish is not a substitute for real confidence based on experience and selfknowledge. The latter takes time and effort whereas the spectacular heroic effort without any real basis is just immature. Even so a lot of guys will gain some measure of real experience because they happen to survive their immature forays.,Survival,cuze4do,2,t5_2qh7j

I liked the overall brutality of it as it seemed to show how hard frontier life was and portrayed the natives as people who should be feared whereas a good amount of other movies seem to portray the natives as dumb and incapable of fighting back.   What I really liked was the sincerity of the bear attack.

The only solid piece of advice that I think will save a life is to always carry a walking stick of at least your own height and of a solid strong wood. Use this stick to probe parts of the ground before you walk on them. Sometimes with bogs the ground can actually just be layers of roots over water with no discernible difference from solid ground.

I have a way bigger list than what Ill post here so if you have something specific in mind let me know. Im from NZ so we have a wide variety of environments to test this stuff out and Ive been doing so for a long time hunting and survivingGeneral hardy gear but I only use the scabbard from them at the momentThe pants from these guys are amazing  recommend. Get the pro versions because they have the knee joints sewn in for movement. Have to do some research to see which ones will be good for you and sizes can be an issue so measure upEberlestock bags Skycrane  is my favourite so farIf you want a little tent quick to put up Other sites will do this I dont think these guys will ship further than New Zealand I tested this for a week in the NZ bush in open and covered areas. Its amazing no bugs no moisture since its made of gortex. The only thing to be aware of if you have a down sleeping bag it wont doo too well with the first option. But down sleeping bags are not too great for survival because if they get wet its over. That might be my personal opinion but I wont take a down sleeping bag out again for that type of activityOrThese guys do some good warm stuff but Id just get a thin down layer and get a better tougher jacket. Or if you can find a merino down jacket thats better. Always go with Merino gt anything else in my experienceExpensive but amazing gear. I wouldnt bother too much with this because of the cost and you can find something similar but its nice to check out. The observer would be amazing but Im sticking with the cheaper dutch army hooped bivvy at the momentOff the ground sleeping. Sleeping sideways in a hammock is really nice but these guys do a great job of making the most of that designMy favorite knife. Knives are a personal feel but this one is invincible so far. It wont let you down. Get some fire steel too. I got a different sheath for mine and always clip on your knife when not using it. Losing is the worst. I learnt that the hard way but luckily found it on the way back  NZ is a really damp place to try and make a fire and if you really need to make one these are really goodFirst aid kits are really personal some people dont get blisters etc so get a small tough dry bag and build it up. You can find essentials lists online. Its better this way because you know exactly what you have and it will give you the skills to replenish the kit as you use pieces of it. Water filters are good but always boil it if you can. Get a steel canteen that you can put on the fire to boil if you need to.MCQ Bushcraft  This guy knows his stuff for Europe and takes a lot of time to explain why hes making his decisions. The videos are long but there is definitely something there for your desired survival topicParacord is a must. You can get it in varying sizes but this stuff is necessary unless youre going to make your own cord out there.Sleaskinz I cannot rave enough about these socks so just get them. Knee length is great but get a knee length and midAnimal fats I like taking some into the bush you can eat it if you have to but its awful. I use it to coat my knives and guns when Im out.

I have said it before and I will say it again be aware of your surroundings this does not mean merely looking out for visible danger but using resources to find clean hunting and gathering places.

Power companies bust ass to restore power as fast as possible crews work to clear roads quickly too. Id imagine a ship that signals distress and goes down has a very steep drop off of survival rate after  days as well as ocean currents can move you far from the area you went down plus supplies would be limited even on a life raftboat. In the water even in the summer hypothermia is likely to set in the first day if you cant find something to float on mostly out of the water and the sun would bake you during the day accelerating dehydration getting you to that  days without water number quickly... and I imagine rescue crewsother ships would take this into account when responding to request for assistance.Lost hikers hiking near trails would likely be found relatively quickly if at all once they were reported missing or just started panicking and blowing a signal whistlefiring  shots as a ranger or other hiker would likely hear them from a trail.

In the Kalahari desert and the Labrador episodes where he ends the week early due to safety he talks about when hes going to radio for help.  Hed be a fool to set himself up for the risk without a backup plan.,Survival,dg61ldp,24,t5_2qh7j

If were talking about redditors arguing over whether or not a stupid viral video of two teens pranking each other is staged or not it really doesnt. ,Survival,dg6isi7,1,t5_2qh7j

11586773,0,t3_659593,Ive been focusing on prevention and safety. Also altitude training and hiking. I recently moved to a higher elevation near the Rocky Mountains and have been immersed in outdoor activities. I practice the steps to prevent survival situations like always checking weather trail conditions knowing the environment and where safety is. I feel like survival prevention and safety is often over looked as we get so amped for burning wood and building shelters. Not to say those skills are to be overlooked. Just that some simple practices achieved with only your mind can do wonders in the way you approach the outdoors.  Most recently I went to the local museum and took interest in the different ecological displays. I learned of plants that stored water and exactly what they looked like. Also what animals would be ideal food sources and what they looked like in the wild. Additionally I highly recommend checking out the native peoplesfirst nations exhibit of your area as they have built their entire civilizations off the land which you can undoubtably learn from. The best thing about it is that its taken with you as knowledge weighs nothing and you take it with you everywhere. The most important items arent packed in a bag.,Survival,dg9d9c3,4,t5_2qh7j
