253178,0,t3_1x02u1,Because for some reason theyre the only rock band that gets any real acknowledgement from the mainstream media.  Foos are epic but a lot of other bands are too and they dont get nearly the same recognition as the foos.  I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that when Dave was in Nirvana they were the biggest band in the world and the media never really stopped loving him after Nirvana.  Im not saying he doesnt deserve all the attention that he gets but I would like to see the other big players in the rock world get some recognition i.e. Josh Homme Trent Reznor Jesse Hughes ect.,Foofighters,cf6zvms,5,t5_2sav4

I do hope you have a better experience at Wrigley because hey...its the fucking Foos their shows are so much fun. The GA crowd at Citi Field seemed especially rowdy and not in a good way.There were some obnoxiously pushy people at the show. My friends and I were about  rows from the front and then a group of  older folks forced their way into the crowd in front of me. A group of guys and a woman got justifiably angry and thus started a shouting match. Almost got physical...right as the show was starting. Really soured Everlong.In my act of silent rebellion I saw one of the older guys try to high five me as I was bouncing to the song...left him hanging.Then Monkey Wrench began and about  OTHER people started shoving their way to the front. Really? Deflated my hype at the beginning but I managed to enjoy the rest of the show.

To do that they need to use individual files or stems for each instrument. So the drums are on one or two files the vocals on another and so on.

8978060,0,t1_d7qyh0k,I also usually prefer their upbeat rock stuff. I think the thing is that the songs for the acoustic side of IYH were written over several years by Dave without any real concept that they were forced into. They were just collected by him in  because they were a bunch of great softer songs.The rock side on the other hand were mostly new songs specifically written to be rawk hard!! paraphrased slightly perhaps. And it just feels forced as a result of that concept and not rock hard. In my opinion there is no song on the IYH rock disc which is harder than for example Wattershed Weenie Beenie both from ST Wind Up Enough Space both TCATS or All My Life from OBO. And all those songs came from conceptless awesome plain old rock albums. I guess my point is that Dave should just write awesome songs and he shouldnt overthink things and come up with crazy concepts for his albums to keep things fresh when the freshest thing he could do is just continue writing amazing songs..,Foofighters,d7r0yfc,4,t5_2sav4
