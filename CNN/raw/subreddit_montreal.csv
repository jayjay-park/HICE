55906,0,t1_cekoayk,Pretty much every business thats big enough to be doing international business has a team of English translators who will understand you far better than you could ever hope to understand the host language simply by studying it especially since corporate jargon further complicates communication. Never mind all the little nuances that may wreak havoc on relations and diplomacy if theyre misunderstood or ignored. There is almost no point to learn any language than English for business purposes unless you can become perfectly fluent in it as well as the separate dialect that is legalspeak. The one exception may be Spanish since its speakers represent a market thats widespread and huge enough to ignore the nonSpanish speaking world most of the time. But the practical application of learning a language for business cannot be said for French since too many of its speakers are from countries that have almost no chance of political stability or economic importance in the near future despite it having some meagre presence in a few wealthy nations other than France. Seriously half of Belgium a quarter of Switzerland a third of Canada and France itself are basically the only places where one would do real business in French. Im not trying to insult you but have you considered that maybe you dont understand just how farreaching and deep Englishs practical dominance is because your own world is small and selfcontained? Because learning Japanese Korean Portuguese French Italian Russian etc for anything more than fun personal travel or fulfillment is pretty misguided. It makes it easier to order at a restaurant or appreciate literature but its practically useless for business unless youre exceptionally adept. Almost any adult who chooses to learn those languages to better his career would be wasting his time.Im not counting the service sector or hospitality industry which has its own standards that are extremely lax in comparison to what most would consider international business. ,montreal,ceksmiq,3,t5_2qnmr

214154,0,t1_cf2svwu,You lost me at UK in that this is the Montreal subreddit but Im still familiar with UK politics. I happen to be a BBC junkie Question Time and so on. Although it only reenforces how the English speaking West is going off the same playbook. Were somehow hiring from the same pool of people or school of thought to handle our finances hows our guy doing with your central bank?. Anyway I dont disagree with any of what you said. All true and Id be a fool not to know thats the reality however its the death bed weve made for ourselves. Literally too as the only way I see most people paying off their mortgage debt is through the mortgage life insurance theyre having most people take out on it I dont know if this is a thing in the UK yet. Its possible that back in the financial crash we couldve swallowed the hit but we didnt. Housing prices are again back going up and this gives the illusion of possibly maintaining an ever exponential growth in this sector. I actually received my citys property evaluation not that long ago and it was a huge spike over the previous one which was inexplicable. I even considered selling to buy a newer place... Except these days even a terrible starter house goes for at least kk. k is the cheapest youre looking at thats reasonably close to work. I dont know how anyone starting up now could ever afford these prices. The only things even resembling reasonable are condos k range. The point? I suspect this might be the secret solution at work. Were trying to get the youth into cheaper condos and away from housing and have everyone take out mortgage life insurances. Where does the money come for that? Lets hope its not the same as unfunded credit default swaps.,montreal,cf2u4t4,1,t5_2qnmr

Son histoire ne se prte pas bien  une comparaison avec une situation hypothtique Montralaise.Montral ou tout autre rgion qui chercherait  se sparer dun Qubec indpendant devrait avant tout former une rgion cohrente avec son propre gouvernement autre que municipal et clmer un statut de province ou de rgion indpendante. Ensuite cette rgion pourra commencer les ngociations avec Qubec pour sa propre sparation.Cest vrai quil est techniquement possible de fractionner les pays ou les rgions qui accdent  lindpendance. Un exemple qui pourrait peuttre mieux fonctionner est lclatement de la Yougoslavie qui a donn la SerbieetMontngro pour que quelques annes plus tard le Montngro se spare et devienne indpendant  son tour.Cest quelque chose de possible mais le processus prend plusieurs annes et ce nest pas  lancienne fdration de dcider ce quil advient du territoire.Je suis indpendantiste et je concde facilement quune rgion pourrait  son tour vouloir de sparer du Qubec.

Sure the political elite care about things like the constitution but for a regular person it has no effect on them other than when their friends get drunk and lecture them.As for the dissatisfaction with a government you didnt elect they have less power here than anywhere else in this country and the government you did elect is handling everything the federal government isnt. Things like pastagate are mocked worldwide but that and this resistance you speak of doesnt seem to have changed any laws.

Ce dernier sest prsent vtu dun polo  manches courtes et de pantalons de joggings car il venait de se faire retirer une tige de mtal dans le poignet et la douleur lempchait de porter le veston.Now considering he had a valid reason for not wearing a suit they could have made an exception.On the other hand I understand that wearing a suit jacket might hurt his hand but couldnt he wear something nicer than jogging pants and tshirt?one might argue that its easier to wear such clothes when youre dressing yourself with a damaged hand however one must also consider that the same councilor had showed up previously in inappropriate attire as in not wearing a tie in protest. So its possible he is using this surgery as an excuse to come to the meeting dressed really ridiculously as a form of protest.,montreal,clm42ud,5,t5_2qnmr

2240144,0,t1_clo3spz,That is a pretty strange conclusion to come to. No I am the kind of person very familiar with hacking. The method of leaving a disk of some sort laying around for someone to pickup is like one of the oldest hacks in the book. Sure there are a hundred other ways but getting someone to put a disk in their PC is special because of autoruns code can be immediately executed on that system and owned unless its turned off. Even  if it is off its easy to put content on it to pick their curiosity also this is great to target someone specifically or a business. Go there leave disk walk away. Theres much easier ways to spread a virus online to millions of people than hoping to infect a single computer by leaving a key in the streets.You say that as if that was easy to pull off. Youd have to either . Hack a popular site and get malware on it Like what happened with Pupular Science today or . Create some website and or distribute some file and hope people get this file and execute it. For a website you need to rely on people running old unsecure browsers and bypass whatever security they might have with some ZeroDay exploit. With the method of just leaving a disk you only need to hope someone picks it up and you might even get all their friends along with it. Its like accepting candy from strangers. A compromised system is a very valuable commodity to a hacker especially ones just starting out. So easy and cheap to leave a DVD on a bus with PORN written on it and I bet someone is going to pick it up. USB keys can be bought for pennies from China. And to add people are naturally curios and very few are skeptical so its a soft target. ,montreal,clokqkm,1,t5_2qnmr

2304881,0,t1_clwlahx,Im not talking specifically about damages done by pets. In general whatever the reason is for a landlord to sue a tenant it requires so much work that its often not worth it.A quick exemple my father in law owned a building with  appartments. One of the tenant seemed fine at first... they looked at his credit score confirmed he had a job etc. He paid for the first  months and then lost his job started consuming huge amount of drugs and start to be noisy and annoying for the other tenants. The police was often involved in the middle of the night too... it was a nightmare.He tried bringing him to court but since the junkie had no job theres nothing he could do other than kicking him out and never receiving any money. He had to pay for the repairs himself. Right after that he sold the building and ended up losing money.Edit  Take all of this into account and you would understand that even if the landlords put a no pets rules it could end up hard for him to enforce that rule especially if theres no one complaining and no damages are being done.On the other hand I understand that some tenants would wish to live in a building with not animals mostly for noises.

No one is saying that a company cannot address its CanadianAmerican clients in English but more than a few feel like they have a right to use French in their daily internal operations.And I dont get your point about the debt.

We dont have any. So it always sting a little to see others get exempted from rules or laws that apply to all of us simply because they happen to believe in the supernatural.The young sikh in the soccer team was a great example of that. The ROC was quick to revel in the old myth that Qubcois are nothing but a bunch of racist bigots. But it turned out that no one was against the young sikh wearing a turban... people just wanted nonreligious folks to be allowed to wear the head cover of their choice for the reason of their choice. And this is how the ruling came about and everyone was pleased.If the privately owned Stud gay bar was fined for not allowing a woman on its patio on the basis of discrimination then I shouldnt be barred from going to the municipal public pool in CDN on a tuesday because religious communities believe in some ridiculous shit.Dont get me wrong its their most fundamental right to believe in this ridiculous shit.

Im also afraid that the number of bigots is growing rather than shrinking. I dont think our society is inherently better then others I think its better because of the values we have today values that I feel can and ARE changing. Basically I think its possible to have such a thing as a radical secular society and I feel were getting closer and closer to that. I dont know how to stop it but I get the feeling fighting over scarfs in court is not helping the situation.well if thats the case then the point is moot. giving in to bigotry doesnt lessen bigotry. it reinforces that bigotry as acceptable. having the victims of such bigotry give up their most deeply held beliefs isnt going to help those victims its going to hurt them. it establishes that they will give up their rights to the bigoted majority. to the outsider this issue might be trivial but to the one in the spotlight its an issue of the utmost importance.,montreal,coz9zgb,2,t5_2qnmr

You said we didnt know if that was the case  I was explaining that the h figure was an initial hypothesis that could be verified experimentally but that the principle behind it  loss of gym availability for  of users vs  gain in gym use for X of users was still valid.gt Women paying for those hours means that they will get the hours for themselves and men do not need to pay for time they are not allowed to set foot in the gym.Under the current system men and women pay equally for the gym but the gym environment possibly makes it so that it is less accessible for women.

This means that what happens on that street is not subject to laws touching upon personal space. For example you can be persecuted by the owners if you go in the street and take pictures of them since its a private space in contrast no one can successfully sue you for taking their picture if theyre on a public sidewalk. In other words I guess the sign is there to denote that laws applying to public spaces do not apply in that street. Thats just my guess.,montreal,crfqeld,10,t5_2qnmr

4798261,0,t1_ctz5hzi,Youre actually not wrong about the wind so Im not sure why youre being down voted. My issue is and especially because of environmental issues like this there is only so much you can control. Example from Osbourne street you can hear the  traffic like its in your backyard what are you going to do? Ban the highway? Rebuild it? We were looking for houses in that area and decided not to buy specifically because of the noise. If youre buying property in certain parts of St. Lambert youre just going to have to live with it. Dont buy something knowing full well about the noise levels and then try to change it after the fact.Another thing many concert complainers conveniently ignore is the giant fucking railroad track that goes through half of St. Lambert. That train makes more noise than any concert does. What are you going to do about it?The fact is St. Lambert is almost surrounded by noise. The  blocks that come off Riverside have noise from the . The  blocks around the train tracks have that noise. Believe it or not that doesnt leave much of St. Lambert immune to high levels of noise except maybe preville. And nearly ALL of St. Lambert believe it or not is directly below flight paths of planes coming from St. Hubert airport.So beyond building a giant dome around the city people are just going to have to start dealing with it. Its a fact of life. One that in this case is very hard to control. The best way people of St. Lambert can deal with noise is by adjusting their own expectations of their city and accepting that maybe their town has its flaws... not that its everyone elses problem.,montreal,ctzcyvz,2,t5_2qnmr

I literally have to assume all drivers are crap and lately I feel extremely justified in that position. I would up that number to over  and even higher if you count the people who signal after theyve already initiated their turn. Drivers are already just as bad as cyclists. They just give themselves a pass on a lot of things because on most roads they are single file and theres less chance of an accident with another driver. Drivers dont respect cyclists on the road. For all the complaining we dont get the right of way when we deserve it. Drivers dont think were entitled to know they are turning doesnt matter if its right or left. Were expected to keep way right meanwhile drivers dont want to share the road with us. Its safer to get ahead on a red light Ive never observed a cyclist blasting through one in front of an oncoming car and nearly missing an accident. Most stop and look before going through. Thats more credit than you can give most drivers initiating turns. A cyclist can stare at a driver for  seconds approaching an intersection if you dont signal a left and they go through the otherwise empty stop how come the cyclist is the only asshole in that situation? Quebec has some of the most aggressive drivers out of any other place Ive been in North America. Problem is that everyone is so used to it here that its acceptable. People who visit think Quebec drivers are super dangerous. Meanwhile people in Quebec get mad at Ontario drivers because they actually drive less aggressively. Pedestrians Bikes and Cars are all aggressive here. Everybody cheats where they can get away with it. Im so sick of people turning all the attention against bikes all the time and acting like the others arent so bad. Montreal drivers are just as bad as cyclists.,montreal,cuwvd3j,5,t5_2qnmr

Its an EnglishBritish tradition that is not well known and for Quebecers le jour du souvenir and the poppy are associated with war which in turn have been associated with the conscription. Its not a war in which the Quebecers were very willing to fight or at least not under those conditions. So to them its not entirely their war. Most were forced to go fight for the empire and others had to hide. As much as any Quebecer would be grateful for what those soldiers have done in the past they simply dont have the tradition of wearing a poppy en masse because...  Its an English thing.

6382987,0,t3_433m6g,There are many variables that need to be taken into consideration with gas prices. Obviously there have been documented cases of gas retailers creating cartels and controlling markets but this only represents a tiny fraction of what drives prices. You could look up many other Reddit threads written on the subject that would do a much better job than I ever could but the short form is this Crude oil is only one of many components of the gas youre buying at the station. There is a lot of transportation labour and other chemicals involved in the process which add up to the cost. Currency fluctuations also need to be taken into account. Refineries and retailers all have volume profitability dollars and profitability percentage targets that they are trying to achieve. By changing the price of gas at the pump they are not only changing how much they make per litre sold  they are also affecting how many litres they will sell and in turn how much money they will make as a whole. Basics of demandsupply. They look at what other retailers are charging. If other retailers in a given geography are lowering prices youll want to lower your prices as well to stay competitive. On the flip side if other retailers are increasing prices then theres an opportunity for you to make even more money while not necessarily losing any volume since the competition is also raising its prices.,montreal,czf6dug,3,t5_2qnmr

6526242,0,t3_44zy9q,Theres a fascinating story here.The park as conceived by Frederick Law Olmstead was supposed to be a refuge for upperclass women their children and support staff during the day. The thinking  however flawed by todays standards  was that the upper class was more sensitive and that subjecting their women and children to parks frequented by commoners further south would ruin them corrupt their morals etc. This is one of the reasons Mount Royal is essentially surrounded by suburbs some of which have their own private entrances into the park.The thing is the mountain was still difficult to patrol and Montreal police were way more concerned with public morals back then. The Olmstead trail was originally built with gas lamps and park benches. These were removed soon after the parks opening in  basically because unchaperoned young people were congregating for licentious purposes.Enter the funicular a great tool for social control. The courting couples are all gathered waiting for it at the bottom of the hill and the modest fee to use it kept the poorest i.e. those with lowest morals out of the mix. But as with just about everything built in this city it was built shittily as was the wooden lookout once at the summit. What we have now is far better.Id argue against it. Our public spaces need fewer attractions not more. Also it would require tearing a strip off a protected natural environment. The heritage of the mountain domain is one of the best protected in the whole province. As counterintuitive as it might seem Mount Royal is almost exclusively accessed by Montrealers Tourisme Montral has noted several times in its annual reports that Mount Royal is despite their best efforts one of the least visited parts of the city when it comes to tourists. For some reason tourists dont typically go to Mount Royal Park but they do go to the Oratory.Theres a standing myth in our city that we need more attractions why? By what standard are we comparing ourselves? Im glad we dont have as many attractions as a city like Las Vegas or Orlando or Niagara Falls. Furthermore Mount Royal  as is  is one of the most used parks we have and it crosses all demographic groups in this city. When you give people large open green spaces they often get creative in how they use it. Go for a walk on the mountain in the summer if anything sometimes it feels overused not underused and not in need of additional attractions.By contrast you can go check out the new attractions in the Old Port and ask yourself how many locals have gone there... to the haunted house zip line or piratethemed jungle gym.I dont think thats what Montrealers want.,montreal,czud631,15,t5_2qnmr

They even checked the warranty for one of the problems we had and it turns out it was covered so our bill was like  less and they brought it to the dealer themselves. Theyre pretty honest too. We had another problem at one point and because the issue took less than  hour but they had to charge us for minimum one hour they did extra work on our car to compensate. ,montreal,d30fn8f,1,t5_2qnmr

They were a sort of medieval middle class along with shopkeepers and artisans like you mention but most labouring classes farmed the local lords land and had to hand over a part of their produce to the lord. The nobility was richer and more powerful than yeomen and shopkeepers and artisans because they could extract the surplus value produced by peasant farmers serfs and renters and sharecroppers. Artisans became able to accumulate more wealth as more and more free labour became available after the enclosures but thats centuries after the mythical Robin Hood story.

The beginning of this video   gives an idea about why being on the sidewalk makes you more likely to get hit by a car as well.   Busy roads and impatient drivers can be scary but you are almost always more likely to get into an accident with someone who didnt see you at all instead of someone who saw you and didnt care so being out in the street going with traffic where everyone is looking is the safer option.,montreal,d4vphan,1,t5_2qnmr

As for the comments people just want to be free or that people will only get help when they want. I dont think thats excusable its a catch all. You can say that about almost any negative behaviour. The reality is that we live in a society and we need to follow certain rules and guidelines. You want to be free get a tent live your life in the wilderness do all the drugs you want... the metro isnt a bathroom. Youre romanticizing the homeless population they arent these friendly hippiesvagabonds many are deeply troubled people.There is no easy solution.. but when the conversation is stuck at dont put up homeless deterrents because its immoral then were never going to get anywhere.

Sure. Do I give a fuck? No way. Its fine and dandy to hear about solidarity community entraide etc but really its a bunch of educated dreamers working too hard to help people that dont give a shit about life. There are something like  community organizations in the neighborhood ignoring the ridiculous amount of redundancy they all seem focused on providing some alternative method to healthsafetysuccess. What they lack is stay in school dont do drugs dont get involved in petty crime get a DEPDEC get a job get the fuck out. No amount of community gardens is going to make up for the dietary habits of the residents. No amount of lowcost housing is going to fix multigenerational welfare.

If it pours rain its not a bad way to get inside for awhile but dont waste time inside there if its a nice day and the forecast says it will be great on Saturday.If you like to walk this weekend has some great street fairs. Take the  up from near Place des Arts end of the line is right in front of the large oval shaped UQAM building to MontRoyal and start walking east. The street fair starts around StLaurent and goes for blocks and blocks lots of stuff for sale but also entertainments and street food.Down in Old Montreal near the history museum this is also the weekend for the thcentury market which is also entertaining with interesting stuff for sale retro military guys musicians vaguely traditional food of various sorts people demonstrating arts and crafts and this brings you to Old Montreal where you can ambulate around the old port and so on. The fair is on Saturday and Sunday and would be like  more entertaining than the underground city.Honestly unless youre specifically nuts about plants or gardens I think either the MontRoyal street fair or the historical market are more fun in general and give you more of a look at the city but its a matter of taste. And it is a very good botanical garden.,montreal,d6u7prh,6,t5_2qnmr

Passer devant une entre de stationnement a une vitesse qui ne te permet pas de freiner correctement ou de ragir de manire scuritaire pointe vers une situation ou le cycliste ntait tout a fait prudent. Une piste cyclable nest pas une forteresse impntrable. A tout moment quelque chose peut se mettre devant toi. Tout comme les automobilistes les cyclistes doivent tre attentifs de ce qui se prsentent devant eux. Cest ta responsabilit de te donner des chances de ragir. Si cest un enfant qui croisse la piste cyclable par inadvertance? La piste cyclable ne te donne pas de carte blanche. Ceci tant dit encore une fois JE RPTE il ny a pas suffisamment dinformation dans larticle pour savoir qui est en fait responsable ici. Je ne fais quapporter une contrebalance aux commentaires qui assument que cest entirement la faute du conducteur de la van.

The app also needs more options like family sharing business profile multiple payment methods and fare splitting. They should also completely remove the tipping option that presents an uncomfortable obligation for many people. It should be rolled into the price. Tip expectations of people in the service industry have gotten out of hand particularly in the Old Montreal area. I frequently get unsatisfied frowns with  tips. Its really annoying.

9098854,1,t1_d85hbxo,How does that even make sense?Dog BREEDS were all created for different purposes and have different characteristics that are both physical and behavior related. An ethical breeder tests their dogs thoroughly before breeding to ensure that any dog they create will be as close to perfect as possible. An ethical breeder has a litter once in a blue moon and takes back any dog who can no longer be kept by whoever adopted it. An ethical breeder makes any potential adopters sign a legal contract that states the animal must be neutered and returned to the breeder if the person can no longer care for it. Just because you are used to puppy mill dogs being called pure bred and having a myriad issues doesnt reflect the reality of well bred pure dogs.When I look for a dog I need it to act a certain way. I dont like herding breeds I dont like huskies or primitive breeds because they do not suit my personality. If we had no breeds to choose from getting a dog would basically be a lottery and it would result in even more dogs being abandoned because they did not fit peoples lifestyles.FYI both my dogs are mutts and not pure bred so I dont have an agenda over pure bred dogs.,montreal,d85ja4x,-3,t5_2qnmr
9102471,0,t1_d85wcij,I agree with all the points you made.A pitbull will definitively be more effective fighting dog than a mastiff or a GSD. What they lack in sizebite strength they make up for in tenacity. Not to mention that a mastiff will be significantly slower than a pitbull. Anecdote I have a pitbull type dog who has been in my life since he was  months old. When he was small he would throw himself off the couch if someone came to the door head first sometimes it freaked me out to no end. My mom got a  month old GSD puppy a few months after we got our pittie. She tried to jump off the couch and didnt land too badly but she cried and never attempted it again. I often go to my friends farm and let my dog run around in the woods and Ive seen him run into a young tree that was about as thick as a l soda bottle full force and continue running like nothing happened.

9434282,0,t3_59wekp,gt When the lease is signed the landlord may require the tenant to make the first rent payment and even make that a condition for signing the lease. For example if on April   you sign a lease that takes effect on July  the landlord might require you to pay rent for the month of July at the time you sign the lease on April .gt However the landlord cannot require more than that for example a deposit for the keys to the dwelling or as a safeguard against damage the tenant may cause.Source.gt Would it be difficult to find something in January?Maybe more difficult than for July but not extremely so.See also the wiki from the sidebar.,montreal,d9bv021,2,t5_2qnmr

Major difference being that in the case of Quebec Quebecs position is enshrined in confederation within a confined geography and recognised sovereignty. Settling ghettos in Quebec is an attempt at a hostile takeover.Personally I think their regressive values make them unfit to live in harmony here.

All the police do is sit on the corner and press a button every  minutes. Maybe they shout at you for no reason.  minute cycles are so inefficient. They cause excessive delays. Traffic light design is a very precise science. Cops are not trained for this work and they suck at it.I wish I had more power to change the system. But what do I know I only have a PhD on the subject...  Edit for visibility because my answers below are being downvoted by umambouliTLDR Police are overqualified to push buttons underqualified to manipulate traffic lights while their training handling people goes to waste.

I despise this shit why do you think Im in law school?Anyways we cannot do any thing effective as citizens right now. We dont know if theres secret justification we dont know if its just illegal unconstitutional over stepping thats a one time thing and even if we did the only way a citizen could do anything about this right now is if theyre the judge presiding over this case. We dont know more than we know. Thats not the starting point for mounting resistance. At least resistance that will change things. I didnt say we cant do anything ever please try to at least read and remember my posts if youre gonna criticise and ramble at me so much. I said we cant do anything about it now. Go reread that ffs... if you want to go yell angrily about something dont know or understand to people you dont know who you should be angry at go ahead. You cant even protest government because you dont know if its a government law allowing it that if it is a government law you didnt know whether you should be angry at the Quebec government or the federal government until I had to repeat that multiple times while you resisted that critical information and insulted me for trying to inform citizens to make any upcoming opposition effective.  Anyways all that aside at the moment this is barely explained breaking news about something in ongoing legal proceedings so what are you going to effectively do at this point in time go rant at a judge? You want something to do now in preparation for when the time comes where our canadian citizenry can effectively mount opposition soon enough?please finally note I am not saying regular Canadians just have to sit and accept it because we can never do nothing because were powerless. we are not powerless Learn about our charter protections so that when the time comes you can be more than undirected uninformed and honestly useless outrage. Then youll be effective in voicing your displeasure when the time comes for tangible civilian action. Because there will come a time for action like you want. Im lost on the woods on the drop? What the fuck are you trying to say?Anyways Ive shared the extent of any information I understand on this specific issue and any information you could understand. And youre not someone that inspires me to spend further effort just trying to understand wtf youre saying let alone getting you to the point you understand what the larger story of this topic is. Its been a slice dog go read wiki articles on Canadian charter protections for privacy and against police abusepolice surveillance limitation. Its called the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms and outlines our protection against things like this. Or at least learn to make more sense or realise I agree with your sentiments yet you say I disagree youre so incredibly difficult to talk to.

Then when a car abruptly stops during a left turn the pedestrian gives the finger and points to the green flashing light. I mean maybe theres a surge in people identifying themselves as streetwalking automobiles that Ive missed and they really are entitled to cross at a flashing green light then my bad if Ive offended any selfidentifying streetwalking automobiles during my time on the road.Theres also cyclists thinking they can jump from sidewalk to the road and cross without warning when they have zero right of way pedenstrians jaywalking  meters from a crossing where they are invisible to a turning car cars that treat the pedestrian crosswalk as a stopping line an intersection as a parking zone a yellow light thats been on for  seconds already and theyre still a  meters away as METAL TO THE FUCKING PEDAL MOTHERFUCKER YEEEEEHAAAAW!!!! etc.Theres airheads everywhere but I rarely see such a high number of airheads that break the law and give you the finger when you dont accomodate them their entitlements as I do on the island.Adding a right on red is just going to make things a lot worse.

11509456,0,t1_dg0icrf,I believe most of the mature studios now understand that long crunches and too much overtime will drive people away you will end up losing your senior talent.Overtime has a better yield when its voluntary because the employees are actually willing to put in the time instead of having no choice. I also think that this is partly due to the massive gigantic size of teams at Ubisoft. Back when I was still in school I wanted to join EA because what I read on the web was that you can shine more at EA and youd be just a number at Ubisoft.For a junior shining and rising up quickly sounds much more interesting than being just a number.It can feel true because at studios like EA you can rise up very quickly even with very little experience but youll also quickly realize that no one is there to support you and if you fall you fall from up high. Excuses like its the first time Im doing all this and Im just a junior wont hold. You outta know even if we wont tell you they would say.When I joined Ubisoft I felt a bit lost in a sea of about back then devs just in Montreal. Buddies of mine who left EA for Ubi felt it too.Instead of looking for instant recognition I just decided to do the work until I figure out something. After a while you do get recognition but its not from a manager who just wants you to stay late or go through an impossible task you get recognition from your peers your superiors and even people you didnt know and thats because youve put in the work and put in the time. Im not standing on a nice word from a manager Im standing on  years of experience and multiple shipped games under my belt and thats a much better feeling than the cheap stuff you get elsewhere.,montreal,dg0ljv2,5,t5_2qnmr

It has by far the most people and tends to have the lowest commitment. People DO find relationships there but they tend to start with casual sex or something first. A lot of people just dont admit to have met on tinder because of the implication.  That being said its the easiest to use.OkCupid is a full on dating site search functions filters big profiles. You tend to get a biiittt less of the hookup crowd but since anyone can message you unlike tinder you will still get lots of undesirables anyway.Plenty of fish POF is like OkCupid with less functions same deal though tinder basically replaced it imo.Happn is an app where you only can match people you have crossed paths with. Its got the least number of people and I havent heard of much success but the concept is cool in that you are slightly more likely to match to people in the same area with same interests. Like going to the same parks and shit. But very low user count in comparison.Red flags tends to be something you find on your own. If they seem like a douche or weird. They probably are. Being as thats the images or phrases they specifically chose to represent themselves.Of course if you ever feel threatened you block them report them or in person you leave. Most people are nice if a little awkward. Itll take a couple bad dates before you notice what to look for. Just always meet in public like some pub a park to walk coffee whatever.Just dont be afraid to say no a lot and never feel obligated to answer someone. If they are rude or you arent interested just delete or block them right away. Remember not every person online is an asshole far from it. But EVERY asshole is online. Ya dig?Tinder is probably the quickest to get your feet wet being more comfortable talking and meeting strangers. Just pretend like they arent people but really NPCs in a game or something.

Its a crime with consequences if they choose to enforce it. They will  know you didnt show up. You have a good valid reason to postpone your jury duty so just show up and be honest youll be fine.,montreal,dgynrp3,3,t5_2qnmr
