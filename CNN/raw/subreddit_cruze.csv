The reason that I am even here is because Im looking for some sort of solace for buying this car. My whole life Ive owned used clunkers. Theyve lasted well past what youd expect from them as I take very good care of my cars I dont drive them hard I make sure to stay on top of routine maintenance etc.. About two months ago I decided that I would buy my first brand new car  I had my heart set on a  cruze ltz in red. It was beautiful. I signed the paper work and off I went happy as a pig in shit. Later that day my girlfriend and I decided wed go on a roadtrip and make use of the new OnStar GPS system. It was then that I learnt my OnStar wasnt working. Awell I thought Ill figure it out later. Well later turned in to about  hours of troubleshooting calls with OnStar over a span of just over a month before it was decided that the actual device in my car was faulty and had to be replaced. Day off work for that. After about a week of getting my car back from that work my rear bumper popped out from the drivers side. I had to take it back in for service again and they had to take the back of my car apart and put it all back together again. Another half day off work. That following weekend while driving on the highway I was pulled over by a cop. Apparently my dealership failed to register my plates and I was pulled over for driving with stolen plates. Another half day off work the following Monday to get that taken care of at the DMV. Then this past week one of my speakers has started crackling. I cleaned out all my door trays and tested it by holding down different panels hoping something might be loose. But no it sounds like a speaker has actually started to go. Now Im just waiting on the dealership to call me back with my next appointment. Ive owned this car about  months it hasnt even had its first oil change and its been a plethora of issues. Ive never regretted buying anything more and I feel like a complete idiot for being suckered in. I will never buy a GM product again. The only shitty part now is Im stuck with the damn thing for the next  years. Im hoping in a couple years Ill have enough money that I can just sell it and absorb the loss and get something else. If you have your heart set on this car go for it. But please dont make the same mistake as I did  test drive the shit out of it and make sure you absolutely love it. If you have the same amount of issues as Ive had youll need something to keep you from hating it. ,cruze,cum9tjh,5,t5_2wg7n

6923937,0,t1_d10wviu,Well I was going to say not totally worth it for a manual but for an auto Id say go for it. Its going to give you more aggressive shift points and a bit if a power boost. The power is meh as far as I can tell but Im completely stock besides the tune,cruze,d115i4e,1,t5_2wg7n

Or spend a bunch for new carbon fiber emblems unnecessary if you ask me. i tinted tail lights and side markers roof rack  go badgeless and add some mudflaps! Focus on interior as well! I bought a vehicle with black and red interior to match the exterior color. ,cruze,d9pdcp8,3,t5_2wg7n
11185861,0,t3_5zn52j,I bought a  Cruze LTZ recently and I really like it. Ive been driving Subaru OutbackImprezas my whole life so its a big change but I feel comfortable with it already. My MPG is much better than the older Outback which is nice for my  minute commute. The commuting has actually been pretty enjoyable. Its comfy up front but the back seat is pretty small. Mine fold down for extra trunk space but my taller friends wouldnt really fit comfortably. Mine has a .L but it feels like a .L you wont get breakneck acceleration but it keeps speed well on steep inclines for example.,cruze,dezwke9,1,t5_2wg7n
