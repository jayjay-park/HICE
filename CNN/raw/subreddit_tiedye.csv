1091847,0,t3_26lsw9,My first few shirts had poor penetration just because I wasnt applying enough dye. Best thing to avoid this is to spot check dye penetration carefully while youre applying the dye. Just careful pull apart the pleatsfolds in a few places when you are applying dye to the second side and see if the dye is reaching through to meet the colors you applied to the first side.As for dye chemistry check out these info pagesI recently purchased a big selection of dyes from this company and have had very good results. I believe their fabric reactive dyes are comparable in quality to the procion dyes sold by Dharma but maybe someone else can comment.  They are a little cheaper which is why I bought them. I followed their advice to add urea and ludigol. These chemicals preserve the shelf life of dye after you mix with water as well as improve dye penetration. I just prepared an oz mason jar for each color and keep them stored between tie dye sessions. HTH!,tiedye,chseaa1,3,t5_2tlqa

They have a huge catalog I think you can only order online so the shipping can be outrageous but if memory serves if youre  a new customer they cover samph.But they have a few different options to choose from as far as sizes. The oz jar can definitely get  shirts done.,tiedye,d5nz3zv,2,t5_2tlqa
