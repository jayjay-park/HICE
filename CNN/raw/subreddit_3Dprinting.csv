307819,0,t3_1xm4bp,The company I work at does stuff like this. This technique and the technology for it is not new...many companies have been providing implants for cranial defects for a long time.Our custom cranial guys will get CT scans or DICOM files from hospitals which theyll import into CAD clean up and create implants that get printed on a resin D printer. Then the print is used to make a mold which is used to make a PEEK implant same similar material as the implant in the article. This PEEK implant is what is eventually implanted not the actual D print material. AFAIK most D print material isnt actually biocompatible. There are some printers that can print directly in PEEK which simplifies the process and the turnaround time. Even without directly printed implants our turnaround time is less than  weeks. No regulatory approval is necessary since these fall under compassionate use. edit As ujordandef pointed out the material used in the article is actually PEKK not PEEK. Both are biocompatible polymers,3Dprinting,cfco8rr,8,t5_2rk5q

368208,0,t1_cfiwgi8,gt  Interesting. You were earlier bashing Blender for getting quads relatively recently so tell me if you are so versed in modeling and dprinting which slicer that you are using will slice quads? Or you are the one of those that posts mangled models that I personally repair in Blender?What where?  Youre thinking of someone else dude.  I never complained about getting quads from Blender but that should not be a hard thing to fix.  But just because your dumb ass asked I will tell you that both ReplicatorG and Makerware supports untriangulated .obj files with quads and ngon faces and slices them.  Even still I dont understand why that should be an issue in the first place since triangulating a model should be a click affair.  So I dont understand why you would need to repair them.  And no I have never posted my D models on thingiverse or any D marketplace.gt  First of all the best program is the one that you are familiar with.Earth to dipshit!  Earth to dipshit!  The question asked by OP was from a completely unbiased unknowledgeable perspective.  There is no most familiar program you fucking tool.  OP is a completely inexperienced person asking what program he should invest his time in.  Stop wasting all of our time with this incredible dumb assness.gt  I am sure that there are people out there that can model in Blender what you personally can only dream about  whatever program is it that you are using.Hahaha that was funny.  First of all how can you be so sure exactly?  Honestly do you really think Blender could actually complete with the best modeling programs given  people of equal skill levels?  Feel free to try to change my mind by showing me these models that I could only dream about but I would definitely bet on the fact that anything you can find done in Blender I can find done in Zbrush that is far better or hell even looking at Sculptris models which is also  free program that is hardly even known given that its only been out for around  years now and it absolutely puts Blender models to shame.  You really have no argument here man sorry.  Unless you fucking blow my mind with some impressive models that were done entirely in Blender I really have nothing to say to you.  Most people use Blender with Zbrush or some other real modeling program to do great work because Blender isnt good enough.gt  Second of all if you are saying that whether you are working with Sketchup or Sculptris or Zbrush or D Max or AutoCAD makes no difference if no specific modeling category is targeted you are clearly clueless. I seriously suspect that you ever used any of those if you can seriously state that workflow in those programs are somehow similar.My heads about to explode.  I am so over your dumb ignorant ass.  Where did I say that the workflow for these programs was the same?  Ive always been saying that because the OP did not ask for a specific type of D modeling Ive only ever been talking about the grand scope of D modeling as a whole.  You keep trying to spin your argument in fucking who knows what way as if youre going to prove something.  Youre argument is really a fucking mess dude thats the honest truth.And yes I have professional experience in literally every program you listed lol.  I took  years of mechanical and architectural CAD in high school and I could definitely pick it up again though AutoCAD was a completely D drafting program when I first used it back in .

551987,0,t1_cg30cza,Im still not seeing what youre trying to describe.  The changes in texture that coincide with temperature change due to fan use are not a mathematical artifact math based issues would be universal and repeatable across a predictable curve based on distance from center.  Speed and temp changes will always produce a visible layer difference as your example highlights perfectly.  As I said I acknowledge your mathematical reference which is why I asked you for an STL and setting to look for the issue and you respond with rude behavior.  Im just going to go ahead and block you here.   Be well and I hope you feel better tomorrow.If you seek to make this issue more legitimate I recommend standardizing a single STL and print settings and reproducing the model across multiple printer architectures.   If youd had an example like this Id have sliced it immediately to compare the output from an i and a delta immediately.  This would be a lot more convincing than childish playground talk.  At the very least post examples like this to compare other peoples sidebyside prints for comparison to highlight what it is you believe we should be seeing.  ,3Dprinting,cg30n31,1,t5_2rk5q

560104,0,t3_20jstp,Your company purchased a makerbot. That limits your options a lot. Its not a professional machine. They focus on marketing.The standard format for D printer control is gcode. For some reason makerbot decided to use their own propriety control protocol after years of using gcode.In addition to using a proprietary control protocol theyve decided to fuck the community over and are probably working their hardest to fuck us over further with patent trolling.gtFor me personally I look at a move to closed source as the ultimate betrayal. When I was forced out it was a normal if unfortunate clash of wills where one person must stay and one person must go. I swallowed my ego and left because I knew that the company I founded would carry my ideals further into the world. Regardless of our differences I had assumed that Bre would continue to follow the principles that we founded the company on and the same principles that played a major part in the success of our company. Moving from an open model to a closed model is contrary to everything that I stand for and as a cofounder of MakerBot Industries it makes me ashamed to have my name associated with it.      Zach Hoeken cofounder of makerbot industries.At this point I generally point you towards the tomato parablegtyoure actually asking us to use our skills and knowledge to prop up a corporatized product thats not just practically inferior to the free alternative you ignored but actually bad for the world.Ill try and help but next time maybe see if you can convince work to purchase from a company that isnt actively trying to fuck the community over. Lulzbot builds rocksolid professional machines that are leagues ahead of makerbot.So you need to find something that can talk makerbots proprietary format. The words youre looking for are gcode to xg or maybe xg slicer. It looks to me like GPX is your best bet. It will probably let you convert gcode to xg so you can use whatever slicer you want.But its likely to take a lot of tweaking to get it to work properly.Are you sure its an issue with the slicing? It might be a cooling issue. Point a fan at the whole thing? Get some air flowing? A little bit of airflow will do a lot more than increasing the layer time.Posting some photographs would help. So would posting the gcode for analysis. Pity none of the analysis tools work with xg.,3Dprinting,cg3xuzc,4,t5_2rk5q

1122589,0,t3_23eohp,Let me start this by saying you are getting into a world of hurt. A rewarding area but a world of hurt all the same. I got burned pretty bad on a DP project for a vet that quickly got way above my head. Even though that wasnt a success I got a nice overview of what cancannot be done with DICOM files.That out of the way I assume you are going to want to edit the DICOM and select regions of interest ROI to print versus the whole damn thing. There are a couple very expensive software packages that do this such as Mimics at k a seat  and there are free ones that you can work your way through. The one I used was OsiriX and it actually got my pretty far. There isnt a ton of community or support around it or at least that I didnt find. What this software let me do was select regions of interest such as a bone or lungs from an MRI that I imported export a d surface bounded object not a volume but treated as a D object as an .obj file which I could then edit in CAD like SkethUp eventually leading to DP from the CAD.If this is what you are interested in I am happy to go into more detail.

1319299,0,t3_296yn4,If you spend more than  for a consumer fff printer  chances are that you are getting ripped off.   There are exceptions  I personally dont feel makerbot is one of them however. Check out the following lineup no deltas as in not as familiar with them Mendelmax . Fusematic Ultimaker Taz  MAll are priced well  and offer the ability to print just as well  if not better  than a more expensive consumer fff printer. Even a well built printrbot can print just as well  but more rigid machines hold adjustments better  and as such  are more frequently labeled as better.Tuning a printer is a tedious process certainly  but if you take extra time to set it up print and label calibration models for reference and only change one thing at a time  you will be met with success.  The same goes for nailing down print settings  change one thing at a time to gauge effect and notate the adjustment for reference. If you want great prints  first step is bed leveling and z home placement.  If you get crappy first layers  generally those errors will only compound. Make sure your extrusion is the diameter you tell your slicer.  Make sure the same for filament diameter.  Try to make your first layer at least  of your extrusion diameter  and never make your layers thicker than  of your nozzle or extrusion diameter.If you have overhangs use more perimeters for dramatic overhangs  use a cooling fan. A fan is a must for pla and is great for abs overhangs. Make sure your extrusion path from extruder gear to nozzle orifice is a perfect straight path.  Ensure your extruder path is free of obstruction  including old burnt or gummy material. Use different tips  if applicable when switching material types. Coming from a terrible printer design fabhome model  to a wonderful design  mendelmax . I can tell you that the rigidity and reliability of a good design is well worth the extra money.  I rarely have to adjust anything other than slicer settings. ,3Dprinting,cii1ds3,5,t5_2rk5q

1529426,0,t1_cj7wltw,Ill agree that it might not be actual backlash.  However the flats on either side of the cylinder are classic backlash symptoms.  If its not backlash its something else that acts exactly the same way.  I just thought it would be simpler to refer to it as backlash.  The cube is also shortened in the Y direction by the same amount the cylinder is flattened but its a lot harder to see that in a photo.  The surface finish isnt the issue its the flats on the sides.  The surface is actually quite nice though Ill admit it might not look that way in the photo.The belts and everything are as tight as can be.I have tried it with extremely low speeds and accel and it comes out exactly the same.The error is not in the Z axis.  Its not in any way Z related.  Also there are  steps per mm in the Z direction.  The amount of error that would be imparted by having a layer height thats not evenly divisible by the Z stepsmm would be so small as to be completely undetectable.  th of a millimeter! This is actually true of most repraps where the Z has even more around  steps per mm.

That means either D printing or machining a replacement plug or I dunno a threaded metal or foil insert which doesnt seem like a great option.

Between the i and solidoodle if you want to build your own machine and know the ins and outs allowing you to diagnose problems and customize your machine for improved results build an i and plan to spend  hours building and configuring before you are producing good quality prints.

1622373,0,t3_2cvxf6,For my DIY TAZ I originally went with a ED V but I wasnt too fond of it. I had a lot of problems with clogging. That was partially a problem with the filament but I think the design was also part of the issue. Its also annoying having to always run a fan although thats unavoidable with all metal hot ends. Securing the thermistor with kapton tape also didnt work very well and I ended up having to used RTV silicone to hold it in place.So I switched to an Ubis hot end and Printrbot Aluminum extruder which seems to work really nicely and is much more compact than the Gregs reloaded extruder. The obvious downside is temperature but Im willing to sacrifice that.The Budaschnozzle that comes on the TAZ printers also works pretty nicely but people have issues with clogging its not all metal and its fairly large for a hot end.,3Dprinting,cjjnz6d,1,t5_2rk5q

1923191,0,t1_ckktexs,uwhoisjoecarr is incorrect in saying thatgt Slicr should recognize the wall thickness and extrude more to get your walls to touch.As I said extrusion width remains constant through a slicing task and if set to auto depends on a few factors  primarily your nozzle diameter and your layer height.  There is a parameter called WidthoverHeight WoH that can help here.  There are safe values for WoH that are known to produce good results for flow and material deposition and typically you want to be somewhere around a value of ..  Values below .. can lead to weak parts and poor overhang performance and values above . mean there is a lot of extruded material squish with diminished feature detail.  You can do the math yourself for your nozzleIf you want to use a layer height of .mm and aim for a good WoH value of . your extrusion width should be set to something around .mm.  Since you have a .mm nozzle this should be fine and its indeed the process Slicr uses to figure out what your auto extrusion width should be.  If you want to print .mm layers and maintain the same WoH youd need an extrusion width of .mm.  This is well below your .mm nozzle diameter which while achievable will mean you have to overdraw your filament to make a line that thin.  This is where the extruded plastic is stretched or elongated as its being deposited not great for a number of reasons.  In this case you may want to play within the acceptable WoH range to get a bigger extrusion width if you go all the way up to a WoH of . you can use an extrusion width of .mm.  But this will still result in overdrawing which isnt ideal.  Its better to start with your nozzle diameter pick your favourite WoH and see what layer heights would be achievable and not go much below that.  For example a .mm nozzle and a WoH of . would let you go down to .mm layer heights without overdrawing.  If you push that to WoH of . you can achieve .mm layer heights.  From experience .mm layer heights seem to be a good lower range for a .mm nozzle.Now back to your original question about extrusion width and thin walls you are correct.  If you have an extrusion width of .mm and walls that are .mm you can fit  perimeters with no gaps.  Or  perimeters at an extrusion width of .mm.  This is why I said I like to use an extrusion width of .mm because I can model parts and walls in even increments of .mm easily and dont have to figure out what is a multiple of some other extrusion width number.The only exception to this rule is if youre making circles and arcs.  D printer controller boards cant do circular interpolation so every move is defined as a straightline path between two points.  If youre printing a circular part the way STL files work mean that each circle is actually defined as a sequence of straight line segments you could have  lines making the circumference of your circle but from far away this looks round enough.  This can cause problems if you make a thin wall cylinder with a wall thickness of .mm and hope to use an extrusion width of .mm.  See the diagram I made for you hereThe dashed lines are the true cylinder walls youre hoping to make and the solid lines are what the STL has turned your cylinder into.  From far away it still looks like a cylinder but in reality its just a bunch of straightline sections.  To maintain dimension accuracy these straight line sections are inscribed within the cylinder wall boundary but this means that any straight section will have a width less than .mm as shown in my diagram.  If you try to use an extrusion width of exactly .mm here youll get some weird slicer results with gaps similar to what youve found in your initial post.  Here you might want to use an extrusion width slightly below .mm or bump up to two thicker perimeters to get good plastic fill.  For this reason when I say I like to use an extrusion width of .mm I technically have my extrusion width set to .mm all the time and just make models as if its .mm.  This allows me to print circular features without having anything weird happen in the slicer and still have great plastic fill for square parts.Hope that helps explain a few things!,3Dprinting,ckkxivo,5,t5_2rk5q

The way the pellets pack in the auger the way the temperature varies C is normal impact extrusion output speed several percent. These fluctuations may have a period of minutes or tens of minutes. No practical loop or buffer would keep up over a long print. The only way to do it would be to adjust the speed of the print based on the size of a loop or buffer and if youre going to do that why not add one motor and spool it in between?,3Dprinting,ckthqjc,2,t5_2rk5q

This gives it an advantage over PEEK based hotends right off the bat since they cant go over C and therefore cannot print polycarbonate and other advanced materials.Of allmetal hotends it is by far best in class. Other designs Prusa comes to mind are very prone to jamming. Some designs do the nozzle and heat block all in once piece Pico so you cannot change nozzle sizes easily. The Pico also has quite a long melt zone. It is not great with PLA. The Pico also costs  more than the EDv.Finally the EDv uses a fully constrained filament path which means it can print flexible filaments like NinjaFlex much faster and more reliably than other designs.But Im a ED US distributor so dont take my word for it.

I had some threaded rod wire and insulation I was reusing and printed my own parts. Another  should get you all that. Make the box maybe three inches deeper than the design says it will be easier to mount your power supply and electronics. I had a really hard time with the z axis staying perpendicular to the bed so the hot end distance to the bed would change a lot on me. I ended up mounting the box to a full floor about x. I used some fastener blocks from the Mendel repo but you could buy them at a hardware store. So worth it. The endstops I got didnt match the pattern on the clips so be prepared to modify.

You may not have a choice in this because youre not self sourcing the RP parts so again stick with the design.

Youll also need one spool per printer unless you want to work with loose coils.Software should all be free. Software for running the printer is all free Repetier Host Slicr Cura etc. Software for modelling can likewise be free TinkerCAD for simple models or younger students and Blender or OpenSCAD for more complex or parametric models.You may also want to reach out to others that have integrated D printers into their classrooms   Official Education Arm of Make Media  DesignMakeTeach is a guy on Twitter who has several Printrbot Metals in his high school classroom and is pretty active in the educating educators sphere  Make Magazine is probably worth getting a sub too and keeping copies in your classroom as well.  ,3Dprinting,cm8y5kj,1,t5_2rk5q

2465754,0,t3_2nsmo5,My D printer is a Rostock MAX v with an aftermarket ED V hot end. The V is rather different than the stock Rostock hot end so a custom mount is needed. You cant buy a molded plastic mount as everyone just prints their own. Mine was this modded so that the  legs are separate from the top bracket Id made a mistake when setting it up and given the wiring loom a bit too much slack. About a week ago when starting a fairly big print the loom caught on the pointy edge of one of the effector platforms rods. I happened to be standing at the printer watching it when this happened so managed to clear the jam in under a second but the print was already ruined. It seemed fine after that though so with some minor recalibration I restarted the print and went about my business.Today I went to warm up the printer for a couple of prints. My informal startofday checklist includes moving the head around a bit as well as testing the extruder and I happened to notice the platform suddenly tilted when I went past a certain X distance. On closer examination I saw this. I guess itd been stressed continually over time and chose today to let go. If not for the jam it mightve lasted a good while longer surprising me out of the blue some time in the distance future.Two life lessons Dont print structural components with  infill and always print spares in case you need them. Instead of printing Ill be spending today visiting hardware stores trying to find some parts I can use to approximate a new set of legs for my hot end mount.EDIT I happened to have the right sizes of M standoffs and screws to build my own legs for the Vs platform  see the last image in the gallery for what this looks like.,3Dprinting,cmgguhp,2,t5_2rk5q

2479379,0,t3_2nywqj,What do you want to do with it?  If you wont be making larger objects the Printrbot Simple Metal is a great machine.  The auto bed leveling is also nice.That being said I bought my M in  and its still going strong with heavy use and Id have no problem pitting it against any of the newer machines that have come to market.  Not many other machines have this kind of track record simply because they havent been around as long.  I also use the larger build volume quite a bit and need the heated bed I actually built a heated enclosure for the parts I make mechanical parts robotics etc..If the bigger build volume isnt a requirement for you and cost is a driving factor Id suggest the Simple Metal.  That being said my biased opinion is that I would buy the M again given the choice.  If you have more specific questions about the M Im happy to answer.,3Dprinting,cmi6y4q,3,t5_2rk5q
2480878,0,t1_cmi9tde,The Metal Plus does look really interesting and theyve adopted a lot of the features of the M same moving Y axis configuration small footprint linear rails steel construction etc..  Unless Im missing the link it looks like the only version of the Metal Plus that includes a heated bed costs  vs  for the M OP was looking at.  The reason for the price jump on the Metal Plus is that the base model only runs on V which needs to be changed to V before using a heated bed.  I also prefer the Rambo board in the M vs the Printrboard because you can do more with it if youre a tinkerer.  Will the Metal Plus come with a borosilicate glass plate like the M?  I cant see anything about it but I consider glass to be a really good addon.  The last thought I have is that there arent any SimplifyD profiles for the Metal Plus to get up and running quickly since it hasnt been released yet.  I only mention this last thought because I agree with uMchawkeye that SD is a good investment.  None of these differences are insurmountable just things to consider.I dont really see how the Metal Plus is a lot nicer considering all the similarities and the fact that nobody has it yet.

We have automated quoting and our algorithms take in to consideration a lot of different factors to estimate the actual material and time used. Heres some thoughtsSLS  Even though there are no supports you cant  reuse the neighboring powder without some sort of material refreshment. This means the client should be paying for a reasonable amount of neighboring material in that build.DMLS  Often you are angling the part so your actual XYZ dimensions are not as they seem. Also your supports are fully metal which means the more support the more labor intensive the parts will be.PolyJet  Support material is less expensive then the build material but still very expensive relative to other processes. If you dont cover your grounds on support needed you are in for a loss.We do a lot of data analysis on our quoting to make it more accurate but we will get oddballs every now and then which will throw our current formulas over review.,3Dprinting,cn88tys,1,t5_2rk5q

While yes they can make a  micron layer you are still limited in resolution to  microns in xy. A polyjet printer like the Connex  has several hundred nozzles about .mm in diameter. I know that it does not seem like it threads need to be far more precise than they appear at first. FDM printers even when perfectly calibrated do not handle threads finer than about an Mx. and even then they are marginal. Source I have run benchmark prints on pretty much every printing technology currently available. This included printing threaded holes in a variety of sizes. For making small thread the only real option is a very high resolution model and an polyjet printer. ,3Dprinting,cnoz0ef,1,t5_2rk5q

2843644,0,t3_2snudk,Ahahaha this reminds me of an interesting story. So im only  years old now but a couple years ago when I got my first D printer my parents had often grounded my brother and consequently sometimes me for bad behaviour. What they typically did was take our xbox or something and lock it in their closet until they felt like we needed it back. Me and my brother were no spring chickens when it came to picking locks so my parents installed a special lock that required a very specific shape of key to bump which we could never acquire. Until one day i got ahold of the key took pictures of it at every angle with my caliper in hand for measurements and put it back. I modelled a perfect bump key for the shape of it and when our parents were gone one day I printed it in ABS and we went upstairs to try it. We stuck it into the lock and sure enough it fit. My brother got a hammer and tapped the bottom of the key and it instantly snapped in half lodging half of the key into the doorway. We couldnt get it out and our parents came home and saw it stuck in there. And thats how i almost got grounded from having a D printer at . ,3Dprinting,cnrbjy0,20,t5_2rk5q

2910165,0,t1_cnypdfv,My experience with ABS has been that printing directly onto Kapton tape as long as the bed is hot and the Kapton is clean works amazingly well. Some people will mix up some ABS juice ABS dissolved in acetone to treat the surface for even better adhesion but as long as the bed is hot enough I havent found that necessary.PLA will also print directly onto Kapton tape but Ive found it a little bit fussy. Sometimes it just wont stick very well to the tape or the brim will start to lift up early and you can kill the print right there because it will probably fail before its finished. The blue painters tape has worked really well though even without a heated bed. Just lay down  strips whatever it takes to cover most of your print area and press them down firmly.With painters tape I find that cleaning the top of the tape with alcohol makes the bottom layer adhere LIKE CRAZY but it also makes the print stick to the tape in places and means the tape has to be replaced after every print. If you can avoid the alcohol the tape will usually release the print without damage for  prints. At some point the top of the tape will just have too much crap on it and the filament wont stick to it anymore. Thats when I clean it with alcohol and get one last print out of the tape.And yes painters tape right on the heated bed. At  degrees recommended PLA bed temp the tape has no issue with the heat. When I use painters tape I usually have Kapton tape on the bed and then the painters tape on the Kapton tape. Most of the materials are pretty forgiving.,3Dprinting,cnyw5z8,1,t5_2rk5q

3066790,0,t1_cofv21q,Well I suppose I just generally disagree but luckily I have the skills and experience to prove what I believe so Ill keep working on that.The layers arent that big of an issue BTW. Large diameter nozzles actually have better layer adhesion characteristics and if you design an item specifically to be printed you can make cheap good looking and strong chairs tables desks storage units and more. See this link for more on that Im already building robots almost entirely out of printed parts and it works well. This would mean open source designs could have significant real world value. Much of my optimism about the value of D printing is that unlike injection molded or machined parts D printing really allows for open source manufactured parts. If something has very little material cost very little energy is required to make it and the design can be freely acquired the thing itself will be very cheap. For some manufactured things this cost savings may not matter but I think in the long term we will see certain things that do make sense to print even on a large scale.If we can make robots that cost almost nothing and those robots can do the work we need to survive then we can build a selfsufficient society for cheap. Thats a big deal.,3Dprinting,cofvax6,1,t5_2rk5q
3068920,0,t1_cog1phn,gt I dont really have time for a new hobbyAs simple as the Printrbot is any consumer D printer on the market is going to require you to treat it like a hobby especially for the first few weeks while you are learning the ins and outs. I can now fire off many successful prints without any issue but I still have to troubleshoot at least once a week I use my printers daily whether it is an issue with slicing software the filamentfilament settings used. I wont ever call it headache free but for under  this or the Metal Plus will give you the least amount of headache. gt it seems like things are getting to where I can make something with D printing with relatively little effort.Lets say that I want to make two working gears. I have to find the file. Import it into a slicer. Set my settings because you can specify how weakstrongsolidhollow an object will be as well as a resolution and print speed. Once you have your settings confirmed selected your filament measured it and entered the true diameter in Slicr you will begin to slice the file. This takes a d file and translates it into motor movements that the printer will execute while extruding the plastic. So now you heat your printer or already did this first to save time and run the file. If non heated bed you will need to do the painters tape and alcohol trick. If a heated bed you will occasionally replace the Kapton tape and use something like glue or hairspray to keep certain plastics ABS from peeling even with the bed.   So then everything just works?No. You will need to clean the platform between every few prints I clean on every print. Your nozzle WILL clog eventually and will require you to remove it and clear the clog. Belts will need to be tightened over time. Over time small issues can manifest and you will need to troubleshoot what is the source of the issue. They may not be major issues but in the example of making two working gears issues can arise that cause parts not to fit together and you will need to figure out what the cause is. So while you can buy this printer follow all directions download Cura or Repetier HostSlicr add a model and use someone elses settings fairly easily it isnt a matter of if you will need to know how to pinpoint an issue or change a setting with your printer but a matter of whenEdit feel free to ask me any other questions that you may have. I hope that I didnt scare you away from this awesome technology I only wanted to give you a realistic expectation as the technology is not quite turn key. However using Cura on a Simple Metal is much easier than the combination of Slicr and Repetier Host and will provide something closer to a turn key experience. You may find more tutorials for Slicr and Repetier but Cura is what I use when giving D printing demonstrations because of the simplicity. ,3Dprinting,cog393d,15,t5_2rk5q

3214414,0,t3_2wx4ii,I really like this idea. Its one of those things that may take an immense amount of work for it to be beneficial. There may be many failures but it makes sense to me that in the end under the right conditions some sort of a chemical binder may very well help micro adhesion. Be sure to save this post so when Makerbot patents your idea whoever they choose to bully can fight them in court Im saving mine.Many good ideas so far all worth a shot. Mine is the followingModify the brass nozzle by making fine slits in it dremel? as shown here Buy some fine syringes or syringe tubing from McMasterCarr and place the fine syringe pipes in the slits so they can be used to squirt acetone out next to the extrude hole. Use JB weld to fill the slits leaving pinprick holes near the nozzle where acetone can be piped through. Attach the pipes to a system capable of pumping minute quantities of acetone down through the hoses to be vaporized by the hotend and out as a gas right next to the extruded stock.Step two is to hook the pump up to a fan controll already present on your printer. This way you should be able to adjust the fan power between  and  to adjust the acetone flow rate to the part. The benefit here is that experimentation with this idea now becomes experimentation with volume flow rate and actual fan settings to clear the vaporized acetone.Now Im not sure JB weld can stand up to acetone so youll have to check it. In addition finding a pump that can handle acetone and minute amounts may be difficult. Making your own may be easier but you never know what you will find.NOTE The ideas expressed I choose to gift to the open source community. The ideas expressed are my own and are original.

To try and compensate for this I upped it to C to try and blast my way through those imperfections so they dont put up much resistance. Experience has told me that leaving the print asis would cause the tiny bumps and ridges to cause excess accumulation and extrapolate to the head completely knocking off the print from the raft.

I thought it would work considering the main function of the d printer i would be using is to print parts for model rocketsAs for the other point you mentioned this idea started as a cool way to replace a broken club. Since then i just bought a new set of clubs. But i was recently reminded of this idea and i want to try it as a learning opportunity. It will teach me a lot about d design and if it works it will be an awesome addition to my collection of juggling gear.I could look at almost any post in this subreddit and ask why would you print that when you can go to walmart and but one for ? But simply getting the object isnt the point of d printing. The point of d printing is to advance methods of making stuff.

When I flashed my DaVinci with Repetier I didnt lower the print bed so when I tried printing for the first time the print head hit the bed and the motor started skipping. Ever since then theres some lateral play in the print bed. Initially I thought that would ruin print quality completely but surprisingly it had little effect  all my calibration prints turned out better than expected of a  printer. Im going to post on Voltivo forums to see if other DaVinci owners experience the same backlash. Looking at the print though I dont think the bed was moving to cause this kind of peeling up.,3Dprinting,cpbeo0i,1,t5_2rk5q

3436475,0,t3_2zgw3g,I dont have this particular printer so my advice might not be the best.  That being said this is what I would try in order of least expensive to most expensive. Make sure there is no slack in your x and yaxis timing belts. Make sure the wheels on your gantry plates are spaced evenly.  You want a small bit of friction and an even amount of friction on each wheel of a plate. Put more binder clips on your glass plate.  My old Makergear Ms glass bed would actually slide during the print so I literally bought a package of  mini binder clips and clamped the glass down with all of them. Clean out your extruder.  Since this is your first print this probably isnt an issue.  However since it is a relatively easy problem  to fix I thought I would mention it Try different slicing software.  I switched from Slicr to Cura and my prints were immediately better Try printing the cube again but make sure the filament is always slack like in this video   If this helps the quality of your print get a filament guide and a PTFE tube you dont need to switch to a Bowden as the video implies Change your cooling setup.  The right fans can really make a difference.  However I would ask someone else with your printer model for further advice. Reinforce your frame.  You could do what uswirvbox did and bolt it down or use the same VSlot that Makerfarm uses for their linear rail.   is where you get it.  I love this stuff.  In fact I am using this to rework my KITTAZ. Try a different filament.  Ive had great results with Protoparadigm Lone Star and colorfabb. Try a different extruder.  I havent tried this yet but I have heard that switching to an ED can helpThats all I can think of off the top of my head.  Like I said before I dont have an iv so some of my suggestions may not be the best for your printer but I hope that was helpful,3Dprinting,cpjzf70,2,t5_2rk5q

I have had to look in the Gcode to figure out what was going on but it was there clear as day.  When this happens the result is pretty similar to what you see here.

Companies such as kinkos have a clause in their terms of service saying that you agree that you have the ownership rights or proper permission from the copyright holder to duplicate the item and that any legal consequences are the users alone to bear. A print service like shapeways also has a similar clause. gtFedEx Office takes no ownership in any Materials uploaded to the FedEx Office website except FedEx Office retains its rights in and to the Content that is present on the site or that may be created andor supplied by or for FedEx Office.gtYou also warrant and confirm that You own the copyright or have permission to copy any documents or Materials You submit online for printing or processing and agree to defend indemnify and hold FedEx Office its parent and its parents subsidiary companies and their respective officers directors agents and employees harmless from any suit demand or claim arising out of any breach of this warranty and agree to pay any judgment or reasonable settlement offer resulting from any such suit demand or claim and to pay any attorneys fees incurred by FedEx Office in defending against such suit demand or claim. In OPs case it is a bit complicated. If OP was offering his printing service and a customer came in with a model and OP was clear to the customer that they need to have the right to reproduce said file and that any liability lies with the customer then he would be in the clear. The burden would be on the customer to get the proper license. If OP is offering to print out someone elses model for a customer then it gets more dicey. OP is liable since he is the one providing the file. OP has to read up on the license permissions of the file whether it is public domain creative commons noncommercial and so on. If there is no such info OP has to contact the owner of the file and obtain permission or a license from the owner. With a public library they might also have it in their agreement that the user will not infringe on anothers copyright. Public libraries also have fair noncommercial use protections since they are charging for the upkeep of their printers and are not making a profit through the sales of print services. TLDR OP should make sure he has the permission to sell the object from the original owner. ,3Dprinting,cpw67zm,1,t5_2rk5q

Maybe you can adjust your zhome screw so that the head is a tiny bit closer to the bed. The other possibility is that the bed has hand oils an such on it. try wiping down the bed with rubbing alcohol and printing again. If the head is moving too fast on the first layer your slicing program should have an option to run the first layer slower than the rest.

I get that in some instances things like this can be legally and morally grey but to me the OPs intention seems totally reasonable. Maybe legally there are some questions but the tone of your argument implies you think this is wrong which I just dont understand at all. A lot of these arguments are also missing the point that OP would still have to print the model and likely glue things to it cut bits off it and make other parts of the costume from scratch.

After you get printer  this one becomes used for smaller build  testing potentially cloggyfilaments etc if its able  For me this was an Up Mini    Printer   the one you purchasedmade when you worked out what you wanted and needed a larger build areadual extrudersbetter x provided you didnt buy a lemon this printer becomes your workhorse for big prints and optionally paid prints for customersfriendsetc  For me this was a Flashforge Creator Pro    Printer   the one thats different or the one youll end up using for custom Copperfillbronzefillcarbon fibre or super detailed jobs casting resin figurines while the workhorse printer continues churning out day to day things For me this will be either a resinbased printer LittleRP or one of the new SinterIT printers. It may be more reasonable to sell printer  before you get number  depending on your circumstances and available cash. Having  also makes sense if youre earning money off of them because you always have a backup printer to cover costs for one that is offline due to any issues. What does everyone else think?

4280371,0,t3_3a06dq,It really depends on what your situation is.  What makes it good for me might be different for you.  For example if you need to move it a lot youll need a sturdy machine.  Live in a dorm room youll want a small machine.  Want to make model rockets get something that makes tall prints.  Want to print with copperfill youll need an all metal extruder.  Delicate top heavy or unstable prints youll probably want a Delta or something with a stationary bed.  Replacement parts for a boat  car stay away from PLA that can melt when it gets wet.  For me I wanted A solid machine I could transport to my kids school Larger print area to keep my options open Headed bed  and extruder that gave me lots of print material options.  Ive found I also like the ability to print from an SD card and the display more useful than I thought it would be.  I didnt think Id care about print resolution or printing multiple colors and thats largely true so far.  My prints are utilitarian or for fun not for show.  Two color printing seems kinda silly to me anyway. I do with I had a duel extruder to print support material differently a use case hasnt come up yet ... so it might be something thats just not a big deal.    Edit One more thing be careful when buying a kit.  Some kits require a lot of work and know how.  Read the manual before you buy.  Some kits go together quickly some kits take  hours or more.  If opening up your computer makes you sweat just buy a pre assembled machine.   ,3Dprinting,cs847w0,3,t5_2rk5q

Red ABS of any type you should be able to up the print temperature to around  and maybe get a smoother overall print. if it starts turning brown and catching on fire you probably went too far heh. You also really shouldnt need a fan for ABS at all except for very small extrusion sections or for bridging.I usually print final pieces at much higher than  infil.

Silver ABS prints at a little lower temperature than darker colors so you may want to lower the temperature to  or so once you get the extrusion rate dialed in. Also if you are printing ABS you dont need the duct at all except for small part areas or bridging. It should be off except when performing those activities. Cura should have a setting for that.

Especially when youre spending  having the confidence in their return policy is a nice thing to have on your side...It arrived two days later with one piece of tape stretched perpendicular to the way you open a box like this Certainly not sealed like you would hope any product should during shipping. To top that off it wasnt placed in a master shipper standard nondescript brown box it was clearly labeled D Printer with pictures and features something you would see on a show room floor to help sell the product or in my case for any passerby to steal it from my doorstep. So okay this is an Amazon problem not Robo... but then I opened the box and found two small zip bags one contained a thumb drive for software and the other containing a spare YAxis belt tensioner. Inside of the bag there was a small piece of paper that clearly looked like someone quickly printed out and cut with scissors in Calibri size  font P saying Spare part YAxis. I thought okay Thats considerate but damn these parts could have easily fell out of the box with that tape job...Unpacking the box seemed normal no visibly broken parts good protection for the glass print bed foam every where tools bagged up in bubble wrap...not bad at all. I setup the printer and start my first calibration cube and it only prints this Uh oh we have a Yaxis problem...no wonder they gave me the spare part. So they knew? I then started to inspect the print bed area and noticed a very loose screw Ok..time to inspect the Ybelt area. I ended up finding the entire Ybelt and its broken tensioners just sitting below the print bed I took this picture after to show customer support Well they only provided one spare part and two of mine were broken...  I was frustrated that this brand new  machine labeled as assembled and fully operational out of the box was not what I paid for so I immediately jumped on a live chat with Amazon to let them know what happened. Well as I was telling the Amazon guy my situation I was thinking No shit sherlock you have a D printer...you could just model this part and print it on my very slow MD Micro printer and then youll be good. So I told the Amazon guy I felt that I could possibly fix it but Im worried that something else maybe wrong.. He says you have three options. Amazon will give  back and you can try to repair or get it fixed.. Amazon will send a shipping label for return and theyll send me a new one.. Amazon will send a shipping label for return and theyll refund my money.I was a bit flustered and told the guy to give me a few minutes to think about it...about  seconds of silence goes by and he says tell you what well give   tax back on the purchase for you to repair it and if it still broken or if something goes wrong before September th well send you a new one and you can keep the   tax. I said DEAL! So with tax I ended up getting back  dollars and with a quick ROBO D forum search I found that this was a problem most people had and the solution had already been posted! So I replaced one of the tensioners with my spare part and zip tied the other one found the STL file printed it and was up and running completely about  minutes after the conversation with Amazon. I keep it well oiled on the mechanical parts check belt tension and always clean the extruder amp bed and she runs just fine. Plus if I have an issue within the next few weeks I can get another one at no cost and if anything happens within  months its still within warranty. Also I contacted ROBO D support and they responded immediately with two spare parts at my door  days later and a discount on filament.I know I probably should have sent back the device and got a new one but Im an engineer. I honestly have a pride issue with not fixing things myself...  I hope this helps your process in buying a new printer whether its the one I got or making sure you stay far away from it! In any case good luck man!TLDR Printer arrived slightly damaged complained to Amazon and got tax back fixed the printer  minutes later and havent had a problem since.Edit Moved TLDR to a visible place.,3Dprinting,cuac4ml,3,t5_2rk5q

Printing long skinny things can be challenging but it is doable especially if you can print it off a sacrificail raft that you can later trim off. If at all possible try to keep all your walls and structure at least mm thick or more.

I also havent really used any CAD software from the past  years or Illustrator from the past  years.However a quick Google search for  Design import formats doesnt seem hopeful. They are happy about their SVG import ability.My only other thought is to outline your drawing in a box of even dimensions and then rescale the D drawing after importing it so that the calibration box is the expected dimensions. Or otherwise include calibration marks that can be used to rescale in CAD to the proper dimensions.Wild guess here but the CAD tool is probably just scaling the nounit SVG to fit its open canvas. Thats pretty much what SVG does on a web page. So maybe you could have a standard perimeter rectangle in Illustrator that matches the canvasviewwhatever size of  Design and it will scale itself that way.,3Dprinting,cvl4o3g,1,t5_2rk5q

5335172,0,t3_3o1d61,. As was stated before microwaves rely on water molecules to heat things. Secondly it would be difficult to measure the temperature of the melt zone. With large diameter filaments you could end up with a hot pocket effect where the center is boiling lava hot and the outside is cold although this is really due to hot pockets being frozen. What Im really trying to say is that even heating might not be trivial. . an iris type nozzle while not impossible would take some serious engineering.  The first obstacle is size machining parts of this size is not easy or cheap. The tolerances would have to be super tight to prevent leakage.

There is no exclusive agreement for the LulzBot Hexagon and it is open source hardware jebba sought out resellers and demanded they no longer use the LulzBot trademark jebba then sought out resellers and told them that they had to be compliant with the GPLv to resell clones of the Hexagon AO.  Im sure you know whats wrong with this  a physical product from the manufacturer that LulzBot sources the Hexagons from are not clones there was previously not LulzBot Hexagon or LulzBot v to clone and there is no requirement in the GPLv to link to source files of a physical product that cant be copyrighted therefore cant be copylefted.

I just recently made a couple prints at  micron and the detail is fascinating no issues arose and the client was pleased. I did notice very fine hair like plastic protruding wherever the extruder jogged to its next location but Ive read that this can be fixed through the settings by drawing the filament up before the extruder travels.Ive read the TAZ involves a bit of set up before printing.

5453829,0,t1_cw8juco,Well we can calculate the sort of discharge you would expect to see if uPsiOryxs claim is feasible.An energiser A battery is the size used in most cheap callipers and can be assumed to be a reasonable representation of a typical battery used in digital callipers. Now energiser claim the typical capacity of an A is mAh  a nominal voltage of .V capacity is actually higher for low current devices like callipers. So we can estimate the battery has about .x..Wh of energy.So uPsiOryx claims that a simply touching a battery will take years off its  year life. To be conservative lets say  touching that battery takes a year off or  of the stored energy. This would mean .Wh of energy is drained over the period of a single touch. Assuming a touch is about  second long this equates to .x.W of energy over a  second period. Assuming that is all delivered at the nominal .V that would be ..A of current for the duration of the touch. I think it would be safe to assume a battery of that size could never deliver that kind of current even when shorted.

5681256,0,t3_3sx2wx,The main difference I see is that the Pegasus is far less laser cutting a full iv frame versus a few Pegasus mounting plates and parts printing the iv uses a printedpart geared extruder Pegasus uses what appears to be a printedpart direct drive extruder. It should amount to far far less machining time that Colin needs to spend on producing these kits which would allow for a lowercost item. Im not guessing at this either look at the Makerfarm site. The i to iv upgrade kit is  and the i to Pegasus upgrade kit is  so if the Pegasus parts are  cheaper to produce than the iv that the LCD and a small amount of handwaving largely explains the  difference youre seeing.I wouldnt be surprised to see him phase out the iv entirely once he comes out with a  Pegasus and burns through his existing stock of ivspecific parts.So... aside from the LCD get it its only a  addon I think the value of the two printers is comparable while the price of the Pegasus and future longevity of the design is better for the buyer.,3Dprinting,cx1bdjb,2,t5_2rk5q

Youre trying to make me say something Im not and are cherrypicking words and phrases out of context.gt Counterfeiting money is not a victimless crimeNo counterfeiting money and spending it is not victimless. Its the spending part that has victims not the counterfeiting part. But because we assume that anybody willing to go through the process of producing realistic fake money which is not harmful unless you spend it is probably going to to try to spend it which is harmful we just criminalize the harmless act because its far simpler to enforce.gt fraud is not victimlessStrictly speaking fraud can be victimless. For example say I commit tax fraud reporting much higher real income than I actually have such that I end up paying more tax. Nobody is hurt because Im actually paying more tax but this act is still illegal. This is because weve assumed that the only reason that somebody would commit fraud is to steal from others weve simply made all fraud regardless of whether it nets a profit or not illegal.You see what Im saying? Every western society has acts that are illegal even if they dont necessarily hurt anybody simply because the society believes that said acts are extremely strongly associated with harmful activities.gt Criminalizing downloads doesnt preemptively protect anyoneOh come on man. I literally saidgt Im not saying owning these plans should be illegal quite the opposite in fact  Im just saying that the it doesnt hurt anybody why should it be illegal argument is kind of a weak one.I was saying that your argument isnt going to convince anybody other than libertarians.

I got mine almost dialed in for PLA but it was a disaster for PETG due to the greater flexibility and of course you cant print flexible filaments with Bowdens or rather its extremely difficult and nearly impossible D . The advantage youve already identified which was the same reasoning I used. You get less ringing you get higher acceleration and jerk. But it doesnt matter if you cant get the quality you want.Some commercial vendors have solved the problem I hear. Ive seen gorgeous prints from some of them but I dont know how they do it. Ive read every hoot I could find on bow dens and almost got it but not quite. So in order to make sure it was my bowden setup I took my extruder with about mm of tube and ziptied the motor to the carriage for a test. Solved all my problems so now Im working on designing a direct extruder carriage top part.

Ive used it to fix similar model issues many times.Ive seen this kind of thing happen in Blender when you do a Join on Objects instead of a Boolean Union.  The union will remesh the two objects as one and get rid of unnecessary vertices which works well with SimplifyD.  The Join keeps everything from both objects and SimplifyD prints them as such doing their perimeters separately etc.  Even if the two items happen to get connected in the print by their perimeters fusing together I have found it to often be a weak bond that you can snap easily.

If you get a plate thats adequately rated for V youll probably need to recompile the Sailfish firmware on your own to override the bed PWM upper limit thats been set for your printer type.

6197036,0,t1_cyu1133,I tend to agree that D printed products are probably a lot safer than we give them credit for being. Though I would like to err on the side of caution it does seem that in some cases D printed objects can be food safe though Id like some kind of empirical confirmation of this.I also do not trust food safe coating at least not yet. It may be food safe if performed in a laboratory environment but not in a workshop or garage. Particularly if you arent exact in measuring the components there will be unused reagent active in the coating.Id like to get foodsafe prints straight off the printer.Perhaps I can perform the following testProduce a foodsafe single perimeter print. And use a normal foodsafe cup in your cupboard as control.Fill both with warm sugary water breadcrumbs and some dirt. Let them incubate for a few days at room temperature until it has some time to really grow.Then clean them out with hot soap and water the way a normal person would clean any dish.Then after cleaning fill them with RO water.Take a sample of the RO water from each and place in a sterile petri dish with basic nutrients and agar. Let them incubate for a day or two and then count the bacterial colonies.Obviously it would need to be done at a larger scale but this sort of experiment could compare the relative food safety of these PETG prints to what is considered food safe containers,3Dprinting,cyu1c5b,2,t5_2rk5q

With thermoplastic extrusions these can be two very different values due to age of tooling etc. Most manufacturers dont publish either number which makes me question their quality control and the few who do only publish their nominal tolerance.The first tolerance will inform people on if the filament will work with their extruder Some extruders are very picky others are very tolerant.

6733048,0,t3_47up40,My stepsmm for the extruder is done with the hot end removed from the system. I just want to make sure the filament is fed the correct distance without having the pressure from the hot end impact that value. This gives me my baseline that goes into the firmware. The difference between materials is compensated with the extrusion rate in the slicer. Like you I spent lots of time chasing the perfect extrusion multiplier. Using SD as well Id print single wall cubes take  micrometer measurements and average then recalculate the multiplier. Problem is I was seemingly getting ok single wall stuff  but my prints didnt look any better sometimes even worse. I was like ok this feels like bullshit somewhere. Eventually I came across some posts on the Google dprintertiostricksandreviews group talking about SD and extrusion multiplier calibration. I cant remember the details should a saved it...but the gist was that the single wall stuff is pointless for SD due to the way it slices. The best way to tune it is just do the  infill adjust multiplier until it looks perfect calibration. I abandoned my process after that and have been winging it lately but a good data point would be to do the single wall calibration record the number then do the infill method and see if you get the same multiplier.,3Dprinting,d0fr82t,4,t5_2rk5q

I know they have sent out a couple brand new machines due to minor errors. It sounds bad but they offered a  month full warranty and paid shipping for returns. The software they created is still in Alpha but its coming along nicely. The team has been very responsive and has released several versions with fixes based on user input. Theyve also been very active in troubleshooting installation and other connection problems with the backers on their own Flux forum. Ive read several opinions from pretty experienced printer owners that have been really impressed with the outofthebox prints. The modular nature of the toolhead is also really nifty. Honestly I havent even bothered trying out the laser engraver or the drawing tool or the scanning function but Ive seen some good results from others. The scanner is by far the weakest function but Im hopeful some more software tweaks will allow for greater success. Still it prints very well for a machine I backed for ! I do wish it had a heated bed but that would kill the auto bed sensing that it does to calibrate by using pressure sensors under the stainless steel bad. Very cool tech.

Theyll form threads in the aluminum. This should keep your bed from warping under load and keep it in good thermal contact with the bed plate.It should still give you enough clearance for the bed springs to sit flush with the bed.Alternatively you can get a clothing iron from your local p store take it apart and attach the hot assembly to the bed using thermal epoxy.

7186209,0,t1_d1uz5up,It might still be difficult to properly integrate the speakers as the crossover point is a little too high. The reason you want a low crossover for a sub is that at low frequencies its difficult for the human ear to determine the direction of a sound source at low frequencies. This is why you can get away with only ONE subwoofer when you have  or more channels.If the crossover is too high you will begin to notice the high frequencies coming out of the subwoofer wherever you placed it. In addition it will be harder to match the phase of the three speakers higher frequencies have smaller wavelengths so the sweet spot where everything is in phase at the crossover frequency will be smaller.You could of course print two subwoofers and make it a twoway speaker.Your AV receiver? or whatever youre playing needs to be able to adjust the crossover frequency if you want to use the configuration you mentioned. By default its probably set quite low? i dont know.I realize that this is just for fun so dont get to worried about what I said. Just providing a bit of background for you .

A quick test might be to just have nothing plugged into the thermistor connector and see what temp the printer reports. Default is c.

Just that at the very least there were ideals of journalism that were sought and expected by people in the industry and consumers.  Now its just everything goes and its the norm.  The more money it makes the better.Facts DO speak for themselves. Otherwise they would not be facts. To pretend otherwise is to treat the audience like children who are incapable of understanding without guidance.  That has been going on so long its probably true now.  But it wasnt always.Im not complaining about the younger generation. Im complaining about the current state of affairs.  The young always do  things consistently throughout history Rebel from then emulate the older generation when the rebellion thing doesnt get anywhere. Im old enough to have participated in and seen this many times.The problem we have now is everyone from small children to the craziest adults can present their ideas to the world with just as much ease as the largest news organizations.

I believe the heated chamber isnt possible for patent reasons. By fan control I mean the cooling fans for the electronics not nozzle seem to turn on all the time even when the printer isnt active  wish they wouldnt do that.

So that rules out Z wobble as the main cause.It doesnt look to be overly regular so probably not your classic improper layer height zribbing.   Common suspects at that point are the filament lifting your extruder when it goes to pull more off.  Also if youre working with a heated bed variations in temperature like from a heat bed relay can cause an improper build surface to warp and moveup down.With how things usually go its probably a combination of several things though.  If youre running a heated bed see what happens if the lines are still there if you print with it off.  Its a quick easy test. You could even leave the bed on for a bit then turn it off halfway through to help getting it to stick if you need.,3Dprinting,d34i6ja,1,t5_2rk5q

Ive not had an issue getting a WLAN driver to work out of the box with a Linux install since at the latest . Ever done an OEM Windows install from a disc not provided with the computer? Ill bet you the odds are faaaar higher Linux will have the WLAN driver by default than a truly fresh Windows install. Ive  had WLAN work out of the box with a fresh Windows install exactly once. And that doesnt change the fact that I dont have to constantly play games with my OS to keep it from rebooting itself without my consent and changing itself in its entirety. Thats a little more basic than setting up Samba which by the way has several graphical frontends you can easily install from the inbuilt software center. Every easy fix Ive seen with Windows involves running a bunch of arcane commands in obscure prompts as dictated to me by a  year old on a YouTube video that starts with about thirty seconds of screamy pop music played at the volume level of a drive by apocalypse or downloading something from a site that Im pretty sure immediately enrolls my computer in the Russian Federations Electronic Red Army via a crapton of exploits through the doily that is Windows series of terribly patched exploits. Yes I need to run a security system I have one and I only know about the bullshit attempted hijacking because my security system explodes with red alerts not unlike a missile tracking computer if we ever hit DEFCON .To fix things in Linux I use a wiki with articles written by adults or at least people that type like them and then I download a cryptographically signed package thats independently verified to not give my computer cancer and use an installer that checks if any programs have unmet dependencies or will conflict with anything already installed and takes care of that for me. ,3Dprinting,d3gykaq,-2,t5_2rk5q
7702238,0,t1_d3hlnxv,While longstrand fibers are definitely superior its inaccurate to say that the short chopped fibers in filament do not increase strength they do just not nearly as much as longstrand fibers do.

7712565,0,t3_4kxr88,I dont know too much about the moonray I talked to the folks at CES and saw their machine. I asked them why the green shell when everyone else is orange and they said to look different but admitted that it wasnt as effective at blocking UV light. which was kind of a concern But they assured me that it would only be a problem in the long term.As for my opinion on the two there are a lot of things on the form that dont make it in printer comparisons which makes me a little sad. There are a lot more considerations than material cost and print quality on a DLPSLA machine. When it comes to SLADLP I think you need to consider strongly the workflow because of how much more difficult and messy the post cleanup process is.Form is a much more mature machine the workflow is very well thought out and its apparent that the printer is designed around making your life easier. The post cleanup process can be done with only one hand gloved. It comes with ALL the tools you need from gloves to flush cutters to alcohol bath tanks. I cant stress how important post cleanup workflow is to the overall experience of using these machines. I used a low end DLP and the cleanup made you not want to use the printer ever.It looks like the moonray has a similar lack of thinking in terms of post cure.Another big difference is the way the peel mechanism works. Moonray looks like its form style where it tilts the tray. Form now slides to the side and has a wiper that will push away loose or cured bits that would cause print failures. I havent had a failed print with the Form yet which is quite surprising.Lastly you can STILL use rd party resins on the form but you loose the wiper and autofill features if you put it into open mode which is a bit of a bummer.The resin tank is also heated. which is nice. The flexible resin is VERY flexible more so than any ninjaFlex type print from an FDM printer. It feels like silicone.Anyways the Form prints great but its really awesome because of its well thought out workflow. The ease of use and cleanliness will save you and your students in the long run.I agree however that the trays will probably end up costing more in the long run though since you need one per material type.,3Dprinting,d3iv74z,4,t5_2rk5q

7718489,0,t1_d3jit67,No problem stuff happens. Anyway if you want the bed to be totally static its rare you see that outside of delta designs. Typically the bed moves on the Z axis with CoreXY machines just because Im pretty sure moving the whole gantry would be a pretty strenuous process for the motor. The only kind of cartesian machine I can think of right now where all of the movement is done on the axes is a design by Printrbot meant to make an effectively infinitely extendable monstrous printer called the Big E so perhaps you could look to that for inspiration?As for your electronics Id say start with a basic RAMPS board. I bought this recently and it seems solid. I cant vouch for its quality yet as Ive yet to actually use it. Given the sheer size of a machine you want to build Id think you might want to look into NEMAs though and those require a beefier board so Im not sure where youd begin to look for something like that.

7743631,0,t1_d3lnjcu,Thanks for the reply. When I disconnect the heatbed thermistor it stays at  deg C and if I heat up the heatbed it registers the correct temperature when hot. If I connect the board to repetier and say for a split second short out the pins on the extruder temp terminals it does register something like  deg C on repetier so thats how I know it works kinda the more volts through the higher the temp. Tested the terminals with a multimeter and it shows that its outputting something like .v whereas the terminals for the heatbed sensor is outputting v. Not sure if this is right for Melzi boards.Ive purchased a replacement board in the meanwhile but really annoying that this happened. Is there a firmware fix that would temporarily set the  temp to  deg ie bring everything down to match whatevers going on as a workaround?EDIT Just to add on as well it was working fine the night before. Literally had something printing a few hours before it happened and things were going well.

7950057,0,t3_4o3zoz,I really like the MKS boards specifically the GEN .. The GEN and BASE are both good the biggest difference is that BASE has integrated drivers while GEN has external replaceable drivers. I like running Silentstepsticks so I obviously prefer the GEN. They both also use JST connectors instead of Dupont which means that the cables tend to be more secure and do not come loose or disconnected from vibration. This is the one I prefer its a GEN . even though the discription claims it is BASE ..  Considering they are usually  shipped from China its a great deal. ,3Dprinting,d49ntwi,2,t5_2rk5q

Ive never met someone in the plastics industry that did not know the hazards of ABS.  You dont even have a printer yet you came into a subreddit window shopping for your first time because you think d printers are cool and got triggered when people didnt have the patience to doll out brain dead obvious links to studies that my  year old grandmother could find on google in a matter of ten seconds between typing reading the headers then selecting and clicking on one.  When you appear to be too lazy or arrogant just to be so...people arent going to give a fuck about you or helping you like me.Theres a very big difference between shifting the burden of proof and not wasting time trying to find links on my phone to cater to a halfwit that has severe issues with being stubborncant let things go even when they are wrong or cant figure out whether theyre wrong or right.  Youre one of those little cunt millenials that think the world needs to answer and cater to you.  You dont care to see for yourself everything has to be present to you everything has to be sugar coated and helpful lazy playing devils advocate just to be a troll etc.  People are willing to help on here until some  year old comes in starts an argument whilst being clueless to d printing and demands proof of something he is ignorant to something that could be found with a google search within seconds and something that everyone and there brother knows about in the d printing world.  Tens of millions of people are part of the plastic manufacturing industry and you sit there like a little snot nose amoeba demanding information be delivered to you so you dont have to type with your limp fish hands and find something on your own.This is not a subreddit filled with children.  Were generally all adults here considering the price of a printer.  Dont be surprised that someone shuns you off because dont care to search for something obvious. If you werent such a trivial strawman argument out of context extrodinaer then I very well may have written you a road map to google.com and told to type in the subject matter of which were speaking on given that youve demonstrated you are not capable of such things.If youre going to act like a baby people are going to talk to you and put you down like a baby.shrugsEnjoy the weekend ,3Dprinting,d4d7fff,1,t5_2rk5q

8266635,0,t3_4snqb6,Solidworks is NURBS STL is polygons. There has been this division since computer graphics started there are CAD D programs with nurbs and then there are Art D programs with polygons. Nurbs live in their own world so they have to be exported as polygons for STL. Art D programs like DMax and Maya have their own pseudonurbs within their environment but output is polygons. That is where the rub is the conversion and inputoutput. CAD programs always use a STL exporter and they output crazy huge files with a whole bunch of shells. STL import is kind of hitormiss. RhinoD is probably the only one that can work with both well has a steep learning curve. Blender is an Art D software but it is getting huge community support for converters and format support as well as more D mesh repair.  The other limitation of STL is that it only has one surface.  It is an interesting phase STL is very robust but not suitable for editing and the concern now in D printing moving forward is DRM. Gcode is a carryover from CNC machines. D printers starting to be able to use IGS will address these limitations and allow for more DRM. As long as STL stays the standard D printer format it provides its own copy protection since it is difficult to edit.  ,3Dprinting,d5avxtw,1,t5_2rk5q

If so then in addition to figuring out the other problems you probably want to look at the hobbed bolt and see if there is any filament blocking the teeth on it. This is important as if it gets gunked up it has a much harder time pushing filament due to less grip. You may also be served by doing some cold pulls and see if there are any blockages in the nozzle. Id run them with ABS since it runs hotter.

As for reviewers I have yet to see one from Tom or the d printing nerd so me personally one of the support guys who btw never saw this complaint come through so Im not sure who said user error I would wait. Sure I have an OLD ass i that has seen some better days but thats the price I paid to be a first adopter of it.

8428024,0,t1_d5umh6c,Its pretty arrogant to dismiss advances into consumer level software having new features just because professionals have had access for it for years only for thousands of dollars per license. This consistently happens in the tech industry where professional grade software gets democratized to the consumers and the advancements in consumer tech gets dismissed until they come up with new techniques that outstrip their professional counterparts. Its the same thing in D rendering and VR.I am sure some movie studio in s was laughing at the excitement of quake and its graphics and what they were doing wasnt real lighting and the fact that the studios were working on stuff that was  years in the future. Right up until Carmack developed a computer science technique that would be worthy of any PHD dissertation.Fast inverse square root didnt happen in some professional graphics studio because there was no motivation to make anything work faster or better when you could throw several thousand dollars and the problem and get the result.Have you used D printing software from professional D system machines or Stratysis before consumer d Printing? The interface is usually garbage and the tool path generation was mediocre. Many professional CAM interfaces like MACH  looked like they came from the s and havent changed because there was no interest in making it anymore user friendly instead of telling to company engineer to just deal with it we are paying you Now D printing and CAM software is cheaper and far easier to use than any of their professional counter parts. Cura is a million times easier to understand than that  Invision d printer I used.

8466018,0,t1_d5y35l8,Quick tip the strength of the hook would be much higher if the part had a uniform width and was able to be printed on its side. Or maybe youve already considered this and decided it was unnecessary.That would probably increase the overall strength of the part however I tested the current design to lbs on my hanging scale with it bolted into a rafter and it had no trouble holding it. The part tested was printed with supports out of Hatchbox ABS  infill. I cant imagine needing it to retain more force than that to hold a bungee cord in place on a load. Ive got my printer dialed in well enough that Ive never run into layer separation issues while it might be less than ideal to have the layers run perpendicular to the force being applied I dont think it will be an issue with this part. The design was the result of trying to keep rounded edges and make it blend with the interior of my car without making it look too out of place. Ive printed the part both with and without supports and ended up with an almost identical result both times it prints flat on its back just fine on both my Flashforge and my Kossel Mini. My settings for printing without supports is  infill mm offset  layer brim  cooling fan at layer  and above.

8554719,0,t3_4ww2vr,Wanhao Duplicator i. You get a decent printer out of the box. You can then do some relatively simple mechanical upgrades to make it a GREAT printer. Throw on the zaxis braces and it can produce prints equal to or better than printers twice the price.It will print ABS PETG etc. just fine although for ABS you may want to consider building an enclosure for it. Again with the time youd save building from a kit you can easily build a basic enclosure at the same time.The other reason I recommend the Duplicator i is that theres a huge community of people using it so you have a big knowledge base to draw upon if you run into any problems.Its been rebadged by a few places  HobbyKing Monoprice etc. but Wanhao is the Chinese manufacturer that builds them.,3Dprinting,d6awxds,0,t5_2rk5q

8811413,0,t1_d76xp3p,Well as a matter of fact I have. Like mentioned in another comment here my multimeter said there were about . ohms between the vGND pads. So  volts on the v terminal would be according to the well known formulas about  watts. My guts say thats alright.  Everythings looking fine so far. The only part that kinda worries me is the relay because its getting pretty warm yet not so hot that I cant touch it anymore. But I think it gets warm because its coil is driven with  volts instead of  volts as specified. Relays in a car power network usually get around   . volts. So the relay should be able to take the  volts. It might be that at some point the pallet of the relay might die. Worst case it melts shut and cant open again leading to a thermal runaway. So before this might happen I think itll be a good idea to check if all the parts can handle a possible thermal runaway of the heat bed by just gradually increasing the temperature until it wont go any higher and carefully examining what happens... worst case scenario in such a controlled environment Im gonna need a few new parts. ,3Dprinting,d770g5c,1,t5_2rk5q

As a backup given an extreme failure you should place your automated system over the printer on the ceiling or something and keep the printer away from all flammable items. Attach a fan that vents to a window outside to your enclosure and make the enclosure mostly airtight.For clearing the bed... Many have tried many have failed.

9434615,0,t3_59v2mi,I recommend these calipers They arent the cheapest option but arent that expensive. I like them because the absolute zero function means you dont have to zero them each time you use them. Apart from that they are probably not more accurate than options in the  range. So inexpensive options like the Neiko brand on Amazon are more than suitable for D printing.    Since there are several comments regarding tape and glue for bed adhesion I highly recommend making an upgrade to your printer and adding a sheet of PEI with M transfer tape I got mine from CS Hyde since the adhesive is already attached. You will not need to use anything else going forward to get prints to stick when using common filaments like ABS and PLA. I almost never see complaints about prints not sticking after switching to PEI.,3Dprinting,d9bwiuf,2,t5_2rk5q

9491793,0,t1_d9iylyo,Honestly sanding a FDM print is a pain in the ass and doesnt work if you have any complicated or interior surfaces that need to be smooth. It can definitely help but you need several passes to get that smooth finish required for proper movement. Theres also the issue of support material to consider. Unless youre designing your print specifically for FDM you will need to print it with supports and removing those can be a pain in the ass too. However Ive heard great things about SimplifyDs support material so that may not be an issue if youre willing to buy that software . You can definitely prototype more and cheaper parts with a FDM I grant you that. However again it simply cant compete when it comes to smooth surfaces and precision. I dont fully understand what types of files youre going to be printing or if youll be designing them yourself so I cant comment further. But I can guarantee you that as someone who loves FDM and has used it for years youre going to have a harder time with it than with SLA if you need parts to fit together precisely. One thing you might consider doing is buying a cheap but competent FDM printer such as the maker select to prototype and a SLA printer for the finished parts. EDIT For what its worth a lot of the extra FDM materials are mostly gimmicky. You can get filaments that have stone bits or wood bits inside them but it does not appreciably change a materials strength or the fact that its mostly plastic in the end. ,3Dprinting,d9j2ehv,1,t5_2rk5q

9594191,0,t1_d9uy5y3,Its not a software issue at all.  Its a physical problem with the leadscrewsbearings.  It doesnt matter if its metric or imperial.  If you can adjust the steps per mm in the firmware youll be able to get accurate heights regardless of the type.  Heres what I think is happening.  The typical mounting system for that printer by looking at it has just one nut on the leadscrew with plastic bearings on the rods.  I think that something has happened with the bearings to where there is enough play in them to allow for the zwobble you are seeing.  If the Z axis is bent enough youll get this problem even if you print out an antibacklash thing or even another nut with a brace on the bottom.  It could also be one of the rods for the bearings is loose somehow.  If you can take the leadscrew out and roll it on a surface that you know is completely flat.  if there are any gaps or wavers anywhere then this is the problem.  If its straight then youre looking at possible bearing issues or loose rods.  Best of luck!  ,3Dprinting,d9voi5m,1,t5_2rk5q

9699446,0,t1_da8mzyp,Ahhh. A lot of people say level when they mean flat. I got cross lines with what you actually meant.The only two things i would moan about with the Wilson  as standard are the belt tensioners are pretty poor but work. They seem to wobble and create slight backlash. But the guy that printed my parts made a pretty bad job of them imo. And the other is the YMotor holder brace. When i tension my belt the motor angles in from the force of the belt pulling. Again this may well be the print quality of my part. But im having to wedge my motor underneath until i remake the part. Possible redesign. This is causing backlashringing too as the belt hits and clicks on the top of the idler and the pulley. Not really aligned very well. ,3Dprinting,da8nw82,1,t5_2rk5q

You wont need to back it off much definitely no more than .mm but thats the solution.If it seems like its too far after moving it only slightly then you likely have a different issue your bed is not truly level or worse has a bendpits in it that makes certain parts higher than others.

10137710,0,t1_dbsx6fw,I dont believe you.Either youre only printing very near the center andor you dont print  often enough to notice or youre just lying.Especially with a bed as large as the MM that reciprocates I can  guarantee that the edges of the bed drift out of level by at least .mm every  hours of printing or so. You might not notice it at the center and you get a lot of forgiveness for being out of level due to the bed being so large but theres no physical way that printer keeps  level at the extremes of its print volume indefinitely. Its just not physically possible.Not only does the bed go out of level itself but all the effector hardware gantry screws bearings mounting hardware etc. shifts around by microns too eventually leading to zheight errors over time if you dont relevel.I call total bullshit on you and your claims. ,3Dprinting,dbsy4or,-4,t5_2rk5q

10192451,0,t3_5lwv7x,I have had a similar problem for quite a while on my self built printer with ghetto arrangement of bowden extruder. The main reason for this is skipped extrusion when the extruder does not provide uniform flow of plastic. This could happen mainly if you have a partially clogged nozzle or if your extruder motor skips steps filament slips off of the extruder gear or there is problem pulling filament from spool maybe bad winding of filament or bad positioning of the spool so filament wont be easily pulled by the motor. If this started to happen all of a sudden without you doing anything to the printer my best guess would be a partial clog. But if this started to happen after you tried rearranging or made differnce in settings...it may be either of the other problems.And your prints are brittle because of the same reason that there is not uniform flow of filament hence causing random layer gaps and I could be sure that your prints break at such layers. And to your other query I believe humidity wont cause this type of issue. Finally discovery requires  experimentation. So try printing same model again with different filament and see if the same problem happens again and at same places or not. If humidity is the issue the other filament may not give you the same result.,3Dprinting,dbzdcsc,1,t5_2rk5q

10201142,0,t1_dc07vcc,No because materials are only peinterspecific if they are prorietary in which case you are locked into buying that filament anyway.General d printing materials fall into  main categories .mm and mm .mm. If your printer accepts .mm filament standard you can use almost any .mm material.The only reasons you CANT use some . would be the following examples ultempei polycarbonate and some other materials may require a higher temperature than your hotend is rated for. ninjaflex semilengthy meltout or wax filaments may be too soft for your extruder design. These materials require a maximally constrained path of travel between the extruder and hotend and often will not work when a Bowden tube is used to constrain the filament between the extruder and the seperate hotend.,3Dprinting,dc0cub4,3,t5_2rk5q

10223151,0,t1_dc1qsem,The hot end does get hotter than the bed but typically the bed will draw more current. A common failure and potential source of ignition is poor connections for the bed wiring which melt and fail with too much current. Be sure all bed wiring is very secure at each connector and maybe once a month turn the printer off and snug up each wire connector due to vibrations. Dont go crazy and crush each connector just make them nice and snug and make sure all the strands of a wire make it into the connector and none get nicked when stripped. Tinning the stripped ends with solder or using ring crimp terminals can be helpful.,3Dprinting,dc2unhm,1,t5_2rk5q

10542408,0,t3_5qygh7,I think I see your reasoning so let me try and open your wallet up a bit.    Look at the Ultibots DVS      . All metal frame.    . simple design.    . Duet wifi controller board    This thing is a huge selling point for me. I was a hair away from getting a Seemecnc Rostock max v. Then I learn about the DVS. It has wifi no sd cards needed no PI needed auto calibration fantastic drivers accurate and allows for near silent motors  Coming with the Duet board stock is a huge upgrade.  Web interface just dial into it using any phonetabletlaptop and put it to work.          . it has the most popular hotend on the market.   . fast and huge print area.    . auto calibrating.       . Free shipping in the usa.              Heres my logic youre buying pretty much a fully decked out printer from the start no need to replaceupgrade anything meaning no wasting money. Like the V I mentioned same price as the Dvs but everything had plenty of room for upgrade making most of the parts obsoletea waste of money.    Plus upgrading sounds like a pain having to tweek and reconfigure things just about every time you change something.    So yeah i just orderd mine and itll be here in a few days. Its twice what I planed to spend but should save my wallet in the long run.    If you have any questions Ill try and answer em     PS. If that is just too out of budget get a makerfarm.  ,3Dprinting,dd33lck,4,t5_2rk5q

That doesnt mean it isnt impossible for there to be moisture in your filament but that would be something that happened during production rather than after you opened it.The easiest way to check if it is your filament is to jog some filament through the nozzle using the control box and if you see it bubble or hear it hiss or pop there is moisture in the filament.,3Dprinting,dd5n5kt,5,t5_2rk5q
10565684,0,t3_5rarjw,A few of the things got broken in transit the spike and the rightmost two wall thickness testers.

Theres also a little bit of a gap on some things the cup near the hex nut hole near the gap width test.I was surprised that the  bridge has some splitting but the  doesnt. This was incredibly interesting. I thought the printer would chew this up without supports but I found out that everything printed alright without it. Granted this is small but it was still pretty cool to see it done well.My first layer still leaves a lot to be desired the lines are very visible and it and theres some definite loss of resolution on there.

10649623,0,t3_5scaf9,I think the solution will be to heat up the nozzle as usual maybe a bit hotter then with a new filament cut the end so its flat not a sharp point like when loading it fresh then push that through the hole so it pushes against the bit of filament sticking out and the extruder motor should push the new filament into that one as if it was the same filament. This is how I used to loadchange colours on my Flashforge Finder due to the loadingunloading never working properly. If you can trip and snip that little bit sticking out so that it has a flatter end so the new filament has something better to push against. ,3Dprinting,ddefd3n,3,t5_2rk5q

To verify your hotend temperature a thermometer or infrared camera can be used on the hotend. The thermoresistor should be accurate to C. Also check that there is no damage to the thermoresistor wires. But yeah most likely filament. ,3Dprinting,ddwwhh0,1,t5_2rk5q

Plugging a fan into the thermistor inputs shouldnt have any long term effects unless the circuit they are using is really really strange unlikely.

10865578,0,t1_de0m1sn,Ok I just read your other post.Flash print from Flashforge website will update the firmware if it is needed.That printer does not use gcode so you will have to make sure when preparing a print it is in the correct format. I think the correct is like .gp or something like thatnot sure.I have the Creator Pro and I love this printer. It is my first printer and I would guess it would list some time.I am not sure how yours works but mine has a SD card where you can either put the files on and print from by selecting print from SD option and selecting the correct print. Or using a USB cable to your computer and having a slicer that can export the correct format and can detect the printer.I use SimplifyD but I have to use a special plugin that allows for the export of that special file format.

How I would approach this is get a very tightly woven wire mesh and outline his dome then fill that portion with dirt then water it down so it cakes in nice and tight add more dirt if needed but leaving enough breathing room for seeds to grow. Then once you have his dome molded out in dirt put the base on and flip him remove the dome and slowly take off the mesh. Put the dome back on and youll be ready to plant seeds through the holes in his back  ,3Dprinting,deppnri,1,t5_2rk5q

On the second model all tweaks appeared using the exact same layer numbers as before.

11357423,0,t1_dfdl1f3,I cant easily get rid of my bowden setup.FWIW I have done some further experiments and I concluded that Hatchbox PETG just needs VERY high temperatures. It simply doesnt flow well at lower temperatures. Hatchbox actually recommend  C which is quite high for PETG. So with  C I was at the very bottom of the recommended range.If I push my hotend to the PTFE limit of  C with the speed reduced slighly more I can get mostly rid of the blobbing. So I suppose for Hatchbox PETG you probably actually need a full metal hotend. There are other PETGs on the market which supposedly need less temperature so I will give these a try. For instance dasfilament.de PETG has a recommended range of  C.,3Dprinting,dfjcd06,1,t5_2rk5q

Believe me youll have plenty to learn without fixing your machine.Do yourself a favor save up just a bit more and get an assembled machine MP Select Mini V comming soon look out for that AKA Malyan M Flashforge Finder or a Monoprice Maker Ultimate. If you think about it those hours youll spend assembling your kit printer and upgrading it converted to money will make them the same as the readytogo ones. At the very least get a semiassembled machine like a Wanhao i Plus AKA Monoprice Maker Select Plus but make sure to check if the bed is insulated from the metal springs and also read up about the MOSFET upgrades.If you however insist on a kit for the learning experience  fun  challange  then get something with a DC power brick for a power supply like  .I got a very similar kit Afinibot CR  Freaks D mini two years ago back when there was no MP Select Mini. The assembly went smooth and overall it is a good machine and I love the Vslot extrusion motion so much better than the linear bearings but it was printing so bad at first. I immediately had to replace one Vwheel and a pulley because they were defective and within two months I replaced two extruder assemblies feeder gear PTFE tube zscrew coupler and a few mounting parts. Would I buy my kit again? No Id rather buy the MP Select Mini  Malyan M. Would I buy the Tronxy kit? Considering the price  maybe but I dont like the controller box and my version is almost all metal whereas Tronxy is held by acrylic.P.S.

11433322,0,t1_dfrw54w,If all you need is a photo to copy something then it probably wasnt worthy of patent protection.  I say probably because most things these days are obvious or trivial modifications to something that has existed for a long time but every once in a great while something truly innovative that seems obvious in hindsight comes along that does deserve patent protection.So thats patent what about copyright?  Well if its something like an artistic work e.g. a characterfaceorganiclooking thing then you can claim to own the copyright to thatno matter how its printed.  However when it comes to things that just serve a general purpose like say a clamp you dont really have any ground to stand on when it comes to copyright.The reason why you cant copyright something like a clamp or a screw mount for somethingorother is because theyre not copyrightable subject matter.  You could copyright a paper towel roll holder that had a fancy decoration but you couldnt copyright the concept of a paper towel roll holder because theres an infinite number of ways to make one.One cannot make say a gear bearing of a specified sizeteeth and claim that all other gear bearings of that size or that many teeth are derivative works because its not a creative work.  You could organize a bunch of gears into an interesting display and claim a copyright on that however!A simple test to determine the copyrightability of any given thing assuming reconstruction from photos Is there something creative or artsy here? Is it a functional part that couldnt have been created by just about anyone with sufficient skill trying to solve the same problem?If you answer no to the above then its probably not copyrightable.Note This is not legal advice and I am not a lawyer.  Whats copyrightable or not ultimately comes down to a judge or jurys decision and getting to that point is an extremely time consuming and expensive affair.  So if youre making plans for that sort of situation youd better be prepared for all that trouble!,3Dprinting,dfryeli,3,t5_2rk5q

We also use it for quick prototyping and it is excellent for that as well. One of the main benefits of SLA over FDM prints is that the resulting SLA print is essentially homogenous so the print orientation doesnt add any weakness along the layer lines.The resin is pretty expensive though and the resin trays are consumable too so the costs add up pretty quick.

You dont need to store it in a special way however depending on where you live it will become more brittle and if it becomes too brittle you will have to cook it in the oven though personally Ive never had to resort to that. ,3Dprinting,dfw1sc7,1,t5_2rk5q

Doesnt need an enclosure  and is very rigid with the right amount of infill.  Also is very similar to ABS in resistance to heat.  Just be very careful  it likes to really stick to a heated bed.

Ive even run polycarbonate  degree C print temp and switched to PLA  degree C print temp and left it at the higher temperature. Theres no smoke or anything worrisome about that. You need to get up to  or  degrees C before thats a worry. Most of the time fire risks are there when a printer has been improperly designed or manufactured on the electrical board side. Any good electrical board will handle the currents involved without any significant increase in temperatures of the circuit boards and will handle a short should these wires loose their insulation and cross by having a fuse that blows and stops and current from flowing.,3Dprinting,dfzh07w,2,t5_2rk5q

11543361,0,t3_64rj6c,I choose infill based on a few different factors.. Does it need to be strong? If not  is usually plenty to give some rigidity. If you want a nice solid feeling for something like a figurine youre better off using more shells than increasing the infill. . Size and shape of the object. Sometimes depending on the shape of the object a certain  of infill will cause issues near the walls or will produce lines that your printer is going to have trouble with. In these cases I increase or decrease the infill by  or  until the infill pattern flows well with the structure of the object.For something small like a thumbscrew cover Id not want to go too high on the infill or you may as well just make it solid.  might be enough. For the fidget spinner wall strength is important since you need to snap the bearings in. The recommendation is  walls an  infill so that you are less likely to break it when inserting the bearings. Again Im pretty sure the walls are more important in this case than the infill .,3Dprinting,dg4fwoy,2,t5_2rk5q

Marlin is in source control if you got it with git clone anyway so you can probably commit now and get a full change summary from before you input any changes. That will let you check them one by one to find which might have caused it. You could also diff just the configuration.h file from your original download against your current one with no git foolery to get the same result quickly.Yesterday while tuning my stepsmm I accidentally input a q character infront of an ifdef which caused it to fail to compile.

Equally if I wanted a massively huge print SLA just isnt the way to go but rather a Ultimaker . mm nozzle or the Wasp with the  mm nozzle. So really the comparison is what are you planning on printing with your printer? And really you need both.

11690647,0,t1_dgl4r23,Yeah thats the material I was talking about although I do not recommend Hatchbox PETG. It prints much weaker than other brands.  spool of PETG is kg of material or  meters at .mm.This equates to about cm per kg. Most hobbyist printers run at a  failure rate and commercial ones at  so well split the difference and say about . That leaves us with cm of material per kg.If you have a hollow sphere of mm OR mm IR that gives you a volume of . cm per item. You can also assume you may need another cm max for things like support and rafts or brims. So you have cm to work with and each part is cm so that gives you  items per spool. That math works out for our hub at least. We and a few others work out to a x markup on materials. Some hubs based on the printers and materials used as well as time and labor can go up to x materials. ,3Dprinting,dgl5idx,3,t5_2rk5q

11699717,0,t3_66y12k,Overextrusion?  It can cause the messy layers because they get squished out rather than laminating on and buildup on the nozzle causes blisters and grossness.  When it gets bad enough it can hit the nozzle and cause lost steps accompanied by loud unpleasant clacking.  If you have a micrometer or even a ruler hell print one you can try calibrating your extruder. The vibration appearance can be caused by the layers going all over the place and lowering the temperaturespeed can make it extrude slower and hide some issues by spreading the layer out more.  You could try something like thisIm still struggling to control the stringing on my PETG spool but I had problems kind of like yours which turned out to be underextrusion... I think the track it was laying was thinning out and eventually getting overpowered by the stickiness of the PETG which would form a big glob.  That led to really weird extrusion variations that embiggened small features so they hit the nozzle so I thought I was overextruding.  I kept lowering the extrusion and making it worse and worse until the diagonal underextrusion lines appeared.,3Dprinting,dgm6jps,2,t5_2rk5q

My guess is its pretty much a wash.Either way your Z axis is doing much less work than your X and Y axes so you can simply turn down the current on the driver and go on your merry way.  watts is  watts whether its being dissipated in one or three locations.

11756475,0,t3_67r92g,If you want to build a better machine definitely get the Mini. In fact the v dropped today. It has a few improvements including support for WLAN connected printing. To make a better printer all you want is a solid reliable workhorse that can make parts reliably and thats the Mini to a T.If you want a project that kinda works the A is well its okayish. Youre not going to learn how a printer works with the A youre going to learn about the corners a cheap factory cuts and how to repair them. The majority of fixes for the A are things that compensate for issues that havent existed with most printers for at least two or three years. Youre not learning a whole hell of a lot about a printer that you wouldnt learn selfsourcing a printer and in fact you can end up learning a number of the wrong lessons like using a drill to fix a nozzle or warped smooth rod bearing having to install relays to fix current issues reflashing a firmware to give the machine the basic ability to figure out if its on fire and shut down because of this and lots more that not only wont be useful on another machine but that in some cases could be damaging to your machine if you were to use them.EDIT disclaimer as I talked about the A Im going to have negative karma because theres a user that actively brigades me and downvotes any criticism I make of the A due to him being totally unable to stand criticism.

If the motors are off you could manually move the head along the x axis to any point and send G X and the printer will think that it is  mm away from the zero point on the x axis.
