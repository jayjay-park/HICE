Albert Lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance though likely taken at more than one sitting. Tolkien believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of AngloSaxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the Christianization of England around AD  and Tolkien s conviction that the poem dates to the th century has been defended by Tom Shippey among others. The claim to an thcentury date is due in part to scholars who argue that rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk Beowulf reflects an original interpretation of the story by the manuscript s two scribes.Tales concerning the Skjldungs possibly originating as early as the th century were later used as a narrative basis in such texts as Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus and Hrlfs saga kraka. Some scholars see Beowulf as a product of these early tales along with Gesta Danorum and Hrlfs saga kraka and some early scholars of the poem proposed that the latter saga and Beowulf share a common legendary ancestry Beowulf s Hrothulf being identified with Hrlf Kraki ancestry. Paul Beekman Taylor argued that the Ynglingasaga was proof that the Beowulf poet was likewise working from Germanic tradition. Friedrich Panzer attempted to contextualise Beowulf and other Scandinavian works including Grettis saga under the international folktale type B or The Bear s Son tale. However although this folkloristic approach was seen as a step in the right direction The Bear s Son tale was seen as too universal.Works related to Beowulf at Wikisource Quotations related to Beowulf at Wikiquote Full digital facsimile of the manuscript on the British Library s Digitised Manuscripts website Beowulf manuscript in The British Library s Online Gallery with short summary and podcast Annotated List of Beowulf Translations The List  Arizonal Center for Medieval and Renaissance StudiesFortunately most students encountering Beowulf read it in a form translated into modern English. Still a familiarity with the rudiments of AngloSaxon poetry enables a deeper understanding of the Beowulf text. Old English poetry is highly formal but its form is quite unlike anything in modern English. Each line of Old English poetry is divided into two halves separated by a caesura or pause and is often represented by a gap on the page as the following example demonstrates Because AngloSaxon poetry existed in oral tradition long before it was written down the verse form contains complicated rules for alliteration designed to help scops or poets remember the many thousands of lines they were required to know by heart.If at all possible list at least one actual author or editor for a book instead of using Unknown. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English such as thorn  and eth  representing both pronunciations of modern English th  as in thing and this  are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions.
