EU SILC  digits PAIRFAM contains ISCO not sure anymore about the number of digits. SOEP does also Im pretty sure but never looked at that data.

You can also get some of the same data from GIS servers and you can use QGIS to create maps if you dont have access to ArcGIS.I didnt look in detail but you could reproduce your examples with some djsMix that in with census data by county or zip code locational twitter data etc... and you can do a lot of interesting map visualizations.,datasets,cve8sc5,1,t5_2r97t

If you did have a dataset its unlikely to be reliable.

7691141,0,t1_d3gez96,gtI am really leaning towards PCA to make sure all of my predictors arent shitPCA wont improve your predictors it just means there will be less of it. If anything PCA makes you lose out information even it is just  . The improvement it provides is if you have too many variables for the number of observations you have. But if your original predictors suck the extracted components will suck too.gtSuper secret technique is to go to lolking go to their leader board section and right click inspect go to network refresh the page and youll see that the summoner ids are loaded in via a json object. It might be worth considering whether it isnt possible to crawllolking unless youre already doing this.gtA potential application is that it lets me find relationships between the summoners aggregate stats and current tier  rank as well as compare their champion specific stats to champion mastery score to the aggregate stats specific to the champion and correlate in game behavior to mastery score withIn the end are you buildng a model over matches which includes both match level characteristics and summoner level characteristics or are you building a model on a summoner level?,datasets,d3gflzn,2,t5_2r97t
