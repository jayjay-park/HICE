7390402,0,t3_4geqiz,Is you approach a better presentation of existing public data? If so would it be possible to establish a kind of Wikipedia of financial statements whereby interested parties could translate existing forms of data into your new Simpel presentation?That is couldnt this be done permissionlessly for any organization that already releases its data to the public?Of course I imagine such information would need to be more carefully cultivated than Wikipedia perhaps it should be treated more like the opensource code of a computer program whereby a modification makes its way up through some organicallydefined hierarchy of expertise before becoming visible to official channels of distribution.In the parlance of git an interested investor or someone he pays could send a pull request to the maintainer of the Simpel presentation for a particular organization and that maintainer could send a pull request to the maintainer of the umbrella project for all organizations etc. Cryptographic signatures could be used along the way to certify authenticity of the reviewsand thereby also allow for the inclusion of certification by some agency of experts in the Simpel Accounting method.,Sunlight,d2i8l9d,1,t5_2rx82
