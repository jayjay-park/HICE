4510435,0,t1_csz5aj1,I have a friend who mains Harute and thinks its the bees knees. He is the best player in our group but he can use the missiles and scissor bits damned effectively.,GundamExVs,csz6sr6,1,t5_35b2p
4675588,0,t1_ctjw9z0,Sorry. I wasnt trying to explain how PSN works with EXVS because frankly I dont use it Even though that is the question. I play LAN so I felt like sharing how great localplay can be. My example does seem rushed and rather poor in hindsight though thats my bad.The two times Ive tried online play from west Canada the lag was horrible. Thats why I mentioned the whole lag thing. I imagine if the OP went to Otakon which is in Baltimore his lag to Japan would be even worse than mine which is why I tried to write something convincing to show how fun LAN is. ,GundamExVs,ctjwozl,1,t5_35b2p

7150669,0,t3_3yf8l9,To me it feels like they were putting toes in the water like they did with the PS game Gundam Crossfireand although it wasnt TERRIBLE you could tell that they werent really hinging on the games success overseaswith titles like Gundam Musou that can be easily delevoped.HellGundam Musou Reborn overall has less content AND no English VAsbut was shrouded away as digitalonly title. AAt least GB is getting those English Subs...right?,GundamExVs,d1qyj9e,1,t5_35b2p
