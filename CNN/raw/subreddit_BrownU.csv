195303,0,t3_1wcfvq,What are you interested in? Brown has a ton of clubs and organizations that cater to basically every hobby and personality type.But I seriously cant overstate the value of joining some kind of club even a really casual one. My freshman year I was one of like  people in the anime club and now as a senior Im president of a completely different organization and I have a huge social network. Im not even an especially social person.Seriously join a club. List interests and maybe someone can recommend a few.,BrownU,cf0opsf,10,t5_2sbc1

1645955,0,t3_2d699m,If you have computer skills you might consider applying to be a consultant at the Service Center description here The pay is pretty good and the job is very manageable though how busy you are at work fluctuates a bit with the time of year registration etc. lead to much busier shifts. Youll have to deal with your friends asking you for computer help but theres also free candy and cake on occasion. They dont look for any previous work experience but instead ask you about the skills you have if you can remove virusesmalware and know how to get into Safe Mode youre probably qualified. Most of the Brownspecific stuff which is most of what we get questions about you learn on the job.,BrownU,cjmmx0g,2,t5_2sbc1

5532899,0,t3_3qt6dy,I know nothing about the music department so I echo breads  asking them is your best course of action.If its not appropriate as a supplement Id still totally discuss this in your app  sounds like a great essay topic if you can make it fit not sure what the essay constraints are these days. Anything that a you spend a lot of time on and b produces a tangible result is something admissions would want to see. It shows drive dedication and followthrough which cant always come through just based on transcripts and test scores.Any chance you can post a song here?,BrownU,cwivk11,1,t5_2sbc1
7185336,0,t3_4d6hau,Lower level classes are terrible so dont take them. Also dont listen to what people say who have only taken those low level classes.Higher level classes are good especially if you choose the right professors.You would probably just want to take a lot of algebranumber theory and theoretical classes offered by the CS department. Those are all good here.,BrownU,d1uws09,2,t5_2sbc1
7371951,0,t3_4gb7gb,I was also initially rejected from Brown but I got accepted when I applied to transfer two years later. I did manage to maintain a high gpa which I think really helped. I did not have many ECs really only ultimate frisbee so I cant say if that will help you much. I didnt apply for financial aid though which may have been the clincher for me. I will note that I was accepted for winter semester which meant I had a semester where I basically couldnt go to school because they wouldnt accept any more transfer credits. It turned out well for me though and I had no troubles or qualms with graduating a semester behind my original graduation date. This was  years ago. Really my only tip is to keep your gpa high but I hope my story helps give you an idea of what could happen. Past that I do believe it comes down to a random decision at the end so keep your fingers crossed! I wish you the best of luck. ,BrownU,d2g51q4,2,t5_2sbc1
8019540,0,t3_4oz747,I also loved it. They intentionally make the groups be people you dont know they ask you to list where you lived and who you know doing BOLT so its a great way to meet new people. The hiking was fun without being too strenuous and you learn some cool hiking tricks that stayed with me. Highly recommend ,BrownU,d4hgz72,2,t5_2sbc1
8895009,1,t1_d7h0hlg,I dont think your heart is in the right place and you are definitely misguided.  First of all there is a distinction to be made between advocating and agreeingacknowledging.  I do not advocate publicly for tampons in public restrooms but I do agree publicly that they are good idea if the trade off is worth it.  Implementing solutions with idealism versus pragmatism leads to problems and inefficiencies.  There is always a trade off to be made.  If there are extra tampons to go around they should be distributed in the most efficient manner possible  they havent brought to the table a discussion of a real issue they have brought to the table a distraction from real issues.  You are making way too many assumptions about how I personally feel about this  I have no personal bother or concern here only a concern for principle.  And the principle of the fact is that this is an exercise in vanity  a clear lack of perspective and its very disheartening.  What am I doing about it? Raising awareness.  Now I am going to call YOU out.  This is why I think your heart is in the wrong place.  When it makes YOU uncomfortable you perceive it as complaining of course but when you are making others uncomfortable you are raising awareness or as you say here brought to the table of discussion a real issue.  It really is scary how indoctrinated the Orwellian left has become.,BrownU,d7h1x7b,-1,t5_2sbc1
