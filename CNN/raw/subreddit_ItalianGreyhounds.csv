It can be deadly and expensive for dogs.... it can turn into a slicing blade that cuts up their insides as it makes its way through their digestive tractstomach.   My wife didnt know that...and didnt realize her entire floss mint flavoured! was eaten by Frankie one day.   BTW  Hes yrs old and hes completely back to normal.  ,ItalianGreyhounds,cefjhom,3,t5_2sfsk
309422,0,t3_1xmquc,awww that is adorable. When I was younger I had a babydoll maltese well  but the younger one specifically had to had all her teeth removed poor girl and her tongue was ALWAYS out like that it was adorable in a sad kinda way but she loved life so it was okay!My IG tends to yawn and keep her tongue out for a few seconds longer..almost as cute,ItalianGreyhounds,cfcu8bb,1,t5_2sfsk
486148,0,t3_1znx42,mine loves to sleep under the covers so get used to that. theyre really skittish to strangers but very nonaggressive loving dogs. make sure they have to room because i could play fetch with mine until my arm gave out. ,ItalianGreyhounds,cfvj1hi,1,t5_2sfsk
497777,0,t1_cfwmuiz,We basically took him everywhere we could. The pet store or friends houses   and the dog park. We made attempts to get him in any situation we could think of like kids or other dogs of varied sizes. We started when we first got him. If another dog growled at him myself or my Husband would simply step in front of him Now if he feels uncomfortable he will walk behind us and sit down. I think he realized that we will protect him so now he is great with others. We may have gotten lucky because he has an outgoing personality. ,ItalianGreyhounds,cfwun2d,1,t5_2sfsk

8394544,0,t3_4uiv8q,This is not an answer to your question but for me the best way to get rhe puppy to be calm and to let me sleep has always been to cuddle. I cant picture having my Italian greyhound puppy and not take advantage of the pure joy of laying down hugging her feeling her warm tummy and sleep or just relax,ItalianGreyhounds,d5qv5dw,2,t5_2sfsk
8429016,0,t3_4r8elj,Where do you live?  If youre not in a hot state your IG will need a puppy pad to go inside during the winter and bad storms.  They are obstinate in going outside during bad weather.  We have a doggie door they use and the puppy pad on the washer next to the doggie door as an option.  I have males IGs so theres a puppy pad flat and one perpendicular on the washer that is taped onto the washer.  You wont confuse them  they are very intelligent.  Enjoy ,ItalianGreyhounds,d5v628k,1,t5_2sfsk
