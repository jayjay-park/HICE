1008972,0,t3_25n4rm,Forex Rate Movement USD  Rs. . As on th May This should interest you NRI folks who send money home regularly. Since August  the rupee has appreciated by almost  rupees per dollar. If NDA forms the government as expected we can expect to see a further appreciation. In which case it will be expensive for you to send money. You will need to keep a hawks eye view on the movement and capitalize on every dip that occurs because the long term expectations assuming no shitty external factors hit us like they did in last years currency crisis with the NDA government are that the rupee will continue to appreciate to around  levels. Even if the NDA doesnt form the government the current RBI governor Mr. Raghuram Rajan has vowed to not let the rupee depreciate any further. It is expected that he wont let it go beyond . So yeah sucks for you guys. But take this with a grain of salt because we do not actually have the means to plug in a massive leak if the rupee goes on a downward spiral.Assuming NDA forms the government resist the panic to send money home if the rupee starts appreciating immediately. Wait for downward movements because the euphoria will wear off eventually. Capitalize on all downward trends then.,IndiaInvestments,chiz7pi,8,t5_2w2p7

For the first he used . second . which is fine.  And the investment returns he used for calculating monthly is . for first . for second which is also reasonable.I am not clear on HLV calculation assuming Human Life Value or sthng however .Cr insurance is quite a lot? Do you have so many dependants that you need such high insurance.Personally I dont like endowment insurance pension policies. I prefer PPF as a safe and good return giving instrument. He mentioned endowment in the last option hence I am mentioning.Also Im not sure how much is your income. Yet .lakh investment per month to meet education and retirement is way too much. There are other daily misc expenses and short term expenses loan EMIs as well. Single pointed goal based fin planning is okay if you have lot of surplus savings.

4923305,0,t3_3ic7b5,Tried to buy a second hand car a few months ago. As far as I could tell cars in India hold their value well. There isnt a particular brand which popped up to me which seemed more expensive than the rest. Chevrolet Volkswagen can be avoided IMO. To me it seemed like the top variant held its value better than the lower variants. Also cars which looked like they had no physical damage like scratches and dents commanded a higher price. In my opinion buying a car should be based on your needswants. You can buy a car which meets your needswants but is inexpensive and can afford to let go of the resale value.

5067947,0,t3_3keyww,IMO your best bet would be to talk to your manager and try to explain the situation to him. You will in all probability be able to get an extension of about  months. If you have a strong repayment history  years banks will work with you and try to avoid any conflict. If it is an unsecured loan you can try to put some collateral to the bank. I would not be surprised if the bank slapped some penalty on you for this but it is better than not having a line for credit for  years or is it  years I forget. Interest will also accrue during this time period. Debt Restructuring is another option you have where you can get your EMI reduced at the cost of increased duration. It maybe possible to get an extension and a restructuring at the same time.A small tip if your branch manager is not very keen on providing you an extension is that you can write to the regional manager. It is especially useful in public banks. Use this as a last resort but you can write to the RBI and something may come off it. I have little experience dealing with private banks so I cannot say much about their hierarchy.Simply defaulting is the absolute worst thing you can do. NPAs are becoming a big deal now and the political will to tackle them is quite strong. It will in all probability end badly for you if you choose to go down this path. Bank managers are people who deal with this dayin dayout. Be sincere and treat himher with respect. You are willfully defaulting on a loan and unfortunately the bank has all the cards. Remember that banks have a very strong incentive to not mark you loan as NPA as it reflects badly on their books as well. If worse comes to worst get a deal which says that you will be able to pay the principal component only and walk away with minor points on your credit report.,IndiaInvestments,cuwvnkf,1,t5_2w2p7

5887298,0,t1_cxrbc88,I see. I was finding it difficult to pick debt funds for my portfolio your reply helps a lot. Ill stop worrying about diversifying between ST and LT debt funds and focus on ST only for now. If Im to invest  of my savings into debt funds should I just split them into short term debt funds from two different fund houses? Or between gilt short term and nongovernment short term? I cant find any information on the Internet how debt part is diversified.  Also isnt UST better than ST fund if all debt funds give roughly the same returns?

If the company fails to make it in the Index then it is removed or more precisely not included in the next revision of the Index. The whole point of an Index is that it is generated according to rules. Subjective decisions like poor performance can not be criteria. Here is how Nifty is created. Nifty just picks the the larget freefloat market cap companies.

6681830,0,t3_475kv5,Check the SID for funds. Quite a lot of them indicate they can take short positions through derivatives i.e. shorting in futures market instead of in cash market.Whether they will utilize this effectively to benefit their investors is the unknown. There are some limitations that prevent them from going aggressive on this  short positions in derivatives cannot exceed the amount held in stocks. So fund managers cannot sell off stocks go into cash and put the rest in derivative positions. position limits are imposed on the mutual fund in individual stock derivatives. fund mandates may implicitly limit how derivatives should be used. For instance funds with a mandate to invest in growth stocks are implied to invest in growthstyle stocks so short positions are implied to be used infrequently or for that matter derivatives would be used to hedge positions in such funds instead of generating returns.Added to that there is the psychological problem of conveying the short position to the investors. Fund managers and the marketing team will always find it difficult to explain to investors why only their fund is taking a negative view of the markets while all other funds are going long. Then there is the problem with knowing when to take a short position because it take a lot more knowledge than just courage to go against the views of the market to take short positions.You can expect boutique firms to have some more freedom in taking these positions.,IndiaInvestments,d0agkav,2,t5_2w2p7

I have invested  in equity arbitrage funds with monthly dividend option. Since these are basically equity funds the dividend is tax free in hands of receiver and the DDT does not apply either. Also the chances of principal erosion is very low as these funds invest only in arbitrage opportunities. The dividend gives me little extra money every month which I use to pay utility bills. Plus the monthly dividend also eliminates any STCG situation if I had to redeem this before a year. The only downside is the liquidity. It takes about  days to receive amount when redeemed.
