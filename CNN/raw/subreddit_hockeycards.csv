2376398,0,t1_cm5cezj,Basically youre right about retail vs. hobby.Theres nothing stopping any store from ordering hobby boxes from their suppliers but places like Walmart and Target almost only buy retail boxes as they are cheaper and offer better opportunities to sell individual packs for prices kids and parentsofkids can affordSo yah...buy hobby packsboxes for hits chances. If you cant get to a card store you can order them online. Do you live in canada or the united states?? I can show you some online shops for your country that offer great prices well all prices on sports cards are overpriced...but great prices relative to whats availableNote that I dont know of particularly great places to shop outside of north america,hockeycards,cm5fjks,2,t5_2w5ps

8606465,0,t3_4xklom,  Titanium  absolutely awesome and Ive done really well every time Ive opened it  Be a Player Portraits  Very little known product but you can get it for pretty cheap online and its super unique.  Why?  Because  packs per box you get one base card one rookie jersey cardevent worn but still theres some Crosbys Ovis Malkins etc in there one rookie card and one autograph per box.  The thing is the autograph is actually an x and the checklist is great.  I opened a box recently and all  of my xs were of players are arewere stars are one point or anotherKeith Primeau Doug Weight Brendan Morrow Dany Heatley Patrick Marleau and a dual of Chris DruryDanny Briere.

Also in S OP said he had Brown Schmaltz and PoolParty and in my tin of S I had Aho Point and PoolParty.  Regardless Demko and Kempney are definitely tied together.,hockeycards,de978z6,2,t5_2w5ps
