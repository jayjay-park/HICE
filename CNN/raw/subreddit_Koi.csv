5036006,0,t1_cut0w0d,Thanks for the response.I had no clue how long they might be OK without the pump going and I have no idea how long it might take to find them a new home. Wouldnt want them to suffer. The pond is in our garden with thick plants all around. Theres a power cord that trails off into thorny bushes impossible to follow. I suppose the pump is in the pool actually? Oof I wouldnt even know where to start.Craigslist is worthless up here but there are other options. I might have to ping the koi club.,Koi,cut13ir,1,t5_2r2wh
8387595,0,t3_4ugu5o,Find new home for the koi and replace with fancy gold fish comet shubunkin ranchu ryuken and water lilies hyacinth and lotus. Koi eat plants so dont put any in with the koi. This will give you nice fish to look at but also cover surface area with pretty plants which in return will help keep that water pretty clear.,Koi,d5pzwkm,5,t5_2r2wh
