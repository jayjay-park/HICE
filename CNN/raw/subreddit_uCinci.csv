2458352,0,t3_2norpn,I work at the library so I can help you! You cannot reserve a room on the th th and th floors because all of those rooms are first come first serve. So if someone is in there you will have to find another one or sit somewhere else. You are allowed to reserve a room in the UCit  Hour Lab at labs.uc.edu for the maximum amount of  hours. They have  rooms  two of them are equipped with Smart Boards if you need them. You will need your UC Email  Blackboard login to get into the system. ,uCinci,cmfjylt,6,t5_2rmt4
