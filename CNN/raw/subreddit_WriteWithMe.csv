9957874,0,t1_dang9hp,This is very helpful advice. I see how delving into poetrywriting can be useful to draw out deep thoughts while avoiding the creativitycrushing effects of structured writing when writing about past and personal experiences.  I am starting to write about my own life auto bioof sorts but it is taking a lot of effort to structure where do I begin? Do I start with an outline or just free form and write what comes to my mind? Do I go chronological or start from now and work back?  That being said I think it is going to be helpful for me to just let loose and delve into poetry for a while to loosen up my creative juices.  Thank you for your post.  ,WriteWithMe,db5jbns,1,t5_2vy4r
