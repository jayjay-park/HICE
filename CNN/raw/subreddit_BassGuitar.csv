Check out some online bass courses John Pattitucci has a cool one with feed back its not free but they do have a free trial of it that will give you what you are looking for. ,BassGuitar,cm6g42r,1,t5_2qrky
5867044,0,t3_3vlqxy,Try to start out with finger placement exercises combined with finger plucking excercises as those techniques will be the basis of you playing bass. Just dont overdo it with the fingers as blisters on your fingertips suck. After that try to play easy songs like Smoke on the water for example to practice on timing as thats the most important part of playing bass. It could also never hurt to look into music theory and to try to learn play some scales but thats secondary to finger placementpluckingplaying with a pick.That should keep you busy for quite a while so good luck and have fun!Edit also when figuring out new songs try to do it by ear and simultaneously learn your way on your bass. Its nice to know which fret on which string corresponds with a note. Still there is nothing wrong with playing from tabs but online tabs are often flawed.,BassGuitar,cxop86x,1,t5_2qrky

6474836,0,t3_44bfu7,I suppose others may view it differently but I see bass as an inherently collaborative instrument. Yes you can solo on a bass. But its principally a rhythm instrument and rhythm is about playing with others. The great joy of bass playing for me is in being part of an ensemble. Its being the glue that holds the groove together and bridges the percussion and melody. As for what to get Craigslist is your friend. For every real bass player there are a dozen people who bought a bass to learn and never got there. Any used bass in decent condition from a recognized brand will do. Fenders are good but expensive. Squier by Fender is fine. Other common respectable brands are Yamaha and Ibanez. Dont pay more than  or so starting out. Take it to a pro to be restrung and have the truss rod adjusted and the action properly set up. Buy a small practice amp. Get a method book. Take a lesson or two. Learn a simple song. Then find someone to jam with and I promise you will be hooked. ,BassGuitar,czp1lum,4,t5_2qrky

10307802,0,t3_5nl1ft,I actually think this would be kinda fun to play around with. You get the best of both worlds with the fretless and fretted boards. Not everyone ones cup of tea but someone might enjoy it.Is the product info if anyone is curious.,BassGuitar,dccg10s,4,t5_2qrky

10415774,0,t3_5p66h3,When the key is below E and you want to hit it on low notes instead of higher notes. But honestly four strings should be fine I wouldnt worry about it.,BassGuitar,dcop2f4,6,t5_2qrky
