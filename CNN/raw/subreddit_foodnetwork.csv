4666027,0,t1_cti2cbm,I agree with you. Also Dom had just proven in the  minute challenge that he could actually perform well in front of the camera while Eddie messed up on both challenges but Susie and Bob only saw the second challenge. ,foodnetwork,ctiph8m,1,t5_2safc

7551565,0,t1_d3004rj,He was never a believable food authority. He switched his shtick from Caribbean health food to BBQ at the last second and nobody mentioned it. ,foodnetwork,d30ks0y,2,t5_2safc
7612637,0,t1_d2zj83u,Damarius did not quit. Her show is still on.  Lenny WAS a major screwup.  They just did not do any research on their contestants before hand.  Eddie is slowly getting visibility.  Justin they just never did anything with for whatever reason.  ,foodnetwork,d37imgo,2,t5_2safc

8574132,0,t3_4x8dd4,About time. They tried to switch it up last season so it would seem less stale by adding a surprise element but seriously this show has been ho hum for YEARS,foodnetwork,d6dckpq,8,t5_2safc
8990636,0,t3_53c5et,Ive read it. It was interesting to read about the formative years of the network but it didnt really provide me with any insight I didnt already have as to the true character of the stars and executives of the network. Its definitely worth a read if youre interested but I wouldnt say its the greatest thing Ive ever read. ,foodnetwork,d7sjb3t,3,t5_2safc
10380654,0,t1_dckh07l,Couldnt agree more. Ive always thought Zakarian had an awkward personality on air...but it somehow fit with his profile as a transcendent chef particularly once he made it to the level of Iron Chef. Then he started down the road of The Kitchen which I love actually...but his personality tests the limits of even that show. To me this whole schtick of corny cooking concept is beneath him but he doesnt seem to care. Hes sold his soul to Food Network.The concept of the show itself seems also very dichotomous. It manages to degrade the profession of being a professional chef which takes years of learning and hard work while blatantly patronizing the cooks of America. Im sure Food Network wants us to believe that all of their chefs are highly skilled but its trying to sell the idea that any Regular Joe off the street could beat them. It just doesnt seem to make sense.Either way I tried watching it a few more times and only realized that I did not properly distinguish how overused the phrase pro move is on the show. Jesus Christ I hope this show dies soon...but instead theyve made a BAKING VERSION so Im not holding my breath.,foodnetwork,dckpma8,2,t5_2safc
11167470,0,t3_5zeqlv,Seems like they cherry picked a moment on the show to be offended by so as to drive people to their blogwebsitesocial media.,foodnetwork,dextkgx,7,t5_2safc
11629517,0,t1_dg3h3f8,I was enjoying the season but I kinda see why we got the two episodes together. That finale was really underwhelming and the winning cake was super basic ,foodnetwork,dge7vau,2,t5_2safc
