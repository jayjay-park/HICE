You put down contact info of people and whatever device you have the program on if you look up any porn siteslinks it will then send a notification to the people you put down. My friend had a huge porn problem and used it and hes free of the addiction. One of the people he put down was his mom.. so yea pretty big incentive to not search it. Look into it if things get worse but I believe they wont. Just dont forget the church part of the site otherwise.. lol,TonyRobbins,df7hwq3,1,t5_350e9
