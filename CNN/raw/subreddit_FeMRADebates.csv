146727,0,t1_cev282p,Well thinking of intersectionality I would further argue that men as a whole cant actually be said to have more power because the most powerful individuals happen to be men. I happen to be male. I gain nothing by sharing the gender of most CEOs. Their influence which I do agree is quite vast compared to mine and every other average persons does not in any way benefit me nor does it benefit any other man woman or child that isnt related by blood or by friendship or in some other way actually supported by that powerful person. Bill Gates might have more money than god and that certainly raises the average amount of money owned by males but I certainly dont see a penny of it its a statistic that I may be included in but it really means nothing.I do however feel almost be forced to accept that any female spouses of said powerful men which almost all of them have who share an inarguably and exponentially closer relationship to said powerful males than I or any other average person wield a significant portion of their power and influence. Michelle Obama is not president but would there be any who would argue that she is not more influential by many orders of magnitude than the average Joe? Is Melinda Gates not genuinely powerful because of her access to Bills monetary reserves? I dont think that this is nearly as gendered an issue as it has been presented as.

197236,0,t3_1wd4wv,What elements cause them?Quite frankly Ill stick behind my idea that generally speaking these things are mostly caused in our society by reproduction patterns. When were talking about gender I strongly believe that at least traditionally thats how and why weve arranged ourselves. Thats not to say that Im defending the existing structure exactly the opposite as society has changed we no longer need to have reproduction as our primary function. But I do think thats generally speaking where most of this stuff comes from. The larger analysis of this stuff is that gender power dynamics are bidirectional and pretty much always to some degree at least two sides of a coin. The same gender roles and concepts that hurt each gender also help them in other ways. The problem comes when people dont want to throw out the whole thing or at least as much of it as we can and instead they want to ONLY get rid of or cover up what they perceive as being negative while holding tightly onto the positive. I think theres a large dose of entitlement in this way of thinking and it ends up being quite destructive. ,FeMRADebates,cf0woeg,12,t5_2y44v

Even if you look further down in that wiki article it has a list of numerous different theories and kinds of power. Expert power otherwise known as theoretical power is something which we give to doctors and lawyers for example. We defer to their knowledge and expertise because we dont know what they know. This grants them quite o bit of power over us and how we behave. We take their advice and allow them to prescribe medication treatments or surgeries etc.What youre getting at is that the only power thats actual is coercive power the power of the state to coerce behavior over its citizens but in a democratic society that power is an extension of the voting populace.

If not why not? And if so can you give me some examples of it in practice? I ask because you say gtMisogyny can be directed against other men toodisrespecting a man that has adopted feminine characteristics or has assumed a feminine gender role is misogyny even though the hatred isnt directed at a woman. This is something I take to be misandry. Clearly we have different perspectives. I tend to think gender issues are at root a problem of gender roles not a problem of societal misogyny. It used to be the case that when women wanted to enter manly fields they were disrespected told that they were acting mannish and this still happens if you ever hear women talking about another malelooking woman. Here it is the masculine that is considered inferior to the feminine. That is I dont think femininity is hated so much as masculinity is enforced for men and femininity is enforced for women. When either breaks free of the assigned gender role there are negative reactions sexism against them etc.gtI dont know of any other way to convey the fact that patriarchy and the male gaze are not terms used to deride individual men theyre concepts used to criticize a larger system that we all prescribe to.

339218,0,t3_1xxqlo,I am absolutely in favor of mandatory child support when both parents choose to have a child and then the couple breaks up.But in the case of Legal Paternal Surrender there is no child when the legal documents are filed. There is an embryo which is not the same thing. The woman is free to choose between having the child and supporting it by herself or not having a child at all. If she chooses to have the child that is her own choice and she is the only one who should be responsible for it.Think of a situation in which a woman gets pregnant and the next week her boyfriendhusband dies in a terrible accident. The situation is legally identical. She can choose for herself whats best for her own life  but she cannot force another individual to contribute money to help her. I think the abortion is often the best solution for this situation and Id be fine with forcing the man to pay for it because the woman pays by having to undergo the procedure.If the woman needs financial support afterwards there are government programs that can help with this and I am fine with my tax dollars contributing towards this.,FeMRADebates,cffxhv4,5,t5_2y44v

389585,0,t1_cfl0y15,gtWomen are not paid  of what men are for the same work. That much is a myth.Of that we can agree. Clearly the paid work performed by men and women is very different.gt of the wage gap has been shown to be due to differences in the work done and not discrimination. The  remaining could be partially due to discrimination or it could be due to the differences between the work that we cant really adjust for. There is no reason to prefer the discrimination explanation and in fact men could be discriminated against more than women just as easily given the data. Despite this the existence of discrimination against women that reduces their wages is treated as fact.Its very tough to prove nondiscrimination. Its essentially proving a negative. That being said I see no reason to oppose fairly written antidiscrimination laws. Lily Ledbetter simply extends the statute of limitations on wage discrimination lawsuits. That can be leveraged by women racial minorities or straight white men alike in cases of demonstratable wage discrimination. Paycheck fairness act allows employees to discuss wages with each other without the fear of being fired. Again thats applicable to anyone.gtYour other post on the wage gap has several problems. First it assumes the genders not making the same choices is a problem when I dont see a reason to think that.I think your comment here is why equal pay equal work has become such a popular mantra. It skips over the other factors in the wage gap ie. choices of which peoples opinion on will vary based on political viewpoints reaching beyond a simple moral imperative. Im a democraticsocialist. I want Bernie Sanders to be my next president which undoubtedly influences my view on this issue.One of the ways the earnings gap is most useful to me is as a barometer of the gender differences in our society. Differences I do not nor many others here believe there is any innate truth to. Differences that create many problems be it men taking on much more laborious and dangerous types of work missing out on parenthood or women being limited in the types of roles they are expected to do and valued for. Those things all are reflected in one aspect of the wage gap or another. I dont want to see the wage gap go away for the wage gaps sake. I want it to go away because for me it represents the socially constructed gendered differences in capabilities and motivations that we all encounter. Part of why women earn less is that they work less paid hours but its not like they are doing nothing. They are doing more unpaid work at home. Part of why men have so little child custody is that it is based on child care time and they do less on average but its not like they are doing nothing. They are out there fulfilling their breadwinner role. If you want to support women at work you should support fatherhood. If you want to support fatherhood you should support women working. And I try to do both of those things.gtSecondly I think analysing wages simply in terms of the education required is a huge problem. Garbage men get paid well because it is not a pleasant job and so many people dont want to do it. You cant just look at education when comparing earnings. The fields women typically choose generally have many benefits when it comes to job satisfaction and quality of life over the jobs men choose.I think education is an important factor but yes it is not the only factor. Guys and they are all guys out for months on oil rigs get paid what they do for good reason. Its would be an insult to those type of workers to overlook that.,FeMRADebates,cfl5a10,5,t5_2y44v

I have to say I have found this conversation frustrating because you know your numbers but I brought up several salient points and it seems like you didnt acknowledge them at all. Like your comments on underreporting you said exactly what I said yet it has no impact on your conclusions. You can speculate that based on underreporting men are more likely to simply drop out of the results than women but you have no proof and you have no reason to think its a large number or a small number for that matter. It is literally an unknowable amount.Is your take true? It could be true. But if I wanted to I could make a series of unverifiable assumptions to make the male victim percentage much smaller. It bums me out that such an obviously intelligent person is unwilling to use these stats in a sensible conservative way especially when using them conservatively still makes your case. Id understand if you took the lifetime numbers and caveated them with your beliefs about the child abuse numbers being artificially low.

414024,0,t3_1yszcv,gtAbout  percent of the incidents classified as sexual assaults were based on womens selfreports of sexual contact while unable to provide consent or stop what was happening due to being passed out drugged drunk incapacitated or asleep.  Yet only a quarter of these women percent when penetration was involvedbelieved they had been raped.  These were remember college students in an age of widespread awareness of acquaintance rape.  Twothirds didnt regard the incident as serious enough to report.I think theres some faulty thinking here. Theres no reason to believe the only way someone wouldnt report an incident is if they didnt consider it serious.Furthermore sexual contact while unable to provide consent or stop what was happening due to being passed out drugged or drunk really does sound like assault to me.Its true that in general no one is likely to consider it assault if the victim wakes up and is glad it happened but that doesnt change the fact that there seems to be a common practice of having sex with women who are unable to consent.The rest I find pretty agreeable. This is an important point though the  fact that many women after having sex where they were too drunk to consent feel pretty okay about the situation is a red herring.The stat about  believing they were raped likely comes from the attitude of I was too drunk to consent but if I werent I would have. This raises an important question a question that I believe is at the heart of the drunk sex debate am I in the wrong if I have sex with a drunk person who I believe would consent sober?The answer quite infuriatingly seems to be maybe. Moreover theres no uniform answer across all cases a person who makes a habit of this is it seems a rapist only when theyre wrong.That sounds bad but lets take it to an extreme case absolute certainty or the least uncertainty your epistemological views permit e.g. consent negotiated beforehand. That is someone tells me sober that they want to get drunk and have sex with me.

Also in my experience that line from yeats second cominggt  The best lack all conviction while the worstgt    Are full of passionate intensity.could have been written with activists in mind.  Ive escorted for planned parenthood when there were bombings of abortion clinics in my city and that was fulfilling in a way but it also had paternalistic overtones that I didnt find very comfortable.  Aside from planned parenthood none of my other volunteering has been for gender justice stuff. Ive enjoyed some of it but felt fairly misanthropic about most of it.  I really find the culture of activism difficult and the culture of altruism can rub me the wrong way too.What works better for me is to empower the extroverts financially.  I put  of my aftertax earnings into a direct deposit account and empty it quarterly on charitable giving related to the issues that I feel are most pressing to me.  Its probably a bit of a copout but I think it does help.  I also think that just finding parts of your community that touch on what you care about and trying to be a positive force there can make a difference.  Ive run a few campaigns of different indie rpgs that interested me for a local hobby store just hanging out with  kids that signed up every saturday for a few months and I wouldnt call it activism but I did have several real conversations with young boys having troubles in their lives and I think it meant something to them not that all the kids were boys but the ones who approached me outside the game were.

440073,0,t1_cfqaizn,gtI get this and I think most MRAtype people will freely acknowledge this. That said this often feels like an excuse to soften the blow of youre being oppressed. It shouldnt matter if the laws used to oppress women they dont now so arguing that the laws are still misogynistic is in the present not true and derailing from what many believe to be men being oppressed. Like the opposite of what about the menz?The trouble is that most feminists agree that rape laws should  not look this way and have been fighting to get them change to more accurately reflect a version of rape that hinges around consent and not who was penetrated by what. The trouble is that a lot of MRAtype people think that the rape laws are already too broad and that theres an epidemic of women lying about being raped to punish men for their poor decisionmaking. I think you and I agree that the rape laws need to change where they dont recognize male victims but Im not sure you can say the same for other MRAleaning folks.gt These same patterns of behavior are men being oppressed by the legal system.Maybe although its hard to say for certain exactly how to handle this. I mean I know a lot of feminists support the elimination of mandatory minimum sentences and widespread reform of the justice system in general because its brutal racist ineffective and entirely out of control. I havent really seen many potential solutions proposed here that arent we should punish women more as if that kind of parity is desirable.Certainly feminists almost universally support the elimination of the base assumptions that lead to genderbased differences in sentencing namely the paternalistic assumption that women are weak and need protecting.In cases where leniency is provided due to extraneous factors as it often is in cases where the convicted is a motheretc we will probably continue to see differences in sentencing along gender lines until we see something approaching custodial parity and an acknowledgement that women are not natural caregivers. Again a perception that feminists would like to see change.I dont have any trouble acknowledging any of this where I have trouble is in talking about this as institutionalized misandry that is institutionalized hatred of men comparable to the widespread historical subjugation of women as a class for the benefit of men as a class. These are areas where the subjugation of women has come back around to bite men in the ass and I understand that the fact that these things being rooted originally in misogyny doesnt come as much consolation when youre living with the consequences but I think the historical context is too important to ignore and rewrite in an attempt to bolster credibility for a movement that could otherwise be a force for a lot of good.gt Black men have historical been portrayed as savage whitewomen huntin rape machine beasts. Black women have not been portrayed in this same light. It is distinctly the black mens maleness that has led to their persecution as predators which has contributed to decades of laws that protect white women by making it stupidly easy to imprison black men. I expect one would argue that this goes back to racist notions but not all black people are viewed in this light just the men. It is because they are black men that they receive such treatment by society.Something like  agreed here. This particular intersection is interesting though as if you unpack where the pieces of this comes from its a sort of weird intersection where historical misogyny and contemporary racism are intersecting in such a way as to bite a specific class of men in the ass. The current state of things is unacceptable but conventional wisdom in antiracist and intersectional feminist communities is that this particular expression of oppression is a result of racism and not oppression of men as a class. One of the illuminating factors in coming to this conclusion is sort of an attempt to trace the power structures involved women are not typically in charge of writing enforcing or cementing the laws of the land. Womens representation in organs with political power is still quite low. In order for the oppression to be misandry you would be forced to conclude that men are oppressing men on the basis of hatred of men. It makes more sense to me that white men who still disproportionately control all aspects of the criminal justice system from the lawmakers in congress and the justices in the supreme court down to the beat cops are oppressing black men on the basis of racial hatredracial bias.Either way its  unacceptable and I dont think youll find a feminist out there who disagrees but institutionalized misandry is a hard sell.,FeMRADebates,cfqdmpo,0,t5_2y44v

447543,0,t1_cfr2r4t,If you are speaking of the MorganMock drama I can say I have no idea. I think a lot of trans people are having a hard time expressing their feelings and why they are doing what they are doing and that society jumping to conclusions isnt helping. So sometimes they express themselves with anger.If we accept that we were our assigned at birth gender then we must admit at some point we were no longer our assigned birth gender. Where would we define that time? SRS? Parts are too superficial and irrelevant to some. HRT? Sometimes it takes months of therapy to get there? When you first realize you are trans? Well the longest processes in all of transitioning is finally realizing what is causing your suffering and how to fix it. Most trans people I speak to had been hiding their gender disphoria from themselves and others for years. Its similar to homosexuality in this way. When does someone become homosexual? Gay marriage? Their first gay sex? When they want to start screwing someone of the same gender as them? Were they born that way?Are trans born that way? Yeah there is enough proof to determine that the differences in the structure of men and womens brains are also reflected upon trans people with their gender identity. Mentally a trans girl is a girl. Physically perceptually she may be look like a guy but that isnt on the inside.The rebellion of that previous identity the one that was assigned to them Its a false face a mask. Trans people rebel against being held to the standard of that mask. There are plenty that feel they are girls transition to become physically female and want just want to live a normal life. But there are problems with that. Society isnt at a point where it can properly recognize trans issues most people think that you are gay if you like a trans girl or have had sex with a trans girl. That there is some inescapable stigma attached to maleness that even appearing male once a long time ago will cause men to become gay. If she looks like a duck acts like a duck and calls herself a duck why does it matter?In an ideal world Id really only consider people to be transgender if they are currently uncomfortable with the ratio between gender identity and physical sex but there is that societal baggage that changes peoples experience and it would be a shame to silence a person because they only suffered in the past. People who have transitioned have their perceptions of the world changed as a result of how they were raised and lived. If someone wants to deny that in exchange for looking only to their future I wont fault them and if someone wants to use the wisdom gained from their experiences to help guide others who go through the same thing I wont fault them either.,FeMRADebates,cfr5ibn,1,t5_2y44v
447971,0,t1_cfr1whx,I have a group that is quite adverse to trying new systems. We only made the leap from . DampD to Pathfinder because they were so similar. The lore is extremely interesting in both Old World and New World. I chose Mage the Awakening purely because it was more accessible at the time. New World feels like the e for storyteller. It takes a lot of Old World of Darkness concepts and simplifies them. Made it easier for me to run a session before everyone had read the book. Here are your five paths and your five orders. Choose one from each of these... Even then Im distilling it even further and playing more into the narrative and concepts than the rotes rules and paradoxes. Maybe in a later campaign when everyone is seasoned in WoD I might slowly transition back to OWoD or blend the stories and rules of both.Two other story tellers tried WoD before me but they didnt touch the complex sociopolitical aspects of it or even let the players play anything but humans. I wanted to change that up and give them actual power then not really focus on that for an objective driven game.

480509,0,t3_1zee46,Im egalitarian not MRA. I was raised feminist and I struggle with the implications of my Mothers feminism for myself all the time. I dont blame her I understand what she was reacting to. Although it has affected me personally intellectually I am still very sympathetic to a lot of feminism and react in a viscerally negative way to MRA most of the time. It has been a long journey and it isnt over. It messed up my ability to seek out and function normally in sexual relationships through my s. Even after being happily married for some years now I still privately struggle with negative selfimage for being a male sexual being. Less over time but the feeling is just as fresh as a yearolds pain of realizing that masturbating and fantasizing about women makes you a complete creep and must never be discovered by anyone.The idea that all men are potential rapists. The idea that men having consensual sex with women are perpetrating violence against them. The idea that women only tolerate sex with men because of a social structure that forces them to which they delusionally think is their own consent. That rape is something one might do completely without awareness believing that one is having normal consensual sex and even with consent you have no idea whether it was really rape unless explicitly told after the fact and actually it is rape anyway because of society. The idea that if you ever think it is even possible for any rape accusation to be a misunderstanding or false you are a rapist type promulgating a rape culture. Every rape accusation against a man is true which means if anyone ever accused you of rape it would be true even if you did your absolute best to establish consent. Please dont misunderstand I deplore rape and of course I dont think rape victims should be put on trial and slutshamed.All my interactions with women are colored with the understanding that I am basically considered a rapist. Having almost any social interaction with a woman even a simple hello to a coworker or involuntarilyinconspicuously noticing an attractive person at the supermarket is creepy depending not on your intent or actions but on a womans interpretation of these actions  when experience processed rationally suggests women are not any more infallible in their interpretations or charity than any other person. I irrationally feel that when a woman makes these judgments they cannot ever be questioned and it causes me an ambient fear because of course I am not in control of what other people think or when they decide to use creepshaming tactics but they must have more authority than me on this anyway because of what I am by birth. Creep pervert neckbeard. Increasingly I will be dirty old man any time someone finds advantage characterizing me that way. The idea that if even I just go to work normally and act politely and with empathy I am participating in structural violence against women simply for being a man at work. A woman should be in my place.In this way feminism is unlivable for me. I just cant think about things through an old familiar feminist lens without hating myself and excessively privileging any woman who uses feminism as a weapon. Through that lens life is a long word problem with the implied solution that I have to die and stop existing for justice to be done. Even after many years I have to realize Im doing this and break out occasionally to exist normally. You wonder whether the people who came up with these ideologies that govern your life really thought about how they would affect sensitive people who actually believed them but were of the wrong gender.I realized that for me any force that feminism has it has because of ethics and not the other way around. I tend to my ethics not to my feminism. And that ethics concerns the treatment of individuals not aggregates. And I do my best knowing that other people will interpret me unfavorably when it suits them I know what I really think and do I do not own their stereotypes of me based on my membership in some group. And unfortunately a helpful thing for me is to quietly limit the time and depth of interaction I have with many people who publicly identify as strongly feminist particularly men. Its not that I cant be do business respect these people as individuals that there is any overt conflict or that I discard feminist arguments. But at a personal level it does not tend to work well for me. ,FeMRADebates,cfuvxwm,3,t5_2y44v

Its been rejected repeatedly including in the definition you offered in a redditlog. Mister refers to all of MR not to welloff males.Uh . . . yeah. Thats my point. Mister refers to all of MR but its also a term used to refer to welloff males. Its an implication that the two groups are one and the same.gt Your argument is that choosing an otherwiseneutral word doesnt make it less dismissive I agree.No my argument is that choosing an actually neutral word would make it less dismissive and that mister isnt a neutral word. Im saying that words sometimes have more than one meaning and you cant ignore one meaning of a word while pointing at another and saying ha ha look a faggot means a bundle of sticks.Mister means two things. It means conventionally an adult male and usually one whos reasonably welloff. It means in the context of AMR a rmensrights poster. The reason its used by AMR is for the added implication that the two groups are one in the same. Just like if I started referring to feminists as femmes the implication would be that only women and maybe effeminate men are feminists.Which is why I dont use that term by the way even though Ive considered it just to showcase the hypocrisy.gt Its not the word that offends you then but the choice to be dismissive.The word has been chosen specifically to be dismissive.,FeMRADebates,cfv19yn,5,t5_2y44v

580637,0,t1_cg69f4o,gt It would be awesome if mens sexuality werent tied so much to masculinityit would grant men more wiggle room in terms of identity meaning they wouldnt be punished sexually for not conforming to gender roles. See this is where I hope I didnt come off wrong  I personally think that yes traditional gender roles do kind of enforce masculinity but I do NOT want to make it seem like masculinity is wrong.One of the biggest foulups of feminism in my opinion is their alienation of traditional women  that is those who embrace traditional gender roles.  There are a lot of girls who embrace that.  There are a lot of guys that embrace their traditional gender roles too.  There isnt really anything inherently WRONG with that  the problem comes when other lifestyles are... well... I hate using this word with a passion but oppressed.  Or rather suppressed would be a better word. Which is why for the MRM its going to be a fucking nightmare  youre going to have traditionalist and redpills who try to portray traditionalism and masculinity as the one true way for men and youre going to have people like me who sometimes like to be masculine sometimes dont who are trying to tell everyone CANT WE JUST GET ALONG?That is why I think trying to push men to be defined by themselves would be better  not necessarily defined by how many women they seduce or how much money they make.  And again there isnt anything WRONG with people defining their own masculinity and manhood by that  the problem comes when that is the ONLY thing that they are judge by.  editgtIt would be awesome if mens sexuality werent tied so much to masculinityit would grant men more wiggle room in terms of identity meaning they wouldnt be punished sexually for not conforming to gender roles.

Happiness or a sense of place are not necessarily great measuring sticks particularly for those who have traditionally held power. Im reminded of The Happy Negro. White people in the US had a lot of motivation to believe that black people were happier as inferiors and generally when a more powerful person asks you if youre happy you say yes. Strangely enough it appears that perhaps black people were not so happy with the given situation.Similarly in families with servants its very common to hear the bosses say that the servants are loved like family while the perspective of the servants is decidedly more ambivalent.Or I remember reading a book about a gay man reminiscing about how thrilling it was to go to a gay hot spot when it was still illegal in the UK and saying that now most of the spice is gone. Maybe this guy had more fun when being gay in the earlier part of the th century. Does that really count against fundamental human rights?. . . . .EDITgt Simply put whats considered oppression by people here may not be considered oppression by people somewhere else. To then tell them that theyre being oppressed and trying to fix their society isnt dissimilar from the same cultural imperialism thats been happening for the last  years. As such I think that can be a bit problematic.This isnt a new idea FYI.

583480,0,t1_cg6jm0d,Yeah I have a problem with standardized tests in general. I was one of the lucky ones so I wasnt as affected but its complete bullshit. Its basically a test to see who has had more practice at regurgitating useless information in order to find an aggregate number grade on how well you are able to quickly retain and comprehend information. This could be achieved by more practical means. Also the test is too culture specific but thats a different arguement for a different day lol.Anyway I disagree about completely blind applications especially removing the institutions from the transcript entirely. There is no denying that you have to do more work to get an A at harvard than to get an A at a school like Boston university. BU is notorious for their awful curves which rediculously inflate grades. I have seen professors give  point curves its insane. Anyway if we look only at the grade then an inflated A from BU becomes just as valuable as an A from harvard which is unfair. I think the best way to get a full picture of the applicants is to review as much info as possible. Obviously you cant do it for every applicant so there definitely has to be some form of a blind application process but I just dont think it should be end all be all. ,FeMRADebates,cg6lgt4,2,t5_2y44v

More importantly what about all of my criticism of the mrm? Im a mod yet I still criticize the mrm plenty.  I have cut back but yes I certainly still do.    gtexcept to compare disagreeing with people to being a murder?Thats not what he said that was him explaining why he didnt feel why something was intentional was not a deciding point in trolling.He did not say these people are like murderers he said well what about another example we dont mae a distinction with intent here.  I dont think it was the right wording but knowing this user I do believe he deserves benefit of the doubt.  I am very willing to believe his use of murder was just to show that in other situations we do not consider intent.  Not indication of equivalency which he also denied was his intent.  I also am very willing to believe his assertion of what trolls are are simply the definition of what he gave not indication of this only applies to feminists.  Lastly his assertion of this is the minority should be taken into account.  He is clearly stating most amrs are good users and he opposes generalizing the amr sub.  That can not be denied.  The parts that indicate his personal opinion are most amrs are good users and he is in support of banning generalizations of amrs.  gtI think we have to delineate between insulting a subreddit or making an observation or discussion in good faith. We got some trolls from AMR that does not mean a majority of AMRs are like that.Im fine banning insults of other subs. The rest.  gtBut not something where the person said IME AMR is mostly trolls. Thats just their opinion. And we want to allow opinions made in good faith.Is something that we allow both sides to say about each other.  But clearly not his own opinion as he just stated otherwise.  Rather an example.  It would be odd  to use mras instead of amrs for an example as he was just talking about amrs.Perhaps he should have used general and not point to either but considering that generalized statements about amrs slipping under the rules as it is a sub was one of the main reasons the mods asked this question it makes sense he would talk about amrs.  Mensrights and againstmensrights were the two subs that we mods were discussing with each other that were the main victims of mistreatment.

630035,0,t1_cgbuwv0,I dont disagree with anything that youve said and I myself noted above that I personally wish to bring male suicide to the forefront. However I just dont feel that it has to be done at the expense of female suicide.My point is that the article oversteps regular debunking when it starts asking questions like whats worse three times as many female suicide attempts as male or far more successful male attempts at suicide? They are both problems and they both deal with people who need help and they can probably both be addressed without taking away from each other. In other words I feel as though it creates a conflict where there need not be any. Personally I do think that saying male suicide doesnt matter is horrible and dismissive but I also dont think that its uniquely uniquely male problem. Distinguishing between attempts and successful suicides I think doesnt quite cut to the heart of the matter.For instance the causes of suicide and parasuicide differ based on gender age sexual orientation socioeconomic levels and psychological factors relating to depression and mental illness. This means that we can effectively target areas which affect both genders differently. Men who are from lower socioeconomic levels and reaching middle age are more prone to attempt suicide than women in the same position. However women are more prone to attempt suicide at younger ages and are more prone to bouts of depression. But to add to this being LGBT result in being  to  times more likely to commit suicide.My point is that this problem isnt strictly gender related and deals with a variety of other intersecting societal issues so wed be best to not make it a battle of the genders where it neednt be. ,FeMRADebates,cgbvw9w,4,t5_2y44v

Some people rightly or wrongly perceive this as being tacit assent qui tacet consentire videtur he who is silent is taken to agree.Considering the emphasis place on affirmative consent by feminists when it comes to sexual relationships I find it interesting that NOW uses the Roberts Rules of Order when considering voting at its state regional and national conferences. Roberts Rules of Order uses the Silence Procedure where silence is consent.This is quite different to the expectations we have in legislative bodies where a vote of yes or no or abstention is required.

845666,0,t3_23qlqz,Well firstly let us assume a reasonable hypothetical where a womans right to choice was similarly restricted.Say you had a very young minor rape victim who wants nothing to do with the child she is impregnated with whose parents refuse to allow her access to abortion. The rapist steps forward indicating a parental interest in raising the child. Should the rape victim who wants nothing to do with the child be forced to pay the rapist to support the child born from her rape?Next the standard of living issue  to what degree of comfort  security does a child have a right whichs responsibility should be forced upon their parents as necessary? If a child is entitled to a percentage of a parents income to be spent solely on them above and beyond what another parent is providing... then why are single parents and stillmarried but lowincome couples exempt from this mandatory standard? Shouldnt a single parent be forced to earn a certain minimum amount of money each month beyond their own personal expenses that must be earmarked for childsupport purposes or else face jail time and even having their child taken away? Shouldnt a stay at home parent be informed that they arent meeting the minimum financial contributions expected of all other parents and that they or their spouse by proxy need to step up the childsupporting income?Who wants to have that conversation? Listen I know youre working hard to keep a roof over your head and food on the table but if you dont start earning an additional  each child after taxes each month above what youre making now youre getting imprisoned for child abuse... and of course if you go to prison youll fall majorly behind on child support which will extend your prison sentence which will...Or is it not about the autonomous right to decide to be a parent and not about the extrafinancial obligations a parent  parents have towards their child?Then what does justify forcing a rape victim into a parental contract with their rapist?,FeMRADebates,ch0emsx,4,t5_2y44v

You should probably tell uproudslut that PgtIve always interpreted the antislutshaming movement as saying there is nothing wrong with being a slut  Im sort of fascinated by you having a different interpretation.My belief is that a slut is someone who has reckless sex. That could be a man in a longterm relationship who risks ejaculating inside his partner while not wearing a condom and while she is not on birth control or it could be a woman who has sex with a stranger without wearing a condom. So I believe that people should not be encouraged to be sluts the way I understand it but really Theres nothing wrong with being a slut gt Theres nothing wrong with having safe consensual sex with people.gtKeep in mind Im asking about why were concerned with slutshaming but seem so unconcerned with other forms of shaming. We should care about the draft we should also care about other issues such as homelessness and wage inequality. I do care about those. I dont say the draft is bad! lets campaign against the draft! oh I dont care much about murder.Right and if people came forward and said they were harmed by Xshaming or Yshaming I would listen. If enough people came forward I would probably think its something worth doing something over.gtIm asking why we see so much regarding the word slut and so little regarding other insults.Perhaps because of its effects on those who are called it.

But this ends up being problematic. Peer review is just that  peer review. Review by academics and experts in the field  not the lay person. Why is that the case? Because we offer them more credibility to assess and critique the study given their expertise. Let me put it this way  the reason why peer review is considered the legitimate check on academic mistakes and missteps is because its being reviewed by other experts in the specific field of the study.

930036,0,t1_ch9zg39,First I want to genuinely express my sympathy for the many struggles you have shared. I have no animosity towards you personally and I wish you only the best for your future happiness and success. I too would love to give infinite ReDos and I know that isnt possible. But that is where we part ways ideologically. This is not a debate over how badly to fuck over kids. This is about right and wrong about placing responsibility where it most properly belongs. Bottom line current child support laws are a case of trying to make Two Wrongs  A Right.I know it is a bad situation for a girl to find herself pregnant on accident even if she was careless and could be considered to have brought it on herself. I dont wish that on any woman. But once it does  happen she has some tough choices to make choices only she  can make due to very good reason of bodily autonomy and she bears full responsibility for those choices. I know it isnt fair but it is true and right. With exclusive control comes exclusive responsibility for your choices. This is the part where you get mad at me I can only appologizes in advance and recommend you pull the ripcord immediately. Im sure your mother was a good person. Im sure she loved you very much and she did the best she could after making the decision to keep you. But she made a mistake. She chose to subject you to deprivation and hardship when she didnt have to. She could have aborted or given you up for adoption and she should have. She had a responsibility to prevent suffering or provide you the best possible life she could and she failed. The most selfish and narcissistic path is to subject your children to poverty because you lack the strength to suffer the emotional burden of giving them away to a better home or prevent their existence entirely. I know that is hard thing to do but there is no excuse for failing to make the proper decision no matter how difficult.This isnt about making it easier for men to Fuck and Duck. This is about recognizing a man has no authority to enforce his wishes and that because he cannot choose he cannot be held responsible for the consequences. If we are to maintain child support laws mostly unaltered then we must also give men the power to compel adoption or abortion though I cant endorse that specific mode. The only viable alternative is financial abortion Legal Parental Surrender which preserves both persons parental rights and bodily autonomy. ,FeMRADebates,ch9zztb,1,t5_2y44v

Hes not oppressive to me as an individual but as a man.gt Okay. Again I will ask you how is he oppressing you by merely existing?Because hes a man. Hes part of a class of people called men. That class is part of a larger cultural context of male dominance. Men as a class have oppressed women as a class. That means theres an imbalance of power between us based on where society places us based on our gender. By in large the power of gender as viewed by society will be in his favor. gt So now youre saying that men dont oppress you?Im saying that I never called anyone a piece of shit. Me you and him are not responsible for the society were are born into. He and I didnt create the power imbalances between us but they exist none the less. Painting me as angry and intollerant of someone whos only crime is being born into one class that has some historical power over my class is ridiculous. This is only compounded by the fact that I am part of many classes that oppress him.gt So even if  of the powerful class gave willingly  of the power to the notso powerful class as long as society isnt radically altered what does society mean in this context anyways sweetiekat? it still doesnt matter whatsoever?This is kind of a weird hypothetical scenario. Nothing like this has ever happened and I doubt it ever will.

1175359,0,t1_ci1lx03,gt But Id have to point out this practice is just like thinking I wont hire black men because they will end up in jail.While I think its problematic for women not to be hired because they might get pregnant. I think your being hyperbolic in comparing these two things.Approximately  of women have passed on their genes historically that means theres a very high chance any one women is going to get pregnant when you compare this to the likelihood and black person will go to jail its much higher comparatively. Also our society does not consider being pregnant to be a bad thing for all of society whereas being convicted of a crime is almost always considered bad for society in general. Finally is likely many black people are convicted at such high rates due to prejudice and not culpability along with being disproportionately targeted for victimless crimes like drug use Not to mention drugs predominantly used by many black people are  much more illegal than those used predominantly by other ethnicities for example crack vs cocaine.So while there are some similarities is not just like thinking this.

I actually agree very much with her in this that  life begins at conception we should and can differentiate between an abortion consented to by the mother or demanded of by medical contingencies versus other killings of a fetus.But it places MEW at odds with a history of feminists who have tried to keep fetal homicide laws out of the books because of their fears it would be used against doctors and women.,FeMRADebates,ci33vkh,2,t5_2y44v
1186657,0,t1_ci30e5i,Stephen K. v Roni L. gtWe are in effect asked to attach tortious liability to the natural results of consensual sexual intercourse. Stephens claim is one of an alleged wrong to him personally and alone. Procedurally and technically it is separate and apart from any issue of either parents obligation to raise and support the child. Although actually requiring the mother to pay Stephen monetary damages may have the effect of reducing her financial ability to support the child we need not get into this area of discussion or resolve such problems as may exist in that area. In the posture of the case as presented to us the state has minimal if any interest in this otherwise entirely private matter. Claims such as those presented by plaintiff Stephen in this case arise from conduct so intensely private that the courts should not be asked to nor attempt to resolve such claims...gtIn summary although Roni may have lied and betrayed the personal confidence reposed in her by Stephen the circumstances and the highly intimate nature of the relationship wherein the false representations may have occurred are such that a court should not define any standard of conduct therefor...gtThe claim of Stephen is phrased in the language of the tort of misrepresentation. Despite its legalism it is nothing more than asking the court to supervise the promises made between two consenting adults as to the circumstances of their private sexual conduct. To do so would encourage unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters affecting the individuals right to privacy...gtWe reject Stephens contention that tortious liability should be imposed against Roni and conclude that as a matter of public policy the practice of birth control if any engaged in by two partners in a consensual sexual relationship is best left to the individuals involved free from any governmental interference. As to Stephens claim that he was tricked into fathering a child he did not want no good reason appears why he himself could not have taken any precautionary measures. Even if Roni had regularly been taking birth control pills that method though considered to be the most reliable means of birth control is not  percent effective. Although slight there is some statistical probability of conception.L. PAMELA P. v. FRANK S. gtThe issue on this appeal is whether a father whose paternity of a child has been established may assert as a defense to his support obligation the deliberate misrepresentation of the mother concerning her use of contraception. We agree with the Appellate Division that the mothers alleged deceit has no bearing upon a fathers obligation to support his child or upon the manner in which the parents respective support obligations are determined...gtNoting that the only factors to be considered by Family Court in fixing an award of child support are the needs of the child and the means of the parents the Appellate Division held that the fathers allegations concerning the mothers fraud and deceit had no relevance to the determination of his obligation to support the child...gtThe interest asserted by the father on this appeal is not strictly speaking his freedom to choose to avoid procreation because the mothers conduct in no way limited his right to use contraception. Rather he seeks to have his choice regarding procreation fully respected by other individuals and effectuated to the extent that he should be relieved of his obligation to support a child that he did not voluntarily choose to have. But respondents constitutional entitlement to avoid procreation does not encompass a right to avoid a child support obligation simply because another private person has not fully respected his desires in this regard. However unfairly respondent may have been treated by petitioners failure to allow him an equal voice in the decision to conceive a child such a wrong does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.,FeMRADebates,ci348zc,2,t5_2y44v

1269726,0,t1_cicapzq,gtMill had expressed his concerns with feminism in an essay that predated the publication of The Subjection of Women emphasis mineThe entire essay did have a sense of familiarity that made it a confusing read since Im not very familiar with Mill.  Im pretty sure I read Utilitarianism and that was it.gtFrom the previously cited paragraphs it seems clear the Mill sees the religious object as that which brings the region. Mill saw the goals that bring the religion and the religion itself as synonymous they are one and the same.Thats an interesting assertion.  If we want equality then we ARE equality?  Ive certainly seen that expressed before. But what Im seeing with the new context Thanks for providing btw you are always a fount of knowledge is Mill asserting that when people yield to sentimentality rather than reason they ruin their own movements and in Subjugation he allows that women are prone to that.  But in the same breath he offers that their subjugation could be the cause so being leaders in their own movement could make it a selfcorrecting problem.I dont see a lot of sympathy for emotionalism from Mill and Im curious to what he would think of the bleeding heart direction that liberalism has taken.  But if he was inadvertantly providing a dire warning for feminism it sounds like it would be applicable to anyone else.

Those are traumatic incidents but we tend to focus only on attacking the aggressor and not on healing the victims.  Right now we dont have shelters for male victims of either nor are counseling services easily available to such people.I also think that easily available counseling would help catch aggressors as people who commit rape tend to do it multiple times.  If multiple victims come in for counseling being too afraid to try to press charges talking about the same person then you have a better shot of actually dealing with such people.So... take care of more victims catch more aggressors.  Neat.gtI know this is asking for specifics but would it be shared time or each parent gets a separate amount of time? I am more asking as it seems in places where it is shared the mother often takes more of the time than the father.Not sure honestly.  On the one hand if its shared time people have more freedom to do what they want... but on the other hand societal expectations may force the guy to take less.  Id probably do something like X amount of time shared between both parents in cases where theres two parents and each parent must take at least  of that time or something.  But thats just a guess at this point.  What Id really do is look over countries that have maternity and paternity time and see how their versions work in the field.

1445946,0,t1_cixhn05,I struggle with agreeing with your urge to distance from their prescribed solutions and acknowledging the reality of a shared historical manosphere.  When I first came to mensrights there was considerable overlap.  Denying their existence feels to me to be similar to a feminist saying radfemhub what?  those arent feminists!When I say that they have a common philosophy I mean that they agree that there are cognitive biases which cast men as moral agents and women as moral patients.  They agree that there are tons of issues for marginalized men that are only acknowledged to the degree to which they can be without looking at how masculinity plays into them.  They agree that men experience a great deal of injustice and unfairness.  MRAs elect to try to engage in a comprehensive campaign to change society in a way that addresses these.  Redpillers say that sucks.  life isnt fair.  easier to change yourself than the world so how do we go about becoming the men that benefit from this arrangement and make sure those issues dont affect us?  I think TRP would classify the MRA approach as romantic and their approach as practical and Im not sure I would disagree.  I just know what feels right to me and that is tilting the windmill particularly because not all men have the luxury just to try to exhibit what feminists would call hegemonic masculinity and because I really dont want to be that kind of guy.More importantly they are also engaged in examining the same social dynamics and there are some fairly cogent observations that they will sometimes offer.  In one post demonspawn said men are disposable.  society is built around that fact.  as long as men are disposable equality really means female supremacy.  I dont take the same call to action from that observation but it is always a glaring caution in the back of my mind when I watch the empathy gap manifesting in issues where feminists and mras are somewhat in accord.  I also feel like a willingness to be radical and question cherished cultural attitudes is mandatory for a mens movement.  TRP glamorizes their views as willingness to accept unpleasant truths I can get behind that.  I dont always agree that those unpleasant truths are in fact true but I do agree that we need to be ruthlessly ready to examine them.I also... Im not sure how exactly to say this.  I dont endorse their attitude at all.  But a lot of the belligerence and swagger of more extreme parts of the MRM comes from an internal struggle not to view women as precious and delicate things that need to be protected or men as tough stoic guardians of womens emotions.  I feel like there is WAY TOO MUCH condemnation of TRP for being misogynist with WAY TOO LITTLE condemnation of their solutions as being misandric and I dont think that fact is lost on them.So while I dont align myself with them at all I feel like denying their relevance to the MRM is disingenuous.

If you arent doingwilling to do them that says something negative about your manhood which ultimately puts you in a not as good light when it comes to women. If youre from white middleclass suburbia those displays are insulting. Period.I agree that media does set some form of baseline but that baseline is perceived by minority groups to be the baseline for white people. So the say Hispanic norm doesnt change even in recognizing what the norm is for white people.

1531596,0,t1_cj898xx,gtI dont know you but I doubt that anyone ever thinks that they disrespect women. Oh no i was trying to make an effort to say that it is distinctly possible that i may not respect women as much as i might believe that i do.gtMany of my male friends actually didnt really respect women  at least to the degree that I did. And thats the interesting thing. When I really started thinking about times when those same kinds of stereotypes and prejudices came up with my female friends and it almost never did  and when it did it was far more benign than my male friends.Well I might suggest you need better friends then but I have a tendency to avoid people who i view to have shitty views on subjects or are just generally shitty people. If a guy is like ...and then i railed her all. night. long. It paints a picture in my eyes of the sort of person he is boisterous and that reflects negatively on my view of him. Enough of those situations and I avoid interacting with the person.Basically what i mean is that its also distinctly possible that you dont really see the stuff at least as clearly that your female friends do or perhaps dont view it as bad because of your own bias and not saying thats necessarily your fault either. I cant really think of a good analogy or example to express my point but its possible that your female friends are just as bad or perhaps do things in ways that you may not view as being as bad or being benign etc. It also could very well be the friends you associate with particularly with respect to women and men.Either way though Id hope that more people respect women AND men and i think its often a twoway street and can be hard to see both sides. I try to remain objective and thats largely my intent with discussing the situation youve presented. I imagine theres always more to a story than is being told and the idea that men dont respect women on the whole I find hard to connect with my view of reality. Its possible as mentioned that my view may not be accurate either and is even relatively likely but I find it hard to square the idea of men disrespecting women and the only reasonable answer i can think of is that the determine factors for what constitutes respecting women may be different.Who knows perhaps you and your girlfriend work because you share the same views with respect to how women should be respected that most other people dont  which doesnt necessarily mean that they dont respect women just that you may view it different.

1579733,0,t1_cjeacpb,gt If feminism means whatever it means in any given context then in reality it means nothing.Thats simply not true which is why I dont think that a discursive definition is merely tautology even though its obviously tautological. To return to my previous example does religion really mean nothing because Paul Tillich courts in Germany and the Internal Revenue Service in the United States all offer different albeit precise definitions of religion that apply in particular contexts? It seems more accurate to say that religion has no singular absolute universal meaning but that there are a number of distinct and noninterchangeable concepts or definitions that fall under the term. This doesnt render religion or feminism meaningless but it does mean that without more specificity the terms dont cary a lot of precise philosophical content. So to answer your second questiongtSo why do you label yourself or others as one?I dont refer to myself as a feminist without qualifying that statement. I am a postmodern feminist a poststructuralist feminist or a Foucauldian feminist working predominantly on the basis of Judith Butlers early work on performativity depending on how much specificity a given context warrants. Unlike a vague and unqualified feminism a precise label of Foucauldian feminism actually conveys content about what my beliefs are.I take the same approach to other feminisms and feminists Wendy McElroy is an equity feminist and thus not part of the same group as a Marxist anarchafeminist like Germaine Greer. Thats why I advocated NAFALT as a response to the bailey and motte problem raised by ufemradiscussion.

1605103,0,t1_cjhc4i3,Well to the best of my knowledge there is no research specifically addressing this but it should be possible to do so by for instance writing up fictional profiles of researchers rather than simply attaching names and having the experimental group contain pieces of information which suggest oncoming retirement while the control group does not. If information which suggests oncoming retirement does not affect assessment of the impact of the research or affects it less than knowing the gender of the researcher then we could determine whether the bias is due entirely to such an effect.However I think youre seriously reaching at straws at this point if you think that its plausible that likelihood of retirement accounts for the bias in the case of research because the bias is much greater than it is in the case of resume assessment but the retirement rate of female scientific researchers at academic institutions is relatively low in part because one usually earns a PhD well beyond average age of first childbearing. ,FeMRADebates,cjhhp4l,1,t5_2y44v

1614765,0,t1_cjilm3l,gtwhich it seems to be since youre proposing there is absolutely nothing common to Feminist thought other than a general inkling to favor women doesnt that devolve Feminism to nothing more than slightly Sexist attitude rather than a social ideology?First off youre projecting some of your perceptions of feminism onto my point. Ive never suggested that all feminism carries a general inkling to favor women it doesnt and so I wouldnt call its hallmark an attitude that is slightly Sexist sic. Once you deny women as the subject of feminism for example it doesnt really follow that your feminism is distinguished by a focus on women.Second I would agree that feminism is not an ideology but I wouldnt reduce it to a single common attribute. Feminism is a diverse divergent dynamic and imbricated set of philosophies values practices etc. The connective tissue of feminism is discourse and family resemblance not any single feature.gtFurthermore if Feminism is so meaningless then how do you explain the groups rallying behind its banner reveling in its achievements and shouting its name as a cry for specific changes?Imbrication of diverse feminisms. Many not all different feminisms address similar or identical goals are developed in the same milieu and grow out of each other. gtAre you suggesting that they are all mistaken in thinking their shared gathering of political and social action is not a movement?Im assuming that this should read ...action is a movement?Yes and no. A lot of different feminisms are working towards similar goals and could accurately be understood as part of a larger social movement. The extent to which all feminism gets conceptually homogenized into a generic singular movement spanning from womens suffrage to queer theory however seems misguided and intellectually lazy.gtSetting up a distinction for branches of an ideology is perfectly valid CatholicismChristianityMarxist FeministFeminist but they dont invalidate the core movement as a standalone. I agree. Its the lack of a core of thought common to the different branches that invalidates the idea that theres some essential core feminist ideology not the existence of different branches of feminism. If Marxist feminism radical feminism equity feminism Foucauldian feminism etc. all agreed on a common set of base theories and elaborated from there wed have a clear example of a core ideology and subsequent branching out but thats simply not the case. gt I simply dont understand what we have to gain by saying that Feminism is so amorphous as to be practically meaningless.An accurate apprehension of the situation that leads to more accurate language and thought as well as the capacity to interrogate the discourses that constitute particular forms of feminism in their local particularity.If its the case that there is no substantial philosophical content or social practices common to all feminisms its important to understand that simply for accuracy in our discussion. If we tried to critique ethics without understanding that utilitarianism and neoKantian conceptions of rights are completely different things wed be setting ourselves up for some headaches. The same is true with feminisms.Once we understand the diversity of feminisms it opens up new perspectives on how particular things get invoked or excluded as feminism. Discourse analysis looking at how particular ways of writingspeaking about feminism and engaging with it constitute particular sense of what the term means becomes a possibility. For people who want to criticize some things that fall under the umbrella of some feminisms its also a very important point for pragmatic purposes. The idea of an allencompassing generic feminism can be used to link all sorts of shitty ideas ie women are the only serious victims of domestic abuse so efforts to help DV victims should solely focus on women to all sorts of good ideas ie women should have the same political social and legal rights as men. This links can open up the door to equivocation see any of the motte and bailey topics that have cropped up in this sub or they can simply be used to stigmatize anyone who is objecting to feminism.By recognizing and emphasizing that the essence of feminism is disagreement with other feminists and that there is an incredible diversity among various feminisms one can situate a particular critique while entirely sidestepping these issues. ,FeMRADebates,cjiphs5,1,t5_2y44v

They have no place in a debate forum. I think we need to have more womenoriented posts and people need to talk about how it affects women. Jaronk makes some good points here and while I think his points would be perfectly fine in a sub that had more equal representation if every thread about women can be refocused on men feminists arent going to hang around. Have we ever had a thread about the rape of women? I know weve had dozens about the rape of men which is awesome! but yeah we need to talk about women sometime too. Ive been thinking about trying to do a weekly Womans Wednesdays post that highlights various womens issuesfeminist actions to help encourage this.As utryptaminex said in their comment I think there needs to be an overall change in atmosphere which is unlikely to be accomplished with more rules. The older users of the sub tend to have a greater understanding and respect for each other and very nuanced criticisms of the MRM and feminism. While some new users do too it is clear that there are others with personal vendettas and come out guns a blazin trying to prove a point.I also think adding feminazi regardless of whether it refers to a nonuser or not to the banned words list is a good idea.

They also feel that as men they deserve a woman with traditional family values  like submission and docility toward her lord and master. Thanks to the stereotype of a meek little cute Asian bride they frequently look for love from Asian countries.Hell the idea of a woman who will kiss your ass and obey your every whim and do any sexually perverse thing you ask is such a fantasy that even Egyptian men are also importing a lot of Chinese brides. Yes women in the Egypt just have too much freedom and independence I guess.There are probably some nice enough shy guys who watched too much anime porn that are also on the market for an Asian MOB. Those marriages might work out. Sorcha told me that the uncle who is in a happy marriage is not an asshat and seems pretty decent. But lets be realistic  those dudes are probably in the minority by a huge margin.And here is a Misogynist on the issue note hes Black so youre not allowed to say anything unflattering about himThat is the bottom line folks. That is the reason more white women are jumping on the I hate Asian women bandwagon. Because Asian women are swooping in and picking up the guys white women are trying to save for later. They are fast losing their place as the most wanted type of female that they have enjoyed for the longest of time. White women just like black women are spending too much time with the wrong type of men. Then get angry when the decent men are picked up by others and they are stuck with more losers.

1703506,0,t3_2dvaoh,On the Origins of Gender RolesWomen and the PloughgtWe test the hypothesis originally put forth by Boserup  that crosscultural differencesin gender role norms and attitudes arose from differences in agricultural technologies usedtraditionally. In particular she identifies important differences between shifting cultivation andplough cultivation. Shifting cultivation which uses handheld tools like the hoe and the diggingstick is labor intensive and women actively participate in farm work. Plough cultivation bycontrast is much more capital intensive using the plough to prepare the soil. Unlike the hoeor digging stick the plough requires significant upper body strength grip strength and burst ofpower which are needed to either pull the plough or control the animal that pulls it. Becauseof these requirements when plough agriculture is practiced men have an advantage in farmingrelative to women Murdock and Provost a. Also reinforcing this genderbias in ability isthe fact that when the plough is used there is less need for weeding a task typically undertakenby women and children Foster and Rosenzweig . In addition child care a task almostuniversally performed by women is most compatible with activities that can be stopped andresumed easily and do not put children in danger. These are characteristics that hold for hoeagriculture but not for plough agriculture especially if animals are used to pull the plough.The result is that societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture  rather than shiftingcultivation  developed a specialization of production along gender lines. Men tended to workoutside of the home in the fields while women specialized in activities within the home.This division of labor then generated norms about the appropriate role of women in society. Societiescharacterized by plough agriculture and the resulting gender division of labor developed thebelief that the natural place for women is within the home. These cultural beliefs tend to persisteven even if the economy moves out of agriculture affecting the participation of women onactivities performed outside of the home such as market employment entrepreneurship orparticipation in politics...gtOur findings provide evidence that current differences in gender attitudes and female behaviorhave indeed been shaped by historical differences in the agricultural system. Specifically we haveshown that individuals ethnicities and countries whose ancestors used the plough today havebeliefs that exhibit greater gender inequality today and women participate less in nondomesticactivities like market employment entrepreneurship and politics. In an effort to identify a channelof cultural persistence we examined variation across second generation female immigrantsborn and living in the US but from different cultural backgrounds. We find that even examiningthis group of individuals who face the same labor market institutions and policies a history ofplough use is associated with less female labor force participation.Overall our findings provide evidence for the historical evolution of gender norms and beliefsand their persistence and importance today.Pagan Spirituality A Guide to Personal TransformationgtFeminist sociologist Janet Chafetz points out that this shift was not so much a function of male oppression as it was genetic necessity. Women who plowed had much higher rates of miscarriage. In agrarian cultures fields were larger and much further from the homesite and pregnant and nursing women had limited mobility.

1756682,0,t1_ck0jp13,gtThat isnt the case for black vs white  the difference is far smaller and in some situations the difference vanishes.True for some differences but not so much violent crime. In the case of violent crime the blackwhite and malefemale split is very similar. Race is about as good a determinant for whether you have committed a violent crime as gender is. So if the race divide is merely a social thing then the violent crime divide in gender probably is too. I do agree that there are almost assuredly biological differences that show themselves in social issues. But I dont think that that means that men are necessarily inherently more violent. I think a lot of that assumption comes from the thought process of men are better at violence so they must be more okay with doing it. And ya know Ive been slapped by a bunch of girls. Only one guy has ever hit me out of anger. And from what Ive heard thats pretty common. Now it is hard to tell what is nature and what is social conditioning. Most culture was formed back when physical strength was far more important than it is today so a lot of gender differences were far more pronounced. So men may be more violent.

And if this is happening women are more likely to be doing it as they as a group survive more suicide attempts however we cant tell what was staged and what was just a botched attempt. Not to mention the in between  where someone wants to die but is willing to not die if they get help they are sort of testing reality to see if anyone cares. And yes women seem to get more help that doesnt mean they deserve less or they are less important just that men need help as well because every person in need needs help.Again you can not know who is going to die on the next suicide attempt. Even if that guy is more likely to he could be one of the men who survive and the women you overlooked could be one of the women who succeeds in one attempt. ,FeMRADebates,ckdwtvi,2,t5_2y44v

I dont hear too much that I really enjoy. Just to give some perspective of what I like Garbages Bleed Like Me I think is the last phenomenal album Ive listened to. Anyway. Im not sure we can call this a double standard because this doesnt feel like an apples to apples comparison. Maybe Im wrong and I have both their artistry messed up. But the author certainly presents Andrew WK never heard his music before as the type of musician to where..well..it IS a performance. Larger than life. Thats the style the genre of performance. We accept that. With Lana Del Ray its different. Shes trading on authenticity. On being honest and genuine. So if people find that may not be the case its a lot more damaging in that regard. Now there might be a gender role thing going on in terms of wanting our male performers to be big and boisterous and our female performers being honest and introspective. Probably is Anyway.

Because the male component of the study was exploratory the data and results presented in this summary represent women only. Optin webbased two universities no male data analysis to compare to.

However now take the recent CDC study almost double the sample size phone based optout includes men include the whole country. We see under reporting. We see a lot of underreporting but we see it more in men and not at near the levels the CSA study would suggest.In a vacuum the CSA study might stand but its not born out by either of the more recent CDC studies or numerous others and its the lynchpin of the argument that  in  women is raped during college.Underreporting occurs.

2089761,0,t1_cl5g09o,gt but still men are overrepresented at the top as doctors professors and administrators professional chefs etc. So nursing isnt female dominated? I mean thats a field in its own right a position that a male may want but is potentially denied due to his gender. So your response to this is essentially that he should go out and become a doctor instead because thats the male version thats the male dominated field. That doesnt sound a whole lot better.Ill grant that more men are in higher positions. Fine. Thats a problem sure but I dont see how pushing for more women in the higher positions doesnt also limit those same positions to men when were not simultaneously given men alternatives like including them in nursing. It seems to me that if you want more equality that perhaps we should be focusing on getting more men in nursing positions so that theres fewer men trying to be doctors so women can pursue positions as doctors instead.Youll notice that we need more male nurses isnt a great deal different from we need more female CEOs or we need more female doctors im merely approaching the problem from the other gender and displacing women instead of displacing men while saying that my goal is or rather an element you not you specifically should support as supporting mens problems with becoming nurses solves womens problems to become doctors.Still the idea that there are no female professions seems at least partially incorrect. If youre just going to redefine the term of dominated to include those positions that are at the top and then discount the numbers then youre really redefining what it means to dominate a field. For example cooking for your household was predominately a female job nearly exclusively a female job so cooking as a result was a female dominated profession. They may not have been paid in the professional sense certainly but that is a field that was female dominated.,FeMRADebates,cl5gduj,1,t5_2y44v

Which is fine except for the average person its extremely difficult to differentiate between these two types of antifeminists. Feminism for me as an average person who doesnt know about all the theories and different namesmodels is still inextricably linked in my mind with being able to vote being able to attend university and have a career. Feminism for me means that I am not expected to be in the kitchen and many other things as well. And I am immediately biased against someone who says they are antifeminist because I see them as against these things which are very important to me. This is especially the case because its not hard to find people commenting on articles perhaps trolls? or in some places on reddit who are antirights for women. I think this predisposition to bias against antifeminism also applies in the mainstream media and with a more general population for similar reasons.

I dont find this a double standard in any way shape or form.But you dont count Mens Liberation as a part of it even though it was clearly the source of the modern MRM.gtSeriously Ill reject all the academic and historical precedent and analysis done by experts and professionals if you can supply me with examples that show that the MRM made many tangible efforts to work with feminismI already cited Farrell butgtWhy? Because you dont like it?No for the reasons I already gave. My argument is extremely clear.By your own evidence and citations the MRM comes from the Mens Liberation movement. By your own evidence and citations that movement had a schism into profeminist and antifeminist factions for that to happen its logically necessitated that the Mens Liberation movement harboured at least a significant body of profeminist thinkers. Therefore the MRM is directly descended from a movement that widely tolerated profeminist thought. I assert that efforts made by the Mens Liberation movement to work with feminism count towards your request for the same reason that efforts made by secondwave feminists to fight patriarchy count towards recognizing the accomplishments of feminism as a whole today.Meanwhile youre rejecting the Mens Liberation movement as the MRMs roots in favour of a completely disconnected league for mens rights from decades prior without being able to draw any connecting lines beyond a similarity in name. You rail on about how youve given evidence and citations but when challenged to show how the league for mens rights is in any way relevant to the discussion you sit back and lawyer out an argument about how we should be able to view the movement through different phases like feminism except not actually like feminism because feminism didnt completely disappear for over  years only to spontaneously reemerge as youd like us to believe happened with this broadly viewed MRM.,FeMRADebates,cl81nc6,3,t5_2y44v

Possibly there are extremists and trolls who state such views but these are in the vast minority and are pretty much unilaterally downvoted to the bottom of any post.

The problem is this isnt defined or differentiated for broader audiences.  So while a feminist might say misogyny in the sense of doesnt completely and uncritically uphold and support women to the exclusion of all else other people hear it and think they mean hatred of women generally.

2165273,0,t1_clf180q,Due process is the means by which we as a society protect those accused from being railroaded by the system. Other limitations of what factual evidence can and cannot be entered into evidence are burdens on the state because the state is a much larger entity with far more power and resources than the one accused and due to this much more likely to be not only be corrupt but likely and capable of using that corruption.As far as I am aware rape shield laws are the exception to this in that instead of being a burden on the prosecution they are a burden on the defendant. One issue for example is  that sexual history can also precludes the defense bringing up such totally irrelevant facts like the accuser having falsely accused others beforehand.But the sole issue really is that the court is not there to protect the accuser. In a criminal court case the defense attorney the juror and the judge are there to protect the defendant from unfair prosecution. Laws in the court room should not in anyway unfairly burden the defense. If we wanted too we could easily go back to mob justice. We have a judicial system so that the accused get every chance to prove their innocence before we take away all of their rights. This is why its is prove beyond a reasonable doubt.So the question becomes As a juror you know its possible the accuser has falsely accused others before but the law may not allow this fact to be entered into evidence. Is knowing this is a possibility reasonable doubt? Some would say no some would say yes. That is a problem because the very fact this law exists to some people introduces reasonable doubt to every single rape case.Edit clarified type of evidence,FeMRADebates,clf21cm,24,t5_2y44v

2181453,0,t3_2k16q9,In court its not enough that someone probably did something in order to convict them.  You have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.Our court system is built to favor the accused.  This is IMO a good thing because courts that are designed to favor the prosecution are far far easier for people to arbitrarily abuse.Unfortunately because of this its pretty much a given that at least some rapes that occur have no possibility of being convicted in court.  I dont know what to do about this and unlike some people I dont think that give people carte blanche to put any man in jail simply by accusing him of rape is a good solution.  But my point is that just because theres insufficient evidence to convict someone of rape it doesnt follow that that person is necessarily not a rapist.Now I dont know who is coming forward or what theyre saying and I havent personally been following it and I dont particularly care to run off an go read all about it.  From the limited information I have all I can say is that I have no opinion about whether those allegations are true.  And really I think that ought to be the take home.  If someone committed a crime even if you cant prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that they committed that crime youre still within your rights morally and legally to tell people that it happened.  If you hear an accusation you shouldnt be arbitrarily dismissive because as we well know there are plenty of ways that people can commit crimes but get away with them but we should also view the accusation with a grain of salt.,FeMRADebates,clh468e,12,t5_2y44v

2277539,0,t3_2la50v,Being extended male privilege at some point does not prevent you from experiencing prejudice later in life. However there certainly is some validity to the idea that issues affecting ciswomen are different than issues for transwomen. Think of it this way should transwomen be allowed to compete in womens sports? Probably not because theyve had the benefit of high levels of testosterone through puberty and will have an unfair advantage as a result. Unfortunately talking about this issue this way is a bit misleading. It makes it sounds like you can clearly define when someone will have an advantage and when they wont when that isnt really the case.The only real solution is not to be exclusive at all but design whatever program you are trying to implement in such a way that no one will have an unfair advantage. In sports you could achieve this by favoring activities which involve manual dexterity and intelligence rather than physical size and strength. If youre giving out scholarships it means you cant consider things like academic performance test scores or participation in extracurricular activities because all of those will be confounded by the gender of the candidate. Instead you would really want to look at a candidates basic understanding of feminist principles or whatever you are trying to promote and their enthusiasm for the cause. You would only want to look at their academic performance in order to insure they have the basic level of competence required to complete their degree and put it to good use.The key here is understanding that feminist goals will be met by putting people in power who understand the importance of and need for feminist principles not by trying to directly correct the effects of sexism which is impossible.,FeMRADebates,clt80kh,5,t5_2y44v

2285226,0,t1_clts3v2,I completely disagree. Gamergate is largely a retaliatory movement by people who are feminist in one sense against people who are feminists in another. While the former group doesnt selfidentify as feminist and the latter group does what were seeing in my opinion is a rejection of a kind of feminism by a group that is primarily comprised of nonfeministidentifying quasifeminists with a few notable exceptions. Just look at how emphatically gamers who dont consider themselves feminists have embraced Christina Hoff Sommers a feminist author.I think one of the central issues underlying Gamergate is the monopolization of the feminist label by a fringe group of feminists. Its bit like if fiscal conservatism was so widespread throughout society that people didnt bother identifying as fiscal conservatives anymore and suddenly the Tea Party came along and said youre either with us or against conservatism we are the only real conservatives.The vast majority of gamers are born and raised in cultures where core feminist values are now so commonplace that most people dont even acknowledge their roots in the feminist canon.

2294136,0,t1_clv94ff,gtOr do you mean that by controlling the pregnancy the woman is also controlling the man?There is an element of that.  But it also comes down to the womans control of the mans DNA and control over the choice of how to use that DNAeven when the implicit or explicit agreement when the man provided DNA was for the purposes of having a child or not for having a child.In any case I think discussing it purely in terms of rights is a mistake the issue is the balance between rights and responsibilities and how those are spread between men women and children.  For example if abortion was entirely illegal the woman would have no rights as to whether or not the child was born same as the man.  Likewise both would have the responsibility to provide for the child after birth.Making abortion legal and making it entirely the choice of the woman lets her disregard those responsibilities for the cost monetary and emotional of an abortion whereas the man has no control over whether or not he will have to fulfill his responsibilities.  I honestly dont much care whether or not abortion is legal so long as rights and responsibilities are fairly divided.Because its an imbalanced situation finding that fair divide is extremely difficult.  However legally the court system has allocated a larger share of responsibility to men while simultaneously providing women with a larger share of the choice.  Thus when abortion rights are framed entirely as a womens rights issue my body my choice I cannot agree.  In allocating responsibility to the man after the child is born the legal system insists that the DNA involved is still the responsibility of the man who provides it and thus the man is still a significant stakeholder in the choice of whether or not to have an abortion.  As a stakeholder the man should have some power or choice in the matter and I cannot accept an argument that insists that all choice should be concentrated in the hands of only one of the primary stakeholders.,FeMRADebates,clv9s75,1,t5_2y44v

In other words in the beginning she talks about why the phrase is lacking but shes still acknowledging that the phrase has meaning.

However if your argument is that theres no distinctions then demonstrating a distinction is a pretty good counterargument.Oh my god dude. Youd think  characters explaining how that is not my argument would be enough... CTRLCgtIve never claimed it was completely unoffensive. I would say that adults are capable of dealing with a little offense.My argument wasnt that it wasnt completely unoffesive. I assumed that was a given. My argument was that showing a distinction between gay and feminism does not by itself mean that removing gay would be justified but not feminism.gtMinor by your definition. I personally think its substantially more offensive when a publication thats meant to be catering to your group decides to insult that group.Minor by my definition. Much like feminism being on the poll is minor by your definition. Personally I believe both are minor. One is substantially more offensive yes but still minor and undeserving of the backlash it got.Also insult? You call jokebanning feminism criticism but this is insulting? Rest assured calling people out on their bad behaviour is most certainly criticism and thats what this article was doing. Generalizing? Yes. But insulting? No. Criticising albeit insultingly so. But still criticizing.And why shouldnt a publication criticise its own audience? For example I would support a feminist publication criticizing feminists.This brings us to two conclusions  All criticism should be immune from any backlash for the sole reason of being criticism.or Criticism can in fact be badly executed and thus justifiably become targeted by those it is criticising. In which case your claim that criticism of feminism gets more backlash than criticism of other things becomes even more complicated than I originally thought. If feminism is criticised more in the first place and more insultingly so which I believe is the case the fact that criticism against it seems to be tolerated less becomes much more understandable.gtAgain just because you dont agree with the conclusion does not imply the situations are identical.Oh my god dude. Youd think  characters explaining how that is not my argument would be enough... CTRLVgtHow many cases can you think of where Time Magazine was forced to retract an article or a poll?gtIt certainly isnt technically difficult but it isnt often that Time backs down in this manner.Youre still using the word forced but Ive argued before in our exchange several times btw how there is no reason to think Time was forced to remove the word which funnily enough happens to be yet another claim of mine which you simply ignored or dodged from having to respond to. Several times. Like right now.As I say in literally the very next paragraph that was supposed to be the supporting argument to the statement of mine you quoted here it is very likely that what happened here is Time simply realised that given the way feminism dominated the poll due to some people using it to express their political opinions which was not its intent and given the amount of people complaining about the word being on it and the people complaining about those people the poll has been turned into a political battleground of sorts. Since this is not what they were aiming at they decided that the best way to rectify this was to simply remove the word. Its not a display of any noteworthy power feminists supposedly wield just a display of what happens when a heated political issue is discussed in an inappropriate environment.I know this sentence is a mouthful just read it a few times.gtAnd yet again Ive explained why I consider those situations different.And I have explained using  characters why that by itself is irrelevant. How about you refute that first? Hint A tldr of my argument against this is in the very next sentence to the one you quoted here. gtIt is however a really good first step to demonstrating that it is possible for one outrage to be justified and the other not to be.Yeah it is. Now start walking.gtIf your argument is theyre identical and therefore you should treat them identically then it is perfectly reasonable to respond no theyre not identical.Oh my god dude.

After all theres a bias against Intelligent Design in biology but thats completely warranted.I have to agree with this. Youre dead right. Of course the facts have a liberal bias point has to be taken seriously.But... be careful with that particular analogy because it can be turned around. Intelligent Design is an interesting case because strictly speaking it has not unlike Young Earth Creationism been proven false. The dubious virtue of Intelligent Design is that it is not a scientific theory at all but rather an unfalsifiable metaphysical theory. It has no business being in a biology department. It is an ideology.Now the trap is sprung. One surely has to ask  on what basis do we eliminate intelligent design and yet make room for feminist biology I cant see a place for either. If one wants to argue that feminist perspectives can usefully inform biological enquiry surely one could say exactly the same thing about ID? My point here just to be clear is not that feminism is like ID. My point is that they are equivalent in this one aspect that they are both essentially ideological commitments that have nothing to do with the discipline of biology.

2587969,0,t1_cmwbl2g,gtWhy do you think that thats the case?Some of this draws on parallels to other gender ideas and how they are generally thought of so it may or may not hold up.  A great deal of thought and effort has been put into understand womens role in society and how various things in society affect women not a bad thing but the same has not been done for men except in how mens role affects women.The argument is made not saying you make it that the greater amount of inhibitions on the toys that boys can play with is a negative for women since it teaches boys that girls toys and girls are inferior.  This viewpoint looks at the affect on women and stops there instead of looking at how it affects men independent of anything having to do with women.  Not that those analyzing this situation have to look at how it affects men but it shows that some people will stop short when they find an answer they are looking for.Another example is the issue of harassment online.  One viewpoint says that women are the target of special  harassment that is sexist as it targets their gender.  Failing to find a direct correlation for harassment targeted at men the viewpoint concludes that men are not the subject of the special harassment and thus women face greater opposition online.  The counter is generally that studies show that the incidence of harassment online is about the same for everyone.  What follows is arguments over what constitutes sexual harassment of men and whether it qualifies as special or not.  I would argue that all online harassment shares a common set of defining characteristics but can divided into any number of subsets.  Sexual harassment targeted at women online is a subset but it is not the only subset and may not even be the most severeconcerning.This leads to mansplaining.  The definition used by Solnit is a very narrow definition intended to describe a specific type of instance in society.  It is defined by a situation where a woman is treated condescendingly by a man else who assumes they do not know something because they are a woman.  As far as I know no evidence exists of how often this occurs or how often any combination of genders for the people involved occur.  From what I can see that some subset of people will act this way toward everyone is not contentious.  It may also be that there are some areas where women are assumed to have more expertise and an inverted definition could be used.  This is why I said that mansplainging may well be just a specific case for a larger phenomenon but it gets almost all of the focus.None of this should taken to say the examples I gave dont really exist or are false.  Rather they are real and exist in a context that isnt always taken into account.  by special I mean set apart from what can be thought of as the normal or average.  In this case sexual harassment is set apart from harassment as a special case.  Probably poor word choice but the best I could come up with.,FeMRADebates,cmwdv9z,7,t5_2y44v

She was later arrested and sentenced but despite her ridiculous behavior and the outcry over it she is still a professor there.  I consider that being allowed to stand when you can violently break the law over a differing view and still keep your job as a professor something is incredibly fucked up if you have some different idea of what qualifies as allowed to stand I suppose we can just agree to disagree.

2646757,0,t3_2q9ag1,gtwhat is nontoxic masculinity?Heres the thing about Toxic Masculinity. Many of the traits are not necessarily negative its when they are taken to extremes they are negative. Its not calling masculinity toxic but things that when carried too far are negative to ones health.Example One thing described as Toxic Masculinity is that men are taught not to show emotion. That doesnt mean the opposite being a Cry baby is a good thing. In fact emotional control is important and is a positive. But when you bottle your emotions to the point that you explode and shoot up a bunch of people its very toxic.Men are taught to be strong. Working out taking care of your health all good traits. Dedicating your life to muscle gain to the point you are taking steroids or other illegal drugs... yeah thats toxic.Being assertive? Good. Being aggressive to the point that you are willing to hurt someone for your own gain? Bad. Being someones bitch and letting people walk all over you... also bad. Im going to come back to this but the opposite is not only viewed as negative but uses language specifically female.Again Toxic Masculinity is specifically describing masculine traits taken to the point that they are detrimental but does not automatically demonize the masculine traits itself. Toxic Relationships are relationships that are bad for you but that doesnt mean all relationships are toxic. Toxic Masculinity is not intended to demonize men nor masculinity but examine things that negatively impact men. As a man I am finally glad these things are getting looked at. Could have saved me a lot of pain and suffering.gtare we not simply just hating on masculinity? I am fighting to have my response be OH BOOHOO. Reason why? Toxic Masculinity is a term from the last decade. Almost all of the traits are things that were viewed as positive with no second look meanwhile female traits have been viewed as negative for centuries. Being illogical or irrational or too emotional is a female trait hell women were sent to asylums for Hysteria. Being pathetic or weak is a female trait its being a pussy. The very language of these negative traits is female specific.  Even if a woman shows a positive male trait such as assertiveness shes called a bitch and as pointed above being a bitch can also be laying down and letting people walk over you. Men being told that genetically they should be sleeping around with as many woman used to get high praise for being studs while women doing the same thing were sluts. Both have the same risk potential STDs and parenting unwanted children but it was viewed as positive for one sex and negative for another I am using the past tense for this as it is changing... but it is still in progress and there are areas where men are still praised for the notches on their belts and women are still shunned.And Toxic Masculinity isnt even hating on the Male traits. Its examining them and looking at the point they become dangerous. It finally examines the things that men are taught that CAN negatively impact their life.gtWhat is toxicfemininity?Toxic Feminity would be traits perceived as feminine that are also taken to an extreme point that they harm the individual. Sharing emotions is important being unable to stop crying about everything is not. Caring about your physical appearance? Good. Caring about your physical appearance to the point of anorexia or bulimia or arguably to the point of extreme amounts of plastic surgery? Definitely bad.The reason we dont see the term Toxic Feminity too often is because most female traits have already been demonized. As mentioned above there is a whole set of language where negative terms for things already have female specific words. Pussy weak scared Bitch overly aggressive or its antithesis of being walked over Hysteria too emotional slut sexual female and others are all terms that specifically exist for female that has been used to oppress women for ages. Most terms referring to female genitalia are negative terms in some fashion. The term Being a dick isnt even always that horrible example The Team America speech.EDIT Sorry I lost steam as my insomnia wore off I need to pass out. so a quick TLDR Toxic Masculinity is not demonizing masculinity but examines traits that CAN become toxic. Meanwhile many female traits have been demonized for a very long time and use specific antifemale language.,FeMRADebates,cn42a7r,3,t5_2y44v

2665114,0,t1_cn620df,I dont think this is just limited to feminism and womens rights groups I think this is a property of all classbased activism. Consider an MRAs view of the draft where males are forced to fight to defend their countries but not females. Seen through the lens of male rights activism this is primarily an attack on the males of the society yet this ignores the purpose of the law to put forward your best fighters in order to make sure there still is a society left tomorrow which can debate such gender equality issues. The activists lens picks a particular facet of a thing and makes that facet the most important part of the thing when that facet is almost certainly just one part of the whole.This is not to say that activists just need to cool their jets and calm down because often their lens has highlighted something that may genuinely be problematic but it does mean that these issues can be made to be larger than they are by focussing on them at the expense of all else. A sexist shirt may well be a problem but it may not be the most relevant thing about the situation.

2687350,0,t1_cn98pxi,gtBe advised I am essentially discussing an anecdote from a source I wouldnt defend here.This doesnt follow the studies I have read it also makes me weary.  I have seen .However here is the APA on the mental health of those who have an abortion.In particular.gtThe best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective firsttrimester abortion than if they deliver that pregnancy. The evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more equivocal. Positive associations observed between multiple abortions and poorer mental health may be linked to cooccurring risks that predispose a woman to both multiple unwanted pregnancies and mental health problems.If we are concerned about women here.  If anything it makes more sense to warn pregnant women to get an abortion.  After all there is proof there that pregnancy is more dangerous than abortions.  I am not for that but we cant pick and choose here.  Concern for womens health should not be be selectively applied depending on the moral controversy of them making such a decision. Also wouldnt there also be a risk of women regretting their decision to keep the child past the abortion timeline?  Lastly when has the minority regret for a decision demand for everyone to take a medically unnecessary procedures and force of unwanted information that one can not decline before?

2800129,0,t3_2s24qw,From the article gt But while theres no data tracking the nationwide disparity in how male and female sexual abuse victims are treated one possible reason male abusers tend to be significantly older than their female victims which leads to larger penalties according to several lawyers who work on these cases everybody seems to agree that the disparity exists.Although there is no nationwide data tracking there has been some research. One example is this study published in Feminist Criminology which tried to prove the hypothesis that female sex offenders are more severly punished due to the evil woman hypothesis. The evil woman hypothesis is in the words of the studys authorsgt In accordance with this theory it is expected that women willreceive more severe punishment for sex offenses because a sex offense reflects asevere departure from gender roles. In addition an interaction is expected for specificsex offense category as it is again assumed that the more severe affronts to socialnorms and gender roles will result in longer sentences.The findings if the study however went against the researchers expectationgtstatistical analysesreveal a significant difference in sentence length between men and women but notin the expected direction. Its somewhat bemusing how the researchers let their disappointment that the evil women hypothesis was falsified shine throughgtHowever it can be argued that the most compelling case for the selective chivalry hypothesis or evil woman theory stems from the examination of more specific behaviors as they apply to traditional gender roles. Unfortunately those studies that examine sentencing differences between male and female offenders have typicallyfound little to no support for the theory Embry R. amp Lyons P. .

2871937,0,t1_cnuiuml,gt No feminists during his life at least ot my knowledge or in any tangible way actively championed against him. Thats a myth that was forwarded by MRAs and AVfM. Silverman himself never said that feminists had stymied his funding his gripe was solely with the government for not addressing male victims.I gotta say that I think this distinction is less major than its being described as. If you spend your life campaigning for female victims and against male victims and then someone commits suicide because people care about female victims and not about male victims then theres more than a tenuous connection.In any case though this is all somewhat irrelevant. You say people need to make sacrifices I say look people are making sacrifices you say well Im sure it helped raise awareness I say no it didnt you say well okay it didnt but thats because you did a bad job with raising awareness. At that point were no longer in the realm of people need to make sacrifices because we both agree that people did make sacrifices were just talking about raising awareness.And raising awareness is exactly what Im saying needs to be done.gt I think that there was by far a greater awareness about mens issues that resulted from it  not only from his suicide but from him having to close his shelter.How so? Who was made aware of it?gt Yeah but cmon man. One is directly related to mens issues while the other isnt. One can also say that terrorism has had a wider awareness since Silverman but it would be absurd to say that they were related to each other.Sure but youre the one trying to imply a causative relationship here. I dont think there is one.gt No because people do. I personally dont care and tend to prefer studies and research to figure out whats wrong with society. Most people arent like that and most activism doesnt revolve around that.I agree most people arent like that but I also dont think people tend to rely on what other people are willing to sacrifice for. Im not convinced anyone said well I thought racism was AOK but then MLK died in the process of fighting it I didnt care about it before he died but now that hes dead I guess Ill start fighting against racism.And at the risk of Godwinning this discussion I really doubt peoples opinions of Hitler improved when he committed suicide.Just dying for something doesnt make people agree for you. Just spending your life on it doesnt convince other people to do the same thing. You have to convince people that your cause is right not just convince people that you personally believe in the cause. Thats what MLK succeeded on. And what Hitler failed on longterm Vgt Hiring a lobby group was what I had in mind which is kind of necessity for any successful activism. I dont think this was out of line at all and I would add that this is pretty much what I study so Im not talking bout my ass. Of course there are other modes of though but its a legitimate suggestion that will probably yield some benefits.Well I guess what Im getting at here is that I actually agree with you. Im just not convinced you agree with you. You started this out by talking about real activism and real change and real world actions and sacrifice and now youre talking about hiring a PR group. Thats a hell of a .gt In other words who is asking for money matters just as much as what theyre asking money for. The MRM has its Malcolm X in Paul Elam but not its Martin Luther King Jr. It doesnt have someone who can bring its message to the general public. Elam is a controversial figure and for good reasons. He says some really spiteful and angry things but thats also why you cant look at people being against him as being against the MRM in totality  unless hes the only prominent voice out there. Then all bets are off.I agree with that too and I think itll help a lot if we do end up finding an MLK Jr. But thats not the kind of thing you can just create. With luck one will show up  it just hasnt yet.However I strongly believe that when one does were still going to have the same group of people complaining that money is being spent on public relations and media events.gt But there are other ways to become publicly noticed that dont require money. Im sort of using money as a standin for resources. Its not all in the form of money but its still in limited supply.gt All you need is one sympathetic journalist to do a story on you and there you have it  instant publicity. But that doesnt happen that much without actually attempting to enact change in a real way.And thats why you . . . hire a PR agency instead of enacting any real change?Seriously once again I want to know what you would do that conforms to your own requirements.

3022606,0,t1_coaiqzd,Well have you ever heard a phrase similar to Never use rape in a story unless completely necessary.  There is actually a famous quote about this I wish I could remember it.  Basically rape has been used for a long time as a cheep distasteful way to get a reaction.  It is basically like a jump scare or gore porn.  Now it would take a long time to go into detail why so I will just say there are some things that if you want to use you better go into it and basically do it justice if not dont use it.  Rape is one of them but certainly not the only one on this list.  Bullying if you are making it for a more adult audience mental disabilities certain historical events domestic abuse are a few more on this list.  They play on the fact we know these are serious subjects with strong emotions behind them.Basically these things can be used as a cheap reaction or garner sympathy without all of that pesky effort or good writing.  But I thought of a game that used rape or implied rape if you fail at one point in the game.  That game is the PS Haunted Grounds.  Now it wasnt the story sure it had a reason for it.  But that reason is convoluted and would sound really weird to explain.  Nor is this game progressive by any means.  Particularly with one of the villains that is very insulting to those with mental disabilities.However Im okay with it here because it fit the theme.  Remember when I talked about in an earlier comment how unwanted interest sexual or not is unnerving?  Thats where a lot of the horror comes from in this game.  Every main enemy has some reason to want to be after you and thats where the game gets its unnerving feeling.The grounds keeper is a mentally challenged man who sees you as some kind of toy that would be fun to break apart.  The maid which I think is like a golem or created human who is extremely jealous of you for being able to taste touch feel pleasure and have kids wants to cut you to peaces and steal that stuff.  The main bad guy wants to use you as a way to get immortality and there is a person watching you through the walls.All of these play on this idea of people obsessed with you often in a personal chilling way that you desperately want to leave you alone.  So the possible rape ending works for me if not needed.  As it does fit this broader theme the story was getting its horror elements for.  I have always argued that there is a time and a place for every subject.  I think perhaps rape doesnt need to have a strong reason plot wise but just not tacked on is there another purpose for it other than to make you feel sad uncomfortable or show this character is evil?  Just put serious effort in a serious subject.  ,FeMRADebates,cobagkd,0,t5_2y44v

3036310,0,t3_2uxu7y,Ok so Im going to start by giving my opinion and just my opinion.. Shes very attractive in the first place.. Being a big girl means bigger boobies and I am an avid avid fan of boobies.. She has skinny girl face. Her face isnt plus sized. Shes curvy. One might say chunky voluptuous or one of a whole host of other terms.I think shes attractive although she could be a fair bit more attractive if she had a slightly more athletic build. She doesnt have to be skinny as some meat on the bones is nice. That said...Now for my lessbutstillopinionated rant...I am not a skinny man to start this. Im around  pounds over the weight I want to be but I also probably have slightly more muscle mass that I did in the past... whatever Im not where I want to be in weight.I dont think telling people that being fat is a good thing. Is this model fat? Not... necessarily but she is a bit overweight. Thats something we all are basically admitting by referring to her as plus sized. Im not saying we should bodyshame but we shouldnt also be lying to people that theyre not overweight. Lying to people just leads them to perpetuate clearly unhealthy behavior and we sort of sanction it as ok.Also just sayin but most people DONT like the aesthetics of overweight people. How are we being honest about the prospects someone should have romantically if were lying to them about how attractive they look. I mean it then turns into a fat is beautiful and now Im being told that Im a bad person because Im not buying into the bullshit that is fat people are beautiful. Im sorry but as a person they probably are attractive but physically? Probably not so much.Now caveat that some people like the aesthetics of overweight people. Youve got your chubby chasers except the term is chubby chaser not morbidly obese chasers. People of Walmart are not attractive and pretending like having XXL lingerie or yoga pants with juicy on the butt which it better not be juicy. take a shower thats gross as anything resembling a good idea is a lie to everyone involved but those handful of people that actually do find big people attractive.Im overweight and Im too lazy to do anything about it. That harms my physical attractiveness and that harms my romantic prospects. Those are kind of feed into each other with a negative feedback loop but Im at least not lying to myself that the problem is the women and theyre all terrible people because they dont like me just for my personality.The whole fat is beautiful too idea is hugely dishonest.On a side note If you are obese and you need a powered cart to get around then you dont deserve the cart. Lose weight. If you cant walk when youre a healthyier weight then fine have the cart. But if the reason you cant walk is because youve just gotten that big then start swimming and doing the elliptical bikes. Work out to the point where you feel like youve never worked out that hard before. Surpass your expectations of what you can do. Seriously cut back on your caloric intake. Get help from a medical professional who specializes in these sorts of things.I wasnt always the weight Im at now that was shitty jobs bad diet and sedentary habits over a period of years along with getting older. I use to be physically fit and apparently according to a good friend of mine I had abs which I was surprised by because Im pretty white and you cant see that on my kind of white people unless you put blackface on your stomach. Im at least honest enough to say that I am not as attractive as I could be. Trying to impose the ideals of fat is beautiful onto people is dishonest on everyones part. That said having some extra weight and not looking like a runway model with anorexia is not the same thing as being plus sized.If I sound like a dick its because I know the situation fairly intimately. Lying to people like those exaggerated examples of people on electric carts in Walmart is not healthy for anyone and theyre already not healthy for several people.

And to be honest Im actually as worried about its effects on the women as on the men assuming that there wasnt any sexual assault in these cases as what seems to be the case. Im concerned that how were talking about sexual assault is actually traumatizing young women into seeing events that were pretty standard into feeling like theyve been victimized.

I would not label them white knights.Men tend to crave female approval.Part of this is the connection between female approval and access to sex. It doesnt even need to be conscious. Female approval is a factor in a mans reproductive success so the instinctive desire for female approval has probably been selected for over many generations.There is also the fact that in current society it is generally unacceptable for heterosexual men to seek emotional intimacy with other men.

3126724,0,t3_2vyhbm,gtWhat is the primary cause of the empathy gap?Ive long argued that the actual reasons for the formation of gender roles in our society is largely based around perceived best practices surrounding reproduction and childrearing and a few bits of biological reality. Child bearing somewhat inhibits physical ability and womens importance for maintaining a population Were less than a century out from when that started to majorly change. Id argue that it was the post WWII era due to advances in technology especially medical technology. The effect of this is to give women a certain protectedinnocent status. While the men went out and did things and sullied their hands women were above all of that. The effect of course was to limit what they did. gtWhat is its primary function socially politically economically legally etc? Who does it serve to benefit?This is going to be tautological but it benefits who it benefits. Its kind of pointless to talk about this one aspect of gender roles on its own to be honest. Like other gender roles generally it rewards people who are willingabledesiring of living up to them and punishes people who are not. gtAnd what if anything at all does feminism as a movement have to do with the empathy gap?Feminism is not a monolith. There have been plenty of feminist movements through the years that to some degree or another have pushed back against the empathy gap. But what were seeing with the modern NeoFeminist movement is a traditionalist movement that is based off of the concept that the empathy gap isnt being respected enough and we need to be doing that more. That we need to be caring much more about women than we do men. ,FeMRADebates,com30e9,11,t5_2y44v

Not mentioning it basically leaves it as the elephant in the room because the fact that mens issues receive so little recognition is itself a mens issue. And as well mentioning the onesided views on gender equality is a good opportunity to explicitly say that I dont agree with the people who take a onesided view and dismiss the existence of womens issues.What section were you thinking of in particular?

3184204,0,t3_2wlu66,. Occasionally you see similar rhetoric on MRM forums and even mentions of white people being oppressed.. Its a good way of insulting MRAs.,FeMRADebates,cos1jla,16,t5_2y44v
3191473,0,t1_cossbg7,Yeah I get what you mean. I used to be a feminist but I was turned off by similar behavior notably by my sister. She would always make it out like there was some godgiven morally required thing I had to do or way I had to think. She always made it seem like thered be a light at the end of the tunnel where I was a good guy deserved approval or whatever. But that never came. It was always manipulative bullshit that got me self loathing and feeling like a real shit head. At some point I just didnt feel like approval was the kind of thing I could deserve even in principle because there was always something about me usually an accident of birth that made me some sort of scum. And then came the day when I stumbled across the manosphere for the first time. I hated them so much thinking they were the most misogynistic scumbags in existence. I thought we were finally getting men to think like I was and we were on track to getting those men like me to think the magic way I should have been doing all the time and then these MRAs were off ruining it for everyone and setting us back. I spent about two years arguing with them but eventually they just had sources and I found myself unable to really make any key points without begging the argument that the feminist lens of thinking was the one true way to do it and that feminists had stumbled across the real root of gender dynamics. Without that initial assumption I was hosed without arguments or statistics so I joined the MRAs. They never shamed me told me there was more to do they never demanded unrealistic ways of thinking or any of that.When I told my sister about it we got into a huge fight and agreed not to have a relationship anymore. Weve spoken once in the past year only only to tell each other to go fuck themselves. I suspect there are a lot of men in the position that I was in and theyre getting emotional abuse disguised as politically progressive and correct liberal thinking. I really do think its abusive due to the effect it had on me even if Im not sure theres any conventional definition of abuse that my story would conform too. Thats a lot of why I choose to speak out against feminism.,FeMRADebates,cosso1y,6,t5_2y44v

3201728,0,t1_cotsggo,gt But in the case where I am the ally I do recognize the need to put my wants and voice second to the people Im supporting.   I asked if gender should be different and if so why? I appreciate that you do that its important to listen to others in many discussions.  Youll get many answers on why gender is different but heres mine gender is almost always treated as malefemale and if youre not one youre the other.  Everyone is perceived to be at least one and society in general considers the people who fuzz the divide to be freaks.  Race on the other hand is not as immediate.  Many many more people go about their daily lives without ever thinking about race.  Multiracial people are common and accepted for the most part and certainly arent considered mentally ill the way trans or queer people are.  There are many problems still faced by racial minority groups dont get me wrong.On the other hand everyone feels affected by gender much more often.  Theres no biological harm in an allArabic group but an allmen group or an allwomen group is going to run into some reproductive kookiness.  Issues are also much more muddy on gender where women have a shitty gender role men will often have a related if better one.  Tangent our idea of whats better is often based on the hetero cis male gender role so thats to be taken with a grain of salt.  Men are often trapped in their rigid gender roles as well and often harmed often fatally.  Rigid gender roles are bad for both genders and while I lean towards saying theyre worse for women I recognize that men face some significant and pressing issues.  There are many men I care about who I dont want to watch suffer through them and basic empathy for my fellow humans tells me to want to help too.Where does this tie into discussing issues?  When discussing female issues I agree with you that males should have their eyes and ears open further than their mouths.  However its wrong to claim to be fore gender equality when youre telling half the planet to shut it.  Its fine to say youre working for women which will work for gender equality but to skip that step and say youre for equality for both genders while only letting one speak is wrong.This is pretty rambley but I hope it makes sense.,FeMRADebates,cotux2g,1,t5_2y44v

The official answer is in the article there is no test or requirement.But that makes sense. Michael Phelps isnt competing in the mens category. Hes competing in the anyone category. Anyone good enough can face off against him. If there was a nonmale person that wanted to compete in the mens category in the olympics they could do so.Unless the wording of the olympics rulebook is poorly done. But thats how things work in most sports. Women can play on the NBA  its not a mens group. Its an anyone group. It would be discrimination if a woman were good enough to play on the NBA and not allowed!Womens groupings in all sports are artificially created in order to allow for female representation in sports. Otherwise women would hardly exist in most forms of sports. womens groups are a recent decision that society decided upon. Their goal is to restrict people from the category. That does leave the problem of how to restrict people from it  the article shows how hard this is  but its a problem that mens groups dont have. They arent preventing anyone from playing there.,FeMRADebates,coylt3x,11,t5_2y44v

3345130,0,t1_cp9f2a5,The case of math is different because mathematicians arent studying anything about the real world.  When they look at an area where  they are only looking at that area and if it has consequences in the real world that is just gravy. If we look at math concepts applied to the real world there are plenty of alternative models and there can be serious consequences to which model we choose.It sounds like what you are saying is that words are socially constructed.  That is obvious. It shouldnt however have any implications on how we talk about things it only does because people are stupid and dont stick to the definitions of words.  We define sex a certain way and then tie in all our preconceptions about the word instead of just seeing what follows from the definition.  But that is just people being stupid.gtMost importantly that lack of different options means that there arent serious social stakes caught up in what conceptualization we choose.So basically everything is socially constructed but it is only important for sex and presumably some other things.  The claim that sex is socially constructed then is rather meaningless and the real claim you are making is that this social construction is important.,FeMRADebates,cp9kio7,2,t5_2y44v

But its certainly a lot closer than the following pictures of Batman which all depict him with toothgritted defiance. Jim Gordon gives a much clearer expression of emotional defeat but then hes not a superhero. Hes a protagonist and a good guy but the nature of superheroes roles basically demands that they continue to stand up to whatever challenges they face in a way that other characters dont have to. Not that they can never show any sign of weakness or defeat but the constraints of the role are much stricter.There are probably some people concerned about readers treating the cover as fetish material and there probably are some readers who do treat it as fetish material but this doesnt invalidate the concerns of people who feel that the cover portrays her in a way that artists generally dont portray people fitting into the role of superhero.,FeMRADebates,cpiw863,-4,t5_2y44v

3433650,0,t1_cpj1143,gtAnd what happened to this agonistic educational culture? After over two thousand years as the central element in education public verbal contest died out almost completely in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Instead of the oral argumentbased maledominated education of the pre period education post was much more interiorized irenic negotiative explanatory. The older methods of academic defense and attack died out with startling rapidity says Ong because of the entrance of women into higher education. Contestive combative educational methods that had worked satisfactorily for allmale schooling now came to seem violent vulgar silly. A man could attack another man verbally and was expected to do so but to attack a woman either physically or intellectually was thought ignoble. As more women entered colleges their influence both tacit and explicit caused the abandonment of the agonistic tradition and the evolution of less overtly contestive educational methods. Thus the educational structure we inherit an amalgam of newer irenic values and halfunderstood survivals from a more agonistic time in education.,FeMRADebates,cpjnu7u,2,t5_2y44v

You cant expect women to want to work in construction or the army or any such labortype job if the threat of sexual and gendered harassment against them is everpresent.That said every piece of legislation should be absolutely  genderneutral.

No whats racistsexist is letting these social conditions continue.There are zero black activists that insist that black culture leads young people into criminal behavior. They argue that the historical conditions of systematic oppression in this country that has denied socialeconomiccultural access to African Americans for the better part of five centuries has led some African Americans to engage in illegal activity as a response to that oppression in order to survive.

3812805,0,t1_cqqv7j5,This is precisely the point which the OP is trying to allude to.If I remember correctly a study showed most women who attempt suicide use methods that are... somewhat less than likely... to cause death. And sometimes they tell others about it in advance. The idea being that the suicide attempt isnt so much an actual attempt to kill oneself but rather a particularly extreme cry for help.Because our society will generally help women in pain.The same study I think showed that when a man chooses upon a suicide method the methods are far more likely to be moreorless guaranteed in actually killing themselves. Because our society generally doesnt help men in need  a man who needs help becomes unworthy of help by virtue of needing it he becomes a notrealman. The gender implication is that many womens suicide attempts are the Cry For Help kind and their cry will probably get answered. Whereas a mans suicide attempts are very much attempts to kill themselves because they know they wont get sympathy or help or anything like that.This can often be framed in very unflattering terms though and some people like to use it to talk about attentionwhore women or melodramatic women etc. This is an unfortunate twist in the discourse.

Nor did I appreciate gendered slurs like Mansplaining What About Teh Menz Manspreading Bropropriation and similar.Admittedly when I was unwantedly touched by a second woman as Mary Koss would say it and was then told repeatedly I should shut up about the topic because it was derailing from the real issue of women being assaulted I guess I took that a little personal.So yeah egalitarianism for me all the way.,FeMRADebates,crngp5l,69,t5_2y44v

4147903,0,t1_crrqbzh,gt Someone who is in a very unprivileged class might be way better off than someone in a privileged class. Does that actually say anything about them? No.This is not an argument. Someone who supports the privilege theory would say that outliers dont break the whole trend. For example there are many women who are stronger than an average man but on the whole most men are still stronger than most women. Take for example Saudi Arabia there are many women who are more powerful and have more freedom than most Saudi Arabian men but on the whole women there are still a lot more restricted than men.gt If you have on the other hand a collegeeducated bisexual black woman who is an executive on a certain company all the possible disadvantages that you could attribute to their characteristics are practically gone. That person has power and wealth and they certainly arent going to be discriminated against.Not really. Just because youre rich and powerful doesnt mean you cant be discriminated against or harassed because of your gender skin colour or sexuality. She might receive hate emails from people insulting her specifically on the basis of her gender skin colour and sexuality or very likely all three of them. It doesnt have to be actual discrimination it could simply be receiving hate or animosity not because of what you are like as a person or what you do but because of your genderracesexuality  traits that have nothing to do with what you are like as a person.One more thing which stands out to me is that many MRAs only deny the male privilege but accept the female privilege. They dont always call it privilege though and I think theyre right this word is just inaccurate in this case but they admit that women have certain advantages in societal treatment that have to do with them being women not their class or status. But then they deny that men also have certain advantages that have to do with them being men and not their class or status. This seems a tad hypocritical to me  in my mind its no better than feminists claiming that there are only advantages to being a man but only disadvantages to being a woman. The world isnt black and white. Our society isnt some horror show where all men are omnipotent overlords having infinite power and freedom and all women are oppressed slaves with literary no freedom or rights nor is it the other way around. Both being a man and being a woman has certain advantages and disadvantages in how theyre treated by society. But Id rather call it disadvantages and lack of disadvantages. For example not being trusted around children is a disadvantage but being trusted around children is not a privilege  not being automatically distrusted with children simply because of your gender shouldnt be seen as an advantage it should be seen as default. Lower than default  disadvantage. The word privilege refers to some extra rights and bonuses not a normal treatment that in ideal society everyone should be getting.,FeMRADebates,crt2r8d,1,t5_2y44v

4196736,0,t3_38ue8b,Here are a few based on various MRAs Ive seen here in this sub While its easier for men to gain respect than women its easier for women to gain sympathy than men. In order to bridge this gap in empathy we must encourage society to see women as capable of doing bad things and men as capable of being victims who deserve help and compassion. Although women do probably face disadvantages when it comes to wealth and power the empathy gap is far more important to address because it kills men via suicide incarceration conscription etc and makes it harder for male victims to get help.  Womens issues in the US are limited to lowlevel offenses like manspreading and catcalling and feminism is responsible for giving women a powerful platform to promote misandry by addressing these issues. Women and feminists have a victim complex. Meanwhile men are the ones who are really oppressed and have been throughout history. If women were oppressed theyd have less rights than men. In reality men have less rights than women who are the privileged class.  Any feminist concept privilege intersectionality the Bechdel test toxic masculinity is bullshit because it isnt based on logic or reason. Variance on an individual level disproves all of these theories. But female privilege and toxic femininity are probably real. Wheres the male version of the Bechdel test? Any womens issue touted by feminism can be disproved using logic. Any woman can easily obtain an abortion. The wage gape is caused by womens choices.

4219495,0,t1_cs167cn,Well I am a socialist feminist so I believe that markets are not natural but social forces and that capitalism is one of the the primary enforcers of womens oppression in modern society. It is not simply a coincidence that the lowestpaid and lowestprestige fields are dominated by women  women are socialized into these devalued but highly necessary roles. As for men doing maintenance and the like and the fact that they are her children as well its all about proportions. Sociologists have shown that even working women still do a disproportionate amount of domestic labor . Of course this is an improvement over the past where traditional gender roles were stricter. Still marriage tends to decrease womens happiness while increasing mens and while marriage is a boon to mens careers it harms womens  they work more because they are responsible for doing more unpaid labor but then they are said to be choosing to work less. All of these forces serves to disenfranchise women. Perhaps men feel like women have more power than them but feeling is different from fact.I think its disingenuous to suggest that rhetoric like femininity is frivolous while masculinity is heroic does not devalue one in comparison to the other. It infantilizes women and erases their contributions. I dont think thats a serious argument.

Anyway sorry again.gtIm not sure I understand...so individual feminists can only be expected to oppose mutilation and oppression if it can be framed as a feminist issue? Well Id never lay claim that I dont confuse people from time to time.  Still where do I imply such exclusivity?  Since you characterized my earlier post as stating feminists would have no other obligation to denounce circumcision apart from political gain again applying some serious reduction to my statements I wanted to clarify that while I acknowledge that deflecting politically motivated MRA criticism could be considered political gain  I didnt think that was Justins motivation or would even be the motivation of most feminists.It may help to restructure my conditional sentence as an ifthen statment gtIf they became exposed to the circumcision debate through forms of feminism that present circumcision as a feminist issue then Im willing to bet that sort of compassion is what would motivate most feminists who might become anticirc.My intent was to clarify what I consider a more likely motivation for individual feminists than political gain  compassion.  The reason I point out the method of introducing someone to the debate i.e. circumcision as a feminist issue is because thats the presentation in OPs link.  Currently people are largely exposed to the circumcision debate through intactivism or counterintactivism and intactivism may be making progress but most males in the US are still circumcised.   Why hasnt intactivism simply converted the masses feminist and otherwise if the morality is so black and white?  Some aspect of the argument must lack compulsion for people. For some feminists that might be pointing out where the issue stands as falling under the umbrella of feminism.  Which I think you would agree with Justin that circumcision is a feminist issue or you couldnt frame it as a form of hypocrisy?gtYou dont think humans are obligated to oppose unethical behavior? I only ask this because youve denounced circumcision so you must view it as unethical. You could say that you dont assume you know whats ethical but you didnt say that.I thought it was heavily implied by my having pointedly situated it as my viewpoint versus didactically presenting it as the objectively correct viewpoint.Note my wordsgtthe right side of the issue from my perspective. gtthat aligns with my woldview Ah well...  gtI disagree epecially in the case of feminism which is opposed to restrictive gender roles other genital mutilation sexual repression which is a main cause of the popularity of male circumcision gender inequality and infringing on bodily autonomy. Thats hypocrisy pure and simple and I think everyone is obligated to avoid hypocrisy lest they be open to criticism. gtYou dont agree thats grounds for criticism?My original comment apparently implies that MRAs consider feminisms nonstance on male circumcision a political weapon you stated that I was characterizing an anticircumcision stance as a political defense for feminism and I said thisgtAre there areas of hypocrisy re feminism and circumcision? Yes.So... Yes. I think theres a basis for criticism at least.  If they wanted to to avoid this form of criticism then I suppose feminism would be obligated to adopt the stance but I think were just going back to my original comment on this which you seemed to take umbrage with.  gtAnd yet they dont have a problem seeing the flaws in and opposing other gender norms that have been drilled into our heads since birth.Dont they?  Justin does explicitly frame circumcision as a feminist issue in OPs link. I would still characterize feminism as largely on the fence but Im sure grateful to see these signs of change.gtDo you parents have the sole mission of opposing inequality and oppressionEr accepting that feminisms sole mission is to oppose inequality and oppression no thats not any given parents vector for hypocrisy re circumcision as a parent.  Although I suppose that would still apply to egalitarians who I also dont think of as universally anticirc. For parents it would stem from the protection and guardianship they would profess for their children right before choosing cosmetic surgery right out of the womb if you view things from my perspective.  For the medical association it comes in opposition of the words of the hippocratic oathgtI will apply for the benefit of the sick all measures which are required avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism. gtI will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science and that warmth sympathy and understanding may outweigh the surgeons knife or the chemists drug.Again if you view things from my perspective.

This isnt about my reliance on private property its about the limitations of free speech and where it actually applies. A restaurant can ask you to leave if youre causing a disturbance to other customers because... its their property and their rules. They have no authority to dictate your conduct in a public place but when youre on their property they have the authority to ask you to leave or stay.Take any amount of examples you want to but theres a categorical difference between discriminating against physical racial or otherwise nonbehavioral traits that humans have and an individuals personal conduct.gtBut on an internet discussion forum I am fine with passengers saying what they have to say since that is what speech is for.No its not. The internet forum is for whatever the owner of the internet forum decides its for. I assume you clicked a little box that said you agree to the terms of the site in question. That click shows that they not you or the userbase are the proprietors and owners of the site and have the authority to regulate content at their discretion.Furthermore what an internet forum is for is a meaningless distraction. Theres no objective function of a discussion forum. Do you for instance have a problem with subreddits being moderated at all? Do you object to subreddit moderator and creators banning individuals in order to maintain the reason why they themselves created the sub in the first place? The reality is that just like all other rights and freedoms there are conflicts between them and through those conflicts we see the limits of where each and any right lies. Free speech doesnt trump everything in all circumstances and this just happens to be a case where it doesnt. Moderators and site owners have the power and authority to direct and regulate conduct as they see fit you know why? Because theyre the ones paying for the domain and the servers and the staff and its their money and finances that are funding your ability to discuss something. And this becomes even more asinine and ridiculous when we consider the fact that we dont as users pay for the service that they provide. There is absolutely no leg for anyone to stand on here other than to say I dont like it. Nobody can say its wrong nobody can say its against speech because it completely misconstrues and misinterprets what free speech actually is and where its applicable.

The sort of individual who kills people with some sort of malice likely has a mental issue as it seems very unlikely that any normal person would kill someone  empathy alone should suffice in most cases.gtIt could be that despite how vitriolic their racism is they realize that killing someone in this day and age is hard to get away with and even if they didnt get sent to prison their name would be blasted on mass media and things would suck.Or that they just have some measure of empathy. I mean its one thing to hate someone its another thing to want them dead and its another to want to kill them yourself. The sort of individual who wants to kill someone else out of malice again likely has some sort of mental issue as the average normal individual doesnt have such a desire  or at least such a desire that theyll act upon.At best we can definitely say that an individual that kills people without regard for the consequences is likely either suicidal or has some other issue present.gtAre all of the police officers whove killed unarmed black people this year mentally ill or simply predisposed to perceiving threats when interacting with black people?However again this isnt a fair comparison. Cops arent known for routinely going to a church and shooting  people dead. If they did wed mostly likely get them a mental screening.gtWhat Im reading is that all of these people you dont perceive to be acting rationally are somehow experiencing mental illness which would be unfortunate for multiple reasons but primarily because what you consider reasonablerational is not a universal standard. Im sure Ive misinterpreted your view a bit so feel free to give me a more nuanced explanation.I am not a medical professional with regards to mental illness however it is very clear that sane people people not suffering from mental illness have at a massively lower likelihood of going out and killing other innocent people. As social creatures we have to at least heavily dehumanize a group of people before were willing to act on killing them.So sure some people could become mass murderers and not being suffering from mental illness although unlikely but if thats the case then what do we do to prevent or minimize the threat? Ban anything can could trigger an individual? I mean whats the solution? Ban guns for everyone because one dickhead decides to use his improperly? Ban video games because the news made some connect the dot sensationalism and because it was easy as video games are an easy target? Do we ban anyone from having a thought that isnt in line with what we deem as safe?Or do we instead pragmatically recognize that the vast majority of mass murderers that arent religious zealots have at the very least likely had some sort of mental illness?We do not fund mental health. We barely fund medical needs.So on one side we have a giant gaping hole that is mental health and treatment and on the other side we have everything else that ends up as an easy scapegoat because we want to feel safe and the news wants to sell stories.gtIf the culture youre born into teaches you that other people are lesser and tainting your qualify of life and threatening your loved ones that really isnt any different than the ideas that cause one to view the West as abhorrent.Yea... except they arent blowing themselves up into building or entering a public location and opening fire.Its likely that were going to disagree on the prime motivating factor of what youd remove if you could remove just one thing to prevent the situation and what would be the most effective one thing to remove. I say lets remove the question of mental health. At a minimum weve provided mental health needs and still have mass murderer problems. Removing guns for example doesnt stop the mass murderers it just makes their plans harder and more elaborate and it also doesnt help the mentally ill get treatment as a byproduct.gtAbsolutely. I dont really want to get into gun control but my opposition to the more guns! argument is that it doesnt address the reasons why these things happen.Does the motivation for a killing matter more than the act itself? Is the why as important as it is that someone went out and shot other people? If we removed the motivating factor and someone just went out and killed a bunch of people just because what do we do in that situation? Can we really say without doubt that someone like the male in OPs story did what he did because of racism specifically or was that just one aspect or even just a coverup or a rationalization? Would he have done it had he not been racist? Id guess probably not but we cant really say. The sort of individual however who acts on such a plan and kills  people probably has problems and those problems likely arent being addressed.I mean even if it was racially motivated and mental illness wasnt a factor how the hell do you solve that? Treating mental illness has a path a plan a goal. Treating racism is near impossible. Youd be fighting a good part of human nature for a specific minority to not hate on some other group for a shitty reason.gtThatd be nice but there dont exist any illnesses that increase the likelihood of someone being violentSchizophrenia is often associated with violence. Whether or not thats the case is up in the air. Still I recognize fully that not all mentally ill individuals are violent. However those that are end up shooting up a high school in the case of the specifically sociopathic shooter of Columbine.gtthey could panic when faced with resistance in a robberyWhich isnt a deliberate killing. Theyre there for a robbery not specifically to kill a bunch of people.gtthere are millions of reasons someone could commit an act of ridiculous violence that arent because theyre mentally ill. Yes but were talking about the specific case of an individual going to a location with nothing more than the intent to end as much life as they can.The reasons for doing so could be varied but even a gang member that shoots up a rival gangs location is likely suffering from their own forms of psychosis such as antisocialpersonality disorder or something else due to likely being abused their whole life.,FeMRADebates,cscr1ve,3,t5_2y44v

You can only legitimately make the case that the nature of the effect changes depending on the gender when gender and the effect come as necessarily related such as in the case of physical effects of pregnancy.But that doesnt hold here because it would have to hold that no men could feel objectified or be objectified by such a shirt if it objectifies women.  That simply is not plausible in the slightest.  So no that argument simply wont work here.gt Again noticing that certain messages may affect a particular gender differently is not an indication of any kind of centrism.It simply doesnt work out that no men get affected by negative messages that get transmitted via shirts or other forms of communication.  For the love of Pete defamation laws have existed since the time of the Roman empire   And there exist plenty of cases where those laws were to protect men.  Thus you simply cant reasonably maintain that if spoken or written messages can affect women negatively that they cannot affect men negatively.  Therefore if a shirt like the one mentioned can affect women negatively then it can also affect men negatively and conversely.  That is not to say that such a shirt does affect women negatively or that it affects men negatively in a significant respect just that if such can happen to one gender it can and will happen to some members of the other gender.  And that comes as all that is needed here because the dean excluded all men in what she said.gt Editorializing the title is just needlessly inflammatory. It is NOT editoralizing to use accurate terms.  It is accurate here that the comment of the dean was gynocentric.gt Advocating for an issue that women face  even it being something potentially subjective like sexual objectification  is not actually straying from that. It is straying from an egalitarian world if one gender gets excluded.  And here men did get excluded.gt She represents all students and all those students will face different issues based on their gender their ethnicity their physical or mental abilities their socioeconomic status and so on. Singling out one group with respect to one incidentissue is hardly a problem.No.  Actually singling out one group when it affects another group consists of the problem when talking about an issue at the public level such as that of a public university dean.  It indicates that identity comes as more important than working towards resolving the problem.  It is not.  The importance of making things better with respect to the issue is more important than the identity of some of those affected by the problem.Singling out one group indicates one group as more worthy of attention than another.  That is not the case.  All groups affected by the problem should get helped and such an attempt to help all groups is not helped by signaling out one group.gt So if youre only talking about males are you doing a disservice to women? At the level of a dean at a public institution yes ones personal life is potentially different given of course that the issue also affects women which whatever it is it almost surely does exceptions may exist but that is all they are... exceptions.  Not necessarily for everyone on campus of course but for a dean who gets expected to represent everyone on campus yes.  Signaling out groups based on identity is a problem when you have the responsibility of representing the needs and interests of everyone as much as can get done.  ,FeMRADebates,csiy7qm,7,t5_2y44v

An unconscious person cannot consent. Articles that use this argument in support of affirmative consent are only using it as a scare tactic. Being incapacitated is little more of a grey area since people define at what point a person becomes incapacitated differently. In regards to alcohol some people think  drink removes the ability to consent others believe anything short of passing out is fine. I think what advocates of affirmative consent are looking for is a definitive spoken yes for consent to be achieved. Where I think some advocates are going to far is that they want a definitive spoken yes at each stage of the fucking process. Is it okay if I hold your hand? Is it okay if I kiss you?

However women generally arent taught or encouraged to prepare for it and handle it the same sorts of ways men are generally taught and encouraged to prepare for and handle physical and psychological ordeals.  Women also tend to regard it the experience of unmedicated childbirth afterwards as this defining epochal moment in their lives which of course it is as for many women its one of the very few if not the only times in their lives that they were actually tested to the limits of their physical and psychological endurance combined.

4464447,0,t1_cste7iu,gt No it isnt. Equality doesnt care about traditional male goals it cares about equality.But if you only look at traditional male goals when measuring inequality you get a very lopsided view of things.In our current society the following are advantaged Men who perform traditional masculinity and value traditionally masculine aspects of life. Women who perform traditional femininity and value traditionally feminine aspects of life.Im not advocating that this is how it should be. Im pointing out that the problem is not that women are disadvantaged. Its that women are expected to perform traditional femininity and face greater difficulty in pursuing in traditionally male aspects of life while men are expected to perform traditional masculinity and face greater difficulty in pursuing traditionally feminine aspects of life.gt the assumption in your argument is that they are that way for a some kind of biological or intrinsic reason rather than because of anything else.Absolutely not. Nothing in my argument has relied on the assumption that these advantages and disadvantages are due to intrinsic differences between men and women.Its society which punishes men for femininity and women for masculinity and hiders women in pursuit of masculine desired and men in pursuit of feminine desires. Thats the game we are all playing. The rules suck but not because they are unbalanced against one gender in particular.gt How have they done this?By treating traditionally masculine goals authority and career as if they were the only important things in life. The assumption of a great deal of feminist rhetoric is that if you lack authority or career success then your life is objectively worse. It ignores all of the aspects of life parts I personally find more important than authority and career  in which women are better off than men.gt in fact part of their argument is that femininity isnt socially valued as high as masculinity is.The performance of femininity not feminine values and preferences. Many feminists will argue that feminine traits are undervalued in masculine aspects of life. They say little on the feminine aspects of life.gt To be honest given your last paragraph you really should want more equality between the sexes as it would likely be in your selfinterest.It is. I would love for gender norms to be completely torn apart. I however do not believe that pretending women are objectively disadvantaged will help in that goal.

Feel free to PM me or respond to this when you do.gt Why should I care? And what should I do about it? are the questions I try to ask of everything. You answered the first but Ive yet to get a satisfactory answer for the latter. As for cultural attitudes I believe in baby steps. The discussion is important but expectation that itll cause change overnight is misplaced.I dont know of anyone over college age who is involved in social justice work that expects anything to change overnight. They tend to be more like me. I believe that radical cultural criticism is important but history and personal experience tells us that change and progress is very very gradual and not always linear. However history also tells us that such criticism and dialogue is effective in changing cultural attitudes about certain things and getting people to think more critically about how their behavior impacts others. So Im not sure where youre getting this expectation of dramatic sea change.gt Data that demonstrates that changing the workplace social systems would not only bring in more women but maintain workplace efficiency and effectiveness. As I said Ive saved your comment to come back to later to see what they have to say on the subject. Id love to work for a more diverse company but I dont want to work for a company thats too busy navel gazing not saying that women navel gaze more than men to get anything done I already get enough of that in the big company culture Im currently lodged in.What if this just means having a workshop once a year for three hours who cares? I think openly discussing gender issues amongst coworkers is one of the most radical changes you can make in a workplace as these issues are so frequently ignored or swept under the rug. I dunno about you but I am much more open to having my mind changed about things by people who I am close to that I trust intellectually and emotionally. Although that definitely doesnt describe everyone I work with lololol I think giving a space for people to openly discuss these issues is really important.

4473509,0,t1_csuac9g,gt Yes dont you think men are kind of cultural default. If someone is nongendered and present no gender signifiers for example on the internet in a pseudonymous forum like this one that its naturally assumed theyre male?Kind of but thats not my point. Theres this problem with a mostly binary system where you cant really distinguish being a member of A from NOT being a member of B. So in this case I treat everyone that way is the only defense against I only treat women that way. But since cis men do not largely observe women without men around and visa versa no one is really qualified to use personal experience to explain gendered phenomena without evidence to refute I treat everyone this way. Hence science.gt...anything having to do with implicit bias...Well clearly there are IATsbehavioral studies which show implicit biases affecting explicit ones I just havent seen one for this behavior. Something like this might also be second order where gendernorm conformity will correlate with gender role acceptance which will correlate in men to academicallydefined sexist values.gtThe main bulk of what you saidAh... the question of social ethics arises here. See as we define cultural values to have moral worth an obstruction then becomes a moral problem. People do not want to accept that they themselves or the ones they love are immoral so you must either deconstructqualify they moral system or accept that most everyone is pretty evil. But even aside from that youre also left with the effective vs ideal debate. If a lie advances a cause can it be justified in being told? I tend to say no because those personal biases you mentioned means that no one is truly qualified to make such decisions from a position of moral authority. But if a truth say that a common male behavior is an indicator of implicit sexism causes direct harm to the cause can it be omitted from most discussions? That Id say yes for the same reason that the person advocating it cannot be sure their biases are not making them judgmental.Personally I  take it probably too far towards the utilitarianlibertarian side where social justice cannot be a moral value but merely a collective value of individual interactions which may be good or bad and the actual moral evaluation comes under an understanding of circumstance. But as far as Im concerned thats the only robust solution. This is why I think social justice is not a valid ideal per se even though justice is a thing to seek in society. This leads me to conclude that if in general you are criticizing people beyond what their direct actions merit and intentionality is part of that you have overstepped. Thats not to say you cant point out harmful behaviors but it is to say that you cannot apply moral weight and by extension should not use terms which carry such moral evaluation. Consequently I cant really agree that impact truly overrides intent in how we should respond to a deleterious impact. Intent is part of that impact because the people who are causing that impact are just as much people as the ones they are impacting and their intent matters to them.Im not really arguing for that here just explaining my position.

For example there are highly influential strains of poststructuralist feminism that explicitly reject the idea of feminism as securing increased rights freedoms or political representation for women as well as rejecting the concept of women as a coherent ontological category in the first place and there are political activist strains of feminism explicitly predicated on securing increased rights freedoms and political representation for women.gtIf everyone who uses the word feminism has a different and unrelated meaning in mind then it seems as though the word would be useless for communicationI dont think that everyone has different and unrelated meanings clearly many people are indicating the same thing when they say feminism and many different meanings of feminism have substantial overlaps or interrelations.

Read my other response above because I believe they answer some of the points youve brought up here. Namely that intersectionality answers why many men occupy lower rungs of society due to social class race sexuality etc.I can empathize with the fact that colloquially the term privilege connotes in some instances something of a perjorative meaning. However I do not find this reason enough for rendering the term outright useless. Its important to recognize how the meaning shifts in certain contexts. In the context of social theory I find that the term can be used meaningfully and with precision in reference to a specific concept. Many people use the phrase begs the question wrong for example as in to say something literally begs us to ask a particular question. This isnt enough for philosophers to abandon the term though when they use it to critique an argument for being circular and understand this meaning clearly within their own context. ,FeMRADebates,cta1yun,3,t5_2y44v

Remember this is back before antibiotics so any policy of legalizing prostitution had to have some mechanism in place to make sure it wasnt going to create a huge disease epidemic.Which by definition meant you could not be compliant with the law if you didnt have a vagina to get regular inspections.I think they were fairly recently going to update the laws amp regulations on order to let men be prostitutes legally for the first time but I dont know if they ever finalized the idea or not.gt Its not as if male prostitutes dont exist at all.This is true but it was a niche market comparatively. Politicians in general tend to think only of the obvious and niche markets fall between the cracks.InB someone says but male homosexuality was criminalized I realize this is the case but there are and presumably were at the time heterosexual male prostitutes in addition to gays.,FeMRADebates,ctf2f4z,2,t5_2y44v

Even if we ignored the issue of age failing to correlate with support for genderegalitarianism as expected modernization still has to deal with the uncomfortable fact that support for democracy has not correlated with support for gender egalitarianism.While Kostenko Kuzmichev and Ponarin essentially frame this as Arabs getting democracy wrong As emancipative values are shared by only a small minority we cannot expect a shift towards liberal democracy in the Arab world in the near future... If equal rights arenot considered to be a part of the democratic system we should be very suspiciousabout the claim that the majority of the Arab population strives for democracy.  p. I think that the key takehome point is that modernization and even democratization in countries that dont have a postChristian history does not necessarily look like it does throughout much of Europe and the Americas. While theories of modernization have posited a linear progression from authoritarian and theocratic modes of governance to Westernstyle liberal secular ones many countries without the unique history of Christianity often instead shifted attitudes towards a more democratic system that does not favor the expected secular Westernstyle egalitarian perspectives that emerged in the postChristian West. ,FeMRADebates,ctje7n8,2,t5_2y44v

One of the reasons why there are fewer men in college is because more of them go to trades school army etc whereas a huge chunk of college students are humanities and social scienc students mostly female that likely wont have as good employment opportunities.

The result is that they both are able to retreat into the shelter of They just think that... and dont understand.... When such a complex issue becomes so clear cut black and white we should all take a step back so we can smell the bullshit emanating from both sides.gtI dont interpret it that way. They are just distinguishing between shortterm and longterm measures. Sure the fact that this street is dangerous needs to be addressed but this will probably take years. Its a longterm project.I dont think so. At least thats not what Im trying to say. Its more a difference of context than anything else and whether or not the response actually falls in line with our notions of equality. If I say something like Women have to not drink as much as men to not get raped it falls well outside of the desired goal of gender equality. So if your goal is gender equality the answer falls drastically short as women are forced to behave differently than men in order to not get raped at higher levels than men. So if equality is your aim the answer is disastrously insufficient. On top of this the answer is treating the symptom more than its treating the disease. The advice is hardly ever offered on a casebycase basis its a general Dont wear this and do this and well have no more rapes kind of advice. Consider the outcry that would happen if we did that for every other type of major crime. Do we automatically jump to You shouldnt have been cheating on your spouse if you didnt want to get murdered.? No we dont. Because we all realize that the transgression perpetrated by the victim is far below the action perpetrated against them to a significant degree. And why thats different for rape I have no idea. Its an egregious enough offense that we shouldnt have to take the victims behavior into account and doing so is  for the most part  to place an undue emphasis on the victims behavior while washing away culpability from the rapist. Thats what I fail to understand. Why its so important to have to say during any and all discussion involving rape. Its not about long or short term goals at least for me. Its very much about a different and alternate code of conduct for men and women thats undeniably conforming to mens inability to control themselves. I as a man understand that I can control my sexual urges so as not to commit rape. I also as a person understand that I can control my material needs so as not to commit theft. Ive also had plenty of tools stolen from work sites over the years but the response I get from everyone isnt you should lock up your tools even if they werent locked up. Its always a vilification of the theft itself and in most cases an anger that I  the victim  have to deal with getting new tools. So what I have to ask myself is why rape is so different? Why is it that a work site where tools are stolen regularly that the theft itself is treated with such disdain while rape is treated as the responsibility of the victim?The answer I suspect is that most everyone on the work site wants to be able to leave their tools without such a fear so they are sympathetic and their anger shows a contempt for the action itself.

If it did not present conceptual difficulty it would never end up as a question in court in the first place.  Say that the feelings of the person in question are not the determining factor as you say and the reasonable standard is applied. Then I ask again what threshold is overcome before something moves from unreasonable to reasonable? I mean this whole line of thinking is similar to the pornography supreme court ruling and the Ill know it when I see it argument.  If you cant explicitly define what causes something to move from irrational to reasonable then all you have it subjectivity masked as objectivity under the reasonable person standard.  It kind of just seems like saying something is illegal because a reasonable person would consider it to be so is like saying I cant come up with explicitobjective reasons much like the pornography case so Il just say I know reason and irrationality when I see it.  It just seems like a weak and lazy standard and more importantly in many areas of life there are real down the middle divides on what is or is not reasonable.  Combine the divide with the reasonable person standard and the average person really has no way of knowing if something they do is aok or is going to land them in jail.  So I ask another time in a different way if my wife were to walk out in a fit of rage tomorrow saying she is going to her sisters place and she never wants to seetalk me again and I wanted to save the marriage hypothetically speaking..my wife and i are doing great! if I were to text and call over multiple days or weeks or even perhaps show up at her sisters house in an attempt to talk it out would I be stalking her? I could see it being stalking..I mean she did say she never wanted to see me or talk to me after all but like I said Ive sen countless chick flicks with similar plot lines...so how am I to know if doing so is going to land me in jail or not?which leads to the ultimate point I think the purpose of jail is to punish committers of crime keep them away from society and to deter others from particular actions.

5158412,0,t3_3lnmh0,Just to preface my comment that exchange in the other thread was pretty enlightening and raised a lot of good questions. gtDo you think early sexed or giving more body autonomy to children will help clarify some of the weird issues our generation has with consent in a way thats productive and safe for all? I think that it certainly cant hurt. As with all things youd start with broad brush principles ask  wait for yes  then act etc and add greater granularity to what constitutes consent as they grow older implied incapacitation coercion etc. It doesnt even have to be in the context of sex which some of your more staid neighbours to the south might object to  consent and bodily autonomy and asserting bodily autonomy are things which is useful for everyone in nearly every social interaction.What Im worried about is the effectiveness of this kind of education against a backdrop where many adults dont understand consent very well themselves and more importantly are wont to infringe on childrens bodily autonomy on a frequent basis. Teachers come behind parents in the hierarchy of control and influence over the child by way of showing is stronger than telling if nothing else.Actually Im going to have to go back on the claim that it cant hurt. Against the backdrop above and with zero chance that CPS will take away children from parents who insist on forcing kids to give hugs or kisses it might even be counterproductive to teach the concepts of bodily autonomy in the school only to have them roundly violated in the home physical discipline dragging them out of toy stores the hugs and kisses to family because then youre introducing a black and white concept and having to teach kids that parents and adults have an exemption from bodily autonomy. And that might be disastrous if theres molestation going on because kids dont understand nuance and youve now taught them that parents dont need to respect their bodily autonomy. Kids have a pretty good subconscious grasp of whats ok and whats not but by teaching them this youll be overwriting that with a conscious idea that will fail to cover all the possibilities. Unless you want to forment rebellion by the grade school children against their parents.So now instead of kids who have a vague idea of bodily autonomy and consent and therefore possibly able to fit acceptable parents exemption between the gaps while still retaining an idea of whats not okay even from parents you have kids who have a definite knowledge of the concept getting used to the concept being violated at will by others until they turn  or so. I couldnt think of a better way to groom kids to lose respect for the concept if I tried honestly. Tldr The idea is good but has downsides which make me unsure of its net utility. ,FeMRADebates,cv7s44h,9,t5_2y44v

People play with the male gender identification sometimes in the same way that people play with the female identification. Theres nothing at all wrong with any of this.

There are many Paleolithic and Neolithic remains of women that have clear signs of death from violence. There have been plenty of human women sacrifices.

Why are costs going up so quickly? Why arent competitors offering daycare at a reasonable cost?On the face of it clearly hiring a caretaker for a single child should be expensive. Thats one person working fulltime. But if you take your child to a daycare center where there is  adult for say  children the ratio is probably even better than that then it should cost around  of that adults salary. Somewhat more due to overheads like rent and insurance and so forth but those should not make it worse than say  of an adults salary. In other words it should be profitable for a parent to work for a salary and pay just  of it for childcare.Yet this article and others say that it isnt  that its worth it financially to just take care of your own child.

How can a society be racist if no individuals within that society are racist?Im sure youd be willing to accept that society is racist really just means racist ideas are commonly accepted and acted upon by individuals within that society right?gtIf society is largely racist then programs that soften the blow of systemic racism are necessary. The argument youre making here is odd and a mischaracterization of my own. Just to reiterate hereIm not saying that individuals are inherently racist and they have no capacity to shed their racism. Okay but if most individuals within society are racist to some degree which is what society is largely racist logically entails wouldnt this imply that the individuals who design and administer the programs would likely be racist to some degree also? And wouldnt that run a risk of corrupting the programs?gtI think were using the phrase treating people the same regardless of race differently here. On an individual level it is certaintly possible and ideal to treat people the same regardless of race. Im not saying that white people need to start opening doors for black people and throw their coats on the ground so black people can walk over puddles. As far as everyday human interaction goes the colorblind approach is similar to an anticolorblind approach.Okay we basically are in agreement there. Colorblindness on the individual interpersonal everyday level is what we should be aiming for. gtWhat Im talking about applies to a systemic societal level. But the systemic societal level is a product of all of these interactions at an individual interpersonal level. The micro gives rise to the macro.gtSociety cannot treat people the same regardless of race because racial bias is ingrained in the systems in which individuals operate making colorblindness on an individual level irrelevant.  Take college admissions for example.I absolutely agree that formalized institutions where the ruleshabitsroutines are codified in lawsbylaws can certainly be systemically racist but the solution to that is for the individuals who constitute the institution to change the institutions codified lawsbylaws. In addition the sources you linked to seem to ultimately depend on individual biases causing the racism i.e. the unfair harshness of school discipline for example... individual teachers being harsher on certain ethnicities than others. Doesnt this imply that the solution is more interpersonal colorblindness?gtIt seems to me that colorblindness banks on the good intentions of individuals to fix a broken system. Well who else is going to fix the system? Only individuals act and all social systems are ultimately a product of individual actions. ,FeMRADebates,cvxsn1c,1,t5_2y44v

Look how radical it is!while in this one Feminist and philosophy professor Adle Mercier angrily dismisses professor Janice Fiamengo in the following quite heated exchange my emphasisgt Mercier Well I am a professor of philosophy  I am a Feminist  and I dont know what the hell you are talking about!!gt Fiamengo Have you never heard of any of the Feminists that I mentioned who make those hateful statements about men? Youve never heard of them?gt Mercier You can cherry pick Feminists Fiamengo Its not about cherry picking all over the place  ...With all this cherry picking going on it rather begs the questionWho is and who is not considered by the majority of Feminists to be onmessage to be part of the canon of Feminism and who is seen as being on the fringes the extremists who give the rest of the movement a bad name?Given that some key second wave but still relevant Feminist writers include Shulamith Firestone and Valerie Solanis it does seem that it must be quite a challenge to distinguish between those Feminists doing Feminism right as it were and the more extreme fringes.EDIT Fixed the link to the MercierFiamengo video,FeMRADebates,cw6rz72,8,t5_2y44v
5440183,0,t3_3pjjf2,A good talk but not necessarily the best Warren Farrell presentation Ive seen. I thought the lengthier one he did in Canada was better.I dont think his correlation between fatherlessness and the various bad outcomes for boys is necessarily as compelling as he does. The dad leaving and bad outcomes for male children could both be the result of one or more independent factors i.e. household poverty andor the mother being abusive.While I think Warrens story spoilers about not realizing he was talking to John Lennon was amusing I think it undercut his point a bit. Most men arent in that guys positions i.e. being a wealthy rock legend and cant make the decision he made to take a few years off to raise his son and have nearly the confidence he had that such a decision wouldnt materially impact his relationship with his mate.Now Im sure Warren would agree that there are unfair pressures put on men which restrict their choices  indeed thats much of his focus  but his anecdote didnt strike me as the message of hope he seemed to think.I dont mean to be entirely negative though. It was a worthwhile talk and I think Warren often makes insightful points.,FeMRADebates,cw71buf,9,t5_2y44v

5457239,0,t3_3psz7t,gt What does this say about the genders? Does it say anything at all? As a first point it would be worth interrogating which media you most often use to get your news and information.Example if you were only to read The Guardian and Salon.com for your news source you would be by turns angered and depressed by the perpetual inequities of society and the violence Western culture daily commits on the bodies of women and girls.A second point is that while your evidence is general and anecdotal it likely strikes a chord with most readers  the experiences you describe are likely to be recognisable more or less to most people here.What these descriptions say varies enormously  they could be used to prove that there are innate differences amongst men and women that there are evolutionary reasons as to why men and women behave in these ways that this demonstrates the damage cultural gender roles inflict on society as a whole etc. etc. etc.gt Are men socialized to deal with their problems in different ways? Are they naturally better at handling problems? My own feeling is that there is a genetic and evolutionary foundation to much of our behaviour but that culturally societies interpret these foundations with almost infinite variety. I further think that these different drivers are to all intents and purposes indistinguishable from one another in lived experience.gt Is this a better way to deal with problems  a pragmatic just handle itdeal with it attitude? This is unanswerable outside of specific contexts and situations where the kinds of behaviours you describe become salient.gt Does it point to any social deficiencies in how we view men? See answer to previous question.gt Is this an innate part of life for the majority of men? No or at least mostly not  as I said above I think there comes a point where it becomes difficult if not impossible to discern whether biological or cultural factors have the most influence on behaviour. gt Why do men just shoulder their problems whereas women have an entire social structural support? Can women learn anything from this? Is the way women deal with their problems better?I think you massively underestimate the extraordinary sacrifices some women are prepared to make for their partners their children their parents and friends.Motivations for verbalising experience are varied and some are undoubtedly driven by selfish concern  for example a woman shares an experience of trouble she is having with her partner in order to prompt other women to discuss problems with their partners. A positive altruistic interpretation says that this is sisterly cathartic empathetic. However it could just as easily be interpreted as a way for one woman to learn more about herself and her own position in the social order e.g. on hearing the stories of others a woman may think Well Helens obviously fucking up way more than Im definitely not getting screwed over like Jane is..That doesnt happen all the time but it does happen sometimes for sure and its hardly what Id call supportive.,FeMRADebates,cw97ppz,7,t5_2y44v

Though exceptions have to be made to understand how certain geneticnature traits will have a greater range of expression based on how they were raised. I think the biggest point to be made in the gender wars over what is actually truly different between men and women is in the idea of separating who a person is from what things they like or are into and that can be hugely affected by family friends culturesociety. And certain inborn qualities genetics would cause certain people to be more susceptible to those influences.

5490462,0,t3_3q938s,It always makes me sad when good relationship advice is wrapped up in bad articles like this because none of that was bad advice it was just poorly framed and expressed. Im going to do a gender neutral rewrite to show what I mean.You have to pick up after them.A good partner should share responsibility for the household. This means contributing to keeping the home neat and their part of the financial obligations. If you find your not only taking on their share of responsibilities but also covering for them when they drop the ball elsewhere it is a sign. Check to make sure your their partner not they caretaker.  .Talk of children or commitment brings panic to their eyes.If your partner isnt willing to discuss the future with then this is not a long term relationship. If you plan to be in a long term committed relationship then you both need to have clear exceptions of each other. If your partner isnt even able to have this discussion it is a sign they may have issues surrounding commitment. If a high level of commitmenteg marriage kids is what you desire in the near to middling future this could be a dealbreaker for you. .You incessantly nag.Similar to point  you want to be on the same page as your partner about your responsibilities. Nagging is a bad sign in general. It usually represents either a lack of trust in your partner your partners inability to be responsible or both. None of this is good in a healthy relationship. Start with a bit of selfreflection and make sure you understand your role in the issue. Why do you not trust your partner to do the tasks? Why dont they followthough? This is usually where you want to start the discussion..They avoid serious conversation.This goes back to point . Once your approaching looking at a relationship as long term andor committed you need to have clear exceptions. If your SO isnt willing to even have basic discussions about what you both want of the relationship they may not be able to give you they kind of relationship you want. A good partner should at least address some your concerns. .Their interests and friendships carry a middleschool vibe.Your partner not able to show maturity. That is they dont display an ability to prioritize their adult responsibility with entertainment or understand the consequences of their action. If your partner can not manage healthy alcohol habits or tell when their behavior is inappropriate without you. What their interest is isnt as important as how well they can express this interest in a healthy and adult way. ,FeMRADebates,cwdghes,8,t5_2y44v

Ive seen a movie with Gina Carano and that was the only action movie where a physical fight scene between a man and a woman didnt take me out of the movie completely.But why should being empowered even have to involve physical violence? One of the best female characters is Olenna Redwyne Diana Rigg from Game of Thrones. She uses cunning and manipulation rather than round house kicks yet has more agency than nearly all men around her. And the best male character from the seriesbook is not a famous warrior but a dwarf who has been bullied as his life and fights back with searing wit amp cunning.PS.

5544477,0,t3_3r2ikd,No its not paranoid look at the UN and the EU and the shannigan they are trying to pull.the simple fact is is that when some one tries to motivate the government via the vector we need to protect the women and children its never about the women and children and is either about there personal feelings or a power grabs... sometimes both.See what i find a lot of feminists get wrong about their concept of patriarchy is that they assume the patriarchy came out of malice. that is was system set up to give legal and social fuck you to women.except it wasnt it came out rhetoric  like we need to protect the women and children. well at certain point in order to guarantee safety you have to sacrifice freedom and since the responsibility of safety of women fell on men that means men had the power. if we look at islamic countries all those anti woman laws are actually set up to protect women. the protection of women in these societies falls onto the men. well men cant protect some one who is going to go running off out of their purview and in to danger. so they set up restrictive rules such as women need to wear burka why? to protect  them from men the male gaze.  women have to ask the man if they can work. Why because the eldest male of a house hold is finicaly responsible for the house hold even if they are just a boy including paying the womens taxes but her money is her money in its entire with out taxes taken out not the house holds money legally speaking. so it doesnt make sense to have her working if her money is her money and cant be used to fund the house hold. the restrictive nature of a women must be accompanied by a man is so she always has protection. this is the direction i fear the west will be heading in if certain feminists with a media megaphone keep playing the victim about well nearly everything apparently too is sexist now. women rights will be curtailed because they will need men government ironically to protect them or at least that is how it will be sold. and of course various restriction will also fall on men as well. and this is how you end up back at a traditionalist society with men in charge and responsible for everything. i am borrowing the idea albeit in a less polished form from Allison Tiemen utyphonblue but i think its a solid theory and a legitimate worry for how things could go if the larger feminist movement doesnt root out the the professional victims andor victim feminism from its movement or at least wrestle the megaphone out of its hand. which from my albeit limited perspective appears to be large swaths of the third and forth wave of feminism. If i were feminist or in some power position with in feminism i would be fighting with all my might against this selling of fear and this notion that the world is out to get you in some unique way by men because you are a woman and encourage and push women to be less risk adverse which would have a lot of side benefits  like empowering women in the actual sense of what empower means to take on more pwoer and the corresponding responsibility.I will leave you with a quote from camila pagliathe risk of freedom is rape it is from an interview which she talks about sexual freedom and how she views modern college age feminist as squandering it or looking to give it up out an exaggerated fear of men and sex.i take that it in both the literal and metaphoric sense that the cost of freedom is risk of harm.and some food for thought ,FeMRADebates,cwkcdom,32,t5_2y44v
5547715,0,t1_cwkdbd2,Not all views are inherently bigoted.   Those with less extreme notions and less absolute certainty that they have all three answers are more likely to look for common ground.  That is assuming they have good intentions.  As with all politics identity politics are fundamentally selfish.  Feminism benefits women theocracy benefits Christians well for most of the world it actually benefits Muslims these days but specifically for the west Christians are the ones trying to make their religion law.The extent to which atheism takes w religious form I think is very limited.  Those who lack a belief in deities and those who are Richard Dawkins are very different.  The latter is more ideological which is a better term than religion as it describes the problem that it has in common with religious groups and other political factionsbut in the whole they organized atheist groups lack real political force or authority.   Something that cannot said of either feminist or religious groups.  For bigotry that sunset yes.  They absolutely do have a tendency to look down on religious idiots and believe themselves to be superior.  I would take issue with the notion that egalitarianism has a bigotry problem.  This is Tautologically precluded really.   There may be some negative sentiment towards feminists and similar identitypolitics groups... But that is largely reactionary sentiment to the way such groups address the notion of egalitarianism.... Which is understandable since in many way egalitarianism is a criticism of identity politics.   But that is more about disenfranchisement than anything it doesnt translate to misogyny racism or traditionalism.   In fact quite the opposite take the concept of egalitarianism to its logical conclusion and youll find capitalism economic and ethnic inequality and the disproportionate global standard of living to be very... Problematic I dislike that word but it fits.  Personally call me crazy here but I think these are more pressing issues than men taking up too much space because of the way they sit on public transportation or how sexually charged Halloween costumes objectify women.

IMO feminism treats men like Christianity treats gays. Sure there are feminist that dont hate men probably most. just like most Christians dont hate gays. then you start moving along the spectrum toward the i dont hate the sinner I hate the sin types or the i dont hate men i hate masculinity types who basically hate everything about you but no they dont hate you.... then you move further still along the spectrum to the point where you reach  brand of feminism saying all men are rapist and child molester in waiting or the Christians saying gays are child molesters and sodomites. ironically this is where some feminists and some Christians meet and you get some feminists saying gay men are more misogynistic than straight men because they arent attracted to women.In the same way the hard core christian right has found its way to the top of the GOP the hard core radical feminists have found there way into academia the legislature the media the judiciary and the health and human services areas of government.    its why i dont care for rule . effectively there is only one brand feminism that maters for any form of discussion on gender policy and media narrative and that is the brand of feminism which has the power to affect change. and that happens to be the brand of feminism thats in power. and the brand of feminism that is in power is not this nice lets all sing kumbia and have a love in.  it not about women issues though they will happily use them as bludgeon or changing the gender paradigm though they will happily use it to shame men in to compliance its about perpetuating the need for more of its brand feminism. it garners money from the government through victim services awareness campaigns sorry im not sorry but dont be that guy is bigoted and so area lot other awareness campaigns and rigging stats to make it seem like there is a larger problem than their actually is. your personal brand of feminism doesnt matter what matters is the institutional brand of feminism and what it wants.To the mods this post clearly delineates between differing sects of feminism and does not generalize  feminism or any other identifiable group. ,FeMRADebates,cwmqxvj,1,t5_2y44v

Now that might just be because she does all the household spending so the point is moot but there does also appear to be a thread involved where one could say that at least with some women men are treated as ATMs and little else.Still It seemed somewhat compelling especially given that I simply hadnt heard it before.At the end of the day though my main objective with regards to ideology and gender issues the core value if you will is to remain fair and objective about the information and arguments presented. That said presenting a link doesnt necessarily mean I endorse it even if that is a common thought.Simply put I thought it was interesting. It seemed certainly worth challenging but also worth some thought in some cases.Im not sure that we could really break down every issue so simply although perhaps Ill try to do so in the future.

Heres a link to video footage of a white pastor being tased and forcibly removed from his car for failing to provide identification at a constitutionally ambiguous and paradoxically named internal borderpatrol checkpoint.   Heres a link to a story about a white teenager who was arrested and held in jail for months on account of a sarcastic comment on Facebook..   Heres a link to a short news piece from a couple of years ago. It includes policecam footage of a black cop roughing up a Hispanic kid while another white cop stands by and does nothing..   Heres a link to one of many articles about that incident where a SWAT team threw a flash grenade into a crib and almost killed the infant inside of it..    Heres a link to the infamous dont tase be bro incident in which a  very clearly nonviolent young white man is held down and tased by a racially and gender diverse group of law enforcement personnel while a room full of people watch and do nothing.. Heres a link to a Young Turks segment which includes a video clip of the police response plot spoiler it involves batons to student protesters at the University of California at Berkeley. This was one of many instances of police brutality as a response to protests associated with the Occupy movement.Honestly I could go on for hours and hours so Ill just stop now before I work myself into a frenzy.I think that this problem has much more to do with unchecked authoritarianism and a lack of concern for basic human dignity.

Right at the end of the program someone finally brought up the issue of male victims using his own experience as a male victim of a female perpetrator. The panel immediately derails the question starting with the first guy who seems to start off okay in talking about minority voices when it comes to victims of DV but he quickly makes it clear by minority voices he doesnt mean men he still means women. In this case women who have been victims of their teenage sons. I mean seriously what the fuck!?

If you actually did read it you seen it said its a relief from debt not forgiveness of debt.  Meaning your debt by no means goes away once you file for bankruptcy despite what you think otherwise.  Let me quote the FTC themselves on what Chapter  is in summaryChapter  known as straight bankruptcy involves the sale of all assets that are not exempt. Exempt property may include cars workrelated tools and basic household furnishings. Some of your property may be sold by a courtappointed official  a trustee  or turned over to your creditors. In otherwords the people you owe money to are able to collect on all sales of non exempt assets to collect on what debt you owe.  The FTC itself says you are wrong here.  You also comically left out Chapter  as well which is the other most common used bankruptcy protection.gtHow does BI prevent people from gaining capital?I take it you never ask for a bank loan before or that know how that works?

You explained to me once and only after I hound you repeatedly.  Your answer also makes zero sense at all on top of that. gtOne reason is likely that the EU makes it much harder to fire people. It may also be cultural.Its neither.  Its because they are so heavily tax it deters more from starting a business than starting one in the US.  It is also because of their accounting system they use which maximizes profits so businesses can be tax more than that in the US.  As the US accounting system maximizes expenses so businesses pay lower amount of taxes.  Basically put due to all of the welfare systems in the EU they created an antibusiness environment.

5857104,0,t3_3vgjhh,gtI know I probably shouldnt generalise the whole sub but the comment section on last post about this incident seemed almost universally convinced that it was a false accusation.I would disagree. I think most people were skeptical. The top comment was saying that it may have happened and it may not have.I still take the same stance in that I want to see it taken to court rather than have me and the public make some judgement about him and his character. However I will say that Im inclined to believe that he did at least attack one of these women if not all based upon the quantity of reports.One woman comes forward? OK well its possibly character assassination but we should wait to see the results.Six women? OK well thats sounding a lot worse than it did moment before. I still have to ask why no one went to the damn police though. I know that some people are afraid and I even get that when it was just Stoya I was more skeptical. Still thats also  more women that have been attacked and if true some of those attacks could have been prevented or we could have had fewer of them attacked had it been reported and taken to court. And Im not saying that theyre responsible for the other girls being attacked but that we could have potentially stopped at least one of these women from being attacked  again assuming all this is true which sounds increasingly more likely.edit At least one of these women is claiming that Deen was being excessive and pushing limits she wasnt ok with and on a Kink set. That could have been prevented had the reports happened as Kink dropped him right after Stoyas accusation  and given their need for trust etc. in their particular genre it makes sense that theyd take that accusation seriously and even that theyd take it more seriously than perhaps other companies might have.I recognize that people lie and for various reasons among them is malice. I also recognize that that theres conceivable ways in which they could collude to attack Deen however I find that unlikely. I could also conceive of other interests that could use the accusations by these women as a means of attacking Deen but that works its way into conspiracy theory.Instead Ill stick with I dont know and I want to see it brought to court but it looks really really bad regardless.If none of these six women pursue legal action on this however I am far sooner going to assume that its a character assassination. We have a legal system for a reason and while its meant to protect people and correct for injustice it cant do that if the case is never taken to court  leading me to believe that its a lie for malicious reasons because they know its not true and wouldnt win in court.Still though... six women? Sounds shady as fuck.Edit Also...gtAsked about the descriptions given by the actors a spokesman for Kink.com said in an email to Vocativ that he couldnt speak to the specifics of this shoot without further checking but added The reason Kink adheres to the Model Bill of Rights so strongly is to prevent those types of lines from being crossed. On a large shoot not everyone is always aware of every interaction. Thats why Kink gives performers but also every person on crew the right to call the safe word red and stop a scene at any time. He later confirmed that Deen was ejected from the shoot.Speaking more generally If you are given a tool to stop someone from harming you and you are being harmed in a way that you dont agree to use that damn tool. You have a responsibility to yourself to use a tool such as a safe word when you feel you are being harmed and in a way that you did not agree to especially in the more extreme cases such as these. Having a safe word available but not using it when its needed violates the integrity of having that safe word for just these sorts of situations. If you dont feel comfortable using a safe word when youre in a situation in which youd want to use that safe word then you shouldnt be put into a position where using a safe word is required in the first place. By being in such a situation you not only dont stop yourself from being harmed but you allowed someone to harm you when they may not know theyre harming you and are under the assumption that you will specifically use the safe word to stop them if they are harming you. They are trusting you to use that word just as much as you are trusting them to stop when you use it.The safe word is there to make sure that when people are doing things well outside of their comfort zone or when theyre doing things that could easily be abusive in any other context that consent is implied until that word is used. When I think about the concept of a safe word I hold it as especially sacred. If a safe word is established and someone didnt use it when they felt they needed to then establishing the safe word as a means of making sure Im not hurting them falls apart. I have to trust in the safe word regardless of which position Im in especially since it is going to be my basis of consent.editI just wanted to add that using the safe word should also be held sacred to show the actual gravity of the situation. Using the safe word should mean in the strongest terms possible to stop immediately do not pass go do not collect  dollars you are the weakest link something something tears in the rain STOP. If the word is used in a way that is not taken seriously or if one or more individuals do not take that word seriously  say using it flippantly  then the gravity of the situation must be explained or that sexual partner must be distanced from. If I had a woman use the safe word like the word no is often used to not actually mean no then Id get super pissed for them not taking it seriously. Its important to treat the safe word like a nuclear strike not a water gun.gtBoth men made adjustments when asked but Deen objected to the limitations and was a smart ass about them according to Pierce. James always had something to say Pierce said. He said he had to repeatedly tell Deen to refrain from kink that was excessive for the shoot although he could not remember the exact acts that caused him to have to correct Deen.Probably shouldnt have hired him again then.

5894882,0,t1_cxra9dx,abbreviated for character limitsgt If we had no emotions would we still have moral prescriptionsI daresay wed have regulations and contracts but wed take a corporatelaw approach to them with no interest beyond the bottom line. If the expected total cost of lawsuits exceeds the cost of recalling the product recall it. If it doesnt dont. Why would we care if we were unable to care?gt In fact its often the removal of emotion that causes these people to do these thingsHello. gt which would further create a need for law and order for prescriptions of moral right and wrong independent of emotion.for carving ourselves a position of advantagegt Emotions ... give us a tool to determine based upon our better understanding of the circumstance better determinations of the moral right and moral wrong in that situation.Theyre the only reason to prefer right over wrong in the first place.  Without a tropism motivating you to act on the distinction theres no reason for it to affect your behavior.gt we specifically write laws in spite of emotion because of how aware we are of the unreliability and overzealousness of emotion.Because we are aware of the unreliability of people caught in emotional feedback loops. Just because moths fly into candle flames doesnt mean theyre better off blind. The heuristic can be misapplied but it still works. Take away the heuristic altogether and you have nothing. A damping mechanism to even out the spikes and dips in emotion is absolutely a good and necessary thing for us to progress beyond the socialization of say meerkats.  But it is the basis of emotion that makes us value a fair and just society in the first place. Im not fond of the word empathy I think its overused and often misapplied. Im not even sure I experience it exactly as others do from the way they describe it. What is more important I think is inherently valuing the welfare of others. Not because we share their experience and do not wish to suffer as a result but simply because we hold their suffering to be equally as undesirable as our own. This is a purely irrational emotional response.It may be that what goes around will come around but thats far from certain the universe is a shitty place and comeuppance is rare indeed. Its a far better and more rational bet that we will keep whatever advantage we have and so its far more rational to only care about justice and fairness if were on the losing team. Take that terribly rational and objective approach and you end up with sociopaths libertarians and randroids but I repeat myself. Not my problem dont have to care. And I say fuck that. That approach makes for a shitty society while it may strongly advantage any given individual its a losing strategy overall. As such we evolved a handy tropism to fend that off called reciprocal altruism inducing sadnessanger at the sight of the social contract being violated and warmfuzzies at the sight of overparticipation. A big part of ethical behaviour boiled down to a simple  emotional  buzz. In itself its still a rather shitty cynical moral code since its basically ingroup selfishness as opposed to individual selfishness but apart from the fact that its still an improvement a lot of the time it has some really neat unintended consequences. If theres one thing that brains optimize for its shortcut heuristics and rules of thumb. A quickanddirty approximation is very often good enough for government work. A chunk of the time its a whole lot simpler to leave the ingroup calculations out of your RA. Where youre not constantly living on group borders and trading off the marginal differences you get significantly cheaper faster results with a large degree of overlap. As such if we see someone acting in ways that are usually indicative of socialcontract flouting weve got our gut reaction right there even if its no skin off our nose. We hate to see people hurt. That emotional response makes the world better not worse. gt  revenge rioting mob justice Again youre giving examples of an outofcontrol feedback loop and using that to denigrate the detector at the centre. It wasnt persuasive on the other occasions youve done so and it isnt now.I am at no point denying your claim that people often do bad things when they get worked up about something. I am at no point denying that measured controlled and consistent actions in response to harm are beneficial to society. What I am quite simply claiming is that selfinterest even of the most enlightened kind only takes you so far. Humans have very limited capacity for the enlightened part and the selfinterest part can be abused just as hard and just as horribly as any emotional excess you care to name. An emotional basis for moral perception does exist thankfully and does give us both a safety cap on selfinterest and a reason to give a shit about having one in the first place. gt Emotions are unreliable a poor means of determining moral prescriptions and emotions are a poor means of creating laws and policies with which our society should follow.Emotions are the touchstone the litmus test for the quality of the laws and policies that we create. If you arent upset by the prospect of an unjust law then I do not for one second trust you to make any law at all. Of course ones emotional responses arent sacred readonly things. Humans can be selfish angry shallow and just plain bloody unreasonable. Its something were all prone to at the best of times and its something we have an active obligation to try and mitigate. This is where rational reasonedout moral principles have their greatest value  they are necessary checks and balances that can and should be used to inform our emotional wiring which in turn should inform our ethical principles. . Take your gutlevel moralintuitive response to a situation. . Construct a general principle to try and capture that response. Got into full netseclawyer mode and try to exploit the shit out of it with edgecases dilemmas and contradictions with other principles and ping the results off your emotions again. . Say well shit and redraft the principle trying to avoid the worst of the absurdities. . When you hit a brick wall take a deep breath and reviewrevise your feelings on the matter because youre obviously being a dick somewhere down the stack trace. . Rinse and repeat until you more or less hit equilibrium. Youre now one step closer to a mature ethical perspective keep trying to break it every chance you get. This is how you adult but it only works if youve got both systems in the loop. gt gt Prove that we should help victimized people.gtBecause if we do not we know that the greater whole of society will find other means of seeking justice ...But youve given me no reason to care. Helping victimized people will lead to all those outcomes you mention its true. But without an emotional stake in the welfare of others I have no reason to prefer those outcomes to the alternatives. Youve given me an is Im asking you to prove the ought. And you cant get there from here. gt gt Whats the rational choice between ketchup or mustard on my sandwich?gt Thats based upon personal experience not a discrete variable of a situation. Youve missed my point entirely. You have no rational basis for choosing my condiment you have nothing to gain nor lose from either and you have no emotional stake in the matter. I have an emotional stake the mustard will make me happier. Emotions guide our choices and thats a good thing. They need to be kept on a leash but choices made without them lack authenticity. gt So if we create such a society then we are going to harm others and not live in a just and fair society leaving many of us in an equally vulnerable position if for some reason we are no longer favored by those in power.Experience says otherwise far too much of the time to bet on that outcome and the pragmatic thing to do in any case is to put the effort into preserving the power that you have instead... for instance by shutting down dissenting opinion. If youre only looking out for number one its absolutely your best choice. Get you some likeminded cronies and bar the door to everyone else while living off the benefits it gives you. If doing so would make you feel like a piece of shit however... that might actually tip your hand. gt We use our rational mind to determine the answer to a problem often of which we have an emotional response to. The problem while achieving a solution might be motivated by emotionIf its someone elses problem theres no might be about it.gt is solved by the rational mind and best determined as weve seen throughout history by disconnecting emotions from the rational and finding the solution Solutions like... the Final Solution? Take the humanity out of the decisionmaking process and its prone to run way off the rails.gt The rational mind says that we cant have everyone going around killing anyone that has slighted them. The emotional mind says that we can. The rational mind determines that the emotional mind would create a reality of a lot more destruction.The rational mind says that killing anyone who slighted us gets them out of our hair permanently. The emotional mind says fuck you I wont do it thats horrible and youre a bastard for thinking it you bastard. gt The rational mind determines that the emotional mind would create a reality of a lot more destruction.The emotional mind determines that destruction is bad mkay?gt Emotions are the means in which our biology and our nature manipulates our rational mind into doing things we wouldnt normally do.Thank fuck for that. ,FeMRADebates,cxscq31,3,t5_2y44v

Crenshaw herself explicitly references class and economic considerations in her foundational essay on intersectionality Mapping the Margins Depending on what you mean by social status and institutional influence they might also be factors you could include in an intersectional analysis.Secondly those power influences can be analyzed through an individualist framework but trends and patterns in them can also be analyzed through a collectivist framework. If you wanted to understand a specific individuals experiences in the world an individualist framework of analysis would be more appropriate. If you wanted to talk about trends between members of different communities a collectivist framework would be more appropriate. Intersectionality has been developed for the second.

There are two men that present in nontraditional ways that have been major sex symbols as far as heterosexual women were concerned that spring to mindPrince and Johnny Depp.  I personally have found them both very attractive specifically because of their presentation and Ive also personally found men presenting in a traditionally masculine way very attractive specifically because of their presentation.  So more than one thing can be very viscerally sexy to clearly not just this one heterosexual woman .

People can be racist or homophobic all they want. What they cant do is not recognize that those principles apply to different things differently or treat everything as being the same when they most certainly are not. Im basically pointing out here that firing someone for being gay and firing someone for being racist are categorically different from each other. One works towards equal rights the other against. One is protected the other isnt. Saying that theyre the same thing completely bypasses the numerous differences between them and the basic principle of equal rights that we tend to all accept. Now I could every time an issue comes up that I dont like start by doing what the original comment did and comparing arbitrarily discriminatory practices to discriminatory practices against discrimination but why would I do that? Racism is arbitrarily discriminatory we dont accept arbitrary discrimination so we discriminate against practitioners of it. Pointing out that its discriminatory as if that shows anything relevant is useless as it doesnt actually address the relevant differences between the two positions. The point here being that the basic idea is that discrimination is bad so anything that discriminates is also bad.

I will admit that differences exist for example pleasing the same anatomy that you are used to owning is a different experience than exploring an anatomy basically alien to your own personal sensations but what I contest is their importance to a persons identity.People want to know what gender you identify with because in our culture gender is still a performance. People want to know what gender you are attracted to in order to approximate how they stand with you eg potential dating target vs reliable platonic expectations. But aside from determining if they are personally eligible for your attentions I dont think any other person gives any flying concerns about the details of your dance card.Case in point if I work with John or if I am friends with John but regardless WHAT my gender or orientation is I am simply not personally interested in John perhaps I am taken.

I dont see this as a gendered issue at all though.  It only becomes so because people view the problems women face after sex as not being as serious.  Plenty of women tell guys what they think the guys want to hear say things they dont mean and make promises they dont really intend to keep but since their ends are rarely sex since that isnt too much of a problem for most women we dont view it as a social problem.I would also venture that women assume that guys are not keeping promises or just going for sex when in reality the guy just lost interest.  I find it interesting how we tend to view the guy as a liar in that situation but if a girl says similar things on a date I dont expect we would react the same way ie the default assumption would be that she lost interest because he wasnt good enough.I also dont think you can really blame guys for doing whatever they can to get laid because they are told to act in so many ways that will make it extremely difficult to be successful with women.  Is it really their fault for acting a certain way when noone gives them a code that makes sense for them to actually follow?gtOnly if they are interested in that attention only if their goal is that.The point is that the same thing that drives them getting attention from the paparazzi gives them a multitude of other benefits even if they dislike the vast majority of the people who randomly try to talk to them.Sure the paparazzi suck but if tom cruise tries to get me to tell him how hard his life is because of them he isnt going to get much sympathy from me.,FeMRADebates,cyxagiv,7,t5_2y44v

6240081,0,t3_40zg0l,First its clear that this video was not made for me. It was clearly made for those that are looking for ammunition to use against sjws on the subject of SES and the education of PoC.I mean Im not an SJW and yet I believed the same argument. Anyways on to the arguments.First he uses statistics to show that SES is not a causal factor and I believe he also uses those same statistics to show that its also not a related factor. However hes drawing some interpretation from the data so I am skeptical of SES not being a large contributing factor.However assuming he has said is true I have an alternative hypothesis that might fit. The short version is that by telling PoC that theyre oppressed then do more poorly than they could otherwise and further they meet a sort of selffulfilled prophecy.So to give a rationale for this hypothesis which mind you isnt heavily researched so Im only coming up with an idea that might be worth looking into we can look towards the video that was posted a while back regarding improving student performance in schools. The gentleman was speaking about how one of the larger factors to improve student performance was to hold them accountable regardless of their background. So poor students had the same standards as nonpoor students and thus rose to the occasion rather than getting a pass.Sadly I just looked and I cant find the video that Im referring to. It was however quite interesting.So my hypothesis is such that if treating people as though they are oppressed does have a negative effect upon individual performance which would relate to IQ scores then it could be that they are essentially living the stereotype creating a sort of selffulfilling prophecy or feel as though the system is designed for them to fail. Now the video also talked about how as SES went up so too did the gap. It could be that as the SES of individuals goes up so too does the belief system that the system is rigged against you and thus exasperation for even trying even though there in this hypothetical wasnt anything holding them back.It should be mentioned however that the video that I speaking about only did this change of encouraging students with math and was coming up with new data regarding reading. Accordingly the hypothesis I am suggesting may be flawed from the start  not that it doesnt have potential flaws all over mind you.The alternative again assuming that this video is true and accurate is that we do not presently have another reason as to why PoC are underperforming compared to their white counterparts. Accordingly the video appears to be suggesting that these differences are somewhat inherent with black people particularly as they get wealthier. Im not sure that Im really willing to accept such a conclusion.Disclaimer I had not finished the video at the time of writing this response although I was nearly finished.,FeMRADebates,cyyxhh4,6,t5_2y44v

Certainly theres a time and a place and certainly something like  brings up some questions but turning a sad sad event into a political agenda seems wrong.Now Rickman believed these things though so she was showing his message but even still it comes off like shes pushing a political agenda with his death.

My time is worth more than that.I didnt say you didnt think it was true I said logically dubious as in inconsistent. People honestly believe logically inconsistent things are true all the time usually by using absurd hypothetical or mental gymnastics to justify them.And thats what saying people should be responsible if they choose to drink and drive but not if they drink and sex is logically inconsistent.The two lines that people try to blur in order to extend the definition of rape in this case are the lines between very drunkpassed out and the line between persuasionextortion.The formers being possibly douchey but acceptable and legally defensible and the latters being morally reprehensible illegal and justifiably condemnable.The only reason I see for wanting such a logical inconsistency is because the person arguing it is fairly comfortable that the doublestandard will only be applied in a way that they approve of.An analogy would be people who believe that vice crimes should be dealt with harshly and with no mercy. They tend to believe that because its not their vices that are being treated that way. For example people who drink alcoholuse caffeineuse nicotine regularly yet mercilessly condemn and justify the killing of people suspected of using other drugs.Theyre confident that their vices arent going to be treated that way so their fine being draconian about them. Suggest that we extend that treatment to other vices like alcohol nicotine caffeine or even gluttony and theyll start squealing about the injustice of it.If theres some other non selfserving reason to want double standardslogical inconsistencies then Ill all for hearing it.,FeMRADebates,cz0171d,2,t5_2y44v

But they also took the uncomfortable tone of the threadthe sense that many respondents seemed to be disclosing something that they felt remorse or confusion overas a sign that the responses might be uniquely candid glimpses into rapists unguarded selves.So basically they admit that their data was worthless but they used it anyway because they could gain insight push a narrative.gt The researchers tried to divide the justifications they found into categories victim blaming objectification biological essentialism the idea that men are just horny and cant help it and outright hostility toward women. But they found that these thought processes blurred together. One man wrote that he forced his partner to continue having sex with him even though she was having traumatic flashbacks to a previous rape because his hormones were going insane and she wasnt a person anymore just a path a tool a means to an end. In his story researchers saw the symbiosis of essentialism and objectification.Their categories sound extremely subjective. It also sounds like their conclusions are based on the assumption that theories about Rape Culture toxic masculinity etc. are right... but the purpose of the study seems to be proving those theories.gt They also watched these culturally supplied narratives turn into excuses for men to blame their victims. One man abdicated responsibility with the explanation that an erect dick has no conscience shunting some of the blame onto women by writing that most girls dont really understand how horny guys are how guys will rationalize what they do. In a creepy turn the same man vowed to sit his daughter down for a very frank conversation on malefemale relations when she was old enough to be warned. The researchers wrote about another man who badgered his girlfriend to have sex until she stopped physically and verbally resisting. He was surprised to find her crying afterward in another room but even then he wasnt sure how much of the fault to assume It was as much my responsibility to ensure good communication as it was hers.  She albeit nonverbally implicitly consented to something she felt she had no choice but to consent to. She was wrong and she did have a choice but if she didnt realize that in the moment then what difference does it make?Great violent criminals try to rationalize their terrible actions. Glad we established that. Heres the problem. By nature you are looking at the extreme outliers the deviants of society and trying to make a statement on society as a whole based on how they twist societal values to justify their actions. You could just as easily interview people who committed armed robbery and based on their blaming the victims for flaunting their wealth conclude that political theories that support social safety nets are causing crime.gt In a way the researchers agree with the Reddit threads original critics that allowing rapists to craft narratives in which the crime is inevitable or the victim is to blame helps them to protect themselves from shame or negative selfevaluation which in turn reduces the likelihood of modifying their behavior. The takeaway from the study then is that the appearance of pernicious sexual scripts is never too small or seemingly jocular for concern. Do these people actually think that rapists wouldnt come up with some other way of excusing their actions if the culture was different? Our society already considers rape one of the worst crimes in existence  hell plenty of people consider it worse than murder. You already have to go through some insane mental gymnastics to justify committing rape.The actual study is of course behind a paywall but the summary saysgt Conclusion We contextualize our findings in the empirical literature on sexual assault and in earlier related feminist theory.This isnt science any more than it would be science if I used Libertarian theory to interpret economics results. Feminism is a political movement not a scientific discipline and Feminist Theory is philosophy not science.,FeMRADebates,cz256z1,18,t5_2y44v

6355146,0,t1_czbw2d3,gtI think the idea is that the alignment appears to be expressed superficially for signalling reasons.But why is that? Theres a reason why accusations of pandering are usually only brought up when theres a glaring inconsistency in a politicians views at least at the higher echelons of political commentators and pundits. Its largely because theres no actual way to show that a politician is being insincere in their views unless theres some evidence that their positions change depending on the setting. Mitt Romney wasnt against abortion when governor of Massachusetts a blue state but was suddenly against it when vying for support from red states. It gives us an indication that Romneys stated views are consistent with whatever group hes attempting to sway. Obama did the same thing with samesex marriage when a majority of the public accepted it.But with Trudeau theres nothing indicating that hes being disingenuous at all. His views have remained consistent throughout his political career he made equal representation of women in government and a host of other womens issues a main or major part of his campaign and he hasnt flipflopped or been shifty in stating his views on gender and has generally been a vocal advocate for women since the start. Im hard pressed to see how more of the same is pandering when theres no evidence at all that hes just superficially playing to the crowd irrespective of his beliefs.Now if you follow Canadian politics at all I dont know so if you do then some of this will probably be common knowledge youd find that Trudeau is the son of Canadas most influential leader Pierre Trudeau. PT was responsible for among other things advocating for womens rights creating the cabinet position of the Minister of the Status of Women ushered in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and generally just did a lot for civil rights and gender equality when he was in power. Theres even a story where after a native cabinet minister tells him his daughter wanted to be PM when she grew up and a serious PT responded Ill keep the door open for her while the rest of the cabinet laughed at such a ludicrous notion. The point here being that Justin Trudeau grew up in a very liberal and political setting where womens issues were a big thing. Given his history heritage what he was surrounded by and the fact that hes only ever said the same thing Im extremely hard pressed to see where hes pandering. Clinton may seem insincere due to the political expediency of her being a woman. I mean it comes across as exceptionally selfserving just due to that.

6356856,0,t1_czc6z8q,gt This probably is true to some degree but which areas? Unemployment benefit? Subsidised housing? And are those given preferentially to women or to people with children? Likewise in their private lives people probably are more supportive of women.Housing schooling employement programs small business subsidies grants loans preferential treatment by female teachers education being very likely curtailed to fit what are seen as traditionally female patterns of learning over male and so on. Im Canadian for instance and we have something called Employement Equity that makes it legally impossible for menchiefly white mento get a public sector job unless they are they only qualified applicant to apply. This is the law. As for welfare well do you wanna know what got me so interested in this gender shit? When I was told explicitly that I was going to be denied immediate help benefits because I am a man and had selfemployment income within the last year around  years ago as an  year old kid with no parents to support him. I was told plainly and truly that a woman in my position would never be treated that way due to the ideology of the social workers. Sure enough I was and thank god I was told this. Also even if truethat its merely that women are single mothers or whateverthis is de facto discrimination given how men are indisputably more poorly treated by the family court system barring them from this prospect unless they want to sink several tens of thousands of dollars battling for custody. gtMen choose to get married knowing that alimony is a contractual obligation if you divorce.Again subject to the heavily biased court system. If you want to say Well its mens CHOICES to do what they do knowing the system is unfair and discriminatory go ahead I guess but thats kind of proving my point. gtwomen choose to work part time more to look after their children Its shown that women just choose to work part time more and this is where were on the same page because their usuallymale SOs let them and encourage them. I do not believe however that women are pressured to do so very much given that Ive seen quite a few studies showing that women want nothing more these days than to not work which honestly makes perfect sense given how much work sucks for the average person. gtI dont see how you can object to the pressure which leads to a welfare gap for men without similarly objecting to the pressure leading to a wage gap for women.Because one has its discriminatory power rooted in actual institutionalization. I dont understand where your misunderstanding comes from here. Now lets just say the above werent true and all these things above were gender blind. Would men kill themselves more? Would they be taking on more work responsibilities? Most definitely. More dangerous jobs? Of course. Would they be more emotionally closed off not a bad thing? Absolutely.

6491503,0,t1_czpcbnp,The study argues both are the most likely cause.  gtAlthough figures captured are inconclusive and official records of justice service providers suggest a decrease in SGBV case numbers during the crisis as compared with the first half of the year qualitative research based on individual interviews with stakeholders and Focus Group Discussions FGDs revealed that the numbers recorded do not reflect the situation on the ground. Findings from the five categories of fifteen FGDs also clearly depict an increase in the occurrence of SGBV particularly sexual penetration of children domestic violence sexual harassment and abandonmentneglect. CSOs also reported an increase in deprivation of property with Ebola widows being denied inheritance due to genderbased discrimination. During the FGD with mature women in Kono one participant noted Our tradition describes women as property of men this is why we as women are considered property in our marriages with little and no rights over property. and families.gtAccording to the various groups interviewed all communities are experiencing high prevalence of sexual penetration of children. Some communities estimate that the percentage increase of teenage pregnancy ranges from between forty to sixtyfive percent. Findings in relation to increased teenage pregnancy are corroborated by the assessment carried out by the United Nations Population Fund on access to sexual and reproductive health services during the crisis. Female participants of FGDs raised serious concerns about the increasing prevalence of teenage pregnancy especially related to economic hardships of adolescents and their parents leading to transactional sex. The increase in teenage pregnancy is also reflected in official figures recorded but often the cases are recorded as teenage pregnancy not reflecting the applicable offence of sexual penetration of children see figure  below as provided for under the Sexual Offences Act SOA . It is therefore also unclear based on case numbers whether the majority of cases result from consensual teenage relationships or from abuse of teenage girls. Interviews and FGDs would suggest a combination of both. In the focus group discussion with teenage boys in Kailahun one participant said We the young boys are responsible for most of the teenage pregnancies therefore we need to realize that we are damaging the future of our sisters and communities because without education for our sisters they will not attain their full potential to support themselves only to depend on men.

6522411,0,t1_czsuomk,gtOf course there is. Everything thats not explicit and so necessarily verbal or written consent is implied. You can certainly imply consent from actions.No there isnt. The important term in that sentence was legally. Consent of the victim is an element of actus rea. As youve pointed out it deals with the state of mind of the victim. As Ive pointed out the SCC decision explicitly dealt with the exact issue of implied consent as it relates to Canadian law in the case R. v. Ewanchuk. From the preamblegtAt issue here are whether the trial judge erred in his understanding of consent in sexual assault and whether his conclusion that the defence of implied consent exists in Canadian law was correct.The rest of the document explains in detail how theres no legal basis for using implied consent as a defense. In fact it quite explicitly refutes your statement here gtHere the trial judge accepted the complainants testimony that she did not want the accused to touch her but then treated her conduct as raising a reasonable doubt about consent described by him as implied consent.  This conclusion was an error.and then goes on the explain how the Canadian legal system assesses consent. Primarily the victims consent is a component of actus rea which gets determined before delving into mens rea which is where implied consent would come into play but its too late by that point. Mens rea can only be determined after actus rea has been resolved. Which means at least under Canadian law that a sexual assault took place. The prosecution still needs to prove mens rea and there is also a defense of honest but mistaken belief that consent was given but at no point does the court further consider the complainants conduct in relation to whether they themselves consented. gtIm pretty sure but not certain that the onus doesnt change until the prosecution meets the burden of proof that there was not consent. More importantly thoughEr not exactly. The way it works here again I have to reiterate that Im not a lawyer but constitutional law the SCC and the judiciary are well within my scope of studyresearch Due to how the courts view consent as being the victims internal state of mind the crown need only show that that it aligns with the evidence. While the defense can call the credibility of the testimony into question the main difference here is that the defense needs to provide reasonable doubt not that the prosecution proves it. This somewhat strange way of going about it is primarily due to how the courts define consent with regards to actus rea. Which is to say that given that the only direct evidence relating to consent is the testimony given by the victim about their subjective state of mind at the moment of the incident only the most egregious and blatant sexual assaults would be able to prove a lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Which is why mens rea and actus rea are separated why the former gets determined before the latter and why the defense of implied consent doesnt actually work here. The lack of consent has already been determined and accepted by the time any defense of implied consent can be mounted. In any case as Ive said before in this thread I dont think to you though I think this has far more to do with some Canadian legal nuances and oddities than anything else. gtTheres nothing to support this assertion. While its possible even probable its not a sure thing. And thats why your pointLook the facts of what actually happened arent being contested and given that that includes physically striking and choking another human being during a sexual encounter I really dont think the courts would object given that those actions in any other setting would be considered assault and hitting and choking another human being isnt something easily communicated through nonverbal or explicit means. The only case thats ever dealt with anything remotely close to this was in the UK which ruled that normal methods of communicating consent were sufficient except in cases that could cause bodily harm. Though theres nothing directly related to this exact scenario in Canadian law  I think its probably somewhere in the ballpark of how it will be reasoned. For the life of me I cant actually think of any legal rationale or justification for it being higher than that.gtThis is effectively a balance of probabilities test when this is a criminal trial.Yes but remember that this is all assuming that the facts and events given in the complainants testimony are assumed to be true. This is an if then statement and the if in this case is most likely true anyways considering that the defense isnt contesting them. When attacking the credibility of a witness defense attorneys are required out of fairness to put to that witness what they anticipate theyre clients version of events is going to be. The fact that the defense attorney has not in any way brought up the question of but you were consenting to that punch implies that the defense isnt objecting to what happened or raising the question that it could have been consensual. Theyre steering clear of questions of consent and focusing on inconsistencies in witnesses stories speaking to their overall credibility as witnesses. On top of that given that this specific question is about consent which operates by different rules in Canadian law. And given that Ghomeshis defense here would be the honest but mistaken belief that consent was given which requires corroborative evidence Im not too sure Im actually wrong about this. Its worth noting here that the Crown neednt prove mens rea it only needs to show that the accused acted voluntarily. Heres the relevant criminal codegt. It is not a defence to a charge under section   or  that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subjectmatter of the charge wheregta the accuseds belief arose from the accusedsgti selfinduced intoxication orgtii recklessness or wilful blindness orgtb the accused did not take reasonable steps in the circumstances known to the accused at the time to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.Basically considering that the defense isnt challenging or raising doubt about whether consent was given or the sequence of events as well as the unique nature of how Canada views determines and examines consent in trials on top of the fact that the crown only needs to prove that Ghomeshis actions were voluntary and especially given that Ghomeshi needs to show that he did in fact take reasonable steps to ascertain consent Id say that Im actually fairly confident in what Ive said.However as Ive said before Im certainly not a lawyer so take all this with a grain of salt. Though I was kind of downplaying  my credentials too. My academic research focuses pretty heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada and the judiciary so its not like Im a total laymen either. But again not a lawyer. And to be honest I dont really care about the Ghomeshi trial all that much. Mostly I just find these kinds of discussions stimulating but Im not really invested in any way to it except that I find them fun. ,FeMRADebates,cztyw2j,1,t5_2y44v

Its like any selfreinforcing unfalsifiable dogmatic assumption. The revolution is always coming comrades. Its used to explain away or even reverse the meaning of disconfirming evidence. The content of patriarchy ultimately for someone who acknowledges a large number of mens issues is nothing more than that harmful gender roles are something men as a group impose on themselves and women who have no agency to perpetuate it. If they do its internalised misogyny Marxists called it false consciousness. If a woman benefits in some way qua her being a woman its benevolent sexism. If men are harmed its because of toxic masculinity and so on.

6547872,0,t1_czwaz9v,gt downvoting people for being feminists?I urge you not to fall into the trap of thinking this way for a few reasons. I recognize this may be an unwelcome commentary but I mean it in the best possible way. I am grateful you are here that you identify as a feminist and I enjoy reading your posts and value what you have to say.At three hours in your concern is too early. At this moment your score is hidden to others and only you are seeing the numbers. By the time your score shows and votes trail off you may well find you are back in the positives which will make your comment seem odd at the very least.People tend to reflexively downvote people who complain about downvotes. If the majority of readers are downvoting you pointing it out doesnt suddenly reach them or open their minds. Since there is no hope of accomplishing anything by mentioning it it can at best be a complaint to an unsympathetic audience which people recognize and punish.Lastly from my own experience I have learned to listen to the community who may be trying to tell me something. When I commented that everyone should consider themselves a feminist and be proud of it I got lots of downvotes. When I thought at length about it I realized that most folks have given up on the feminist label despite supporting most of its positive values. This was important for me to learn. I am an outlier here. I cannot bludgeon the community into line with my expectations or hopes.By ascribing such a simplistic motive to your downvoters  punishing you for your flair  you are creating a narrative that may have no relation to the truth and you are insulting the community. If I had to guess I would say the downvotes are coming from people who are tired of hearing NAFALT as far as your suggestion that the Facebook group is isolated rather than a microcosm of whats happening in society right now.,FeMRADebates,czwlqid,12,t5_2y44v

Men were about three quarters of assault victims in a twoyear period in an urban accident and emergency department in Norway and in Canada in  they were considerably more likely to be the victim of assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm .Maybe its because men are much more likely to walk alone at night or get into similar riskydangerous situations?,FeMRADebates,d028klt,6,t5_2y44v

I dont think it makes sense to ignore this and keep pointing to the one risk factor that Person A has as somehow being more important when the reality is that Person B is more likely to get the disease.I think it could make sense if you look at it like this. Person A has one risk factor for disease A. Person B has four risk factors for disease B. If disease B has treatments available for it but disease A does not would you really rather be person A? Its options vs. powerlessness being weighed with the likelihood of a given scenario occurring. A lot of people here are focusing on the probability but neglecting the ability of men vs. women in defending themselves.Again Im not saying its better to be person B.

What if hes dead impossible to locate or cannot be found? If thats the case why not just pick ANY man the mother has slept with in her life? After all he consented to sex and therefore to parenthood right? It doesnt matter that him having sex with her didnt actually result in a pregnancy he chose to take the risk of having to pay child support so is there any real reason he shouldnt be made to pay just because it isnt technically his child?

7004460,0,t1_d198sqm,gt The MRM isnt addressing this issue directly as their general concern is around men as a whole. Though I do believe their efforts to make people more comfortable with the idea of single fathers or just fathers as a whole will help gay couples to achieve more equity when it comes to adoption. Its a slow process of norm changes laws will probably not help much even if we have antidiscriminatory laws we will have biases that judge others. Id like to address this part specifically and use it to illustrate to others why the MRM would not perhaps consider itself intersectional in the traditional understanding of the word.The issues with gay male couples adopting would from the point of view of the MRM be largely assuaged by removing the image of men as predators from the public mind. By focusing on men the broadest possible group of people is targetted catching both Single Men and Gay Male Couples under one net.The MRM isnt intersectional in as much as it focuses specifically on focal points but rather I would say it was intersectional in that it tries to remove the most intersections in one go.,FeMRADebates,d1aat95,2,t5_2y44v

7136058,0,t3_4d9pcr,Theres nothing really you can do thats not going to make things worse to be honest. The big thing to understand is the idea of microcultures and how they interact like a sort of Venn Diagram. There are places and cultures in our society which are more egalitarian and places and cultures that are not. Thats just a reality. So the experience of someone who lives in a less egalitarian place might be entirely different than someone who lives in a more egalitarian place. Or say you live in an environment with multiple stores. Store  might attract X clientele for whatever reason and Store  might attract Y clientele for whatever reason. Maybe that results in more problems being in store  than store . But the big point is that whatever the difference is its probably external to gaming or gaming culture as a whole. Note I just saw this on rboardgames Apparently its a response to that particular article. gt    Yeah Ive read this and weve seen the same thing from this individual last year when she expressed herself in our forums you can easily find it if you really want to read through all that vitriol and then took it upon herself to hound after my employees to demand a direct talk with myself how I am responsible for stepping up to make certain the community at large the whole of gaming and geek society not just Malifaux is policed and to bring her on board to be the Womans Ambassador to Gaming and to make certain that Wyrd is doing it right and proper as were apparently misogynistic asses here. Considering that a large majority of the work force here is female the males are outnumbered I sort of kinda doubt were all running around scratching our crotches and telling the ladies how they do it for us.gt   Somewhere in there apparently threats have been issues to her in my name as well as the companys and supposedly that there are copious amounts of evidence that has been made available to the Canadian law authorities as well as the FBI which apparently were soon to swoop down and confiscate our entire office computers and arrest us if I didnt take the time to take her Skype call. That never happened. We also never received any copies of said evidence so that we could follow up or ban individuals from this end.gt    After multiple phone calls emails etc etc etc she and her circle of friends have been told to please do hand over any and all evidence to the authorities as we do not condone or tolerate any behavior of that matter beyond that all harassment calls without evidence beyond someones anger at the community could be directed to our on retainer lawyer who would love nothing more than to bill me for the privilege of telling folks legally what and where to go with it and to please bring forth legal evidence so that it can be sorted directly. To date that has never happened and neither myself the company or any individuals within it condone such behavior and if we did find someone of that ilk among us it would be a rather large surprise and a swift exit out the door to authorities.gt    As this issue is almost a year old at this point and Ive yet to see any evidence to date nor been contacted by authorities in any manner I can only assume that someone is wanting to stir the waters and get attention. I neither know this individual personally nor what has happened in their history what I do know. is what she has tried to do to this company and community with zero evidence of any misbehavior from anyone at Wyrd.

7147694,0,t1_d1qigpc,gt you just arent agreeing with the usual academic definition of privilegeThe problem is that the academic definition is a form of framing One of the issues I have with Social Justice theories is the tendency to frame issues as an oppressoroppressed Marxist dichotomy where the definitions are not neutral but diverge from reality in ways that validate a false world view. A world view that scapegoats one group and pedestals another. The tendency for many believers of these theories to attack others for having privilege is good evidence of how this framing unconsciously pushes people towards antagonism and bigotry.Privilege as used by SJ people is something that one group has and the opposite group doesnt. White people have privilege due to their skin color while black people dont. Men have privilege women dont. This is a claim that one group is universally privileged and another isnt. In reality the effects are highly contextual. Being a man and thus judged as a hyperagent is good when running for president but not so good when they are looking to pin a crime on someone or need soldiers to exchange bullets with the enemy. There is no universal privilege here. Depending on the context being a man is a privilege sometimes and a disprivilege in other cases and vice versa for being a woman.This is reality yet it is not compatible with the definition of privilege that SJ people tend to use.gt Unfortunately for you this simply makes it impossible for you to communicate effectively in academic discussion of gender issues.I would argue that its impossible for academics to discuss this topic effectively when they adopt definitions that contain hidden assumptions. You get blind spots where the definitions ignore possibilities like men facing systemic disadvantages and at that point the choice becomes to create a philosophical model that doesnt describe reality and ignore facts that clash with it or to do a fundamental reassessment and rebuild the theories on a more solid factbased foundation.The first approach is effective in the sense that one can have a solid career in social sciences by joining in on the established tunnel vision and cherry picking evidence. However it is not so effective if your definition of the word involves describing the world as it is.PS. Its interesting that there has been quite a bit of feminist theorizing about how language contributes to gender rolesstereotypesnorms through framing but AFAIK there is no work on how feminist language does something similar.,FeMRADebates,d1qman6,13,t5_2y44v

As you can see said arguments are so nonexistent that the entire piece can be flipped to support its antithesis with the only noticeable change being the invention of an entrenched masculinist academic orthodoxy heck Im pretty sure I could do one of these for religious versus atheist or liberal versus conservative its all so damn vagueJane Doe is a yearold Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the University of Victoria. Her research focuses on issues facing women with a foundation in masculinist theory. But she used to be a feminist.I discovered feminism when I was  working at a bookstore in downtown Kelowna British Columbia. I was trying to earn some money before starting my second year at university  when I noticed the book Feminism is for Everybody.I bought it hook line and sinker. I was studying political science at the time so I had never thought about social processes like misogyny and sexism. It was revelatory. The book talked about how patriarchy oppressed everyone but mainly women because it despises feminine qualities.The chapter that stood out the most was about how women are objectified on television especially sitcoms. Their husbands meanwhile are these competent men who have to support their useless wives. Pop culture conveyed women as hysterical sex objects. The men were the empowered ones the voices of reason. Home Improvement with Tim Allens high powered career and disproportionately attractive wife was the primary example.Looking back I realize Home Improvement was actually mocking maleness. It was about a man who spoke in grunts to his wife  her wit never failing to eclipse his own  while he bumbled from disaster to disaster only to be narrowly saved by his better half. But it took me a long time to realize that.Im not sure which came first  my sense women were undervalued or my reading Feminism is for Everybody  but I do know the book crystallized that feeling.When my coworkers disapproved of my newfound views it was just confirmation of misogyny. Why would they be so angry if they werent threatened by what I was saying? My coworkers were a lot less friendly to me after that. About three weeks later I was fired.I was so confused at that time in my life so unsure of myself that I was especially susceptible to something like feminism. Later I discovered I suffer from clinical depression. Theres lot of literature on how socially extremist groups  such as misandric feminism or white supremacy  exploit young women whose lives are in turmoil their beliefs in conflict. Feminism is for Everybody was a recruitment piece and I was an easy target.I sought out other women who felt like me. This was in the Web . presocial media days so it was mostly chat rooms or poorly written protoblogs on LiveJournal all of them fueled by rage and fear. I adopted this rhetorical trick many feminists employ Im not a misandrist LOL misandry doesnt even exist patriarchy hurts men too.Every once in a while Id stumble across feminists advocating killing men and Id think to myself Thats insane. But then Id do what a lot of feminists do Id say Those voices are on the fringe and argue they didnt speak for the movement as a whole.I graduated in  with a political science degree and spent a couple years doing odd jobs  bartender tuxedo salesman. Soon I realized I wanted to do academic work specifically studying women and femininity so I reenrolled in some sociology courses. I was like Ill use my academic qualifications to talk about feminist issues. Ill grit my teeth and listen to the masculinists and read their stupid books but then Ill go my own way. Things didnt go as planned.As I read masculinist texts it didnt take long for my feminist beliefs to start falling away. They didnt stand up to all the empirical evidence I was finally reading  research that was informed by masculinist theory and offered actual solutions.Women are socialized to display hypoagency and hypergamy. Were only allowed to express our actions proxied through men. As a feminist I always believed it was men and masculinism putting women in this box. But these masculinist texts not only validated the crisis of femininity they pointed out women are the biggest policers of femininity. Women humiliate each other for being butch for lacking daintiness or taking charge.Masculinists and feminists were acknowledging the same problems but the feminists werent locating the right cause. The masculinists pointed out No actually this is rooted in the same traditionalist institutions that are harming men. It was subtle but profound.And masculinism showed that intersectional feminism simply allowed straight white wealthy middleclass feminist groups to usurp oppression borne by others and pervert its study to suit the cause of straight white wealthy middleclass women.I realized all the arguments about female oppression I had bought into were weak. And all the evidence I needed was in masculinism.I discovered Tumblr which is a hotbed of feminism around  but luckily by then I was already moving away from the movement. A lot of the stuff there was elementary anyway.My transformation didnt happen overnight though. There wasnt really an Aha! moment but more of a progression. I had to deconstruct all the feminist beliefs I had internalized. My classmates shuddered every time I opened my mouth. I would write these profeminist arguments that I thought made sense but my instructors would say This is a tautology.At one point I made the argument that makeup was oppressive to women that it was an attempt to objectify us because we werent good enough as we were. One of my male peers turned to me and said I originally studied a highearning subject I loathed so that I could live up to societys expectations of men. Dont talk to me about objectification.I ended up enrolling in a masters program for sociology. And by the end of my first semester I realized I knew nothing. From there it was a slow process of building.I finished my masters in  and in  I started publicly identifying as an MRA. Now Im a sociology Ph.D. candidate at the University of Victoria.My focus is still on women that much hasnt changed since my feminist days but my work recognizes that the single most powerful set of tools for understanding the issues women face can be found in masculinist analysis.Despite my best efforts Im an idealist and I honestly truly believe sociology can be an activist discipline. It can teach young people how our society constructs inequality and once we start down that road we can do something about it.There are some feminists who claim feminism is a gender egalitarian movement but thats incorrect. The feminist movement has always been antimale first womens issues second.Every time I look back at the feminist movement all I see is negativity rage hate bitterness and fear. But I dont feel ashamed of my time in it. I dont even know that I regret it because without it I might not have ended up where I am now. It turned me on to the study of women and eventually to masculinism.Ive been dating the same man since  and oh god I mustve gotten on his nerves back then. uPMMEURPERESTROIKA satirizing Edwin Hodge as told to John McDermottEDIT This really didnt deserve gold but thanks anyway.,FeMRADebates,d25zc4a,20,t5_2y44v

7289752,0,t1_d268wsw,gt what MRAs generally think toxic masculinity means is completely different from how feminists explain it.Can you elaborate on this? Most of the MRM believes that while feminism has acknowledged most aspects of hegemonic masculinity which involve the oppression and degradation of womens rights as toxic rape culture dominance etc. less has been done to cover the aspects which hurt men. Yes men socialised to repress feelings has been mentionedbut the systemic issues which often cause repression of empathy towards men by both men and women particularly the social pressure by women has been downplayed. Ive often seen the reasoning if we dont teach men to open up and embrace their emotions they might become misogynistic or contribute to rape culture. This is what I can only call feminineprimary interest.  Given a coin toss between male disposability via performative masculinity or men developing misogynistic attitudes or behaviours it always seems to be the latter which is treated as priority and as threat. This is part of the OppressorOppressed Gender Dynamic Jolly refers to elsewhere and Im sure youre familiar with.  gt Again to me it just looks like a huge bias MRM is very logical and good if he chose feminism over MRM he must have been somehow tricked or abused into it.Thats again not what is being said uSunjammer. You might infer that but frankly the article doesnt portray feminists in a sympathetic light. He experiences being socially shunned by his audience in every encounter he mentions until the textbooks are finally placed in front of him on his course. Even then there is a following example of a woman basically telling him to check his privilege re cosmetics industry. So were not saying MRM is he must have been tricked or at least Im not.

Itd be cool to have a more involved essay into the role of society in the development of the self because I think thats the missing link here. Like while the self is mostly independent of gender but the development of the self and the perception of others is affected by percieved gender in many ways. Not that theres anything inherently wrong with development being affected by percieved gender at least not in any way thats different than development being affected by percieved economic class or race  but I do think there can be some problems there.

Not based on the income or lack thereof of the custodial parent.  If the custodial parent is poor they may need to be on public assistance  this doesnt mean they can force the noncustodial parent to pay more child support.What I am saying is that a child deserves time with any parent who is willing and able.  If two parents have equal custody then they should each cover the childs expenses during that time.  The only reason payments might happen in that situation is if there are large occasional expenses yearly school fees for example that need to be split.  If one parent has less than  custody then they should be making child support payments to account for that time that they are not covering their kids expenses.,FeMRADebates,d2i7kz6,2,t5_2y44v

7461919,0,t1_d2qcgq0,gt I dont know about today but I think that highschoolers can seize on something they dislike about an unpopular person and blow it out of proportion. The fact that Kate was already unpopular because of her abstinence promotion just gave them an excuse to humiliate her when she became slutty by kissing multiple boys at a party. They knew that it was extra hurtful to her because of her religious background.Thats true it just struck me as weird that all of these people had such negative reactions about what seemed from the descriptions like a fairly tame video. In my high school different schooling system it was generally a small group of often the same kids making a big deal out of something to humiliate someone and getting the rest of the kids to join in. And my experience is that that kind of stuff and the social structure that makes it possible more or less stops happening after high school but maybe thats because I went to university when I was .gtI agree that this may have been why they made many violent male characters but its also perpetuating the idea that we should fear men because they are violent by nature which I disagree withWell in principle I agree with you here and Ive actually experienced the negative effects of people automatically viewing men as a threat Im quite large but on the other hand I dont think its wrong for creators to use tropes or common ways of thinking to more effectively communicate their message. So Im conflicted on this I think itd be good if we didnt view men as threats but I also think itd be stupid to say that designers should be sure to include lithe women in sundresses among their big hairy bikers when making physically intimidating characters.gtAbout the they should consider changing the characters race my position is that games are improved when developers make thoughtful decisions about what they put in the game. Obviously I accept whatever they ultimately choose to put in the game even if I say I dont like it or that its not a good choice. If a developer reflects on the race of a character and decides that there is some legitimate worthwhile purpose behind that choice then thats the kind of thoughtfulness thats going to produce a meaningful and immersive game experience.Here I again agree with your first sentence completely but am conflicted about the last part. Of course you have the right to approve or disapprove of a specific decision but on the other hand if a developer has put thought into a choice I dont think you get to decide whether the reasons they had for making that choice are worthwhile or legitimate. For example a developer may choose to make a certain character white specifically because white is viewed as the default if they wish to avoid making their game a discussion about race or wish to avoid making that characters race important. ,FeMRADebates,d2qdh4u,1,t5_2y44v

I think there probably are a slightly larger number of men who feel the need to send a fuck you to shows coded for the other gender. But this relatively small discrepancy gets blown up into those nasty horrible bros trashing women again. But that buries the actual story which is that male and female ratings for all sorts of shows are actually remarkably similar. And of the number of men who do rate shows like Sex and the City the vast majority seem to provide honest scores which albeit systematically lower than female scores as expected dont seem to support the idea that men are unthinkingly trashing the programme in any serious number.

7745871,0,t1_d3m2w77,I like most of the examples on this list havent played Bayonetta so I can only speak about it to the extent that Ive picked things up from Osmosis but I thought Ivy was just... really weird.According to supplemental materials Ivy is supposedly chaste in the sense of not engaging in sexual conduct obviously not in terms of dress sense. Ive heard a few people argue that this is due to the creators being repressive of female sexuality and wanting to present a highly sexualized woman to the audience whos safe due to not exercising her sexuality autonomously. I dont think this explanation is right because if that were the true motivation they wouldnt hide that information information which nobody would realistically guess by observing her character in the game away in supplemental materials that most players are never likely to read. My interpretation is that its motivated by the surprise factor nobodys going to be particularly interested in supplemental materials which only serve to confirm stuff the players could already have guessed without it so the authors decide to throw in counterintuitive stuff on purpose.But it does suggest to me that they didnt care all that much about making her a coherent character with consistent and sensible motivations. Its a fighting game of course so story and characterization is generally not going to be the strong point but Im really just not left with the sense that the characters are meant to be compelling on a level beyond the aesthetic.,FeMRADebates,d3mndw4,3,t5_2y44v

Trying to unilaterally change men in order to create a better world. They got their name from the Mens liberation movement sooogt One of the subjects Ive seen a lot of discussion of over there is Mens entitlement towards having a relationship. Sure. Fine. If you want to change that in a nonunilateral fashion you need to stop people from celebrating their relationships or talking in society about how its a good thing things like that. Now of course this is a price that nobody wants to pay. So I personally believe that whole concept needs to be thrown out the window.The conversation revolves around toxic masculinity which revolves around Connells Masculinities which revolves around the OppressorOppressed Gender Dichotomy.

7767146,0,t1_d3p142w,Its Schwarzeneggers second comedy. He a cop has to disguise himself as a kindergarten teacher in the school of a felons sons school. In hope that he can catch the felon whos hiding. Basically the plot goes as you would expect it from a similar teacher if you would simply judge him by his looks.He freaks out the very first day due to stress. Then he decides that he knows the solution and turns into a de facto drill instructor This is the story line up to this point but I will continue a hypothetical situation where Mr. Kimble Shcwarzenegger will illustrate what influential feminism means to me. So from this point everything is fiction.So Mr. Kimble feels unfamiliar in this environment and fails. He not only starts to apply his own methods and turn the kindergarten into a boot camp but he discovers a pattern. A pattern where female behavior is normal he sees that females hold all the power in this realm. He is the newcomer in the realm but instead of adopting he wants everybody to adapt to him. He fails to dive into things and see whether it actually works. Instead he names the phenomenon hes experiencing girly thing. He sees that female colleagues are better at calming children by taking them in their arms and hugging them. Its unnatural to him so he bans hugs to level the field. He considers this realm the product of a cultural force rather than something developed throughout generations and something that shaped people to the best practice.He starts to lecture other people that this realm is the product of wrong societal practices and it is unwelcoming to other Mr. Kimbles. He pushes a legislation for quotas to have more Mr. Kimbles in kindergartens and make it more gender equal. He says that if the Mr. Kimbles of the past were not dismissed by this realm they couldve been achieved the same success or even more as other teachers did. So in the future there will be some Mr. Kimlbes who are worse in skill than Mrs. Schlowskis but those Kimbles are accepted and some Schlowskis are rejected. To make this realm more gender equal.And Mr. Kimble states that this girly thing favors women in general and assigns power to them in this realm. So thats what patriarchy as a word is to me.

Weve all seen the critique before of how some feminists just want equality when it benefits women without fighting for the bad equality when it doesnt. But the quotation that he used is simply the opposite  arguing that equality is when women have it equally as bad but not when women have it equally as good.

Those are world wars the largest scale wars in the whole known human history literally the only two such wars in existence. They really shouldnt be used as a template for plausible upcoming wars. The Cold war is much more plausible example. Theres no reason to believe WWIII would happen in the same fashion as the other two. Russia vs America or North Korea vs America isnt WWIII. Even if NATO got involved and it certainly would it still wouldnt be WWIII. People have been saying WWIII is just around the corner for like two decades now but all we had was separate conflicts not mass alliances.And what is conventional itself has changed. Three hundred years ago cannons and sword were conventional not anymore. Back then informational warfare wasnt conventional because there wasnt means of that. The world of today isnt the same as  years ago. Thats like speculating what would happen in case of a new dictatorship drawing on Hitler example. Sure the core might be the same but the delivery and results would be very different. What worked back then wouldnt work today and vice versa.I dont understand why the draft in USA exists anyway. You have one of the largest armies in the world if not the largest with plenty of people who volunteered to be in the army. And to my understanding all men have to do is just sign some paper when they turn  but they never actually have to go through the mandatory military training do they? Sounds like a shitty system to me. Other countries that have draft have much smaller armies so at least the need for more people makes more sense and they actually have to go through several months of mandatory training. Whats the point of having a list with the names of men if theyre not actually trained to fight or prepared at all? If an actual war broke out there wouldnt be enough time to prepare them all so fast. Not that mandatory basic training is that useful at all in my country they just learn the history of military how to handle guns get some drilling and thats it no actual danger involved but still more useful than just signing a paper.,FeMRADebates,d3ya6od,3,t5_2y44v

Its a very targeted question Im going to try my best to phrase my meaning exactly so it doesnt come off that Im making some sort of tacit implications.For starters I am not condoning rape. I am not apologizing for rapists or the act of raping another individual. I believe rape victims need our support as do victims of other crimes and we ought to make sure they can do the things they need to do and get access to whatever resources they need to continue on with their lives normally.  And lastly just because you are about to read below references and points to other crimes this does not mean rape is the same as or is a complete parallel to those crimes.  That is not how metaphors work.That being said it wasnt brought up here but it was something I was discussing not mere moments before seeing this post and reading the entry.Heres my questionWhy is teach men not to rape such a common utteranceseemingly latelybut there is no equivalent for any other crime?I wont profess to speak for the majority of men but rape was something I was taught early and consistently as something you absolutely do not do to anyone. It was part of sex ed in my formative years my father and I had the talk I got a third lesson my senior year of high school taking a Civics Econ and Law class.Teach men not to rape is often countered by many with but we already do.  I saw this happen today and it got me thinking not on the effectiveness of the teachh men not to rape point which is I think at the nexus of the but we already do counterpoint but I may be wrong but why Ive never seen that type of argument applied to anything else.There was yet another mass shooting this weekend Orlando Florida. Ive not heard a teach people not to commit mass murders phrase catch onI suppose its ingrained that we at some level know its not okay to murder.  But we as a species are rabidly murderous creatures. I havent seen a teach people not to stealswiper no swiping debate banner waved. I suppose we understand and were probably taught as a kid with a stern lesson from mom and dad dont take whats not yours. Yet people are still robbed daily some by individuals hiding in shadows others by much larger powerful and integrated players in society.Im coming into this with an open mind probably not fully organized on the matter...but it is something on my mind. Teach men not to rape.  Im not going to say We shouldnt Im not going to entertain that in my mind at all.I am just mostly wondering why when rape still happens when murder and theft still happens why Ive apparently never heard that mode of appeal made on the behalf of other crimes. ,FeMRADebates,d466dvc,10,t5_2y44v

7961861,0,t1_d4a806s,See I disagree that your examples would qualify as toxic femininity if I were to subscribe to such a notion which I do not. As this latest thread of countless points out toxic  is a bit of a Rorschach test. For purposes of making my point Im going to say that toxic femininity would have to meet these criteria to be parallel to toxic masculinity It would have to be an expression of self or kind of behavior traditionally associated with womenIt would have to be seen in benign expression as positiveIt would be necessary to single out an example of bad behavior nearly universally acclaimed as bad behavior and then a line...however tenuous...would have to drawn from the positive expression to the negative oneSo mean girl syndrome doesnt really cut the mustard. Indeed mean girl behavior if it is an extreme example of anything is an extreme example of competitiveness and status seeking behavior typically regarded as masculine traditionally. So again the trope of manbad womangood is in evidence. No we need to start with a positive traditionally feminine trait. Lets go with collaboration and nurturing. That definitely fits my first two criteria. Ok the negative expression of those traits would be someone who is controlling or manipulative. Someone who overmothers. Someone who doesnt allow someone to make their own decisions. Someone who smothers. I might call such behavior shrewish if I were feeling Shakespearian. I know of no feminist literature critiquing The Taming of the Shrew as an exploration of overcoming toxic femininity though Im not the most well read person I know. Perhaps its out there. I have encountered some indignation at that play as it can be seen as trucking in negative stereotypes. And maybe that can help people understand why some people including me have such a uncharitable view of the entire concept of toxic masculinity. ,FeMRADebates,d4azlu0,7,t5_2y44v

In my home life Im definitely the decisionmaker of the familyLike I said before youre not following the dogma right. If you were following the dogma right then these two examples would be good examples of toxic masculinitypatriarchyoppression. The fact that you dont see them as illustrative of toxic masculinity does not necessarily mean that they arent  it means that you have not understood and followed the protagonists from your side who say that they are. eg from Wikipediagt hegemonic masculinity is a concept popularized by sociologist R.W. Connell of proposed practices that promote the dominant social position of men and the subordinate social position of women. Conceptually hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant social roles over women and other gender identities which are perceived as feminine in a given society.gt As a sociologic concept the hegemonic nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of cultural hegemony by Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci which analyzes the power relations among the social classes of a society. Hence in the term hegemonic masculinity the adjective hegemonic refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a social group claims and sustains a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchySo if you as a man take a leadership and decision making position at work and home you are participating in the class of men who keep women under various forms of control and perpetuating this societal dynamic and normalizing it.

If you ask a European person what country theyre from theyll probably be delighted to tell you about it and apparently Im not American Asians have a tendency to get grumpy over it.Since there is basically no harm in not asking someone what country theyre from and no way to know their reaction before asking one might as well use the vague probability base on race to guide ones choices when nothing else is available.However with everything that actually matters such as judging a persons life or the validity of their experiencearguments concerning an important matter Id say that more rigor is required and we cant depend on the quick heuristics our brain so loves to apply to everything.As for this gtOn the other hand a stoic perspective would teach that how aggravating that kind of question is assuming its not hostile or bigoted depends entirely on the interpretation the person puts on it. Unfortunately a lot of social justice narratives are antistoic in this sense and suggest bigotry where ignorance would do just fine.I entirely agree. Learning about and trying to apply Hanlons razor has made me so much happier.

8044607,0,t1_d4jwvuq,Its only very recently in science terms at least that weve actually found out that there are these differences.  Now that people are beginning to study it were finding differences in a whole bunch of places.  For example it turns out that heart attack symptoms in women can be totally different and not be any of the classic onesSo first why is all this work done primarily men?  A couple reasons I can think of off the top of my head. Male disposability makes them the prime choice for trials of things that may or may not be a good idea.  This is less relevant these days but shouldnt be discounted for older research.  Also there are more men floating around willing to join random trials of things.. Women are harder.  The existence of menstrual cycles makes checking for side effects harder than it could otherwise be.  Significantly.And this isnt really a reason for using men but for only providing nongendered results  if we assume that everyone is the same we can pool the data  so even when men and women are both used the data isnt present in a way that allows us to differentiate between the groups.OK so should we just go make sure to test everything on women as well?  Well... um... honestly Im going to be pragmatic here and say no.  At least not entirely. Clinical trials are very difficult and expensive.  Have you ever noticed how many things arent rated for use on children?  That in significant part is because children are well known to respond differently to things what with that growing thing... which means they need separate trials.  If there doesnt appear to be a very compelling reason to use it on children its not worth the effort to get that study done.Anyway the point is that clinical trials are hard and expensive.  If we say that men and women are independent we now need to independently prove efficacy and safety as well.  And like that youve nearly doubled the cost of bringing a drug to market.  Also what about other kinds of studies Do you want to closeto halve the effectiveness and amount of research we can do?So while I agree it would be nice to study this I think we have quite a lot of much bigger problems deserving funding.  Id like to see gendered retrospectives done based on inthewild use in the first couple years of deployment as a doublechecking measure but I dont think its appropriate to spend the effort required to preemptively do fully gendersplit studies every time we study something.,FeMRADebates,d4kagax,3,t5_2y44v

Women dont get raped because of what they wear. That is a myth that feminists like to harp on but it doesnt happen in reality. Rapes usually occur when people are drunk and fill in the blank. Rapes arent more common at the beach. In America nudity is connected with intimacy. We dont have a culture where friends get naked with each other. It just looks like a circus when women walk naked down the streets with alternating signs about sluts and rape culture. These rallies arent about actually stopping rapes.

Do you believe representations of weapons in toy sets just bring out playful aggressive behaviour thats already in those kids or do you believe they have formative effect on children?At worst its an healthy outlet. Wanna punch someone? Go play your PS Lego game and punch Lego Batman destroy bricks etc.It has as much formative effect as rough tumbling play has. Its something physical involves problem solving adrenaline and little danger. Kittens also do it instinctively.gtDo you believe weaponsviolence in toys or childs play represent masculinity? Toxic masculinity even?Not really. Theyre often a narrative tool. If you want a story that involves heroes and villains and its not Doctor Who therell be violence even in Doctor Who there is violence the Doctor himself just doesnt use weapons.gtIs a Lego set without weaponsviolence a feminine toy? A toy that boys are less likely to prefer? If the toy involves no action it might be less preferred. I personally dont see the attraction to salon Lego Friends sets and playing pretend about going  hours doing nothing while someone plays in your hair. Theres no action involved not even pretend action.gtWhat is a normal gender neutral toy and which are the criteria a toy must not have in order to be gender neutral? not pink? no weapons?I think the regular city Lego or Basic blocks are pretty neutral. I also think most franchises even if theyre marketed to boys are neutral. Hero stories are not uniquely masculine. Whereas feminine toys about going to a salon and playing dress up are considered uniquely feminine.A woman can become a hero even one who breaks a few jaws even if getting the muscle may be harder without testosterone. A man has few fashion options without becoming an outcast a weirdo. Regardless of his degree of desire to express himself through clothing and hairstyles he wont have the opportunity to in most fields. So if a boy is attracted to the pretend play of it its likely due to not being able to do it for real rather than rehearsal for later.Until that changes boys are men are allowed much much more freedom of expression without being fired not hired or killing their romantic prospects appearancebased stuff will be seen as uniquely girly.,FeMRADebates,d4upf4g,1,t5_2y44v

Its pretty scary when people with beliefs like yours get into power since your theory is a justification for oppression of the other if we dont oppress them they will oppress us is a logical response if you believe that people can only interact by trying to oppress the other.Broke the following Rules No personal attacks Full Textgt Accidentally? Its absolutely incredible how you literally just demonstrated that you have internalized excuses for boys behavior towards girls which is literally what boys will be boys means.I meant accidentally in the context of what society wants boys to do. From the perspective of the cultural conditioning the goal is to get boys conditioned to stand up to boys not to use violence against women. So it is an unintended side effect accidents that happen despite social conditioning trying to prevent it although conditioning boysmen to be hyperagent is more important.gt Girls by the way are taught not to hit anyone. Aggression is overall intensely discouraged in girls regardless of who the target of their aggression is.Yes they get taught hypoagency.gt Girls and boys have essentially the same strength so it actually makes no sense at all to enforce this rule on children. Social conditioning is not intended for kids itself but to create the wiring so men and women act as desired after growing up.You cant condition kids one way and then when puberty happens press a button and flip that conditioning. It doesnt work that way.gt It would make vastly more sense to teach children not to hit anyone who is weaker than they areNo because the goal is to condition men to help and protect women regardless of their size strength and ability. Men are not supposed to make a judgement call at all but to act on identity alone. Its because its considered so important to prevent women from getting hurt that men are simply not allowed to fail by assuming that women can take care of themselves ever.gt So theres actually no reason whatsoever to teach boys not to hit girls except to enforce gender roles on them.Well the goal is to enforce gender roles because gender roles are based on stereotyping and thus dont take outliers into consideration.gt The myth of gender parity in domestic violence has been debunked repeatedly.Im afraid not. Selfreported figures consistently find nearly equal rates and in fact lesbian relationships have way more domestic violence than hetero relationships which debunks the idea that female violence is merely defensive. The only real difference is that violence against women is harsher which is probably due to men being stronger and bigger on average.gt Um... the more you view someone as an object rather than as a person the more youre going to treat them as if they do not have the rights that a person has? Thats a pretty easy connection.Yes but the theory that only women are treated as objects is based on a biased theory that only considers it objectification when people are judged by the metrics of the female gender role. Furthermore the idea that only men do it to women and thus men are oppressing women is easily debunked by the large amount of body shaming and making thin bodies the norm that happens by women.gt The evidence still shows that even teachers who believe theyre doing a good job giving students equal opportunities to excel call on boys more give them more time to talk etc.Again that teaches hyperagency. But men do way worse in education at all levels now so your theories simply fails. How can it be possible that men get treated better in education and yet they do so much worse??? That is simply not a rational belief.gt Also its accepted now that the reason so many more boys are diagnosed with ADHD is because the studies on ADHD to determine the symptoms were done on young boys and so by virtue of not knowing how the symptoms manifest in young girls fewer girls get diagnosed.At most that is a theory held by some. Its not the consensus view of scientists.gt All people have the tendency to maintain and increase their own power including their power over others some just get the chance to do so.Oh its even worse. You think that everyone is evil. Its pretty scary when people with beliefs like yours get into power since your theory is a justification for oppression of the other if we dont oppress them they will oppress us is a logical response if you believe that people can only interact by trying to oppress the other.However I have to note that your theory doesnt actually explain why people would oppress along gender lines. Wouldnt it make much more sense to oppress by gene similarity and thus have your familyclancountry oppress others rather than oppress those close to you with similar genes?gt The optimization of work in farming actually had nothing to do with strengthFarming was really hard work before we had machines. Do you deny this? Andor do you deny that men are on average stronger than women? If you dont deny either then your objection makes no sense.gt This meant women were relegated to being pregnant a whole gosh darn lot of the time which meant they werent farming.You seem to be unfamiliar with the lack of reliable contraception in the past the high child death rate the lack of pensions and thus need for children to take care of the old etc. Its pretty obvious that high birth rates are for many more reasons than just power.Your entire theory falls apart just by looking at how birth rates quickly fall when migrants move from a country with a very small safety net to countries that have one. If the only reason for high birth rates was power then the evil colonialist power hungry westerners would have the highest birth rates of all. Yet they dont.gt but because men had the chance to increase their own power which all human beings are naturally inclined to do.So why do and did so many women go along with this system rather than revolt? After all a decent number of women support patriarchal ideas and not at all reluctantly go along with it they enforce it just as hard as patriarchal men. Again your theory fails when looking at reality.gt Private prisons rich people can afford Its interesting how you have your own reality. Private prisons in the US dont actually get funded by inmates who pay for privileges and thereby fund the system. They are funded through the state and the prison seek to make money by housing cheap convicts and cutting costs which has resulted in  more violence between inmates.So an expensive lawyer of a smart rich inmate will try to keep himher out of private prisons and seek to get himher housed in lowsecurity governmentrun facilities.,FeMRADebates,d4xqvjq,1,t5_2y44v

8227564,0,t3_4s2axr,gtBoth men and women have reproductive rights and responsibilities.They both dont have them to nearly the same extent though.gtWhile it is true that after conception a woman has more control than a man over the decision whether to bear a child and may unilaterally refuse to obtain an abortion those facts were known to the father at the time of conception. The choice available to a woman vests in her by the fact that she and not the man must carry the child and must undergo whatever traumas physical and mental may be attendant to either childbirth or abortion. Any differing treatment accorded men and women ... is owed not to the operation of state law but to the operation of nature.This is the most intriguing copout thats always posited.The men arent complaining that they cant receive an abortion. That indeed is a product of biological reality that law has no part of.What they complain of is being held liable for this choice. Conception does not create a child according to the legal system a child is created by birth and it is only women who can choose to do that. The process that holds men accountable for womens reproductive choices is legal not biological.Its also interesting that the courts characterize a womans potential choice to produce a child as a justification for his liability to it. Men dont always give women their semen for the purpose of reproduction. Simply because reproduction is something she can choose to do with it doesnt mean that he should be considered liable.If I give you a few tons of lumber free of charge and you decide to build a house with it should I be said to own half of the house along with its liabilities like property tax simply because building a house is something that you could have conceivably done with my gift?No. Thats nonsense. I have no faith in a judicial appeal to create mens postconception reproductive rights. The courts have already established the jurisprudence of parents being liable to their children on a genetic basis no matter what the context even if the father was raped. The courts have repeatedly affirmed that they do not care what injustices this principle imposes upon men. They have made it overwhelmingly clear that they are infinitely more concerned about supporting womens reproductive decisions than they are in protecting men. Im pretty sure that it would be virtually impossible to overturn such an entrenched judicial precedent or it would have been done by now.The only way to fix this is through legislation. Some kind of federal statue that explicitly defines a principle for liability to children so such a thing isnt left up to the courts to decide. This principle would define liability based upon which party possessed the legal authority to operate whatever aperture biological or artificial to the exclusion of parties who had no authority. This would not only solve the problem for biological child birth but will preemptively solve it for when artificial wombs come about. Such a statute would protect people who dont own artificial wombs from those that do. Liable parenthood for those who do not own the reproductive process that produced the child in question would become contractual.What happens when technology advances such that its practical for almost anyone to extract an egg out of a woman during sex? Should she be held liable if a man does this fertilizes it himself and then creates a child from it with his own artificial womb? Should she be held liable for his reproductive choice? I think not.The standard of liability and rights for and to children needs to be reformed and this can only happen through legislative action. Judicial appeals are worthless. Hopefully in  years when Roe v. Wade begins to show signs of weakness and failure when it comes to protecting womens abortion rights once artificial wombs are practical and economical womens abortion rights are going byebye hopefully the mens movement will have gained enough of a hold in the culture to demand this reform alongside the rework of Roe v. Wade that will inevitably need to happen in order to protect womens abortion rights from the steady march of technology.Thats the only way I can ever see this happening. Then we can close the chapter of women owning a monopoly on postconception reproductive rights and add it to the addendum to gender studies courses exploring societies apathy towards mens vulnerabilities.Well at least one can dream.,FeMRADebates,d5602ow,18,t5_2y44v

What I absolutely will not tolerate is being told that I need to treat myself as a potential rapist to accommodate someone elses prejudice towards me.The classic example is womens only gym hours. Im barely ever at the gym but it still gets me fuming every time I think about it.

Its not that they dont care its that theyre not aware of. Feminists have spent over a hundred years telling society women have issues. There hasnt been an equivalent movement for men until very recently. But now people are becoming increasingly more aware men have issues too. If people inherently didnt care about men as men we wouldnt be seeing any improvement at all.gt Workplace fatality and injury isnt a gendered issue because men arent the sole victims. Its a workers rights issue. The fact it disproportionately affects men is irrelevant. Internet harassment however is a gendered issue because despite the fact that men and women get harassed at near parity women feel more harassed.Yes I agree with you here but its not a universal phenomenon.

The First French Republic was the second nation that adopted universal male suffrage doing so in  it was one of the first national system that abolished all property requirements as a prerequisite for allowing men to register and vote. Greece recognized full male suffrage in  and France and Switzerland have continuously done so since the  Revolution for resident male citizens. Upon independence in the th century several Latin American countries and Liberia in Africa initially extented suffrage to all adult males but subsequently restricted it based on property requirements. The German Empire implemented full male suffrage in citation needed. The United States theoretically adopted full male suffrage with the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in citation needed but this was not practically implemented in the South until the Voting Rights Act of .gt In  New Zealand became the first nation in the world bar the shortlived th century Corsican Republic to grant universal male and female adult suffrage. In most countries full universal suffrage followed about a generation after full male suffrage. Notable exceptions in Europe were France where women could not vote until  Greece  and Switzerland  in federal elections and  in all cantonal elections. It is worth noting that countries that took a long time to adopt womens suffrage were often actually pioneers in granting universal male suffrage.Youre complaining that first male DV centres started appearing  years after first female DV  centres had while women in Switzerland barely became able to fully vote  years ago.Lets talk about education too.

If we learn how to deal with an emotion it is internal and subject to change through empowering families and teaching children if we instinctively chose one or the other it is external and we are incapable of change Except through inhumane or nonexistent yet still unethical methodsA i didnt rule it out i never did but socializationenvironment dont negate agency.gtId like to note that in pointing out lesbian violence against me youve implied that this is a problem lesbians should deal with as if its not environmental factors Of which are deliberate but I can only assume is meant to be taken as inherent.No i was simply point that the belief that women are axiomatically assumed to be less violent than men is wrong. i see no reason to assume that much less take it as an axiomatic statement.  what i would stipulate is that violence from women even in lesbian arrangements is seen as a less serious than violence from men and thus does not get addresses or get fetishized as hot or becomes a punch line.gtWhen I talk about male violence I talk about the socialization of violence and dominance in media aimed at men which raises boys with a negative message. I have never implied that men are inherently violent. that is what separates feminist and sociological analysis from certain other groups. For us it is awareness to change and better society for others it is simply an attack not meant to change or help but to say that You are flawed human beings implicitly.Typically male violence tropes also include that it be righteous and self sacrificial and play into male disposablity and damsel in distress tropes. I mean A why should am an risk his life to save anyone? Why is the woman a damsel? why are these roles rarely inverted. Why is a women assume to have lesser agency than a man? i know this is all bush league  gender studies  stuff but still. an no i dont find patriarchal values to be particularity sufficient explanation.gtWhen a feminist says White men they mean The culture of entitlement which is changeableNo this conflates class with race and gender go to kentucky and tell me how privileged white men are. go to the veitnam memorial tell how privileged they were. I mean the white feather campaign largely targeted poor white men as did the draft in the civil war. this also ignores that we see way more men at the bottom of distributions for success than at the top and we see way mroe women clustered around the middle. i believe this to be an aspect of puttign men in the role of hyperagent where few resources are freed up to help the poor and the destitute because they are got there under there own volition rather than have narrowed field of choices to make to reach the top with wider gaps between the rungs. But the ones that do make typically make it because of that lack of support and do or die environmental conditioning. Also men are not protected from there own risk taking which mean they get better at take risks than women do typically simply because they have to suffer there own agency more so than women.gtwhen an antifeminist says Women they have often meant The born woman the woman with free will as an agent is equally and irreversibly flawed Which is why I find the Man hating feminist trope to be laughable because even Andrea Dworkin never said menSome thing some thing man hog tied with a steleto in his mouth?gtare inherently bad and even spoke against such being spouted unintentionally by her opponents.Pretty sure she said some thing about all hetrosexual sex being rapegtSocialization begets behavior. As a hated group lesbians are socialized negatively by society and media.Ugh i seem to recall gay bashing of gay men being more an issues i understand lesbian were frequently committed. But im pretty sure being committed is less bad than being beaten half to death. Hell even in Islamic texts text which are not so great for the women folk i might add only male homosexuality is chastized by a death sentence. I red all three islamic books in addition to teh bible and the torah amp talmud only male homosexuality is punished.gtIt is common for the association to be made.From what i have seen gay male character are pink coded as evil way more than lesbian character. It really not some thing i have seen all that much off TBHgtAlternatively men are socialized with a sense of importance and assertiveness over women.Not from what i have seen if any thing its a protective reverence for women with women having little to no responsibility for the own safety at least in media portrayals. I mean in order to protect some one you need them to follow some orders. if anything its typically a gilded cage.gtMen see man prefixed to positions of powerBecause men are seen as agents and women arent women are cast as victims martyrs or some thing that needs protection. Also men face an expectation of being assumed to be supremely competent and being shamed for not being competent where as culturally and in media a women being supremely competent is plus but not requirement cheerleader effect.gtmen see walls covered in other important men read about men in their booksyet you never here about the men who they stepped on or sacrificed to get there they are statistic not people.gtwe as a collective of societies have very strong gender roles in our cultures which are being slowly eroded by progressive measures.Actually we see mroe gender noncomforming behavior in more traditional societies which are typically less prosperous and free. I think its because duty is more firmly and equally ingrained as an aspect of community and culture.gtId think most people would be on board with this but here we are.I mean i think most people would be more on board with meeting more in the middle between femininity and masculinity.from The second link Ok i get that is not great to have the first few appearance of lesbians s being coded evil. but there is an up side as there is with most things. those shows all portray women as more agents which is some thing that is still lackign in media today. Men are typically portrayed as agency sink from which all good and bad morality flows. So while not great representation for lesbian it did  push the ball forward in acknowledging womens moral agency and breaking the women are wonderful affect. which is good for women because it get women out being seen as victims but as actors of both good and evil.gtLesbian gay bisexual and transgender characters were well welcome in film throughout history but the Hays code and people at the time never did want to erase it because they most likely knew that some people will be gay regardless of the media you feed themI mean moral puritan typically are the worst bigots whether they are left right or center.,FeMRADebates,d5hx7pt,3,t5_2y44v

8427475,0,t1_d5uypmo,The only way I can see quotas being fair is if there were already enough women applying for the job and a quota would encourage employers to choose an equally qualified female candidate over male candidate. But I doubt it could work in practice. Theres no such thing as two  identical people  one of them is always going to have an edge for the job even if its a small edge. And if there were already enough women applying there wouldnt be a need for quota  I always get the impression that its not like  women and men are applying to those top positions or engineeringcomp sci jobs or another maledominated area but somehow the result is  women and men. Usually its that not enough women apply in the first place. I dont see how quotas would make more women apply unless the employers were actively hunting for women  and in that case it would be racism and most likely wouldnt attract all the best female candidates for the job. However if its really that tons of women are applying but they get disproportionately turned down theres a problem with sexism that quotas cant solve. Its like putting a bandaid it doesnt actually solve the root cause. If at some company women get disproportionately turned down for no good reason then that company is sexist. If you forced that company to accept women they would just be marginalised and treated unfairly anyway because you cant force sexism out of people  you can only educate it out of them.This very idea IMO not only infantilises women in the end it would be detrimental for everybody and it doesnt solve the root cause of the lack of women in those areas.,FeMRADebates,d5uz4xh,14,t5_2y44v

Why were the women excluded from what was regarded as most important endeavor in their subculture had it not been for a phenomenon we call... sexism?And even in Japan and in China I wonder how sexed the learning culture was.

For whatever reason and for better or for worse when Im good and sober I tend to avoid saying things that are generally untactful even in situations where its probably okay  just in case.  I am almost certain I probably worry too much about that sort of thing to the point where its sometimes hilariously socially enfeebling.  I guess I have my own biases and assume that some people based on vibes I get from simply their Reddit comments are going to be as careful as I try to be as in to a fault.  And sometimes Im surprised when theyre not.  And hey this is the internet so I figured I might as well ask someone what they were thinking and see if I can raid someones brain for insight! My apologies if I derailed the whole conversation.  FWIW I really appreciate you posting this to begin with.  I hadnt read that blog comment before and while my experience hasnt quite been so extreme I have absolutely had elements of it.  I didnt forgive myself for having sex for the first time for about a year and a half  I was utterly convinced that I had raped my thengirlfriend even though she insisted the entire time that it was consensual.  Im pretty sure we broke up at least in part because I couldnt accept that what I did wasnt bad.  I never loudly bragged about losing my virginity  when I told people it was like I was confessing a crime.  Granted we were young but entirely legal... This whole thread is verbalizing a lot of feelings I had then and never realized were common or persisted for some people into adulthood.  And the more I think about it I am still affected by it as an adult at least a little.  A few years ago I got really drunk  really drunk  and straight up passed out on a girls bed.  She had happily brought me home into her house after partying with me all night and had also previously been very touchyfeely with me although not that night.  I woke up in the morning with her having crawled into bed as the little spoon.  After we were both awake for a bit clearly happy to be in the situation we were in I just barely kissed the back of her head ever so lightly.  Then she got up and asked if I wanted breakfast and we hung out chatting for a few hours.  And thinking rationally that was probably that.  But for some reason there is this emotional narrative stuck in my head that I did something terribly invasive and wrong in that situation.  If you asked me what exactly I did wrong Im not sure I could say.  But I have this brooding sense of guilt every time I run into her or her friends as though Ive secretly assaulted her which doesnt make any fucking sense at all.  Literally what I did was not assault her not be pushy be immediately and completely responsive to any and all signs that I shouldnt pursue anything further etc....And now I ranted.

8726197,0,t1_d6vyfd1,This is a thoughtful comment and I agree to some extent. But I think the cause is a bit different than what you suggested gtI often have the reflection that feminism has ruined motherhood for a lot of women.I agree that motherhood has come to be viewed as somewhat of an unfair burden on women rather than as a noble profession but I disagree that its due to feminism I see feminism as more of an effect rather than a cause. Instead I think the cause of this shift was more a combination of rampant capitalism and or technological advances. Parenting always was and still is important work but the other aspects of housekeeping used to be respected because they were vital for survival cooking food for everyone on a farm was hard and also vital work as were canning pickling making soap cleaning and mending clothes managing the home garden and tending the chickens and dairy.  Most of those tasks have been replaced with technological advances and with easily accessible products. Why take hours making bread every day from scratch when you can buy a loaf of bread for not much more money?  The worth of a housewife in terms of monetary value is relatively low now most of the work she can do is cheap enough to replace. In other words many of the jobs of the traditional housewife have been outsourced to Campbells and Wallmart and taking care of the home purely by hand seems like a frivolous luxury rather than a respected necessity. I think feminism arose because many women realized that their ability to contribute to the home had diminished. Meanwhile mens work outside the home was obviously still valued by society in measurable terms monetary compensation. Society has always celebrated the labors of men but is womens work celebrated at the same level? If it isnt then why wouldnt women want to leave the home to do work that is valued by society rather than for stay home and be viewed as her husbands dependent?  It wasnt some sinister conspiracy of selfish feminists who convinced women that making money was good and having kids was bad but rather a capitalist system which rewards the labor that produces money for the wealthy and disrespects the emotional and childrearing labor that doesnt benefit a companys bottom line. I dont actually think capitalism is evil altogether its a very efficient system for evaluating certain types of value. But its atrocious at evaluating and rewarding value that cannot be easily translated into dollars.,FeMRADebates,d6wf0rs,2,t5_2y44v

8760197,0,t1_d70j9pb,gt I dont pretend women dont have additional options men dont have. But to say men have zero control whatsoever is incorrect.Yeah sure. We all have control of our choices and inputs. But this does not mean men have enough choice to be making a realistic decision. They are being told go without sex or risk parenthood. It makes the decision to avoid parenthood a lot less realistic. gtThe question here is control whether someone has some control not whether someone has more control than the other or one has options the other does not.Asking if they have any choice at all isnt really helpful we need to be talking about realistic choice. And realistically guys dont have a choice here. gtDoes paternal surrender ONLY apply to women? It depends on the state a lot are gender neutral but certainly not all because they were built for women to use. But we have to look at how it plays out in reality. Like Schala said its very possible for the mother to not inform the father impossible to not inform the mother. Gender neutral services often dont cut it when they are playing into natural gender differences. I mean nothing is stopping men from getting literal abortions either they dont have to because its not going to happen. It doesnt mean men have equal family planning options. gtParental surrender doesnt let someone get off the hook AFTER they threatened to kill their childSolid point. So this would be more analogous to a bunch of guys killing their kids to get off child support getting away with it and then the state giving men LPS to prevent further deaths.

If the parents are unable to come to an agreement both face the burden of going through the court system.gtIn general our evidence suggests that the courts hold higher standards for mothers than fathers in custody determinations...Family service officers probate judges and appellate judges all say that giving primary consideration to the parent who has been the primary caretaker and psychological parent is in the best interests of children. In practice however it appears that as soon as physical custody is contested any weight given to a history of primary caretaking disappears. Mothers who have been primary caretakers throughout the childs life are subjected to differential and stricter scrutiny and they may lose custody if the role of primary caretaker has been assumed however briefly and for whatever reason by someone else.

Yes or no on that?I would argue that the s gender roles were in place for the wealthy before that era but what made the nuclear family type well known is how common it was in the middle class. I agree that it was not prevalent among poor. It started because of the suburban build up due to the GI bill for the WW era and it caused a growth in the middle class. This middle class growth also caused a huge advertising demographic to form which further solidified gender roles.Yes gender roles do not exist in the same form when survival is at stake.Well sure part of the gender roles of many societies was the ability to take a wife who did not have to work because this indicated high classstatus which also influenced beauty standards. The biggest factor was class.In the renaissance women with pale skin were seen as beautiful because they did not have to toil in the fields. In Chinese culture it was small dainty feet which caused massive amounts of foot binding which messed up many feet. Nondefined muscle structure long nails clothing that restricted movement were also part of these traits at various points of time. In modern times South Korea and South America have an exploding market for cosmetic surgery.Note how most of these beauty standards in various societies are all indicative of not having to work?The s just had a very definable gender role setup because of the massive prevalence in that era due to the exploding of the middle class.

9042767,0,t1_d7ynw6h,I can appreciate the fact that the strict academic definition of the term toxic masculinity is what you say it is and that its not an attack. And I think we can all recognize and accept that the term is just vague enough that some people actually do use it as an attack and that the men who perceive it as an attack might be doing so because theyve only ever seen it used as an attack. But I think whats more useful to talk about here as in the depressionrelated article I was originally commenting on is responsibility if a term that you use is consistently misunderstood or misinterpreted by the people youre trying to reach with that term then by a purely linguistic metric you have failed to communicate. That is to say the failure is the speakers not the listeners. Its great that we can acknowledge that toxic masculinity has the potential for misinterpretation but if we then go on to say that its mens responsibility to stop misinterpreting itand not feminists responsibility to come up with a different term that cant be misinterpreted in that waythen were just reinforcing the narrative that miscommunications between men and women are always mens fault because men are overly literal and women are gifted with language. Or whats better I think is that we can let men come up with a term themselves just like we do for other groups. For example I was recently in the American Southwest and several people told me that the indigenous population there dont like to be called Native Americans and they much prefer to be called Indians. I was surprised by this having grown up in the liberal Northeast because Indian is a misnomer and Native American was drilled into my head as the more accurate and sensitive nomenclature. But if I then went on to address an indigenous person in that region others in different regions might well feel differently as a Native American and when they protested I calmly explained to them that Native American doesnt mean what they think it means and Indian is a thing that doesnt actually exist thatd be pretty insensitive of me right?

9233291,0,t1_d8mbyrl,I think for me a better way of putting it is that when youre looking at identitybased stereotypes do you believe that theyre largely derived via antagonism of the other or through replication of patterns of identification. Honestly most of the times I look at data on this stuff its generally always into the later. But when I talk about the oppressoroppressed stuff that position is largely the former. The reason for my position on that is that stereotypes dont seem to disappear when theyre not between two identity groups. Are they lessened? Yes. Im not saying that othering plays no role. I just think othering has a relatively low impact generally speaking. Again malefemale is weird in that sometimes the stereotype effect is larger when talking about the same group I actually agree that when talking about raceclassetc. that generally the privilege dynamics are overwhelmingly onesided...but again theres a difference between being overwhelmingly onesided and entirely onesided.

How much was spent in making promises and setting goals that continually lapsed?We dont know that and much more importantly for this discussion we cant prove any of that. The post to which I originally replied compared two situations that look much the same by their objective facts. The differences are in the atmosphere things that cant be sufficiently provable.gt Violence is offlimits while extortion and misappropriation of funds are joint decisionsNo extortion nor misappropriation to any legally relevant meaning was a part of the two examples we discussed. Youre introducing new elements now.gt it was instantly the SAH partners joint decision for the working partner to embezzle all of their savings into an anonymous offshore account that nobody seems to currently know the path to as well.Again what the...?! I dont understand the background logic of the examples youre coming up with. Theyd both need access to that money and the original transaction would need to be based off both signatures for everything to be unambiguously in the clear here and undisputedly joint. Furthermore this money would likely constitute marital assets even if formally in name of one of them and unlike individual property brought into the marriage this stuff does get divided in case of a divorce. Yes the party manipulating with tangible and tangibly divisible joint marital assets would have legal trouble  for a reason  and from what I understand this stuff is normally provable and trackable to a great degree anyhow. Gone are the good old days when you could just open an anonymous account in Switzerland or when it was impossible to make a bank from another country give any information about clients for court purposes ever there would be paper trail pertaining to the original transaction in the first bank and pertaining to who unilaterally picked the money that disappeared with what date etc. Additionaly you really think this stuff is so easily manipulable with for an average Joe? An average Joe doesnt even handle sums significant enough for this conversation to have much sense. While Id certainly agree that there is a peculiar form of financial vulnerability into which the SAH spouse is placing himself there are some protections for that reason and alimony is a part of the picture here.On the other hand how are you going to prove that somebody wasnt a good spouse absent anything illegal? Good to what definition? Or that somebody didnt do his duties informally agreed upon? Not like theres any kind of baseline of reference to begin with. Not like any of what was brought up as examples of bad SAH spouse behavior in and of itself constitutes a fault.We also havent addressed the very real possibility of charges of being a bad spouse being used as a weapon against the SAH party even when they dont reflect the reality specifically in order to try and get out of paying him his his fair share once the marriage is over. Were all just assuming here that the working spouses perspective is right that hes an innocent angel whose accusations of this sort could never be a tactical game on his end in the divorce proceedings...gt I am certain that the upshot of the story is that whatever benefits the presumably female and thus stereotypically helpless and sympathetic SAH partner is a joint decision while whatever would benefit them less and the presumably male and thus stereotypically the rug under which all loose ends are swept working partner more is instantly offlimits and offtopic.Please abstain from casually imputing dishonesty to me.My argument isnt specifically and consciously optimized for whats good for the presumablyfemale party. It looks at what would be the objective facts of the two cases that were originally compared that the court would operate with. What kind of things would be tangible provable invokable as an argument how likely it would pass etc. This is what I automatically think about not how to maximize the SAH partners interest.gt But not all situations are free from them eitherI dont dispute that.,FeMRADebates,d8n65hv,1,t5_2y44v

9271330,0,t1_d895jw2,gt So your whole complaint rests not only on a judge being activist enough to say Hey I want to screw this guy over because of Public PolicyYes a judge who is hostile to child support insurance appears to be capable of doing this if he wants to indeed such a judge might view vas deferens recanalization insurance as a form of child support insurance by proxy after all vas deferens recanalization can result in forced child support payments afterwards indeed it is always a possibility and thus try finding something within the law andor within public policy to strike down this insurance contract. gt AND the insurance company selling you an illegal product that they know is illegalNo of course not rather its a situation where an insurance company reconsiders the legalityenforceability of this contract after they had already made this contract with you.gt and calling the judge after collecting money on this illegal product and trying to screw you out of payment?Couldnt a judge simply order a refund though? Or do judges have no authority to order refund payments for contracts which are invalid?gt How fucking stupid do you think insurance companies are?Well insurance companies do sometimes get sued for refusing to pay up thus some insurance companies might not be filled with the best and brightest people.gt You think they would say Sure sell this guy nut insurance but dont look at public policy again what public policy?! until later? They just break the law all willy nilly and then take themselves to court?An insurance companys opinions on the legalityenforceability of a specific insurance contract can change over time though.Also in regards to having a judge strike down such an insurance contract some of my previous arguments for this such as the unjust enrichment argument were obviously wrong indeed that I will admit. However after thinking it over some or all of the arguments below might indeed be used to strike down such an insurance contractA. For one a judge can define bodily safety as meaning bodily injury and thus declare that you have no insurable interest in the recanalization of your vas deferens because it isnt a case of bodily injury indeed ones body actually returns to a state which is similar to what it was before your vas deferens was amputated and crippled. In this regard vas deferens recanalization isnt bodily injury but rather the reversal of bodily injury.Yes a recanalization of your vas deferens certainly iscan be a case of financial injury however one doesnt necessarily have an insurable interest in a financial injury which occurs to him or her which is why child support apparently cant be directly insured as per the people on Quora.Now will a judge have to define bodily safety in such a way? No of course not! However as of right now I cannot exclude the possibility of a judge defining bodily safety in such a way.B. A judge can argue that such an insurance contract is contrary to public policy because it can destroy familiesthe family structure andor because it can make children unwanted feel like burdens feel like losses andor et cetera.Indeed considering that such rationales have been previously used in tort law in regards to wrongful birth andor wrongful conception cases why exactly cant such rationales likewise be used in insurance law?Where exactly does it state that public policy considerations such as these ones cannot also be used in insurance law?C. A judge can argue that the public policy against insuring child support directly also applies to insuring child support by proxy. Indeed such a judge can argue that insuring your vas deferens for recanalization for several hundred thousand dollars or more of course is a case of you insuring child support by proxy due to the extremely massive size of this payout relative to the actual losses suffered by your vas deferens recanalization of course andor due to the fact that vas deferens recanalization can always result in forced child support payments afterwards indeed one cannot eliminate the riskpossibility of this outcome occurring as a result of vas deferens recanalization.,FeMRADebates,d8r7hww,1,t5_2y44v

There isnt a real sense that either candidate will better the lot of men but I think its fair to say that many men probably feel that a vote for clinton may be a vote against their own selfinterest whereas trump probably represents a vote for the status quo.

9365194,0,t1_d92uru2,gt I wonder if youre using words differently than I am. To get you a sense of perspective being told to do some research on the topic when Ive linked to so much of it probably feels like how you would feel if I could tell you youre ignorant and should get an education before speaking on this topic with a straight face. But I cant do that because its pretty fucking obvious that youre educated and knowledgeable on this topic. Apparently this understanding does not go the other way.You forget Ive actually lived in black neighborhoods and watched this first hand.  I guess by research here I mean you probably should consider talking to some black people.gtLets suppose for simplicity that there are  white murderers in a M white population. Do you think that every single nonmurderer is a totally upstanding citizen?Nope.  Lets move away from murderers entirely though and talk about folks like you.  Im guessing youre not a murderer or an attempted murderer or whatever.  Just assume someone whos criminality is like you for the rest of this discussion.  Should work better.  But theyre of whatever ethnicity.  Because what youre missing here is that were talking about what its like to be black and grow up scared of police without committing crimes and what its like to deal with that.  Were not talking about this whole theyre probably criminals anyway when the police harass them thing that you keep pushing for.gtAll this to say that I think I can understand why cops would be more suspicious of blacks than of others.Were not talking suspicious here.  Were talking racist as fuck.  Whether its the recent SF texting scandal or the NYPDs stop and frisk program which mostly targetted innocent black and hispanic people this isnt just about being kinda suspicious and its not about going after murderers or wanna be murderers or anything like that.  The fact is a lot of cops just stop at skin color when determining guilt and threat levels.  Hell Ive watched plenty of cops let off white guys with warnings for things like breaking and entering while going after a black guy for littering.gtBut Im not sure what the solution to this is. The  murder increase is worrisome and means that more lives have been lost due to this increase than due to police shootings including armed victims. Btw only about  of police shootings are on unarmed peopleNo shooting should be on an unarmed person... guns shouldnt even come out if theyre not a lethal threat.   Even many shootings against armed people are often the wrong move.    Consider this one   Why close range so quickly on a person suspected of having a knife?  If theyve got a knife you hold a wide perimeter so that theres no threat staying back at least .  Mario Woods was likewise a bad shoot regardless of weapon as again they got way too close and ended up firing at a cement wall so many times its lucky they didnt catch riccochet fire... and again they just did it wrong.So whats the solution?  Well if were getting into solutions it involves better training of police look at the improvements made in Richmond CA where police violence has dropped dramatically for one thing.  If I can take down a violent individual screaming about killing me without the use of a weapon and without harming either of us surely the police can do the same.  It also involves use of body cameras use of force drops dramatically when the cameras are used.  I think it says a lot that when police know theres a witness other than themselves their behavior improves and these also protect good cops from bad charges.  A combination of community policing and recruiting police from within the communities they are policing creates a bond of trust between officers and the people they serve... this is one of the ways my team is effective.  When people know their police officers and the officers know them back things change dramatically.    Theres a lot you can do and part of why I volunteer is to show that these things can be done better.  We show off what its like when the people you work with trust you when youre not a threat it really helps that were unarmed and when your first response to serious situations is to isolate the person and talk with them instead of go straight to physical violence.  Its amazing what talking can do.But the point of all of this is not to brainstorm improvements to the police its to talk about how having a different perspective can cause you to miss what others see every day.gtEven more troublesome to me is the fact that I think this increased scrutiny will cause police to be less proactive in their interventions.Increased scrutiny mostly just decreases problems see body cameras above.  Also note that the murder rate has gone down over the last decade not up.  Single year spikes arent really important overall trends are.gtId be interested to know which state youre in but if youd prefer not to disclose Id still invite you to look up your state in The Counted theres a calendarlike thing at the top right of the page.I mostly work in California and Nevada but were not a big enough team to have a state wide influence.

I always play male avatars in games where the men dont look like they were carved from a block of cheese by accountants on their first peyote trip.  This is mostly because if Im going to look at someones butt all day in rd person Id rather look at an attractive male butt since thats what Im into.  If the male avatars are all fugly Ill play an attractive female since who doesnt want to at least be virtually hot?My avatar will die many times in many creative an entertaining way and I understand very clearly that though I might have an interest in the character they are not me.  Interestingly I know a group of teenagers who do feel like theyre their charactersavatars and take slights upon them extremely personally.

9479186,0,t3_5al6pz,Okay...First for Child Support. Where it is awarded CS should be capped at a percentage of earnings but ALSO capped at the needs of the child whichever is lower. Ordering a man whos working minimum wage or unemployed to pay money he doesnt have or needs just to survive is ridiculous but so is ordering a rich man to pay  per month. Above meeting basic needs larger payments should be voluntary. If CS doesnt meet the childs needs there should be a social safety net picking up the slack.However child support should be awarded much less frequently anyway. First CS should not be awarded if that parent did not consent to the existence of the child whether by optout or optin parents should have the right to relinquish all rights and all obligations of parenthood for a certain time period after they become aware of the childs existence. Fathers should also have their right to demand genetic testing guaranteed. Second shared custody should be the default. At this point if a parent who has previously consented to parenthood either by optin or not opting out voluntary gives up custody CS should be awarded. However if a parent seeks full custody with or without visitation rights against the wishes of the other parent and this full custody is granted then in a nofault case i.e. the parent not granted custody was not ruled to be unfit to be a parent then I dont think Child Support should be awarded. The logic is if you want the child fulltime despite your partners wishes then you shouldnt be able to deny them access to their own children and demand money from them.Now to alimony. I believe alimony should be awarded only under very limited circumstances.First divorce courts in all places should be reformed such that nofault divorce is possible. However in a nofault case the party initiating the divorce should not be able to seek alimony. If youre divorcing someone just because you stopped loving them its ridiculous that your ex should be forced to financially support you after the marriage is ended.Second if fault is established any party determined to be at fault should be ineligible for alimony. E.G. if a husband divorces his wife because shes cheating on him he shouldnt have to pay a time.Third for alimony to be awarded the party seeking it must demonstrate a lack of ability to maintain a reasonable standard of living  i.e. if you have a job and are making more than the poverty line you dont need alimony  and that the marriage was a cause of this inability to produce income e.g. if youve been out of the workplace for ten years. When alimony is awarded it should be capped based on genuine need. If you werent financially contributing to your household then tough shit you arent entitled to the lifestyle you enjoyed during the marriage. Youre getting enough to pay for basic accommodations and possibly to fund community college classes if you can demonstrate that you need them to get a job you can live on.Fourth division of shared assets should be a factor in determining effective income. For example if you and your ex agree that youll keep the house and car that should affect whether alimony is awarded.Fifth The duration of alimony payments should be capped at the length of the marriage or five years whichever is shorter. Again community college exists. If after five years you cant financially support yourself then its not because of the marriage.,FeMRADebates,d9hii2f,13,t5_2y44v

Especially on some of the issues that there is greatest concern.the current example if you think about it and analyze it actually has implications beyond just displaying hatefulness.This is something that has been analyzed by others as well such as Warren Farell but if you look at the gender gap on sentencing and bias its larger than the racial gap. This paper finds about  times bigger.gtAfter controlling for the arrest offense criminal history and other prior characteristics men receive  longer sentences on average than women do and women aretwice as likely to avoid incarceration if convictedIf you look at how society views black men and how society views men in general some of the negative attitutes towards men exist in greater abudance towards black men. Who are also seen as a generally masculine group.According to social justice dogma  when evaluating black men race and gender should be separated due to progressive stack and men being deemed more privileged than women but I think there is a combination and an interplay when it comes to black men rather than it being just one in isolation. Especially when you compare how they are doing with black women on a lot of metrics.In any case a reduction of the gender gap in say prison sentencing or college admission between men and women would benefit black men too. So actually showing how this kind of feminist opposition to men is very hateful and bigoted isnt exploiting black men as a group at all.

10112080,0,t3_5knlcz,Warning massive wall of text incoming. A tremendous wall the best.gt reaffirms the structural disposability and systemic disregard for every person who is not white male straight cisgender ablebodied and middle or upper class.I am not a Trump supporter but this idea that white straight men are the reason that Trump got elected is wrong. The reason that Trump got elected was because other groups didnt vote. You cant demonise people for using their constitutionally defended right to vote if they dont vote how you want and then the majority of people you represent didnt go out and vote. How are more progressive politicians supposed to get policies through that help minorities if they just dont go to vote? Do we ignore our democracy at that point?Secondly does someone have to be part of all of those labels? Because if not youre basically lumping together somewhere in the region of  of the American population which would indicate to me that at least at some level the democratic system is working as intended government is working with the interests of the majority of people in mind.Thirdly part of the reason that so many middleclass white Americans from middle America and the Rust belt voted Trump is precisely due to this sort of rhetoric. They turn on the news and they hear about BLM and transgender rights in NC. They read the newspaper and read a feminist opinion piece about abortion rights in Mississippi. They go on line and hear about the latest Gay Pride parade and how it was protested by white men. They see all these groups fighting for all of these causes and then they look at their lives. Stagnating wages increased healthcare costs higher unemployment college and tuition costs increasing. And they dont see anyone fighting for them. Their views are ignored or thrown aside with little consideration and accused of mansplaining or told that they should check their privilege. Im not saying that the other issues are not perhaps more pressing but when you live in a world where you seem to be forgotten when you dont have a group taking to the streets specifically for you and then demonized when you do talk youre going to get annoyed. And annoyed people want to burn everything down. Trump is the match.Finally this is the same rhetoric that fired those annoyed people up in the first place. Youre creating a monolith of white cisgendered men while decrying the creation of monoliths of minorities. Your intellectual dissonance is mindbending.gt We must also reject calls to compromise to understand or to collaborate. We cannot and will not comply. Our number one priority is to resist. We must resist the instantiation of autocracy. We must resist this perversion of democracy. We must refuse spin and challenge any narratives that seek to call this moment democracy at work. This is not democracy this is the rise of a st century U.S. version of fascism. But and heres the thing that makes me sad as a Trump hater it is democracy. Theres no way around it. You can complain all you want about the Electoral College and say But Hillary won the popular vote!. Yes yes she did. So? You cant play a game of basketball and then at the end when you lose claim you won because you changed the rules. Democracy in the US has had the EC since before anyone complaining about it was born. And while some people complained most just ignored it. And now its an issue? This is democracy with all its flaws laid bare.gt The most vulnerable both here and abroad cannot afford for us to equivocate or remain silent. Then why did they remain silent when it mattered? Why are you all of a sudden on your war horse when those very people simply did not turn out to vote to ensure that we wouldnt need to resist later on? People who didnt vote have only themselves to blame. But I didnt think he would win! Well now you know. Remember it next time. Obama smashed McCain into little pieces because progressives and leftleaning individuals wanted a change and took to the streets. They are the majority in the US but Republicans keep winning because they know how to win an election by getting people to vote.gt The threats posed by settler colonialism and empire around the globe have never been more real nor has our resolve to oppose these injustices ever been strongerErm... no. Keep your inflammatory and needlessly fearmongering rhetoric to yourselves please. Theres this time called The th Century which is the colonial period. Were not even close to that.gt Concretely within the U.S. we oppose the building of a wall along the U.S.  Mexico border and the establishment of a registry for Muslim residents.I agree. A good position to hold in my opinion.But now you have to talk to those who do want these things and convince them that they are not needed. And I said talk. Not call a racist or an Islamophobe. Talk discuss debate engage. Because if not theyre going to keep voting for Trumplike people. Getting some repealed is only half the battle you then have to fight for the opinions of those who disagree with you.But I think the art of debate is a lost art at this point by many of my fellow leftleaning people whove fallen into intellectual laziness of relying on buzzwords and derogatory terms to shut down discussion.All in all anyone who reads this will most probably fall into two categories. Those who agree and therefore already be fully on board..

10134960,0,t3_5l0zxg,Assumptions and bias can be genderrelated.  Done properly the scientific method is pretty good although not perfect at weeding them out.I applaud feminists for examining the androcentric biases in science.  They exist.  I studied anthropology in college and we had a great time looking at the hilarious misreadings of evidence that took place when it was a boys club.  Just realize that feminist thought and gender studies have the same problems for the same reasons and if it stays a girls club where mens voices are leashed and policed those problems wont go away.  A good example is Jane Goodall.  An extraordinary scientist whom I respect immensely but her female bias led to a big hole in her research that was filled by a young male assistant researcher.  Chimpanzee females form a cohesive group and they stick together most of the time cooperating with infant care and such.  The males wander off much more.  Goodall unconsciously saw the group of females with their male orbiters and followed them around observing them.  She made some assumptions about what the males were doing when they wandered off  namely that whatever they were doing was solitary and not that interesting because she never bothered to investigate the activities of these wanderers.  But a male researcher did follow them and found out that while wandered off one by one they would convene at times in a way that seemed premeditated and engaged in patrolling activities.  What he observed turned out view of chimps upside down there are still people who cling to the old view and try to trash anyone who reports on this behavior.  The male chimps if they happen on a rival band will engage in combat.  If they catch a lone rival they try to kill him.  If they find a lone female they will try to mate with her and will use force if she resists she doesnt always resist  another thing discovered is that younger females sometimes go on walkabout looking for some strange  a good way to increase genetic diversity.  So they discovered analogues for some of the nastier bits of human behavior  namely what we overwhelmingly the males do to people we dont consider part of our tribe.  It was as if Goodall had studied Rome and never followed the legions when they marched out.  This is not to pick on Goodall she did wonderful work at Gombe.  But it shows how blind spots work.  Because Goodall pioneered the studies and did much of the early work herself it was a female dominated effort.  Even when international interest spiked and she had lots of help her leadership and the influence of her early work was everywhere.  And chimp studies are especially fraught with potential for bias because they are out closest cousins and when we look at them we are as much trying to understand ourselves as we are trying to understand them.  Whoever is looking at them is always at risk of projecting what they want to see onto their behavior.  So ideally we want men and women young and old people of different political persuasions etc. In the mix.,FeMRADebates,dbsl8m7,11,t5_2y44v

What is and isnt a feminist act will always differ from person to person depending on their own definition of feminism. For instance someone working with homeless men may be seen as an act of feminism by one person and only as simple charity by another.If what she was talking about was about her as a woman doing something being the femnist act then that would be understandable. Its not what shes doing but rather that she is doing it thats one possible explination.Alternativly her definition of what entails a feminist act or cause might be overly broad. A nagging issue with feminists is that they are overextending into domians that dont have all that much to do with feminist at its core depending on definition of course. Some people have such a broad veiw of feminism that the term becomes nebulous.I would ask your friend hoe they define feminist causes and how they interpret what they are doing as a feminist act.,FeMRADebates,dcnqum0,5,t5_2y44v
10429378,0,t3_5pc7rn,gtMeasuring implicit bias is tricky  because the bias is unconscious you cant just ask people how they feel about women in a professional context or about sexist attitudes. So researchers instead run online experiments that test how quickly subjects associate typically male or female words such as boy and lady with career or family. You can take a version of the test at the website of Project Implicit a nonprofit research organization.gtProject Implicit ran this experiment with more than  online test takers from  to . The results show that conservative women had higher implicit gender bias than women with other political ideologies and than men of any political ideology according to data provided by Colin T. Smith the projects director of education at my request. At every level of selfreported political ideology women had a higher level of implicit gender bias than men.gtProject Implicits data set doesnt yet cover this generalelection campaign but another study found consistent results. In October HCD Research a New Jersey research firm enlisted about  likely voters including about  in each of four groups  Clinton and Trump supporters of both genders  in a test of implicit gender bias modeled after Project Implicits test. The result was striking. The group with the highest level of implicit bias against linking women with careers was women who planned to vote for Trump. More than  percent of them showed a bias toward linking men with careers more quickly than women compared with  percent of women supporting Clinton and a little more than  percent of men supporting either candidate. The average bias of women planning to vote for Trump was the highest of any group to a statistically significant degree.Worth noting that the implicit association test is coming under scrutiny this one from the articleIts important to remember that psychology is a field which consistently fails to replicate results. Its often tempting to use results like this to prop up a narrative women are more sexist than men or sexism elected Trump and it usually comes back to bite you.,FeMRADebates,dcq8m47,7,t5_2y44v

The sub its on having language and rhetoric that speaks to the sub being progressiveleaning further puts doubt in my mind to the authenticity of the author.Oh and it doesnt help that the entire post is describing how they overcame their false beliefs due to the words and arguments of someone else in their life yet then goes on to say its totally OK to punch nazis.

Im interested to learn a little more about it too but Ive had a lot on my plate as of late. gtIt could possibly apply to Richard Spencer as he has been quoted as advocating for genocide...A lot of people have repeated this assertion but I have yet to see anyone substantiate it. He has advocated for an ethno state but to the best of my knowledge he hasnt actually advocated that white people commit genocide. Dont get me wrong his ideas about ethnic cleansing as peaceful ethnic redistribution are suspicious but I get the feeling that he intends for them to be this way. Its one of the  Laws of Power court attention at all costs. gt...however it sounds like it would largely depend on if it was worded as a call to action or an ideological stance.Well more important than whether or not he has advocated for genocide in the past is the issue of whether or not he was advocating for genocide when he was punched. Ive watched the footage of the events preceding the sucker punch and all I saw was a man amicably answering questions and ironically enough  explaining that he isnt a Nazi.gtIt is more that if people are allowed to publicly espouse ideologies without any sign of resistance...As long as their ideological stance doesnt compel them to engage in actual violence they should be free to embrace any stance. Ive come to believe that it really is better if people are out in the open about these things because that affords the rest of us the chance to publicly address their lies. gt...that others believe are a legitimate threat to their life and freedom  they may perceive it necessary to take extreme actions in self defense.Would you not agree that because people may react this way its imperative that the media provide us with accurate information about people like Spencer? He seems to be filling a convenient role as the embodiment of all the worst that Trump supporters have to offer the better to portray a physical ambush against him by a coward  sorry I just thought that whole attack was gutless  as some kind of noble resistance against a legion of oppressors. It just doesnt bear out and news organizations that ought to be accountable to the public have gone on record telling outright lies about him despite the fact that such a thing ought to be completely unnecessary. gtThe Oklahoma City Bombing and the far right militia movements come to mind. Ill have to do some more research into the nature of sovereign citizens but to the best of my knowledge our government actively monitors these groups if they have cause to believe they may be violent. gtThe relative pacifism and the general antigun stance of the left has delayed the formation of similar groups on the left but with the increase in activity of the black bloc I fear that time may be over.That would be a damn shame but I can see it happening.

Its infuriating because I have no idea how to even begin to talk to her without utterly destroying the memory of our friendship. If she can openly endorse violence anyone can.gtIn a sense I am relying on a punch in the face to act as a chilling effect for others with the same views.It wont. Spencer is using it as grounds to galvanize his supporters. One of the first things he did after he was attacked was tweet out that because police failed to protect him perhaps he should provide his own protection? gtIt is one thing to speak when there is little to no personal cost to you but another entirely when you might face immediate and tangible retribution. If we cede the authority to decide whose words warrant tangible retribution and whose do not to a mob of ideologues then we may as well cede all of our rights to speak out against their ideology. Its one thing if a person is openly spewing out bile and a fight breaks out as a result Id like to live in a world where people like Spencer could be directly confronted without the same degree of legal recourse to pursue civil or criminal action against those who would fight them over their words.

The problem of course is that many people who want violence will try to persuade you that their actions are a form of preemptive self defense and authoritarianism is almost always heralded in by such rationales.  America became a lot less free in  with the patriot act which was justified by the war on terror for example.I think the burden of proof of such rationales need be very high because it is so prone to abuse.Neither Trump being elected president by democratic process nor Milo speaking at a college represent the kind of threat that justifies violence.  ,FeMRADebates,ddadcay,14,t5_2y44v

You essentially have a huge glut of people who are tantamount to slaves.  They make prisoner level wages and send that pittance away anyways.  They dont have the ability to assimilate with the citizens of the area and create their own microsocieties that are basically parasitic.The result  Whenever you get in a car accident better than  chance that person has no insurance and no license and just disappears.  Large amounts of people living in canyons and other wilderness areas in totally unsanitary conditions which contributes to spread of diseases that should be unheard of illegal fires that are incredibly dangerous and general pollution.  Same desperate people will steal anything that isnt bolted down so Im still ultra paranoid about living in a place where you can leave anything outside and its not gone within a half hour. The hospitals are entirely overloaded and failing financially because the vast majority of their patients neither pay nor contribute in any substantial way to the tax base.  They use hospitals for everything because they cant be turned away give fake names then disappear. Of course where you have the camps and settlements you also get drugs and prostitution which is cartel territory and thats an entire other issue.  The base problem has nothing to do with drugs though.  It has to do with being willing to basically enslave people desperate enough to think its a good deal.   Mexico does this thing where they act totally incompetent to do anything about it because they benefit from the funds being returned but if you notice Mexico is rabid about protecting their own Southern border from illegals from South America as those people burden rather than benefit them.

I have to wonder how much of social conservative horror and disdain for degeneracy stems from their own feelings of shame and self loathing that with the right conditioning they could overcome. I mean its nothing new but Im not convinced there isnt a reason that for example when porn sites do surveys the most socially conservative states are the ones watching the most gay porn or the most incest porn whatever.  Or how some of the most outspokenly homophobic people end up being found out to be gay themselves.  When it comes to casual sex... An awful lot of the old voices in the crowd rallying against it are well past their prime and many have had kids and presumably grown old enough to see their spouse grow ugly and so on.  I cant help but imagine that there is some measure of unconscious well if I cant have that kind of fun it must be wrong.And as Mr. Funky Dressup I dont actually know their name points out sure there are emotional risks to casual sex  just like there are to everything else not the least of which is long term relationships marriage and romantic love.  If were resilient enough to get over the latter  and most of us are many times over  Im pretty sure we can get over the former.I dont even personally like casual sex.  Im way more comfortable fucking someone whose body I know and vice versa and I dont really care for the cycle of performance anxiety and emotional ambiguity that goes along with a hookup.  Fuckbuddies and LTRs for me.  But to each their own.  Some people cant do the fuckbuddies without getting emotionally attached okay if you learn that about yourself then maybe stay away from it.  My best friend does not do well in LTRs and they know it and so they are up front with their partners that commitment is out of the question.  And of course I know other people who just prefer to be monogamous and old fashioned.  I know some people who have at different points cycled through alloftheabove.  Whatever to each their own.

I know a lot of women who just dont want to date bi men and if youre a bi man who is a little into men but mostly into women you might be inspired to hide that fact so women wont reject you. Men seem more secure in having a bi woman as a partner whereas women seem less so wondering What if he leaves me for a man? even though technically even a  straight guy is just as capable of cheating or of refraining from cheating as any other guy. Even aside from that it can be a real pain to admitting youre a man whos been with another man  admitting it could mean you cant give blood for instance. And theres also the unfortunate fact that some people have this idea that any guy who has been with a dude is some sort of disease vector. Another thing might be that women often enjoy feeling like their womanliness itself enchants men so they can find it disconcerting when having breasts and a vagina is no more enchanting to a guy than a penis. Last of all guys are typically way better at giving blowjobs haha so some women feel insecure about competing with that. But some straight guys feel insecure about dating bi women too worrying that another woman must fundamentally have a better understanding of how to please women. Which isnt true  if anything women have more to unlearn with each new female partner. When someones body is like yours it makes it easy to accidentally assume their body will like the same stuff your own body likes.,FeMRADebates,de4n56d,2,t5_2y44v

10931417,0,t1_de7h5ua,A father who commits suicide would be absolved of his parental responsibilities because he no longer exists. But your logic is nonetheless off here because Safe Haven laws are specifically targeting situations and scenarios in which babies end up dead. Your logic extends to absolutely everything conceivable. Any debt to any legally enforceable inconvenience. The fact of the matter is that the child hasnt decided to die and its ultimately dependent upon others namely the parents for food clothing shelter and pretty much everything else necessary for basic survival. That dependency changes things dramatically as its not selfreliant. The same cannot be said of wanting to commit suicide where the decision over your life and whether to continue it relies solely on you.Your logic requires that any responsibility imaginable can be undercut by wanting to commit suicide. You have a mortgage? Wanting to commit suicide doesnt absolve you of that responsibility. You committed a crime? Wanting to commit suicide doesnt absolve you of your responsibility either. Unless your actions will ultimately result in the death of an otherwise innocent person not yourself your responsibilities arent removed because youre suicidal. ,FeMRADebates,de7hyna,2,t5_2y44v

11097081,0,t3_5yczyz,The question I hear a lot in this thread is whether politicians should  have to make great sacrifices for their job.  I dont work in politics so I dont know much about the demands of the job but I am provisionally going to give the same answer I typically give for business leadership positions and that answer is yes.  Its just a sad truth that in competitive environments while it is definitely better to work smarter than harder its even better to work smarter and harder and also true that the best way to lead is from the front asking no more from your team than you are willing to do yourself.Obviously this sucks and I dont think that everyone should have to burn the candle at both ends pushing like a madperson but I honestly see no alternative for leaders.  In business at least and I am assuming that politics is the same.I think that this paragraph gets to the heart of the issue that women wanting to pursue leadership positions while having families need a spouse they can externalize their career costs onto.gt Of course its not just the parliament. A multitude of highpowered jobs remain utterly inconsistent with motherhood. While the past halfcentury has seen an enormous flow of women into workplaces this hasnt been matched by men taking up more caring and unpaid domestic duties.This frames it as though the responsibility for that is entirely in the hands of men and by pointing this out I dont mean to imply that none of the responsibility lies in the hands of men but I would suggest that it isnt just individual men who are reluctant to change its that as a society comprised of men and women we have been reluctant to transform the norms which exert pressure on men.  Many other posters have pointed out that there have been articles suggesting that women tend to prefer men who have similar or better education and careers.  Similarly men with good educations and careers enjoy being seen as better men than men who dont have those things and tend to reinforce that dynamic.  Because we are the way we are we tend to listen to what those men have to say more than other men.My suspicion is that change is coming slowly but surely.  Because there are more stay at home dads now than there were when I was a kid and you see it discussed more.  Those women in power with spouses who support them need to give their spouses some credit for their success and suggest to young ambitious women that what they need are partners who are happy being homemakers.  There are plenty of men who would prefer to be homemakers and find the workplace to be a rat race rather than an exciting life of opportunity so long as they believe it can work.,FeMRADebates,depuesu,7,t5_2y44v

In nearly every measurable metric women are doing better than men. If I were a space alien and knew nothing about our culture and you asked me who had it better I would say women in a heartbeat. A patriarchy that constantly backfires against men isnt a patriarchy. It doesnt exist.Perhaps itd be better to view the concept using Hegels MasterSlave Dialectic. gtHowever this state is not a happy one and does not achieve full selfconsciousness. The recognition by the slave is merely on pain of death. The masters selfconsciousness is dependent on the slave for recognition and also has a mediated relation with nature the slave works with nature and begins to shape it into products for the master. As the slave creates more and more products with greater and greater sophistication through his own creativity he begins to see himself reflected in the products he created he realises that the world around him was created by his own hands thus the slave is no longer alienated from his own labour and achieves selfconsciousness while the master on the other hand has become wholly dependent on the products created by his slave thus the master is enslaved by the labour of his slave.That is to say in placing certain structures upon the Slave Class the slave class grows to understand the power they have and the Master Class realizes the powers they lack from giving those duties to the slave class. When the slave class gains selfconsciousness through their establishment of their roles they can seize these roles that the Master class cant do and use that as a means to subvert this outcome of the dialectic.A Patriarchy that constantly backfires against men is the ultimate result of a Patriarchy. It doesnt mean it doesnt exist.

11702200,0,t1_dgmamow,This is somewhat besides the point but Id love to hear your account seeing that Im one of the people occasionally devaluing stay at home parenting.Ill take it that youve had a day job in which case what job was it and how did it compare to stay at home parenting on an hour for hour basis?Some additional questions Dont young kids  sleep during the day? What do you do all day? Isnt  months well into the time where you send them to kindergarten?,FeMRADebates,dgmgolq,1,t5_2y44v
11733594,0,t3_67fatg,Not a particularly great article to be honest though it is on the right tract. I understand there most likely was a word limit in play but the John Doe and Jane Roe story needed to be expanded on a little. Isnt that the one where he was passed out and she committed fellatio on him? How respected is the New York Post in mainstream circles?,FeMRADebates,dgq16up,8,t5_2y44v

11750877,0,t1_dgrz95l,Yes I know. Im slightly less sympathetic there because it circumcision does cause a loss of function.But disregarding that aspect I can understand why people circumcise their kids. I think it should be illegal but so long as its not I understand why people would do it and dont think that theyre terrible people for it.Humans do all kind of weird stuff to feel like they belong to their group and sometimes its stuff they shouldnt be doing. But you cant blame that on the individual trying to fit in. Or at least not strongly. The real problem lies in the cultural norms that cause these kinds of behaviour and I think the best thing to do is try and change these norms not just call people evil for following them.,FeMRADebates,dgrzp7p,2,t5_2y44v
11751219,0,t1_dgs0ved,What this article is talking about isnt nature though. Its arguably every bit as unethical as a eugenicist going around preventing people he or she thinks shouldnt be reproducing from doing so. Theyre two opposite ends of the same spectrum.,FeMRADebates,dgs13hw,3,t5_2y44v
11755821,0,t3_67kah0,Since this blew up all over reddit I might as well throw in my  cents. Most of the posters here are questioning the doxxing or why people are interested. But can we actually go over what this guy thinks? Are we all unanimous in thinking that hes a misogynist?Also of interest he did an AMA on rMensRights a few years back and came off as pretty reasonable,FeMRADebates,dgsjvo6,1,t5_2y44v
11758068,0,t3_67r4nm,I think its more likely to be less than more unless there are some radical changes to society or new technical innovations e.g. sex bots or decent toys for men. Right now the trends are toward demonizing male sexuality fewer long term relationships more men checking out of the relationship scene all together both MGTOW and single not looking in general and more male perpetratorfemale victim rape scare rhetoric. Porn has been around forever and easily accessible if not in the breadth and depth we have now so I dont see that having much of an effect.,FeMRADebates,dgst23s,15,t5_2y44v
11758882,0,t1_dgs39f7,No Im just making an example a very obvious example that I figured would slap you in the face as soon as you put down the terms American History.Remember when you ask for an example of X its intellectually dishonest to presume that all other aspects of that example are parts of the platform.  If you ask me for an example of when violence has effected political change in US history I dont have to provide you a precise example of violence doing exactly what I want or plan to do merely an example of violence effecting political change.Abandon sophistry.,FeMRADebates,dgswdkj,-1,t5_2y44v

11787361,0,t1_dgw46mu,All right all right sorry.Being entirely serious I think that if this technology does arise and become ubiquitous it will effect a sea change in sexual relations. I think certainly fewer men will seek out relationships out of sheer sexual desperation.The upshot is that men and women will become more interested in each other as people in themselves rather than a means to an end.So I hope.,FeMRADebates,dgw4xis,4,t5_2y44v

11800634,0,t1_dgxarh0,gtThat said Im growing tired of the antiPC crowd. Mostly its because they are exactly the same as the PC crowd except to the right while pretending to be to the left. Ive been accused of trying to censor people simply for suggesting people not be transphobic or the like. No twitter campaign or anything just something along the lines of is that really necessary or helpful? I guess free speech doesnt cover reactions to speech these days.Im part of the antiPC crowd myself but I find sometimes they seem more hostile towards particular opinionspositions rather than censoriousness per se. On gender and sexuality issues for instance when I try to explain that gender is a social construct is NOT an indefensible view I will get a lukewarm reception at best.It seems almost like a kneejerk reaction to anything that smells of feminism even though Im very critical of third wave feminism. Its not rational it feels tribalistic. I dont think the antiPC crowd is as bad as you say but there are tendencies towards the problems you highlight. ,FeMRADebates,dgxn5bs,8,t5_2y44v

11807754,0,t1_dgyeh4j,I mean its obviously impossible to disprove what your experience has been.But I can generally point to sources with far more influence that support the PC ideology more so than the antiPC ideology so its hard for me to draw an equivalence.,FeMRADebates,dgyg7d7,5,t5_2y44v
