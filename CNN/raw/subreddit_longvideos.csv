1324886,0,t3_298dqf,Yes the economy is going through a very difficult transition during the great recession.  However I think that concerns about debt are overblown.  What I think is really the problem is that people with money to invest aka rich people not just K owners are incredibly uncreative.Being rich is a doubleedged sword.  Its a dream come true but its also a nightmare.  Why?  Because you need to continue to work your money.  And thats for two main reasons inflation which is natural and taxes.  And these pressures on the rich are good otherwise theyd end up creating asset bubbles even greater than what weve seen.  The money needs to go into projects that are innovative and allow Americas particular skills in the global economy to be utilized maximally.But unfortunately wealthy people seem to think that all thats required is to buy up real estate. That way they can skim off the wealth and value created by a community or a citys population.  The problem is theres been too much money in housing.  Capital investors need to be very smart with what theyre doing with their money.  And sadly plenty of rich people seem to think its OK to merely sit on their money or store it in city municipal bonds.  But again if every other rich person is investing in the same thing then a bubble is created.Thats why I do believe in economic redistribution.  I think if theres any time in history when wealth gets stuck at the top then government needs to seek redistribution.  Youre seeing some of this with the recent increasing of the minimum wage in certain states amp cities.  However its done investors need to play a low better than they have been.,longvideos,ciio0dq,2,t5_2qne2
