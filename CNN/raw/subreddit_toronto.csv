As an example I work near Queen and Spadina. I had a couple errands to run on my lunch break so I took the streetcar up Spadina got off a couple stops away from College did errand  walked up to College used the transfer to get on the College streetcar eastbound got on the subway after picking up a transfer at College station got off at King did errand  hopped on the King streetcar westbound using the subway transfer got off at Spadina and walked North though I couldve taken the streetcar using the subway transfer.Dont worry too much about it though. With time youll figure out how to optimize your TTC trips either within the official limits or not as you decide.

All newspapers have a bias.  The NP and Sun are just unofficial mouthpieces of the Conservative Party in high and low brow flavour respectively.  The Globe is to the right but more centrist.  The Star is leftcentre.But Fox News?  Come the fuck on.  They publish opposing views all the time and are very concerned with being factually correct.  And as the past year has demonstrated have an unassailable track record for factual accuracy.And as for the agenda against Ford. Hes not the only politician they have taken down.  They also took down Giambrone a lefty star candidate.. It was an open secret at council for years about Fords behaviour associations and background.  No one could say anything because they didnt have proof and would have been sued into submission.  When he got elected they decided to go get the proof and expose him.

Netflix and streaming video is the future of video content. Until Netflix subscription is  anything that fills the gap is a welcome forwardthinking idea IMO.I went back and read the article again and youre right  Hoopla charges per content use. Sorry read this wrong.I maintain though that we need to look at overall costbenefit rather than looking at line items in isolation. Maybe this streaming model has other cost savings  no more buying CDs DVDs and other materials? Maybe there are other benefits too like the possibility of partnering with schools and local community centres?

Weve instituted engineering improvements crosswalk lighting school zone enhancements etc. Plus weve asked Coquitlam RCMP to clamp down a bit on the serious and risky issue of jaywalking.

Tolerance and respect only runs one way on Church Street.gtsomething like world pride which supposedly will draw hundreds of thousands of people from around the world .So you are saying that majority rules no place for minorities here  you are with us or with the Child Pornographers  to quote a fellow LBGT thinker once said  gtjust...wow.it is an apt description the LBGT social warriors have become as bad as what the say they hate that being intolerant religious folk.My not attending your church does not automatically make me a an evil immoral person that is open to be abused Rob Ford or myself not attending Gay pride does not automatically make him or me a Homophobe and open to racial epitaphs and abuse.So my response is the same no matter what side pulls it  Vic Toews saying that you are with him or the child pornographers or the LBGT crowd that you have to agree with them  or you are a homophobic white trash  I tell them both to fuck off and dont give in to blackmail      ,toronto,cf8gn6t,-30,t5_2qi63

The city put up all the money private companies constructed and operated and both shared in the revenue.Note well the city put up all the money.  And the deal proved to be poor  the city eventually nationalized the subway lines buying out the private companies.  Because duh it was obvious that this is something that should have been done inhouse.Those subways were constructed in a relatively straightforward cutandcover method dig ditch cover over it.  No skyscrapers and no deep foundations to worry about.  They were cheap.  And no company would even consider putting the money forward to do it the city had to.Modern subways need to worry about deep skyscraper foundations and are much more expensive to construct.

Toronto has high taxes stop with this per dollar of value crap unless you are willing to agree that if the prices drop so do our taxes and prices for Condos especially are showing weakness.Check out this link Pick up a calculator and then do the math.  Look at the rate per square foot in Toronto and that is just for the building it does not include the lot and in Toronto the lot is zero as it is a condo.Toronto has higher per square foot taxes than any city in the country worth living in.The reason why we have an infrastructure problem is that for the last  years the city has been run by idiots.  Every time a new lot gets built the city gets a few thousand dollars that is supposed to go into infrastructure.  For a condo the city would get a million or more.  Then after the lot is finished the lot produces net new revenue.The city has increased its tax base by s of millions and it has received billions in fees over the last  years since the boom started.Toronto Water our water rates have increased to the point where Toronto pays more for water than people in Arizona and it turns out they forgot to put those increases which were supposed to go to fixing the pipes into fixing the pipes.  Now they want another  price hike.Toronto Hydro Im not going to touch that because it is too raw.The city and its offices are managed by idiots.They spent the money in the wrong place.

466739,0,t1_cft1qnw,Youve avoided addressing my question I guess it was a good question then.For what its worth yes I have been outside of Toronto. Ive livedworked in several countries on three different continents. Ive lived way out in the middle of nowhere where cars are the only way to get anywhere and Ive lived downtown where a car is an expensive luxury and not at all necessary for a rich amp fulfilled life. Does that answer your question?Public transit in Toronto is inadequate. It is bursting at the seams. That means we need to pay for more of it. Paying for transit helps you even if you never take it. Keeping the eastern portion of the Gardiner where it is for another  years or so is not a solution. Why should we pay such vast sums of money just to save  minutes for the  of commuters who will be affected when that money could pay for an LRT line in Scarborough or whatever and help way way more people?So back to what you saidgt Nothing beats being able to drive once in a blue moon time is money cars save timeand again I ask why dont we all just drive then?

526268,0,t1_cfzt1he,Youre right about that. The only thing is the people that are a lost cause continue to bring down certain neighbourhoods. Im from the west end Martin Grove and Eglinton Ave W area or Richview as its known. That area is known for trouble and because of some of the people who live in that area it makes things worse for others. There have been a lot of murders in the area too but they all happen in one specific part but again it taints the entire neighbourhood. In terms of transit options for Richview theres  East Mall  Martin Grove  Kipling  Eglinton West and  Lawrence West. The highway is right there so its easy to get on and off if need. The schools might not be best but theres a lot of schools for kids and teenagers to attend. Local plazas for groceries doctors banks LCBO... all that stuff. Heck even Pearson Airport is just a ten minute drive from there. The neighbourhood has the potential to be one of the better ones but the select few ruin it. A friend of mine lives in one of the troubled areas and they are always trying to make the place better. Planting flowers fixing things up but people fuck shit up and rip out the flowers. They put up signs people knock them down replace the bus shelter people break the glass... Its really a lost cause that ruins everything around it.

Not increase them.The law here is explicitly indicative of protectionism and this directly relates to the bigger issue of police budgets which itself is related to accountability and conduct.Edit for those who think that this isnt to do with police budgets I would argue that these costs constitute an unofficial police budget as most of these paid duty gigs are mandated by law. And all costs are borne by you and I  the taxpayer  who have no say in these costs. And since these costs involve public servants in whom a huge degree of power and authority over us is vested then I would further argue that police costsbudget both official and unofficial are intimately connected to accountability.

Taking that into consideration whats wrong with having a common identity with your neighbors? As a Chinese Canadian myself am I not supposed to identify simply as Canadian?Heres something I posted a while ago in rasianamerican on this issuegt...assimilation doesnt necessarily mean giving up your ancestral roots. The concept of culture and society themselves are far too broad for us to see them as binaries between regions. The American melting pot concept is often viewed negatively but I think its a great description for this reason different metals that are melted down and formed together may change their outward appearance but they dont lose their unique individual properties. Similarly while new immigrants adopt elements of American culture most of them dont let go of their traditional culture nor are they generally asked to do so by others. They are accepted as fully American the moment they obtain citizenship for the most part at least in public. Id say that counts as assimilation.Unfortunately many people still conflate culture and race and view white as being the norm and thats where we have a problem.,toronto,ch3oum8,4,t5_2qi63

Horses shit about  times a day most of those will be in their stable each defecation weighs about .lbs and covers about a meter square.If they shit twice during patrol thats lbs of poop per patrol pair per day covering about  square meters.Conversely there are as many as  dogs in Toronto who shit about twice a day each defecation weighs about .lbs covering about a square foot .m.Thats about lbs of shit covering m every dayBy comparison to manure dog waste can take up to a year to break down fully and is FILLED with harmful bacteria and other pathogens which are toxic to humans  we do not force people to pick up dog shit because someone may step in it we force them to pick it up because its a public health hazard. So in conclusion lbs of toxic harmful long lasting shit covering  m VS lbs of harmless short lived shit covering mYour complaint is wrong it is specious and ignorant it is an opinion based on an emotional response you find horse manure icky and not an observation based on fact.And anyways if you want the manure removed simply call  the Toronto Police Service will come and remove it for you.,toronto,chzxnlk,1,t5_2qi63

That the Conservatives manage to pick up a larger percentage of voters when fewer people voted.That said EKOS Researchs most recent data says that the Liberals not the Conservatives pick up more vote while the NDP lose out.Now I dont have time to go through all the older poll results but it seems to be in following the election that when likely voters are considered its generally been the PC party that has gained more than the Liberals.

1313298,0,t3_291v3g,Sorry to interrupt the antiHorwath circle jerk but the ONDPs proportion of the popular vote actually increased one percentage point compared to the last election. As did the OLPs support. So the evidence suggests that Horwaths electoral strategy was not a total failure it attracted tens of thousands more voters. Granted an alternative electoral strategy might have attracted more voters but that is mere speculation. The difference of course is that the OLPs support was more geographically concentrated so given the irrationality of our electoral system the OLPs increase in popular support translated into  more seats whereas the ONDPs equivalent increase in popular support translated into none.Moreover as another poster already said nobody predicted that the OLP would win a majority so anybody in Horwaths shoes would have had every reason to believe that the ONDP would remain the power broker. On sheer principle I supported Horwaths decision to bring down the government no matter how much of our own money they proposed to throw at us. The Liberals lost all legitimacy when they decided to spend  billion to save two of their seats and then tried to cover it up.  Finally you should do some research before towing the media line that  Horwath veered the party to the right. Yes the ONDP opposed tax increases for transit and supported targeted tax cuts. Yes they opposed the ORPP whether that was a truly progressive proposal is another question. But if you compare the totality of their platform in this election to their platforms in years past there is not much difference in principle. And despite the exceptions just mentioned their platform was largely similar to the OLPs. They proposed increased funding for transit schools social assistance and healthcare. They also proposed raising the minimum wage expanding dental benefits for lowincome children and something the Liberals certainly didnt propose freezing postsecondary tuition and eliminating interest on student loans. That all sounds rather progressive by my books. Whether these proposals were overshadowed by the partys campaigning strategy or whether they just didnt fit the media narrative is up for debate. tldr Horwaths decision to force an election was not irrational given the circumstances she actually increased the ONDPS proportion of the popular vote and their platform was all the things considered rather progressive. ,toronto,cihd2o4,-1,t5_2qi63

I say that because at the end of the day he is a voice of a section of people in Toronto there are people who support him and agree with his message. On the flip site as pointed out by KPER Ford or other hypothetical candidates can use this as a means to skew their image to make them seem like they are the underdog of the people.If a politician gets out of hand at a debate its up the person forgive me I do not know the proper title running the debate to properly corral the offending parties.  Hes a mayoral candidate hes in the running he deserves a voice as does any of the other candidates.  Ignoringexcluding Ford is not the answer.  Whether or not hes fit for the job people need to start taking this guy more seriously constantly calling him a buffoon a drunk even though he can be those things will just lead to people underestimating him.

1515530,0,t3_2bgwpq,Theme Culture on Queen Street Stay on one street the entire time construction permitting Queen street east to west or Beaches to QueenwestSun up the RC Harris water treatment plant makes for a great walk to watch the sun come up by the beach.Breakfast Being a veggie I cant vouch for most the food. Nevertheless from the feedback I receive there are two prime locations in the beach. If you are looking for healthier Vivetha is the better option right beside RC Harris. If you arent watching your diet then you wont be disappointed in the lumberjack hangovercure from The Sunset Grill a little further down the street. Expect a line up for both of these places. If you arent into that just go to the Beacher. This is a landmark in the neighborhood and a nice place to enjoy brunch on the patio.Walk along Queen browsing shops until you work up another appetite. Even cheat and head down to the boardwalk to see the iconic Luetey lifeguard station. Once your stomach starts to grumble its time for sushi. Ive always called it the Sushi hut because of the pizza hut across the street but I believe bikkuri is the name. Japango is another option but its a bit more fancy if you know what I mean. if you dont dig sushi then you could the stuff to for a picnic from the IGA. Then chill and eat youre food in the in Qew gardens across the street. Theres a hero burger close by but for a real burger the priest is the bees knees. Someone else in this tread mentioned it and I support it. Dont go to the Hero no matter how tempting theres a really nice park near the Priest too.The movie theater is right across the street too if you want to kill time and thats your thing. You could see a movie anywhere though. I might recommend breaking the Queen street only rule here and walking to the end of the boardwalk or as far as you can get for a great view. After walking you deserve a pint. Murphys law is a little Irish pub on the corner of Queen st e and kingston road with a beautiful rooftop patio. Havent ordered anything other than their poutine. You might want to hang around there for dinner just to enjoy the atmosphere. In case you feel like really eating read on...Staying on Queen take the streetcar to the other side of town. This Streetcar ride takes you on a threedollar tour of torontonians lives. Exiting the beach you get into the trendy leslieville area with various antique shops and cafes. Lots of niche stores that might not peak everyones fancy but cant hurt to look around in. On this route also features some less attractive sides of Toronto dont stare at anyone in between Parliament and Sherbourne. A little gem called alfies is the culprit for most of this. DONT GET OFF HERE. Keep going and youll pass a lot more civilized places to stop. Even before you hit Younge you could break off and explore around church and queen. Without leaving Queen Henrys and downtown camera are both excellent photography stores closed on Sunday. The Eaton Centre is always open and has everything you might need. Id save my shopping for Queen west and the more local suppliers as long as everything isnt closed by the time you get there pm for most.Dinner Get off around Mccaul St. If youre really hungry just go to the Korean Grill cooking your own food is fasteasy they are good with first timers too. Theres a few Indian places but if you can get past the incense aroma then Little India if the best by far. Not that hungry? Try a crepe. Caf Crepe is a cool little place for a desert or savory snack. Drinks Now that were in the west end Im going to say start at the Black Bull or horseshoe Tavern. Being in the middle of everything these places probably get busy after dark. If you were looking for something with more locals Id venture up past Spadina Ave. The Cameron House is an old theater style building that has live shows all the time. Just check their website for listings. Be warned this is a hipster zone so its an acquired taste. Mostly just mellow and jazzy stuff too. If you are looking to turn UP Richmond is one block north. Take youre pick gravity is a popular one the weirder the name the better the drugs I mean drinks.What I could find for informationExpensive    Meh          Economical  Vivetha breakfastbrunch Sunset Grill breakfastbrunch The Beacher Caf breakfastbrunch burger priest lunchdinner Dirt Cheap Harveys fast food Japango lunchdinner bikkuri lunchdinner Murphys Law Bardinner little india dinner The Korean Grill house dinnerlunch Caf Crepe snacklunch Black Bull Tavern bar The horseshoe bar The Cameron barlive music  Beaches Cinema Queen East Imax Cinema Queen West Gravity night club Hotels,toronto,cj68y8w,1,t5_2qi63

Several other people Ive encountered have had the same problem.  In my case in the end after months of trying to contact them and having to get smallscale media involvement they simply picked the smaller of the two numbers and said ok thats your balance now.  It took months for them to do that much.  Presto and GO management function largely as unaccountable black boxes.  They should be running this system like its a bank because thats what it is essentially! but theyre not.I strongly advise you to not use their online system at all delays and money just disappears without recourse and to not keep more than  on your card at a time.

1578720,0,t1_cjdmcqs,First of all thank you for your service to our city our country amp our community. The police take a lot of flak in this city and its seldom deserved. Second thank you for taking the time to create this thread amp answer questions. AFAIK Reddit is new territory for TPS and you can never have enough communication with the public so its great to see you taking the initiative. Third great post People are very quick to accuse TPS of not caring about stolen bikes and not doing enough to find amp reunite them with their owners. But the fact of the matter is bicycle theft is a massive phenomenon that will always exist as long as there are bikes and there is actually very little that the police can do to combat it unless the public is cooperative and proactive which they are often not. If you dont register your bike and take other measures to protect it then you waive your right to complain if its stolen. Unregistered bikes are extremely difficult to trace so if it is recovered there isnt any concrete method of locating its rightful owner. Hopefully threads like this one will help get the message out about this issue amp others so that we can foster more cooperation between the public amp law enforcement. Ill offer these links up for those who are interested I check them daily. P.S. Stay safe. ,toronto,cje65mp,1,t5_2qi63

In response I think as cycling infrastructure becomes less adhoc in nature and continues to mature into a full and robust component of transportation infrastructure in general...that we will see something akin to sticker style registration as a means to generate extra revenue. As strictly a cyclist and mass transit user no drivers license it makes sense to me and I would happily embrace it if it could be directed towards building more fully separated lanes and the like.... Im also the kind of rider who stops at every stop sign uses hand signals wears a helmet religiously...not to be selfrighteous or set an example...more out of paranoia and to increase however illusory my sense of safety.

Explain why lost job no money moved back home... i.e. pull their heart strings a bit and be clear that you have no job and no money. This will discourage them from trying to collect. Dont even mention trying to pay them anything. If youre talking to them and they ask about payment explain again the no job and no money situation and apologize. Be polite and try keep the tone professional. Theyll have seen this sort of thing before its not unusual.If Judge Judy has taught me anything its that a landlord has a duty to minimize their losses. This means they have to try to rent your place. They cant just leave it empty and try and get you for the rest of the lease.By informing them as soon as possible that you will be breaking your lease it gives them the most time to find a new tenant. In the Toronto market this might take a month might take two.Hopefully you did a good job cleaning the place when you moved out.

Its not going to drive them out of business like the rBitcoiners think but it is competition in ecommerce and might force the banks to lower their insane conversion and transaction fees.Governments mainly just want to make sure you pay your taxes. In the case of China they have a pretty heavily controlled market and people were using Bitcoin to try and circumvent that. So it had to go there.gt I guess itd be cool if a few bars amp shops would let me pay in junior mining or unknown small cap tech stocks but it wouldnt make them any less risky... nor would having an ATM for them.Thing is its not high risk for merchants in the slightest and more and more are accepting it for a reason. Its actually very low risk as long as you sell immediately or pay someone to manage the Bitcoin end of the business. The risk comes when you hold it like a buffoon saying to the moon.

Unfortunately you may remember grammar rules but you forget vocabulary quickly and become quite useless without regular practice with French speakers. I actually wanted to move to Montreal for a while just to cement the language in my head I still want to do that before I get too old but becoming fluent in French while living in Toronto is going to be hard unless you specifically seek out Frenchlanguage clubs or groups or other things online where you can talk to a native French speaker and you help each other learn your respective languages.,toronto,cjssg72,5,t5_2qi63

Though we make the belts and such the big money is made in equestrian equipment. As of last year we have  of the global market single largest share. The other big money comes from shoes. Next time you see a pair of leather shoes at ALDO look at the label if it says Made in India it came from our factory. If it says Made in Turkey then we supplied the leather but the shoe was assembled in Turkey.We are in this category. Its a capital intensive low margin business due to wastage flaws and fashion changes so there is also a streak of simplicity my dad and grand dad are big Buffett fans I stay in rented apartments not condos and am currently trying to justify an iPod touch to myselfEDIT Just to clarify it was my effort to internationalize the business that added the riding equipment and ALDO so its not like I just got this handed down.,toronto,cjt7htu,3,t5_2qi63

1700244,0,t1_cjsxjdv,gt Then there is how women are treated.This good sirmadam is proof you are speaking from generalized misconceptions and falsehoods. Women are treated phenomenally here its not like neighbouring countries at all.  This was recently recognized by a report from Harvard which ranked UAE first in the world for treatment of women.  Not only is their a cultural practice of giving women first access to services and complete respect but because like anywhere men are opting out of school women are taking on positions of management and directorship due to being better qualified. Because international competition is so important here agencies are hiring women with no prejudice. Like many places flash forward a generation and women will be in greater positions of government and business authority than men and this applies to many industries like public sector research general management accounting and much more.TLDR UAE is NOT like its neighbours you are being informed by prejudice.gt You seem to have a love of money  I work in government nonprofits and development in general so no I do not have a love for money.  You are a visceral troll and I should not be feeding you.Also on women being covered if you intend to go there only Emirati women are covered and by choice and so are men. Where women have to wear black men have to wear white but this makes up only  of the population where the rest wear what ever they want.And as for slavery yes wages were a problem in the early days and it was the practice of businesses not government to hold visas but over the last  years that has been made very illegal and businesses lose their license to practice all the time if they play games with their labourers.  BTW it is actually hardly different in practice from Canadas Temporary Foreign Workers whereas at least UAE is clamping down on it while Canada is still getting its feet wet.Edit You need to travel more sirmadam before you lambast places that you have no idea what you are talking about.,toronto,cjth8cz,1,t5_2qi63

1769569,0,t3_2enm8r,Hi. Im Dan Simon one of the two official tenant representatives for  Yonge Street as well as two other apartment buildings under the same landlords control Ms. Bianca Pollak. The other representative Andrew Gallagher doesnt even have a Reddit account. I was notified of this post today and I want to clarify a few things.. I dont know who the poster is. YongeStreet does not speak for all of the tenants and by posting under the username of the address may give that impression. I would encourage YongeStreet to get in contact with me if they are a tenant they have my phone email and know where I live. I would appreciate a conversation about this. . YongeStreet does not have all of the information nor is aware of much of what has gone on on the tenants behalf because of the hard work of myself Andrew and another tenant. We have handled most of the coordination with city and provincial officials but only provide updates when we have news worthy of sharing. . Councillor Jaye Robinson has been one of our strongest allies throughout  from the moment of the evacuation onwards. She was on scene that day and spent several days trying to work with our landlord to bring that crisis to a speedy resolution. However as all of the tenants know trying to get our landlord to do anything is impossible.Since then Jaye has marshalled everything the city can do in this situation that is within her power. She coordinated meetings for tenants with city staff and the LTB investigations unit to help us get better informed on our rights and the processes we needed to go through. She has put two staff Emma Best and Mike Varey at our disposal and they have been keeping us updated frequently with everything theyve been doing on our behalf. She has even moved mountains in her schedule to come to our local Starbucks and have sit downs with us about our situation just to hear our grievances.She has kept the Municipal Licensing and Standards Department continually checking in and fining our landlord for infractions. She and her staff ensured fire inspections were carried out and followed up on. She or a staff member usually Emma were at every single one of the Landlord Tenant Board Hearings. Her staff has helped us navigate FOI requests getting past red tape and filing paperwork to provide us with witnesses at the LTB. They have been keeping in touch and sending us notes of encouragement and sympathy at every turn.I say this as someone who automatically distrusts politicians Jaye Robinson has done everything in her power to help us and has gone above and beyond on several occasions. What the OP is forgetting is that our situation doesnt fall under the citys jurisdiction and city councillors only have so much influence over these proceedings. Rental law and Renters rights are governed by the Landlord Tenant Board a provincial body. The laws are written and managed by the Office of Municipal Affairs another provincial office. The city has some control over the developments that come in and helps negotiate above and beyond the provincial minimums for demoltion evictions and can enforce property standards fire codes and the likes. There isnt much more Jaye could do for us and yet she still continues to open roads of communication with other city officials and has been encouraging and helpful as we take this to the provincial level. But the reality is theres no magic wand in any of the several city departments or provincial bodies toolkits to solve our issues quickly.Lastly the OP has every right to be frustrated as our situation as tenants is deplorable. But I would encourage them not to personally trash people who are working on our behalf.,toronto,ck27kdd,1,t5_2qi63

That mentality is a few hundred years too late.Thanks for actually being a human being. I am sorry that some of the rest of the antiFord crowd doesnt see that Rob is a human being as well some of these pseudoliberal fascists would wish death upon anyone who doesnt share their worldview. Some of these people claim to be liberal but support the harshest punishments against anyone who disagrees with their particular vision of the future contradicting their own democratic principles by only wanting freedom and liberty for those who are exactly like themselves.  In their defence maybe they cant relate because theyve never experienced a loss of a loved one before or maybe they have a  very flimsy moral compass but thats for them to figure out. I support Rob Ford politically in this election but whether we agree or disagree on political opinions at the end of the day we are human beings and we need to unite against common problems like disease rather than fight about our differences or rejoice when someone different than us becomes sick.  We are all human and we will all one day have to face things like cancer and disease. When the death to ford camp one day has to face their own problems with cancer illness and death I hope they never have to realize how horrible it is for people to be happy that you are dying. I remember watching the Qaddafi video where his dyingdead body is being dragged in the streets and beat up and despite the awful crimes against humanity he committed I must admit that as a human being I felt sorry for him. I sympathized with him being humiliated for no other reason than empathy. For no reason other than that he was a human being like me who feels pain.

I have been on many a  when she is on it and started a scene causing the packed bus to go out of service. Everything from a person accidentally grazing her wheelchair while walking by to people putting bags on that flat space at the front of the bus. A driver even told her its fine people put their bags there because they are out of the way there but she freaked out because it obstructed her view. Often she will cause a scene getting off the bus too. If youre not  feet away from the doorway while she is trying to get off she is going to scream at you about giving her room even though you have given her more than enough room. Ive even heard tell of drivers who have had past incidents with her and now refuse to pick her up if they see her waiting.One time I was sitting in one of the single seats minding my own business headphones on texting my boyfriend about what we should do for dinner and she started a scene with another passenger who knows what about. I didnt pay much attention glanced up to see what was going on and continued texting. Well she saw me with my phone in my hand and apparently I was holding it in her direction so she started screaming at me telling me to stop taking her picture I do not have permission to do that! I calmly said Im not taking your picture Im just texting my boyfriend. She kept yelling at me so I said fine look through my pictures if you want there is no picture of you I dont want a picture of you. She said she didnt have to look through them she knows there is a picture of her. I again said no I didnt take your picture and this is the last time I will speak to her about it. She kept yelling at me I just sat there listening to my music continuing my text conversation pretending like she wasnt there. Since I wasnt responding she kept yelling so the driver told her that if she doesnt stop causing a scene he will kick her off the bus. She told him I took her pictures and he said he heard exactly what happened and if i am willing to show proof I didnt take her picture then i clearly didnt take her picture and if she continues this he will kick her off the bus.

Not sure what his take was on the incident  dont have the time to research enough to track him down at the moment  but Im fairly sure that if nothing at all happened then the guy wouldnt have had a reason to record in the first place and he would likely be speaking out against her if she had just made it up.  I think they had his twitter handle listed.  Reddit do what you do best.

He was told that it could be another seven years and he was saying by that time he will be dead.

When  of your operating revenue is coming from grants theyll spend most of their time writing those grant applications which have specific asks for specific programs.

2120072,0,t1_cl98o86,This whole chains started off because you were slamming someone else. No one is slamming you  only arguing with you over your points. If any of us have been slamming you then anything you wrote can also be considered slamming. I will point out that I became more curt with my arguments after you became less nuanced with accusations of people being ignorant naive or immature. Ironically i applied the same arguments back to you in the form you wrote them and then YOU became offended by the tone they took the same tone you write to people i will point out. Perhaps this is why OP told you to cool your jets right off the bat.It is a matter of public record that my reading comprehension is fine. What isnt fine is the way you are handling people with differing opinions. I wont tell you to work on it however as that is your business. But i will take this  out as long as you want if need be until you are satisfied. So i will summarize line by line a retort to your following summarySure maybe she can handle it just like some people can handle other very risky things.  AgreedBut most people cant. I disagreeMost people dont make big moves like that in the first place and those that do will usually acknowledge that it comes with heavy costs  costs that sometimes never be recouped. costs come for everything  even staying at home. you can go nowhere fast working a job in the USA with all the stability in the world. Risks come alongside investment  any kind of investment be it personal financial or physical and the greater the risk the greater the potential for gain but also costEssentially all Im saying is What if the OPs girlfriend cant handle it if things dont work out?  If theyre not yet serious enough for marriage are they really serious enough to warrant her making this move? My main point is that there exists an INTERMEDIATE stage between serious and marriage which OP explain is where they are at which is what this disagreement has been about the whole time which many people believe in prior to marrying and have decided is important to explore before marrying. Because if things go south then in addition to all the crap she has to deal with resolving with a breakup there is added complication and cost BECAUSE of the marriage licence and legality and the social implicationsunwarranted taboo of divorce that wouldnt be there otherwise.,toronto,cl9b2mj,2,t5_2qi63

All Canadian citizens should have a grasp of one of the two official languages but that doesnt mean we have to ignore the fact that many dont. I would rather we employ simple solutions to the actual language barriers faced by Torontonians then ignore them because they ought to know English. For instance I live in little Italy and I know many of the older generation dont have a fluent grasp on English I also know that many of the younger generation have a fluent grasp on both English and Italian if you sought out volunteers who spoke both English and Italian you would alleviate the barrier while simultaneously making the election run more smoothly.

2223133,0,t3_2kl8tv,Hey there. Asking questions is a great first step. Let me try to help point you in the right direction...First if youre ever fearful that youre going to hurt yourself please reach out right away. You can go to an emergency room andor call an emergency hotline like Kids Help Phone. In fact you can call Kids Help Phone even at any time even if youre not at your lowest or your issue seems minor to talk through stuff with a counsellor.Second there was another young woman around your age who asked about this here this year. Her original post is here and she wrote a follow up here People gave her lots of support and suggestions so those will be good resources for you too.Third if your friends parents have genuinely offered to take you in speak to them honestly and see if you can find an arrangement where everyone will be comfortable. The more people you can rely on and be safe with and who care about you the better. Maybe you would be more comfortable staying with them if once you have a job you pay them a little bit of rent? Or you can offer to help out around the house to show your appreciation?Finally at your age you are very likely entitled to seek out your own medical care and to receive it confidentially. If you already like and have a good relationship with your doctor you could reach our to ask if he or she would treat you without telling your parents.Good luck. And feel free to ask back here for more advice any time you need it too.,toronto,clmew4k,4,t5_2qi63

2238452,0,t1_cloay6j,gt He stated it was just BDSM and a jilted exgirlfriend where is his proof of this.  Yes he should at least name some names although maybe its a case of seeing how vitriolic some people are getting in terms of condemning him outright as a sexual deviant and a rapist. I would say that he should publically identify the people hes talking about especially if it can lead to a name and shame situation of one of the women making the allegations of sexual and physical abuse.gt These are the allegations that Jian made that he has to back up and he hasnt youre giving him the benefit of the doubt on those statements.Its not that as it is doing what everyone else on this progressive shithole of a subreddit isnt doing and talking about the problems in believing inherently in the allegationsaccusations of women who overwhelmingly havent even come into the public eye.Their allegations are far more serious as well and to that extent require a lot more in the way of scrutiny then theyre getting at the current time. gt Im not stating that youre a PR shill I just think youre putting a greater burden on the women than on Jian for their actions.Again far more serious allegations really do require a far greater burden of proof. I dont see how thats such a hard thing to process without leaping into the its misogyny bullshit dogpile.gt What Im saying is that we need to treat this as a serious situation and consider all the people in it before we immediately jump to a conclusion of rapeabuse or not. Youre in the wrong fucking sub for that my friend. This is only good as a showpiece to prove how goddamn stupid progressives are when it comes to things like this.gt  We must treat EVERYONE the same here and take EVERYONEs statement as true in the absence of hard evidence.No because theyre not the same. Whatever you want to say about Ghomeshi he hasnt alleged anything like these women have and hes in the public eye as it is. These women didnt go to the police because they didnt have proofdidnt want their narrative questioned and thats why the vast majority of them havent even gone public.Its not the same as claiming theyre lying plain and simple to say that the burden of proof is overwhelmingly on them for their allegations.gt This is true but you cant immediately dismiss their statements as you havent immediately dismissed Jians.I havent dismissed their statements outright. Im just decidedly sceptical especially about the ones still in anonymity.gt  Neither is supporting their statements with any hard evidence that we as the general public can see. Therefore both statements must be considered equally.If Ghomeshi alleged that these women came to his house and tried to steal from him or stab him or something serious then the burden of proof would equally be on him to show that that happened in some way. gt Here you are demanding the women provide proof of their allegations without demanding that Jian provide proof of his.Because their allegations are far more serious then anything hes said about the issue. The two are not equal.gt We have to be receptive to potential abuse victims because they could have been through a very bad situation and we should help them through it.You can be supportive in the sense of not accusing them of making stuff up outright but they shouldnt be exempt from proceedings thatre normal when any other kind of crime is alleged to have been committed.gt On the flip side a false accusation can ruin a persons lifecareer and the defense must take an equal side.Which is what this subreddit and progressives in general are already very enthusiastic about seeing happen.gt I get your point on wanting their to be more evidence and innocent until proven guilty but with abuse victims that is a careful line to cross because it becomes easy to frighten abuse victims away from telling their stories if they arent going to be given any sort of weight.Im not that sympathetic. If engaging in the regular way is enough to frighten them off because they want special treatmentto be coddled by the police and the courts for whatever reason then all it does is provide reasons to be suspicious of their claims in the first place.,toronto,clod02a,1,t5_2qi63

2324683,0,t1_clz11af,yup sounds about right.  trains in  minutes results in a frequency of  seconds or roughly  minutes and  seconds. Actual capacity will be less than  however as that is a crush load number and not really representative of how many people can actually fit into the train on a typical rush hour. Frequencies can be higher however up to around  times an hour essentially negating this smaller capacity.your theoretical bus would run into many issues such as boarding times that would make its practical capacity very low.Sheppard LRT has a stop spacing averaging roughly  meters  stations in km not  that you suggest.The LRT will run at roughly kmh on the surface from what I can remember and the last kilometre will be underground as well meaning roughly kmh on that last km. Trip time on the Sheppard LRT should be made end to end in around  minutes give or take a minute or two due to not completely reliable stoplight timing. This will be an improvement of roughly  minutes over current travel time on the existing bus according to google maps.  Now of course very few riders will be doing this trip many will be getting off at McCowan to catch the Scarborough subway.But I wasnt discussing speed only capacity of different modes which a streetcar line most certainly doesnt reach  pphd or whatever was being claimed it is typically closer to th of that.existing streetcars with streetcar lanes have capacity maybe  more all the lane does is provide more reliable transport times and reliability improving actual capacity and service quality. capacity is really more the limiting factor of train size.,toronto,clz1m87,1,t5_2qi63

Camera dept is probably the hardest to break into because every kid with a DSLR fancies themselves a DOP these days I have friends in their midtwenties who are still living at home shooting every probono project they can in order to build their reel. It really is ridiculously competitive.I work primarily as a freelancer in art department with the occasional camera assistant or grip amp electric gig to fill in the gaps. There is no shortage of work if youre willing to jump between departments to make rent. August was so busy I was literally turning down two jobs a day and everyone I could think of referring was completely booked as well. Commercial gigs are competitive well save for art department we get hosed with union rate and the work tends to be a lot more steady. The other perk to working art or productions department is you almost always have a rental vehicle at your disposal with gas parking and insurance covered by the production company. Usually its a cube truck or a Dodge Caravan but it sure beats freezing your nads off in mid january waiting for the night bus to make your am call.

Under Islam every woman is a secondclass citizen. She can inherit only half as much as her brother. Her testimony in courtsay in the case of her own rapeis worth half that of her rapist. A Muslim woman has to ask a male guardian for permission to get married or have a childin some places to even leave the house. And all these various oppressions are justified using the core texts of Islam the Koran and the hadith. Im amazed by the accusation that something Ive said on this topic is controversial.

2485125,0,t3_2o1jzo,So heres what happened.This is not Enbridge or the government out to screw you. Your volumetric gas rate m rate for the gas only actually increased last March if you go back and look at your bills or go on the OEB website. Why? Because of the cold winter we had last year.Since Enbridge is a regulated entity regulated by the Ontario Energy Board they are allowed to recover their costslosses on gas supply from consumers. If we all remember last winter it was quite cold. Why does that matter? Well it meant that wholesalemarket gas prices soared the highest since . While Enbridge does help customers with this by hedging part of their foretasted they must buy the remainder on the wholesale market which consumption spikes. When its cold you burn more which makes your gas consumption go up which makes market prices go up. Given that the short term cost increase is borne by Enbridge they charge you for that increase ex post until theyve recovered the loss from supplying you gas at below market prices last winter. Enbridge and Union gas are only allowed to change their retail rates on a quarterly basis hence the ex post adjustment which makes your rates slow to adjust to these wholesale market spikes. Once the costloss on that gas has been recovered by Enbridge there should be a downward adjustment yes those actually happen.So thats how it works. I dont and have never worked for Enbridge but I do work in the industry.,toronto,cmixzzk,24,t5_2qi63

But can it create a street with some walkability? Its possible and has happened in other cities.Im much more skeptical on this point. I think youre going to see similar results as on Sheppard where increases in local density along the corridor didnt result in any kind of placemaking. Keesmat would almost definitely respond that the design approach on the Avenues will be more urbanistic and pedestrian friendly but I think this downplays the difficulties of trying to build isolated dense clumps STC or fingers the avenues amidst low density commercial and industrial landuse patterns. Not trying to be overly critical. I just wish that the City would think about urbanism and density in a broader context than narrow arbitrary corridors and growth centres. These houses are literally a two minute walk from a future ECLRT station. The area could be easily and cheaply densified by building denser townhomes.

2604711,0,t1_cmyd8sw,Explain? Sure. He was charged with two counts of first degree murder. The Crown put forth a case to the best of their abilities to prove those charges. The defense blamed it on PTSD which in my opinion albeit one with limited knowledge on PTSD was a sham to claim NCR. The guy was walking around with a gun. He wasnt going to use it to shoot holes in the ground to plant petunia seeds. He wanted to put bullets in the heads and chests of those who he felt wronged him or maybe he really wanted their shoes. Maybe he didnt or maybe he did plan to kill those people at the Eaton Centre that day. But one thing I do believe is that he probably wanted to kill them at some point.I care deeply for people with mental illness it runs in my family but what I dont want to see not as a legal geek but as a regular member of society is people using mental illness left right and centre to get out of first degree murder cases. Although it does have its place and I had a former close friend recently acquitted of seconddegree murder of his sister because of mental illness I hope NCR is applied correctly and not just as a kneejerk reaction of defence attorneys to excuse murder.But thats just my take.

Now the schools dont have to pay for tokens for all the students which means more school funds.I knew a girl in elementary school she lived JUST outside the bus route or something like that and she wasnt aloud to take the bus. She lived right beside a busy road too basically she lived in the complete opposite direction of the school and theres no bus stops over there. Her mom had to take her to a babysitter in the morning until she was in grade  or  so she had a safer way to walk to school. Thats pretty embarassing. If oshawa had a proper bus system she couldve took transit to school. fortunately her mom let her walk to high school lol.  That happens to alot of kids my ex had to walk  mins mins home every day unless he had money for the bus because he also lived JUST outside the bus route. School busses dont help everyone. And this IS helping them pay for transit. they dont have to pay for their children to get on thats saving them money so they have to pay  cents more for themselves...these still saving money by not paying for their children.

Think of that a private company running it makes m profit what would it cost us if this was public?Issues with a public toll highway.  When the cost to maintain goes up the logical solution is to pass on those costs to the users.  Users as we all know hate paying theyd all rather other people to pay.  A private company will simply jack up the fees and this allows the politicians to be shielded from backlash.  If this was public the user fees on the  would be much lower and it would not make any money and would probably cost all of us money even those who never use it.  Other Take aways.  The  has to pay the OPP to patrol it and they pay for their own snow removal.If that were a public highway the OPP would be paid by the province and the snow removal as well.  In short it would make far less than m in profit.And a big chunk of that profit does back to us in our CPP and another chunk goes to the tax man.There is a logical reason why the  operations were sourced out and it wasnt simply the short term revenue.  The long term costs of running a major highway are a lot higher than most think.  Probably explains why most of our public infrastructure is shit because the politicians dont want to add the required fees to fix it.  So it crumbles.,toronto,co7rbrn,2,t5_2qi63

3059529,0,t3_2v78ck,Ive started to think about it like this. Toronto has increased significantly in population over recent years. Often the first thing a person faces when moving to a big city is a loss of identity. Its difficult to feel that you stand out are special or matter when tossed into a crowd of . million others. For many its not easy to accept that they arent the shining stars or special snowflakes we were assured we were while growing up. Instead of going out there and doing something special its much easier to sit on here and bash others based on opinion or false knowledge. All the while the key to living in a big city is to understand the art of negotiation and compromise. Two things that arent stressed enough these days. Current culture promotes division and side taking on issues and rtoronto is not immune to something thats actually quite pervasive.In the era of Google so many feel they are geniuses and experts on every issue. And once a position is struck on an issue its near impossible for people these days to admit fault.This isnt just rtoronto. If you think this is bad try rcanada or rworldnews. Youll be hilariously treated to experts on the UkraineRussia conflict who have never lived let alone set foot in either of these countries.I like rToronto and think there is a great opportunity to take in other perspectives. Its not easy to pry yourself away from any given current belief but it is nice to have people who make you think Oh! Thats interesting. I never really thought about it like that.As with anything the real losers are those with complete inflexibility and inability to understand that others matter. Ive probably had moments of inflexibility on here. Im sure we all do. But its something to be mindful about.Edit  Added a missing quotation mark,toronto,cof48i3,7,t5_2qi63

They are much lower than comparable municipalities and a year increase per average household would sustain service levels.But why should property owners be the ONLY people that pay for the citys services? It doesnt make sense in a time when many residents of the city dont own property.So then council needs to look at other more balanced means of generating revenues. Road tolls parking fees or new forms of tax like a sales tax are all options.Arguing against this or that revenue tool isnt helpful.

3341078,0,t1_cp9093a,The simple fact is that if a police officer wants to ticket you theyll find something to ticket you for.  This happened to me a few years ago.  I was at an intersection waiting to turn left so I could then move into the right lane and enter a plaza to pick up my mom.  As I made the left turn on a priority green a police cruiser made a right turn from the opposite direction so as to follow me.  She was obviously trying to catch me making a wide left turn so she could ticket me.Unfortunately for her I made the turn completely by the numbers  signal left enter left lane signal right enter right lane cancel and restart right signal enter plaza.  She followed me into the plaza anyways.  I stopped at a legal stopping spot to wait for my mom to bring the groceries over but the cop car was right on my tail.  I could almost hear the gears turning in her head as she tried to figure out what she could get me for.  Finally she lit me up walked over and handed me a ticket...  for having rear red turn signals.  Which came stock with my car.  Which half the cars on the road have.Ultimately I had the light colours changed to amber took the repair invoice to court and had the ticket thrown out.  On principle though rear red turn signals are not illegal the section of the law quoted was intended to prevent impersonations of fire trucks and I should just have fought the ticket out of principle alone.,toronto,cp93vll,2,t5_2qi63

3346950,0,t1_cp9k50r,There is a spectrum of abuse.  A bright malefemale breakdown hides some of the nuances and intersections that occur.  The impact of abuse on women is greater  emotionally physically socially and economically by several orders of magnitude.  We only have so many resources and the prioritisation or resources isVictim impacted in a small way by abuse lt victim impacted in a major way by abuseMore men are in the first group more women are in the second.  A man in the second group would get resources before a woman in the first group but since there are less of them and their resource needs are different to the majority of abused women the help they receive is not captured by tradional statistics.  In the specific issue mentioned in the billboard women often do not have control of their money financial abuse and need to leave their homes to seek physical safety. Hence they need shelters.  Men leaving abusive relationships are statistically able to afford moving out andor not in physical danger so they can wait to physically seperate. Mothers are in increased danger of severe physical abuse fathers are actually less likely to be abused than nonparents so again there is a need to provide a safe shelter for people that have economic disadvantages on parental leavenot workingunable to find or afford child are. Statistically when women break up a relationship is the most dangerous time  the rate of severe physical abusemurder shoots up.  That simply does not happen with men.  The shelters provide a police protected place to hide to avoid being killed that most abused men do not need.,toronto,cp9s0fg,6,t5_2qi63

3454400,0,t1_cpl4vri,I agree completely with this comment. I have a degree in fashion design from ryerson and have worked in product development for over a decade. For design and product development you need the educational background. However classmates who became stylists knew the right people and made the right connections  they partied a lot went to bars met models actors other stylists people in film and tv etc.As for the business side of the industry its a decent career choice. The design industry in Toronto has hollowed out but there are still quite a few positions on the buying side or merchandising and marketing. For those areas you do need school although some retailers have a buyer trainee program where they allow sales staff to enrol and work their way up. I dont know much about the program at George brown but at ryerson we had to complete a work study program of our choice working in the industry. For some people that panned out into obtaining really good jobs and connections. Good luck ,toronto,cpm10js,3,t5_2qi63

But the fact that Sloan made it from Halifax is relevant because it undermines your otherwise solid point. Coming to Toronto after youve already made it  which they clearly had by Twice Removed  is something many people do as its just a hub for so many things.

And many of these people came back and have yet to partake in any discussion or cause affecting racialized peoples helping lowincome and impoverished families and individuals here volunteer etc. Instead I see a ritual Facebook update once a year with a picture them with a black child in their arms accompanied with the caption about how they cherish their moment of being in an impoverished village and being thankful they have a sink and not a water pump a mile down the road.Volontourism is an industry where people go to visit exotic areas with exotic people with exotic cultures like its a petting zoo for their ego.Also the same people who advocated for weeks that Canada find KONY. ,toronto,cpoufst,15,t5_2qi63

Thats the problem with two lanes of traffic running into a backed up one lane on ramp.Ive documented these intersections extensively because Im working with people in my building to come up with a plan for when the intersections get rebuilt which is scheduled to be in a few years time.Secondly even going by your estimates thats x hours of inconvenience  hours vs. the  you cite. Again thats not factoring in lost productivity during the day for all of those people  that is a really really conservative number.  stories x . units per floor directly facing the construction lower floors have more units let alone those further in the complex being affected by reflected noise  people in  King St. E.  people in  Lombard theres also a hotel and people in some of the lower rise buoldings affected too. By in large the impact on residents far exceeds the impact on drivers needless to say that residents I think should have an expectation of not necessarily quiet but at least not loud noise.Bear in mind this isnt emergency work. If it was I would have no problem with it. There is someone in Toronto Hydro or Entera Contracting who came up with a plan that in part read jack hammering and vacuum excavation in the middle of the night next to residences and this planner then said yeah thats a great idea!Bear also in mind that there is still work going on now so its not a matter of they could only do it at night or something like that.

Widening platforms would involve moving tracks and moving tracks would involve demolishing and relocating those columns which support the entire station. This would require closing massive sections of the station or the whole thing even for years which would cripple capacity for commuters in and out of the city. Not to mention the billions of dollars it would cost. The other option would be to close every other track and use this new space to join two existing platforms but that would effectively halve the train capacity of the station. With GO RER and its associated massive increase in train traffic being implemented over the next several years this is also not an option.So while its still a bad situation and this tragic incident is a clear indicator of that GO and the City have doneare doing all they can to improve the situation at Union. New stairways and concourses to get people off the platforms quicker and smaller electric trains running more frequently so that there arent waves of thousands of people boarding and alighting at each platform but rather hundreds over a more spread out time period.Long term solutions such as satellite stations near SpadinaCherry a new level of tracks under the existing level and reopening the midtown line that passes by the former North Toronto station now the Summerhill LCBO are also being looked at. ,toronto,cqu2d5s,7,t5_2qi63

We cant allow wild animals to eat our crops so we kill them all but the cows dont give a fuck about the small animals and a good fence is all thats needed to keep the wolves out. Instead of buying into whatever bullshit propaganda that is fed to you maybe you should do some actual research and more importantly go out and gain some real life experience. It doesnt matter what you eat something else had to die in order for you to continue living. Even plants feast on the dead. As for your unfounded claim that meat eaters wouldnt eat meat if we had to raise it kill it etc... you do realize if that were the case the majority of the human race would have turned vegetarian well before industrialization and the invention of the butcher shop right? The whole buying your meat ready to cook and eat thing is a relatively new trend as far as human history is concerned and it mainly exists only in first world countries not having to kill your own food was a luxury once reserved to the ruling elites and the insanely wealthy. Your claim although idealistic is rather naive it discounts the billions of people around the world who dont share our first world luxuries as well as all the people who work in the food industry world wide. ,toronto,cqxqpsk,0,t5_2qi63

Each shareholder in the legal entity is granted the right to occupy one housing unit. A primary advantage of the housing cooperative is the pooling of the members resources so that their buying power is leveraged thus lowering the cost per member in all the services and products associated with home ownership.gtAnother key element is that the members through their elected representatives screen and select who may live in the cooperative unlike any other form of home ownership.  Housing cooperatives fall into two general tenure categories nonownership referred to as nonequity or continuing and ownership referred to as equity or strata. In nonequity cooperatives occupancy rights are sometimes granted subject to an occupancy agreement which is similar to a lease In equity cooperatives occupancy rights are sometimes granted by way of the purchase agreements and legal instruments registered on the title. The corporations articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as occupancy agreement specifies the cooperatives rules.gtgtImage i  Housing cooperatives on Central Park West in Manhattan New York City from left to right The Majestic The Dakota The Langham and The San Remo.Interesting Student housing cooperative | Amalgamated Housing Cooperative | Clays Lane Estate | Student Housing Cooperative at Michigan State University Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqxyvb oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqxyvb.

3884169,0,t1_cqyv6kb,gt I think most people are underestimating the amount of opposition.There is quite a bit and for various reasons.  Some are concerned due to timing too early to introduce others see it as a parental preference to do it at home some object to social engineering some just have their head stuck in the sand others it is religious beliefs.  I think the latter are just louder than everyone else.About  of the kids in my school were not present.  No way to know how many were out for this vs. sick or whatever.I am a parent on a school council and also involved in cluster parent academy and none of us to my knowlege were approached to give any feedback or input into the curriculum and I am not sure I know anyone who was.  And honestly it doesnt surprise me.  When we go to planning meetings etc it is never to consult they are just telling us how it is going to be and in most cases they just see us as a pain in the ass.The government completely screwed up their communication.  The document is way too long and the details are buried.  A simple tldr at the beginning showing what grades they currently teach sex ed in and curriculum vs new plan would have made way too much sense. With each point they could then link to the specific page outlining goals etc.I support the sex ed program but also prefer to educate my children about sex at home. Kids are naturally curious and I take the approach that if they ask a question they deserve an answer and not try and hide the truth.   ,toronto,cqz11d7,2,t5_2qi63

And besides unless the dress code is semi formal every day shell have to adjust her wardrobe upon entering a job anyways!Just because the real world doesnt match what wed like it to be doesnt mean that we should abandon the principles it doesnt match. Rather we should strive to adjust the real world accordingly. Thats the essence of progress and its the same principle that applies here.A crop top is unprofessional only according to the conventions of professionalism that we agree to. These conventions are in turn malleable. It is conventional also whether or not a high school  and an arts school at that  is a professional environment. Clearly the principle and most of this sub thought one thing and the students thought another. Which makes sense since the dress code was rather vague and who knows what kind of setting an arts school really is?Lastly I want to point out that universities generally speaking do not have any such dress code. Wear a crop top in a  person lecture hall? No problem. I find it odd then that the argument concerning boys hormones immediately ceases to aplly after they leave grade . Have they magically matured? More likely theyve learned to control themselves  and likely through exposure to women wearing revealing clothes. Perhaps we should give these boys a bit more credit I dont think a belly button will drive them mad. It didnt for me in high school.In any case. I for one am happy they started a discussion like this. Theres no dictionary of social norms we can consult to decide these things they only take shape when we talk about them.

4107260,0,t3_37nq8l,Sigh. While its tough to pin down a correct valuation without going into detail the methodology as indicated in this article is extremely flawed. To do a valuation you use cashflows not net income. To convert that net income to cashflows the biggest change is adding back  of amortization  of financing charges  and subtracting  of capital expenditures. This puts your cashflow closer to  there are other items too but this is a simplification. Discounting the net income at a rate equal to government debt?! No. This is a corporation which is inherently much riskier. For sure utilities are one of the safest companies out there but you should discount them at their weighted average cost of capital. I cant figure that out easily offhand but equity risk implies it will be much higher than government debt! This can then be offset by the companys longterm growth rate. Investors require a discount to participate in IPOs. This is usually pegged at .While I really dont know what the valuation is this unfortunately is not a good analysis to undermine it.For more info on discounted cashflow For Hs financials ,toronto,crogbje,23,t5_2qi63

You generally do an EA in order to proceed with a specific construction undertaking. So yes making a decision on an EA to remove is putting the City on the path to removing that .km stretch of the Gardiner. A remove EA would not solicit input on maintaining the Gardiner. This decision sets the terms of reference for the EA study. It would limit the study to the scope of either Remove or Maintain. The EA would consult on the remove option and evaluate various remove alternatives. That said this being Toronto EAs mean dont mean much check out all the Transit City EAs but generally theyre the first stage in a specific pathway of activities. You dont do an EA to study removal if you intend to pursue the Maintain option and vice versa.Heres an old transpo related EA that might give people a sense of what to expect,toronto,crq9o2j,5,t5_2qi63

Although you can cross the main ship channel from Cherry Beach to the Island and be at Wards and its roughly  of a mile youll be on the wrong side of the islands. Its short hop but the south side of the islands is one long spit all the way to the Western Gap Billy Bishop Airport and Hanlans point. Beef is right that putting in at Cherry Beach is a quick way to the islands. youll have to both cross the Eastern Gap and traverse it. If you stay near the sea wall youll be out of the way of boat traffic and the gap is quite narrow so if you pick your moment you wont have a lot of traffic to contend with. This is the route that most canoeists and kayakers take. Its under a mile to the first lagoon between Algonquin and Wards islands. Youll also have to cross in front of the ferry dock at Wards but that shouldnt be too hard. From a reasonable place to put your canoe in the lake to Sunfish Cut is . miles.

4407339,0,t1_csm56yd,Never the less in Ontario according to Bill  Heritage Hunting and Fishing Act  Right to hunt and fish.    A person has a right to hunt and fish in accordance with the law.Hunting and fishing is a mega billion dollar industry in Ontario and that includes people in cities who go hunting while on vacation or weekends. In fact the vast majority of funding for things like wildlife conservation comes directly from hunters licensing fees thats how wildlife gets protected. Without hunting and licensing fees there would be no money to pay for officers to monitor for poaching.I live in downtown Toronto I used to live in a rough neighbourhood. The previous occupant of our apartment was a drug dealer. The doorbell would ring at odd hours and people would bang on the door we quickly learned simply not to answer the door because it was people looking for drugs and our friends knew our phone number. One of our neighbours was a heroin dealer a crack dealer a car thief and a generally unsavoury character. He tried to gain access to our apartment on more than one occasion every single other apartment in the building was broken into except ours. He had about  welfare recipients sleeping on his floor they gave him cashed welfare cheques and he gave them crack.  In the next building there was a cokecrack dealer. I can assure you that many of these people illegally owned firearms. We were very young trying to put ourselves through night school and the location was convenient from a transportation point of view and the rent was very very cheap.One night the banging at the outside door to the building had a particular urgency someone was trying to break the door down. We looked out the window and saw the street flooded with cops. We knew it didnt have anything to do with us so we figured the smart thing to do was stay inside. After about  minutes the cops broke through the outside building steel door through the lobby steel door and they were pounding on our door. It turned out that there had been a report of a woman being stabbed repeatedly and they had the wrong address. I often wondered if there was anything left by the time the police arrived besides hamburger.On a side note it is against the law in Canada to purchase a firearm with the intent to use it for self defense.  However if your home is invaded and you fear for your life people have used firearms in self defense to save their lives. They were charged with things like improper storage etc and many of them defended themselves in a court of law successfully. ,toronto,csmfwu0,1,t5_2qi63

Even if the decision is stupid the buyer is still the one determining the final price they pay. People buy individual cans of CocaCola for purely emotional reasons. Its not a good investment buyers have zero chance to recoup their investment. That doesnt mean the market isnt setting the price though. gt More importantly the market is not synonymous with the buyers and the market price is not synonymous with the price willing to be paid. That is most definitely not what the market is or how it works.That is literally how every market place works. Real estate market equity market local fruit market. If buyers dont agree to buy at whatever price sellers offer at either the prices go down or the market ceases to function because without trade there is no market. ,toronto,csq4jwc,2,t5_2qi63

Because everyone is tech savvy and knows what bits vs the common known filesize on their computer is.years ago being the operative phrase those who are savvy today are likely to be well aware that      megabit connections have been the norm since broadband was available and wed only get  kBs or whathaveyou from them. gt I was trying to explain how fast your bandwidth can be used up.. And youre wrong I live at yonge stclair and have a mb connection from rogers. When my gf watches netflix it affects my online gameplay and i get higher pings... So a big number mbps doesnt mean big speed. You realise that in the past few years streaming services have grown faster than the delivery technology right?Rogers ! Bell Bandwidth ! latency. gt I think you got that messed up faster speed wont make the wifi transmission better.. those were emant to ebe  different things. I mentioned faster speed for a better internet speed nothing to do with the old house. That first part was a comment for old buildings.This is what you said gt Finally if you live in an old house you might have some signal weakness because of the thickness of your walls. I would recommend you get a higher speed internet if you want the best experience.You put the two concepts together in the same paragraph and phrased it as though one were related to the other.

4553690,0,t1_ct4l32v,gtWell obviously there isnt a simple list of all this because they are a private company and this is proprietary information but here is an example of numerous different breakdowns they have tried in some markets.Fair enough this does mention one instance where Uber cut commission on UberX from  to  temporarily. It is apparently back up to  since that period.While youre not wrong on this technical point what I was getting at in discussing Ubers revenue cut is that revenuewise Uber is mostly agnostic between a dollar spent on cabs and a dollar spent on UberX. To the extent that they are not agnostic UberX is actually worse for them  lower price per ride means less revenue for Uber per ride and thats exacerbated if they have to lower their commission to compete.gtI never said nobody has ever used Uber for taxis. It is just a way way way smaller percentage of their business than UberX.I do not think you can say this with any validity without data.gtUber didnt invent this technology. Other apps such as Hailo did the same thing.Ubers app was available a year and a half before Hailos and was in fact available before Hailo existed as a company. Uber absolutely invented both this technology and marketplace.gtYou mention discounting which brings us back to price being their main point of competition. This is something they can only do with UberX since taxi fares are set by law.No when I mention discounting it is through promotional codes that give the rider  off a ride. These are just as available for taxis as for UberX in both cases Uber eats the cost of the promotion and pays the driver the regular fare.,toronto,ct4m48m,1,t5_2qi63

He wasnt charged due to the circumstances involved.  Earlier unofficial reports said that the men attacked the guard and held him down while they tried to take his gun.            The only reason why there was a possibility that the guy would be charged was due to a law that only allows armed guards to use their weapons if they were on duty and he was on break.         My guess why a conviction seemed impossible was A eyewitness reports clearly illustrated that the man could easily have felt his life was in danger.  Were the guys just bullies who wanted to fuck with him by playing keep away with his gun?  Maybe.  But he didnt know that.

They should also to make the customer aware that they are taking action and follow through.

I got caught up in all this because I gave a friend a bit of info about my impending move to Vancouver and he wrote an article about it you can find the article here. Now that my name is attached to this narrative I have a vested interest in giving good reason for why this might be important so I wrote a blog to give further detail about my situation. I believe the additional context is important that blog post can be found here.Some of you are saying that the price of rent isnt  high. True. A room in a place with  others was running about  including utilities. I am coincidentally paying about  of that at the cost of having  walls. Go figure. Itll be up to . when my roommate installs the temporary wall like fixture thats cool. That being said the price of a place to myself? Just not possible. The availability of places to share with others? Real damn slim right now.Why would I opt into a place like this? Read the blog post. Oh you want a tldr so you dont have to read my rambling blog post? Voila Because I didnt want to be pure broke due to being on student loans. My situation should be fine in a year when I graduate but I would rather not be abjectly poor until then.  Because I needed a place to stay initially and didnt have time and money to keep paying BC ferries to get to Vancouver from Victoria to look at other apartments. Especially given the options I was seeing. It made more sense to put a deposit down than keep sinking time into the search at this point given how things had gone.

4818347,0,t3_3gvhsm,Honestly Im getting quite nervous about this. Our company recently had some issues about receiving too many parking tickets downtown lately and this is now making me more uneasy. I understand ANY stopping or parking that impedes traffic flow on main roads or puts anybody else in danger should be completely off limits I agree with that  and our drivers understand that and obey it as well. Its common sense. My problem is the lack of parking in general and the unreasonable expectations and road signs on the side streets. Every time we have a new customer downtown I scout the location to see where it can be delivered. Last night I was racking my brains because obviously you cant park on the main road and all the side streets are either rammed with cars  have no truck signs no standing signs or no parking signs. I actually had to delay some deliveries until further notice so I can decide what to do. We got a ticket for parking on Soudan Ave. A wide street with plenty of room and very low volume. Surely it would have been fine for no more than  minutes. Bam ticket. In fact from the moment he walked away from the vehicle until he returned in view of the windshield was  minutes. Im at my wits end. Theres literally nowhere else to go. Theyre delivery vehicles! Have mercy! The only thing I can think of is that we can take all the tickets we receive over an extended period of time and blend it into the delivery cost by the amount of stops we make on average downtown. So the  delivery would turn into  or something if their current blitzs continue. And in turn will be passed on to the consumer. Clever way for the government to increase taxes. EDIT Just got an update from one of the drivers the only reasonable place to make a delivery for one of the stops was on Duplex Ave which was not surprisingly closed.

However any force you use must be tailored to the circumstances and you are criminally responsible for any excess force you use.gtThe law requires that a person who uses force do so in a measured way and only utilize force that is necessary and proportionate to the threat.So for example if some guy trespasses on your property he resists your arrest and you start throwing punches  youre in the wrong.

4887895,0,t3_3huhnc,If that car was making a right turn from the lane to the left of the bike lane he was making an illegal turn. Edit Unless the dividing line is solid. Streetview shows that the bike lane has a doublewhite dividing line cars are not supposed to change lanes into it. However unless the law has changed lane markings on Ontario dont carry much real legal force unlike the RoC. So that intersection is a bit of a shitshow as far as cyclist safety is concerned going west. Edit AGAIN  Taken from the Ontario HTA Section Right turn at intersection Where a driver or operator of a vehicle intends to turn to the right into an intersecting highway he or she shall where the highway on which he or she is driving has marked lanes for traffic approach the intersection within the righthand lane or where it has no such marked lanes by keeping immediately to the left of the right curb or edge of the roadway and he or she shall make the right turn by entering the righthand lane of the intersecting highway where the lane is marked or where no such lane is marked by keeping immediately to the left of the right curb or edge of the roadway being entered. Okay? You make a right turn from the right lane even when that right lane is a bike lane UNLESS the HTA has been superseded by a municipal bylaw as is the case for cycle tracks in Toronto. Also if you read the HTA you will find nothing in it that prohibits crossing a single or double white lane divider.  ,toronto,cuano9w,-3,t5_2qi63

Id already unwittingly ended up inside police lines after emerging from the subway via College Park onto College Street and right into an extremely peaceful and inoffensive antipolice demo. Ive got a photo on an old phone if I can find it of the business end of a police line on College just west of Yonge. I took that photo and then went right back inside and got the hell out of there.That was on  I think  the Thursday. As an immigrant on a work visa living near Yonge Street the thought of having the life Ive worked very hard to build here ruined by getting arrested even for doing nothing wrong whatsoever is really scary. An arrest would potentially be more than enough to ruin my immigration process.As the whole shebang was so clearly heading south even during the leadup to G the thought of what might be to come was enough to prompt me to leave town for the weekend since I dont usually like to spend the entire weekend cooped up in my apartment. I love the outdoors so I dont regret going camping but its still the only camping trip Ive ever arranged for any reason other than just I love camping.What actually transpired was much worse than I imagined.

I was in close proximity to children and their dog felt threatened by that lunged through the clothes and bit me on the leg. It didnt let go until its owners came running and screaming about how i must have done something to provoke it. Because their dog was such a suck. So well behaved. It would never just attack someone.

5069082,0,t1_cux04da,I actually hasnt even planned on moving until Aug. The reason was that the current place I am living in was a short term rental I moved in in April that was supposed to accommodate me until the condo I bought finished construction in Nov. However I got a letter from my builder in Aug that occupancy had been delayed until April of next year. These accommodations are far less than ideal but tolerable because it was temporary. I really did not want to live here until next year so it became a frantic search for a new place as soon as possible as most landlords dont even entertain leases less than a year and the more time I waited the less time Id be able sign a lease for since I would have my own place as early as April.

This quickly turned medallions Taxi licenses into an investment instrument. Rich middlemen bought many medallions and the prices went up and up and up far out of the range of affordability of average aspiring driver.The Credit Union in the case above was asking the judge to protect their investment in medallions by banning the competing technology.

5163506,0,t1_cv7sy6v,False.  Ive worked in this area for over a decade.  Colleges have little interest in protecting themselves because they arent liable for their members conduct.  For real.  Its endlessly challenging trying to work with selfappointed legal experts who refuse to listen when the process is explained to them and then get militant and bitter when things dont work out the way they envisioned.  These people instead of accepting that the outcome wasnt precisely what they wished for instead have to assign blame somewhere and frequently its the regulator.  Because they totally lack any insight into how their own conduct might have contributed to any delays in the process and because they refuse to listen when process is explained to them they get to nurse their righteous anger if a matter isnt resolved to their satisfaction.

Rome Berlin and Barcelona all have fantastic subway systems. Obviously London is the best but its only like x the size... not quite a fair comparison. It could be the culture in Western Europe vs NA but I think anyone who has traveled to any of these major cities will realize that they have it right. For smaller cities like Bern or even Amsterdam street cars and light rail are a viable option as their vehicular traffic is far less and in general more people use cycling as a means of transportation.

5256918,0,t3_3mzuwt,Each has tradeoffs.  A condo will tend to have a lot more amenities and common area than a rental apartment building will but it probably wont be subject to rentcontrol protections unless its gt  years old which applies to very few condos.  You can also be kicked out by the owner so he or his family can live in the unit which is unlikely to occur in a rental apartment.   So if security and price stability are high on your list of priorities a condo might not be ideal.  ,toronto,cvjnagp,3,t5_2qi63

5264105,0,t3_3n3iz5,Id like to think I would do something but the reality is I would assume they were homeless and move on.  When I was in university a student in his first year got very drunk and passed out in a stair well.  Several witnesses reported later that theyd seen him there and didnt want to embarrass him by approaching him andor get him help for fear he would get in trouble.  He died.  In the stairwell of his residence.  I dont remember the details now as to if he choked on his own vomit or broke his neck but he died and people stepped over him.  That has haunted me ever since  but Im also leery about getting involved on the street.  If were to see someone fall and injure themselves I would go see what I can do  as a person without a cell phone theres usually not much I can do. ,toronto,cvkjqf9,0,t5_2qi63

5276707,0,t3_3n95s5,Hi rToronto! This is Katherine Skene. Im the cochair of RaBIT the Ranked Ballot Initiative of TorontoI wanted to say thanks for all of your words of support so far. Its great to see people passionate about this and eager to contact your councillor.This vote stings. It makes it harder for us to make the case to the province. And it really is unfortunate that so many new councillors voted against muchneeded reform. We believe the province is still going to move ahead since it was a campaign promise and it was noted in the mandate letter to Minister McMeekin.Please  reach out to your councillor. Call their office during business hours. Identify yourself as a voter in their ward. Be polite and explain you are disappointedgrateful for their Oct  vote on ranked ballots. Mention that you voted for them if you did. Mention this makes you not want to vote for them in the future. They will take notice that their vote is getting so much attention especially oldschool councillors that have their staff count letters and phone calls.We have a put a lot of work into this and we know it wont be easy getting to the finish line. But its really great seeing so many positive words here. Thank you!PS if youre interested in helping us get past the finish line sign up for emails and action alerts just scroll down a bit on our website or email us directly inforabit.ca.,toronto,cvm5qyv,45,t5_2qi63

Eg countries like Italy amp Israel always need to form a coalition govt since no one party has  support. Which may be great if you liked some past Liberal laws promoted by the NDP in minority govt situations.

5521268,0,t1_cwh88jb,To me you answered your own question in your second sentence ...people who are visibly doing nothing wrong.  You can engage them in conversation sure anyone can do that in public but what is the justification for IDing them then keeping a record of their IDs and other records of the stop forever and ever without any recourse by people who were doing nothing wrong?  People are finding out years later that these records of police contact are being kept and are being supplied during information searches such as for security clearance background checks for certain types of employment etc. and this is wrong.  Police can and should talk with people as much as possible in neighbourhoods.  Talk get to know people see and be seen.  This is not carding though carding is being used to build a database that is apparently never purged the data are being used for things for which they werent originally collected the data are being selectively collected the young the nonwhite the marginalized the poor those with mental health issues and all without recourse or any effective oversight.,toronto,cwhe4b0,6,t5_2qi63

5546954,0,t1_cwkmk53,I agree her behaviour and comments are egrarious and unnecessary however she is is referring the the blue and green mural on the lower part of the wall you can sorta see it in some of the shots as graffiti ruining her garden. By garden I dont think she meant the plants but the space itself that she does not like to look at their mural while in the garden. The mural is on the videographers wall but can only be seen from her garden and she cannot legally remove it.  Im confused as to how the mural got there in the first place though.  I also felt they were baiting her a bit when dealing with a clearly irrational person there is no need to escalate the situation being noncommittal is the best course of action until the police arrive.  I thought property rights did go up into the airspace to a reasonable level?  Which is why I can trim the limbs of my neighbours shurbs if they hang over my property or why I cant build a sideways cantilevered second floor hanging over my neighbours garden or why I cant rig up a long pole with a hook and take apples from my neighbours trees while standing on my own property.  So legally they WERE on her property as far as I understand the law in Ontario although they may have legal options like applying for an easement.,toronto,cwknfrl,10,t5_2qi63

The standard policy is a flat  deduction in the mark on the assignment if youre one class late.   for the second class where its capped.I feel many people in this thread are under the assumption that a student doesnt know their mark outside of report cards.  Marks are often posted at intervals in between report cards as well usually without the sugar coat of this  lower limit.  If a student is incompetent enough where they can get below  while putting in a significant amount of effort theyre going to realize that.

I still remember scoring the winning goal against them in one game. You know the days when it was a bit damp and the ball would make a mark on the wall so you could not dispute the goal? It was one of those ones top corner. Ha ha. I also remember making an insane reflex glovesave on one of my best friends. If I bring that save up now he still remembers.

5772492,0,t3_3u5lm4,I graduated with a B.Sc. in Economics with a minor in Applied Math in . My focus was on quantitative economics. Now I work for a software company as a Business Consultant designing and implementing Retail Planning systems.I started economics because well I loved politics and the economy and Ive always been a natural when it comes to numbers. At the time it was either Economics or Accounting. It really took  years of school and  workterms in my program to figure out what I wanted to do with my degree and in the end it came down to a part time job in retail that lead me to where I am now.In general Id say Economics was a good decision. Economics taught me how to think analytically how to look at a complex system and gather reasoning and insight. it also gave me a good foundation in data analysis which can be applied in a vast number of fields today.  That being said it only played a role in getting me a career I love. By the time I finished University I had nearly a decade of experience in computer programming website design and IT support and ran a small IT business to help pay for school. This experience is what landed me a job with a software company my degree was just icing on the cake.A Econ degree is like most other degrees. It is incredibly valuable to have Id say a necessity in todays world but it only goes as far as you take it. It will give you skills that can be transferred into other fields. However you will need some other lifework experience to get a good job and hopefully a career if you do not plan on going for a Masters or PhD in Economics.,toronto,cxcmqht,2,t5_2qi63

5857868,0,t1_cxngje1,This whole thing not just your post  but the entire BLM and everything around it is a LOT to try and process and take in. I really dont want to get into a big conversation here maybe just give you some insight into how I try and get this all into my brain.Im a mid s white male raised in suburbia. There was a sprinkling of people of other descents in school sports and so forth. I was always taught by school parents amp coaches everyone was equal but that we all had our differences too. This didnt make any of us better or worse than the next. If derogatory words about race religion or sexual orientation were used towards someone they were corrected and told it was wrong.I always grew up with this. Ive had friends and partners from a wide range of backgrounds. I just kinda go through life thinking people are people.  I try and treat everyone the best I can always try my best not to offend others especially paying a little extra attention when it comes to touchy subjects like racereligionsexual orientation. This has worked excellent for me for  years. Never been called a racist or had anyone freak out on me.But in the past few years Ive been called everything under the sun and I just kinda sit there stunned. Its not that I dont want to understand its that its so overwhelming and so hard to understand. Its like learning youre this horrible person when the entire time you thought you were a pretty good one.I made a comment ages ago when a black kid got arrested no brutality nothing out of the ordinary. It was something along the lines of well he did break the law... I got absolutely screamed at as if I was this KKK leader. Woah! He got arrested for dealing drugs charged and released. Just the same I would or anyone else.  But I was this horrible person for pointing out that he broke the law and well... thats what happens  only everyone else was calling the police a bunch of racist pigs and blah blah oppressing us!Now Im this piece of shit because I dont understand the horrific oppression black people face every day. How its so much harder for them and they have to do this or that and I shouldnt be opening my privileged mouth and soforth.And I sit here trying to make sense of it. Ive just been called this absolute lowlife. Ive gone about my life trying to be a great person and all I say is hey dont deal drugs if you dont want to be charged with dealing drugs. I wouldnt dream of calling someone some derogatory name.When I see things like police brutality against anyone its upsetting  especially minorities because I know they do get targeted. Just like people of alternative sexual orientations or even these poor refugees coming in from Syria. But every so often I try and just say something I think is completely neutral and mean absolutely no disrespect then I turn around and Im being called these horrific names and Im just blindsided. Holy shit. I didnt mean to offend anyone. Im sorry! So now I just try and keep my mouth shut my head down and hope people will work this shit out sooner or later so we can all go to not taking everything people and trying to find a reason that its offensive to SOMEONE in some twisted way.Im almost afraid to even get close to anyone who is being oppressed or hated on to offer a hand and my support because then Id be exerting my privilege or something. Im just trying to be a good person but its gotten to a point I dont even know what to do anymore so I just run when something comes up because Im afraid Ill mean well but somehow fuck up.,toronto,cxnhu0r,0,t5_2qi63

5901252,0,t3_3w2n5d,I just bought a house. First time buyer here and heres my thoughts...My partner and I saved up lots of money. We knew we would have to pay the CMHC premium because wed be saving for another year before wed hit the  down on it but house prices have been going up and up so getting to that  has always been a moving target that is just out of reach. The LTT on our place was K including the first time buyers credit provincial and city. Had we been able to put that extra K down on the house our CMHC premium would have been K less. In essence the LTT cost us K since it activated a higher premium.  Our mortgage would have also been slightly less and wed be in a slightly better position when the market goes to shit. Im not saying that the city doesnt need it or that I dont like paying taxes. I actually do like taxes since it pays for all the services we use and enjoy every day and I think we actually get quite a good deal on what we get in return for what we pay. BUT Id much rather the city fund its programs from regular taxes rather than special taxes that hit people HARD when they are just trying to get a foot in the door of home ownership. My partner and I do well financially and we will be paying a lot of taxes in the years that we own this house but saving enough to buy it was difficult and not made any easier by the LTT. Id rather pay a higher tax rate so that everyone who lives in this city is paying their share. Why they target home buyers to foot the bill is beyond me. My LTT was X my annual tax bill. TLDR Im happy to pay my fair share but I dont think the LTT is fair. ,toronto,cxt6rr6,2,t5_2qi63

5920072,0,t1_cxvmfy0,First of all traffic laws and monetary regulation are two different things. From what I understand the protest this week was to call for uber or uber drivers to pay the same licensing and regulatory fees that legitimate taxi drivers do to conduct their business. Its hard to know the statistics on traffic violations made by uber drivers because uber drivers mark unmarked cars. When taxi drivers accuse uber of being illegal its not that they are saying that uber drivers are posing a threat to the public by driving poorly. Their issue is with the fact that they had to pay the regulatory fees out of their wallet making it more difficult to compete with uber drivers who do not have to pay for such licenses. Looking at things from a taxi drivers perspective you are penalized for following the law. The protest is a call to subject uber drivers to the same financial penalizations that legitimate taxi drivers are subject to.Secondly I have lived in the downtown core for the past  years and I observe countless taxi drivers in the city every day driving perfectly fine. Yes some taxi drivers do crazy things. But so do other drivers  you probably just dont notice those incidents as much because they werent all performed by cars in matching colours...tldr Its not an issue of taxis needing to provide a better product its an issue of keeping a level playing field when it comes to regulatory fees. Either reduce fees for cabs or increase them for ubers.,toronto,cxvniai,0,t5_2qi63

And if you do happen to immigrate to Canada especially recently you do have some sort of qualifications to get here or the government wouldnt have let you in.

6064223,0,t1_cyd22cx,yes.  Someone scratched a car. Someone else saw it. The End.  It didnt even happen in Toronto.  It wasnt even the guys car and he was lying all the way though.  If you read the Youtube description is shows the person video taping tried to hunt the driver down and is angry the police would not give him the cars ownership information... Because it wasnt his car that was damaged and he had no business to that information. The Police told him to move along because it was none of his business.  The Police told him he should have left a note for the REAL owner instead of lying.  It is something that happened in real life. And the cameraman made some odd decisions. Whatever...

6087439,0,t1_cyhicbm,gt Where is the threshold of too harmful?That is a great question. One theory of political decisionmaking is that we elect officials who using their own judgment in combination with advice from relevant experts make those decisions on our behalf. But that system is imperfect the decision to outlaw marijuana and not alcohol as you suggest is certainly not informed by the lessons of hard data.gt Id much rather the government tax regulate and set up robust harm reduction programs instead of trying to regulate morality.That is definitely how our current system works. But is the taxation of vices a punitive measure? A preventive one? Or merely profiting off addiction? IMHO the Canadian government speaks out of both sides of its mouth when it appeals to public health while at the same time profiting enormously off the causes of illness. That infuriates me not only on principle but also because my spouse is probably going to die from cigaretterelated illness because harm reduction programs have thus far been ineffective in helping her overcome her addition to nicotine.

6099113,0,t1_cyitoea,They are amazing. They triage things really well too. The sign I was thinking about was a spot where a singlelane road divided into two lanes right before an intersection but then merged back into a single lane half a block after the intersection without any indication which which lane got priority. Drivers in both lanes always assumed they had rightofway because it occurred around a curve so drivers turned the wheel however much they needed to get into the new lane. That one took about six months to fix.Another spot was at a threeway stop where motorists always ran the crosswalk even when pedestrians were in it because the stop sign was located after the crosswalk rather than before it. They fixed that one in less than a month.The only other sign issue I can think of is where drivers with no depth perception would make an illegal left near my place and run over a sign because the turn was too sharp. It used to happen once a week at the high point. Id report it to  and theyd have it back up in a few days but they never took seriously my suggestion to add a barrier or bollard there to stop people from doing it. I figure the sign department doesnt mind if a sign keeps getting run down once a week because it really justifies their budget if there are a thousand locations like that across the city.,toronto,cyiwnu6,1,t5_2qi63

No judging but I gave that up once I was able to actually pay for everything Hulu Netflix HBO Now Amazon Prime Showtimeits not a matter of money but my setup works better for me than all of those services combined . Im using RSS with my Torrent client to subscribe to certain shows that get downloaded automatically and are sitting on my NAS within  minutes of airing. For movies im using the Couchpotato plugin Whenever im online and see an interesting movie i just click one button in Chrome and within  seconds its downloading assuming its releasedavailable. if not itll download as soon as it is. Ive also installed that plugin on the wifes computer so she can do the same. Since ive got a MB connection we can have any movie we want within mins in perfect crisp p video and . sound Hulu Netflix are stereo iirc not sure about the others.Watching it? Ive got Kodi installed on an old AllinOne PC i keep in the kitchen so I can watch stuff while I cookclean. Ive got an android based Kodi box i bought for CAD on Aliexpress in my bedroom and another Kodi box in the living room on a micro PC Kodi even has plugins for all those pirate stream sites as well. the qualitys shit but its good if you want to browse. Tell me who I have to pay to make this setup legal and ill pay them. Even if I got the best cable package and put DVRs all over the house theres still tons of international content im missing out on.

6318582,0,t3_425xwl,gt A key issue for the judge may be whether Reilly and Guthrie were genuinely fearful of Elliott due to his tweets and if so whether their fear could be considered objectively reasonable as per the law of criminal harassment.gtMurphy argued that Guthrie and Reilly retaliated against Elliott shared his tweets and taunted him behaviour indicating they were not really afraid of him.gt The Crown responded that the complainants were entitled to speak out about harassment and warn others about their alleged harasser.gt To suggest otherwise sends a very negative message to victims that they should remain silent so that a harasser can continue preying on other individuals Goldenberg wrote.This would likely be the crux of any appeal. Id be curious to read the judges full analysis on the fear issue because it seems like hes suggesting that a victim has to play the role and never speak out.The Criminal Code requires that harassment is criminal in nature where it causes that other person reasonably in all the circumstances to fear for their safety or the safety of anyone known to them. Based on what Ive read theres no doubt it appears that Elliott harassed these women the question is whether it caused them to fear for their safety.EDIT Even if the decision in this case is sound its a troubling precedent that if youre being harassed online you cant fight back without potentially undermining any legal conclusion that you feared for your safety.EDIT  Per the decision  the judge finds that he did harass both Guthrie and Reilly but that there was no reasonable fear for their safety. The judge actually had a very reasoned analysis and I dont think theres a concern that hes dismissive of people responding to their harasser per my comment above.,toronto,cz7up61,-40,t5_2qi63

6323882,0,t1_cz8dmdy,wow. you didnt even read the story or any details. He never threatened anyone. He disagreed with their opinion regarding someone else. They disagreed with his right to disagree. Then they went through all kind of hoops to prove he was harassing them. Then they goaded him to continue the ordeal. Then they tweeted false allegations of him being a pedohile. They also had him banned from using a pc. So he was unemployed. They used all of their friends and contacts to try to ruin him. When the judicial system ripped their case apart you still cant believe he isnt harassing them. I hope he sues them till they have to turn to prostitution to make a living so they can find out what real harassment and oppression feel like. Let me guess. You are a  something year old female.

The eastern DRL does that job just fineeven if its not for you.If we build new lines they are logically going to connect to Bloor or Yonge somewhere putting more pressure on them both.

Chimpanzee Politics is considered a classic layperson book in that it presents broad findings about chimpanzees and implies that human behaviour could be inferred from it. However as is noted in multiple peer reviews it is unlikely to be of much use to the scientific community given its nonempirical nature most of the observations are human interpretations. The second article is highly specific to capuchin monkeys. It makes absolutely no inferences towards human behaviour. It does not even mention human behaviour. It essentially says that alpha capuchins interact more with other capuchins and also that guarding females who are of a higher social heirarchy helps capuchin monkeys become more successful at reproduction.Its definitely not the alpha wolf pack controls everything betas suck blah blah trope.

Theres some very interesting research showing that abuse and trauma survivors get an immense rush of dopamine and norepinephrine from abuse because of the fightorflight response but it ends up becoming a selfreinforcing addiction like gambling or any other addictive behavior.Of course theres no way to know why this victim reached out to her abuser it couldve been for revenge or closure just as much as seeking more abuse its impossible to know without deep analysis.,toronto,czmdzt5,22,t5_2qi63

Its easy for an abuse victim to say I kicked that asshole to the curb and never saw him again so much that she believes it because it gives her the power to move on with her life. Everyone likes to think that if they were assaulted they would take control of the situation and keep their power. But the reality is that many women stay with their abusers try to smooth things over blame themselves and try to get back on their abusers good side by sending apologetic emails going on dates pretending its all okay etc. Its common its horrifying for the victim to remember she did that and most importantly it doesnt mean the assault wasnt occurring or didnt happen.Just something to keep in mind before you start calling for these womens heads. Ghomeshi probably will get off on these charges and maybe he should  maybe theyll find that he did nothing technically illegal. But  women coming forward on top of formal complaints says enough about his character. Even if its found he did nothing illegal I wouldnt go so far to say Oh poor Jian he needs mens rights women are so evil!. ,toronto,czqbqol,19,t5_2qi63

In a situation where it was just them with him it lasted and the specific female was his only companion and no other women were involved it was perfectly fine. Lets be honest... some women indulge in sexual encounters with their superiorsbosses to gain financially via promotions or opportunities. When this doesnt work out their way they are angry bitter and wish nothing more than this person that manipulated them gets punished...ironically though this is only AFTERWARDS and IF their PROMOTION doesnt last.Character and financial assassination anyone?

6556444,0,t1_czxf82h,A lot of what you say is true but youre easily dismissing Vinces impact and marketability when they should be taken into account.Yes there have been Canadians in the NBA before but theres just one problem.  Nobody knew they were Canadian!  With the new batch announcers make it a point to mention their home town.  Of all the things Rick Fox was known for being Canadian was not one of them.  Why is that?  Steve Nash was the first marquee player the league media and US consistently acknowledged as being from the north.If Vince was simply a name on the roster then why didnt Damon Stoudamire get the same kind of accolade?  Mighty Mouse was with the franchise from day  marketed as new face of Canadian basketball and won rookie of the year in the Raptors inaugural season.  It literally doesnt get any bigger yet it wasnt perceived as a big deal when Stoudamire very similar to Carter a few years later demanded a trade.  Nobody looks at Damon fondly the way the do Vince.  Both arguably had similar careers.  Not quite superstars but able to play a solid supporting role.So I absolutely believe Carter had an it factor that other players were not able to achieve here.  Using the Huskies is seriously reaching.  I was a fan of the game before the Raptors existed but most people werent.  In another thread Im arguing with a someone who still thinks Toronto is a hockeyonly town.So I dont believe its a last desperate plea.  Maybe it just that drunk competition and nothing else that provide us with the strong memories but he was the face of the franchise when it reached its first playoff birth and to date only playoff series win.There was a great documentary last year that detailed the full story of what happened in .  Vince is obviously guilty but Rob Babcock was terrible GM who should have shared just as much of the guilt.  One of the surprising facts that I didnt know was that Carter had pulled his trade demand in  and asked to remain with the franchise just weeks before being traded.  By then Babcock had made up his mind and opted to trade Vince for literally nothing in what would probably be the worst deal in franchise history.,toronto,czxhnjx,1,t5_2qi63

For NFL there were VLC links that I could pop into Microsofts Edge browser but not Chrome for some reason that would work brilliantly.  The quality was just jawdropping.  I also have Kodi installed and theres a sportsdevil plugin that works wellenough.If youre into the NFL CTV typically airs  games each Sunday which means  free perfect HD games in addition to whatever you can pickup from the Buffalo channels.I do pay for mlb.tv but during the Jays run there was no shortage of online streams I was handing those links out like candy to all my cable cutting friends who kept asking me how to watch shortly after jumping on the bandwagon.Basketball and Hockey streams are hit or miss quality wise but I can usually find something with a solid frame rate and they dont look too bad even on a monster TV.  Having a dedicated HTPC certainly helps and is far more flexible than any smart tvxboxandroid box IMO.To prepare yourself try to live without your cable box for a week and see how it goes.

TD expects their house prices to go down less than  this year. Condos will take the brunt of the drop but single family dwellings will barely fall. Even with that  drop the market is still too hot. You cant blame the Chinese for that one. Theres just too much appetite for real estate in Canada. In any other place so reliant on oil the housing market would be in absolute tatters but instead we get a  drop in prices during a period when unemployment is expected to increase by nearly Many have said recession is what it will take to knock the air out of our housing market but looking at Alberta a province that is very clearly in a deep recession that doesnt seem to be the case...and thats a good thing for the economy a  correction in the housing market would have a horrific knockon effect on the rest of the economy but it STILL means housing is unaffordable to the average Calgarian who probably has far less job security and may be making less money than a few years ago.One then wonders if unaffordable housing is the new normal in Canada.

6825958,0,t1_d0pm14a,Secret shoppers.  Most major retailers use them either through an agency or they employ their own.  In my experience they are usually middle aged and I cant imagine that the LCBO is employing underage people to go in to their stores and potentially walk out with booze that cant be legal.  Their purpose is not only to see if they are being carded there is usually a checklist of things that they have to go through.  When I worked at HMV the secret shoppers would have to call first and inquire about something to check our phone performance then they would come to the store and ask about something else and there were certain protocols and procedures that were to be followed if we had it or didnt.  Employees are usually shown the list of requirements like customer must be greeted within X amount of time upon entering the store customer must be asked if they require assistance within X amount of time after entering the store.  Depending on the retail environment and how good they are you can often spot them a mile away because they ask questions that normal customers just dont ask.  The general attitude is that anyone could be a secret shopper so you treat everyone the same way.  People get fired all the time over a bad secret shopper score Ive worked in places where a score lower than  is automatic termination.      ,toronto,d0q0sl6,2,t5_2qi63

6864874,0,t1_d0ue587,gt Source for either of these? Again I really dont give a fuck if the experts say that running two services sidebyside wasnt practical.Theres been hoardes of media coverage explaining why SmartTrack wasnt possible since the campaign. Theyre readily available online. Steve Munros site is the best source. gtWhat matters is the actual product thats delivered  will you be able to use your subway fare on the Stouffville and Kitchener Go Lines with frequent twoway service and stops at most or all major roads? Cause thats whats important not whether theres a separate Go Train or one single service.No you almost certainly wont unless the City of Toronto pays an inordinate subsidy thats the only way its happening. Regional rail operations have a significantly higher cost per customer than subways. Metrolinx is looking at fare integration and all the options theyre looking at has some combination of premium on regional travel which would include SmartTrack.gtAgain source for this? Would the subway have been recommended to run on King instead if there was no SmartTrackRER or was this just one of many factors involved in the decision?You can find a reference to this on Page  of the presentation embedded on this page Note that a lot of this information Im telling you is either what has been told to me by City Planning staff my conversations with people in the transit field or based on conversations between City Planning and politicians. Not everything is going to be readily available in a document. But I can assure you that one of the primary motivations for a Queen Relief Line alignment is that it spread transit coverage away from the SmartTrack corridor. This is something thats been mentioned to me and multiple times at City Planning public consultations.gtOption C from the link has  stations within Toronto including  new ones. That isnt marginally more its a significant improvement that connects St. Clair West Liberty Village Riverdale Leslieville and Scarborough directly to downtownOption C wont be selected. It has a significant negative impact on regional travel times outside of Toronto. Its open knowledge that Metrolinx staff prefer Option D and that well likely see about  stations added. Its going to take a lot of wrangling to get any more stations that that and ML staff arent exactly pleased with SmartTrack. Specific station positioning is yet to be determined though I can say for certain there wont be a station at Spadina and there will be a station at Unilever. gtBy the time this is built its very likely that therell be one fare system for the entire GTHA. It may mean that the subway has a distancebased fare while buses and streetcars have a flat fare but the RER fare would still be the same as the subways.TTC fare has always implied that theyll be no premium attached to SmartTrack service. All of the proposed fare integration concepts would attach a premium to SmartTrack gtWhy? Because the line they were promised a year ago still hasnt been built? I doubt anyone would be let down by that.No because what they were promised isnt being built at all. They were promised  station  km surface subway system with TTC fares that would be complete in  years. SmartTrackRER will not successfully deliver a single item on that list.gtAgain who the hell cares? Call it a surface subway call it surface rail call it John Torys stupid choochoo or even call it ridesharing  the name doesnt make anyones commute faster or simpler. What actually makes a difference in peoples lives is how quickly they can get from point A to point B.You may not care. I personally dont care Im quite happy to see SmartTracks western part replaced with light rail. But the subways subways subways crowd who were specifically promised subways will not be happy. Whether or not you and I agree with them is irrelevant. This is politics and theyre right to feel let down by Tory especially since railway engineers told Tory since day  that heavy rail surface subways for SmartTrack would not work.gtExcept its not. Last time I checked these arent exactly light.The SmartTrack western spur has been replaced by onstreet LRT as proposed in Transit City.,toronto,d0ufzqr,1,t5_2qi63

6899867,0,t1_d0yapnw,gt The polices job is to take shit seriously all the time.    This is a nonsensical soundbite answer which really only sounds convincing out of context and in the absence of cognition.  The police need to assess the threat implied by a situation.  They dont simply run headlong with the riot squad every time someone calls the dispatcher and says theres this guy who looks shifty on the street nearby or someone called me but then they just hung up  I think theyre after me.  Frivolous complaints are business as usual for municipal police.  If you think they treat all complaints as equivalently serious without assessing the real probability of there being a genuine threat you cant be very familiar with police services or the real world generally to be frank.    gt That doesnt make the threat illegitimate    Wait a minute  the threat being unrealisable doesnt make it illegitimate?  You can make legitimate mean whatever you want for your purposes I guess the same way Todd Akin did when he invented legitimate rape but for most of us a legitimate threat is one which can exist.  Make believe things are not legitimate threats for us.  If you want to live in a city where police go around chasing after nonsensical exaggerations and overwrought metaphors all day rather than bothering with actual crimes or threats of them I guess thats your prerogative.  But here in the real world most of us prefer police services to act on imminent dangers to the public weal rather than poetical flourishes and thoughtcrime.  ,toronto,d0yf2qb,6,t5_2qi63

Like I said before Im not worried about my dog biting anyone. If my dog bites you its because you broke into my place or you are a direct threat to my life. When you have a properly trained dog you dont have to worry about them being aggressive and if they are being aggressive there is a damn good reason for them to be aggressive and its usually warranted. Before you make assumptions on the internet you should really look up what it takes to be a dog owner and the hard work it takes to have an obedient dog.

Sportsnet already had a streaming service and had probably  of the technical infrastructure in place to support adding this new service. They can freely drop the price of the service to make it profitable should they feel the need. To top it all off if youre a customer you can see that subscribing to Sportsnet on your cable package allows you online streaming access as well and is cheaper than this purely online subscription. This potentially will drive more cable subscriptions for Rogers and Sportsnet.Im not seeing how this is delusional behaviour at all.

Im going to try to do gradually longer walks this summer to get in shape starting with walking from where I live near Coxwell to downtown which I can still do but not without my feet hurting the next day and hopefully building up to being able to walk to High Park or even Humber Bay or to the zoo which is a comparable distance but in the other direction and not be completely exhausted.My family has a couple of longdistance cycling fans including one who regularly commuted from Moss Park to Jane and Eglinton by bike and back yearround while in her late s ! but Ive never found biking to be fun. For me biking is for when you need to get somewhere walking is for when you want to go somewhere.

7381219,0,t1_d2h0bfb,gt Well given that the metro stops range from  metres to . kilometres yes in some cases absolutely. It makes sense to have on stop St. George the next at Museum. It doesnt make sense to have a stop on both sides of Royal York Rd.It does from a safety perspective. The TTC wants to minimise the risk of passengers jaywalking to get to their stop Eglinton and Bayview is an even bigger and busier intersection than Royal York and it has stops on both sides for all four directions of travel. What you are doing is advocating for huge distances more like youd find in a rural or industrial area not a city. This is completely contrary to the research done by actual transit planners.gtSo two people going to obtain food to eat and one has a legitimate journey the other doesnt. That makes sense.So does making that old lady walk at least half a kilometre likely more unless she lives on the same street the bus runs on to even get on the bus so that you can discourage the kids from taking a journey that to you is both frivolous enough to require dramatically increasing the space between stops to discourage but entirely legitimate if they do get on it anyway. Make up your mind.gtWhether or not someone has paid makes literally no difference.When you take it out of context like that you can twist it to sound bad. The rest of what I said was that they were already on the transit system going somewhere. They didnt go into the subway station just to get on the bus to ride it one stop.gtSo then walk the bloody  minutes.If it was me I would.

7467717,0,t3_4hl6bn,I worked on a lettuce farm off Hwy  just north of Dundas Ontario for two summers when I was a teenager ages  amp .  Long hours of hard labour.  But the pay was better than minimum wage we even got regular  cent raises which is unusual in the world of farm labour but the farmer was dutch reform so that probably contributed to a paying us fairly and b probably he was a little racist since he preferred to hire Canadian students  By the end of my second summer I was making .hour at the time I think minimum wage was . or something.  Add to that the fact that no other summer job would have given me so many hours and I think I did alright for a teenager.I only worked there two summers because I became allergic to the juice that leaks out of lettuce onto your hands when you harvest them bent over with a small paring knife.  You cant wear gloves thin gloves will get cut up by the knife since gloves cant form callouses thick gloves dont allow the dexterity you need to be as fast as you have to be to do the job. The lettuce bleeds this milky white fluid and it started to cause these little fluid filled bumps that would itch and peel.  Lettuce man.  Everything fights back when you kill it.I drove tractors got a LEGIT farmers tan socks  workboots hat line obviously tshirt sleeves.  Some of the other girls wore tank tops to avoid at least the tshirt sleeves but I was a lot bustier than they were and like I said dutch reform farmer.  He probably would have sent me home.  Dirt got GROUND into my hands mechanics soap couldnt get them clean.  So between that and the fact that I was working and I mean WORKING  unless it was lunch or your  minute break you were moving fast  hours a day  days a week Never so glad to have a Christian boss we got Sundays off! its not like I was going to be socializing much anyway.Alright so wed start at am.  Ride out on the wagon pulled by a  year old Ford tractor named Betsy to the field we were going to be harvesting that day.  A few parcels of waxed cardboard boxes on the wagon with us wrapped with a tough plastic band.  Wed jump off the wagon and cut the band and all grab a box and build them as quick as possible takes  seconds if you know what youre doing then run out to a row to start cutting.  Lettuces were planted four to a row.   You put the box on the ground and start harvesting placing your lettuces in it.  The boxes were the right size depending on the type of lettuce leaf amp boston had the same size box but you packed them differently Romaine had a larger box.  Youd finish your box run it over to the wagon open grab another box restart.  It took  of us about  minutes to fill the wagon.  Thered be another wagon with boxes waiting two would go back with the full one to wash the lettuces just spraying water from a hose onto them  why its so important the boxes are waxed close the boxes amp pack the skids and pull them into the cooler.  Throwing a lb box of Romaine onto a  foot skid.  I was the only girl tall enough for that part of the job  I always opted to go back with the full wagon if I could because I found being bent over harvesting harder than tossing boxes.  Lazy PThen wed bring the wagon back out to the field and help cut the few remaining boxes.  Usually we took turns going back to the barn but not everyone enjoyed it so I got lots of turns throwing.  Break in the farmhouse at  Sunmaid raisin bread with margarine and bottles of that Fruite drink provided by the farmers wife.  Lunch at  we brought our own.  Break in the field at  or  depending on when someone would bring it out to us in a cooler with an ATV.  Cans of pop or more Fruite or iced tea.  Voortman cookies always.  Basically sugar for energy and we actually needed it.  The farmers sons birthday was sometime in July and we got fried egg sandwiches at the morning break.  Food is delicous when you work that hard.We did this in rain we did this when it was  degrees with sun scorching the backs of our legs.  Sometimes it got too hot.  The lettuces would wilt if we harvested them in the heat like that and wed harvest until  and then wed get to weed the beet field.  This was essentially busy work  the farmer trying to keep his employees paid.  The beets couldnt have been profitable enough to justify all the man hours spent weeding and thinning the beets.  Fucking beets.  Wed have to take some out if they were growing too close together the boys got into the habit of whipping the thinned beats at each other.  Leaving massive purple welts on their clothes.  Im sure the farmer knew we were goofing off when we came back looking like wed been through a war with Barney.Anyway all this is to say  a lot of work a lot of actual blood cutting your hands with the knives sweat duh and tears the farmer was old school and hed really lay into you if you fucked up or werent working fast enough... definitely not even really acceptable workplace behaviour even then went into these goddamn lettuces.Wed get them in the cooler.And there theyd sit.Sometimes like at the start of the season theyd be gone that day.  Often theyd sit for  days or for a week sometimes for a week and a half before the truck would come to bring them to the Ontario Food Terminal.  Sometimes wed pull an older skid out trim the bottoms off the lettuces if theyd gone too brown and repack them. We could only sell at a certain price otherwise we lost money.  If the price was too low Quebec producing too much was a common issue in later summer months we couldnt sell.  Sometimes wed dump whole skids of lettuce into the fenced in area where the farms pet sheep were kept.  The farmer and his wife had nine daughters followed by their only son.  Youngest daughter was allergic to EVERYTHING but the youngest son wanted a dog.  He got a couple of lambs which were soon sheepSomeone from the farmers market used to come and take the fancy curly lettuces wed grow specifically for that purpose.  When we knew she was coming wed cut those fresh that day and put them into these reuseable plastic crates.  Volume was very low compared to the whole operation though.All in all a very interesting job for a nerdy suburban girl.  Plus I learned to swear in dutch and I figured out that sometimes you can figure out a strategy to deal with a difficult person that will work all the time.  I was good at improving the bosss mood which improved the work for all of us.Anyway I worked on a lettuce farm.

7557863,0,t1_d30lmt4,gt Dispensaries create a safe environment for those who enjoy it to get their drugsIn theory they do however there is absolutely no guarantee of that at this point and thats a problem. People seem to think that opening a store somehow magically makes the product high quality and without contaminants not grown in pesticides etc but without any type of regulation you have to take the stores word for it and Im not sure how thats any different than a dealer apart from perception. Also  or  different shops arent needed on  city block. gtI really cant understand the objection to these dispensaries.Ive said it before and will likely say it again a big problem currently is that in many cases dispensaries are acting as a doctor or pharmacist when someone brings in a prescription they received for an illness that the dispensary believes cannabis can assist with. It doesnt matter which side of the argument you are on this just isnt great idea for anyone involved. Enforce age restrictions and promote safe and ethical use but dont try and act like an alternative pharmacy.

7558989,0,t1_d31dihu,I dont see why corner stores are such an inappropriate comparison.  Tobacco is a very relevant and the only reason youve presented otherwise is that we did it differently before.  But regulations regarding the selling of tobacco have changed over time so it is something we revisit and update to our current standards and mores.  On the issue with the distribution of alcohol  since that is also an age restricted substance that is recreationally consumed in mass quantities I agree that LCBOstyle distribution is worth considering and I will also punt on the question of selling of alcohol in nonLCBO stores.Regardless my point with that comparison is that we do have mechanisms to address the distribution of agerestricted materials and they are permissive.  Your observation of the light industrial zoning permitted uses is interesting  Id like to note that limiting dispensaries to light industrial is more restrictive than for either corner stores or LCBOs.  A minimum setback to schools is also something that does not apply to either corner stores or LCBOs.  A limit to the number of facilities in any given neighbourhood?  Also not a restriction faced by corner stores or LCBOs.Thats my point.  The restrictions being proposed for dispensaries are unique and unwarranted.  Despite the fact that we already have numerous products and services which are restricted access which are extremely permissive in their siting  we are treating the siting of pot dispensaries like factories.  We also age restrict access to lottery tickets and gambling but those sure are easy to get.  Bingo halls and charity casinos arent restricted in the manner were proposing for dispensaries.  Those are also facilities you can find in locations intended for children to be in like amusement parks and fairs.  They can also be located in areas not zoned industrial.On the issue about the illegal practice and medical need issue  if we are to develop sensible rules we need to ignore this point.  Recreational use will be legal soon.  We need to develop an appropriate regulatory regime for those conditions.  If we end up treating these quasilegal activities as legitimate a few months early  that is no different from what we are doing now only well have more structure to it and a sensible goal of well integrated and regulated pot use going forward.One more observation  look at how permissive we are with smokes and lottery tickets both things with serious addiction risk.  How much underage contraband do you think there is on the cigarette and lottery ticket front?  Alcohol is much more restrictive with an effective monopoly supplier.  Do you think more teens drink or smoke or buy scratch and wins?Edit  changed a word or two,toronto,d31f5h2,1,t5_2qi63

7860978,0,t3_4mzgu5,Even if people would mostly be turning in legal firearms  so what?  I think such a program would still be a net benefit if it gets even minor use.The prevalence of firearms in society  legal or illegal  is closely related to firearm suicides which is often an impulsive act and firearms are more successful than almost any other method.  Theres every reason to believe that reducing the number of firearms in Toronto will reduce the number of firearm suicides in Toronto.  Which is about  people a year or several times that of the number of firearm murders.And legally owned firearms are routinely diverted by theft or loss to criminal uses.  This seems like it would be a particular risk for firearms their owners care so little for that theyll trade them in like that.

7866420,0,t3_4n26pu,I have so much to say about this.  Im old enough to remember when people talked on the phone and made amp kept social plans.  I watched my grandparents have neighbours over for coffee or to play cards or cribbage or go for evening walks and consistently get Christmas and birthday cards from friends and coworkers they first met decades ago.Now people dont make an effort.  They wont commit to plans they flake out of FOMO or laziness or social anxiety. Why does everyone have social anxiety now?  I never even heard of that growing up.  The lack of actual socializing in childhood probably doesnt help.  Forget talking on the phone.  Forget nocost unhip activities like walks and cardplaying.  It has to be something that will look good on your Instagram.Plus social interaction feels far more transactional now.  Like you get sized up for your potential usefulness right away and if you fail to meet expectations in that regard you get dropped fast.  I feel like a lot of people literally do not know how to have a conversation that is just about getting to know each other having a laugh and so on.  Unfortunately Ive had to clean house of several friends who simply could not talk about any subject but themselves and never returned a favour.  People who offered literally nothing at all in the way of friendship but had very high expectations for receiving it.And this is among people who do not have challenges like age disability poverty etc.I feel like we society have dug ourselves into a deep hole with this stuff and in all seriousness I think it would take something like a sustained crisis for us to overcome it.,toronto,d409ay0,74,t5_2qi63

8121277,0,t1_d4shbbe,American stats make it clear to me that more guns makes everyone less safe. I dont think concealed carries deter crime so much as increase incidents of crime. The fact is the very presence of a gun in your house increases the chance of violent death including suicide. You are statistically less likely to actually use a gun to defend your family than you are to experience a domestic murder or suicide in your household with that weapon. From the Washington PostThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun. says Wayne LaPierre the vice president of the National Rifle Association.The challenge to that argument is that data show guns are rarely used in selfdefense  especially relative to the rate at which theyre used in criminal homicides or suicides. A recent report from the Violence Policy Center a gun control advocacy group put those numbers in some perspective and I dug up the raw numbers from the FBIs homicide data. In  there were  criminal gun homicides in the FBIs homicide database but only  gun killings by private citizens that were deemed justifiable which the FBI defines as the killing of a felon during the commission of a felony by a private citizen.That works out to one justifiable gun death for every  unjustifiable gun deaths.Or look at it this way. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that in  there were  suicides by gun. That works out to one selfdefense killing for every  gun suicides. CDC data show that there were more than twice as many accidental gun fatalities as as justifiable killings.From the EconomistOther studies have reached similar conclusions. An analysis published in  for example using detailed countylevel data assembled by the National Research Council a governmentfunded body suggested that laws that allow people to carry weapons are associated with a substantial rise in the incidence of assaults with a firearm. It also found evidence that such laws might also lead to increases in other crimes like rape and robbery. A recent survey of  studies concluded that strict guncontrol laws do indeed reduce deaths caused by firearms....It is not just the relationship between gun ownership and gun violence that is becoming clearer. Evidence is also building that even relatively modest guncontrol measures reduce gun deaths. An analysis published in  in the Annual Review of Public Health noted that state laws banning possession of a gun by individuals under a restraining order for domestic violence reduce the incidence of intimate partner homicide by . The same analysis reports that firearm homicide rates rose by  in the five years after Missouri repealed its law requiring permits to purchase a gun even as the national rate nationwide fell.,toronto,d4swkfa,1,t5_2qi63

BLM wouldnt have done this with say the Santa Claus parade or St. Pattys Day.  However in Minneapolis last October BLMMinnesota threatened to form a human chain at the  mile mark of the Twin Cities Marathon to prevent anyone from finishing  they didnt  but believe me they would do it.  They did it because the political leanings of Pride make it easy for groups like BLM to fake their interest get into the parade and pull this stunt.  I would have LOVED if the thousands in the parade wouldve said fuck this! and just charged on over these BLM people.  I came out at  and have been involved with Pride for years.  And believe me I dont like how corporate the eventparade has become  I dont like the attitude that unless you look like you have money or have a nice body or arent wearing expensive clothes etc you arent welcome but thats how Pride has become.  Its a place to show off how good you look and how much money you have while looking down on those who dont.  I see no POC snubbed at the parade.  I do see people who arent very successful in life who definitely dont feel like they deserve to go to Pride and THAT is sad to me.  It should be good enough just to be gay  not be gay and have money not be gay and oh youre over  so stay home and hide we dont want to see you...or be gay and look perfect...the whole point of coming out is to be gay and JUST BE.  Dont get me started on how horribly the gay community treats each other. exhalingAnyway Im pissed that BLM used our parade to hijack their agenda simply because they could Im pissed that the guy in charge of pride doesnt have the balls to call BLM out on their shit and Im personally so tired of this pc bullshit thats going on to the point where our parade isnt going to mean anything except a great spot for advertisers and notgay political groups seeking massive exposure and media coverage.  ,toronto,d50292j,42,t5_2qi63

8384080,0,t1_d5phori,. Im not saying there isnt any racism among cops but is it really systemic racism from police or is it maybe the fact that one group of people in TorontoGTA commit much more crime violence and murder than virtually every other group of people BY FAR and it aint even close. With that in mind shouldnt the police do the common sense thing and concentrate their efforts and resources towards that group of people to try and reduce or even eliminate crime among those people?? You can debate that some of their methods are unfair but to say police are racist for fighting crime where crime exists IS NUTS. And yes I have issues with BLM because they DO NOT CARE about the loss of black life unless that life is lost at the hands of police so that they can point the finger and cops and say see it happened again!!. Yet if that exact same life is lost at the hands of their own people somehow BLM makes ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF IT. So you tell me how is it that one black life lost at the hands of police matters so much yet that exact same life lost at the hands of other black people doesnt warrant the same anger among the BLM folks? Could it be because it doesnt fit their narrative that cops are racist and black people are mistreated rather than saying a black life lost is a black life lost REGARDLESS of who took it? Seriously I dont know why discussing the hypocrisy of BLM is so taboo these days. gtgt. Yes it doesnt mention that black people are involved YET but looking at the incident its  certain that if the suspects are ever found that it will likely be black males involved. This is based on decades worth of history and data where the overwhelming majority of these kinds of incidents involve black people.

Yes a little bit of NIMBY is involved but with good reason. The islands have been around for a very long time and like I said if they wanted to re gap the islands with a bridge they would have already done so. You may not recall but the islands at one point were not islands. Hurricane Hazel in the s washed out the eastern gap creating the islands. IMO it should stay an island with no bridges.

However if you are looking for examples in IsraelPalestine you could probably draw some even though the political and cultural context is very different.  For Israelis there were the Jewish National Council and the Jewish Agency for Palestine on the progressive side and paramilitary organizations like Haganah and Irgun on the revolutionary side.For Palestinians you could point to the modern Palestinian Liberation Organization after the Oslo Accords as the progressives while the secularist Rejectionist Front and later Islamist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad would be the revolutionaries.  Even within Hamas there is tension between the moderates who formed the Change and Reform slate in the  elections and the revolutionaries in the Qassam Brigades.To be clear I am not trying to equate revolutionaries with terrorists.  Although many revolutionary groups I have cited include those who have committed terrorism e.g. FLQ Irgun Hamas I am drawing the distinction based on ideology rather than activities.

Example... tonight at  PM transit control short turned three buses going southbound leaving the next southbound bus arriving in  minutes. Explain to me how that makes sense coming from transit control and supervisors in charge. If you make a post asking people you will get a lot of comments about how TTC management has made decisions regarding service that makes people wonder if anyone actually knows what theyre doing.

This is what happened in Montreal.One thing that keeps casinos fresh in vacation destinations like Vegas is that you are constantly rotating the crowd and the crowd is not just there to gamble. There are millions of travelers to Toronto every year but they have too many options to choose from for entertainment and many are here for work.Professional gamblers and high rollers wont be going because casinos compete internationally for this money and the OLG will stack the odds in their favor so much that they wont be interested in gambling here.

8717708,0,t1_d6vcfym,They probably dont want to put any money into the old street cars.Someone mentioned the idea in another thread but I think it would be better to make it clear that the street car is slowing down to let off passengers.  Sometimes on roads like Queen Street there are a TON of street car stops and if cars are constantly slowing down just because maybe the TTC will drop someone off they dont really get very far..  It is the same with a bus I always yield to a bus when their signal light is on.I think there should be a bit of a buffer if the street car door is open then step down but look before you actually cross.  Even if all of the cars stop it seems that it is very common that a bike will go through so best to always be cautious and be looking around instead of just assuming it is safe to cross.   Example as a driver cars are suppose to stop if they are able to on a yellow light but often times they will accelerate instead and if you are waiting to turn and just assume well legally they should stop then you are going to get tboned if you proceed without knowing for sure they have stopped.  Not saying it should be that way but just safer for everyone.,toronto,d6vcplp,4,t5_2qi63

Which sounds nice in theory but the logic breaks down rather quickly. Because no one is smarter than a timed traffic light. No one has the sense and awareness to see everything around them perfectly at all times  a cyclist might think its safe to go through a red light like theyve done a million times before but just in doing that simple action theyve immediately increased their chances of hitting a car or pedestrian or being hit by a car by a significant degree.And it isnt just safety its also consideration.,toronto,d7tnokr,2,t5_2qi63

9454193,0,t1_d9dxh0p, Good Question! The whole city is part of various watersheds all draining down to Lake Ontario and development and paving over the ground does increase the flooding risk as the rain then can flow overland quicker and then we have too much volume trying to go downstream all at once.  Everything gets backed up and flooding ensues generally from the bottom up.  The City right now is trying to remedy this by increasing the ability of the ground to retain and detain water upstream so it will enter the drainage pipe system slower so capacity isnt overwhelmed.  This includes wet and dry ponds underground storage tanks catchbasins that retain more water pipe twinning and increasing some pipe sizes its all part of the Basement Flooding amp Water Quality Improvement Study.  We can help too by disconnecting our downspouts and having permeable ground cover like grass instead of paving our lawns over anything to slow the water down a bit. Flooding in the Don Valley is also increased by the fact that the river has a right turn at the bottom this is in the process of being rectified that turn has been there for decades at least.Building on the moraine is also a problem but its more one that affects the ability and rate of groundwater recharge.  If there isnt enough moisture in the ground plants wetlands animals and agriculture are negatively affected Torontos underground rivers wont function properly and fire risks can really increase.  ,toronto,d9edwns,4,t5_2qi63

So its not their own land in any sense except that they claim it to be theirs.Furthermore while indigenous rights are an issue here it is utterly misleading to act like this is other than yet another front in the ongoing protest war led by environmental groups that use indigenous people only when they are a convenient vehicle for antipipeline protests. It doesnt play as well in the media when a bunch of white professional protester hippies occupy property and prevent pipeline construction. It plays a lot better in the public relations sphere if the occupation is instead led by a bunch of indigenous people because their historical mistreatment serves as effective insulation against criticism of the protests.,toronto,d9q66fs,1,t5_2qi63

Implicit in that claim is that there is some merit to vinyl which improves the experience of listening to Leonard Cohen.There isnt. There are no vinyl only albums being offered there is just some idiotic affection for obsolete technology.Your point is not relevant. The celebration of Leonard Cohen with vinyl is simply stupid hipsterism based on the idea that old garbage is something different than old garbage.

Also many rent so this is a huge variable Cableinternet cellphone utilities huge variable because some do not have cable andor some have blind loyalty and pay higher prices without shopping around therefore  a month is still reasonable  Transportation   I lowballed here to  metro passes and I didnt even factor in the MDP savings because you live in the city and IMO if you need a car thats a bit silly Ive covered the basics I believe     Gross   Expenses     months   annually. Spending on children clothing has always been obscene and this is where most people see there money vanish because they think aww thats so cute or he or she needs this cute toy accessory etc. But that is still  in miscellaneous spending for clothing entertainment eating out per year which is still pretty darn good. I also imagine that your company provides a bonus usually jobs that pay this much will at major companies see telecom insurance banking? RRSP? Dentalhealth benefits?

For example against the Warriors he if I remember correctly drove the lane in three straight possessions near the end of the game. In all three cases the defence was established the exact same way anticipating his move. I believe he was blocked twice by Durant in the same place in those three drives. Instead of relying on situational awareness to maybe pass up to another player instead of being tripleteamed in the lane he elected to take the shot himself.By clutch I meant clutch play not necessarily clutch shot.

10221453,0,t1_dc0l37r,LOL now youre speaking without having a grip on reality taken into account. Hong Kong is a perfect example of a good transit system. I dont see how its considered a bad example I mean if Im high and see wild unicorns then maybe. They have connections to all parts of the city while still operating their system fully well into the morning. The TTC has consistent delays and closures every weekend. In Hong Kong that happens too but not every weekend and if one line closes the people in that city have multiple alternate routes to take. London also has a pretty good transit system too that operates on that same type of operation. And both of those cities have built up their transit system in the span of a few decades. Weve had ours for multiple decades and yet weve only been able to add a few lines. You compare LA to Toronto but LA has substantially much more area to serve compared to Toronto so youre not taking that into account. Ours isnt good and if you think its good then clearly you havent been outside of North America. North America isnt the gold standard of public transit. It hasnt been like that for a while. And even when comparing with other North American cities ours is pretty shit.,toronto,dc2nq6o,1,t5_2qi63

10273602,0,t1_dc871g1,As in Chicago Transit Authority?Ive never lived in chicago but ive visited. CTA is much better than TTC. CLeanliness levels were about the same but the CTA actually had trains that went all over the city. I didnt encounter any delays. And you had a regular train that goes to the airport. Lots of transfer stations too serving multiple lines. Im not entirely sure where chigaco proper ends and the suburbs begin but it looks like they also had train service.Take a CTA train map and rotate it  degrees so lake michigan becomes lake ontario. Overlay that onto a TTC train map. You will see what I mean.Thats not to say the TTC is all bad. If the subway is going where you are going its relatively efficient if there arnt any closures. When there are closures though there isnt much of an alternative.Busses and subways can be kind of a nightmare. Very crowded during rush hour times.

10459777,0,t1_dctipuh,It is difficult to understand and conceptualize what is and isnt affordable or when prices will stabilize in Toronto when we take into consideration that Toronto is Canadas only truly global city with the worlds th largest financial centre. One of less than  that is considered global and not just continental or national by financial standards.I do agree that this level of increase is far outpacing what is tolerable. I think Toronto could tolerate  YOY when we consider local wages and economic growth.Yet again it is so hard to look at models and truly see what is going on when we see house prices but we dont ask what is a house? Is it a condo or a single detached? That  number is including single detached and there is absolutely  new supply now and forever of that product in Toronto and close to  in the GTA. outsideGTA communities are now building it rapidly. This supply shortage in singledetached is causing  increases in that market which is entirely sustainable because the demand for that product is easily substituted by a condominium home. The reason for this lack of supply in singledetached is largely the effect of protecting environmental lands like the green belt. Which I am all for but we in Toronto need to realize that there are costs to that...However we are still seeing  in the condo market which is outpacing what it should be.At these level I am shocked the city isnt introducing more tax measure  when the economy is hot we shouldnt be lending at . base rates federally across the board and offering huge tax deductions to real estate holders and buyers  we need to be raising real estate taxes to level price increases to maybe  and when prices start dropping from there then we reduce taxes.

10648653,0,t1_dddbnlw,Just because a business is old or famous doesnt mean it wont eventually close. Its not a big deal. Change is a part of culture. Get over it because shit is going to keep changing whether you like it or not. And that is okay. That is how new things happen. Youre going to get old and die. Things are going to continue changing. People will continue to find things they love and create things other people love. Either learn to find things you love create something for others to love or get out of the way.  Toronto is a city. Cities change. Culture requires change. Your nostalgia and nimbyism is irrelevant and is nothing but an obstacle to the very culture you claim to value so much.,toronto,ddebrgk,1,t5_2qi63

10692119,0,t1_ddioqbk,I think its true that very often peoples experiences of exclusion violence and systemic oppression make them more sensitive to suffering people with different experiences know. That empathy is limited though it can only be a kind of abstracted projection thats  always shaped by your own particular struggle. And it will omit important factors. When youre talking to someone with different experiences you really cant assume too much. Can a straight woman like me have a perfect understanding of what its like to be a gay man or vice versa? How much weight would you give my views of your life or the struggles youve faced?  How much insight could I really have into the structures that caused it of my own not just from what Ive read or heard? I could relate on some level since both of us have experienced the brunt of patriarchy  but that probably happened in different ways right? What could you tell me about what its like to deal with misogyny? If we were to have that kind of conversation about our lives and our understanding of them there would be moments when your maleness and my straightness would cause us each to miss important things. Experience is the best teacher is the thing.

10912800,0,t1_de5k31j,I live off of Bloor and actively avoid those bike lanes. They are far too narrow and have too many blind intersections. The parking design is terrible now we have to train passengers to look for cyclists the bollards are too easily bent  some protruding into traffic and some protruding into the bike lane.The only way to make this work is to make Bloor into one lane each way for traffic no left turns and remove the on street parking giving that space to widen the sidewalk and increase the width of the bike lane. Otherwise remove the physical separation it costs too much in precious roadway real estate... Id much prefer painted lines than bollards. The bollard work on Adelaide and Richmond because both are a one way and considerably wider.If the city insists on maintaining the current capacity for parking and cars while adding a very narrow bike lane as an after thought then it will never realize a vision for a connected and safe cycling network in this city.Route  barton and Harbord both run in parallel to the bloor lanes and are much safer. To add the the uselessness of the Bloor lane it also terminates eastwest the same as Route  and Hardbord so I have no idea what the city is trying to accomplish with Bloor but Im certain it will be counter productive.An extra . . minutes per each car is a hell of a lot of added pollution from idling vehicle way more than the offset of added cyclists.Edit Those arent really added cyclists... its not like those people just  bought a bike. Really theyve just migrated from either Harbord or Barton so its not more people riding bikes because of bloor lanes its simply more cyclists on Bloor. Edit Safe to assume there are new cyclists though not all new cyclists can be attributed to the bloor bike lane specifically they would have been a new cyclist anyway.Edit I live off of Shaw St. and used the Bloor lanes between there and Spadina im not familiar with the lanes east of Spadina so I dony mean to speak for the entire stretch of the bloor bike lane.,toronto,de5kt9s,35,t5_2qi63

You mentioned the Market. Kensington is one of the few places in the downtown core where I feel less constrained more like Im back in New York or in Europe. Theres a much more free anything goes atmosphere there. I dont know if this has anything to do with it but I was reading about Torontos history and it was basically run by the Orange Order for  years. There was comparatively little corruption but they rolled up the sidewalks at night LOL. They literally padlocked childrens swings on a Sunday. Very Protestant work ethic proper decent etc. But quite dull and conservative. Maybe some of that culture is still informing the character of the city and you either find it civilizing and a force for good or you react badly to its strictures.

Work is  hours you need to sleep for  hours which leaves you  hours to do everything else.  of those hours is spent travelling and say up to an hour for other work related things like getting ready in the morning and so forth.

From  to  she was executive director of the U of T Students Union or UTSU a student advocacy group that represents  members. In  she received around  in overtime and severance payments a sum that added up to about  per cent of the unions operating budget. In September of that year UTSU sued Hudson claiming she acquired the funds fraudulently. The suit alleges that Hudson filed for nearly  hours of overtime days after the election of a new government and that two outgoing executives conspired to approve the payout. These executives were initially named in the lawsuit but later settled with the union.Hudson they claimed had convinced them that shed received legal counsel from UTSUs lawyer and the payout had already been approved.gtHudson countersued the union for  in damages and in a statement of defence denies the allegation of civil fraud and says she was entitled to the money. She also states that during her time on the executive she was subject to inappropriate conduct and unwelcome comments by UTSU directors. Neither side will speak about the case which could take years to resolve. But a group of activists staged a sitin on Hudsons behalf last October stating that she had worked tirelessly on behalf of black students for years She experienced incredible levels of antiblack racism and misogynoir.

11016220,0,t3_5x7qyf,There are plenty of people myself included who agree with some basic concepts of ethics in comedy.  One commonly accepted rule is that ethical comedy punches up not down.  That institutions with power and people with privilege are acceptable targets.  Jokes which punch down which make fun of victims are disapproved of  and subsequently considered not funny.  Theres a long history of punching down jokes of making fun of oppressed and marginalized groups or of kicking people when they are at their lowest.  This type of humour still gets a lot of attention and support  so the concept of a punching up only rule is certainly not universally accepted.That said I think the disconnect here is that people who find the joke funny and acceptable see the joke as targeting suicide as a thing in and of itself and those who find it distasteful see it as a joke being made at the expense of people who commit suicide.  Its not a case where anyone who likes the joke is a sadist who enjoys it when other people suffer misfortune.  That there are people who see the joke as an ultimate act of punching up  no one likes suicide and we often feel powerless in preventing it from happening.  Its a dark and fatalist kind of humour  laughing at it because theres nothing else that can be done about it.The Beaverton defends itself by noting that they have been affected by suicide when they lost their founder.  This would explain why they see the joke as punching up  that they are targeting the senselessness of suicide and how powerless we all seem in trying to stop it.OTOH the actual joke itself is based entirely on ridiculing and belittling the imaginary person who commits suicide.  So I can certainly see how the joke could be considered in bad taste.  But in defense of the Beaverton this is their standard procedure  an absurdist approach often bordering on the surreal.  Also by portraying the person committing suicide so negatively they certainly cant be accused of glamorizing suicide.Im torn.  I accept that there are strong arguments for both condemning this joke as well as defending it.  Fortuantely for me though thats a TR train and Im much more likely to be on Line  than Line  so this joke doesnt really affect me at all.,toronto,degnoq1,6,t5_2qi63

11146862,0,t1_devf81j,I dont think you know what carding is if you think its black people not having IDs or somethingPolice carding racist antiblack and uselessgtCarding if youve somehow missed it is the police practice of arbitrarily stopping questioning and documenting a person  then entering their information into a database  to which young black men are disproportionately subjected.gtBy continuing the practice of carding in the absence of conclusive evidence of its efficacy in addressing crime the Toronto Police Service and the Toronto Police Services Board have clearly declared black communities a threat to the publics safety...We want to make clear that if this is the age of information as is so often declared then policy must be guided by clear evidence. In the case of carding there is no such evidence.Carding interactions are at best harassment and at worst can lead to violent unlawful assaultsarrests by cops on innocents such as when these young black children were arrested at gun pointgtThe boys all  and under were on their way to an afterschool learning program in a public housing complex on Neptune Dr. in Lawrence Heights when they were stopped by Lourenco and Const. Sharnal Pais.  It is alleged that when one of the boys attempted to exercise his right to walk away Lourenco threw punches and drew his gun. Backup police cruisers were called and all four boys were arrested and charged with assaulting police. The charges were later dropped.Unsurprisingly one of these brave cops has been caught not once but TWICE drunk driving once even with a taxpaid cop car.

Chinese Vietnamese Korean etc. You were told to not stand out to respect your private space and to not bring shame to your family... etc etc. Tradition Asian families care a lot about what other asian families think of them. Its insane. Even if were poor as fuck we gotta act like were rich when cousins come over. If hes twitch streaming probably family pressure or out of habit to hide his face to protect his family image. There is quite a posibility that he has self confidence issues because asians are not known to be attractive and he doesnt meet the standard of beauty dictated by society so a mask prevents him from getting judged.

Sure we have issues such as affirmative action or minority hiring that probably accounts for some people getting more than they should but in general I believe working hard and being smart are the biggest factors in success. Its the poor who think that someone else should pay for them and expect handouts. Complaining that its not working hard that results in having money and its the rich holding them down. Edit and I dont see a need to insult people when you dont agree with them. There are people who believe in working hard for what they want and need.

I would think that the board that approves those increases would look into those details though no?  Anyone else have anymore experience with getting these reversed?  I had a . increase last year initially they asked me to pay higher without having the final ruling from that board and I refused.

Poor whiteblack people in the USA  years ago commited crimes at same rate.  Middle and upper classes are all close.Biggest issue was proportionally many more black people are considered poor compared to other races so is it a race issue economic issue oppertunity issue.

City Council request the Director Equity Diversity and Human Rights in consultation with the City Manager the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Director Social Development Finance and Administration to gt.  develop an Intersectional GenderBased Framework with indicators that will help determine the impacts of City programs and services on various genders during the  Budget process with the goal of promoting an equitable effective and appropriate resource allocation to support gender equity and report to the October   meeting of City Council  on the progress of the framework indicators and an implementation plan gt. consult with experts in genderbased analysis and representatives from staff community agencies serving women including those with complex intersecting identities and genderdiverse members of equityseeking groups and vulnerable populations to review and advise on the development and implementation of the Intersectional GenderBased FrameworkIndex and  gt. work with City Divisions to develop a disaggregated data collection strategy for the City that will assist in among other things assessing the gendered impacts of City budgetary and policy decisions and report back to the November   meeting of the Executive Committee on the strategy and implementation plan.TBH I think the saddest thing about this whole mess is that the mayor had to pretend to support it at all.

11287861,0,t1_dfb2w7v,This might not be exact but I think it cover the basicsLets say the basic exemption is  you dont pay tax on the first  you earn and any tax you did pay is refunded.A lot most? students dont earn more than that in employment per year and scholarshipsgrants dont count normally towards taxable income.Unlike some credits e.g. GST credit which is paid to you even if you earned less than  a nonrefundable credit can offset taxes paid. So it will only lead to a refund on your taxes if you were earning above the basic exemption etc. and had owed taxes in that tax year.So if you were earning under the basic exemption listing on your tax return the public transit amounts paid that year shouldnt actually make a difference to the refund you get. But if you were earning over the exemption itll lead to a refund.,toronto,dfbgo4t,1,t5_2qi63

Your analysis shows there may be a likelihood that a lot of people who are buying are skewing prices due to a superstition. Fair enough but it doesnt tell us whether those buyers are Chinese Canadians whose roots date back to the CPR or whether those buyers are coming in with money from overseas.The danger of this is that it contributes to lumping an entire racial group of people together without analyzing other reasons for their skew eg  in X people in the GTA are racially Chinese to begin with.Instead of doing novel indirect analysis that implies potentially inflammatory and potentially incorrect results lets push for statistically significant data collection based on mandatory reporting.

11608487,0,t1_dgbnijv,Has nothing to do with that. F is the second most watched sport in the world at its not exactly easy to play either. The Leafs are economically inaccessible. Nav Bhatias fandom illustrates this perfectly. Nav was a recent immigrant to Canada when the Raptors were handed the franchise. He bought season tickets in the nosebleeds because he could afford it and as he became more successful over the years he upgraded his season tickets every year. You will never hear a story like that from a Leaf fan. The idea that a man can start from the nosebleeds and move down over the years with The Leafs is ludicrous. They also dont make nearly as much of an effort to reach out to the citys diverse population like the Raptors do. The Raptors have Asian themed half time shows for Lunar New Year. They have basketball camps for inner city youth. The NBA for a long time had to deal with the stigma of being a black league trying to appeal to a mostly white audience. They know they have to do certain things to appeal to different populations groups because theyve always had to struggle with this. When North America became more diverse they were well equipped to appeal to Asians Hispanics and others because they were used to this. The Raptors are a perfect example of this. The Utah Jazz another good example of this. Hockey is culturally white not saying this like its bad it just is and the one thing white people dont understand its that how to appeal to other populations. Again this isnt a bad thing it just is. There are more than enough white people in North America that you dont need to reach out to other ethnic groups. The NBA by contrast cannot survive entirely by just appealing to black people. Look at Nascar country music heavy metal and Quidditch  all things that are healthy and sustained by a mostly white demographic. Not saying that only white people enjoy those things or that they are mainstream just that you can be successful with a colourblind marketing philosophy of your perceived as white. Doesnt hold true if your perceived to be black or Asians or Hispanic etc. That said just about everybody in Jurassic Park probably had the Leafs as their second favourite team so its not necessarily an either or situation. Most Toronto sport fans love all their teams they just have preferences for number one.  ,toronto,dgbtypv,35,t5_2qi63

11631926,0,t1_dgbs5u7,I grew up loving hockey as a minority but few of my coloured friends shared that sentiment.  Those that enjoyed a sport usually enjoyed the NBA but even that was secondary to their affinity for hiphop culture.  My theory on this has always been that sports arent as idolized in some other cultures as they are in Western culture and that this alignment with mainstream hiphop culture helps the sport gain a lot of traction with fans who otherwise might be indifferent to basketball.Hockeys also a difficult sport to pick up and start watching.  It moves very fast even on television and can have dull moments with lots of icings and what not.  Basketball has some more complex rules but its easier to follow along with. Growing up I used to watch everything but hockey was always the most exciting game.  Ive grown out of basketball and can hardly stand to watch baseball anymore but hockey is as fastpaced and exciting as its ever been and is still my .  Its never computed to me how someone could watch enough hockey to learn and understand the game and not find it objectively superior to basketball football and baseball but we all have different tastes. ,toronto,dgehp54,4,t5_2qi63
