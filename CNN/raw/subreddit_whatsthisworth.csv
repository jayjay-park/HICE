If for example I have an item worth thousands of dollars and I purchased it from somebody I selfdescribed as being a crackhead it is going to be hard to argue that I had no reasonable suspicion that the items were stolen.  If I purchase an item with a reasonable suspicion that it is stolen then it doesnt matter whether I bring it to the attention of the police the fact is that I have committed a crime.

Beautiful frame that if I could get a better look at and see if the glass is wavy construction etc.But for the contents Id concur with the other persons estimation of ish seems a touch high to me but linens are a hard market to find that right buyer.

10213994,0,t1_dc1skhs,I have no clue what its worth thats why I came here. And of course I wish it was super rare and worth a bunch of money but Im being realistic. I know this wasnt a high end model and I know its not rare. His comment bothered me because its at least worth more than the cost of its weight in metal. I have no interest in selling but a few friends have been asking me the value so I was interested. I would be happy with a couple hundred if I decide to sell. Any way I appreciate all of the comments! Also I was told by some older guys I work with that used these old things and read online somewhere again I have no experience in using a modern gas stove or an older one that they are just as efficient if not better than the new ones. Side note Where are you guys from that Walmart sells ovens?? lol Im from the Midwest we dont have a Walmart like that! It would be nice but around here you have to go to sears or another appliance store.,whatsthisworth,dc1tbdm,1,t5_2sslp

10252834,0,t1_dc67ig2,Yeah Im going to go ahead and say that a family engraved it when it was purchased. Ive seen cuffs before with a list of names of children that bought a piece for their dad or someone writing all their familys names in a piece they wore daily.Rest stays the same typical late  to mid s Navajo made piece average price would be around  depending on sizecondition. Impossible to know specifically who made it and thousands of silversmiths worked making pieces like that for the booming tourist trade and popularity of turquoise of that particular era. ,whatsthisworth,dc67r1c,3,t5_2sslp

11128729,0,t1_detade8,About six or seven years ago my sister bought an old steamer trunk at a farm auction. When she opened it she found it was full of knickers bloomers bonnets etc... I never saw any of it but she described it as old prairie clothing. The stuff was probably at least a hundred years old.  Well she only wanted the steamer trunk so she gave the clothes to her friend. By the time she told me about it it was too late to ask for any of it back. I wanted to strangle her.,whatsthisworth,detfjys,7,t5_2sslp
11197682,0,t1_df11xrp,The problem with the sidebarfaqsticky is that subscribers see those casual visitors first timers and mobile users dont see them or are so amped that they post firstread later. Its a  fix at most IMO. In spite of the fact that a cork borer sharpener is in the logo for the sub  we still see them.

11249335,0,t3_60jqve,Interesting find.Clothing is one of the hardest things to price. I could easily see this selling in a highend vintage shop for over  if authentic and in good condition. But its much harder for you as a random person to sell that and dont expect to get anywhere close to that if selling to a store. Its an unusual item that could sell for a lot to the right buyer but will be hard to move.,whatsthisworth,df73gc6,7,t5_2sslp
