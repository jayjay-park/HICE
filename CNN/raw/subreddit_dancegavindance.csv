In general I love the album I think Tilian does a great job on Times New Roman as well as all of Kurts tracks but I feel Jonny is still the best person at singing his songs.

9629216,0,t1_d9zktn1,definitely a well thought out read. My question is do you expect these divisive and polarizing records from theses bands? Do you welcome the change as a fan? If yeah the there you go. You have proved me wrong albiet a generalized statement proved wrong none the less. I go through dgds discography almost daily seriously cant get sick of this band but Id say when each vocalist change happens chronologically I feel the sound is drastically different. Tillians been a safe bet the last two released and I was honestly arguing a moot point considering Id love change I doubt they can realistically put out an album Id hate haha. ,dancegavindance,d9zzyrl,1,t5_2t7vk

11591367,0,t3_65fr3f,It would be hard for Jon to adapt his contributions to an acoustic setting I think. Spoken word would be kinda strange. The instrumentals would be beautiful though.

11715054,0,t1_dgnwfjx,Im sorry it was a let down from your expectations.Though if I could Id like to say that Strings horns and different orchestral arrangements while subtle and not like a symphonic movement make this band incredibly unique. Maybe  other bands do this with this type of production and most are disbanded now.I hardly see whats generic about it they dont sound like pop rock PHC and they dont sound like risecore circa . Its interesting considering so many people are saying I was hoping for some sort of incredible climax but it never happens or It builds up to nothing I was expecting more This is a good thing subverting expectations and delivering something unexpected but not inherently bad is a great thing to do in any artistic medium. If you could guess everything about how a something will be you lose that surprise factor and nothing wows you anymore you become stagnant. But this is of course just my opinion as a person on the internet haha.Maybe Im too optimistic and forgiving though. I can see how this would feel like a betrayal to a lot of people just wish it wasnt like that you know?,dancegavindance,dgnxicj,2,t5_2t7vk
