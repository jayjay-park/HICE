47772,0,t1_cejui6l,Well in that case I think you should try NoFap in conjunction with other techniques to center yourself and discover who you really are.This quest is much more about self discovery and a sense of self worth than it is NoFap its just that most of us on here had NoFap as the core of our problem.If I were you Id focus on eating three healthy meals a day working out regularly and removing anything from your life that could detract from you being your truest self including not being fully authentic.From your description it actually sounds like your primary escape is weed and video games whereas mine was PMO.  Use the same techniques for escaping from either coping mechanism.I personally enjoy weed in social situations once in a while  but I make sure its not the couchlock kind.  I dated a girl once who was a daily smoker and nonstop and she claimed she was addicted to it and that it totally demotivated her.  Once she stopped smoking regularly she started up her own business and is thriving now.  Ive not personally experienced anything negative from weed but anything is possible based on your own brain chemistry.,NoFap,cejvat0,1,t5_2skrn

Exercise meditation yoga going for long walks reading prayer for those who are into it music dancing... those are the kind of things that people need to add to their lives if they plan on quitting masturbation.

58344,0,t1_cel21et,Fatty foods probably kills more than alcohol but both can be consumed normally. I have not yet seen a natural reason to watch porn. Its highly addicting and serves no beneficial purpose to the individual or humanity as a whole. Id argue that everyone involved may say theyre happy but many have come out years later and admitted how disgusted they were the entire time.

63244,0,t1_cellna1,I am nowhere near qualified to define this but I will explain it as I understand. Dopamine is a chemical that serves a good purpose. It is in the reward center of our brains the animalistic simple inner brain  that drives us to seek food mate enjoy television videogames etc. When you look at porn you are tricking you inner brain. It thinks you are really mating with these women. Since they are the most attractive fit ample mates exaggerated physical features they make you pump out more dopamine. Mates off the screen cant compete and the viewer is less likely to pursue a real mate because they have unlimited false mates online and elsewhere. There is nothing wrong with masturbation. It is a natural normal thing. But using porn is not. Neither is masturbating everyday or all day for that matter. Guilty as charged! You are wise to have at least looked into nofap and to give it a shot. By controlling your sexually urges you will be able to put that energy to use elsewhere in your life like school work hobbies and developing rewarding friendships and relationships.I speak as someone who is a  year old female who discoversd NoFap a year and a half ago. I had been covering the traumas of my childhood with PMO since a very young age. I am now  days porn free used to watch it all day some days and have only MOd  times in the last  days. My life has improved in so many ways and it is my wish that everyone who was in my boat someday finds the way to reverse PMOs dark grip on life. You have discovered it at a very important time of your life. Soon you will have higher education and employment to deal with. You are still a kid but these next years will be very important in the development of your path to adulthood. Dont let porn get its grip on you theres so much more out there thats important.Best of luck! ,NoFap,celmovr,3,t5_2skrn

Being a man was never based upon seducing and getting X amount of women in the sac. Back before if you boasted of this youd be seen as a perverted weirdo. This is what the hypersexualisation of our society has done. It has set unrealistic expectations if you dont have sex at  youre not cool If youre not picking up so many different girls youre inferior if you dont have a oversized D and cant last two hours youre a loser. How sad that being authentic having true integrity being a gentleman pursuing a great career setting noble goals living humble saving something special for someone worthwhile learning etc. These were the fruits of a true man. Not how good or long he can last in bed. This just shows how low the bar has been set this is the pitiful downfall of our society..,NoFap,ceoaqs1,1,t5_2skrn

After all striving and desires coming out of various factors like experience emotion personality etc are the only things that can change humans. The unexplainable striving of probably many men and theirselves  caused some people to say enough!! and as a result of them taking actions and building a idea into a passionproject  thousands of people now find this reddit and positively change their lives and thereby the world. It was caused by a longing personally I actually think a longing of more people who wanted it subcounsiously but one leader who decided to take action. The world was ready for it.That aside what i really wanted to say was that I know you will definitely be allright because for real  you say experimenting and i love it!! Exactly agree  cause experimenting being vacant for experiences in life with a unprejudiced look  is a golden mindset. It is even way more important than nofap..... or anything in life.I still stand behind my reaction..... but it was probably not for youwhat i described in the reaction. Your decision is very consious and thaughtout maybe not exactly logical to others but for you it is probably distinct and you know precisely where you are going. And thats why I feel ya  I also do things and have toughts that are notlogical to some people society  and for them they would likely think why? i cant follow the stepsthoughts. But for me it is distinct and when feel i like im doing good I step on the path that is considered good in my convictions and thoughtprocesses  NOONE can stop me.My reaction to your post was just a reflection of thinking patterns with which I expected a general personality in combination by the words you typed in the OP for me to categorize you in a subcounsious process ya know.Maybe my post was for someone else always also a part for yourself opinionbuilding and I just love to put my thoughts on paper.

125680,0,t1_cesprod,What you are saying is true but youre missing the big picture If a guy is using PUA terminology then its fairly logical to assume that hes been somewhat unsuccessful with women in the past. If that wasnt the case then why would he have gone through all the trouble to learn the lingotacticswhatever.If this is the case chances are they have a significant amount of their self esteem caught up in the act of getting acknowledgement attention and sexual response from women. This is all based upon the limiting belief that they need to have attention from women in order to be whole confident and have the ability to truly like themselves. If this werent true then getting this attention wouldnt be such a big deal.As long as they are operating from this mindset their fulfillment is wrapped in eliciting a specific response from women who look a specific way. So at that point the women literally become objects that need to be manipulated so that the person can feel good about themselves.The problem is that this approach isnt ultimately fulfilling because they arent operating as whole people but rather as someone with a certain void within themselves who needs external validation to be whole. Additionally it doesnt lend itself to a healthy relationship on either side.Some people can understand this outright but I believe that many people need to actually experience the truth to understand. They spend their whole lives being told that getting sexual attention from women is what is going to make them a real man and bring them fulfillment so no one is going to tell them otherwise.The thing is hooking up with women is extremely easy once you have the confidence. Seriously its not hard at all however for someone who finds it difficult it can seem like the solution to all their problems. But once you realize you can find someone to get laid with whenever you want and start doing it you see that its not really all its cracked up to be. Its shallow and unfulfilling. So when I see a post like the OP is referencing I feel happy that the person whos getting attention feels happy amp is gaining confidence but I also have sympathy for what they are going to go through as they move forward. They think they just found the key to life but I know that there is an inevitably painful process in front of them where they realize that getting women doesnt bring fulfillment. At that point they go through the uncomfortable process of shifting their worldview and behaviors again or they become lost in the emptiness of shallow physical relationships in the same way they were once lost in porn.,NoFap,cesqrm3,29,t5_2skrn

129479,0,t1_cet0yh3,Yeah thus far Im on hard mode. Honestly I wish that I had the whole going crazy thing going on. Im still a little worried that feeling intense attraction like a lot of people here talk about isnt going to kick in for me. Right now my dick doesnt seem to give a fuck about women that I look attalk towhatever. I spent years waking it up whenever I wanted to masturbate. So it only seems to respond to that now. Im hoping that Ill regain the ability to get hard without the stimulation of directly touching it. Thats part of the reason that I slipped a bit yesterday. I was irrationally worried that it wasnt working because I hadnt even gotten morning wood in more than a week and it didnt respond at all when I was chatting with a cute girl. Then once I got it hard assuring myself that it could at least still function I noticed the tremendously increased sensitivity and couldnt help but try out the new sensation a bit. Lucky I was able to convince myself that I shouldnt do it before I got very far with it. ,NoFap,cet6cyh,1,t5_2skrn

155911,0,t3_1vulxw,At first I was leaning on the side of the pheromones being what causes increased attraction but now Im fairly sure its the body language  eye contact. Ive been having regular sex with my GF and still getting tons of lookssmiles. I figure the pheromones get released through sex the same way as if you were to fap so it must be the latter. Im pretty sure it doesnt have much to do with looks either because where this is happening is up at a ski resort and we have to bundle up with big ugly green suits that I look dumb in and still getting attn...I just tried  separate times to write why I think the increased attn is because porn makes you at least subconsciously think your a perv and thats why you dont send off signals. I dont know I kept contradicting myself with other reasons for it. But really I dont even necessarily care if I hookup with another girl I got my GF I wouldnt cheat on her anyways its just so nice to feel connected with women like accepted.I even find myself giving nods and smiles to some that I dont find attractive or even older ladies. It just makes me feel really good I feel like I know them even though Ive never said a word. Obviously it feels rly good when a hottie gives u a nod but still its just nice to connect with anyeveryone...Also what Ive noticed is sometimes girls get a HUGE smile like with teeth showing and everything. I think its like since I looked at them in the eye they were shocked. Like the guys I work with dont look at them till they walk by and then rate them based on their ass and hair but dont look at them while theyre actually paying attn. Maybe so many guys are doing this that the girl thinks shes not even getting any attn and seeing someone give them acknowledgement is surprising and maybe they were thinking jeez do none of these guys think Im attractive? The whole subject is great Im having a good day lol. ,NoFap,cew6uao,3,t5_2skrn

157762,0,t3_1vw7r7,Wow a little more than  minute? Do you think its because its heightened sensitivity as a result of NoFap? I know someone who used to ejaculate right after penetrating which to me is premature. However imo I think the reason as to why you could control your masturbation vs intercourse is because its your dick in your hand. You have control and you know the sensitivity level. If you have sex the feelings and emotions are completely different. If your brain is properly wired and you dont have any medical conditions you should have no problem getting it up and have sex with your partner. gtbut still is the short time normalAs for designated times I would say that every guy is different and you shouldnt look at standard times.

Cold showers. Go out. See a movie go to the library go to the park. Hang with friends. Visit a MuseumArt Gallery if youre into that. Sporting events. Concerts. Talk to strangers. Meet people. You have nothing to lose. Do things that are enjoyable that will take your mind off of your situation and that will promote a sense well beinghappiness.Another thing that works for me if I cant get out of the house for whatever reason. I like to just lay or sit down. Close my eyes and just let myself feel whatever I am feeling. Stop fighting it accept it. Let in let the feeling wash over you. Pray or talk to God if you are religious. Understand that this is your mind body and spirit changing. Its hard but it will not kill you. Let it in. Let it strengthen you. This is the path to recovery. This is the path to being the person you were meant to be.After a while the feeling goes away and I feel better. I also feel good that I can overcome the discomfort and I feel like I will be able to handle whatever discomfort is in store for me. I feel in control.You will get over this.

It always helps to keep your mind and body healthy day in and out so you dont supplement yourself with unhealthy habits. Meditation is a good one not sure which kind youre into but the kind Im more geared toward is the closed source meditations in that they serve to train your tolerance to distractions urges. Definitely stay fit in some way or another a slouch will be a slouch. Most importantly focus on your life.

231451,0,t3_1wrkiz,Speaking from the perspective of a  year old Youre still very young and sitting on tremendous energy and opportunity. When I was in college I didnt have perspective on how much freedom and energy I had. Its hard to control your thoughts I know but I recommend as much as possible to not waste your time with regret and just appreciate what youve got and look forward. If you have a spiritual path its really good to draw on that for strength e.g. prayer and meditation. Ask whatever power you believe in in the universe to remove that feeling and guide you towards the next right action. Congratulations on caring about your life and giving enough of a damn to try to get better with NoFap and asking for help with it. For me I had to get my ass kicked pretty hard before I was willing to get some help.Hope this is helpful and that you feel better.,NoFap,cf4qkur,3,t5_2skrn

Thats what got me all wrapped up when I was in highschool I over thought everything and made it super complicated. then when it came time to act I had soooo much internal energy invested in it that I thought it was this huge deal. Its not... Something as simple as hey the more weve gotten to know each other the more I realize just how unique and special of a girl you are Id probably regret it years from now if i didnt at least ask you out on one official date. If nothing comes of it then its cool we can go back to the way it was before whatcha say?Worse comes to worse she says Im sorry i dont see you that way. Then respond Its cool no worries Im just glad to have gotten it off my chest.. Seriously man thats all it takes its like a  min conversation lol.Otherwise youll end up waiting till something happens or there is the right time and itll never come or when it does youve blown it into such a big deal that you will have massive anxiety over holding her hand or kissing her and itll suck big time.GL mate!,NoFap,cf4sc0p,1,t5_2skrn

249999,0,t3_1wz022,It sounds like youre in a stressful time in your relationship with your girlfriend and maybe your life in general.  This is something worth reflecting on both as a motivation for continuing PMO and to ask yourself if PMO contributed to the situation.Also remember that there are guys who manage to do this hardmode for months and possibly even years.Honestly despite the fact that I dont really know your situation that well Id say it sounds like time to call it quits on your current relationship.  It doesnt sound very satisfying to either of you.  End it and use it as an opportunity to work on yourself and your own life without unnecessary distractions. ,NoFap,cf6o07k,1,t5_2skrn

265941,0,t3_1x5f57,Hey man so sorry to hear about the relapse but allow me to slap you with some outside perspective. Right now you are in an emotional tailspin. You fapped broke your streak felt the disappointment. The disappointment in yourself leads to justification for further relapse I mean hey I failed yesterday. What am I losing? A  hour streak?It seems simple right? But when youre in the front seat of this emotional roller coaster everyday you justify it by yesterdays failure and then  minutes later you feel like dirt and swear youll never do it again. So heres where I give you the roadmap Ive been on this ride before. Tomorrow guess what youre going to feel the urges and immediately start to justify exactly why its cool for you to fap tonight and start your streak tomorrow. Recognize it and deal with it. Contemplate why you started nofap in the first place. Come to rnofap if it helps you. Understand that you will feel the exact same thing the next day and it wont stop. Thats the hard bit ready for the good news? You havent lost anything. You feel like youve lost a lot of the benefits youve gained within those past  days... but theyre all still there. Youre just in the tailspin right now and cant see it. Refocus regroup and by the time your badge says  days youll feel like youre on day  again. ,NoFap,cf8bp7y,2,t5_2skrn

All other people can do is tell you the benefits and give you tips and tricks on how to cope with the addiction. But these benefits dont mean jack shit to people with no life purpose. You have to find something worthy you want to do with your life if youre gonna be successful at this. Otherwise its just a challange you will see the benefits but when you compare it with porn the leverage is gonna go with porn.PS The benefits are countless you can start with reading this and you dont really need to doubt its validity.

Your doing this at a pretty young age kudos for you bc your urges are probably even stronger bc of hormones. Your an athlete too its good to see athletes on here trying to make themselves better in all aspects of life. Especially since Masculine culture seems to almost propagate the degradation of female power and encourage male dominance. Thus making porn viewing a less shameful action by male standards. I  believe biologically most woman are attracted to dominant men. Thus us athletes tend to have higher chances with woman. But ironically watching porn seems to make the male consumer less dominant in real life whilst perpetuating female inferiority in a cultural sense. Kind of a double negative. Im trying to be come a dominant alpha male not in the sense of superiority over females or over others but in the context of being an admirable role model and leader for the community.

315093,0,t1_cfdf48y,I dont want to get to much into detail that might be contraproductive. Lets just say some guys me or my friends have been with intended to do rather weird stuff without even asking whether the partner might like it or very uncomfortable positions that they couldnt manage to keep because they clearly learned them by seeing not by doing. Oh and the worst thing was shaming me for not screaming or getting off just from penetration immediately. Of course I didnt pretend to like something that doesnt do anything to me. When girls fake orgasms they steal themselves the possibility of having a real one because the guy thinks he did it right and doesnt change his shitty technique.,NoFap,cfdffum,10,t5_2skrn

316744,0,t3_1xq35s,Meh. What Ive done is masturbated as much as Ive wanted without feeling guilty about it until I was truly motivated to do nofap again. Look I love masturbating to orgasm. Im good at it. I can do it for hours and then have an absolutely stupendous ejaculation  and feel great about it afterwards. But it comes with a price. Theres an opportunity cost in terms of all the things I could have done with my time. Theres an unwillingness to be accommodating to a potential partner because I can meet my own sexual needs far better than they can while my emotional needs remain starving. Theres the fact Im suffusing my brain with chemicals which is self medicating me in unhealthy ways in many respects because it requires so little creative or productive effort on my part. And of course theres the lifelong experience of my dick not working right when Im with someone. But this shit is hard. Especially at the beginning. If Im not ready to do it I dont force myself into a half hearted effort because thats just setting myself up for failure. You have to really want to do this shit. REALLY want to do this shit. So that when your skin is on fire and the only relief is to whack one off real quick you have the fortitude to say No!It really does get to be less urgent after a while. It doesnt make the no fap challenge easier necessarily but it does make it less intense on a continuous basis. It makes the challenge more a matter of being vigilant about the urges and less about combatting ridiculous withdrawal symptoms. You just havent gotten to that point yet. Usually it takes me about two weeks and this is my third attempt which has gone on past that mark. Just dont beat yourself up so much so to speak. Youre not some kind of failure. The timing just hasnt been right so far. You need to get fired up to do this thing and quit going in part way. You made it through several days. You need to go a little bit linger than that. Just get through that first part. Then you can move on to the next stage  which is its own kind of challenge. ,NoFap,cfdlllo,1,t5_2skrn
317547,0,t1_cfdhqhs,This is true and needs to be pointed out more often. Women need to know this.. and that is why I included it in my HuffPost blog on Porn addiction Myths. From my postMisconception   Guys who claim they have porninduced ED are just not attracted to their partner.Many guys on porn recovery forums say they are extremely attracted to their partners and find it very confusing that they cannot get aroused. I was one of those guys. I had a beautiful girl who I found very attractive yet I could not physically feel any arousal when going for sex. Why is this important? The partner may feel she is not attractive enough or cant compare to the porn stars. It is very important to let these heartbroken girls know that it is not always an attraction thing but rather a brainwiring thing. If a guy has wired his sexual arousal to a screen and porn it does not matter how sexy or attractive he finds his partner... he may not be able to get it up. Once I made it clear to my girlfriend that she was very attractive but my brain had just been numbed and wired for porn it helped her feel a lot better about waiting and less devastated when Mr. Happy looked sad.,NoFap,cfdolc4,27,t5_2skrn

One would have to use his or her best judgement on this and tread very carefully.Theres one other thing Id add regarding approach if someone decided this was the right thing to do. Theres something powerful almost magical in approaching people about difficult things when its done with absolutely no ulterior motives no selfishness with unconditional love. In general in all interactions in my life when I can get to this point in my own mind and heart conversations especially difficult ones are much more beautiful and meaningful. It doesnt always work for sure since we cant control anyones reaction to us.

I would play video games until I could barely keep my eyes open then I would go to bed. This worked but I quickly developed other problems such as fatigue. I search for new ways to avoid it. For example I try to stay out of my house I live alone for as long as possible. Ill stay out with my girlfriend until late at night to avoid being alone. I also work a nd job where u usually get off at  or  which helps. Thanks again for the reply!,NoFap,cfgyizf,1,t5_2skrn

354865,0,t1_cfhchvc,This is a great response! A lot to work with.I am familiar with thunderfoot he is a great warrior against irrationality in todays society.gt Apparently showing evidence that contradicts what you say must mean I am arguing for the opposite position.But you never linked the study please link the study with author institution and publishing date info available. Furthermore the evidence you presented was for masturbation in general. The topic here is internet porn addiction as I said previously. Some here allow masturbation with no porn which just shows how varied individual challenges can be made what Ive been trying to tell you. NoFap isnt one size fits all as you keep implying. gt I did look at those and they didnt seem to really demonstrate anything other than diminishing returns exist. Explain what you mean here. I showed you the studies and you simply say still not enough to convince me? Or do you mean that there is clearly no serious deleterious effect? How can you so confidently say that in light of the Italian study ? And are you also denying well studiedestablished concepts like the coolidge effect and novelty on the brain which I also linked to?gt Sure you can become addicted to porn as you can get addicted to anything. My problem with this sub is that it takes no scale to see are they addicted how many times do your masturbate daily? etc and just takes the stand of ITS BAD DONT DO IT THE GOAL IS NONE AT ALLAgain thats where youre wrong. All this subreddit is is a challenge. A challenge to see if you can for a period of time abstain from Masturbation porn orgasm sex or any combination of these. There is NO one size fits all. No where is it said its all BAD!!!. However IF someone is coming to this site with relationships falling apart massive time being lost or escalation to extremedisturbing types of fetishes due to internet porn and they WANT to quit would you so casually recommend they continue usage?You readily admit that anything can become addictive so if someone has a problem with it and WANTS to quit and feels that this subreddit can help then we should be encouraging them to continue abstaining no?. No where on NoFap is it officially said porn so baaad eeevil!. Sure some posts on the site say that but VERY often I see counterother popular posts arguing that internet porn is NOT necessarily bad the way alcohol isnt necessarily bad but for an alcoholic it simply must be stayed away from. People are here for different reasons its not a hive mind as you suggest.I would change what I said to OP though. I should have first asked if porn has been a problem for him AND asked what his reasonsgoals are for being here at NoFap. Indeed maybe keeping the pic could have been fine for him! But if he said something like Im doing this challenge because Im failing classes due to skipping them in favor of internet porn then I would have told him the same thing what would you have him do?But back to the main points!. Not neutral? Okay. I personally see no problem with masturbation as well but because I DO have a porn addiction problem lots of time lose relationship strains I am abstaining from that as part of my challenge again this is my individual goal. I understand the Null hypothesis better now though I still feel you werent neutral to begin with so thanks for the clarification. I can see how positive vs positive would butt heads as we sorta are now.. Again there is no one attitude towards porn. Just a desire to cut it down or get rid of it all together. PLEASE pm me when you post your videos Im interested! and let me know when you make your thread here. I always encourage debate it prevents information bubbles from forming. Just dont title it something super divisive. If you want to get your points out there with fewer downvotes stay polite.. You can agree that if every male had smoked cigarettes since age  we might think lung cancer is normal in young men right? Wed also be missing a control group. That is the situation with internet porn. Might it be like watching TV? Sure! But you can have an addictiveunhealthy relationship with watching TV as well. Hell I want a study on THOSE people too! But COULD it be demonstrably harmful? With the few studies we have including  there is a compelling yet incomplete argument that it could be for SOME people I highly doubt it for all or even most.Again explain the diminishing returns.. Thanks for clarifying your position on that!. Thanks for watching it.gt The major problem I have with Gary Wilson is that this is what he doesgt . States somethinggt . Shows study demonstrating thinggt . Builds step in logical chaingt . Adds on flawed logical chain.Ah so here is the juicy stuff!Lets be crystal clear. Gary is NOT making any definitive conclusions. What he presents is more a hypothesis explaining the phenomena suggested by the results of research like . Remember these things HAVE actually been studied . ED in young men never seen before. reduced sexual performance due to internet porn. potential addictiveness of internet browsing due to novelty generally. when first exposure to porn happens on average. coolidge effect less arousal with same mate more with novel mates.He uses these to build his hypothesis.He even concludes the Ted talk by saying we need the study to be attempted again perhaps using men in communities like NoFap as control not as perfect as a control group of men who NEVER PMOd but its as close as we may get in .So again I feel the creationist comparison ouch again is not accurate. Definitive conclusions arent being made. And as soon as a good study comes out showing that internet porn is not harmful or at the very least has no effect on the brain Ill be the first to post here!gt Adds on flawed logical chain.What specific step is the flawed step? No definitive conclusion is made again more of a hypothesis constructed with the help of ACTUAL studies results. A creationisttheist has made up their mind beforehand and goes out to look for evidence to sortakinda support their claim while ignoring the plethora of evidence that contradicts it. That is simply not the case here. The comparison is simply not accurate.Furthermore Garys claim is falsifiable whereas a theists claims are not. We WILL find that control group and make this studys happen and we WILL have a preliminary assessment of the specific question in mind which again is Can internet porn with masturbationorgasm be physically addictive? That is can it drastically alterchange the brain and its neural chemical pathways in ways typically associated with physical addictions eg. physical dependence etc.? So the comparison just doesnt fit. I hate to sound like a broken record but I feel it is inadequate trust me Ive had my fair share of debates with creationiststheists online and offline. Especially with my own family members.So if.  This subreddit in fact makes NO moral argument foragainst internet porn seriously this is like the th or th time Im saying this. It is simply a support community for people who want to abstain from porn with masturbationorgasm PMO for personal reasons. Even then its official wiki lists caveat after caveat after caveat. One of the mantras is YMMV Your mileage may vary! This site NEVER claims to be a cure all for anything. So just a support site. and.... Internet porn CAN be addictive even if just for now behaviorally. and.... Some people ARE having serious issues with it leading them here Well encourage them to stay off it and give them tips to avoid relapsing.Then do you still have a problem with it?I definitely want to thank you for continuing to debate me. You have helped are helping me solidify my own thoughts on all of this. I am once again reminded of the incomplete data on PMO. This is why debate should be encouraged more often!Again let me know when you finish your debunking videos.I look forward to your next response!,NoFap,cfhjr7j,2,t5_2skrn

441512,0,t1_cfqij23,Some advice on condoms. Before I go into it realize Ive never come inside a woman with a condom on  but fuck Ive never come inside a woman period for the last  years so whatever.One of the reasons I know the  days was helpful is because by dick was MUCH MUCH more sensitive to masturbation during my binges. My orgasms were consistently fucking amazing.Also I was able to come inside a condom during masturbation. The condom brand I used was Kimono. Theres several different kinds on Amazon. In Britain and Europe theres a brand thats customized to your penis Im not kidding. Its not available in North America though. If youre in that part of the world Id be glad to find the link.Use lubrication on your dick before you put the condom on. Use a water based lubrication oil based lubrication will break down the latex  not good!. For a variety of reasons this increases the sensation when youre inside your partner.Losing an erection or not being able to gain one is incredibly emasculating. Its also a vicious circle. The more you buy into those feelings the worse it gets. Its so important to relax...but easier said than done as you know.The key thing that is clear to me is that you pick understanding partners. You must have some really good qualities in different ways because you earn those kinds of partners. Theyre being understanding and sensitive towards you because they feel like you deserve it and they want to help. That was true of your last girlfriend and its true of your current one. Or at least it seems to be based on what youve written.You need to respect that appreciate it and not shit all over it by feeling sorry for yourself or inadequate in different ways because youre not maintaining an erection.Something Id like for you to do. Research karezza. Thats sex that emphasizes touching and intimacy over orgasm. It will help you bond with your current girlfriend without feeling the pressure of needing to ejaculate or even get and maintain an impressive erection.As you relax and become attuned to the sensuality between you and your girlfriend its my opinion the erections are going to come naturally. Youre not going to be focused on it. Also youll be more willing to let your erections come and go without caring whether youve ejaculated already while having confidence they will return. Or if an erection doesnt return its no big deal because thats not the end goal in the first place. Intimacy and bonding is.I also think performing oral sex on my partner is important but ironically my current partner isnt as turned on or comfortable with that as Id prefer. Shell let me do it but its not something she demands and I have to kind of seduce her to get her to allow me to although she enjoys it well enough once I get there.Just concentrate on the physical intimacy without needing to achieve an orgasm to feel like its served a purpose. That will go a long way in helping you heal.Understand I say all that but believe me I want to achieve a fucking orgasm with my current partner. I have confidence and faith it will happen some day but thats a far cry from being able to say its already happened so any advice Im giving should be taken within that context.Thanks for the questions. I really admire you. I think youre doing a lot of good. Im especially impressed with the very little youve relayed about both of your partners. It says a lot about you by reflection.,NoFap,cfqizxr,2,t5_2skrn

You may want to remember that the tension and desire we feel from urges is a RESULT of resistance. Through nonresistance we work in HARMONY with our energy  It flows freely in our bodies and only longs to be EXPRESSED!!! However it needs not be expressed through a selfindulgent cycle of stimulation and depression. We can express it through art music sharing a good laugh or getting that work done! This energy is FELT inspiration!! Through nonresistance you will find yourself comfortable with where you are. You dont need to release because you are not RESISTING the feeling in your body. Capisce? This puts you in a position of power. Choice. What will you do with this energy? Build a six pack? Help the poor and hungry? Sculpt a masterpiece?

Im not saying everyone should get high just that the criminal system is the wrong system to deal with the problem. It should be the medical system. My opinion.To put in a more selfish context do you think it is appropriate for you and I as taxpayers to be charged over a million dollars to jail a guy for  years for a simple sale of some processed plant matter?

481981,1,t3_1zly58,Although I do not believe that there is anything wrong with being gay I believe that committing homosexual acts is a sin. I know that this is an unpopular opinion so I am going to present proof straight from the bible to back up my pointsSodomGomorrah were doomed because the majority of their population were gay. Genesis   gtBefore they lay down the men of the city the men of Sodom surrounded the house both young and old all the people bfrom every quarter  and they called to Lot and said to him Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may chave relations with them.Leviticus gtDo not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman that is detestable. Corinthians gtOr do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with menTo restate I do not believe that being gay is wrong. I DO believe that acting on those urges is wrong just like wanting to watch porn is not bad in and of itself but succumbing to those urges is. However I have to take offense at your statement that God can bless same sex relationships. How can God the holy ruler bless something abhorrent and mired in sin?,NoFap,cfv1yuz,-1,t5_2skrn

515199,0,t3_2014ju,Im the same exact way. The past month or so Ive reall been lonely and wishing for a girl in my life. Ive prayed about it and stuff and I know things will come as they will and you shouldnt rush anything  Thinking about this has changed my perspective greatly. I found that this loneliness was incredibly well selfish. What I wanted was to be able to walk around with an attractive girl in arm and maybe show her off a bit. To feel the sensation of kissing again the physical contact and to be constantly flirting. It was just so... Self seeking. So after the praying and thinking Ive been reversing a lot of my previous attitudes. Rejecting things like physical contact and instead wanting to be there for a girl in the ups and downs to hold her when shes sad to protect her when shes in a rough spot to celebrate with her in the happy times. I know the aforementioned physical touches will come anyways if I do this.Still working on it though. Youll notice my one day badge. That relapse is trying to set my brain back to wanting mere physical closeness. And I know that a girl might not just show up when I better myself and I shouldnt think of that as a failed attempt. I ought to do this to better myself and treat womenas daughters of God which is a saying even atheists can begin to understand. Hope this gives a second viewpoint.

529581,0,t3_207caq,Yes. We should view the women we meet and talk to as just normal people not potential sex objects. Talk to them as friends. Porn causes two types of guys it turns already shy guys into absolute losers. And it turns naturally extroverted guys into guys who pursue meaningless sex all the time and never become intimate with a woman. In either case they arent approaching women as just regular people. The encounter becomes too sexually charged and either  too scary to deal with if youre shy or  too useless seeming to you. And both results cause avoidance. ,NoFap,cg0gxzg,9,t5_2skrn

As you can tell by my day badge I occasionally take a break from nofap but Ive taken the challenge on quite a few separate occasions. In general there is something very empowering for me to be able to deny myself sexual gratification. Not only do I find myself able to channel my sexual energy into other areas of my life but just the mere act of selfdenial seems to improve my mood increase my selfesteem and make sex with women much more enjoyable.

I was raised by a soldier.  Now I have no idea how to be a civilian. or a soldier. or anything. Because in my house it was in a combat zone you would fucking die do it right you little shit.  Now Im a disciplined masochistic miserable human being with borderline that cant relax make friends socialize or live a life without daily thoughts of suicide.  I struggle daily with this because I often see no reason why I should keep going with nofap because in my mind my lifes always been fucked and always will be.  And I can tell you that hard ass comments do nothing but give me another hour of fighting through suicide and depression.    So just think about the others like me when you support being a hard ass to people Im asking for their sake not mine. There are people on here who have been biting their lip and taking it for their entire lives.  If you do it for long enough you become a doormat you stop caring about who hurts you what anyone does to you and you give up on yourself.  You stop talking to girls because when you talked at home you got beat and you took it like a man.  So you started to masturbate because it was the only way you could be sexual or feel pleasure and you got addicted.  Now youre  expected to be something have a personality but for years youve been beaten down by addiction your life your depression you are void and you see no way out for everything youve tried.

571140,0,t3_20nwnr,Last streak was about  days but during that time I was still frequently looking at porn which turned into edging occasionally. There were some good outcomes from the streak like that I became much less irritable and more focused which was what I mainly wanted to achieve. My confidence also got pretty high. Around day  I asked out this girl in my class that I was crushing over for months. It was really weird though because she agreed to hanging out with me then never spoke to me again from the moment she said yes. I was annoyed and confused but still glad I asked her because I proved to myself that I had the balls to do what I wanted even if it made those classes with her kinda awkward. All this happened while I was still pretty much under the effects of porn so thats what my new streak is specifically gonna focus on. If I look at any porn intentionally im going to reset my badge. I reckon that my clarity will be through the damn roof by  days! Good luck to all of you guys and ill see you on the other side.,NoFap,cg56z65,1,t5_2skrn

Running.  Become lean and muscular.Eat well.  Lots of green vegetables and plants such as kale.  Cut out artificial sugary drinks.Get more sunlight especially now it is summer. It is the main source of Vitamin D.You are in college.  That is good.  Be proud of that. You are on the road to the life you want.  You will have a career soon.So in a few years say you put up an Internet dating profile.  You will be athletic intelligent no brain fog and with a good career.  You will be more independent and living your life how you want to rather than being beholden to your parents wishes.  There will be plenty of women wishing to be your girlfriend.

These times when you crave companionship that you have to learn how to deal with emotions of loneliness and sadness. You must not let them become master over you. Understand your desire it is part of what makes you human. Be strong as the hunger for a woman becomes seemingly consuming instead rejoice in the fact that you can feel those elements of life again. From there you must learn to grow you must learn from those desires about yourself and who you are.

In one way im becoming less and less guilty for being myself and caring about myself and not caring about what others think. In other way looks like i stopped caring whether i relapse or not.

Something that changed needs to be changed again.Ill have a look at Models thank you.And just to clarify i gave my phone to my sister because its an old phone which i kept.

626738,0,t1_cgbi4lk,My first time wasnt a pleasent experience either. I turned the knob to half cold and that already was a shock to my body. So i had to breath very hard which isnt good at all. But thats normal for the first few times because your body cant handle the coldness. What you have to try is stay calm at all times because you dont want to hyperventilate. Best advice would be to gradually go from hot to cold. But you could go balls to the wall like me and just turn the knob immediately to cold.Since about two weeks ago i finally turned the knob all the way to cold untill you cant turn it anymore.

628417,0,t3_21cgua,Back in December I did cold shower for about  month and when I say cold showers I mean REALLY COLD. They first week I was seriously shivering every time I did themI live in sweden so the snow outside was not helping either. Im the type of guy who basically always is cold no matter how warm the water is in the sommer with a bodyfat at around .  I had the worst possible background BUT I made it and I can tell you it gets easier after the first weeks.Its fucking awesome as soon as yoy have it as a habit. Problem is the start and I am unfortunatly on the same square as you right now due to i was a pussy a couple of weeks ago I started  day ago and this is my technique for getting used to it see if it helps youFirst week start showering  mins hot water do all the cleaning stuff turn to cold  secs turn to warm  secs. repeat step  with reduced time warm shower and increased time cold. Do this cycle about  times and finish with cold.This should help you with your initial discomfort. Hope it helps you! GJ on  days btw!Swoosh,NoFap,cgbpa7p,1,t5_2skrn

That would suggest that if you took someone who ejaculated every day for a week and someone who didnt and measured testosterone per day you would have a significantly higher baseline for the abstinent.  Its a similar argument for people who smoke weed a lot.  They argue that their are no long term memory effects which is generally true.  However if you smoke every day for  years then youve essentially given yourself the short term memory effects for...  years...Also regarding this study they didnt go beyond  days it looked like.  Would be interesting to do this for a month or longer and see how levels change also would be interesting to look at other hormonesneuromodulary factors rather than just testosterone ,NoFap,cggmpg2,1,t5_2skrn

Tips that worked for me...K the motherfucker. You can make a promise to your self and then it goes out the window as soon as you are horny. If you lock down your puter and devices and I include your phone then leave your burner email account login and password at work or somewhere inconvenient grandmas house?....this means you can get round the constant relapsing.

704320,0,t1_cgkb0y3,Absolutely man. I think getting rid of fapping takes away a crutch and we get down to our real selves and discover things we dont like. For me most of my issues revolved around my selfassessment which was readily improved by simply living like the guy I wanted to be. Two books that were most helpful to get me started down that road were Mansons Models which is more about selfimprovement than pickup and Nathaniel Brandens Six Pillars of SelfEsteem.Once I sorted out my inner demons I turned to organizing all the things I wanted to accomplish. David Allens Getting Things Done was a lifechanger in that area. Good luck brother. Just got to ask what the wall was built to protect you from and then learn to not be afraid of whatever that was. Another book that comes to mind is Alice Millers The Drama of the Gifted Child. Keep strong and congrats on making it so far!,NoFap,cgkc1aw,1,t5_2skrn

It is crucial that I forget about this girl and I find real meaning to my life...or else I will fall down. Thank you for posting this...it came at the right moment in my life.

So instead of binging to porn after work I hit the gym spend there maybe  to   hours am totally exhausted and in a positive mood afterwards come home and fall asleep in no time. Next morning wake up and my NFcounter has gone up one notch. Dont know if thats possible with hockey but I think you get the idea what I mean.

794173,0,t1_cgufngt,Then you already know the monsters. You already understand how theyre in the way of your happiness. Maybe youre still relapsing so much because being so young you still dont have the full experience of the range of consequences fapping causes. Yes you might start to think about it but maybe it hasnt hit you hard enough yet to make you really change your habits. For me in the past I wanted to stop fapping because I sensed that its causing disharmony but I wouldnt stop until later in life when it really started hitting me that Im going on my thirties and Im alone because of fapping. So maybe time hasnt come for you yet to really mobilize to quit fapping.

797894,0,t3_239hno,The reasons why noFap is NOT a cult in my opinion.. Cults are indoctrinating and difficult to leave.Where in any part of noFap is someone holding a gun to your head physically or metaphorically in any part of the noFap process? Joining noFap was either your idea or encouragement from friends or family members. At any point you could have said no and laughed it off. In fact that is what most people do because either they dont want to commit to it or they dont believe in the ideology both perfectly fine reasons by the way. If someone is forcing you to do noFap they might have a cultish idea involving blind faith that doesnt undermine the movement itself. If your religion agrees with noFap but adopts a harsher measure of punishment if you do masturbate then your RELIGION IS A CULT not noFap. Remind me if Im mistaken but whens the last time noFap caused people to get their hands chopped off burned at the stake or hung?. Cults encourage blind faith.The main reason people join noFap is because they have seen what excessive fapping and porn have done to their lives. I think people overuse the words blind faith these words mostly related to older times when people would heavily believe in some sort of false prophet or messenger and realized the person was only human or trying to make a buck. In todays world MOST LEGITIMATE ideologies or solutions have some sort of testing scientific basis or at least experimental background noFap comes here due to the countless anecdotal stories. . If noFap is a cult what does that make any religion or ancient medical practice or any doctor before the last  years?Why does almost every single religion encourage against masturbation? Why did every doctor even in the Western World as late as  tell us that excessive masturbation or sex is not healthy? Why did countless medical practice worldwide repeat the same thing that excessive masturbation is an unhealthy practice that leads to ill effects after a while. Please think about it. On very few other matters in human history have SO MANY people agreed with each other. In fact its hard getting humans to agree with each other on ANYTHING but despite all odds masturbation is heavily discouraged.. Pornography addiction and its ill effects are scientifically documented.Theres not that many cults that have science to back up their premise. Pornography IS addictive just as addictive as a physical addiction although it may be easier to break than a physical addiction given the right environment. There have also been many studies linking low testosterone to excessive masturbation.Its easy to call something a cult because either you are too lazy inept or disbelieving to follow suit. Is alcoholics anonymous or narc anonymous a cult? Because if they are a cult they are the best damn ones in the world theyve saved so many lives helped so many people and made the world a better place. So if you still think noFap is a cult thats fine by me. By the way if dont like it get the hell out. Nobody is forcing you if you are too weak to not masturbate for a few weeks thats your problem with self control. And another note noFap is NOT about permanently quitting masturbation for good even the founder says so. Its about quitting porn addictionuse completely and bringing masturbation levels down to a safe amount once every  weeks.,NoFap,cguz2ab,4,t5_2skrn
797997,0,t1_cguyihz,All of this is good advice.Also you can start learning that you can have the urge and feel it acknowledge it and NOT ACT on it.

819035,0,t3_23ihvl,Start thinking about all of the specific steps it takes you to the place where you are fapping.  Write them down if you have to.  Then cut them out of your life.  Remove temptation.  Then fill the gap left by fapping with something else.  Do something with your life find goals and then realize how fapping is holding you back.  Each moment is another step on your journey.  I dont have to feel bad about my relapses I just move on.  Is  the longest youve lasted?  cause thats only a drop in the bucket compared to where you could be.  Ive found that fapping can help me hide from my emotions and after a while my emotions can simply become too frightening to face.  Keep going and find out what it means to be free!  I believe in you!,NoFap,cgxdko4,2,t5_2skrn

822230,0,t1_cgxqbkp,I applaud your enthusiasm and the fighting spirit is necessary. But I have to be honest  it no longer helps me to think of this as a fight of myself as a warrior. What are we fighting against? Ostensibly its porn or the porn industry...but what are they really based on? Theyre based on the natural healthy instinct to reproduce that expresses itself in the form of sexual attraction. The problem isnt that I find women sexually attractive. The problem is multifaceted  people take advantage of my attractions they exploit it for their own gains and I let them. I take advantage of myself in a way that is harmful. And even to some degree people celebrate their sexuality and I want to celebrate with them. But at the root of it we only end up fighting ourselves even if we become convinced that were fighting the perversion rather than the instinct itself.Im not all that fired up at the moment  Im worn out Ive spent the day with family. But I have a feeling deep down its no so much a fire as just a warm light. I might make it to  days I might not. That comes off as apathy but its not. Im just...surrendering to God.,NoFap,cgxqmn8,1,t5_2skrn

889692,0,t3_24ab0x,Anyone telling you that you should wait until marriage is probably religiously motivated... sex can be something special but it isnt something special by default... it can be fun. It can be a passtime. I personally consider it a hobby.Your first step is to stop being insecure about it. The best way to accomplish this is to be perfectly open about it dont go out of your way to tell people but dont allow yourself to be afraid to say it either. If any of your friends make you feel bad for it find a new friend to replace them.Ignore Cosmopolitan and other magazines. Have you seen their sex tips? Theyre fucking terrible. Its like no one that writes for them has ever had sex. They dont know what theyre talking about anyway. Theyre kings of sensationalism because it sells magazines. Why the hell do you care what they say?Sex sells so it will be on TV and in movies. Its a fun activity and its written into our DNA to go after it... so of course you cant avoid it. Stop worrying about the entire subject being a trigger... its part of life get used to it. Stop putting it on a pedestal and understand that it will come to you at some point but dont worry about it because its not the endallbeall of life.If you want to have sex get out more. Five days a week find an activity you havent done that week and open yourself up to possibly meeting people. Go out to a bar with friends. Go ride your bike around a park. Hit the gym. Go see a movie even if its just by yourself. Go to the library and just read a bit. Go rock climbing. Walk around a city or town. Whatever... just go do something... youll meet people naturally and youll form relationships and some of them will lead to sex if you arent afraid of it or angry at it being all around you... if you just realize that its a part of life sometimes an activity that two people seeking to have fun and get to know each other might enjoy.Its not rocket science. The dumbest people on the planet are doing it.note I was a virgin until I was . Eventually I was sort of pushed into it my first time... it sucked... it got better. I met new girls... had fun... it got even better. Now its a hobby although one that I currently only do with my girlfriend. Im  now.Also just a tip Although as I said you should get much more comfortable about the idea of sex you should also understand that while your first time doesnt need to be with someone you love it really should be with someone that you know well enough to tell them hey its my first time... I hope thats okay and just know that Ill get better if we keep doing this,NoFap,ch5etyw,4,t5_2skrn

901029,0,t1_ch6oaxe,Just going down the line.Levin From the abstract I gather he saying that in men orgasms ejaculation have health benefits sperm health sexual functionality and some preventative functions of unspecified significance occur in relation to prostate cancer regardless of whether the orgasm is induced by coitus or masturbation. I dont think anyone here at least is arguing that sex is bad. Ill grant that masturbation has these benefits but it does not refute the NoFap position that abstinence for a period of time might be beneficial physically sexually mentally and socially. Kaestle amp Allen This article seems to sort of start with the assumption that masturbation is useful and good. The main thrust hehe seems to be that in an environment where partnered sex can be risky solo sex can work as an alternative for building a positive sexual identity. It also noted that because of stigma mast. can be a source of shame. I think this is really interesting and really I think this what NoFap is all about developing a positive sexual identity. People come here because their sexual identity is overshadowed by pornography. For a lot of average pornenthusiast redditors their sex life is only porn novelty and masturbation. I think even you might agree that is unhealthy. NoFap isnt necessarily about how masturbation is evil its about trying to recover a normal balanced sex life. Maybe theres a better way to do it but NoFap seems to be working for some people. If you still want my thoughts on the rest Id be glad to do it tomorrow but right now Ive got to sleep.

The point isnt which is exactly correct its that the truth can be far off from what we think so I feel that we might as well think the best.

It was actually reading about it on chan and my own personal sexual frustration and negative attitudes toward women despite identifying myself as a feminist that i realized it was time to own up to my porn addiction. again i dont think porn is bad. i just think i was overexposed to it as a result of getting into it through highspeed internet. im not here as a morality or a religious kind of thing. In fact those kind of posts drive me away from this subreddit. Im here for the challenge and because frankly I really miss having a boner without the assistance of a computer screen. thats really what its about. so yeah if this inspires you go for it. be awesome. just believe in yourself. i know i can do this nofap thing a lot better. now that im at day  Im going to go a little further into the hard mode.

921014,0,t3_24nozn,Ive had similar things happen to me. Its funny that you mentioned they stick their tongue out at you playfully...theres a girl I know pretty well that did that when I was walking passed her and said hi.I think there are some subtleties in body language and tones of voice that tell a woman what the mans intent is subconsciously. Ive always been good at reading peoples facial expressions and body language and I have noticed that guys who give off those macho vibes do not impress women. When they talk to them I can see it in their eyes...they arent talking to them because they enjoy their company. They are talking with them because they have the desire to get in the sac. When on NoFap with the right mentality women will notice something different about you. They can see it in your eyes. The subconscious mind is able to pick up so many messages from a persons eyes. Perhaps this is why a man who is working on improving himself and cutting out an addiction receives more attention from women. This is just my thought...,NoFap,ch8z49w,11,t5_2skrn
922560,0,t1_ch8zjk1,It seems it would be hard to somehow prove this or disprove it. I think it would be best to do with a smell test. Have lets say  males where they all have a similar diet and have them exercise for a certain time ever  days for lets say  days. Of course they would also have to have showered right before exercising and all  would wear the same type of shirt. So in the end there are  shirts for each of the males. Then you get a random sample of woman to smell each of the shirts and determine if and which one smells more attractive. If the ones that are closer to day  it would mean there may be a correlation between lack of orgasm and attractiveness .You could end up going one level up with this and testing also if a woman can sense which male would be more successful dominant maybe ? so choosing the males from different work positions. Maybe one being a CEO at a large company one would be a well paid trade job maybe and another just a cashier at a fast food place or something like that.Now if these test are done with  males like this record the results do a write up of which of the guys was classed the most attractive etc. Then begin with a new  new males and a new random sample of women. Maybe end up doing this  or so times. If there is a trend it should be easily visible after this.,NoFap,ch95fl2,4,t5_2skrn

This is not really a PMO addiction this is when acting out on PMO is really a symptom of a deeper issue. I have this one. I used PMO to mask my deepseated insecurities body image problems intimacy issues anxiety issues...et cetera et cetera.

952405,0,t3_2502g2,Yep. Drinking obviously lowers inhibitions and impairs judgement. Basically you have two choices in my opinion.. Stop drinking for a period of time. Im currently off the booze for at least a month hopefully two. It doesnt have to be a permanent thing but it will help to build a streak and the discipline is transferrable.. Just be super aware that this is a trigger and plan to make it as hard as possible to PMO after a night out. Put your laptop somewhere that drunk you will find it tricky to get to. Get a friend to change the password for  hours. Limit the alcohol intake if you dont cut it out. Put filters on the laptop. Hide the tissues. Drink some water before sleeping and above all stay strong.,NoFap,chcjor2,2,t5_2skrn

Is it not also a way to separate the weak from the strong.  Some would say it is part of the feminist agenda that pornography be so easily accessible if men continue to spill their seed they become docile and far more easily manuiplatiableand i feel there is some truth to it.Personally I think these systems were put in place to keep us from reaching enlightenment and reaching a higher vibrational state within this lifetime to turely make a lasting change in this world fluoride in our tap water advertisements for highly processed toxic foods being continuously played during breakfast lunch and dinner times songs that venerate access consumption of alcohol other drugs and a misogynistic views toward women.

If so then I guess all that porn I kept on pushing into my brain every single fucking day has definitely done its own part and I have noticed that I dont keep thinking about hard core porn as often any more and it seems to have eased my brain a bit. I look at the wet dream negatively since scientifically its your brain and body getting ready for intercourse which is good since your brain realizes what it has been doing especially in my age.

1052929,0,t1_chnvmni,If I was concerned about candida Id be more inclined to do mostly green vegetables or atleast  of each. But I think that the worst naturally occurring raw food is probably much better than the average western diet in any capacity. ive watched videos of a girl who eats  bananas a day. Freely bananna girl. She eats pounds of raw fruit every day as a bulk of her diet. Refined carbs sugars are probably about as bad for yeast as you could get. So Id avoid those primarily.What Im doing  Kefir is supposed to help with candida. Im almost  days in so far so its still inconclusive what I can expect from it. But heres some of the claims about it.  Regulates the bodys immune system and improves resistance to diseases.  Regulates the blood pressure blood sugar and cures diabetes.

Supports enzymes production and heals the pancreas.  Improves the liver and gallbladder regulates bile production influences positively hepatitis.  Regulates metabolism digestion and heals diseases of the colon.  Heals colitis diarrhea catarrh re flux leaky gut syndrome candidasis and more.  Re balance the intestinal flora and stomach acid heals duodenum and cures ulcers.  Produces its own antibiotics eliminates unfriendly bacteria cures internal and external inflammations.  Heals lactose intolerance and provides full digestibility of milk based products.  Produces own anticancer compounds prevents metastasis and leads to cure.  Slows the aging process smooths and improves skin hair and muscle tones.  Reduces anxiety depression increases energy and feeling of well being.

Overeaters generally become obese for the same reason they keep eating because their urges tell them to then suddenly one day theyre  pounds and wonder how they got there. Do you want to be a little old man alone in his wheelchair at  still fapping to porn in the nursing home?Learn to live with the urges because you are the urges. When you get hungry what do you do? Stuff yourself with donuts cheeseburgers and sodas? Do you feel shame and hate yourself? Are you eating comfort food to get over some trauma?The same is true for fapping. What do you do when you get urges? Do you stuff yourself full of junk food porn? What is the root cause?Learn to live with yourself and not fapping becomes the easiest thing youve ever done.

No lights from any electronic devices Duct Tape over the little red light on the phone charger I mean why would you even need that anyway?.It was terrifying the first few nights I did this then suddenly I was sleeping a whole lot better.Bonus mode no screens for half an hour to an hour before you plan to go to bed.

1135986,0,t3_2742cx,Before and after nofap Im a jealous guy. I know it and my GF knows it. I tell her I trust her but I dont trust the other guys especially her ex. And that part is true. It sounds like in your case this is a new relationship so you need to go with caution because being clingy can turn her off and end the relationship. But the flip side is you shouldnt put up with crap in a long term relationship. Early on my GF was connected to her ex via Facebook. I didnt like that and told her that and said eventually I would like her to disconnect. She did it for me a couple of weeks later. If she didnt do it  that would be her right and if it bothered me enough then it would be OK for me to eventually end the relationship because in the end you are the only judge of what works. To answer your question I would not be ok with her dancing with another guy. But early on in a relationship it may not be OK to ask for that if thats what shes used to. If it gets serious then its fair to ask for her to stop but its also fair if she wont then you have to decide if its that important to you. ,NoFap,chxepwg,1,t5_2skrn

1153350,0,t1_chzcvhe,TM is a trademarked thing that you have to pay something like  to learn. As far as I know its all about concentrating on your mantra. Vipassana  Mindfulness  Insight meditation doesnt use mantras and tends to focus on the breath and on other sensations physical emotional andor mental. It varies a bit depending on who you learn it from.Theres a subtle aspect to the doing nothing. You dont want to be striving actively to do nothing... that would be doing something. So instead you just notice whenever you are doing thinkingfeeling something and then bring your attention back to your breath or whatever focus you picked. Over time your mind quiets down. But if it doesnt quiet down thats OK as long as you keep observing.I think serious mindfulness meditation is actually mentally more active than most people think meditation is...There are some free books on the web about mindfulness meditation like Mindfulness in Plain English and I think the Sayadaw meditation instructions.

You are going through withdrawal symptoms as with any drug your body is not used to this lack of whatever you were hooked on so you feel horrible because you NEED it but you dont hold on and you will get through it and feel x better than you did before.. Your not used to all that sexual energy. Sexual energy is the most powerful energy it is the energy that drove our human species to procreate and it has built the civilization we see around us today. It is a very potent and volatile energy. Throughout the years you have only learned one way to deal with this energy and that is to expel it through your penis. There are other ways to deal with it. To USE this energy as our forefathers had to build a nation raise families overcome immense obstacles. How do you use it? You need to be aware its just energy and you do not need to expel it that is what weak men do because they cannot handle the awesome FORCE so they drain themselves. I think the key is meditation. Meditation gets your mind right and it clears your nervous system which in turn helps your body adjust to actually holding and utilizing this energy without your circuits frying.

1168291,0,t3_27hqhu,Wow a really powerful and useful post. First time i logged in in months also. Ive been just checking this site with one eye every now and then. Been just hugely in this porn using for the past entire  so far.Basically i got your feelings through those songs. Mind peace and happiness just the stuff i want. I just wanna show you a thumbs up really do. Happy that you have achieved this. Im currently on my first day once again without because i got an enormous hate after my last binge. Due to last time i resisted the !!EXTREME ESCALATION!! thing i pretty much freakin binged very long. Not binge but i did stay up hrsS I cannot fucking beleive it. I stayed up hr pmoing hrs of it.Its just that i lack the voice that encourages me to not do it. I have this voice that says do porn do porn do porn.. and no voice that says dont do it dont do it. Its so hard to fight this thing when you are alone against it so that even your brain is not encouraging you to stop. Im not new to this shit either. Ive now known for a good  years approximately that i have a serious porn addiction but so far not the strenght to quit for good. Now ive even began to slack on my extreme sports hobby making music and even fucking playing videogames. Basically i have energymotivation for nothing most of the time. I just sit and wonder why the hell did i get to this point?. Now at the moment i do have some energy because ive stayed away from it and because i reseted my clock after that hr awake thing with hrs of sleeping. But now there is also back again that damn voice telling me to masturbate to porn because it feels so good. I know i should not do it but its like this bulldozer that is gonna go over me because i cannot dodge it. I know i should dodge the bulldozer but i cannot because there is nothing that helps me dodge it. I dont have that inner voice to help me resist this and now i dont have that hate helping me either. Im mellow calm and im being overriden by this stupid voice.,NoFap,ci11wx4,2,t5_2skrn

1172181,0,t1_ci0xr03,That sucks but I have been with two girls like that and I wouldnt do it again either. Here is an example of one of our dates. I would ask her if she wanted to go to the movies. She would say yes but the thing was that she would tell her parents that she was seeing a different movie chickflick with her girlfriends. Her parents dropped her off late because the movie she told them that she would seeing started later and they picked her up early because it ended sooner. It sucked the only time we really even acted like a couple was at school. But even then I was very lucky if I could hold her hand because she was afraid one of her friends would see and tell her parents. I couldnt pick her up drop her off etc and I was one of the first Im my class to have a car and a license which was a pretty big deal. Take it from me girls that do everything that her parents tell her are not worth your time unless the parents are cool themselves. I used to think innocent girls were my type but that completely changed in only a couple years. In High school go for the cutefun girls youll get somewhere with them.,NoFap,ci1hod2,1,t5_2skrn

Ejaculation doesnt really affect testosterone levels the changes that do happen are in the receptors in specific areas of your brain and those changes dont come overnight.

1199974,0,t1_ci4frey,I did not mean to come across as saying that you were a newbie or anything. It is good to see that you have come farther than me and not gotten a flatline. It might be possible that I had become an extremely negative and worrisome person by nature after a while  and that it made my anxiety worse because today I dont have any. As soon as I saw that it was the flatline and that it will get better it went away.I agree with you. I am personally at a crossroads about that topic. According to me the unnatural release of dopamine when watching P is the real culprit and specially combined with an orgasm. Fapping to imagination is not as exiting but the images can be sometimes if they resemble porn. Personally I am trying not to do anything until I can fap to almost nothing but again I agree.,NoFap,ci4m60x,1,t5_2skrn

1201950,0,t1_ci4qo2q,I experimented with it back in . I did about  days of no porn and maybe  of no fap. Porn was the big one for me to be honest. I noticed a significant difference within a couple weeks of cutting it off and found it really beneficial. No fap was interesting for me but honestly it made me so ridiculously horny that I couldnt even think straight most of the time. I also became so sexual with girls I was dating that it honestly started to creep them out. I naturally have a pretty high sex drive so I actually learned that fapping occasionally can help calm me down and even me out. Everybodys different though. It was a useful experiment and something I think any man with a history of porn use should at least try out and see how it affects them. Ive see people on my forum who say that it changed their lives. Ive also seen people say that it didnt really change much at all for them. Everybodys different. As for right now I live with my girlfriend so neither porn or fapping is a huge issue. Ill occasionally fap when my girlfriend is busy or on her period or something. And every once in a blue moon Ill pull up some porn just for the hell of it. But I feel that Ive reached a good place in relation to both. I definitely had some periods when I was younger where I was a compulsive user of porn and doing the challenges helped me recognize that. I keep making the analogy but I treat pornfapping much like I treat alcohol in my life now. I enjoy a few drinks occasionally and every once in a while I may drink a lot. But I monitor myself to make sure that it doesnt become a habit or something I rely upon to feel good. I also recognize the ways it affects my health adversely. That works for me. But I realize too that thats not going to work for everybody. Some people are more biologicallypsychologically predisposed to addiction than others. So I just recommend that everybody figure themselves out and do whats right for them. ,NoFap,ci4u5vr,1,t5_2skrn

1246925,0,t3_28d8q3,Well a couple of factors matterDo you have a fat covering your pelvis you can almost gain an inch by just getting rid of the fat covering your pelvis. To see if you have fat covering your pelvis go to the base of your dong and just push down with your fingers the deeper it is the more fat you have.gt Your age the older you get the bigger the flaccid size. gt Pubes keep it trimmed and it should look a bit longer.gt And last your mood. If you are feeling sad depressed or just not in the mood for action that thing will shrink.Personally I dont care about the flaccid size I mean it is not like you are using it for anything than having it glance at the chick for a few moments before it goes hulk mode. Also a tip try to actually measure it and see if it is as biglittle as you make it look. Looks can be deceiving.  ,NoFap,ci9w7uf,1,t5_2skrn
1248013,0,t3_28e15r,Just a word of advice when you start you wont realize how hard it is to stop until you begin trying. Make going  days without PMO your goal right here right now. Trust me it will be easier to work towards a goal you can see. Then once you reach it shoot for another  days. Feel free to change it but I promise if you can go a week without fapping you will see a huge differnce between not fapping and fapping. You will feel more energy feel more emotions begin to feel better about yourself. Sure you may get a craving but overall you will feel and be different.Go all the way friend!,NoFap,cia0mgr,2,t5_2skrn

1252463,0,t1_ciadzlo,Statistically there are a few things we look for when discussing significance that most people dont know to look for.First of all sample size is insanely important as the larger the sample the higher your external validity can it be applied to the general population or is this an effect only seen in a specific population as well as increasing your reliability can this be measured again if this sans research was conducted again using the exact same methods.Secondly a lot of people dont know to look for effect size. If something is significant depending on the test we used we use a particular measure for effect size meaning how strong of an effect did our manipulation have on the group we tested? An example I can use is my very own research. In correlation we square our r value to find r and my particular research had very low effect sizes meaning my data was not super powerful in its supporting of my hypothesis. A couple ways to increase effect size would be more refined methods or a larger sample size which also happen to increase our regular scores which likewise simultaneously increase our reliability and our validity.A website like yourbrainonporn.com is a whole new problem altogether. When someone is very passionate about a subject its very hard to approach that subject objectively. Sometimes this can lead to a problem where people will look for forced significance in something they did not hypothesize ad hoc or they went looking around their data running numbers going something will come up. That or they use their passion to scream significance even if the days isnt exactly the most significant thing out there. These two fallacies are called researcher bias and confirmation bias respectively. That website was combed over by me tooth and nail when looking for research for my study and a lot of the research on there was either not very good research altogether in that it had hardly been cited in any other research citations are VERY important which is why psychologists tend to create new words in their theories to force people to cite their papers when discussing the concepts theyve created or the research just lacked in its significance. The thing is that Im not blindly finding articles that support my hypothesis confirmation bias or merely discussing ideas in a bubble that thinks just like I do where people will simply pat me on my back for sharing ideas that group specifically wanted to hear. My professors would best the hell out of me if that happened because that means my entire college education pretty much was a waste. In going to question the things I read look at their methods look at their significance and effect size scores and then start to ask questions regarding whether those scores are valid and worth discussing. Most people here dont do that make up bullshit statistics and hypotheses with no scientific merit and are praised by members in the group for their efforts. Thats called group autonomy which is a direct version of group think which actually hurts a cause more than it helps. Ever hear the saying the blind leading the blind? Its like the blind man telling the deaf dog I see. That said in not going to support my ideas with research put on a website designed to discuss exactly what were doing here in going to go on APA PsychNet and other psychological and medical databases and search for the research myself to see if I can find anything of value. Im on my phone right now but my research used a lot of data that is important to this cause as well as fishing research that directly contradicted what this group discusses and used my own experiences to come to a valid conclusion that is a result of questioning even the things I personally believe to be true as a result of my own anecdotal experiences.Based on your response in already seeing a bit of bias in your thinking and methodology tour confirming things on here with s website directly linked to the movement rather than searching third party article databases to find something to contradict your thinking. Youre only focusing on what you hope will support your ideas which in turn help rationalize your decision to quit masturbating. To me thats fine and everything but unfortunately Im not going to do that. I spent way too much time reading articles and defining statistics to just blindly just follow the first train out of the station. Honestly there is nothing wrong with that if that makes you happy but there is research discussed on that site that has no scientific value because it was either a never actually published or b never actually tested. What I did find was enough to convince me to stop masturbating but not enough to make me stop watching porn. The human brain is a lot more complicated than everyone shouting dopamine and reward pathways will ever care to admit and as such Im not just going to check my opinion at the door just to fall into the mob mentality.

The thing that peoples with power search is always more power and how to maintain it.The communist regime of Stalin made researches on what is the easier to dominate kind of society.

1305357,0,t3_28q0bi,Well this is interesting theory op. Im afraid that wet dreams resets this for a few days. Few hours after such dream I have read your post and was curious if i had those rings too  but they were non existent. No dark line at all but now after just a few days I can see them. I will observe it for the next weeks. If this is true then changes in eyes and sight might be really strictly correlated with fapping. If losing semen can influence such thing as limbal rings getting bigger or smaller then it can easily influence many other things that we cant observe. ,NoFap,ciggwp5,2,t5_2skrn

1321454,0,t3_297tv5, days!! congrats!Something that I have found has been a huge source of self improvement for me in many many ways is reading literature. Read any Booker prize winner or shortlisted book and almost everyone is a unique and eye opening look into society humanity and life in general. Most of these books are written by people with vast amounts of life experience who deeply understand people and the world but they arent preachy like self help books its up to you to analyze the characters and decide what is morally right or wrong. I think reading a good book is like getting life experience as it develops your own knowledge of the world and your analytical skills. If you are unsure try at least The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes its only a short book... anyway thats my cents.,NoFap,ciia40m,3,t5_2skrn

The longer the streak the longer youve had to change your life assuming youve put any effort into doing so and realize that the fall is just a small setback along the path of a much longer journey. Youve already made major progress and have developed some skills to cope with the day to day struggles.It seems the people with shorter streaks take the hit a lot harder because theyre in the process of trying to learn to how to handle the urges and overcome them and fail at a much more critical point while trying to  develop the skills to do so. So its a much bigger disappointment to them.Compare the frustration and hopelessness levels of a person whos tried  times to make it to  days v.s. someone whos failed once in  months....

I thought I had found my lifes meaning God..with the intensity of being on no fap I had researched thousands of ours of my life into this cult..what I learned and a cautionary tale for all never expect some one to know the meaning to your life before you do..so I would say time wise I was in this cult for about three years before I developed some critical thinking skills and left..but while I was in this cult I did not believe in sex before marriage and could not find a women within the cult it was small so I was unable to date..well when I left I was about  I had lost what I thought was my meaning in life and became depressed I would stay home on my computer all day reading up on survival skills economics and politics..the cult that I was in was an end of the world cult so apart of me still believed that something was going to happen due to my research in economics..then  years ago I had a night shift job and wouldnt see anybody other than family members and coworkers non of them girls..I tried online dating for a while but it never was a success for me..came out of it feeling like sheldon cooper like i dont need a women as I love my freedom and Independence..my girlfriend equation time  energy  money  love.. personally I would much rather have the other three things than love,NoFap,cime2fw,0,t5_2skrn

1428966,0,t3_2aiaqy,I know what you mean about kicking this versus other addictions. Alcohol was mine and it was a lot easier once I found my bottom. Cant get away from this drug. We have it with us everywhere. Well fapping is a drug. Drugs are to suppress emotions. These emotions and the overwhelmed feelings are from childhood trauma from less than nurturing parents and caregivers. Check out Pia Mellodys book on Sex and Love Addiction. Also see if you can find a therapist that works family of origin to help dig thru this history from your upbringing. Most of it is shit youve suppressed and dont even remember. Although you do see that your parentscaregivers werent there for you. This type of therapy has helped me a lot. Getting  days. I check this subreddit at least once a day. Some things are triggering so when one does start to trigger then move on to the next post. Get to some sort of group meetings drug anonymous saa or slaa and see if they resonate with you. Having a group helps like going to the gym with others. I also have a motivation to stop sexualizing every woman I see. That motivation is my young daughter. We have a great relationship. I dont want that to change when she hits puberty. Im working really hard on not checking woman out. Driving down the road I often turn to look at every car I pass to see if theres an attractive woman in there or turn my head to every woman on the side of the street. Im now trying to just concentrate on the road ahead. Thats a hard one for me. Growing up at church catholic we me and my brothers would check out the girls walking up for communion. It got pretty engrained. So thats a hard habit to break. I have the overwhelmed too much to do feelings too. Chaos is another drug of mine. What Ive started to do is finish the one thing Im doing before starting the next. I think its helping switch something. And its giving me a sense of accomplishment that really helpful.

They resort to thinking of or watching more taboo or extreme things in order to reach the same level of excitement they once had. The reason for the new appeal is that its something different and therefore exciting. If I were you I wouldnt worry so much about labels but on mending the desensitizing effects that excessive online porn has had on you. This means trying to keep from relapsing. You seek stimulation so find other ways of achieving this  whether its mental social physical ie. exercise skydiving etc or other forms of stimulation that will get you a high and hopefully keep you from relapsing.,NoFap,ciy9hqd,1,t5_2skrn

1492254,0,t3_2ba3g2,Hey man Id advice you to have a look at the Taoist point of view of this issue. Basically what is thought is that through ejaculation we lose our life force Jing so you can imagine this like a stream of energy flowing out of your body and this is why we feel totally depleted after an orgasm with ejaculation. It takes a certain number of days to refill your reserve of Jing and it is said that is strictly related to a persons age. You can apply a simple multiplication to figure out how many days you should wait before having another orgasm  . x your age . This calculation tends to be a bit off once the age increases so as a rule of thumb I would say to add a  anytime to be safe So for example if you are  you should wait . x    days but adding a  it would be  days. Now having sex with your significant other is another story. The energy that you lose is partially regained from your partner cause you are absorbing the energy that she releases so its like an exchange of energies. Although Im perfectly aware that all this above sounds like a bunch of crap I just think that this spiritual way of describing these acts masturbation and sex has scientific basis that are still not completely studiedexplained. So we have to cope with that explanation for the moment.The only recent scientific study that I know of addresses the issue of lost testosterone and it has been proven that the normal level of testosterone goes downhill right after an orgasm and the slowly rises again the optimal level after  days on average over the subjects tested. So if you really want a fixed number Id say  week of wait everytime.Anyway for me the fact that I feel very tired and unwilling after I masturbate is a sort of proof of all that Taoist view. Also when I have sex with my gf I may feel tired which it could be justified anyway since we had actual physical movement but mentally I feel much much better the exchange of love and emotions makes it a pleasant experience and I dont feel like shit and like wanting to quit forever like we experience after fapping.Hope that this gives you a different point of view. Stay strong!,NoFap,cj3bufq,1,t5_2skrn

1501943,0,t3_2bef9u,Well this is what this entire subreddit is about but I think despite even the dopamine addiction problems it does a lot more damage to the brain.A lot of people just masturbate when theyre stressed  uneasy to relieve themselves and yes it works and it makes you feel fantastically better. The thing is you are essentially desensitizing yourself to your own feelings and putting yourself into a numbed state of reality. Because youre always so comfortable and relieved you lose effortmotivationetc. And it really does become a vicious cycle.For example I know everyone knows how you can start off doing homework and think oh Ill have a quick fap to get concentrated or whatever and then get back to homework because its just stressing you out so much. Well you do and then its impossible to do homework because you are no longer stressed and now youre tired etc..This is a huuuuuge harm to the brain alone and this doesnt even include how porn ruins your perception of women  image of sex  confidence etc...,NoFap,cj4jj5d,7,t5_2skrn

1510894,0,t3_2bihxy,A couple things. The part of you that rationalizes PMO is only part of you. It is not the you that wrote this post. Its not the core of who you are. I think of that part as my porn brain or my addict voice. It was a constant struggle with my porn brain for so long. Ive been trying to reboot for a year and Im just now learning how to take away the power from my porn brain. My porn brain will do every fucking thing in its power to get me to use porn. It craves it. It lies to me because it lusts for dopamine. It says just one more time or youre never going to find a boyfriend anyway you may as well jerk off and find something incredibly hot to watch while you do it. Ive learned that it only has as much power as I choose to give it.. Your existential dilemma is easily turned right the fuck around. You only have A FINITE TIME HERE dude. You may not get as many chances as you think to have sex with girls ok or experience a truly fulfilling sexual partnership one of the best things about life and consciousness according to many. Porn is easier and it sometimes seems like it feels better but real life interaction iscan be so much more satisfying. Its worth the work. You could die in  years. Would you rather be looking back at yourself masturbating furiously in front of a computer screen every day or creating loving beautiful memories with people you love? Your porn brain is lying to you when it tells you that that scenario is too difficult too farfetched and that you may as well jerk off instead. Its a lie. I used to tell myself the same thing. If you havent visited yourbrainonporn.com yet you should. It wasnt until I had enough information about how severe this addiction can be and how serious the problems it creates are that I began to acknowledge what PMO had done to my life. Watch the videos. Read the articles. Read everything. You only have a finite time to do it.,NoFap,cj5o02y,2,t5_2skrn

1535171,0,t3_2bte6d,I started nofap two years ago.The day I decided to try my brain decided that Id only be able to think about one thing every single day. I lasted six days. Cracked.Then I made it two weeks. The longest Id ever been without PMO since the age of . Then I cracked again.It was after that that I could not get past a week without PMO for several months. It was like I was carrying around a burden with me. Christmas arrived and for the first time ever I had it all to myself. No family around and no friends. So I let myself off the hook. Five days of PMO. Felt like st on day five and I knew why. I then resolved to carry on with nofap I made it two months before I caved. Was quite proud of myself. Then I made it  weeks then three and then not long after that just shy of three months.It takes time and dedication to get there. Having a clear purpose for what you want to achieve will help too. Im still trying to make it to three months and beyond because Im sick of PMO me. Im beginning to think that being physically active working out will probably help a lot too. Dealing with that excess energy. But this is a learning journey when you fail ask yourself the question why did I? You might learn a few things about yourself and be able to deal with it better next time round.,NoFap,cj8pjxh,3,t5_2skrn

1543658,0,t1_cj9pzpc,I have not read much about that from the internet all though i am sure there is a ton of information try what ever resonates with you and leave the jumbo mumbo stuff out. Personally I try to redirect my awareness off the anger as soon as it starts kind of the same with nofap. Anger is kind of like an avalanche it gives you only a few small warning signs the first anger impulsesthought. If you fuel it by giving it your attention it will come down full on that is why such an emotion must be dealt with at its first stages because once its let loose there is no stopping it. And oboy it is such an energy consumer. The best thing to refocus your mind on is relaxing taking deep slow breaths and feelingimportant the relaxations of the muscles as you breath out will cause a physical relaxation in your body your mind will follow. Perhaps also tell yourself something like relax i am perfectly fine there is nothing to be upset about. repeating this will make it impossible for your brain to come up with new aggressive and irritative thoughts again not fuelling your anger with your awareness but rather giving yourself suggestive commands to calm down.Try it out!,NoFap,cj9rs4a,1,t5_2skrn

Im fairly spiritual as well so Id always tell myself God will forgive me anyway. Or something as irrational as that. I think last week I had a dream. I was in the house that I lived when I was  Im  now and I was grown which is weird because I obviously no longer live there. I was eating an egg roll and my mother said something that ticked me off. I dont get upset at my mother like that so I found this kind of scary.Im very good at lucid dreaming so I tried to take control of the dream at the time. When I tried to do that I felt a chill go down my body and suddenly in my dream I screamed at my mother. My eyes got wide and I started to eat the egg roll very strange like. I knew that that was no longer me and was a demon. I woke up and felt like crap because I knew what my dream was telling me. The fact that I couldnt even take control of my dream set me off thinking I need to change this. Anyway I hate porn just as much as you and for some reason I have a hard time stopping.

It should make you happy to be so alive.But lots of us are in the habit of using that energy in nonproductive ways. Dont sit around in fantasy mode. Dont seek out images. If you dont have a partner or its not appropriate to act on your urges in real life use that amazing energy to get your blood pumping. Run dance chop wood do pushups yoga whatever....

1595142,0,t3_2cjopx,Its best to start NoFap as early as you can. I started porn when I was  and am . This journey could change your outlook on life for the better. Dont ever doubt that porn is damaging to us and that we have an addiction to fapping. Just trust me on that. I went through periods of doubt but I was wrong in the end. Just because society tells you that fapping a day is healthy that is not true. Depression is something you may experience. Highs and lows are to be expected in life...but especially during a reboot. I had a few flatlines and I felt bad at times. But once you get out of flatlines and your energy and mood are back to baseline levels you will feel alive again. Just be aware that flatlines can come at unexpected times. It is a way for our body to recover. Not that you shouldnt treat your addiction any less that if you were addicted for  years but I would say that you will recover faster than I did. But again this is different for everyone.I want to give you advice so that you might not fall like I did. I went  days without porn or ejaculation. I relapsed without porn as soon as I stopped taking NoFap seriously. Then after a week or two of more relapses I relapsed to porn. That is where I struggled. I am still getting out of this but with this streak I am more grounded. Fapping helped me cope with my anxiety and panic attacks. But it was not a healthy thing for me. If you want to have healthy relationships in the future stay with NoFap. Porn screws up our minds especially when it is an addiction. It teaches us to objectify women that sex is all about pleasure and that fapping to videos is okay. Dont let the larger masses convince you otherwise. Again whenever you doubt yourself know that you are doing good for yourself. ,NoFap,cjg8k9o,5,t5_2skrn

I had a similar situation however it wasnt about being gay or not did have a few girls think that at some point and people just kept assuming without actually asking for my opinion. To be honest I do not blame porn for my problems I just know there are some people out there who are so fucking annoying that one would wish to stab them in the eye.  The best thing I have ever done in my life was to become a loner. I have never felt happier in my life. Here is a list of positive things that I find about loneliness    I have no obligations to anyone.  I dont care what people say about me and to be honest they cant say much about me since no one really knows me besides first name and a few other details.  I dont have to pretend to be someone that I am not.  More time for myself! Just the massive hassle of having to play by the social rules well doesnt apply to me.  I can focus on myself and become real good friends with me.

No fapping!  Part of the idea of nofap is that you take out the entirety of PMO in order to speed the recovery process its not scientifically proven that it works but thats a different issue.As for your second question Ive never suffered from PIED so take it for what its worth but the problem is literally all in your head and I am very used to dealing with other such sorts of problems.  Youll probably be best off if you spend some time waiting it out and bettering yourself in other capacities that way youll a be choosing not to rather than failing to which is empowering though you dont want to do it forever and b be a more confident person by the time your hiatus is over.

I was suffering from PIED as well but even using porn .. I almost could not finish with the antidepressants on board. Remember this simple test. If you can get hard by yourself  to porn and also finish the pipes are ok and its most likely PIED.  If you cant do that alone using porn and  or sex with your significant other the pill is doing it.. most likely. If you have major depression you need to get that under control before you ditch the pill. You can ask to lower the dose maybe and test the pipes.

You dont need to go proving yourself every time we go out.  I am a very conscientious person which is a blessing and a curse.  I sense right away when a girl is not feeling my vibes and I dont try to force it. But I definitely need to start stepping further out of my comfort zone a little bit at a time.  Its hard dude because Ive dated maybe  girls in the past  years Im  now and they were never random girls that I met at a bus stop or anything.  I already had an in with them and was socially included whether it was working together going to high school together having mutual friends whatever.  Never knew how socially naked I feel without some sort of previous association to the person.

1635005,0,t3_2c3s91,I signed up in the past and deleted my profile because of shame. I went without PMO for around  months.Back again and I lost count. I stopped at some time in mid July.Ill start my count today though. Thanks for having this. Watched some Ted talks about abstaining from porn. Really helps. Ive been watching it since grade school.But my porn was before the internet age. My locked was filled with women from magazines. Some biker magssurfingetc. Since then that  month span is the only time I have really stopped. I mean it has slowed down a little but I could not stop. In grade school and high school it was non stop. Never really had a girlfriend. Ive only kissed a girl around  times. Porn has desensitized me to the point that I really cannot talk to the people to the opposite sex. Too scared. Now that I am  years old I have no confidence. Most of the porn stars are looking perfect on the male and female side. I did look at a website and it showed how porn really was FAKE. Lots of makeupimplants. The website showed how porn stars were with their makeup off. I used to have almost  terabyte of porn on my hard drive. Even from the earliest videos from dial up. I feel much better without porn. Its still hard to get away from it cause mostly every magazine bill board has half naked girls on it. I would like to find new people to hang out with too. But I am too scared to tell them that I have a porn addiction. My friends always want to go to strip clubs and get off on the girls in the booth. Never did like that. One of them even did the math how man guys they do everyday. People think Im gay or homosexual not to offend anyone because I have never been with a women. Also Porn has really killed me. I guess you can call me average sized but I always say not big enough because of what I was seeing. Maybe one day I would be able to talk to a girl. All of them are with the Alpha Males. I am not very muscular  lbs at . At my biggest weight I was around  lbs. So I have lost a great deal of weight. Hopefully I can break out of my shell and talk to women. People say everyone has a person out there for them but as of now I am doubtful. Just like jamiroquia the artist said its VIRTUAL INSANITY. Even though I am a virgin still. I would still like to have a relationship with a woman But most of the people I know are in the HOOKUP generation. I am kind of old fashioned. Would rather find a plain jane category of girl then one that is flashing every part of her body. Nobody is natural now a days. FAKE FAKE FAKE.sorry I wrote so long. I hope everyone can stop.Thank you very much to whoever started this.Thanks for your time.,NoFap,cjl9a3e,1,t5_2skrn

1682680,0,t3_2dnp0k,By relapsing most of us are referring to something that sets you back. Watching porn while trying to regain arousal to real women isnt going to help AT ALL.In terms of NoFap as a challenge relapsing I.E resetting your badge after PMOing is something nearly ALL of us do. And its usually good that we can take positively from it and continue to learn from our mistakes and grow as people.If by relapse you just meant masturbation in general... many people do PornFree which means they continue to masturbate but just quit watching porn. Many people can continue to have a healthy masturbation routine and address their addiction or issues with pornography. Theres nothing WRONG with masturbation itself. Most things are good in moderation,NoFap,cjr9jiq,1,t5_2skrn

Thats how your bond stays healthy and honest. You need to convey your concerns and feelings as does he. So sit down and see what happens. As for not having sex while he is on NoFAP. If he starts and stays true then he will have been clean for  weeks. So if you have sex after those  weeks then I doubt you are really going to hurt his recovery process especially considering how little you see each other. So all this being said.

From that link you posted  I used to experience virtually every symptom. Im an athlete and train tons of hours a day. Since I run Ive always been really keen on proper breathing i.e. breathing through stomach not chest etc. but I never realized how excessiveimproper it was. There are other factors that I think may have resulted in the same issues however. For example when I started taking specialized multivitamins since a month ago First Endurance MultiV I immediately felt the coldness in my body leave no more cold handsfeet cold body.. Brain fog was reduced too vitamin b?. I was also a vegan and after going back to being a vegetarian since a week ago and drinking a cup of raw milk daily a lot of respiratory issues subsided too. Also I have a deviated septum so my body doesnt get the full amount of oxygen needed per breath. Not sure if this is something that caused me to breathe more deeplyincorrectly in the first place? I have been taking quercetin wbromelain and its helping reduce the sinus pressurepostnasal drip symptoms.Im looking upfollowing the links youve posted it really looks beneficial.

Off the top of my head Depression Lack of actual sex drive Erectile dysfunction and personally for me it worsens my OCD and gives me intense brain fog to the point of feeling like a zombie and not being able to function as well as the lack of sex drive. In simple scientific terms your reward system becomes totally fucked up and dopamine levels in the brain can become depleted and so you can feel these effects if you constantly do it. Now they may not seem like bad things but they fucking are and believe me they destroy the quality of life. Fair enough if you have a healthy attachment to it but Nofappersaddicts generally dont and do it so much that it takes them away from real life they become obsessed and can get issues like I just listed.

1766343,0,t3_2encia,Everything you do affects all of the people surrounding you.  This really strikes a chord for me because recently Ive begun to feel a buzz from offering my time to people and now without sounding overly confident I just feel that by offering my time and presence I can put a smile on peoples faces and make their day better I suppose. For example when I volunteer to work at a charity shop or spend time with friends and family I feel this way and I suppose that nofap has enabled me to do that with the increased confidence and energy that its given me. ,NoFap,ck1sxtq,1,t5_2skrn
1768079,0,t1_cjxtaa6,Well thats point. What you eat effects your thoughts in some way. I know if I have too much spicy food or coffee or meat I am more aggressive and emotional than when I have a hearty veg soup and a falafel. The Indians and Chinese talk about the effect of various foods on the quest for semen retention look it up. What you eat effects state of mind which affects noc emissions or the want to fap.

1770800,0,t1_ck2bx6y,Basically my point is that a mentally healthy person doesnt just start engaging in an addictive behavior. Yes heroin is pleasurable. Yes a cold beer is a nice way to unwind. Yes porn videos on your laptop trigger your pleasure centers. But that alone isnt sufficient. There are people who can engage in all of those behaviors and not be compulsive and unhealthy. The necessary ingredient is pain emotional pain. That is what drives the addiction. The existence of certain things that are pleasurable doesnt create addicts. ,NoFap,ck2d5bh,1,t5_2skrn

I had no desire to watch porn or masturbate until around the  day mark then the urges started getting stronger and stronger. Im not sure if I done anything special but Im willing to share what I did do.First of all  I avoided any and all sexual content throughout my duration. Rarely fantasized and if I did I would quickly dismiss it. I started working out nearly everyday eating really healthy Id recommend blueberries and nuts they are known to be great brain food. Drinking lots of water. Taking fish oil and multi vitamins. And most of all I just had faith in my body that my libido would return.

Clear skin and symettry is a sign of good genes and absence of any underlying diseases and conditions. Furthermore it decreases testosterone and testosterone is responsible for building the more masculine and attractive facial features such as sharp jawline defined cheekbones and etcquit fapping become more attractive.,NoFap,ck6auwo,1,t5_2skrn

The symptoms you are describing have been felt by hundreds of thousands of men just like yourself and many men have found NoFap to be the cure. My first five days were also fairly easy aside from a bit of insomnia. Everyone goes through the process differently. The changes you will feel are going to be subtle but slowly youll notice positive changes in your attitude confidence and mental health. You will react to situations differently than before see people in a different way and all around feel like a better person. Be sure to check back in with us regularly to let us know how you are doing and how you are feeling.

Im not sticking up for anything particular here and definitely not trying to excuse any bad habits but it seems things like waterskiing fighting playing cards etc etc etc could also be considered unhealthy mindless and artificial. Things like videogames and movies can also have certain cognitive benefits even if entirely fantasy.Guess Im more curious about opinions or evidence on how to make distinctions between good and bad dopamine highs.

1884640,0,t3_2g65jz,The act of sex is so much different than looking at a screen and playing with yourself. After a ton of pmo your brain associates that action with sex. When you have actual sex your moving around theres no screen theres anothet person to think about and someone else provides the pleasure instead of just you. This can fuck sex up big time I feel its why many people have to picture porn just to get it up or finish. Your brain needs to learn what real sex is and that its completely different than the instant gratification of whacking it.,NoFap,ckgai7l,3,t5_2skrn
1888269,0,t1_ckgpo30,. I first wanted to stop PMO at around  or . I tried a few times. I would say at around  I truly pursued NoFap for the first time but consistently failed over and over again my longest streak was probably around  days though most were much smaller and full of edging. Something about Fall  was different and I actually didnt realize how much of a streak I was on until I was into day  or .. Yes. I still get urges. Interestingly urges have increased since getting married but I think that is because introducing the O of PMO back into my life has resulted in stronger physiological urges. While the urges are still there they arent nearly as strong as they were in the past. Previously PMO was largely wrapped up in my emotions and my moods and my selfworth. Now I ground my selfworth and my emotions in other things.,NoFap,ckgq86d,14,t5_2skrn

1889922,0,t1_ckgujiu,I feel like if I never experience PMO I would get  hard just at the thought of touching a sexy womans body. But because of PMO normal reallife women do not get me physically aroused. However now that I am slowly healing I am getting semierections or sometimes  erections that diminish after about a minute. I feel like if I stay away from PMO more and more then my semierections will turn into full erections. I dont know how the whole flatline process fits into it.  I have a hypothesis that you cant just stay away from porn but you must actively flirt with real life women in order for that to replace porn. I still get random flashes of porn scenes in my head sometimes but I also can fantasize about real life women and that can get me hard no relapses thus far  but I Feel like spending time with real life women and not PMOing so I can actually get hard will help speed up the process. ,NoFap,ckgxeeh,1,t5_2skrn

I was on a  day streak once and I was going through a complete flatline I couldnt get an erection at all I felt so unmotivated to do anything at all and I just felt depressed.

Install and configure K Web Protection to block pornographic material. For mobile devices find an equivalent Parental Controls application. Create a complex password which is difficult to memorize write copies of that password on paper and store the copies offsite e.g. work someone elses place.

1964162,0,t3_2h596b,Lets see here. Please be kind to your readers and use paragraphs.. NoFap is not about feeling guilty. Strong emotional associations with PMO are likely counterproductive. Feelings are largely transient and the guilt anger or whatever you feel after relapsing will not protect you for long. It is about exploring one component of a project of greater overall wellbeing. If you find your life and that of others is better because of PMO I dont really have a reason for you not to engage in it. . It pays to be scrupulous when your triggering threshold is low. Are you suggesting its a better strategy to engage in activities that have a high probability of triggering a relapse? Better to err on the side of caution.. I agree that masturbation and porn are not the same. Porn is likely a lot more damaging. On the other hand masturbation and porn tend to be tightly associated and many would have difficulty engaging in one without the other.. Where are you getting your forum addiction statistics from? Why is it obvious that addicts would seek help offline? Its more likely that anonymous forums like this invite people to open up without fear of societal repercussions.. Coming here on the same day you broke your streak with a long diatribe against NoFap comes off as an attempt to justify whats happened to yourself. Let us know in a month or two how its going for you if its gone well great.,NoFap,ckpvt3h,12,t5_2skrn

I think this is largely why people on this forum often report many other benefits coinciding with their efforts. Guilt over relapsing may actually be working contrary to your goals as strong emotions coinciding with PMO may reinforce neural pathways. Work through it as objectively as you can.

2003003,0,t1_cku8e4f,Im not very good at it as well to be honest and now I wonder why. Probably too much expectations when you really really need to let go of the outcome?I remember  occasions when the Law of Attraction worked for me. The first one was when I was study for an admission test. I wasnt very confident but while I was studying I remember imagine how it would have felt to pass it. I really really wanted to get in and I was imagine how awesome it would be to. It was motivating. I did the test not expecting much just hoping. I didnt feel like I did it very well. I came in fourth in about  people and I thought WOW. Totally unexpected.Another time I was working on a web project to make money online. I tried a lot and I had always failed. But this time was different I was motivated. I felt like I couldnt fail because of some genius insights I had. I knew what was going happen and I was feeling amazing. Best feeling in the world. I made a lot of money that time. Never made so much in such a short amount of time. Its a long story but this is the point.Are you afraid of something and thats holding you back? Are you running away from it instead of dealing with and acting despite the fear? For example if you want more girls in your life but you are afraid of cold approaching them and cant do it you cant expect to become the irresistible guy. If you want to change you have to change obviouslyAre you really really doing your best or could you do more but dont cause again fears lazyness dopaminedriven quick pleasurable fixes i.e. playing videogames watching videos on youtube checking out social media for example? Again are you approaching girls or are you waiting and waiting until it will all be perfect? Spoiler alert it will never be Are you willing to give up control and surrender to whatever the outcome will be even though you have put in massive massive work? Can you enjoy the approaching part feeling excited because you are the man and you dont care if the girl rejects you or not? If you cant you havent been approaching enough. The first approaches are always the most traumatic yet the most important cause they actually change you.  Just search for let go of the outcome on Google like I just did. A lot of interesting reads.Ive found a proverb I really like and this is the law of attraction workingIf we are facing in the right direction all we have to do is keep on walking. ,NoFap,ckuk71f,3,t5_2skrn

2045534,0,t1_ckzsdr0,gtRemember you dont have to DITCH the Internet you just have to restrict it and cut down on the noveltyheavy sites. So if is reading this correctly we only need to restrict noveltyheavy sites. In the original post it seemed to give the message of restricting time on the Internet in general. If were avoiding novelty then I guess nonnovel sites that are engaging dont need to be limited. Correct me if Im wrong on that assumption. gt TV and video games could be bad I havent read about them but I suspect theyre nowhere near online porn.I wasnt trying to compare TV and games to porn. I was trying to compare it to your example of Internet and social media being dopamine triggers and an addiction. I know you just said you havent read about TV and games but maybe you can still answer this based on general knowledge. If were avoiding novelty then does TV and video games cause the same type of triggers of novelty or does it get negated if were engaged? You mentioned zoning out in front of the TV. Why would that be a better choice than zoning out in front of the computer or on a smartphone? The tumblr page mentions Internet addiction and needing to restrict it to reset. Would zoning out in front of the TV cause TV addiction? What if youre not addicted to the Internet in general? Should you still restrict it? Okay so I had written all that before I read in depth on the source links you provided on the tumblr to YourBrainOnPorn specifically the one on Internet addiction. Im going to leave it because I want to know what you have to say about that.Now that I read the Internet addiction article it mentioned video game addiction in the article so I guess video games should be avoided also or at least you need to know whether youre addicted or not. What constitutes addiction in these cases? Theres been times where I got a new game and spent the entire weekend playing it but that was when I worked  hour weeks and only had time to play it on the weekend. I was able to stop when I had to go do other stuff so I dont think I was addicted. But the article mentioned people playing for prolonged periods as being addicted.It also mentioned the  signs of addiction being desensitization sensitization hypofrontality and abnormal white matter. Can you use these parameters to tell if youre addicted? ,NoFap,ckztzj1,1,t5_2skrn

Even when I was regularly smoking I was never to the level of it being a hobby.I use substances as medicines not as enhancers or whatever stupid shit rtrees will come up with. Its not so beneficial to come up with assumptions of much lest you want to prove yourself wrong publicly.If youd want I could point you in the direction of neurologists ? was that the word you meant? and psychiatrists concluding that substances such as psilocybin and psilocin actually are serotonin agonists and lead to upregulation of certain hta sites. In laymens this means that when used responsibly the drugs you consider to cause you to be lazy and stupid actually cause spikes of creativity overall wellbeing as well as other proven positive side effects like a more stable ego in psychology terms which can sustain more trauma and curing of treatment resistant disorders like PTSD. Straight up it caught mainstream when rTIL is posting it and it pops up front page of reddit.Your prejudices came across greatly throughout your simple reply though Ill give you that. Even going so far as insulting the creator by defining it through a movie made for simple minds on Netflix. The very nature of that video is to show you point H but one facet of Ultimate Reality when you open your mind up.Overall though you both did portray very egotistical tendencies.

I want my body to completely forget what its like for me to touch it and I want to experience what its like for a woman to.Ive hit  years of age and PMO has completely nullified my physical desires to have sex in the real world.

2107431,0,t3_2j26eb,Glad you are asking THAT question before getting married yourself. Where do I start? Ummmm Ok. The idea that a normal woman should be like Caesars pizza hotn ready really comes from porn and a diatorted concept of marriage. Women get in bad moods they have their period they get tired angry or upset for different reasons in the most unexpected times. That may or may not have anything  to do with you but if you are horny and she is not up to it then it goes back to old PMO habits if you cant contain yourself.. Women have an uncanny ability to detect if all you want from them is to have sex. Initially all that may be exciting but after a while they start feeling used and resent to be used as a bathroom. In their own words.. She might enter the marriage with a different idea than you. Her idea might be to have intimacy an emotional and romantic connection and to build a life toghether. While your idea might be that now youll finally enter a sexual paradise. And if that idea was born from and fueled by porn then get ready for a lot problems that affect the relationship and hence the sex life.This is what I can think of right now.

Increase your odds of success with the means available including education intelligent strategies and sustained practice to rewire and strengthen your mind.Some suggestions mileage may vary Meditate on a regular basis to strengthen your mind. Youre going to be running a mental marathon and training your mental muscles and gathering some insight into the nature of craving and aversion will help. I cannot overemphasize this one as it will also help to deal with anxiety and other psychopathologies. If youre unfamiliar with this territory Sam Harris has some nice guided meditation audio here Start introspecting your urges as described here Educate yourself on the implications of PMO. A good start is the videos and articles here and this series. Consider taking up healthy pastimes and projects to spend time and energy on. Cold showers may be a good way to defuse and build up some mental fortitude. See here Delete any triggering material you have on your electronic devices. Install and configure K Web Protection to block pornographic material or Net Nanny if you dont mind investing a few dollars. For mobile devices find an equivalent Parental Controls application. Create a complex password which is difficult to memorize write copies of that password on paper and store the copies offsite e.g. work someone elses place. That way you can reconfigure K if you have to but not so easily that it facilitates relapse. Consider the many useful tips and tricks hereAs most if not all fapstronauts know relapsing is often part of the process. Of course we take as many reasonable measures as we can to avoid relapsing but when we do relapse its important to remind ourselves The goal is mental wellbeing and nonexploitation not a badge number or streak. Failure and coursecorrection are a part of skill acquisition. Abstaining from PMO is a skill that will take time and effort to acquire but will also serve you well in many other ways. I think this is largely why people on this forum often report many other benefits coinciding with their efforts. Guilt over relapsing may actually be working contrary to your goals as strong emotions coinciding with PMO may reinforce neural pathways. Work through it as objectively as you can. Meditation can help here also.At the end of the day you have to ask yourself whether your life is overall better when you arent engaging in PMO even if you are relapsing. Even with relapses if youre getting good days and streaks those are sufficient warrant in and of themselves.,NoFap,cl8l9br,2,t5_2skrn

2115026,0,t3_2j4uru,A femstronaut here. So perhaps a slightly different perpective. However I find that with having sex throughout I get the Chaser Effect very very bad. My the guy Ive started seeing and I will have sex and then the next  hours after that I have the worst urges. Although in some ways it is easier cause I am getting a regular release. As for the sex though well weve been going through various changes and transformations with that too. The guy I am seeing in on the NoFap challenge too he introduced me to it except he is a lot further ahead than me. So he is at a point right now where he seems to be going through a surge of energy and has a high libido. Whereas I seem to be going through a bit of a flat line atm... Ive always had a high libido so thats not really changed but I dont seem to be able to orgasm at this stage at all. Though it hasnt mattered for us that we are at different stages though. In fact with us and our sexual experiences are just leading us to be more intimate and comfortable with one another. Its sort of like it has just taking everything to a whole other level for us.,NoFap,cl8nz27,2,t5_2skrn

If you see a therapist they know how to help process trauma like that. A psychiatrist can prescribe medication if your depression ends up being a chemical imbalance or if its caused by the trauma medication can help you get through therapy and you dont have to take it for too long.Youre still very young if you can start with a therapist soon it is much easier to help heal trauma now then if you were much older. As well once you deal with your depression it will be easier to make your life better. And if you want to find a girlfriend it is much easier when it is being treated.  Relationships or even friendships are much easier with a full cup. Ive suffered some pretty severe trauma as well and spent a few years doing nothing but playing video games before I saw a therapist. I empathize with you. I hope that you can get the help you need quickly you deserve it. ,NoFap,clcjxk3,1,t5_2skrn

2160249,0,t1_clec8a8,I think thats something of a fallacy actually.The body will always want sex. That doesnt mean it needs it. From a biological standpoint the reason why were provided with these incentives to have sex is so that well reproduce. Of course the body wants us to binge when we can because evolutionary psychology assumes that that wont always be available to us. But in a natural situation without contraception nobody is going to be prepared to have sex until theyre committed enough to stay and raise a child.The closest thing I know of to this is the bodys craving for fatty foods. Of course it tastes good. Of course we want it. The body is assuming that it wont always be there and also that we have actually done work to obtain it. But in a modern situation with globalisation neither of those are true. Once the situation changes in that way the pitfalls into addiction become bigger than the straight and narrow path that you assure yourself you can stay on.,NoFap,clef10x,5,t5_2skrn

2221757,0,t3_2kkkdj,I used to be considered a math genius as a kid. Then P happened and later PMO.Im still good at math but I feel like there was so much potential which I wasted just because I put my energy in useless things. After wasting all that energy your brain cant function nearly as well which I guess can easily be seen as slight ADD symptoms.I think if you have ADD there is a lot more that you need to do other than just doing NoFap such as having the right nutrition and getting the exercise that you need you probably know that a lot better than me. But NoFap will help you with not wasting your precious energy which you need for other things. You will probably never be able to fully get rid of the ADD symptoms but you can definitely lessen them with the right lifestyle.Sticking with NoFap will definitely be worth it for you.

2268652,0,t3_2l6rt1, yo lurker here dont have a badge but been on nofap for almost  months. My main motivation for nofap was to cure my ED in the form of DE and going limp  min after penetration because of lack of sensitivity down there. The one thing I will say about attempting sex during nofap is that you have to have a confidence b a good partner. If you dont have confidence youll develop PA and that is a whole different can of worms and the same goes for having a partner. If shes a bitch and gives you shit for your ED its not going to go well.I have both of those Ive always been confident and good with women. Never got the fog or any social anxiety that many porn addicts report my only problem is ED. The girl is my friend. She knows the situation and shes totally cool with it. I havent Od with her yet but every time we try once a week it does get better. I can physically feel sensation being restored to my penis which is a huge confidence booster. Been in a major physical flat line for the past  weeks so excited to see what happens when I come out of it.I guess its about perspective in the end if you can spot the little progress you make every week and keep yourself motivated as opposed to being like I failed again then sex IMO is perfectly fine. However if you find having unfinished sex drives your urges up then its probably a bad idea. I guess youre the best person to judge that.Just my  cents.,NoFap,cls4imj,2,t5_2skrn

Its obvious that guy wanted help from nofap since he has posted here before.I have to say there were some people who were calm joked around in the comments. I salue them for not taking measures like some assholes and the amount of hate the guy recieved is not really equal to the crime.Im sure a lot of more people PMOd because of these posts bringing him attention. The mods wont work any faster simply a report and ignore is the best not only for this. But for a lot of things in life in my opinion.

Are you a createrbuilder? Are you interesting? Think of all those things and realize that no woman wilk approach you if youre  not about shit. You gotta be worth something bro.

You gotta be out there grinding getting it... for yourself. And women will come flocking.Hang in there though. Realize that your fapping is whats  getting you depressed.

I started to lose my sense of self because the relationship started to mean more to me than my own goals and aspirations.  I was also crippled by selfdoubt which she simply couldnt handle she broke up with me yesterday.  I think I should continue to build new relationships but maybe Im not fully ready for a mature romantic relationship.  I dont know.  This is all uncharted territory for me.  I still feel like I have a sexual addiction.  My therapist thinks I should go six months to a year without sex in addition to cutting out the porn.

Think of it this way bro... You were a caterpillar for so damn long. People made fun of you cause youre fat and slow and eat all day. Youre socially awkward and all the girls think your weird looking Crawling and crawling over rocks and dirt and finally you decided to give this cocooning a chance. You are finally ready to get out of this cocoon but the struggle is real. Its painful and exhausting to break free from your own cocoon... That cocoon in your case might take  days or even  days... But the prize at the end is completely worth it.You will have wings to fly  and you will experience a world beyond the rocks and dirt and the once laughing bugs around you will be even more insignificant. Those worms and dung beetles wont even be in your realm of life because now you have wings playing with the bees and the challenging the wasps. Simply put yes bro haha it gets better man. Much much better .  days is just you screaming and whining like a child wanting his toy. PMO is your toy for YEARS but now its taken away. OF COURSE yourd body is going to drive you mad to have it.  I WANT IT I WANT IT!But after a while... I would say maybe day  You will have better control over it and by the time you reach  it would have whizzed on by . By then the thrive of reaching your goal will set you on a bigger ambition. Now you want to shoot for the stars flying is no longer exciting... the stars! But bro remember to keep healthy.

2308501,0,t3_2lpncj,Maybe make an analogy with other addictive and harmful behaviour like smoking or drugs. You start with one and that feels good and you dont really see the harm in it. But before you know it youre hooked and doing it because abstaining makes you feel awful and you get all kinds of health problems from it. Explain that it is better to never start with a bad habit than having to get used to doing without. Also explain the harmful effects. Most common of those that I have seen on here are erectile disfunction inability to have a statisfactory sexlife with a partner acne changes in mood and demeanor and loss of confidence. When it comes to porn explain how these are real people and how objectifying and dehumanising them is not a good thing to do that he wouldnt like it if people did that to him. Im  and when I was about  my parents had a talk with me and explained some things about puberty and how there would be these urges and that it was important not to give in to them. I dont think that at that age it is out of bounds to as a parent say that certain behaviour is not allowed for your own good and that they will keep an eye on it. But it is important to show that it is not something they are doing out of strictness but from love and to keep the dialogue open. I dont think it should be a oneway street but something they can work on together as a family and that he also has a voice in this in looking for ways in which he can help take care everything goes well.There are practical things that can help as well such as not sleeping naked or not having access to internet in his own room.

2312533,0,t3_2lnpw4,Thanks for all the feedback guys.  The thing with the other girl is complicated.  She and I are still in touch she is also married with kids.  Just a couple times a year and never anything more than catching up on family news.  My wife and I never really had the same kind of fire for each other as I did with this girl.  We probably made some stupid decisions like getting married in the first place but have made the best of it.  We actually have a pretty good life all things considered.  But as I said...totally sexless.  And Im not sure that would change if I ever got my mojo back.  But thats not the reason Im here anyway because I really need to get my shit together regardless.   You have to nip that lamentation in the bud....  Now that there is funny!  This is not a bud its an oak tree with roots pushing up through the foundation.The reason I even brought her up is because when I look back on my life with this compulsion I see many key points where things might have turned out differently if I had a clear head and that is one of them.  But I also recognize as some of you said that there is a certain amount of grass is greener going on there.Anyway as I enter day three of my challenge I am reminded of how my brain works with this thing.  When the familiar cravings start to sneak in its not that I CANT control the urges its that I DONT WANT TO.  My brain is able to rationalize away the determination that I had the day before.  I sail off into the old habits with barely a second thought.  Then after a long Saturday afternoon PMO binge is over I think Oh yeah I promised myself I was going to stop this.  And it doesnt hurt that it feels friggin awesome. Ive never used any illegal drugs but I feel like I have an idea of what heroin feels like no offense to anyone who has really dealt with that.Cheers all stay healthy.,NoFap,clxjlys,1,t5_2skrn

Panicked and then pmod and have been stuck on streaks between  to  day streaks since this was about  months ago.Im telling you this to say that your focus should be on quitting porn thats it do not anticipate masturbation  do not plan for it if you get to  days and it happens do not make a big deal out of it do not make it a routine.

I was dealing with a bad case myself but i told myself that I have to learn new things or try something out of my comfort zone to appreciate life in a different aspect and thats when the fun begins. I write a plan of things that I want to do the night before  go hiking with my dog read a book fix one thing in the house that bothers me.

Its hard to find any net benefit in porn but masturbation alone being tied much more directly into the human body is harder to study.  Many people find masturbation physically andor mentally draining even when done without porn.  On the other hand there are some studies that correlate moderate masturbation with slight increase in prostate health.  It is noteworthy though that good diet and exercise far outweighs the supposed benefits found in said studies.

2381706,0,t3_2mnxzc,For those of you having problems with libido are you doing the basic things to balance your hormones? Maintaining your circadian rhythm A regular sleep schedule. Getting sunlight in the morning going to sleep at a decent hour and getting a solid  hours Being on your feet or at least in an strong upright posture while sitting throughout the day Strength training large muscle groups a few times a week Eating a diet with no deficiencies including enough calories and especially abundant in zinc cholesterol vitamin a Getting a half hour of sun a good portion on your body a day. If your vitamin D levels are abnormally low theres no way that your hormones can be balanced.There were a couple years where I was doing almost none of these while doing PMO usually daily. That is a deadly combo of bad habits which usually encourage each other. I wouldnt be surprised if the worst effect that PMO has is that it encourages you to neglect the basic things for good health which over time greatly decreases your metabolism and hormones. Even after removing PMO my libido didnt get better until I consistently did the basic things in this list.,NoFap,cm63536,9,t5_2skrn

2411343,0,t1_cm9qgbb,I agree. Its more important to listen to your body and follow what its telling you. Last week I relapsed on Tuesday but I had a date over the weekend so I decided to fastforward through nofap until then by edging once or twice a day until my date. By the time the weekend rolled around I was pretty much ready to fuck anything that moved and I had ridiculous confidence because of it Im talking like  month abstinence style superpowers.For that matter if you get to the brink of orgasm and have trouble not finishing that is your brains addiction pathways end up winning out over your conscious minds desire not to finish you probably have a lot more healing to do and edging may not be the best idea.

Lewis here is the quotation if it helps gtFor me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which in lawful use leads the individual out of himself to complete and correct his own personality in that of another and finally in children and even grandchildren and turns it back sends the man back into the prison of himself there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem once admitted works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible always subservient calls for no sacrifices or adjustments and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no real woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored always the perfect lover no demand is made on his unselfishness no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself.

Only then can there be the confidence and trust that allows the relationship to grow.  I have experienced this in my own marriage.

2503234,0,t3_2ns917,Day  Log cannot complain about my progress so far. I have self belief and have been resolute so far. I think this is partially to do with internalized self confidence as a result of living away from family and deciding I need to walk my own path. I am irreligious from a religious muslim family and deciding I want to live an irreligious life has solved some internal dilemmas. Part of that decision was the realization that I could stand on my own to feet and be happy independently it is likely my fam would hate me or partially disown me if they found out i turned my back on Islam. As you can clearly tell I have always had some deep issues that I have ran away from using pornography. This is no longer going to be the case. I wont rely on a virtual fantasy to make me feel good and escape Only for a moment before crashing into depression when hit with reality.

2577850,0,t1_cmv0267,Thanks I put a lot of time into it   With criticism identify whos criticizing you. There may be a particular personpeople or just a sense of they other people en masse inspecting you and about to see a flaw in your character. You may be feeling fear from the thought of them finding out about how you really are and seeing the repugnance of your filthy soul.  Mindfulness ExerciseStay with the feeling of being in the middle of being seen and criticized for a moment. Get to know that feeling. Let it arise and come over you and when it does stay open to it. Theres no need to resist it because this feeling is really just an ignored aspect of yourself. As long as you stay open the mind is automatically coping with it. Its doing its work on you. You may even choose to be vulnerable to it in which case you may find yourself erupting in laughter once youve gone through the feeling.  Fixing the Skewed IdentityThe sense of they comes from the separation of identity from the rest of the world yourself and other people. Everyone is susceptible to having this view of the world and most do. Nobody is above it. You feel it for a reason youre overlooking something very fundamental in how your identity is constructed. When youre a separate identity its you versus everyone else. Naturally you want to win but the odds arent in your favor with this kind of view. Youre easily outnumbered. The goal is to realize oneness of identity. See that they imagine a crowd of people looking at you any one of them would be feeling this same feeling of being found out if they thought of identity the same way you did. You just took a wrong turn somewhere along the way.I absolutely agree with NoFaps spiritual usefulness I may have even used those very words to describe it in a previous post.  ,NoFap,cmv2a7g,5,t5_2skrn

2581250,0,t1_cmvgq4e,No satan is mans interpretation of evil just like god is mans interpretation of good. He can say what he likes it doesnt say in the rules he cant i was just asking if he had to title posts like this because it excludes those who dont believe the same thing and it will drive people away who have a negative opinion of religion. Your comparison doesnt work at all. For one thing we are all doing NoFap so we are part of the same community we are not all christians so what your saying is completely different. When people make posts and briefly mention their beliefs it doesnt bother me because they are speaking of it in a way that says i believe it but i get others dont the way OP has worded it makes it sound like he doesnt believe but knows it as a fact.So again do what you all want within the rules but if members of the community start to leave and others dont even give it a try because of titles like this post which sends the message atheists and agnostics dont belong here then please continue,NoFap,cmvi8wl,-1,t5_2skrn

2590540,0,t1_cmwhy7j,Yeah I had that at the start too and even after a streak of multiple months I still gave in. Except I wouldnt call it giving in. Its always more a case of confusion. When you first start abstaining the idea is clear in your mind why you should hate porn how terrible it is as an addiction. As time goes on and we get into a rhythm we try like with all things to automate the battle. We dont want to spend all our time thinking about how we shouldnt fap so as we get overconfident we start to ignore it thinking our mind has it under control. Cant forget though were fighting our own mind. People here always say dont make noFap your whole life fill your life with other things. I think this is only really applicable later on after a few months when the brain has started to come to terms with its new base level and the mind has had sufficient fogfree time to really understand your addiction. At the start beating the addiction should be your life. Even later as it gets easier we cant forget what made us decide to quit on day one.,NoFap,cmwpy1f,1,t5_2skrn

If you dont and all she knows is that during sex you struggle to get an erection shes going to get the wrong idea. Im not saying shell break up with you but she will get the wrong idea. Considering youve been together a month and youre already having sex theres a strong chance shell just lose interest. Look its not like youre in a longterm relationship already its been a month. Tell her that while you were single you got into a bit of a porn habit and youre going to withdraw from it for the sake of your new relationship and explain to her why youve been having some boner issues and that there might be some time before they come back to normal. Unfortunately theres no way to speed this up or at least not so far as we know.

Not intrusive enough?Masturbating to porn regularly IS an addiction.Id be surprised if you could find many masturbation addicts who dont use any porn or stimulus of some kind. Porn leads to addiction and for most cutting the porn will cut the addiction.Dont try to justify that youre not an addict youre just lying to yourself and delaying your recovery.,NoFap,cn7kz8i,1,t5_2skrn

Do whatever you have to to stay away. Shower go out talk to someone no matter what happens keep away from porn. Install porn blocking software and tell someone to type in the password for you. Good luck!,NoFap,cn8d05r,1,t5_2skrn
2680489,0,t1_cn8f3d9,Oh thanks for all the details! That is definitely a motivation. I recently discovered I might have a form of PIED or performance anxiety or may be a combination of both. I would get hard making out with a girl I like but then everything stops when I am expected to perform. I also havent felt any sort of sexual desire at all although I have spent  days with her and have been PMO free for like a week before these  days. I am very sure it is a brain problem because the dopamine rush that I get as soon as I start looking for the artificial stimuli that excites me is enough to give me a raging boner. I am not having difficulty quitting porn but it seems like my brain is always trying to find out other artificial stimuli every time. This time whenever my brain resorts to one of its evil tricks I destroy the path to this stimulus altogether. Lets see how it goes. Thanks buddy and good luck with your journey.

As a single movement practice contracting and pulling upward the entire floor of your pelvis including the anus perineum and genitals. It should feel like you are trying to stop yourself from going to the bathroom. You can practice this in sets of  or  contractions holding them as long as you can. Kills boners.

If you still love him and he really wants to stop i think you should stay with him and support him though thats not for me to decide and you shouldnt push yourself to do so. Even if he will suppress his addiction theres no guarantee you will get back to beeing together one of you might find a new partner. Id suggest introducing him to this reddit and yourbrainonporn.comI myself have fallen many times even to a point that ive been shaking and feeling really cold all of a sudden after a relapse.

2794367,0,t1_cnkoyjg,Ive heard something similar.  There models of alcoholism treatment that I think have worked for some and I think they use this more in the UK and perhaps in Europe but its essentially a moderation approach that is very regimented so that people get constant reminders and only have access to a certain amount of alcohol at home so that they cant drink more than they would normally.  Its harder to do that with fapping probably but I think it can be done for some.  The other part of this is that while fapping can be compared to alcoholism in some ways the main dopamine release you get from it is something you also get from sex with another person so unless you abstain from that or just have no sexual partner youre going to be getting that hit occasionally whether you are fapping or not.  Its different in many ways but in many ways its the same  an orgasm via your sexual organ.  In some ways its even similar to overeating.  You cant NOT eat so you will always have some degree of exposure to that which addicts you although you can minimize it by trying to refrain from trigger foods that cause you to binge more than others...,NoFap,cnlpj9k,1,t5_2skrn

2808250,0,t3_2s8m5a,its tough...been trying about  months. nothing wrong with feeling shit about a relapse thats progress as far as im concerned. try to feel so shit about doing it that you never relapse within the first week. anything around a week or more is decent IMO...at least youre going sideways energetically if you keep Os spaced out like that. theres something in your mind giving you the urge...its about rooting it out. meditating is a great thing to do because you should be able to feel the energy causing you to keep fapping if you build a good practice. its always because of some type of negative emotional resonance that shouldnt be there be it frustration selfloathing worry etc. once you really know what it is it should feel worse and worse to PMO as the energy loosens up and eventually releases. my cents.,NoFap,cnnafom,1,t5_2skrn

I then proceed to objectify them by imagining the sexual things I would do to them.After NoFap I began to notice ALL women big small tall short etc. I began noticing things like demeanor and the way they carried themselves.

2894636,0,t3_2ta4dt,Loneliness just like many other unpleasant feelings in life comes and goes. I know its hard to handle and many of us experience what you feel routinely as well. Dont feel guilty or any less of a person because you are lonely. The emotion itself is your bodys way of signaling to you that a decision needs to be made through your actions. Either you accept your loneliness for what it is and embrace the challenge that comes with it for your own personal development or you succumb to another depression point in a long string of unpleasant feelings that will likely only temporarily alter your life. If you choose the latter youve essentially stop fighting for influence over your own emotions.Try to think beyond the existing negative emotion in your mind. Yes its difficult and uncomfortable but with time just like everyone else in life youll learn to manipulate the discomfort to your advantage.Have faith in the process and remember that there are many of us who are here for you.

Hiking is a great tool in the quest to reset your system.

2899263,0,t1_cnx53xx,So I told my wife I wanted to abstain for a little while.  She was busy and was unable to talk about it at the time.  But much to my shagrin when she was able to discuss it later the next day she didnt even mention it.  Really?  No questions about why or for how long?  Ok Im sure it will come up at some point.  After reading those articles Im not sure how long I will abstain from sex.  I think one thing Im looking for is really solid morning wood.  I think that would be a good sign.  Im seeing some morning wood but its really only partial.  Erections without fantasy would be another sign of progress.  I think Id like to wait until I can have solid erections with no fantasy before I have sex again.  I am I guess  days no PMO and I guess  only  days without entertainng any fantasy that occurs to me.  I dont know if its a good sign or a bad sign but Im already getting the headaches and runny nose.  I dont think I should take anything for it bc one time I took excedrine and I took like  or  extra strength bc my head was pounding anyway I stayed up like all night and jerked off like  times.  It wasnt even about porn.  It was like I could feel these waves coming and thats what I had to do.  I tried to find if there was some connection to the ingredients in excedrine that could explain thatit was bizarre.  Anyway that was a while ago so now I guess its just a shitty headace for me.

While you release your breath slowly contract your butthamstrings as hard as you can so that you feel like youre lifting up and keep it like that until you cant anymore and release it slowly.Hold your breath for  seconds.As a single movement practice contracting and pulling upward the entire floor of your pelvis including the anus perineum and genitals. It should feel like you are trying to stop yourself from going to the bathroom. You can practice this in sets of  or  contractions holding them as long as you can. Kills boners.

3053489,0,t3_2u7uc6,I really relate to this. Curiosity is the thing that Im now fighting in my brain that idle though that Why not just look at it and prove you have power over it? But I have to realize that I dont have power over it or my mind wouldnt be using curiosity as the bait.Really struggling with triggers these past few days. Been lured into exploring them because of my curiosity and have only luckily avoided relapsing to P or edging because of them. I feel like Im making up excuses for myself after I stupidly entertain a trigger for a little bit but I have to realize that that trigger leads nowhere good and that next time I know where it leads I know that it doesnt have power over me and I know that Ill get nothing out of it.Its actually weird but the damn triggers have been my problem on this current streak. The desire to actually sit down and MO to P hasnt really struck me as even conceivable these past  days but the idea of Oh why dont you just entertain the notion of looking at this and doing nothing else? has been digging into my brain. I think I am winning the fight but only barely but I need to do as you suggest and make a battle plan recognize what mental states make me do what I do and how I can easily avoid them even if that means whipping my phone against the wall seriously.I think my brain is equating NoFap with NoControl as seriously freaking out a bit about the notion that there are certain things about myself that I struggle with controlling. And instead of accepting that fact and learning techniques to control those things my brain is trying to tell me that Ive always had control and that PMO is a conscious decision every time which is a complete lie.Anyway thanks for sharing.

3073406,0,t3_2vd237,One of the main reasons I recently relapsed was due to the clinginess feeling I was starting to have with a new relationship.  I didnt want to reveal all my cards too soon as Im fully aware of the lack of interest that will soon follow so one of the justifications I made to myself was to just get off this nofap and unleash my pent up overdrive.  Because as I told myself it would make me relax a little bit and not want to think about her too much.I didnt want to be too intense with her too early on and even though we spent the week together and talked a lot I tried not to give too much of my insecurity over to her to handle.  I tried to rationalize my relapse as doing it for us since shes really into me and its just another sick game Im playing in my head.  Both ways are just about as distorted.I lost track of the reason I was doing this in the first place which was to literally reboot my system from decades of PMO and to try a new way out since my old one was just repeating mistakes.  So instead of carrying through with the reboot I set myself back two weeks and now here I am starting again.I do advise that you dont give in and instead focus on the reboot aspect of this as one of the supposed benefits is more inner calm and security.  All part of the game of self control.  Remember self control and self confidence go hand in hand.  And those traits are extremely attractive to the opposite sex.  So instead of going full on clinger mode just slow down and cultivate your nofap commitment and get ready to reap the rewards that come with long unbroken periods of self control. Remember how you felt right now when posting this then compare how you feel after  weeks.  Then a month.  Then  days and onward.  This will be the only way to see for yourself how your own mind and your insecurities are changing over time.  If you stop now...which Im not saying you are planning too you will never get the chance to reevaluate yourself from your new higher vantage point.This is a journey of self discovery.  And by rights you should have less feelings of neediness when you can discover things about yourself that lead you to rely on yourself more.  Because youve proven certain things to yourself.,NoFap,cogk1gw,5,t5_2skrn

3082031,0,t3_2vgmoa,Welcome!Ultimately Nofap is what you make of it. Set your own rules according to what you think is healthy for you.The difference between sex and nonporn masturbation is everything apart from your penis. Sex is a far more holistic experience with emotions warmth touch and smell. Masturbation is you pumping your fist like a robot.It really depends whether you are having trouble with sex. If youve lost sensitivity during sex due to deathgrip masturbating with a tight grip then refraining from masturbation is important in order to let you get more sensitive so you get more from real sex.If your sex life is totally fine and youre not masturbating excessively then you might just want to cut out the porn and go for rpornfree,NoFap,cohg8d2,1,t5_2skrn

3125960,0,t3_2vy1bl,I partially disagree with   nobody needs drugs or alcohol but psychedelic drugs may really help you to understand yourself and bring loads of positivity into your life. I started nofap and noporn after I got an impulse to do so during a psychedelic trip. I had all the information on how this habit may affect our reward circuit in a negative way I knew that after I PMO I feel sleepy lazy and my motivation to do anything is gone but that was only meaningless knowledge which I neglected. During the psychedelic experience I FELT and UNDERSTOOD how this shit is destroying me which was tacit knowledge which I couldnt precisely conceptualize with words.

3134644,0,t1_comvetc,I agree to me religious and having a certain faith and what you believe in are two different things. For example Im Christian because of what I believe and what Ive experiencedbut I do not consider myself religious. Im not interested in the traditions made up by man that are not even in the bible or excluding people or thinking theres only one way to do everything or that one sin is greater than another. Sometimes people pick and choose things out of the bible so its totally out of context and exploit it and miss the whole point I am not like that. That is not being a good Christian. I am sure other faiths and beliefs have the same issue and there are those who would need a different option than religiousme included. So adding another option would be great. Spiritual is right on the nose.,NoFap,comwiu8,5,t5_2skrn
3135917,0,t3_2w2cde,Really? Global capitalism? Porn being human torture? Im all about not watching porn as much as the next guy but this is ludicrous. These are consenting willing adults we are talking about that choose to employ their body in sex for the exchange of money and fame. Feminists dont like this because if men have porn they will not chase after women as hard as they did before they can just sit at home and jerk it off to literal s and s. Thus they lose power as a women collective same as prostitution  so the narrative is not just a feminist one but now its a Marxist one in order to fight global capitalism. They had to try and legitimize this somehow.It doesnt take much beyond reading ...and the shaved pubic regionswhich cater to porns pedophiliaturn performers into pieces of plastic. to know that this article is completely overreaching. Seriously shaving your pubic hair is now considered a manifestation of pedophilia. Really? What about those passionate porn video sites where were shown a loving couple having foreplay and tender vanilla sex? Are they also pieces of plastic? To be fuckable means to conform to the porn culture to look hot be submissive and do what the man wants. So now rape culture is not enough for these people and they need to define porn culture as well which doesnt make sense as a definition since hot and submissive women were a hugely valued commodity for THOUSANDS of years before porn even existed. If you dont want to watch porn dont watch porn. Porn is the product of a society with low moral standards a broken family unit high riskseeking behavior and complete hedonistic indulgence but it is not the product of a society that tortures and dehumanizes women because of corporate culture and global capitalismTM and men are all evil pigs. Sex is and always will be a commodity and the moment the social controls on sex are relaxed women will jump in to take advantage of this as they have done so with porn in the past. Except that now they can have their money they can have their fame they can have all their attention and then when its all said and done  they can cry out IM A VICTIM I WAS ABUSED PORN IS DEGRADING and even attempt to have a reputation for moral decency after the fact.It is never enough for women. They can never quite stuff their plate full. There must always be a victim narrative in place. God forbid that women actually enjoy being dominated by a man in bed and having rough kinky sex the way our ancestors probably did.,NoFap,con194a,-1,t5_2skrn

You just need to join the rest of us on the journey of abstaining from pornography to the best of your ability and cutting back on masturbation. The  day goal is good but if you cant make it dont beat yourself up just keep trying your penis will return to normal and you will realize the overall benefits of quitting porn and at least reducing masturbation will be well worth it beyond just your dick. And dont listen to the folks insinuating that this is permanent. I watched porn regularly for  years until i was  which is when i had your problem and when I started down this path. My erections are back to being rock hard and Ive had the best sex of my life. You just cant rush it and worry about it everyday.

3237846,0,t3_2x7a9r,You need to indulge in activities that take ahold of your creative mind. This will fully distract you from wanting to masturbate or watch pornography. It is called sexual transmutation the process of converting sexual energy into energy that can be used for other areas of your life. Avoid playing video games or shows but you still can of course for recreational use and try to work on creative stuff like making music writing making art videos web designing etc. There is tons of art out there and I guarantee that one of them out of the millions fits your niche. You just need to get out there and find it. Once youve accomplished that resort to creativity and your mind will be distracted from your urges and you will be productive  all healthy for your mind and body. Realistically the consuming activities such as video games and television and others does stimulate your mind and distract you but you may get an empty feeling that sits in your body that may encourage you to want to masturbate  not out of your thoughts but simply out of physical urge. It is said that it is because as a man you have the desire to create whether it is physical through sex or through other activities that require creativity and sexual energy through transmutation. This is why men have such high drive to perform activities because testosterone is the driving force. Try to use it on useful things.The work does not necessarily have to be good although if you strive to do that  even better because it will motivate you to indulge in the activity even more however if it isnt good it wont matter too much as long as youre participating in the activity. ,NoFap,coxlyi2,3,t5_2skrn

3245183,0,t1_coy6ixi,I definitely agree with you and wasnt trying to invalidate your post.  I just didnt agree with the part where is said to ignore that porn and masturbation exist or act like its not out there.I think it is crucial not to dwell on it.  Definitely makes sense to me that it is not helpful to repress it either.  And by repress I mean to dont try to and deny that you have an urge.  Really examine the urge and see what it is telling you.  It is probably leftover from your old desire to engage in a destructive and worthless habit e.g. porn and masturbation.  When you realize this definitely dont dwell on it.  Realize that you have the power to say no.  You ARE NOT powerless to this addiction.  If you think you are powerless you will be powerless.  You are worthy of love and acceptance.  You are a worthwhile person.  You are loved.,NoFap,coyddjk,1,t5_2skrn

Obviously some medications for the pain of core self have different rates and kinds of destruction.  The medication is not the addiction.  When you look at the source of any and all addictions its abandonment trauma.  As an infant the strategy was it cant be their fault it HAS to be mine.   So a PMO addict then believes he just has to stop using conclude that everything is his fault instead of the reality that he didnt cause nor can he control the addictionget a good rewire and then look for a female to fill the gaping hole in self.  Self esteem bankruptcy frozen development in infancyvery young childhood is the wound...building self esteem is the solution.  That takes coming out of hiding staying clean grieving as deep as the wound taking it one day at a time and lots of community.  Addiction is a systemic family illness and its dealt with by growing up and leaving home.  Dealing with the codependency.  Theres a lot of addiction stuff out there and some earlier icons who dug the road.  PMO addiction and the wiring reset information is AMAZING.  Were learning new things constantly.

3364430,0,t3_2yplqt,Im glad you reset so early in your streak because the idea here is to stop masturbating with the goal of only have sex with a real live woman IMO your wife.  You want to substitute the reward dopamine that you get with selfgratification with the reward from making beautiful passionate love to your wife.  Porn does not help because we get a dopamine rush just by looking at it and allowing it to get us aroused our brain thinks our body is going to have sex.  Porn leads to masturbation for most of us here me included.  Thats why we often say if you PMO porn masturbation orgasm you need to reset.  I would say MO is also a reason to reset because your goal is to O PIV only at least that is my goal.,NoFap,cpbrqqf,1,t5_2skrn

3371222,0,t3_2ysm4d, No. Never happened. May I suggest something? If you guys live together then whenever you get such thoughts go and hug her. As tight as possible. Tell her you love her. Shes the one for you. And etc. Its not always about doing sex. Focus on love. And lust will get away forever. Do special things for her. The skies the limit here. Maybe someday you can come early from work and get a few scented candles and have candle light dinnerLearn to make her something good!. So my point is the lust for others will always look small when true love comes its way. Thats how I fight about not fantasizing about my own girlfriendYa imagine how hard that is.. I dont really like doing it.So you see make her feel special. Theres nothing love cant do. So do it. And see the magic.I really hope it was of some use to you.

One of them was learning self development through reading and mostly videos on youtube while I work or study. I stopped watching tv and playing videos games which numb the brain...and then its really easy to go into auto pilot and relapse. So anyway to get your mind off it just feed your mind good information educate yourself on life self discipline make it a study.

3483146,0,t1_cpp93xx,Thanks so much for the advice. Im  years old this is actually the first time in my life Ive discussed this addiction with anyone. Ive always been a very strong and independent person so being the one to open up has always been something Ive never had the courage to do. I read an article just earlier today about addiction to porn and how it has done so much to harm my generation. I know I am better than my addiction and I deserve to do this for myself and quit. I want to quit more than anything else in this world. Because I know how much better my life could be. Last time it happened was at the very beginning of this new year. I committed myself to quitting and told myself this would be the year that I end all ties to pornography. I made it about  days until I relapsed. It wasnt so much as I just couldnt avoid it but more like I just needed to stimulus. I think the hardest part about this addiction and probably like most other addictions is that you just crave the feeling of it. You know that porn leads to masturbation and masturbation leads to orgasm. Its that feeling of orgasm that is so hard to steer away from. I guess because over the past  years its become my main way of feeling good. But at the same time its ruined my ability to feel good without it. Its been such a destructive and desensitizing cycle.My iPad has been my biggest fault for porn. Its so easy to get on it and go right to porn. Ive thought many times about how I need to just get rid of my iPad. I think that would be a good start?,NoFap,cppayaf,1,t5_2skrn

3532760,0,t1_cpuj07a,I absolutely agree that loving the self is the first step in bettering ones self in any sense. What youre saying is very wise and  true. I think that you are more or less misunderstanding where I am because I havent given enough context as to where I am emotionally.I do not need a girl or anyone to feel whole. I also dont need anything to feel whole. I want to flirt and have fun! Its not about feeling whole Im perfectly fine by myself I havent been on a date in six years because I chose to be by myself. Not because I felt incapable of getting a date.  I feel good about myself Im in school Ive got my own apartment after years of living with my mom and Im applying for new jobs. I also am a musician and spent a lot of that time alone playing music and honing my craft. I even went through a period of time about five years ago where I had to sell all of my instruments and I got really depressed. I learned that I didnt need music to feel whole or to define who I am. Though I still identify as a musician I do not need music to make me content anymore. I am just content to be alive and to be bettering myself every day. Being single doesnt make me feel lonely or sad like it did at one point in my life. The fact that the girl that I was talking about didnt get back to me didnt make me feel sad I was just being persistent. It really just felt like we had good chemistry when we hung out. You have to consider that someone who hasnt been on a date in six years is going to be a little rusty.  I am starting to get the hang of when to take a hint though. I dont think of my life in terms of success or failure. I see every rejection as a dodged bullet. Ive seen so many people miserable with each other because they got lucky one time with each other and didnt really have to work for a relationship by being rejected over and over. Im so glad that I didnt get myself into some shitty relationship that might have ended in a very ugly divorce because I didnt spend enough time to get to know or love myself. I havent spent these last six years pining to be in relationship. Ive spent them learning what I want from life. As far as Im concerned rejection isnt a reflection on me. Instead its a person really being honest about what they want and saving us both a lot of time and trouble. Thanks a whole lot for your very thoughtful and kind response! You also seem like a very nice person.,NoFap,cpuyisi,1,t5_2skrn

3556200,0,t1_cpxdvp1,The only reason there is a precedent for needing to take steroids to compete in pro sports is because a precedent was set by a few who did take steroids and their athleticism was pushed to the next level and their medals awards records and achievements were set and now very difficult to beat without the use of steroids or PEDs. Simple. As. That. Now we are faced with only one option create leagues that are using steroids and leagues that are not. Or... everyone can realize that steroids are not cheating once they actually do the research and study on them and we can legalize them and regulate them and make sure we remain safe while using them and then we can all just shut the fuck up. And get back to enjoying life. Whoever says steroids are cheating automatically puts themselves out there as an individual who is uneducated ignorant and sometimes plain stupid. Steroids are just like eating food and drinking water. They enhance what we do through dosing protocols etc. As an example take a bodybuilder. Give him steroids and no food he will never progress and eventually die. Now take a bodybuilder and give him food as much as he needs whenever he needs and given the correct amount of macronutrients and caloric intake to create an anabolic environment he will grow. He will progress in his sport of bodybuilding without steroids. Now give that bodybuilder both steroids which makes his eating more efficient his workouts more intense and his recovery time decreased and repair to tissue breakdown increased. So how is that cheating? Where does one draw the line with cheating? Because the guy who eats  meals a day of perfect food for his bodybuilding goals is going to go much further than the guy who eats three meals Much much further... Well then the argument arises steroids are not food food is grown in the ground. Ok well steroids are too they are synthesized in a lab much like how creatine whey protein vitamins minerals and preworkouts are synthesized in a lab. You could never get an equivalent amount of efficiently used creatine into the body from food as you could through creating a pure creatine synthesized from meats. You have now just enhanced yourself by artificial means. Same goes for all vitamins and minerals and ALL supplements. All of them. Steroids are synthesized specifically testosterone from yams... Yams. A potato. So where do people draw the line. Calling something cheating It is pure ignorance. ,NoFap,cpxmpsm,0,t5_2skrn

But It has brought me to the place where I realised that all that I need right now can be found in my friends. Also being a christian I turn to god for help on this as well. I find that reading my bible helps alot. A specific story that helped me out was the story of ruth and boaz found in the book of ruth. This story can be helpful to non christians as well. When I read my bible my thoughts just align and I begin to feel better. I also cry out to godsilently of course though I still yell and scream in my head sometimes to help take away my loneliness. When it is late at night I recommend going to bed or watching tv shows. I specifically like non narrative based shows like top gear or future weapons because Im not watching fictional characters interacting. Instead Im watching someone presenting to the cameras and in turn me. I find that tv shows just provide a great distraction from my lonliness.,NoFap,cq3pnou,2,t5_2skrn

The real worth or benefit or harm of a behavior must be looked at in the long run... not just a short window involving a brief bit of happiness and selfgratification. Those of use who both have and have not used porn can see the reality of it all. Sure for some there is no harm and no issues. But for a huge number porn has in fact caused major issues. Consider that the OP posted in NOFAP... a very legitimate place to express his opinion.  And note... for must of us here... we feel sorry for the original JPG poster.

You need to understand that spite a bit more me thinks.   All of the answers on this page are good.  Get highly educated  Understand this will take time and is hard work  Think of saving yourself for your wife as honoring your wife your relationship with her and yourself. All three deserve this.  Sex is not about just getting off fantasy or perfection it is about intimate moments of connection between to imperfect humans. okay some good fantasy between the two of you every now and then is still good fun at times!. Porn teaches us that sex is about ultimate fantasies and perfect bodies.  Your desires to use porn or see woman as sex objects will diminish...but will probably not go away completely.

3663355,0,t1_cq9stz5,Excellent article.  Thanks. This is the distinction.  Youve defined addiction.ExcerptAnd heres where shame is different from guilt. Guilt is focused on us not on our actions. Guilt can be triggered by our actions but we go from thinking that weve done something bad to thinking that we ourselves are bad. The bad thing we did is seen as proof that we have a bad self  perhaps even an essentially bad self. Guilt is a form of selfhatred. So while shame and guilt may seem similar theyre actually opposites.,NoFap,cq9uik2,1,t5_2skrn

3746568,0,t3_3399hg,It sounds like based on the formal psychiatric definition in DSM you meet the definition of a hebephile rather than a pedophile.  Check out Yuill and Rind Hebephilia as Mental Disorder? A Historical CrossCultural Sociological CrossSpecies NonClinical Empirical and Evolutionary Review Archives of Sexual Behavior Vol iv Aug .  As the article discusses adult male feelings of sexual attraction towards girls who have begun their sexual development usually around ages  is well grounded in human biology and history as in the range of normal sexual attractions and preferences.  Throughout nearly all of human history a girl reaching puberty has been regarded as ready for marriage and sexually available for procreation.  It only makes sense and is perfectly normal that after centuries upon centuries that certain men have evolved to find the early stages of sexual development in girls to be sexually attractive.  It is a extremely recently societal development in Western cultures and those influenced by Western cultures that we have now postponed the timeframe for marriage and the age of consent until age  so that a girls emotional maturity has the opportunity to catch up to her sexual development.   Teenage girls are also afforded the opportunity to prioritize education over child rearing.  This is a very good social policy that I support as a matter of basic human rights but it is unconscionable how we demonize men who have done nothing wrong simply for their having acknowledged these biologically evolved desires but have not acted on them.  It keeps these men from getting professional help and community support and in my opinion makes sexual acting out more likely. While the attraction may be biologically normal I also get the sense from your post of a certain psychological and emotional stuckness and acting out through the use of these photos from a place of shame and selfhatred.  It makes perfect sense.  That is what society has taught you.  But you dont have to believe it.  I recommend you check out the video on pedophilia by Teal Swan on YouTube.  Definitely eyeopening for me in terms of exposing my own judgments of pedophiles.  As I mentioned before it sounds like you have hebephilia rather than pedophillia but I think her basic message still applies.  Her video is incredibly compassionate and insightful about how these types of compulsions are often covering up a desperate cry help to recover the innocence of a lost childhood.  NoFap could be a very powerful way to get at these underlying emotions by taking away your escape valve but I would also encourage you not to rely solely on NoFap or message boards but to seek out professional support.  As Teal Swan recommends in the video a somatic experiencing therapist could be especially beneficial.I wish you well in finding comfort and selfacceptance.,NoFap,cqjc1cr,5,t5_2skrn

You havent been doing this long so take it from the veteransif you can get a hold of yourself now no pun intended you are already a step closer to a fun interesting and fulfilling life. You need to ask yourself what you value moremaking yourself into your ideal version of you from a young age or jerking off to porn for a fleeting satisfaction. Eventually itll stop being fun and youll have to seek out crazier and crazier stuff to be satisfied. Ya dont wanna be that guy trust me Ive been that guy. Managed to fuck up every chance I had with girls throughout my teens now here I am without a single female friend in my life. But thats ok cause if one young un like yourself manages to lead the life plenty of us here never could then all the bullshit is worth.Now as for actually not fapping most guys here are gonna tell you the same thing and my advice is no different. Its tried and tested shit. Do whatever you can to occupy your mind usually people suggest things like exercise meditation etc etc and those are all great things but youre ultimately gonna have to unearth your own passions you want to pursue. For me its cooking. You cant jerk off if youre too busy living life.Do your best to be social youll be amazed how well a lot of people respond to you just making the effort. Pursue other hobbies like reading or friggin white water rafting whatever floats your boat sorry bout the puns. Just breath life in. Do not expect to succeed the first second or even tenth time. Just give it your all. Thats really the only thing anyone here can do. And the most underrated advice anyone here can get? Dont watch porn and fap.Bam thats me done.

3780365,0,t1_cqn0kt0,Thanks fapstronaut! I admire your good intentions and would have agreed with you but have you seen the movie The Matrix ?Do you believe ? I have started believing and now I can enjoy things normal people cant. And I actually feel good talking about it. I take it as a challenge to cleave out my insecurities one by one. For example here is a pointer When I fap  I found that if I mistake sex or fap for dependency or love in my conscious or subconscious mind  that is if I related to the girl I am fapping to emotionally I will organism. Organism is a way of the subconscious mind offering your essence of love to the woman you are focused on. Here Love is a weakness. But if I just do it for admiring and absorbing her beauty into my system so I can have her carnal knowledge inside me I tend to not organism.In short if you take the redpill that is remove the thinking that women are angels made available in the world to save you and remove all dependency and need for a girl to feel good about yourself you will become the hero every woman deserves. Use them for what they are beautiful people. Not something to support you just beautiful independent people whom you can savor and then let go. Lol I am feeling good.,NoFap,cqn6tg2,1,t5_2skrn

3849009,0,t3_34ioib,Two years ago I discovered  ED when I tried to have sex with the most wonderful woman I know whom Im in love with. Then I was lucky to find the YBOP websites and started nofap immediately. After One Year nofap I had recovered a lot. The ED problem was much better and I could have sex. The recovering started from nofap day . After  days I started to get morning woods  a lot stronger then ever in my life. Now I have been exercising  nofap for two years. Ive had some relapses but by the time I start to loose my addiction to fapping and porn. Two years ago and earlier I could use  hours  or  days every week to seek for better and better images of butts on the web. This kind of addiction has taken a lot of time to get rid of. Not just that I am able to stay off porn and masturbation but to make this new life  kind of normal  that takes a lot of time. To get used to the thought that I shall not relapse but continue the nofapping life at least  days takes a lot of time to understand. Now the physicalpsycological reasons and motivation to nofap is much bigger then the moral. But still i think its hard to stay in  this hardmode nofap journey.

Maybe not NetNanny since even the name sounds naggy.Ive played with that K Web Protection because its free and made by Blue Coat they make business content filtering software which Ive seen used in big companies so I know they arent just some flyby company.  It looked straightforward.  Im about to play with the Android app to see how it does.  With any of them youd have the other person set it up so they could put a password on the software if it needs to be uninstalled and their email information so it emails them reports.If I was in a relationship and this conversation came up Id appreciate the sincerity of my partner and participate.  It sounds constructive more than continually talking about it as some unsolvable problem.  Guys like solutions.  if you suggest it give him some time to let it soak in.  You two obviously care about each other edit ks Android app doesnt work for me.  I know their Windows software does.  I emailed their support with a list of things that didnt work and the features Id expect.CovenantEyes probably works but its a subscription svc and I couldnt go through the install wo an account.

3900107,0,t3_3546mm,Youre over thinking this. What is your goal here? Do you want to be free of porn and fapping? It sounds like you dont want to get rid of it like you really dont want to change. If there is still a thought in your mind that your stash may be usefulhelpful at some point youre not totally committed to this. If you want success here  and in your life  you have one choice delete it. If you need to format the drive. It is only when you have burned your bridges that you can start to move forward. So long as the comfortable past is there to return to when things get difficult and they will youll always go back. And just deleting your collection is not going to fix your addiction it wont even fix your addiction to your pictures. You need to stop the fapping altogether. Once your brain starts to clear up youll get a clearer picture until then you need to have one goal stop the PMO.Once you start getting over this everything is going to change. Your outlook on life on women relationships. Porn taints everything. Youll find out that there are much better ways to become a confident man like working out hobbies accomplishing things women tend to like those things too much more than a porn stash. Much more impressive. You need the full reboot to dewire then rewire your brain properly. Ive got OCD and severe anxiety too and I find porn make everything worse after a fap session I get paranoid and afraid anxious about everything. Ask yourself what your goal is. Do you want to live a better life? Get rid of this habit? Then your answer should be clear. If there is any ambiguity you need to reevaluate your priorities in life.,NoFap,cr0uh9t,2,t5_2skrn

3996035,0,t3_368uyr,Hahaha I watched From Dusk til Dawn without knowing anything about it. That was an experience to say the least. In all serious though I think youre in the right path. Youre experiencing withdrawals because youve inadvertently trained your brain to mostly be aroused through porn. Theres a lot of science behind it that I wont get into but resources are available. Anyways when youre brain isnt getting dopamine through pornography it starts looking for it elsewhere. Itll subside over time but if you keep feeding it porn whenever your horny to solve your sexual frustration problems you wont see any difference. I recommend maybe going  days without PMO entirely because youll notice significant results. If thats not where youre at right now thats also okay but maybe just cut out the porn at least. Hope that makes sense. Its good that your setting goals but you have to make a concrete decision on what you want in order to maintain that decision after the mood in which you made it has passed. ,NoFap,crbs4mz,1,t5_2skrn

4019682,0,t3_36iv8u,Older long term married man here.  Came to NoFap by accident.  Had a  day streak.  Binged and then started again.  Came because of ED and DE delayed ejaculation issues and was looking a porn and masturbating off and on.  Wanted to give up PMO altogether and heal from ED and DE.  Giving up the porn was harder than giving up M.  I have looked at some porn along the way and edged but not MOd.  My wife and I have had regular sexual intercourse the whole time.  It took until about  days ago that I was able to stop all dabbling with porn and edging.  At that time my wife was gone for a week and she wanted me to be faithful while she was gone No P no M no O.  I promised I would do it and I did.  It seemed to change things for me.  From then on I have focused all my sexual desires towards being with her only.  I have upped the romance in our marriage we go out we go to concerts we listen to music and dance at home home dinners by candlelight etc.  Our kids are grown and married we have grandchildren so we have sex whenever the time is right no Viagra or Cialis needed.  I have come to the understanding that giving myself to my wife emotionally intellectually spiritually and physically has made all the difference.  Since I have real intimacy with her in all these areas and I have been more honest with her it has made all the difference.  Strange thing we have more satisfying sex than ever even though we are older.  My ED is gone.  I still experience DE from time to time but I dont care because I still enjoy having sex with my wife.  I believe that will get better too.  Hope this helps.,NoFap,creh32c,3,t5_2skrn

So when youre starting out its okay to visit NoFap as many times as possible and read up on the success stories for motivation. However as your streak progresses eventually reduce the frequency of your visit of this subreddit. This is because youre gonna start experiencing the emotional problems that PMO have been shielding you from. You need to deal with these problems. If youre visiting this subreddit all the time youre gonna centralizing your life around NoFap and thats not the point. NoFap is supposed to be the catalyst for the new you. Your selfimprovement is what you should be focusing on. Sure its great to read success stories once in a while as a pick me up. But try to not do that so often. ,NoFap,crfzftf,1,t5_2skrn

4037963,0,t1_crgib9x,I think another part of this may be that when you tell someone you already get the gratification or reward from their response so you may become less likely to actually follow through with whatever it is. For example if I start lifting I could wait a few months for people to notice and feel really good when they do. Or if I tell them upfront yeah Im going to the gym they say nice job dude and since Ive already gotten the positive response its easier for my brain to trick me into not actually having to go lift. I never took a psychology course though so this could be total bullshit but its been my experience. ,NoFap,crgk414,1,t5_2skrn

Its incredibly difficult to just tone down masturbation. To me its far easier not to masturbate at all than to limit it I tried that too and failed badly.Just see how it goes.In a way I learned to enjoy those urges I get... or rather...

You cant avoid sex with your girlfriend thats one of the key reason to your journey in Nofap like you said.Cant you have sex with her every time you have a urge? Or most of the times? Those urges are related to porn? Do you feel damaged if you fap thinking about your real sex life? Do you think that this affects your sex with her?

4144422,0,t1_crrrm4b,Where do you get the idea that this sub has anything to do with removing porn from the planet hating it judging others for using it or demonizing it? Thats NOT AT ALL what this sub is about. Its about personal improvement and removing and addiction from OUR lives thats making our lives unmanageable. Go read the about section of www.NoFap.com for its true purpose. Just a thing or two about addictionWhen it comes to addiction of any kind the idea is to break the addiction cycle first  reach a level of sustainable living without it  then tackle the underlying issues when the addiction is no longer a focal point in a persons life. the last  could conceivably be done simultaneously with proper counselling.While there are likely other issues at the root of the problem they cant really be effectively dealt with until the addiction has been arrested. Being purposefully redundant here The freed up time one gains when not actively engaging in the addiction can then be used to focused on other issues. Typically once the addiction cycle is broken an individual is better equipped to tackle the other issues.So in order to break the pornmasturbation cycle it is definitely necessary to  abstain from porn and optionally abstain from masturbation based on ones goals. Some of the reasons you are here are quite different from others.To make a proclamation that you think its all about toxic shame representing the majority of the group is very myopic. There are vast number of other reasons people are here. Porn addiction in and of itself barring other factors can make one feel shameful. Same goes with drugs or video games or any activity that is selfish selfcentered wastes incredible amount of time andor makes ones life unmanageable I would dare say that many people would publicly associate their porn usage with with the words pride and accomplishment.Next time you post something like this refrain from using any form of the word WE when speaking about yourself.Any form of the first person I is much more appropriate for your opinion.,NoFap,crsoj6x,2,t5_2skrn

It can be used to brag it can be used to reach a milestone. Its just there. Success can be measured by the counter but who is really seeing that success? People can make posts about what they have done with their  days since they started  hey good for them but we can only take their word for it. Success may come but the counter doesnt give it to you you have to make your own success.I dont want to rain on your parade here keeping track of such progress may be very useful but having it all managed here can be hard. Some people will say that cold showers should be worth xp while others will say its not. I think that it will make the whole thing too complex and hard to manage and just keep track of personally. I just think that its just not quite practical here and that our own success should be done not by points. It would be like saying Im a lvl  son because I just worked in the garden and cleared the house. Does it make me a good son to do those things...well I guess it helps but we already know what value it has  and trying to assign a point value to it seems kind of impractical.,NoFap,crxha8k,1,t5_2skrn

4220137,0,t3_398iu3,Hi Nathan appreciate your post and blog. I can identify with the idea of not actually struggling with lust but rather letting it be part of me. Until very recently about three weeks ago I had never told anyone I knew about my long time struggles. I took courage and confessed to my best Christian female friend after experiencing several nudges from God about doing it. The last three weeks have been hard and Ive been much more determined to staying strong and  trying to seek Gods help through it. Alas today I relapsed and feel like a failure once again. But Ill take my armor back on and dont fall back into the same traps again  praying that I too can by the grace of God overcome this sin.Will be following your blog,NoFap,cs1a088,2,t5_2skrn
4221935,0,t3_3993ao,Good for you man! Its always invigorating to get a clear concise view of what you really want down deep after not realizing it for a while.I will say however that the relationship or bust approach is not for everybody. Not saying Im against it but its definitely something that requires background into circumstance to understand which part of the spectrum a person would be on.Im kind of in the middle for example. Ive only ever been intimate with one person. Started off as a hookup a few times thing. I thought it had a slight chance to go farther. Dont think it will. Im fine with that.Would I prefer a relationship to a sexbased arrangement without feelings? Of course. However Im not really in a situation where I think a relationship is the best plan. Its certainly an option but Id rather wait. In the meantime I might get a dry spell I might hookup with somebody maybe even a FWB arrangement. Im not sure but Im not slamming the table for any of the options while being open to each.I mean Id prefer to have my number be low and a relationship is the best way to do that plus Ive heard relationship sex is the best sex but again unless some crazy opportunity comes along I dont think its for me right now.Just trying to give you perspective on why some people might disagree with you.

The white knights run like hell to moms bedroom door and start spouting off about intimacy and control and relationship...blah blah.  But look where they are.  At moms bedroom door.  Thats what the control is for.  To be accepted by all women.  To use them as a moral compass.  They even call sexual compulsion sexual.  Is an obsese person hungry?   Are you aware of WHY a reward system gets hijacked?  The more you call sexual compulsion sexual the deeper the compulsion is driven into the reward circuit.  That shame is impossible to control.

4348975,0,t3_3atpzw,Much like anything in moderation I dont believe its inherently bad. The people who are here are here because its no longer something thats in moderation. It affects their lives negatively because they are taking it to the extreme and the only way to correct this is to stop doing it altogether. The NoFap experiment itself is a good exercise in selfcontrol. Abstaining from something that is so easy and free to do... and achieving that for a long period of time can translate well into other aspects of your life. This is where the superpowers and renewed focus come from. Again its not a bad thing to do unless its hurting you. Then you need to stop and reset. Depending on how bad you have it that reset could be weeks months or years or indefinitely. ,NoFap,csfv0w5,88,t5_2skrn

4465043,0,t1_cstf8fe,Skittish defensiveness which inevitably shows the simmering misogyny underneath. Did you hate the girls you fapped to jay jay? Did you call them skanks in your head? Is that what bothers you with this whole PMO business? That you were jerking off to skanks? This is so fucking typical. Dudes getting incredibly touchy about the horrible trials and tribulations of not touching their dicks. Then turning around and labelling the women they deem responsible for their addictions whores and skanks. Jerking off with one hand and pushing the performers away with the other. Thats what the majority of PMO users do. Maybe if you saw them as actual human beings youd forget about your suffering and realize that the whole industry is built on suffering. Of both women and men. Suffering from addiction and compulsion. Maybe if you saw women as women and knew what these women did to make it to the set and through a scene you wouldnt want to touch your dick ever again. Youd puke if you had any decency. No one is faulting you for your addiction and Im sure everyone wishes you recover. But that attitude demonizing the women you jerk off to or who turn you on? Dismissing my wifes honest assessment of porn addiction because you think shes a skank?  That is truly fucking pathetic.  ,NoFap,csthvmu,1,t5_2skrn

4465621,0,t1_cstdkxa,In response to the many altercations occurring on this post rather I would like to call it bickering since it most certainly doesnt benefit anyone here. I would just like to interject briefly to voice my own opinions on the matter. Now coming from a neutral standpoint I can fully understand both sides members of the nofap community who are battling against this addiction feel berated and attacked from the comments of your wife to you as a porn addict? and a fap addict sad pathetic etc. Only these comments towards you is felt as an indirect attack to many of the nofap community such as myself who was a little surprised and taken aback actually. Im not sure of youre state of mind during the time but Im sure it didnt feel good to hear that. Now it brings me to the other side of the group which are the nofap members who take these comments to continue their endeavors of abstinence of fapping and actually are empowered from the comments to get rid of the sad and pathetic stigma.My first point is that Id like to mention is a phrase Dont shoot the messenger. Its coming from your wife but we all know that what she mentions is something we all should be thinking as males who have an addiction towards porn and masturbating. We all know it but to be coming from someone other than yourself and from a woman at that is agonizing and this is something Im sure you understand they are attacking your wife so you do have a right to defend her and whatever though but this is why there is such a conflict between many of the conversations in this post. To continue from my point about the stigmas of masturbating and the overall image of males struggling through this addiction. And forgive my wall of text as Im sure it was already something mentioned or you might have known beforehand I just felt that it was significant enough for me to post. My actual point that I wanted to communicate is that despite the fact that I am a member of nofap that took your wifes criticism to elevate my desire to eliminate my addiction for porn and masturbation I dont see this entire community and men who are trapped in their addiction to masturbate to porn to be sad or pathetic. I believe that its incorrect to say that it is our fault yet when we allow ourselves to fall back into this routine of masturbating to porn to be our fault rather. Why? Because society has been advanced to a point where masturbating is natural and everybody does it. This is already evident in what you posted what your wife said I dont know. I guess everybody is supposed to be doing it so women dont necessarily want to come out and say it. As many of us here we started masturbating from a young age. Especially in this generation where the internet is so available and porn can be streamed for free on the web so easily. No difficulties in accessing it its there its high quality. Lack of information and knowledge develops into a relation where males starting from a young age and as they age it becomes a routine. Humans are habitual creatures this is evident in everything we do the way we stand walk sit drink eat. If you think changing the way you eat is easy stand drink sit etc is easy then you are wrong. As someone whos been exposed to the internet from a young age as many others Ive developed a habit of eating very quickly and sometimes I still do yet it is better to eat slow chew more etc. For men who have been in this cycle for many years it really is hard to break off from it. And not all men can have such a strong willpower and not all can change immediately and might take years or might take a few month.Im not trying to lecture you at all. Im sure and hope that youre aware of all of this information that Ive spit at you. I just feel that when you explained it to your wife that you should have explained it more clearly. And if she at that point still calls you indirectly us sad and pathetic then let it be but Im just going to say that although it has inspired you and myself I think it can have detrimental effects on others and something you should think about before posting. ,NoFap,cstkhoe,1,t5_2skrn

4467908,0,t3_3calbn,Mate relax. Recovery is long term process. I was hooked up to porn for more than  years. I really wanted to have sex with this girl but since I was a virgin I didnt whether I would be actually able to do it or not. Due to my performance anxiety my porn addiction and my flatline I blew it. It was really embarrassing. Within a month after that I was almost done with my flatline but I took the blue pills anyway since my mind was only able to register perfect girls on some screen but not in reality. We had sex it was okay okay. Both of us were virgins we didnt know any better so that kinda saved me. After a month around  days of my recovery I didnt require any pill to get it up started meditation to actually go in the state of nothingness I lost the anxiety. Now I can perform well even multiple times. Just know this recovery is not abstinence. Focus on your other personal goals. Go hit the gym  times a week. Eat clean work on your social skills. Embrace the flatline. Avoid all kinds of pornography and even nudity if possible. Make a list of things that you wanna achieve in life and make them so urgent that you dont have time for porn or some other form of distraction. Within sufficient time your ED will be gone and trust me it will be gone. Stay strong withdrawal of first few weeks will hit you hard but then itll get easier and eventually youll recover completely. Just keep pushing towards the best version of yourself. Good luck ,NoFap,cstut46,1,t5_2skrn

Then for whatever reasons unrelated to his partner the man starts heavily watching porn and develops an addiction.Maybe were talking past each other a little because of a semantic misunderstanding otherwise I have no idea how you can classify EVERY porn addiction situation the same way.

4493959,0,t1_cruhu5f,lol you are so right. the pendulum swings from raging hypersexism to sissy androgyny are kind of a litmus test for a recovering addict though. i myself have said these kinds of things and now regret them. its part of the journey to get evangelical about dumb lines just happy that i see more to women than their boobs thighs and other curvy curves .... i still go through these mental relapses where i feel guilty for appreciating a womans body parts ... when i should be happy and ruddy and excited that her this gets me hard or her that creates heat in my chestbut as you said their bodies are created and designed to excite attraction. im glad i like pornified women. it shows my instincts work. the problem is when i begin to fantasize or objectify without humanifying also instead of freakin going for it in reality ... or letting the details up to God. God and two friends of mine all three talked to me about giving my sexual desires up to God to meet them in his way and time. i think ima do that,NoFap,csx4f9r,1,t5_2skrn

4504335,0,t1_csyf0zk,Sure.  Notice how men are turned on immediately before even conscious thought by physical sexual cues.  Its an object oriented sexuality.  When a man has been shamed for that our societyfamilycouplesmediareference groups he believes that and directs it towards porn where its shameful...and dopamine spikes and hyperwires to shame.  Self disgust.  Low power.  Sometimes you even hear men actually saying Im done with seeing women as objects and am going to be better somehow not noticing as an example that there are no women here.   Sex then is feminized inside the man where he becomes even sicker and pledges love as the expression of his natural sexuality.  But its worse than that.  The man identified doing this will sometimes jump to Moms defence and start whiteknighting.  This usually ends up attracting feminists or women of low sexual value.  The main purpose is to castrate.  To please god women.  To avoid their wrath or win their approval.  This is called codependency toxic shame and is the bedrock of compulsive PMO.  All addictions are about toxic shame codependency.   As a culturefamily we usually soak in this.  Its normal.  Why else would PMO as a soother for the pain of a lost masculinity involve so many power imbalance themes?,NoFap,csyf8bu,3,t5_2skrn

It really does work. Its pretty mind blowing and Im used to that now.  Heres and example you can try yourself remember to give it time.. In order to see yourself as a man that women throw themselves at you have to visualize it I shit you not.  Try this just for fun say this affirmation throughout the day in the mirror Women ask me for their phone numbers everyday...Now visualize it happening before bed etc etc.. Keep doing these  things daily and watch if it doesnt start happeinig to you all the time.

4513178,0,t1_csy8bet,Its all about retraining your brain. The biggest mistake I think people make is trying to not think about it. Trying to avoid a thought just drives it in harder. Try to shift your consciousness towards picking those thoughts apart. go fromLook at that girl butt looks good probably feels good I want to blah blah blahAnd mindfully work towardsLook at that girl butt looks good probably feels good I want to. Wait. Why am I thinking these things? Yes who ever gets to have sex with that person probably enjoys those things people who know her as a person and are attracted to her may have these thoughts. But why am I? I dont know her Im objectifying her for being a woman in my line of sight. I shouldnt be wasting my thought process on this. See I really need to not PMO and break these lines of thought.And move towards that consciousness. Acknowledge the thoughttriggerstimulus and move past that initial reaction. Try to look at it objectively and examine it vsFuck me why am I such a piece of shit. This is so fucked up.

So you imagine  an illusion that deceives  the soul by deceiving the mind itself   its like a lie you tell yourself and you believe the devil to stimulate as if you were having intercourse with a woman  dor that only reason to chase the pleasure of an orgasm. However afterwards you feel empty and full of shame because you realize you were pretending and not really comnecting and giving your love to a person you actually care about. ,NoFap,cszjq9x,1,t5_2skrn

But what I would ask myself isIf you really have such a high sex drive and need to ejaculate so badly why cant you do it with a women. Are you really unable to find a women to satisfy your needs even younger there are . billion women on this earth?Also maybe you are not transmuting your sexual energy properly. You need to go ahead and use the energy you are building up. If you just sit and home it will be hard. Go out more. If you really have to fap twice a day to be able to concentrate something is not right. Btw being  is not a valid excuse for such horrible grammar.

So in the case you need someone you can write me a message if you dont want to thats ok with me it is your decision.It is hard to go through the deepest moments in your life and I know how it feels. For me bullying was the hardest part in my life I even thought about killing myself.Porn was a way for me to escape all that and what I realised through your post while you said that these people destroy you and dont even care is that the guys that bullied me are the same.These sort of people are no humans these are animals andI swear I wish that God puts them directly into hell because they dont even feel sorry for what they did to you.It is great that you are so a powerful person and that you talk to people. You have got great friends and family. Me personally no one helped but I am actually about to tell the entire story to my teacher that supported me over the years and I think and hope that this way of communication helps both of us.It is crazy that things like that happen just like that but you need to stay strong and life will get better I promise you that. Start small and grow it up. For me personally your story has a very high value and I want to say thank you for sharing it because it makes it even clearer to me to stop and never go back. I wish I could help you with more than these few sentences and if I can tell me what I maybe can help you with and I will try to do my best. You are very strong. Stronger than most people will ever be and I wish you the very best I can wish someone. I know that you maybe think that the took your humanity away maybe you are afraid of never feeling any emotions again but let me tell you that isnt true you are still very human and trust me you are going to get even more sensitive over time. Your emotions will come back mine did as well through one short hug my teacher gave me. It can be that easy even if I am not sure it this helps you but maybe it does.Stay who you are deep inside of you and never give up because you are a beautiful person.,NoFap,ctd938m,1,t5_2skrn

But that is likely not a large percentage.  They are most likely my opinion based on what I see and understand now practicing sexual repression.  This is based on toxic shame.   It would be like not using porn and masturbation to please your mother often unconscious.  Looking for loving relationships that are committed and disciplined by cutting off your own nuts to be a better man.  Thats spiritual bankruptcy.  The woman is a higher power.  Its very sick.  You have been unwilling to look at addiction so are left with the option of pulling your underwear up over your head and spanking your bum.  Alone.  Why would I write something like that to you?

4650930,0,t1_ctg6bt8,Yeh the crucial issue is the age at which exposure to the strong internet porn videos started. Thats what has rewired our brains in a really strange way to expect pleasures that real life sex cant match. I really admire the young guys who are here willing to take tough decisions to improve their lives. In a way they are lucky because in my teens all we had were crappy softcore magazines and very few of those so unrestricted access to all kinds of porn would have been a dream. But in another sense too much of a good thing is a problem because it creates a fantasy world that reality cant live up to.

Monks are right when they say meditation is a process that you get better at meditation has kept me sane to be honest haha and the technique I use is simply try to let go completely of any tension almost like your not your body anymore and at the same time focus on your breath but try not to focus to the point where your trying to breath get to a point where your breathing is happening on auto pilot and its as if your no longer the physical body but your just observing it thats what the rd person state is I was talking about.,NoFap,ctmqstb,1,t5_2skrn

Im enjoying the single life right now its no problem for me to be perfectly content without a warden er....girlfriend.    I used to be sad that my friends all had girlfriends longterm ones back to back to back to back to back while I remained single the whole time. And Ive had only two that I can say were real but even then they lasted no more than one month each. But that doesnt mean Im any less happy ever! In fact I enjoy life way more than any of my friends right now and I know this to be  percent true because I make it that way.     Dont ever let your feelings of good or bad be based off of other people. Youre a free man who can do as he pleases as am I. Im sure youre a very nice guy so use that to your advantage and go talk to any girl you want to. Even if theyre mega hot just go in there cool no hitting on them because theyre used to that. Be yourself BUT get their number before you leave them. Set it up in your phone for a new contact and then just put it in their hands.

4873872,0,t1_cu6zvaw,gtThis is not true. The issue is the compulsion.Compulsive MASTURBATION is the problem. All you had to do was add the adjective. The original comment is correct because anytime you masturbate it will result in you having less motivation and even less if its a compulsion. So saying this is not true to a perfectly fine comment is baseless and incorrect.gtMasturbation stopped or started or continued WITHOUT the compulsion factor is totally inert.I disagree. If you dont compulsively masturbate but still do it irregularly that still has an effect on your motivation WHEN YOU DO IT.

After a week and a half of Nofap I find I have the energy and enthusiasm to accomplish anything despite needing only   hours of sleep. As far as the how I have found using a web filter and a chastity cage to be the most effective means. The thing is thats no way to live. I mean after a month abstinence I often feel a great heaviness in my chest and a strange uncomfortable yearning like a scratch I cannot itch. Beyond a month Im very aggressive with people and hyper aware of social hierarchys while in a constant sexual haze.

The head monk says We have been copying from the copies for centuries but you make a good point my son.So he goes down into the cellar with one of the copies to check it against the original. Hours later nobody has seen him. So one of the monks goes downstairs to look for him.

Although making it a coping mechanism CAN create a lot of problems for a person speaking from personal experience because PMO is just so damn sweet that you rather do IT then go out a socialize work out or find a girlfriend... All of that can leave a person PMOing a lot but with a very empty miserable life. For me all that NoFap really did was to make me take away a huge coping mechanism i.e. coping mechanism that allowed me to cope being a depressed  year old virgin living at his mom feeling bad about everything about him and therefore forced? me to learn how to cope with life by actually living it. Year and a half later I was engaged had a very muscular body living with my fiancee happy with the direction of my life..

I am not sure exactly happened to you but I had a similar experience in the grocery store today. I wont go into specifics but that arousal switch nearly got flipped on from one very fast glance. What I did was consciously try and not look at her. Also I worked on calming myself down and focusing my attention on something other than girls. I was very tempted to amp up the arousal but I just kept on telling myself that is not what I really want in life. After a short time the temptation died down and I just went back to my day.Check out Fight the New Drugs Fortify Program at www.Fortify program.org. They have a great course for beating porn.

Im biting the bullet and going for it all.  Ive found one problem is getting overconfident.   Taking it day by day.  Just watching porn is just as bad as PMO.  It just continues the desensitization.

But once in eighteen days is still very good for someone making a first go of it.  The first three weeks of no fapping or porn are the most difficult for most guys because they are fighting their urges for the first time and starting to erase longtime habits.Looking at this post and your others here I see that youre working out trust issues with him and it looks like he began nofap only after you confronted him about his porn habit.  No matter how much you try to help and encourage him he has to be the one who ultimately wants to make it happen. But I know youre both working through this together now and I hope he truly wants to succeed and is able to fully regain your trust.  Good luck to both of you.,NoFap,cv8pxft,2,t5_2skrn

5192895,0,t1_cvbvxfc,Thats not ad hominem. ad hominem is when you say your argument is invalid because you are stupid. I did not render your argument wrong by pointing out that your sources were invalid but generally news articles and tabloids are not good sources for information as the author typically tries to popscience something and use sensational language to draw readership click bait instead of describing what has happened objectively. The magnitude of benefits for eating boogers is still far smaller than eating fruits and vegetables.Stress is an objectively measurable endocrine thing not just a subjective sense of tension or unease. Solo masturbation to orgasm is not an effective stress reliever as you have already seen in my sources. Real stress relief means not kicking in those endocrine feedback loop that increases cortisol which over time when chronically elevated can contribute to a whole host of health issues particularly the metabolic and cardiovascular ones.If you only orgasmed once every few months and you already live a healthy low stress lifestyle I dont see how it would harm you in any significant or long lasting way.However sex would be even better than masturbation as a stress reliever as the oxytocin released from being physically and affectionately close with another person diminishes cortisol and oxytocin secretion happens independently of climax and does not diminish once the climax has occurred. The body does not build up a tolerance to it either. You dont get much of that from playing a meat fiddle solo in the shower.The addiction in their case is the chronic stressor but compared to masturbation both of their net impact on chronic stress is nil. Exercise relaxing meditation drinking tea on a regular basis are more likely to bring stress relief even subjectively and at a greater magnitude of effect than either smoking or masturbating.gtI also never said masturbation is only good for you and has no negative detriments.I didnt state that you said this either. I was only pointing out that the strawman you made of the argument against masturbation was equally made of straw as the strawman I presented for the sake of arguing that both extremes were dumb when I made the case that masturbation is neither good nor bad especially given all of the hard evidence. Apologies if my rhetoric was confusing.You state that its all just neurotransmitters but they are qualitatively different and not necessarily interchangeable. The ones you speak of in terms of affection for your child would be oxytocin which is not related to the endocrine domino effect caused by orgasm which tells the body slow down now.And to be honest if youre going to orgasm just once in a while to feel really really good you might as well just have sex with someone you love.,NoFap,cvbxrbl,1,t5_2skrn

5262103,0,t3_3n1dfy,I totally understand where youre coming from. I dont think the Seduction board is just about fucking any woman you can find though. Its more about developing yourself enough to have the confidence to approach women and bring them into your world.Some posts have an obvious PUA feeling to them but there are many other posts that are mainly focused on helping men become a more wellrounded individual. A lot of guys havent had much success meeting and having sex with women so its much easier for you to look down on something like this because youve at least been able to experience it for yourself to know what its like. I think the main thing is that most guys just want to know that they can attract women. Once guys dabble in seduction they realize that this is possible. Unfortunately most guys just give up when they feel like theyre unable to attract a woman. Its perfectly understandable for a guy to feel insecure when he sees everyone else attracting women while hes constantly alone.Thats why its best for certain guys to read the parts that apply to their situation and leave the rest alone. Too much material often does more harm than good. ,NoFap,cvkailv,6,t5_2skrn

5295879,0,t1_cvoji0o,Its also an issue with your androgen receptors and not necessarily testosterone. Androgen receptors are what actually utilize your testosterone for various tasks like muscle growth and other things. The problem is when your sexually depleted like from masturbation then your receptors take a break so to speak and thus it doesnt really matter whether or not you have high testosterone because youre not actually using it!Thats why I find it so odd that people think porn is evil but masturbation is absolutely fine! I agree its less damaging but certainly if youre squandering some of your potential as a man for that quick release it isnt very necessary either.I didnt think to save very many links when I spent time researching this but heres a fewslight triggers on this oneYeah I know some of the links might contradict each other slightly.. but its nofap and most of mainstream society doesnt seem to believe in a lot of this anyways.

5356796,0,t3_3odvji,I think that hardmode is necessary for at least the start of nofap.  Those that do soft mode try to not have too many orgasms in a row at first to let their body heal.  Maybe try spreading sex out more at first.But I think you have realized the biggest thing about real sex without a connection sex isnt that great.  Think about it if you are using a  stranger just for a means to get off isnt that essentially the same thing as masturbation?  I think people fall into a trap when they first start nofap  we want to have normal sex lives but we mistake normal sex life for having sex with as many people as possible.  To me this is counter productive because its the same mentally when watching porn the urge of watching many girls many different videos Remember its that novelty that caused the problem in the first place.  Many long time nofappers talk about real libido.  Basically once their brain heals from constant novelty they realize that urges from real libido feel differently from the ones we felt we had when we were addicted to porn.  I am not saying that you will never be able to have a sex life that includes multiple partners.  But i am saying that you may have to give yourself some time to heal first.  But I think you have realized something important.  if there is no connection then why have sex with that person in the first place.  Wait until its with someone you actually like.  Its always better when you know the person.,NoFap,cvwe3os,4,t5_2skrn

5368821,0,t3_3oiqqb,Well i think you should just chill on seeking pleasure for a bit.  Pleasureseeking is kind of an addiction in itself.  Commit yourself to a couple months of blandness.   And then like another poster said pleasure will pop up in places unexpected  in the middle of common activities a new clarity and joy can start to emerge simple things can become amazing.   But generally some uncomfortable withdrawal comes first.  Take heart that phase is not forever and its worthwhile to endure and pass through it.   Its a bit like quitting sugar  another good thing to do.   Were looking for sweet substitutes and craving for a bit.  But its best just to pass thru it.  If none of this is helpful  you know theres stuff like the runners high.   Im far away from recommending that tho not everybody is fit enough to just take up running long distances without risk of heart attack or ripped cartilege and varied injuries.,NoFap,cvxxdrk,1,t5_2skrn
5369045,0,t3_3ok1bt,I think when we are quitting PMO after several years of doing it we have to learn who we really are and what we really like sexually. Porn do effect and alter our preferences but I dont believe one can become gay if we have watched men having sex. I almost only watched women and men having sex and have developed a severe penis complex and I started to become aroused by the idea of women having sex with enormous penises. But I wasnt aroused by the penis or the men just the women taking that big D was the thrill. So I think if you do find the penis itself or men attractive it was probably a sexual preference that was there to begin with before porn came into your life. So I recommend talking to a professional about it a therapist maybe that are specialized in peoples sexlives. And if the preferences for other men do weaken during your reboot I might have been wrong and it was porn that effected you to develop that preference. Just be honest with yourself during your reboot and try to discover who you are outside of porn  Also thank you for sharing this.,NoFap,cvxyeva,0,t5_2skrn

5377373,0,t1_cvycd1d,Addictions cannot come about without fuel. Theyre a result of escaping something else in your life. You certainly become addicted to PMO but thats only once your mind connects the fact that it can cope by replacing something painful with something pleasurable. This pain is an invisible trigger and is what makes us desire porn out of seemingly nowhere. Ever get the urge to go PMO out of nowhere? Yeah its that. Its your subconscious mind.Addictions are essentially caretakers. We as individuals are all here because we feel that PMO has fucked up our lives. But if PMO was proven to be nonaddictive and not at all an issue NoFap wouldnt be a thing. Neither would porn addiction. Its a very real addiction much like any sort of substance abuse.You sound the same as me. I too was addicted since childhood and the older I got the more shame I started feeling from simply BEING ADDICTED but it extends beyond that. It can be really uncomfortable to think about but its can be worked through if you want to truly benefit from overcoming PMO addictions.,NoFap,cvz0qgu,1,t5_2skrn

First of all youll need to educate yourself to learn how to build a new mindset and new habits. To build your mindset the best advice I could give you is fake it till you make it. This really is a great headstart as you stop becoming lazy and falling on old habits and you start being conscious about your actions therefore molding them to your new you.There are plenty of books about this. I recommend No more Mr. Nice Guy by Robert A. Glover The rational male by Rollo Tomassi and The way of the peaceful warrior by Dan Millman. Each one of those will help you develop the habits you need specially the last one to become more conscious about life and therefore helping you fix your problems.Lastly I dont think the thing about lesbians is really a problem. All the porn I watched was also lesbic and I had no trouble developing new habits.PS You may find my last post useful as I talked about some mistakes I commited when I had already taken control of my habits.,NoFap,cvzaqpo,1,t5_2skrn

On average youd expect them to last a week or so. It can happen for a little longer weeks or a month or so but typically if a flatline is going that long it isnt a flatline... the issue is something bigger.Relapse wont help you Ive been there and done that many times. If youre lucky youll feel good for an hour maybe two. The regret and anxiety however will only creep back stronger with stronger urges. If there is a bigger issue going on remember that theres always people you can talk to. Finding someone you trust and letting them know how your feeling can make the journey easier if you can muster up the strength to talk about it.

5455488,0,t3_3prsrl,The triggers of adopting a new habit are not necessarily the same as the benefits of adopting that habit. I think if you adopted nofap due to triggers you are twice to five times more likely to experience no relapse and to appreciate its benefits.I began nofap  days ago long before I knew about the nofap movement. My nofap habit began as an experiment to understand why my twin brother cannot give up alcoholism despite its adverse effects.Since I had a hidden addiction to porn and masturbation I was the perfect experiment to understand why people struggle to give up harmful addiction like alcoholism. Weeks into the experiment memories of my breakup with my girlfriend came back. She broke up with me because I couldnt climax and ejaculate inside her. To her she believed she would struggle to get pregnant.It was during this time I came across the nofap movement and other studies that linked my inability to orgasm or ejaculate during penilevagina intercourse. I began to understand the link between my DE and my hidden addiction to PMO. I believe these two triggerstwin brothers alcohol addiction and girlfriend breakuphave strengthened my resolve to be pornfree and masturbationfree.,NoFap,cw8znud,2,t5_2skrn

I was sick of this as I read you post im starting to think you might be in the same place I was. What im about to suggest isnt easy takes a lot of courage and requires you to be honest with yourself. Make this real. Tell someone close to you. For me I decided to tell my mom and dad separately over the phone. I discussed my addiction with each of them mentioned I joined this group on reddit and mentioned how many guys struggle with the same thing im going through. I couldnt imagine how both of my parents reacted. They were so supportive and engaged in the conversation and I had no idea that they would be like that. My mom even asked if there are milestones for my journey and now she wants to take me out to dinner once I hit  days to celebrate lol. For some reason this streak feels different it feels like I have a weight lifted off my shoulders. Id recommend this to anyone if not a parent then a sibling or a close friend. If anything it will bring you closer to that person as well if youre feeling alone and empty. Keep your head up man its a journey and its not meant to be easy.,NoFap,cw9cubi,6,t5_2skrn

5471520,0,t3_3pzutq,First I was like Man if this is really a reflection of your old self you are kind of indebted towards your own old self to tell him about NoFap. You would have been really happy if someone would have done that for you. But then I thought about it a bit more. I still think it should be possible to somehow convey that information to him but then I have no idea who you are and who is he. We all have our problems it is always easy to give advices. If that guy doesnt really want to change his life telling him to get off porn probably the only real enjoyment in his life is like taking away his meaning of life. Addiction happens to someone for a reason. Explaining that porn is not the only thing worth living for is possible. But it takes enormous amount if energy and strength. You can do that when you have reached the point where personal development is not an option anymore. When helping others has become the only way of self development for yourself. In the end thats the only possible honest way to help someone. When altruism becomes egoism. But this is an extremely long way and only applicable for a very small minority. If your conscience is pure and you really feel like its not really possible to tell him about nofap then I believe you. Dont worry about the others. You have done great  months is awesome. All the critics should first do the same. But anyway very nice story. It really goes to show how an addiction can destroy ones life if not careful. According to Napoleon Hill if no sexual transmutation happens then beginning with  years man will get depressed and really sad. If it does happen and nofap is only a catalyst for that then a man becomes reborn at . His new life will start there. Good luck on your journey! Hope youll achieve this in your life. Try your best and make it happen! ,NoFap,cwb1dua,1,t5_2skrn

5494196,0,t3_3qarhg,I cant pretend to know anything about what is going on with the brainchemistry except the really basic stuff. But even though I dont have much recent data on the subject have had sex  times since NoFap I still think I can explain the difference I feel on myself. When Ive PMOd I always feel like I need to masturbate again within  minutes or less so Ill usually cum  times in a night and it results in a sluggishdepressednervous mood the next  days after which my testosterone I guess? begins to go up again and I feel okay as in no superpowers yet.The last time I had sex  days ago I came  times over the course of the nightmorning which is similar to a typical PMO session. It felt similar during the afternoon the day after. I was tired foggy and a little restless but then I was surprised by how quickly I regained my superpowers. Within  days Id say it was as if I never orgasmed.I guess my own two cents on the subject is No it is not nearly as bad to cum during sex as it is to PMO in fact you should have plenty of sex if possible its a better workout than masturbation as well. But I would say that its something worth thinking about. If you have a steady sexual partner dont overdo it by cumming multiple times every day of the week  I think that could fuck with your brain as well. And if you know youre gonna need a confident boost on a certain day maybe abstain from sex for  days beforehand just to be all boosted up.,NoFap,cwdxoj0,2,t5_2skrn

This is so huge for me because it feels morally right on so many levels. I dont want to be the person who lets life passby instead be someone who will find himself standing in front of his dreams one day.

For addicts however such as many fapstronauts are that can be the worst enabling phrase ever. Im sure every addict ever thought I just need to scale it back Ill be fine. Nuuh.My point is OP youre right. Masturbation isnt good or bad. Its not healthy or harmful. It is what it is under very personal circumstances and thus NoFap should not be recommended to anyone and everyone. People with porn addictions sure why not suggest it to them? It can only help.

5513511,0,t3_3mvn4k,Hi Guys! Im a noob to Reddit and joined just because of this thread because I have to see if you guys can help me as Im kind of desperate at this stage.Im a  year old malenearly  and for the past few years Ive had a horrible masturbation addiction. At first it started out pretty basic with all the normal porn first like POV threesome stuff etc. but over time I noticed my sexual attractions become more and more warped the more I watched porn. I started watching rape related videos on porn sites then onto shemale stuff even a few piss fetish videos. I didnt understand why I was watching this stuff but as soon as the thought of masturbation gets into my head its like the conscious part of my brain just switches off and the sub conscious part takes over. Im like a completely different person when I start searching the internet for things I can masturbate to.I knew what I was watching was fucked but that was the shameful thing about it. The fact that I found it wrong really turned me on in a sick twisted way. The more I became used to porn like this the more my fantasy and urge had to be fulfilled more. Normal was boring now that I discovered more extreme stuff. Right now every now and then Ill go onto one of those cesspit chan sites and wank to young girls in skimpy outfits in suggestive poses. I know what Im doing is wrong and messed up and it turns my stomach when I think deeply about it but I just cant seem to stop masturbating to taboo things. I fear if I keep this up Ill end up as a fully fledged pedo and honestly the thought of that scares the living shit out of me.Because of masturbating so much Im still at virgin at the age of  and I dont even feel attracted to real women as my brain has been rewired into thinking that other things are sexually attractive. As you can probably imagine this has really fucked with my quality of life significantly. I am as shy as ever with little to no confidence and nervous for no reason around people cant talk to women and if I do I havent a clue what to say or how to go about approaching them. I became much more anxious when dealing with people in real life. I suffer with anxiety and I am a hypochondriac that tends to worry and overthink things to an insane degree so I know thats not helping me at all either. I seriously need your opinions and thoughts of what Im going through. I know that my brain has been rewired by porn and I know it can easily happen to anyone. The brain is a complex thing and it can be manipulated and molded by many contributing factors. Ive tried stop masturbating but I always end up giving into temptation and then boom back to square . I know ill just end up on masterchan or some shit again and Im sick of giving into these sick urges and letting them control me. I know Im capable of getting the old me back and vanquishing these sick invasive urges but I need to get some advice from people that can relate to me. Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post guys but Im sure you can understand the gravity of my situation.  ,NoFap,cwgegg5,1,t5_2skrn

5515952,0,t1_cwgbrjy,Sure but I think pornfree would be antiedging. Theyre just not antimasturbation in its totality.They say... if perhaps youre a teenager in love but not having sex that you can masturbate to the thought of your dearest darling after youve been kissing all through your date. Its not really edging its looking for relief for impending blue balls.I see that some on nofap would be against that too but I cant imagine many people edging without the additional stimulation of porn. Honestly sitting there for hours masturbating to your own lurid imagination with zero additional stimulation? Wow.Additionally the sidebar of nofap has easy mode which simply states no porn. You can still masturbate.,NoFap,cwgpoed,1,t5_2skrn

5521052,0,t1_cwh7vue,It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being but on the contrary their social being that determines their consciousness. Karl Marx not on porn of course yet the mass culture including that amount of sexual stimuli in advertisement movies and so on as a form of social consciousness can be viewed as a superstructure risen on the economic foundation.  Youre right to some extent but apart from artificial sexual stimuli there are also natural ones surprised? and the arousal sometimes come from the presence of a real girl in front of you not from pixels. Nevertheless the overexploitation of sex in the mass culture aimed along with a bunch of other tricks to make us neversatisfied consumers is the main cause of that obsession with sex in humanity as whole. But once again nofap implies no porn. What would you do with porn if you couldnt fap to it? So the focus of rnofap should remain nofap.,NoFap,cwhd4kn,2,t5_2skrn

Therefore making you more distant when it came to the idea of faith and religion. Theres nothing wrong with having faith or not having it just remember that either or is not responsible for your own achievements its because of your dedication and along the path to success in breaking away from PMO do you want to start including religion later into it or not is your own personal choice. I myself have constantly been in cycles where during relapses I try looking to religion for help maybe I would read the scriptures and become enlightened lol. Then often times i found initially I would be all religious etc and then as the week went on my streak increasing less and less did I turn to God. Maybe think of it as God does not want us to depend on him but he wants us to become independent so we can be strong ourselves. ,NoFap,cwnanuv,1,t5_2skrn

Its fine if you and your girlfriend want to abstain that is completely up to you and how you want to live your life  but the belief that a sexless relationship is better or purer than a sexual one is not good.Your mother looking out for your health isnt assuming the worst.

Also I noticed that my nails were growing much faster.When I searched about hair regrowth I saw some success stories. They all included abstaining from ejaculation. Semen is nutrient rich and when you are not wasting it body uses the nutrients to produce hair and nails instead. Besides nofap you must see to it that you eat quality fooddiverse food fruit vegetables lots of nuts etc.  and that you exercise regularly. Thats the best way to prevent hairloss but nobody can guarantee it because the genetics and stress factor play a major roll too.,NoFap,cwoyxk3,1,t5_2skrn

Still probably wont take you that long to read PIn all honesty though eye contact can mean very many things. Very subtle changes in the way you look at somebody can significantly change the meaning and how your gaze is interpreted.

And they are so easy and usually are made to make you feel good about yourself. If you compare challange of finishing game to learning an instrument there is no challange in game.I believe this made me impatiente I want to have fun so fast that when I am not immediatly entertained I feel bored. POM does same thing it is cheap and easy entertainment with huge reward.I am not saying that you cant play games it is a good relax for some people I assume.

The neurons need fuel substrate nutrition to actually repair themselves and sleep. In fact Id argue that most of the benefits people get through therapy come through time eating and sleeping because talking a person out of depression isnt nearly as helpful as the brain being able to produce and be sensitive to opiates that actually produce feelings within.

5751728,0,t3_3tx5hk,Ive failed a considerable number of times as well. I ruined a  day streak once talk about major remorse....  Ever since then it seems like I relapse every  weeks. I find it ridiculous that every time I fail I feel like ive gone back to the point where I started my NoFap Journey when in truth Ive still made an insane amount of progress since then which I try to thank myself for. Let me tell you what works for me... Ive tried adult filters too and that never works for me either its a mental battle and its difficult but its well worth the effort. I write daily even if its just a few words. I only just started writing on here to help myself. I keep a notebook filled with my thoughts and those thoughts help keep me accountable for how I act. Something else that has a MAJOR effect on my success in the past is having an accountability partner! It seems pretty simple but just having someone going with you day by day through the battle can make it much easier you can make a simple competition out of it. This resulted in one of my longest streaks of all time and it helped me get a couple friends on board with the NoFap idea all my friends who stuck with it are very thankful that I convinced them it would create positive change in their lives. Find an accountability partner on here if you need one.  DONT STAY UP LATE. I find waking up early and going to bed early to be the best practice against PMOing. Everytime I fap its after midnight so I simply avoided this by going to sleep at p. I was never a morning person. NEVER. But I changed this by reading The Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod. Changed my life much like NoFap. If you need any help me and thousands of others are here for you on this journey just remember that. Youre not alone. Thats why this community was created.

On more postit notes write down information such as the date and time of your last relapse certain Bible verses that will help you and as many fap deterrents as possible. Keep all of these postit notes right by your computer so you will be forced to see them every time you look down therefore when you are about to relapse you will see all of that and hopefully be deterred.Another important step is to remember John   For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world but that the world might be saved through Him.... You see God does not want us to sit around and purposely make mistake after mistake but He knows that we are imperfect beings and sent down His son to save us. Therefore there is always hope for everyone and do not forget it. Lastly try doing all of this for God. Let Him walk with you down this rough bumpy painful path. It will be very hard but the reward in the end will be worth it.This way of life can often be hard confusing and stressful. I am more than willing to help anybody.

No more confusion no more struggling whenever youre in a tough situation you should know exactly what to do to avoid relapse if you dont figure it out and improve the system that way.Of course you have to be really committed to follow such a system.

In theory abstinence from MO is completely neutral for your health but masturbation can lead to issues with edging death grip etc. if youre not careful. In my opinion its just better to stay away from MO altogether but only you can make that decision.Longterm abstinence from sex with a partner is a physically neutral act. Its true that sex with a partner does have physical and emotional benefits in fact its encouraged in NoFapPornFree. But though it might stress you out if youre not abstinent by choice longterm abstinence isnt bad for you in a physical sense. If youre depressed PMO or MO is not going to make you feel better.

5817562,0,t1_cwh9c6n,Hey manJust wanted to share an update with you. days since I discovered no fap.Not watched a single porn video for  days. orgasms  during sex  a wet dream. I know you consider the first a relapse and I am about  days away from reaching  days since that as well.Been meditating much more work out reading more focusing on myself more.So much self improvement realized that I am not a door mat and my opinion matters. I will not lie down and have the world tell me what to do. My problem I was scared and anxious all the time it still happens but a lot less.Also I realized that a part of my brain is fucked and it kicks me around into believing a situation is bad. I am still getting control over that and its a constant fight.But realizing that is  of the job done right?I will continue yes I pay a lot of attention to numbers sorry if it annoys you  I am now targeting completing the next  days.I know that even after that it is not that something will magically change I have to keep going and make constant effort.Just one question currently my wife is also busy so we are not very active sexually but what about later? I mean sometime I will have to have sex and since I am not fapping now I am sure I will burst at that time? Hope to complete the next  days before that.Every day is a fighta struggle to better myself a constant journey of self discovery ,NoFap,cxi81ck,1,t5_2skrn

5819171,0,t3_3uwhp2,Hey man rough time. Good for you for sticking with it so far.  days is a strong start and more than most guys manage the first time they try.. or ever. So you are doing well.Im going to make some guesses here... Id guess that the loneliness and depression isnt completely new. It was probably there before but you used to use porn to cover up your feelings? Is that right?If thats about correct then giving up on PMO has uncovered how you really have been feeling all along. NoFap alone is not going to change this... it looks like youre going to have to do something more. New activities that are going to help your selfimage and selfconfidence. This is going to be hard at first because you are feeling down and its hard to start new habits when you feel lowenergy. But I really recommend it start some new things. Many guys here start working out running or lifting weights. It really helps how you feel. But there are lots of other options. Learn to code learn a language or an instrument join some kind of activity group that gives you more social time... many options.Hang in there. You made a strong start!,NoFap,cxif85e,1,t5_2skrn

5842645,0,t3_3v7uo6,Good job escargo. Today is day  for me not sure if my count is accurate on reddit i havent checked but its definitely day . To be honest Ive read all about these fringe benefits or superpowers that you gain when you commit to NoFap but i just havent seen them manifest in my life. Im fine with my voice and how people perceive me. My confidence level is decent but same as it was before. Ive actually felt added stress during this time period. A lot of it hinges on the fact that Im dating again and if i wasnt focused on dating rather than PMO i dont believe id have made it this far but i feel good to go to  and beyond now. Life is very busy and my girlfriend lives an hour drive away so Im able to see her about twice a week or so. Whats added to the stress is my inability to maintain an erection. I even tried looking at some nude photos today just to see what would happen and my body barely elicits a response. Its very disconcerting. Mind you when Im with my girlfriend i can get an erection but its difficult to maintain. Im definitely not ready to sleep with her as I cannot face failure in the bedroom again. Its the whole reason i began NoFap i struggled for about  years with either or both porn induced erectile dysfunction and performance anxiety. Im hoping after a bit more time everything goes back to the way it should be. I only want to focus on my girlfriend at this point and i pray for the rewiring to happen. ,NoFap,cxlhwqo,1,t5_2skrn

Ive noticed changes in the regards that its easier for me to get turned on. Ive also noticed that ive started to pick up on things that were long lost to me like reading. I find more and more boring things interesting. Also my sociability with people has increased because Im not so in my head. But all this My broken leg has healed overnight! stuff is a bit far fetched. that alone is a HUGE change in my mental state where as before my porn taste were edging on disgusting I was watching everything from rape porn to bestiality to get me off. Now just the thought of seeing a girl in the nude is enough to excite me. for you the effects may be different. but  weeks isnt that long. yet youll have someone claim that  days of NoFap and the can suddenly walk again after being in a wheelchair their whole lives. take it for what its worth if you find yourself wanting to look at porn thats a form of addiction. for instance me Id be sitting there playing a game and then have to hit pause to look at porn. the reason your urge is increasing is because your body is looking for a release. and they only release youve been giving it be it once a day or whatever is pmo. its like smoking a cigarette when youre drinking but thinking its disgusting when youre sober. addiction has a large grey area. ,NoFap,cxz0q5k,2,t5_2skrn

5971991,0,t3_3x8p7d,The full answer is this. First some definitions. Edging is fapping to porn without orgasm. Pretty much just pm. Some people say hey! If I dont orgasm then I should be fine right? Wrong. When you watch porn your dopamine shoots up. Youre clicking. Youre watching the pleasure centers go crazy. Now you add fapping. Jackpot. You feel amazing your brain is oozing with dopamine. Its bathing in chemical soup. This is where it gets bad. Theres no release. What was once a half hour  hour session with a come down. Your brain is stuck at very high levels of dopamine. Essentially when you orgasm you release prolactin which helps bring you down. By just edging youre in a constant state of euphoria. This makes the come down a lot harder. When you stop your brain goes back to what it was before but now the baseline is way up there. You feel like shit you feel restless. ,NoFap,cy2gjam,8,t5_2skrn

Time is relative as well. You cant make things go faster. You can waste time but you cant just skip from day one to day ten without dealing with all the in betweens. I think about this quite a bit. I have a two year plan Im working part time where I used to work hrs  days a week and my perception of time has changed. Its a lot more peaceful. Also in regards to my plan. I worry a bout things happening a couple of years down the road when Im struggling staying sober for a week. Looking back at your question just remember the after feeling. Ive tried very hard to make promises with myself after relapse but they usually fail.

But the things that people do inplace of wasting  to  hours daily fapping could certainly help.  The science you are quoting is at best poorly researched.  Check out Your Brain on Porn.  If people want to change a habit.  If they want to be exited about the possibility of changing there lives by doing something.  Why do you want to save them from trying to stop wasting there time fapping.   Do you want to be fapping when you are  how bout  how bout  or  when does the thought of fapping just become gross.  I was stuck in PMO for years the affects build up and become more acute and addictive.  I wanted to stop I couldnt fapping was a distraction and medication from real issues I was not addressing in my life.  I wish I would have never fapped I wish I would have been more present and less fap happy.  But if its not for you this is a free world.  Ive seen a lot of improvements in my social connections interactions same gender and and opposite between myself and my spouse and family.  I know longer objectify people I meet and do not allow myself to think that way any more.  If you already do all this because your healthy more power to you.  Is it possible that in the entire world there are  people that need help changing a habit that theyd like to break but cant on their own.

I wasnt happy with the stashing a password in the house though. I need to make porn completely inaccessible if theres a password in my house thatll let me watch porn then my devious brain knows its  seconds tops away from getting its fix thats only  seconds longer than it would take if i hadnt bothered with K. It feels like a big step and its daunting but why dont youCreate a new email account somewhere like mail.com who dont insist on much securiity. Dont input your phone number or a second email address and answer the security question and DoB with random chactacters.Download K to that accountInstall K and set your securityUse random password generator to change both Ks and your new email accounts passwordsDelete all trace of those passwordsEt VoilaTry watching porn now without either a series of embarrasing emails to K your email accounts support team or factory reseting you PCBTW if someone knows a way around this please keep it to yourself just chuckle to yourself and be contented thinking that im an idiot im really really happier not knowing! ,NoFap,cym5kc9,1,t5_2skrn

6132125,0,t1_cym2eth,thank you for your comment.Indeed I have a welcome screen which reminds me porn is harmfull but only on PC. I guess I should have one on my smartphone. Its difficult but I try to stay strong.You know what borders me? The fact that porn ruined my life. The problem with porn is you have an easy access to sex and satisfaction so there is no need to improve yourself. During NoFap I expierenced I was not social and careless everytime I PMOd. I am  now and I am addicted since  . I thought it would be ok to PMO cause masturbation is considered normal in our society but I was wrong. I can remember my first time watching porn. At first I was terrified because of the screaming of a woman in porn but then I thought   Hey thats how childrens are made. Its ok. Just fucking jerk off.I was a fool and I regret that. You know why? Cause porn made me to an antisocial beast during my teenage years...I know for some porn is not a huge problem but for me it is..Thanks for your reading and sorry my long post.,NoFap,cymnpvi,1,t5_2skrn

6246194,0,t1_cyzgfnr,From what Ive heard on this sub the issue is that fantasizing can reinforce the same neural pathways that porn has built. So how about two scenarios here You fantasize about your gf reinforcing those pathways in the brain. Between that reinforcement and the fact that I doubt you fantasize about the feeling of love connection and intimacy but rather fantasize about the act itself your brain continues to think of sex as what you see in porn. Yes your habitual porn use is avoided but its been replaced by this. If your relationship ends youre left in a tough spot with those pathways still strong and a hole that needs to be filled. You can guess what happens. You dont fantasize because why would you need to? Sex is something that is on your mind when you see your girlfriend when shes there with you. Sexual thoughts dont control your life anymore and every experience you have with her is real and youre engaged in the moment. Meanwhile the pathways are still weakening. If your relationship ends you can keep going. You likely no longer fantasize at all as that habit has been broken and you arent prone to relapse as a result. You can walk down the street and see girls without thinking about how theyd look in a fantasy.This is still definitely an individual choice but I would choose the second. NoFap for me means more than getting over PMO it means getting over the damage done by porn too.,NoFap,cyzmhqm,6,t5_2skrn

Also almost nobody cares if you die. Not only if you die but we all. The only persons that do care are your family and close friends. Like you said except my dipshit family so youre just like anybody else and having a normal life.        Work on yourself to fix the last few problems you mention. There are many subreddits that can help you. Start with cold showers. If you talk about the world and especially your family like that of course no one wants to be your friend.        Also worrying about social media likes? Wait till you must go from trash bin to trash bin to search for some food. Son you have some fucked up priorities.    Man the fuck up and fuck you. You are living your own live so you can shape it the way you want. Got no friends? Go outside and make some but you probably got a ton of bullshit excuses for that.        ,NoFap,cz1imat,6,t5_2skrn

Instead evolution has given us reason discipline and politeness. Its what mskes us so superior to the other animals.

So i muted the video and looked away any time a scene would pop up. Like i say i dont think thats the best way so the next year i watched the scenes and even though part of me wanted to masturbate i strengthened my resolve by not doing it.

I doubt people can answer that.For some masturbation is a slippery slope. What started as a weekly thing leads to daily. Then multiple times a day then to porn and then things go on a downward spiral. This is a controversial topic. The most important thing is to know yourself. What is your weakness?

Besides its not just the brain that heals in  days the entire body the hormonal levels vigor vitality stamina and many dozens of other important manly body functions get impaired. They have come up with  days by rounding off from a fact  A fact that it takes . to  months for sperms to fully mature. So  months translates to about  days. So When the sperms are fully mature and yet you dont let them reach their target thats when you can demand what you want from them and they will bless you with whatever you want with little effort from you. Many people feel super powers and abilities and claim that they could do things that they never even imagined was possible. This is just the body using the otherwise energy amp matter used for sperm production to focus on the other needs of the individual. Masturbation had forced the brain to think that all there is in this world to achieve is just orgasm. We must strive to unlock our fullest potential by controlling our appetite for orgasm and letting the mind give us what we want in life other than orgasm.

Anxiety is fading but theres still a little left.Ive stopped counting the days because I dont care about it anymore. Im done with pmo and Im done needing motivation from rnofap.Especially since the info here is getting repetitive.Its like Im starting to see nofap and my previous porn habit as one whole junkball that I dont need in my life that shouldve never been apart of my life.

And if they still dont follow nofap then just mention it once in awhile in while without making a huge argument about it. Just say something like you should do nofap it makes you feel great! Then go on with your business. What this does is keep nofap in their brain so if something is wrong and they are looking for an answer they will think abiut nofap. At the end of the day its your kids life and they have to decide what they want to do all you can do is guide them to the best of your ability. Moderation is key and it will earn your kids respect.

Be productive all day and dont be in the house alone if you are alone go outside to the library gym whatever. Stay up and active all day. Make sure youre active enough that youre tired by the end of the day and go to bed early enough so that you get enough rest whatever amount of sleep you need. In addition to that cold showers  meditation  exercising  reading  eating well should keep your mind occupied and should give you places to redirect your urges. When you get an urge recognize it as an urge dont identify with it and do something positive instead. This is how you retrain your brain.

When you wanna touch them they say you are treating them like an object when you want sex and they arent in the mood they shoot you down and shame you. Before dating you they probably did whatever their one night stands wanted or the guys who were regularly banging them wanted. But with you she wants to feel like a special princess so she doesnt do all that shit. You have the problem where you have been shamed into thinking your sexuality is bad and that you need to suppress it. You dont.

Interestingly I had already started seeing another girl at the same time and the two of us were making out a lot. I was in the middle of my longest streak about  days hard mode and it was getting easier and easier to stop sexualizing them and just get to know them. The first girl wanted sex by date  and somehow I held off wanted to see how I felt about the other one first. Honestly with the help of no fap my dick for once didnt make the decision for me. Thankfully I dropped the first woman and went with my now wife. She is x better. And waiting for the sex was worth it because even though it took her a while to be ready she has been the best in all areas of a partner. Just keep at it OP you wont click with someone until someday on your next  dates or so you just find someone youre  comfortable with and vica versa. Its a lot of work but totally worth it.

6699034,0,t3_47dozg,The first  weeks were the hardest for me because they required breaking habits. Maybe its the same for you? Im approaching  months now and Ill tell you things got a lot easier after those  weeks. Things get a lot more passive and a lot less active once your lifestyle change settles. I had to be pretty on top of things and very mindful for those first  weeks though. One thing that really helped when I started was urinating often. A lot of the times I thought I was aroused I just had to use the restroom. Another trick is to stop everything for a minute and wait. I found that for me personally my head cleared after waiting for  minutes. I used to feel like my heated moments would last forever. They never did.It seems like other people on this subreddit dont masturbate or watch porn for some noble reason. Not so for me and honestly I think that if I had some noble reason Id probably fail. There would just be too much pressure and the probability of a disequilibrating event would be too high. Big beliefs require extensive networks of smaller beliefs that tie into how we see the world and how we see the world inevitably changes as we see things and grow as people. You can believe what you want but I think watching porn or masturbating has no bearing on being a man. I personally believe that stuff doesnt matter.But what I do believe and know is that theres no point to masturbating for me. I dont think Ive been particularly happy after masturbating or watching porn. Maybe Id get really into it in the heat of the moment but Ive never really been proud or anything after. I didnt learn anything from doing it its pretty much a waste of time. And thats pretty much what I was thinking when I was waiting for  minutes at a time in October. Whats the point?. Clearly I couldnt come up with one. Maybe you wont either. This doesnt have to be some large moral struggle you know. Maybe youre just tired of masturbating and watching porn and just dont feel like it anymore. Just because you habitually do it in the morning doesnt mean you arent tired of it.,NoFap,d0c8kvk,2,t5_2skrn

6720797,0,t3_47o2vu,To fix your edging issue I think you need to install some strict rules. I very recently made this change. I thought hey I can have my cake and eat it too! Im not watching porn Im not spilling my seed but I still get the great feeling!  of times would end up in a relapse. The last time I did it was conpletely accidental I wasnt even ready but I must of squeezed in a way and pushed the button. That was it. I cant even trust myself when to cum while edging so Ill cut it out all together. No touching your dick inappropriately. No viewing porn even if you plan on having a hands free experience. You need to be strict brother. As for counting days I agree. Everytime I notch all the days and see my progress that night Ill usually relapse. Its so fucked how it happens. I have a calender that allows me to tick the days. Once I relapse I skip the day I relapsed and tick the next day thats to start me off again. Once I get stronger into my NoFap journey then Ill go back and tick the rest lf the days. Im doing for life too but since Ive been PMOing for about  years Id like to see a numbered streak for my own personal pride.

6872120,0,t3_49vpga,Youre technically right but... Its the brain chemical reaction during orgasm that causes the biggest damage. It is the wiring of neural connections that causes issues with porn and the flood of dopamine during intentional orgasm is the critical point of rewiring. So yes its the porn that is most damaging but its the orgasm that catalyses and multiplies that damage. Someone once posted here saying Nocturnal emission continue the mission. Hands on cock reset the clock. I agree. I wouldnt punish for an involuntary wet dream particularly as scientists say its usually a hormonal response rather than a sexual arousal. And if youre expressing a healthy sex life I wouldnt forbid orgasm there either. So as you say porn is the core that needs dealing with. The difficulty is that for many of us who have already developed deep neural pathways that need to be trained OUT of our brains the forgoing of all orgasm does play a critical role as the orgasm is the drug were actually addicted to. Sure porn might be what has messed us up but the high of orgasm has now been deeply linked to the porn in our minds. To truly break the association requires the multipronged attack of dropping P and O which by definition for the majority of us naturally means also turning from M. Once the neural pathways have wired apart Dr Norman Doidge we can start rebuilding more healthy sexuality and sexual experience. ,NoFap,d0v9lwo,2,t5_2skrn

Youre telling the truth that way and later you can disclose everything if you wish. If shes a quality individual  which it sounds like she is  she will totally understand.Meanwhile if things get hot and heavy just be there for her. Fingers and some sucking  a darting and teasing tongue can go a long way.Lastly... do your best to not put any pressure on yourself. The more pressure you put on yourself the less likely youll be able to do what you want. Thats just human nature. Its easier said than done but its more important to put everything mentally behind you as it is with actually removing that stuff from your computer.

Delete the porn on your computer if you have copies on your computer or invest in a good porn blocker.  Install it.  Type in a really long random password in notepad.  Paste it twice and forget.

Almost like negotiating with a terrorist who legitimately wants you dead period. In saying that I believe the best way to KNOW for certain and stand on the top of the mountain that is beating addiction is to start the hard climb from the get go. I will admit and be honest with you though Im not on hard mode as Im in a committed and sexual relationship. However I am completely cutting PM. Also there is nothing wrong with trying methods but what youre saying is analogous to smokers trying to quit by starting nicotine patches or eciggs. Theyre still addicted to the root problem just havent fully decided in their minds I want to be done with reliance indefinitely. Im an ex smoker and ex weed smoker...

6935132,0,t3_4aon2z,So you think youve been hollow and fake? Let me tell you one thing. You are not alone. All people are fakes. The good the bad the ugly. Everyone. We all put on masks of what we want to be and try to make sure the mask becomes our next self. Some masks crack exposing the void behind them. Some people succeed but you will never see under the hood the price and the scars that was paid for to achieve that. That price is always paid in shards of ones own soul for this is how it works.Im a  year old virgin myself that spent the last  or  years fapping delusional about the porn into thinking it was normal thinking that I will stop whenever I will finally decent relationship. The moment never came up until the moment porn would no longer fill in that void with porn. I never drank alcohol or smoked weed thought I was damn healthy... So it took that long for me to get the truth... I ended up in my personal hell of severe anxiety depression added with the professional overburn. Ive been fighting these with no medication for about  years go and tell you have all of these  and your career is done. I was keeping effort to play my role of the cool social tech guy up until I could go no further. It was too much pain behind that smile. As youve ripped away porn from your life so did I. Cold turkey hardmode after  years. Im still kicking for already  days. And for one moment in my life I could face that very Void burning inside. I didnt rush to replace porn with something else for a while just stared into that abyss and I learned one thing Everyone has that Void inside. And everyone is addicted to something. Something that could fill it. Be it dancing traveling gambling or even books. Everyone compulsively tries to fill in the void. Take one of their favorite toys from them and they will suffer.Yes youre paying the price now just like I am. But remember one thing You got some of your soul back endured the loss of something that your brain treasured most. Dont waste it. You got those shiny pieces back in your wallet feeling that you can buy the whole world with them. But what will you buy? Choose wisely plan ahead and remember that just like you have got those shards back by ditching porn from your life you can get at least some of them back by ditching something else. Porn is no different. And dont be afraid to see that burning void again after you recycle another minor addiction. Be it coffee or that dancing youve been too hooked into.Any change is painful. Any change requires sacrifice. Any change requires you to take a journey through that Void. But the true challenge is not doing it once like weve hopefully done with porn. The challenge is in doing it repeatedly each time the world requires you to change. Remember that lesson well and youll be grateful for all those years youve wasted for theyve given you an ultimate chance to learn to bear that void inside you and through this knowledge you get the power that other people never had a chance to harness.Keep going keep fighting. For the fight is really only over when were dead and buried. ,NoFap,d12f9pv,8,t5_2skrn

They mostly fall into the exact same thing via codependency such as living with an addict...or even having children with an addict and emotionally incesting them.

Call a friend and ask him to do something this Saturday night. He doesnt have to be your hangout buddy. Just call anyone you feel like it or someone who you havent talked for long. I dont mean go out to hit on girls and do PUA stuff. Just go out to have a drink and talk and see people. It will affect your mood positively. In the morning go for a walk ride your bike or go for some food shopping. I dont say that netflix is bad but Id suggest devoting no more than an hour. Otherwise it is just a waste of time and can lead to depression and relapse.,NoFap,d1egb4h,2,t5_2skrn

7085244,0,t3_4chz8u,i totally agree with you on this. this is absolutely true. read my theory how this has a domino effectPerson   never had a girlfriend before in his lifePerson  had tons of girlfriendsPerson  will be very needy he didnt have the joy to have a gf and might even be a virgin. so his needs to have a girlfriend grows stronger each year. ofc he is a human being and wants affection a connection fun and loving sex etc... with a female. It comes to the point he is so needy and desperate he lowers his standards by alot hes so needy and desperate that it doesnt matter anymore so he even waste his time on girls he doesnt even like and agrees on everything what she says and just want to fuck her... he is the nice guy. girls sense this he gets none of it and get disrespected lowers his confidence even more. so what is his solution? he sits on the computer and faps to porn. he is a low value guy no girlfriendPerson  is obviously not needy very relaxed and confident a guy with standards. Doesnt feel the pressure to approach a woman why should he? he fucked another girl last week! He doesnt have to! lets say he loves football and a girl just told him football sucks. he will argument with her and defend what he loves because he doesnt have to agree with the girl or be nice to her because she has a pussy he might even call her a bitch. funny enough the girl will respect him for that. some guys will see this guy as the asshole but this is only a high value guy  more future girlfriends,NoFap,d1jh9c7,1,t5_2skrn

Society can be isolating if you work in a career job. Work is isolating. We may or may not be the least isolated stage of human history.  OP may think that computers is not true real human interaction. I know others who would agree.  Anyways your level may vary true that some people do want to be left a lone a bit more. But when your comfort threshold for loneliness is surpassed you can easily slip into distress and use of substances or porn.

7133922,0,t3_4d9qne,I used to have really bad anger issues when I was a kid. This is because I was taught to hold back my aggression really early in my childhood. This caused me to bottle up emotions and when I would finally let them out they would be through a furious rage. I once almost hit my friend in the back of the head with a metal base ball bat because he was cocky after beating me in nba k. It wasnt just our match that angered me but a collection of other things that I held in for a long time. The game just set it off. I wouldve killed my friend if my brother wasnt their to stop me.What really helped was letting my aggression out in the gym.Lifting heavy shit with lots of emphasis is a really great way of letting your aggression out and the environment allows you to do so. Thats why Im into powerlifting.Others move on to martial arts but I dont enjoy hurting people. So what you need is a way of letting out your aggression. I recommend something physical. Try working out. A good workout program for beginners that involves workouts that need you to be aggressive is Starting Strength. I would also recommend writing in a journal ever night or so.Believe me this helps. In fact my rage gets bad if I dont workout for a while. Just a week ago I almost punched my friend in the face for interrupting me. ,NoFap,d1p1qkf,3,t5_2skrn

WE NEED TO BREED OR OUR LINEAGE WILL DIE!   And then you did something running that wore out your body.  At the end your body was signalling your brain We just spent a shitton of precious calories  I think I must have just out ran a lion or some shit.

7141368,0,t3_4dcuoh,The biggest thing is that there really is no special formula. Sure some things work better for each individual but those discoveries and changes in training usually happen after the habit is built over a long period of time and experimenting. If you can hit the gym at least  days a week and try to hit every muscle group at least a week. While eating whole real food lotsa protein. No matter what your going to grow. Theres no special formula or secret you just have to get in there. Also I know that the first few workouts suck because of how nerve racking it is not knowing the flow of a gym or how to maybe perform exercises carefully. So Id highly suggest going with a friend or something who lifts regularly a few times to show you proper form and maybe some workouts. Just from experience I had buddys who enjoyed helping guide me while I started and I enjoy giving tips or pointers to any friends who are also starting out on their own. So dont be afraid to ask.  ,NoFap,d1pwb4y,1,t5_2skrn

I had some urges the other day to relapse but managed to get through them. Ive been having increasing number of sexual dreams and thoughts which makes it harder but I hope to ignore them. A couple reasons why I want to do this is to. Focus purely on my studies. Create better self control of my habits. Become more passionate about other hobbies . End this distracting habit of mineI want to become a better version of myself and the only way to do it is to stop watching porn.

7319566,0,t3_4fl267,gtI just dont like how I feel after seeing it. Im not a prude and I enjoy a good toss myself every now and again.   I think this is the crux of it.  Personally Ive always felt that most people feel naturally bad after watching porn and this isnt the result of being prudish or from external sources i.e. society says its bad.  I think it is the sign of a healthy instinct and conscience.   So I think the way to approach this with your kid is to try to find out if he feels bad afterwards as well. I would imagine at  he has seen some internet porn that is very disturbing to him.  You want him to understand that he should listen to his own voice that those things are bad.  If you can get him to understand to avoid the more hardcore porn out there that would be great.  I can only imagine that most  year olds must be disgusted by some of this stuff the first time they see it.  Another approach is minimize the amount of time he is alone.  Being lonelybored can by itself lead to porn consumption.  If he wants to play sports after school or go to a friends house  thats probably better than sitting at home wanking to god knows what.     ,NoFap,d2a6nbi,2,t5_2skrn

7333038,0,t3_4fpfwe,Well there could be a couple of reasons for it honestly.. Depression. Maybe youre not feeling depressed but coming out of a  year relationship will definitely change the way that your mind is operating itself. Since youre a pretty healthy working out kind of person youre likely to be more up because of the adrenaline and dopamine that youre creating from eating well and exercising. So it might not be feeling very depressed even though your mind is working through a lot of stuff. Depression can definitely affect performance.. If youve quit masturbating typically theres a period of time which is different lengths for everyone that you just cant seem to get it up and experience a flatline. This is something that goes away with time but its also part of the process of quitting. Basically its like when youre hungry for food and you dont eat  eventually your body realizes its not getting food and will stop giving you hunger pangs for a period of time. Then after a longer period of time you will start feeling hungry again. Similar principle.,NoFap,d2bpsh4,1,t5_2skrn

7452020,0,t3_4hat4z,No youre just describing really shitty low quality HD Mainstream Vanilla Porn. There is loads and loads of amazing porn out there without having to watch the cookiecutter scenes of some guy jackhammering away and then jacking himself off at the end because he cant cum any other way.In my opinion those of us who have no problems finding this good quality porn are the ones in the deeper hole here because it takes us a significantly longer time to get fed up with porn in general and just give it up.gtPlease stop shaving the girls genitals. Im a father and all I can think of when I see that is I want to put a diaper on it.On a final note no one cares about your daddy issues. Its not the s and s Golden Era of Porn any longer. A lot of guys and girls are into shaved genitals now and you have to deal with it yourself.Edit If anything the only good part about this post is the trigger warning because it makes me want to go watch some porn just to spite OP.,NoFap,d2p8xen,15,t5_2skrn

But heres the problem once in a while is a very slippery term during a period of low motivation you tend to fall back to the habits that are easy and  fun so it doesnt take long before you get addicted.

7588657,0,t1_d34pdeg,Thanks. I do appreciate your post. However I do not see myself of being a virgin as something that is wrong in and of itself rather symptomatic of a larger issue. Failure to be confident and express interest to women. Failure to not feel anxiety during the approach. Failure to not be comfortable in my masculine identity.I had numerous times throughout college where if I had pushed a little harder and been more assertive I definitely could have slept with a girl. Take the natural state of man and woman. They both experience attraction to each other. That is natural. Marriage is a manmade institution. That is why all but a few remain virgins until marriage. Not only has the age of marriage increased well past first sexual interest...but it has also become less of an attractive proposition to many.

Also as with any concept its open to self interpretation... take the parts that make sense and further your own self improvement and ignore the rest.gtThe image of a true man in my head  the perfect ideal man would not get worked up over a little attention especially not from a girl WHILE she was with her partner because he gets his daily dose of confidence from working hard helping others and of course from his own romantic relationship. He isnt constantly seeking attention from others to affirm himself because he is already affirmed. He would also have no need to label himself as an alphagorilla and others as betagorillas.

When this happens the pain hurts her a lot and she also told me that when this attack happens to her and IF she closes her eyes she could die.I think she has some rare sort of epilepsy and the doctors cant help her.

7607240,0,t3_4jgjqd,Top comment recommends therapy I would piggyback on that by saying...have you ever tried a psychedelic? I know it sounds wishy washy but there are tons of people who benefit from a good solid onetime trip. It may or may not be for you but if all goes well you will see that maybe a relationship right now is not what you need until you are comfortable in your own skin. Psilocybin and LSD both have very therapeutic effects on the mind and may reveal to you whats most important in your life and that may not be being in a relationship. Which is often just a deeply conditioned desire put forth by society our peers and media etc.It really all comes down to attitude. I used to bring girls back to my parents place.

There were a few times where I uncharacteristically talked to girls and it built up my courage. Like on my way to my interview there was this stupid rally and people were blocking the road cars getting mad yelling at cars and I asked some random pretty chick if we can go through there. Stupid question but she responded well and laughed when I said OK im gonna go for it lol. Could have had a convo w her but was late for my interview. Just stuff like that. There were a lot of times that day where I pushed myself out of my comfort zone to not just talk to but have conversations with girls. And even guys. I probably talked to over  people that day. I dont know what im tryna say is you just wanna get the heck out of your house and go meet people. chase your dreams and go talk to people and make conversations even if its stupid but try to make it as relevant as possible. dont have a filter. thats what im learning i have to do as a shy person to overcome social anxiety. and reprogram my mind to real world and real women,NoFap,d36wwg2,1,t5_2skrn

Focus on becoming a better you! Make positive changes in your life little by little. I gave up nicotine recently.. Instead of watching porn  masturbating whenever you want sex WORK for the real thing! Talk to a girl hold yourself until you can make love to a woman.. If youre religious masturbation is a sin.

Because too much gaming pulls your time and energy away from other priorities.  But Gaming is not a problem.  I have a wife two kids a full on career and I game as my hobby.  It causes no problems for me because I do not game too much.  I do not stay up late to game.  I do not put off other priorities and commitments to game.  I game when I have time like anyone else does for their hobby.If gaming is a problem for you i.e. gaming too much staying up too late putting it as a high priority then you should tackle that problem in your life.  But gaming is not the problem how you are prioritizing it is the problem.,NoFap,d3akthn,1,t5_2skrn

You should also check the sidebar which provides information for new fapstronauts. Before you begin you should set your goals.How long are you planning to abstain? The standard period of time is  days for a rebooting. Which mode are you planning to follow? I strongly recommend you HardMode.An amazing complement for the abstination is to take cold showersI know it sounds crazy but I recommend you to read the benefits of cold showers complemented with NoFap.

7663293,0,t3_4k9s9k,No do not masturbate.  If you have not yet continue on that path. The issue at stake here is that once you learn to self satisfy and once your body realizes it can selfsatisfy you will be drawn to selfsatisfy whenever sexual urges arise.  And once you start down that path it is a lot harder to stop.You are where we all wish we could be starting with a clean slate.  Keep that slate clean it is a lot easier to do defense then to have to take back what you once had.Also no there is nothing unhealthy about not masturbating.  Your body does not need to masturbate.You are at a truly advantageous position in life.  Work your damnedest to stay there.Good Luck,NoFap,d3d9twt,4,t5_2skrn

Your brain is probably not heavily wired enough for severe porn addiction after only  months. I became addicted to porn at age . Im  now and its affected my life pretty badly. Theres been nights when I had important stuff to do the next day but I stayed up all night looking at porn instead. Its affected my relationships with friends and with girls and my overall motivation for life. Fapping makes you tired and lazy and decreases your testosterone.

7702780,0,t1_d3hojdo,On an instinctual level I think theres something to this. Like Im not sure if we really know how well the body does or doesnt absorb zinc. I just saw a paper that said its around  and if youre eating food high in phytic acid its probably lower. As for Zn in ejaculate theres about . ml of ejaculate per orgasm and a high estimate of Zn in ejaculate is  mgL LITER which is about  mg per ejaculate. Thats not  mg but it could be significant. Whatever nofap is doing I have no idea but over time if you ejaculate every day at least twice per day for a year lets say. Thats a mild porn or just MO addiction. Thats  mg gone after just one year. Thats a fuck ton of zinc. Yes you get some from food. Now lets say its on the lower end of  mgL per ejaculate thats only  the zinc lost but are there men that ejaculate only  mg per L BECAUSE they just dont have enough to offer up? Because theyre already deficient?If you discover PMO at  the average I see here and are  thats between  and  grams of Zn youve dispelled over those  years ASSUMING you PMO x daily. Lets say you Are only x daily thats  g which is the bodys entire store that theoretically needs to be replenished over time and does through food. I say in theory because what I dont know is how the Zinc cycle works in the rest of the body. Will it always prioritize Zinc output in the testes to maximize reproductive health at the expense of the rest of the bodys Zinc needs? Long story short is that Zinc is vital and should probably be supplemented so you dont get a deficiency. As for its direct effect on your nofap journey No idea. Only way to find out is to try. The odds of overdosing is low because absorption is low. Just dont pop a bottle in attempt to repair years of PMO. It wont work like that. Healing is a slow process that takes patience.,NoFap,d3hr6ji,0,t5_2skrn

I have had OCD and I PMOed a lot. I forgot it all and when I quit PMO last year for a while it returned and it is a lot stronger.I CAN beat this and I have to but I would like to tell you that repressing fear is not good at all and I hope that my little story can help you realize that repressing your emotions is going to hit back a lot harder.In case you want we can do this together as you asked for a team.

7728475,0,t3_4l6ae0,I know your situation just finished my nd year engineering exams at Uni. Ive been in shitty situations similar to yours in the past. What I do is from years of finding what works best for me for the past  years of school where Ive actually been trying. For any kind of working I use the Podmoro technique I get the most work per minute using this. work your ass of  mins  min break do this  times then take a half hour or hour break to eat and relax. During revision I can work all my waking hours using this. Google podmoro for a timer with an alarm.Honestly try to cut down on fapping but in  days probably dont adjust your habits too much dont wanna be a week without fapping and it being all you can think about. Get a healthy amount of sleep  hours bro probably the most important thing I can say. Even if you dont know half your course the night before an exam. Dont stay up atleast if youre rested you can somewhat blag it. You aint gonna remember the shit you know or the shit you crammed the night before if you dont sleep.Focus on this and nothing else everything else can wait til after exams. Reward yourself when you do well not with wanking with food or tv or something. For real I dunno what year you are in but this isnt as bad as you think. Just relax do your best from now and you can most likely fumble your way through and get what you need.Ps. next time dont fuck yourself like this. It takes practise learn from the pain youre experiencing from this.,NoFap,d3ko8lw,2,t5_2skrn

Let me be clear in this years porn never deeply satisfied me because there never been love or deep feelings.Now i look for things that are opposite of porn how could you feel deep love and trust someone and they love youback or read stories watch movies about true love constantly and then be motivated to see girls as only sex objects again as strong as before.Something is missing in our lives if not leaving addiction was not be that hardI want to satisfy deep need with right way then I wouldnt be have to relapse for  sec satisfictions and i want to find whats missing.,NoFap,d3m74ce,2,t5_2skrn

7973468,0,t3_4od40s,Alright Man Im bored and browsing reddit an easy way to fail if you are on rall and so this is a little late but Ill give you some advise on what helped me get to  days my first time. You are going to fail its part of life. I hate failure. Absolutely despise it. Why? Because I am not use to it. I never really had much failure while growing up. I might have struggled or not accomplished certain things but everything I truly cared about I accomplished. The first time I was truly hit with something I couldnt do and still cant do it was a painful experience. So I reacted how I believe most people react. I had a choice to make. Either escape the pain or numb it. Most humans will agree that enjoying pain remaining in an environment that causes pain is not natural. Even those who might find enjoyment in physical pain only really enjoy it when they are in control. Take away control and they are just as miserable as the rest of us. I digress though.So back to my choices I could numb the pain and accept my failure and go back to this habit. Over and Over Again. Continue numbing myself to the failure and the pain it caused thus shielding myself from said failure and the risk of pain that it brough or I could choose option two Escape it. I want to escape the grip that porn and masturbating have on me but the simple truth is you cant escape it immediately. That truth will cause pain due to porn being addictive and because I will mostly likely be met with failure at some point. It is human nature to want to numb pain if we cant immediately escape it. See where this takes us? Endless Circle shit right there. For you numbing that pain is going on a binge. All of this is very good and philosophical but that is utterly unhelpful when faced with that urge and the feeling of powerlessness that accompanies it. So what are some steps to help stop you from immediately going to watch porn again after you have relapsed or help you get up and walk away before you get too far in?First you have to learn to accept failure. Now that does not mean failure is acceptable. Confusing? Unhelpful? Let me try an example. If you get punched in the face maybe because you are a NYPD detective on mission to find your partners killer and its taken you to this joint in a bad part of the town run by the Gallo family you are not going to throw your hands up in the air and say Well you got me might as well go and die now. Please continue to go Clegane on my ass NO. You are a tough detective who was raised by a good but poor Irish Catholic family Dammit! Youre going to move on through that setback and lay down some hurt! Failure Accept that it happens never let it become acceptable. Those who cant accept failure after it has happened are unfortunately Shit out of Luck because that shit did just happen and there is jack they can do about it. So that is going to lead to....pain. And the natural reaction to pain is numb it make it go away Endless Circle much? So how do we lessen that pain without using our old habit to just numb it away? Ill tell you how perspective shift.Okay so you are going to accept failure when it happens. How do you make sure that you dont let it become acceptable though? An Irish Catholic Priest told me this once and it helps me immensely You must never allow yourself to feel shame for your sins. Never. You risk allowing yourself to lessen your self worth with these feelings of shame and once you do that you start to believe that sin is all you are worth Now substituting failure in for sin because not all of us believe in millennia old moral absolutes based on different cultural norms from a different region of the world we come to my first point.  The fact that you have watched pornmasturbated in the past and you cant quit right here and now cold turkey doesnt make you ANY less of a manwomengenderfluid special snowflakeNYPD Detectiveect. You are priceless much like the moments brought to me by Master Card....I hope youre old enough to get that joke. Your failures dont and will not ever diminish that. Let me repeat that Your failures do not and will not ever diminish the fact that you are an anomaly in a world of pattern a statistical miracle in the face of existence a being literally created out of star dust Applying this we can now say to ourselves That relapse was a set back that is all it was and it doesnt take away that I deserve to be the MWGF SSNYPD Dect. that I want to be. Alright on to my second tip. The separation is in the preparation. NYPD detectives dont just walk into shady bars run by a notorious crime family without atleast canvasing the place or telling their new partner who by the way shows some potential but we wont let him know that. So dont stay sitting infront of the computer if you are bored or starting to get that urge. Fuck man. Go get some water. Go for a walk. Go to the gym. Go to a coffee shop. And if all of that is too hard yes including the water and you seriously cant pull yourself off of the internet at the very least go and watch a  minute video on something...anything besides actors performing various acts which by the way are fake. Seriously if real sex was  a video of a fender bender then porn is something directed by Micheal Bay in effort to stimulate your instincts which will only create risk of desensitizing you to real intercourse carries a risk of influencing your views towards the other sex not proven but hypothesized and will cause you to fail at achieving a goal of yours. Shit I will even give you some videos to watch insteadIf you are interested in survivalnatureIf you lean left and find a British dude telling people what is fucked up with the world rather humourousI Hate Being Single...a Youtube SitComSciency ShitThe piano guys technically not very long but I love their shitCrash Course....this shit right here.  minute learning vidsHow to Adult. Things that after you learn make you go Damn...that might actually be usefulSo there you go. Some distractions to help as a fail safe. Lastly you need determination commitment and tenacity. If you are still reading you mostly likely have that. Im at  characters right now and you are still with me even with that random detour into a New York crime drama You found your old partner by the way. He never really went missing he faked his death because he had been working for the Carpiichi family for the last five years as an enforcer and was sloppy on his last hit and needed to disappear. How did you miss it? Well being constantly hung over or drunk because you were trying to numb the pain of your son dying in the War dulled your senses. Although youll never tell him your new partner  character btw actually reminds you of him and is part of the reason you were able to put the glass down for the past week. It is amazing when you are able to see the world through clear vision after emerging from a fog. Still with me? Okay so you have determination here is how you build it up. Approach it like trying to increase your max bench Build it up by exercising your will power everyday on small tasks. Here are some exercises you can do to start out.  For a week after you eat dinner you will drink a glass of water with lime juice in it. Healthy if you arent allergic to limes.  For  days straight you will go for a walk doesnt even have to be long just go outside and walk  yards if thats all you can do.  Make your bed for a week straight As soon as you wake up.  Call a different friend every day for a week straight. These are just small examples of what you can do to build your will power. Here is the thing quitting addictions are never easy but people have done it in the past and you can do it now. I like to keep things simple  believe it or not so again here are my  pillars boiled down. Believing in your self worth can help break that cycle for numbing the pain of failure.. Distractions  can be a good thing to break self fulfilling pathways that lead to porn.. Quitting takes Willpower. Willpower can be build up using exercises.  Build your willpower it makes quitting possible.So there you have it. Hope that this helped. Keep up the good fight. If it was easy I sure as hell wouldnt be here and neither would anyone else. ,NoFap,d4cakcd,2,t5_2skrn

7973626,0,t1_d4c9vnj,People have freewill and have no obligation to act or do what others say or expect never be attached to trying to change another person be content with whatever they chose. So indeed tell him straight how you think but do not word it in such ways as you need to why cant you just respect me and i will respect you etc etc all of which are attempting to tell the person what to do and override their own freewill. When you talk this way you will instantly feel disempowered why you feel weak because you know you have zero power over someone elses freewill. Once you learn this it works both ways so when he says Dont talk to me amp he told me to just sit and not talk to him you will know you have zero obligation to chose this you can indeed keep talking or not sit or whatever and and now having no concern what this person thinks of you or obligation to follow their instruction you will feel empowered and not weak.

8022277,0,t3_4p32it,I think its both. Men create awful women and women create awful men.Men mostly value women sexually. Women have learned this and exploit it. When we value women only for their looks women only hone in on their looks. They drop the other values that men desire such as a good conversationalist kind loyal sweet chaste etc... Why? Because they dont need it. They just need  thing to be hot and its this  track mind of men that lead a whole generation of women to be Selfie absorbed narcissists. And vice versa is true too. Men have become weaker dumber and shittier. Why? Because we dont need to we get sex from sluts and women who freely give out sex. Sex is so freely given out now men have become shitty caregivers and horrible fathers. Hell most men dont even want to get married anymore. At least not when women are swiping right on Tinder for guys who are just swole and hot. Less and less women screen for positive male characteristics and less and less males care about being a good guy for girls.Thats why every good guy finishes last with girls its because girls arent screening for good fathers anymore.

Just going for what you want  thats exactly what I did here I knew she was with somebody but told her I liked her. And to be honest that probably alone showed her I have some guts even if shes not interested or with him for the time being. But it at least helped me level a semitier up.

Far too often I focus on my expectations of the benefits I should be receiving but are not getting fast enough when the true gift is that Im no longer a slave to porn! That is the gift. Real life will not cease to carry on. Not jerking off to porn will not change the universe but it will help us to interpret the universe a little bit differently each and every day. I expected immediate macho confidence and a killer workout drive with no PMO.  Nonsense! These things dont just show up out of nowhere just because I aint beat my meat for a few week! Besides maybe the alpha male dweeb I got pictured in my head that I think I need to be in order for others to like me in order for me to be ok is not who I am at my core! I get to find out who I am at my core now for real bit by bit. In some ways I even feel weaker and less sure of myself than I was before. But I could be perceiving myself incorrectly. Maybe I have just chilled the fuck out to the point where I dont even recognize myself anymore! Maybe thats the dude I really want to be. The guy who is ok with himself. Ok with being broken. Ok with not being perfect. Ok with who I am as is no strings attached.With porn I was never ok with who I was. Ever.

It wastes your mental energy that you could be putting towards bettering yourself instead of constantly looking at others. Making new friends is a way of growing as a person. People are meant to come and go from your life as each person outgrows each another in different ways. The person who is meant to be in your life long enough will always be there for you to call on the phone and drink some coffee with. Thats how you should go about it. Get into calling and asking any of your friends if they want to hang out. Its honestly a million times better. It could even be a girl you are really close friends with.

After just a couple weeks of nofap I have abruptly experienced more attraction to and interest in women than I have ever felt in my whole life.DO IT. Stop fapping today.

One question that shows up for me though is this if its only been a few weeks is it possible that though its far superior to PMO youre simply substituting in sex with this woman for your other addiction?  Maybe youre totally fine.  Youd know better than anyone.  Im just thinking that for myself if I were to jump into sex right now itd totally shortcircuit my healing process by giving me a new more legitimate way to not deal with whatever crap is driving my current addiction.No critique bro.

And we only succeed at this together.A couple things to consider as you start out that may be useful to youStep  Get clear on what you dont want in your life anymore.  Then get clear on why.  Specifics are key.  Absolutely key.Step  Get clear on what you DO want in your life.  Then start brainstorming on how youll move in that direction.  Again specifics are key.  Ever gone skiing?  Especially off the trail through the trees?  What a coach once told me was to make sure and keep my eyes on where I wanted to go the space between the trees not on the trees themselves.  As soon as you focus on the obstacle in your path you lose focus on where youre going.  Youll notice this when you start driving too.  Youll end up steering in whichever direction your eyes are looking.  Its almost inevitable.  And in NoFap its just as true if your entire focus for this month is negative stopping something youll end up obsessed with that something.  I totally support that youre looking to quit PMO.  FANTASTIC.  Best move you could make right now.  But I hope that youll do it not through clenching and agonizing so much as through deciding to live an awesome life in more fulfilling areas.Totally down to stay in touch on this one man.

8198665,0,t3_4rkirq,Right around day  it just feels like nothing. Im on day  now. This is the longest Ive been and its basically that way. I still view porn though because I dont really care that much. I can look at porn now and the desire to masturbate usually isnt there even though I get erect. This is about the point that my brain starts to rationalize with me which is why I always lose here. That or I wake up in the middle of the night with weird swelling sensations that demand me to rub them out. But no my body can go fuck itself Literally I mean I dont know if there are positive or negative effects but to be honest it doesnt matter. Ejaculation and orgasm arent even the same thing and the sensation of orgasm is psychological release anyway. Im almost certain semen retention has positive effects on androgen receptors and testosterone now after having tried it. I also eat very healthy. My eyes are brighter my skin is clearer and I can focus on school work and my constructive hobbies. There is no point to sitting there with your dick in your hand past your mids at least. Why jerk off when you can read a book? At the end of the year would I prefer to count up the number of orgasms Ive had or the number of books Ive read. And that sort of thirst for something else creativelyemotionally must start to spill into other areas of life. Sex is like the essence of what humans and animals are. I think its more important to harness and hold onto it. ,NoFap,d52dxei,0,t5_2skrn

A question Ive been asking myself recently is whether I watch porn because its fun and Im having urges or whether Im trying to selfmedicate because of negative emotions. One thing Ive found that has helped is to reflect on what I truly value which is something that has been hard for me to figure out but I have recently been able to understand just lately.

Whatever you do and whoever you are theres always going to be people who will think youre pathetic and berate you for it what matters is that you know who you are.As for your dilemma if you give in and pay a prostitute it might numb the pain for a little while but I think youll ultimately find it about as unfulfilling as porn. I was just reading a couple of comments on this sub from another user usqualldawa hope you dont mind me quoting you! that illustrate what Im talking about.gtI was a y old virgin living at home with my mom no driving license shit job. I bought a backpack and a one way ticket to bangkok and went travelling solo for  months.  years later I slept with about  girls got ripped grew so much spiritualy have solid habits in my life to support me. The damage is not fixed but compared to how I was at  suicidal and loathing myself its night and day. Its never too late my friend. The first step to change is information and knowledge. Then you have to take action at some pointgtThe damage is far from being fixed. I realized after  years of sleeping around that it didnt fix my issues for the least. I struggle with intimacy connection and social anxiety. I feel so isolated and lonely because a part of me is broken and needs to be fixed. Were talking childhood traumas here broken relationships with parents their divorce deep subconscious shame etc... Getting laid didnt change a thing its just a cheap high that kept me distracted for a while but now that I found my pain I cant ignore it anymore. I got good at getting women in my bed but I didnt connect with any of them. What I want now is a meaningful connection and Love with a capital L. For that I need to fix the relationship with myself live with integrity cut out all addictions and find safe people support group or therapy to talk about my childhood and learn to let go of my toxic shame.TLDR What you is genuine intimacy and love not sex.

8476114,0,t3_4vray9,Just gonna say a particularly brutal trip I experienced a few months back  I took some hawaaian baby woodrose gave me the kick in the right direction and led me to start my nofap journey besides taking control of my life in some other ways. It was really the kick in the nuts I needed at that time and showed me all that was going wrong in my life. Now a couple of months later I lost about kg I will start an amazing job next month and cut out weed and alcohol almost completely. I also still am on my nofap journey although I have to say that it still is a struggle every day and I still struggle with my cigarette addiction. But I am in a so much better place than a couple of months ago and this trip was the beginning. Not to say I wouldnt have got there without the psychedelics or that they are the cure for every problem you have right now but for me they were an eye opener and when done responsibly and with care they can absolutely show you the right direction. But please be careful as to when and where you are taking them I would advise to to take them at home with some relaxing music and some meditation during the come up and write down the question you want to have answered as well as the answer you get during the trip.

8478517,0,t3_4vta0a,Im the same way. Ive found that I literally have to kickstart my own motivation. I recently hit a wall with my own depression. So I set a schedule for myself every week now to force myself to get out of the house and realize certain goals.Everyday Ill get up early and take my dog on a walk for a few miles. Sunshine already knocks the cobwebs of depression out of my mind every morning. Plus my dog is looking at me all happy when she gets to chase after squirrels and rabbits. I come back home and get ready for work.Once I get to work I write down at least  things that I want to get done. I make sure these are  things that my boss hasnt even mentioned to me. This way if he notices that Im doing these things he knows Im taking initiative.When I get home from work is the tricky part. Normally a family member will have already walked the dog so I need to do something else. Ill eat dinner and either go to the gym  hours later or Ill go to a comedy open mic. Ive always loved stand up comedy so why not chase my dream? I try to go to the gym  days a week and do stand up for  daystry to squeeze in  sets in those  days. By the time I get home from either of those Im ready to go to sleep.Also most important for me is that I try to talk to  women I dont know everyday. Im terrible at talking to womenlow confidence. Im not trying to pick up every woman I see just learning to approach women with confidence. No matter what people say it is a skill and you should practice it.I truly feel that depressionthats not caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain is a newer thing because we as humans dont have the basic goal of hunting and feeding ourselves everyday. We need a sense of purpose and most people feel as if they dont have one. If I fill my day with these objectives and actually accomplish them what do I really have to be depressed about? Not much at all.tldr  Set small goals for yourself everyday. Maybe these small goals lead to a bigger goal. But we all need a sense of purpose and accomplishment.,NoFap,d61cvd4,5,t5_2skrn

8496782,0,t1_d63mofc,Usually when guys masturbate to porn they do so in the same way each time. Usually youre sitting at a desk or on your bed with your computer in front of you. Perhaps you find yourself with a hand in your lap casually touching yourself even when youre not looking at porn?    This is a learned behavior. Your body and mind have been conditioned to react like this in that setting. Maybe youre familiar with Pavlovs dog? Pavlov conditioned a dog to salivate every time he rang a bell because the dog came to associate the bell with eating a treat. Thats what a man does when he repeats the same action over and over and over.        So .... how do you stop that? You can do two things. The first is be especially aware of what you are doing when youre sitting at your computer. Every time you feel your hand in your groin remove it. Put a pillow there if necessary. Or if this just isnt doing it give up computer time for a while. If you need to check email or something do that one task and then step away from the computer. Essentially break the habit of being at your computer for a long period of time.    Computers and idle boredom lead to more relapses than anything else.        Finally fill your life with positive things. I dont mean inspirational sayings I mean activities. If you look at PMO as a negative activity then simply cutting that out wont work. Add something meaningful to your life. Learn a new language read about history exercise more play the guitar etc.    Make it so that you dont have time to be bored.,NoFap,d63ndgs,1,t5_2skrn

Until then I was thinking like most people do get good grades get a job get a wife make a family etc.. Since I started NoFap in Nov.  but I struggle to get past a month Ive been enjoying writing and I have this very ambitious project Im working on. I thought that instead of giving up to urges and fapping I decided I would buy a notebook get outside and write everything I had in mind. It helped me think and the fact I had a clearer mind not clouded with obscene images helped me too. And now Ive made up my mind and I found something to dedicate my free time on the years to come. I want to publish my bigass project online free in several language with an encyclopedia for its lore and with hundreds of illustrations commissionned from artists Ill pay with the savings Ill make. It may not seem much compared to a guy who decides to be an astronaut help refugees or cure cancer but NoFap helped me to realize that I wanted something else from life and to leave a trace. Im sorry for that long post didnt know how to stretch this but it was all to tell you that once you get rid of porn you may have another look on life.

Its tough to feel powerless hopeless trapped but change is possible.  You need support.  You need structure.  You need people to help you and you need to believe in yourself.  You can change if that is what you want.  I want to change.  I fail consistently.  I feel trapped.  I feel locked down in my mind.  I have lost my desire to be here and my ability to imagine a happy future.  But I have to try.    Death is just death.  There may be a hell but more likely its just nothing.  But assuming there is a hell what if its just more of this???  That thought scares me.  Why do you want to kill yourself?

8602178,0,t1_d6gr7gs,Your welcome mate. When I said the brain upregulates its dopamine receptors  healing I meant that the upregulation of dopamine receptors is the primary way nofap heals your brain. Im sorry for the terrible phrasing Im a computer scientist and thus sometimes  signs make it into my writing. As for workouts you should do intense workouts Ill explain what that means in a later on but not intense cardio. Cardio workouts like jogging is great for you as long as you keep them relatively short in duration no more than  minutes in my opinion preferably around . For after around an hour of constant workout cortisol levels spike which is pretty bad for you. If you look at marathon runners youll see how this effects the body. Dont get me wrong cardio is great for your brain but always do it in moderation. The type of intense workout you want to be focusing on in High Intensity Interval Training or HIIT. Google HIIT for more detailed information but the general gist of it is that you workout really hard for a few seconds to a few minutes depending on what your doing then rest the same duration or a little longer and repeat. An example of this is with sprinting which is my favorite workout. You run a  second sprint where you are working at  percent capacity then rest until you can run another  percent capacity sprint and repeat this  times or so. HIIT workouts can take as little as   minutes to complete and yield better results than hour long workouts. This workout will leave you exhausted but youll get a endorphin rush like never before.this is just an example though HIIT can be applied to lifting weights swimming or calisthenics. Though HIIT might seem difficult for absolute beginners it is actually a perfect workout for beginners because the only goal is that you worked out to  percent capacity. See an athlete might be able to sprint faster and longer than you but if it is not as difficult for him to do so he is getting less out of the workout. Sorry for leaving no videos about HIIT see HIIT has recently become mainstream and thus it is very difficult to find videos on it that arent fad garbage. If you need more HIIT workouts just ask.As for meditation the bast way to go about it is also the most simple. Just sit in a quiet place and focus on your breath. If you are having trouble meditating I recommend downloading the app headspace it does a really good job teaching you how to meditate.As for refraining from video games. Video games are fine as long as you dont overdo it. Even if you play for  hours a day its manageable as long as it doesnt interfere with your sleep. Many gamers myself younger self included stay up all night playing and that is where the harm comes from. Good luck mate,NoFap,d6gv709,2,t5_2skrn

8608673,0,t3_4xo0k9,It all started with nofap. This was the place where I find my animal instinct. I play a lot of soccer and on the day where I dont masturbate. I can sense a lot of things during the match. I feel more confident. I look in my opponents eyes to intimidate them. Its crazy how these tiny details can accommodate your performance. Eventually I stopped going to nofap because I think I have already learn what I can from this place. The people here are great. I love reading stories from you guys. I want to encourage you guys to keep on thriving because I could not have done the things I did without this forum. Despite that being said I am here to share a story that have being bogging my heart. Please disregard my badge number.It was in late July that I first met her at work. I introduced myself in the way nofap had taught me.  I believe this is the best form that I can be. I used to be very social inept. I didnt think of it much at the time we first met. Luck behold she chased me. I immediately asked her out. We had a great first date. She even asked me to stay over nothing happen until several dates later. I GOT IT IN. HOLY SHIT LIKE THAT WAS THE BEST SEX OF MY LIFE. I finally slept with a girl who I find attractive and she wants me. Everything was great for two weeks. We text snap back and forth. We shared stories pictures goals and dreams. For a moment there my world stood still. I never imagine I could be happy like this again.  This is where I felt something was wrong because I know for a fact you should not do this to a girl you just met. But I was blinded wishful thinking. Im not a pessimistic. I just felt like I am cursed with eternal bad luck.I thought this cant be real. Like all good things in this universe must come to an end. It did. FUCK! The third week was the worst. She begins to become hard to read with her constant mood swings. hot and cold. She has emotional problems abusive exboyfriend and crazy suicidal mother.  At this point Im like what the fuck did I get myself into. Im not equip to deal with this. I like to be happy and all this girl ever does is being an emotional roller coaster. Despite that this girl got me to care for her. I think I was too attached with a kind heart. HERE I WAS A FUCKING WHITE KNIGHT HOPING I TO SAVE HER. I should have known better. The universe is cruel and indifferent. She said she wanted space how she is emotionally damaged. Im like What the fuck? I didnt know what to say. It took me three days to find the right words. I told her that I dont want a girl who doesnt want to be with me and losing such a girl is not a loss. If this is what you want great. Give me a a call when youve figure it out. Now as I look outside the sun was sinking low and the sky was blazing with scarlet golden hue. I cant help but to feel nostalgic. I cant help but to feel bitter sad and angry. I feel used. These raw emotions do get the best of me. Especially when I care for a person that hard. I cant help but listen to the red pill forum.  They do have some good points. I think the lesson here for me is to be a man and simply walk away. Thanks for reading. I needed to write this out. Stay strong guys.,NoFap,d6hohi4,1,t5_2skrn

8681744,0,t3_4yudpt,I am going to disagree with this guy because of  reasons. st because I dont know what  I am talking about I st went on nofap  days ago that was when I started have not relapsed since. And we all know  days aint shit. nd because I got  discipline. I cant do shit with discipline. This is based on that people define discipline the same way I do off course. But I am goal oriented like a motherfucker. Tell me to wake up at  aclock in the morning because my life will be awesome and no additional reason. I will wake up at  in the morning until I realize awesome is waking up at  aclock in the morning. However give me  things like i did with nofap and an extended fucking story to why it will be awesome based on that I get up at  in the morning I will get up at  for the first few days and after a while start getting up at  because that will maybe take me even further that those  reasons explained. This will however only work based on that I easily can remember all of the reasons. Shout out to Quantum memory Power and Dominic OBrien  I like all other superheroes out there know that there is no thing called the truth shout out to Huna So what I did is just pick  things and made them true to me and if I went past these  weeks I started of by setting a goal of  weeks because someone said that after  weeks you are in like a new season and then planed on setting new goals. Anyway back to this post. If you are like me and think well fuck my life then I am just one of those guys who wont stop masturbating until my little pinkel winkel falls off then realize that there are a million different people out there. The guy who posted this is a fucking superhero he stands up for what is true to him. Shout out to OP! But also be aware that there is always a way. If you aint got discipline military definition try something else. Like my way. Which I under no acceptable way can take credit for I have been inspired by dudes like Brian Tracy the dude who wrote How to win friends and influence people dude even though he had a negative influence on my game for a while. But if you Neil Strause is reading this you did not. Cant for the love of my life pick up women the way you do but I memorized sections your how to book   and life seriously improved this was actually just a few weeks ago. Anyway you get the point there are a million fucking fantastic people out there and some of them will help you find your way. Just read a tone which you have time for now when you dont lose evnings and mornings to fapping. and it will cum to you. hahahah,NoFap,d6qucfm,1,t5_2skrn

8693175,0,t3_4z28g4,A senior monk and a junior monk were traveling together. At one point they came to a river with a strong current. As the monks were preparing to cross the river they saw a very young and beautiful woman also attempting to cross. The young woman asked if they could help her cross to the other side.The two monks glanced at one another because they had taken vows not to touch a woman.Then without a word the older monk picked up the woman carried her across the river placed her gently on the other side and carried on his journey. The younger monk couldnt believe what had just happened. After rejoining his companion he was speechless and an hour passed without a word between them. Two more hours passed then three finally the younger monk could contain himself any longer and blurted out As monks we are not permitted a woman how could you then carry that woman on your shoulders?. The older monk looked at him and replied Brother I set her down on the other side of the river why are you still carrying her?,NoFap,d6s9ylf,5,t5_2skrn

After your answer i have decided that from now on i will boycott news to see the benefits but as iam news freak and i like to be up to date about alot of stuff so i though i should only read editorials and analysis because editorials and analysis are mostly on the topics that are relevant and important.Do you agree with this or in your opinion its important to boycott them aswell?

8708019,0,t1_d6u44eo,Im not sure  why but someone on this sub linked a study that proved that women who watch porn have staggeringly high rates for divorce. The study did not say why and it was a statistical correlation. it could be that women who watch porn are already self centered people who care more about sexual pleasure than love and the porn didnt make them that way or it could be the porn changing them who knows.But its just like another study that proved that if women have many sex partners they are like ridiculously more likely to initiate a divorce. Once again its not known if women who have personalities that naturally seek lots of partners are just terrible at marriage or if fucking alot of men changes them somehow. But the studies are quite clear dont date a girl with a high partner count or who watches porn if you want the relationship to last.EDIT also studies linked porn watching to extremely high chance of cheating for both men and women. so yeah a woman watching porn is a huge red flag for cheating on you and probably breaking up with you later. since this is nofap we should all probably seek partners with the same values as us anyway.,NoFap,d6u4z4w,1,t5_2skrn

If I need to release and there is no girl in my life and I failed to pick up a nice girl before breaking point sluts do nothing for me then its either hooker or masturbation and I choose hooker.For a virgin a hooker will either make you or break you its a big gamble for your manhood. I say dont rush it with the first one you find nothing wrong with walking away they know how it works dont worry and instead find a hooker that you cant take your eyes off who is giving you genuine positive looks you will know when she is genuine shes hard to find but so so worth it a base connection you can quickly intensely nurture is better than no connection no connection sex is a living nightmare and will mess you up long term tenfold for a virgin experience.,NoFap,d6vvbi5,1,t5_2skrn

Id rather rub one out to porn then go out of my way to snag some girls. So fuck it. Lets do this!Are you not going to allow yourself to masturbate? View porn? Orgasm whatsoever? Not allowing any outlet for sexual release is called hard mode.As difficult as it will be I am game for the hardcore mode. I am trying to find some ways to prevent myself or make it harder for me not to view porn like applications on google chrome that block it.. but reddit oh reddit.. theres no hiding your front page. So.. time to unsubscribe.How long do you want this challenge to last? By default it is one month but  days is recommended for rebooting.I want to try for all of september. Afterwards I may go further.What are your goals?My goals are to understand myself a little more. Why are you doing this?To find out why I choose to Fap over Fuck.

8846817,0,t1_d7b8yi3,Sex is not true pure love it is more passion based and fades in time which can split a marriage apart. True love is unconditional true loves cares about others and puts their needs above our own I am sure you have heard the parable of the Good Samaritan this is true love. From my perspective the whole message of the gospel is to love one another.If a Christian has heard about a sin that you have done  are going to do and condemned you in their heart I am truly sorry about this. We all deal with temptation and it is particularly hard to not judge others Jesus does however tell us to not judge others. When Jesus died on the cross he asked his father to forgive those who murdered him. When one of Jesuss followers Stephen was stoned he prayed Lord do not hold this sin against them.  Acts .As you can see truly faithful followers of Jesus love others so much just as Jesus loves you so much regardless of what you do he loves you. He is just however and he cant just let sin slide because sin causes pain suffering and destruction this is why we need to repent and ask for help from Jesus to change.Please give Jesus and his people another chance the Church I go to is amazing because you cant help but be loved when you go there and there are many different people there who are still struggling with sins but they are loved regardless.Love can come in many different forms joy intimacy personal sacrifice charity supporting others hospitality the list goes on.I am praying for you man because I want you to experience this kind of love in your life too.

If youre masturbating chances are youre aroused and if you dont orgasm to completion it means that you will actually be aroused for longer periods during which your mind will probably be less likely to concentrate on other things by being singularly focused on achieving satisfaction from the reward of the orgasm. Imagine yourself having to deal with that thought by edging constantly. Probably not a healthy form of behavior. ,NoFap,d7ggksz,2,t5_2skrn

In fact and Im sure Ill get flamed for this but objectifying women will certainly get you laid more often. Wont get you fufilling relationships but it will get you casual sex. And in all honesty if men could get more casual sex you wouldnt see as much porn consumption. Most porn does focus on a womans orgasm or what appears to be one. I think there are a lot of issues with porn but people taking what they see literally isnt one of them. At least not for most people. ,NoFap,d7ia0r8,4,t5_2skrn

But the excitement and love for life that it gave me lingered for months. The last time I did it was with my bro in a nature setting somewhere in Austin.

I dont defend the testing as I said before Neither of us say we wont get hard or wont get aroused when watching pornI dont like the notion of not being in control over oneself to which you are constantly hinting. In its core relapse only happens because you allow yourself to do so. One moment where you think fuck it just this one more time one slip and youre done for the steak. When I say I dont like porn like I used to its because I know it wont make me happy in the long run I am not lying to myself.What youre saying is analogous to the thought that a food addict will never lose its appetite to his favourite food.Were just at different parts of our lives at different stages of progress I guess.,NoFap,d7jxmx9,1,t5_2skrn

8932078,0,t3_52mee9,So one thing thats happening is that your brain is getting used to having less stimulus and less of the chemicals that porn produces in the brain.Depression sadness loneliness and despair are gonna part of the natural outcomes there. Im with you Im feeling the same way today. It will pass.However you should be considering why you use porn in the first place. If youre like me its because feelings like loneliness are pretty freaking unbearable. Theres a reason why one of the highest punishments we have is removing people from the company of others. Because it sucks. In fact theres evidence that indicates that loneliness is actually lethal. So it makes sense that we dont like to feel it. And porn is a really great way of not feeling difficult emotions.There are some pretty major problems with numbing though. It turns out that we cant numb just one feeling. We numb everything. So by doing your best to protect yourself from some pretty crappy feelings you also protect yourself from good ones too.What to do?Try therapy. There are many therapists out there these days who can help. Look for people who specialize in PTSD. It turns out that porn addiction can be treated with the same techniques as PTSD. Plus theyre trained to get at the root of problems. Dont get caught up in the myth that PTSD is only for people have had severe trauma.Try mindfulness techniques. For example meditation. If you follow a specific faith practice check with your church or whatever. In some faiths it might be called contemplative prayer or something like that. Getting in touch with your mind and understanding how it works is extremely helpful. If youre agnostic consider looking at Buddhism theyve had a solid understanding of the human mind for centuries.Get out with your friends and family. And get out in the sun.Consider a  step group. SA SLAA SAA etc. are all good places to help especially when youre first getting started. Im on the fence about the  steps and sex addiction but I can say that going to meetings was essential when I first started dealing with it.Read this subreddit. Its fantastic. And if you can take a moment to add a comment to someone elses post. Youll feel better.There are going to be times when it just sucks. Hang in there. Anything has got to better than sitting alone and PMOing. Youre on the right track.Sack,NoFap,d7li5ea,1,t5_2skrn

8961115,0,t1_d7nxlnw,I think I used to be like you. My first nofap attempts were in early . In late  I once had a  day streak but other than that I never got further than about  weeks most of the time it was only three or four days. Now Im on my longest streak ever  today is day   and its also my easiest one so far. Im actually really confident that Ill succeed this time. The difference is the mindset. MAKE NO EXCUSES AND FUCKING DO IT. Oh believe me I am addicted. There have been times where I fapped then resolved to start nofap and within minutes my hands were basically moving against my will to browse porn again. There have been days where this has happened multiple times in a row. What helped me was a clear resolution months in advance  I knew I would do  days this summer. I mentally prepared for months. Now its paying off. In the beginning I was really anxiously looking forward to the day I would relapse  November  . I had it all planned out. I was going to buy myself an ounce of weed maybe even a bong for maximum enjoyment and lock myself up in my room for an entire weekend with a lifetime supply of tissues. Whenever an urge arose I would just tell myself that on November  I would get what I wanted. But as the weeks passed I stopped giving a fuck because I like the new me so much more than the old one. Im even considering going beyond  days and staying on nofap for the entirety of November just because it is so nice and in late November there will be some events in my life where it will be good to shine and be the best possible version of myself. It no longer seems like a good or nonridiculous idea to throw this away in order to fap over women being subjected to terrible inhumane treatment. I love nofap and you will too.,NoFap,d7ozp5p,1,t5_2skrn

Speaking of which...your next battle will be moving on from the longterm relationship that broke apart and sank as suddenly as RMS Titanic after being a large significant aspect of life.  Ive been posting on this forum periodically for a little over a year now and I make a habit of not telling anyone what he should do.  Each man must find his own path on this journey to the light.

She has deep problems that you cant fix my friend.  They arent your problems to fix anyway.   And if you dont cut the ties as soon as possible there is a real possibility they could suck you down into dark waters that will be very very difficult to escape.

How could a porn addiction be worse if it doesnt physically destroy you the way an opiate addiction can...etc. But I think there is a case to be made that this is precisely what makes a serious mental addiction comparable or even worse. If it doesnt physically destroy you then you can basically live within its clutches indefinitely. Your mind becoming warped and rewired over time and you barely even know its happened other than a feeling of detachment or whatever. as badworse isnt a particularly helpful way to think of these things overall though I dont think.

Porn and masturbation is strongly connected with each other. One cant life without the other. So if we were to fap again. At some point we would go back to watching porn. Once an addict always an addict. Just like an alcoholist. Heshe could stop for years. At some point this individual could go back after taking multiple drinks. In our case multiple fap sessions.

If you cant sleep at night take a cold shower it will kill urges and make you fall asleep. Next time you come home from your gf you go straight for a cold shower.  There is nothing in porn that will help you in your relationship in sex emotionally mentally or whatever. It will hurt you especially in the long run. It will hurt you and finally the way you relate to others.  If you like reading there are some good books out there that can help you on your way.

Then I started nofap and things have been on a steady climb since then not only socially but in other aspects as well. Now that Im in college and havent looked at porn or fapped once since moving in its unreal. I dont get nervous making eye contact with people or talking directly to them. I made out with a girl for the first time in my life on that first weekend of being here and it didnt feel awkward or forced it was just natural. The other day I was taking with a girl from one of my classes after it got let out and before we parted ways I asked for her number got it and have done some texting since then. Im more of a leader in anything group related which I noticed a bit in my last two years of high school but that was really only with the robotics team.

I always wanted to stop but knew I couldnt. It wasnt until I got older and learned that my desire and urges were natural. However today I am no longer religiousnot saying thats a good or bad thing and have now realized that porn is very deadly. The internet tries to tell us that its really not that bad but really it can cause a whole lot of problems. Im pretty much in a similar boat as you. I stopped watching porn for my own health rather than feeling guilty. ,NoFap,d8eausx,1,t5_2skrn

Once I realised I was not getting the love and affection I wanted in real life I looked at the pornography and only then did I see how deluded my visions of sex were.What made you want to stop masturbating? A pretty girl in a black dress.  Looking at me constantly and wanting me to talk to her My friend noticed and told me to talk to her I said no and once I got home I opened my laptop and only then did I realise I had a problem.What if any do you think are the negative consequences of internet porn? Social Awkwardness Every answer is sexually related You cannot have generic conversations.

9174292,0,t3_55ygkb,I try to do at least three days a week with one day of rest in between each day. I mix it up by switching with push ups and sit ups with dumbbell workouts. On days that I do push ups and sit ups I always do them in this pattern .... This means for example do two push ups. Rest for  seconds. Get up and do  more. Rest for  seconds. Keep on adding two to the previous set until you cant finish a set and drop down with exhaustion.The reason why I follow this format is because they say this is the most effective way to increase muscle mass and development. Once Im done with push ups I do triceps push ups and wide angle push ups following the same format for all of them.Once I get to abdominal and leg exercises again following the same format I do sit ups bicycle kicks leg raises and may add more to it later as I find more exercises.When I get to days with dumbbell exercises I dont really know what to do because Im still practicing with what works and what doesnt.The most important part of any exercise however are the forms. If you dont have the correct forms youll either not get the results youre looking for or putting yourself through unnecessary stress that will make you more tired than you need to be.It is also very important to stretch as this will allow you to do just a little more sets than you normally could and also prevents you from pulling a muscle or otherwise hurting yourself. First start working out just a little bit until you feel your muscles getting warm. When you feel that stop and start stretching as this is the best time to do it. Periodically stretch throughout the whole workout routine as this will also help you with muscle tone and development.,NoFap,d8ewqkk,1,t5_2skrn

Why is nature set up in such way that sex feels so awesome and euphoric?  So we would not go extinct.  If sex was boring then the earth would be empty.I am not sure if you respect women but you might want to try to be less cocky and more appreciative to women.

You will know when you find someone who is right for you.What to talk about? Anything that comes to your mind and feels important in the moment.Often you may think why am I talking about this? But there will be a reason your mind brought it into the space and you wont know that reason until you vocalise the thought and talk to through...Good luck!,NoFap,d90w60x,1,t5_2skrn

Prolonged blank stares lot of hair wavering and some glances through the corner of the eye noticeable nervousness when dealinginteracting with me directly obvious difficulty in putting a phrase together. Im not used to any of this I am  and was always addicted to PMO since  and I never dated anyone nor have I ever been in a relationship. I always thought women would be attracted to a athletic body and nice hairstyleclothing while Im just a average guy even a bit overweight. Can someone help me make any sense of why is this happening? Ive barely changed anything else in my life recently other than NoFap. I also started doing some cardio  times a week and eating clean but that was since March only in the past few weeks this has been happening leading me to believe it is strictly related with NoFap other than that Im the same guy as Ive ever been.Another thing is when I notice these things happen I dont even get nervous or anxious myself like I feel I should to the fact that they act weird actually makes me feel grounded comfortable and calm as if all the anxiousness suddenly went away from me and jumped to them and now I think youre the one acting nervous why should I worry? Now I feel I have to be the one leading the interaction and Im not afraid anymore. Whats going on with me? Did NoFap actually fix my brain???,NoFap,d948jsb,2,t5_2skrn

How can you dismiss the lived experiences of so many just because there is no scientific evidence to back it up?Most of the people who commented here confirm that they have experienced what was mentioned in the article. Are we all lying? For what? To dismiss our experiences and call them BS is just naive. The absence of a scientific evidence doesnt disprove that a phenominon exists  science is not always based on absolutes and there are things science cannot measure despite their existence.For example can you scientifically measure how much you love someone? You just cant but we know that love exits. Before you judge us as a bunch of unscientific retards and dismiss our experiences look at your flawed logic and naivety first.

I am going to try not doing it tomorrow and if I fail then I am really busy on Saturday. Tomorrow I will just make up things to do so I dont get the urge to do it.

There really isnt anything better than having a great life and sharing it with a beautiful woman.  Thats what it means to improve your own life and work on yourself.  Its all the same thing.  Good romance is the ultimate gauge of and the end goal of living a good life.  Its hard to appreciate romance when you are desensitized due to a PMO habit which is the singular reason that quitting porn is worthwhile.Look if you dont agree give us your experience.

God offers hope in the midst of unrelenting and incredible pain and despair.  He is always there even when we dont see or feel him.  Run to him and run to his people who want to help you.

9638460,0,t3_5d0gd9,They got sick of trying everything they could say they have said already. Thinking about talking to you about it does not seem like a good idea to them because past attempts ended in failure. If you yourself try to help someone and they wont do what you suggest how long can you keep trying? With me I try once or twice and thats it. Only a parent of a child has the sort of unconditional love thing going on to keep trying after that.My guess would be its your fault for not listening properly to what they have to say your not following them not being a good student of the ideas they are offering. By rejecting their ideas your making them feel rejected. Your probably a rebel kind of guy and do what you want and shoot down normalized peoples ideas of the importance of work then they go to work and find these conversations with you are creating dissonance in their lives putting them in bad moods.Its carrot and stick behaviour and your responses to their help are in the form of a stick so they stop. Your training them to stop If you responded like a carrot and smiled and thanked them and genuinely appreciated it at the time and made progress towards getting a job then they would keep helping you. Helping you would make them feel good and they would have no instinct to stop.and hey please get a job any job that has women around. Let your boss control you be a good follower. Im reading a book entitled The Art of Followership it explains how being a good follower actually puts you on equal footing with those you follow in terms of power dynamics. After two years unemployed you will have to start at the bottom thats what dropouts have to do.

9734868,0,t3_5ek1cy,Cant speak much from longterm experience since Ive never had longterm success. But in the short term I notice a big improvement Much more successful in getting done what I set out to do each day. Partly thats from having more time on my hands but also because Im more able to stay focused. Easier to carry over one day to the next. Nofap makes me more likely to finish the day productively writing in a diary thinking about things to do tomorrow and more likely to wake up focused and motivated to have a productive day.  More likely to keep appointments leave on time keep to a schedule.I distinguish these shortterm phenomena from what I consider to be a longerterm brain fog slower thinking bad memory especially for the times I was most heavily PMOing less creativity. Those will take longer to identify but I do think they will improve as I keep to the program.,NoFap,dad19f5,1,t5_2skrn

Keep fighting man of course theres some things you wanna quit because it makes your life...  only you know it  Keep saying to yourself that you wanna quit this shit you wanna live your life you dont want anything bad to happen to you example my hair starts to fall if i PMO too often so i simply quit it i want to have hair. You wanna live your life you wanna be happy you dont want anxiety and other bad negative feelings no your the shit man you can do this.

I also realised that when there had been times where I hadnt masturbated for awhile like on holiday I was much more confident and generally happier.But like you I feel no shame after orgasm and actually usually feel quite content and relaxed but having read the positive benefits people report I thought I might as well give it a shot.

The closest thing to desert I consume is a chocolate protein shake. The problem people here have with masturbating is that the instant gratification takes away from the smaller things in life. Similar to how eating cake  times a day makes bananas taste crappy porn makes a lot of things in life less awesome. When I stopped eating dessert it was easier to quit altogether than to limit to one coke per week or something.  Same with nofap. ,NoFap,dah291f,1,t5_2skrn

9844871,0,t3_5gangn,Hey this was a good read and something Ive been struggling with myself. I think I can take it even further and say that I struggle with the fantasy part even more so. When I started nofap and found my sexual energy rise I was happy it made me want too talk to more women. I did that and I started using the dating apps that I previously neglected. Which I think was good. The problem was I started using my conversations with these women as a sort of fantasy indulgence rather than actually trying to get to know them. There was some sexting etc and it basically just turned into a way for me to replace porn with online dating apps. I have to realize that its about making real connections and letting my sexual energy come from that in real situations and not take advantage of online dating apps to fulfill the porn void.

9884781,0,t3_5gy6f4,The issue of non porn comes up now and then. What about sexy phone calls? Sexy text messages? Its not porn per se.The answer is this. Your goal is to give your brain a two week rest so it can reboot from the release of dopamine which is from all sexual stimulation. Sexual books calls texts and other non porn but stimulating activities.There is something about hard core porn that releases Massive doses of dopamine. So no its not the same. However the goal is to steer clear of those things altogether. No edging in different forms besides porn. That includes nsfw pics sexting sexy phone calls and the like.,NoFap,daw0e4w,1,t5_2skrn

9888695,0,t1_dawhwa6,I think it was between  and  GB but you know whats funny? I almost never watched the movies that I carefully picked in that collection because by using porn regularly you need more and more extreme stuff just to get the same buzz. So I would go on HD porn sites and find new more exciting stuff. I guess in my stash there were mostly girls that I admired for their beauty and naturalness so I would have a great quality fun time.But again it rarely happened. Maybe when the internet connection wouldnt work I would go there.You know heres what you could do. It doesnt help thinking too much and obsessing over NoFap. It causes stress concern and believe it or not it increases the chances of a relapse. My advice is this Find alternatives. Do something that makes you happy something productive keep yourself busy. Just do NoFap and forget about it for most of the time. It will be easier this way.,NoFap,dawiq3i,1,t5_2skrn

9895583,0,t3_5h4o1r,I think your reflection on your situation is really setting you on the right path.But I do have one observation.  I dont know if it is really an objection or not since people may have different experiences. But for me the pleasure while I am looking at porn is very high.  Afterwards I am disgusted and filled with loathing that I am spending my time this way but while I am doing it I am liking it.  Sometimes I fear even getting up to go take a piss since I know I will come to my senses and I will turn the porn off and I will lose the pleasure.Of course it is not equal to the pleasure that comes from doing things that actually require effort and succeeding at them but those things require work and the pleasure that comes from porn is so easy to get.So for me and probably for some others there is a danger in denying the pleasure of porn.  What some of us need is greater awareness of how seductive and powerful that pleasure is and how it can prevent us from being who we really want to be.Fight the good fight.,NoFap,daxf2cf,2,t5_2skrn

Its much easier to start something if you tell yourself you only need to do it for  minutes or even  mins or something. Just small chunks.

Online conversation compared to face to face one is on a different realm. If you want social anxiety gone you dont practice in the digital world you practice in the real one.Small steps. If your goal is to do  push ups and you cant do any you first do a plank then  push up then  then  then  and so on. Social anxiety? Try walking in the park in a crowded place buy things in shops where you have to interact with others ask strangers on the street to tell you the time. That kind of thing. ,NoFap,db00rxn,1,t5_2skrn

9922361,0,t1_db0mntb,It depends. Its like asking how long till I can bench lb? when you first start lifting. Theres so many factors that its hard to say.I will tell you I went for a couple of months permitting myself to PMO on the weekends before quitting altogether. People dont talk about much on this subreddit but I think a decrease in frequency leading up to cold turkey is a good way to kick the habit. I quit cigarettes the same way. It allowed me to see what the habit was really doing to my body smoking just one cigarette a week will make you feel sick and dizzy which strengthened my resolve to quit for good.I will also say that NoFap becomes easier when you can no longer remember the fine details of your favorite old porn scenes. The images are still burned into my memory but they are dull and dusty. I dont dont randomly think of a big dick being forcfully rammed into a butthole woops Im thinking of it now lol but thats not to say there arent still triggers. The most potent ones come from a place of insecurity. Like when a girl doesnt text back and I feel like a beta dweeb I will want to haunch over view some vile digusting sex and beat my meat just to remind myself that Im still a man.

9930594,0,t1_db1eoi8,Ill try to answer that but im not sure if i managed to understand what you wanted to ask.I do think that using sticking your sex organs where they do not belong is harmful. Oral and anal as i said pose health risks. Oral sex could possibly get you throat and tongue cancer. Apart from risks for physical health im pretty sure it poses a threat to both mental and spiritual health. Mental as in the formation of fetishism. You dont make love by doing anal or oral it is just feeling good. Fetishism is also cumulative its gonna become boring at one point and new things will have to be added in. Spiritual degradation as in lust and pleasure seeking instead of love. Makes you a slave to the primal urges and stimulation. Handjobs i dont think they pose a threat unless the sexual act is just jerking each other off that would make no sense. By lightly do you mean like not much? Every now and then?If so i do not think such a thing exists. Its gonna feel good and you will want more. Unless you oppose it but yet somehow end up doing it and you have enough self control to stop it from happening again. Also depends on how many times you have done it id say doing it about  times is enough for the fetish to start growing roots in your brain.,NoFap,db1zck5,2,t5_2skrn

It was never that. It just seemed like it and then it became a habit training made it an addiction. But it was never what you wanted. Just an illusion. ,NoFap,db7s3mp,2,t5_2skrn

10020889,0,t3_5j6ai9,     Ive seen so many people here saying you need to replace the addiction with other things. And while that will definitely help you need to look inside and fix the problem from within.      We are human and get overwhelmed by our hormones so fapping feels like it should be natural. But we usually do it because we are avoiding something else in our lives. Its like alcoholics drinking to cover their problems.      So aside from the human factor of just being a man and being horny what do you not like about your life or yourself that makes you crave self gratification to compensate for your inadequacies? For me I would use it as alternative to productivity. Or to make myself feel better about not being further along with projects or just life in general.     Since Ive found nofap my life has changed so much. Mostly from the inside. How I feel about myself is so much different now.       So I challenge you to look deep within and see whats the root cause of your fapping.      Best of luck! Youve got this!!!,NoFap,dbdqzz9,1,t5_2skrn

However you can always change your opinion. My personal opinionIf you want to get into a relationship with her use it as a test. If she cheats dont girlfriend her. Who knows if she will just cheat on you with another guy? Not worth you time you deserve better. If you just want to fuck her just do it. She is the one cheating not you. Why should you care about her relationship? She is the one who decides to cheat on her SO not you.Something I felt like pointing outgt But on the other side I feel like I deserve something ...You already got what you deserved. A better life  all the positive side effects of NoFap. You dont deserve anything more than that. If you decide to go for the fuck. All the hard work up to the fuck is rewarding you with the fuck.

Your dopamine system is a seek and be rewarded type thing so if you didnt intentionally seek it then it doesnt do any damage. Same goes for something like noticing a posterad of a girl in a bikini at the mall as you walk by. As long as you dont fantasize interact with that thought or cause you to seek out more then you shouldnt worry about it. However this isnt an excuse to walk a certain route to work because you know youll happen to run into attractive female joggers. This isnt the case because you seek out that excitement.

Your brain is begging you for a fap but you dont. What do you do instead? Stuff you should be doing like cleaning your room homework talking to someone getting stuff done. At the beggining it is boring and hard you really want to fap but if you keep going all the positive stuff you are doing will become an habit. Soon this good habits will make you a better person.

10139332,0,t1_dbsvi29,here is one thing i tried that has worked although its not always feasiblelogistically possibleand that is to still try to stop PMO but realize that just the sex urge can be satisfied in other ways.one really helpful thing that i used to do and will still do on occasion when im single is just take that same PMO energy and put it into meeting women for sexgranted just meeting a slut to have sex with her isnt ideal after all a quality womanregular and ongoing sex partner is the best optionbut sometimes its a one step at a time thing.actually meeting a real woman to have sex with as opposed to just digital sex will start to reframe your sex urge into something thats focused on real women not just digital oneseven if youre out of practice or shy just finding any woman to be with allows you to satisfy your sex urge AND keeps you doing something thats not PMO.  In other words genuine human contact might be something to get used to in your life again.and hey... if youve just been PMOing a lot and your meetingwomen skills are not top notch you might have to settle for an ugly or a fatty but thats STILL BETTER than PMOand even with an ugly or a fatty youre still learningrefreshing the skills you need to meet be with women.so most certainly after one of two fatties youll be moving on up to good looking women ASAP.or better yet if you know an attractive but slutty woman call her up and take her out.  she might not be GF material but youll be getting back in the saddle and away from PMOOK thats all i got but if nothing else works you might want to give that a try!good luck!,NoFap,dbt5qwl,-1,t5_2skrn

I went another  days without any problems whatsoever but now ive been fucking my fleshlight once a day for atleast  weeks while listening to anime porn.If you dont have an incredible urge after  days i would say dont do it and dont watch porn ever.I dont feel superbad that i am back but if i could take it back i would.

Otherwise youll just stay stuck in a never ending circle. Do you want to be a  year old socially anxious guy one day who still jacks off to some pixels on a screen in a dark room? Of course not none of us want to end up like that. Heck theres people on this subreddit who are in that age group some even in their s.Imagine how they must feel knowing that theyve wasted years of their lives on this crap and failing to accomplish anything failing to build a life for themselves. Worst thing is they know that they cant get those years back. Ever.You have the choice to not be that person. You can decide for yourself here and now to become the person you want to be.Dont start tomorrow not in a week not in a month not next year.

10175338,0,t3_5loyra,Note this is a long read I just decided to say almost everything I know I would really enjoy feedback!I think the biggest thing that I focus on is doubt is poison and confidence is key Instead of saying you would like to do NoFap say you WILL do NoFap and then do it! Whatever you speak and think goes into your subconscious so be careful about doubting yourself and constantly bolster yourself! If you have a computer GET OFF IT UNPLUG IT AND GET IT OUT OF YOUR LIFE. Minimize all internet tech you have  like only use your phone  and stay off the internet UNLESS you are watching positive motivational videos or NoFap videos. Binge watching NoFap videos helps if your gonna binge anything do that. Binge the posts on the NoFap Reddit page too. Other than that STAY OFF SOCIAL MEDIA. Spend more time with familyfriends and just go outside more! Socialize more! Take cold showers at least once a day  I would recommend twice even if one is just a rinse in cold water hot showers will make you relapse cause if you get an erection in a very comfortable hot shower well you know whats gonna happen Abstain from sugar and any pleasure food. Keep clothes on. Do not get stressed. Do not starve yourself stay as full as ya can. The big thing too is whenever you have a trigger or lustful thingthought cut it out right then! Do not lust at all! Dont go to the beach or the pool you know why. Pick up some positive hobbies to busy yourself. Also do not try to attack an urge divert it away and do something else!I think people just attack the urge and thats not what you should do! Divert it the less you think about fappinglustanything triggering the better! That will seriously help just get in the habit of cutting bad thoughts and replacing them with good thoughts! Final thing anything and everything you thinkdo will go into your subconscious and effect your decisions later on when you fap you are gonna wanna do it again then your gonna wanna do it again this is with everything bad and good thoughts included! the first hour after you wake up is going to set you up for the rest of the day. If you just laze around then not doing anything it will not help at all and will make you have that mindset for the rest of the day. ONLY DO POSITIVE THINGS IN THE MORNING. Thinking positively before you go to bed is good too as when you sleep your subconscious is most active dont think about fapping or lust or anything triggering before bed or right when you wake up as it is most destructive then Also listen to positive music right before bedwhen you wake up if you wanna note I said positive if it is nonsense music that wont help you it wontThats another thing cut out any and every inappropriate music and replace it with good positive music. Well thats the best I can do Keep in mind Im only . Well anyways I dont think you can do it I KNOW you can do it! DO NOT LET ME DOWN! I would wish you good luck but no need to because YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN YOU WILL NOT FAPPeace            StareDude,NoFap,dbxfios,0,t5_2skrn

10215516,0,t1_dc1xbqa,It goes back to the nature of the addiction more than anything. He has told me that he doesnt want to fantasize during sex it is just a tool that he always used to stay hard. His PIED would require the fantasies in order to complete sex to the point of orgasm. During the worst parts of his addiction and PIED he wouldnt even be able to complete sex without becoming soft.At this point we do not want the dopamine hit he used in the past to become the norm. We want and have achieved successfully  times it to be all about the physical experience and the connection between us. It doesnt actually hurt me that he might imagine someone else for a brief moment but in reality we want him to be present in the moment and to avoid the brain rewiring process to be firm before any relapses.I agree that a normal man with no porn addiction can every once in a while fantasize about another woman while having sex. Now I still think that that should not be a common occurrence and can should stay private... but we are not in that normal scenario. An alcoholic cannot have just one drink. Just as a porn addict cannot have one fantasy to actually recover his brain. In My Opinion  In order for the brain to fully heal to a normal state the dopamine hits must regulate themselves to normal sexual scenarios. ,NoFap,dc1ziuy,1,t5_2skrn

After awhile I can visualize my chakras being filled with energy and eventually I feel a rush of energy up the spine all the way back down to the pelvis.

10272257,0,t3_5n28gh,This was an excellent read. I too had a dumbass fantasy for myself where everything is magically going to work out for me this excusing me to not take any responsibility for myself. Going on nofap has made me rethink that and realize that active participation in my life is the one thing that can influence what happens in my life. If Im just sitting back doing almost nothing then my future becomes very bleak. The fantasyprophecy keeps that reality from reaching my awareness. I do nothing but I dont worry about it because my future still appears bright when I picture it in my head. I actually think that this fantasy is fueled by masturbation. Masturbation in the moment makes you feel like your special like youre destined for great things in life. Cigarettes can create a similar kind of magical feeling. Going on a nofap streak and quitting smoking forces you to get real with yourself by removing you from your fantasy fuel. Those who dont fantasize realize.,NoFap,dc8f083,1,t5_2skrn

I dont want you to think im being corny or trying to save you from your feelings because I know I cant only you can make a change.

I hurt my parents at the time and if I had died I couldnt imagine the pain they would have felt. Even just thinking about it gives me a horrible feeling.

I mean sure a percentage can be blamed on porn but that would be about . Most divorces happen because of people getting married for the wrong reason or finances. Yes Porn can change your view on how you practice sex but why would you watch it in the first place if youre married or youre having a partner? Again stop blaming Porn for your mistakes. Nobody forced you to write down the url of that one site nor did anyone force you and me to watch it and jerk off to it. Its like killing someone with a knife and blaming the knife even though the knife can be used perfectly safely. No a lot of people keep it in moderation... unless youre telling me that  of the guys on this planet is living a life in misery. I never started in moderation thats why I am quitting it all together. Not because I think Porn or masturbation are the greater evil. They are your own choices nobody forced them on me or on you.,NoFap,dcewokt,0,t5_2skrn

10361987,0,t1_dcil16e,Yea I read that too. I didnt care too much since I exorzised spirits with meditation before. So I thought I at least give it a shot. You can of course consult a priest that you trust in such a case but he might as well think that you are nuts if he doesnt know anything about spirits.      Personally the prayer is probably one of the safest methods I have discovered so far. One can take as well a bath in purified water. That is even easier but I didnt try it myself since the prayer already worked and nothing was left of the spirit after the rd reading on the rd day.    Edit Okay I acquired some knowledge on how long priests take to do an excorzism. Sometimes between    years. Like wtf. Maybe that was about a really bad excorzist. Id still consult a priest if one has no knowledge on the subject.,NoFap,dcilc27,1,t5_2skrn

10415213,0,t3_5p4yo1,Theres something i think you should try to explain him if he lacks selfdiscipline but it might be hard to explain if you didnt experience it yourself  When abstaining from porn the first days are hell but he gotta keep in mind that urges usually dont last so if tell him that when he wants to watch porn he has to force himself to do something else and if he doesnt focus on the urge it will eventually go away. He shouldnt try to force urges away. The worst idea when getting an urge would be to think nah i dont want to fap NAH I DONT WANT OKAY I SAID I DONT WANT because thats a lie and you cant lie to the subconscious. I fapped only once without porn since i started nofap  months ago and i still want to look at porn. Its really about not focusing on the urges while recognizing the desire to fap or watch porn. Staying sit in front of the computer or staying alone at home in general is something to be avoided in the first days thats where the urges are the worst.Good luck,NoFap,dcomrxi,1,t5_2skrn

10445916,0,t1_dcrpx4u,After a certain amount of days usually between  for me youll start to feel really good. Youll have more energy your attention span will get a little better and other benefits like that. Then out of nowhere itll all go away and youll start to feel like you do when youre on PMO. This can last anywhere from a few days to a few months. This all varies from person to person and like the sidebar says your mileage may vary.I think in this case the best thing to do is to build some positive habits while youre not flatlining. That way when you do eventually flatline youll have some tricks up your sleeve. This can be things like reading meditating exercising etc. Exercise is extremely important as its impossible to feel energized all the time. However exercise releases endorphin which is a chemical in the brain that makes you feel more alert and awake.,NoFap,dcs4pjv,2,t5_2skrn

There will be moments and days when the temptation is so strong and it doesnt feel like it will go away. You simply have to endure it. You can do anything you want with your time it will be better than the solitary act of masturbation. Read read read. Just sit. If you have a hard time just sitting at home go to a park and just sit. Ultimately you will discover deeper parts of your mental and spiritual self that perhaps you didnt know you had. I am often tempted at night when I am just lying in bed trying to go to sleep. At those times it almost seems that I will not be able to go to sleep unless I masturbate. Recently however I have simply been allowing myself to fall asleep even while extremely tempted and lo and behold eventually you fall asleep and the temptation is long gone. It disappears. And when it disappears when you are no longer literally shaking then you will know what to do. It wont be a mystery. You will have more freedom.

10569909,0,t3_5rclux,I think that a sexschedule is something that will really depend on the person but if youve noticed that more than  times a week has a negative impact on you then its probably a sign to stop doing that. gt What would you say is the best way to keep high dopamine levels and be as happy as possible?Exercise and socialising works pretty well for me and sometimes even posingflexing in the mirror after showering helps give a confidence boost as well as childish as that sounds. Speaking of showering also look into taking cold showers if you havent already theyve been reported as having positive moodaltering effects as well. My last one might sound a bit strange but I find working to have mood boosting effects as well as the sense of achievement that I get after the accomplishment makes it more than worth the struggle in the longrun for me at least. Good luck I hope I was able to help.,NoFap,dd67beb,2,t5_2skrn

10692653,0,t1_ddigdvw,You dont need willpower you need discipline. Dont expect to break the cycle and succeed if youre not ready to get out of your comfort zone and fight for it. Go to the gym take cold showers meditate and keep busy ! I was in the same situation as you but I realised that saying I have zero willpower wouldnt lead me anywhere and I couldnt wait for the day where I would suddenly have willpower to stop  because it probably wouldnt come and the absence of willpower itself is one of the consequences of PMO so basically it would be even worse if I waited more. Same goes for the lack of energy. After one or two weeks I started gaining energy and willpower. Those are actually benefits youll get from nofap and you have to fight for them. Everything has a price If you want to stop PMO you have to do what is necessary you have to recognize your triggers and get rid of anything that can lead you to relapsing. I deleted instagram and gag because I relapsed a lot of times because of them. You have to choose between keeping them and giving yourself room for a relapse or deleting them and guaranteeing success. Dont even think about it just delete them youll feel great after trust me. Also get rid of videogames and all that stuff or at least limit the time you spend playing. With all those things in mind there would be no other path than success. Dont have a negative state of mind and have thoughts like people dont like me i cant do this. Once you do what is necessary to succeed you will succeed. Dont rely on motivation rely on discipline. Motivation is temporary meanwhile discipline is a muscle you can forge. Later on youll meet new people and make new friends you trust. Dont forget what I told you. If youre on this subreddit you should already have read enough posts to make you stop. I guess you dont give it enough attention. I told you what you should do now decide between kepping the cycle and hating yourself for it  or fighting and becoming a brand new person a person youd be proud of. A good happy life is waiting for you and you know what you have to do. Good luck. ,NoFap,ddiv9l4,1,t5_2skrn

10713701,0,t1_ddkp9s5,Its still there for me aswell but it has diminished to quite an extent.It also distorted my world view a bit aswell.I remember that time and it was the worse.I couldnt even talk to my best friend properly because i was thinking him as a bull and my girlfriend as my mistress.Even now the line i have typed above my heart beat got a bit fast but i didnt feel anything down there.Which shows the fetish has quite diminished but its still not over.I wouldnt do it aswell.Id rather die than to become a cuck.This fetish is one of the most destructive in my opinion.My porn experience was always restricted towards normal sex but as time passed and my girlfriend kind of dumped me while i was madly in love with her finding cuckold porn and getting aroused by it seemed kind of something that one could expect.I am ashamed of this.If anyone i know finds out about this ill be embarassed and theyll be shocked as hell aswell.Every one who knows me will be shocked to their core if they find out about this.I used to search about cuckold porn where the cuck has to suck the bull while the mistress is enjoying.As i am writing this my heart beat again has risen which again proves the fetish is still there but it has lost the control it once had on me.But this fetish i think will take some time to finish completely.I would like to talk about this issue with you if you are comfortable.Would love to know your side of the story as well Sorry for the long reply.,NoFap,ddl1dzc,2,t5_2skrn

There are tons of dudes here who havent ever had luck with girlswomen and some of them are in their s or s. Youre . Just chill out and realize that a lot of what youre experiencing is actually selfinflicted. No one is that fucking bad looking or socially awkward. As much as you feel like others have robbed you youve done a lot of this to yourself as a lot of us have. Im not perfect I can admit to it.Look. Of course experiences in your life will change your perceptions. Thats kinda what they do. But again the more you sit on something negative the worse itll get and the more of an adverse effect it can and will have on your future.For what its worth I personally havent had what I consider a real friend in years either. As a matter of fact my situation is kinda fucked in that people have this tendency to come back to me after I no longer give a fuck about reshaping anything of a friendship with them. This often happens after they come to realize what jackasses they were or that others they considered better friends are twofaced or simply not what they came off to be at a time before. I get the whole thing about feeling like youve got no one to hang out with confide in etc. But clearly some people just arent meant to be in your life.

So the sex ED most likely wont grab the attention of a long term user and if it does theyll probably go watch other stuff after. But what about people just starting? Perhaps but the way I found it back in  was through google images. I think thats how most kids find it before the internet it was pretty difficult get stay up late and hope to not be caught on the television VHS tapes Magazines ect and there was a monetary wall. All of these things cost money and they where really risky affairs because getting caught with it was murder. Now any kid with an Ipad can find some crazy shit for FREE its insane.

Look at your days without PMO or edging as a first stage and with the clean brain you can start with edging where you must learn to masturbate concentrating on the sensations and NOT IN SEXUAL FANTASTIES    I have not applied this personally but thats what I plan to do.

What youd get from them is synthetic drugs andor suggestions to get procedures done. Same thing goes for specialists such as urologists. Far and away the biggest problem with these people is that they are absolutely oblivious with regard to the fact that everything is interconnected even the human biological system.In any case just do your research. Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine physicians may be able to help you if some abstinence doesnt do the trick. Read books and educate yourself first though.

10973386,0,t3_5wp66j,Hey Im like you.  years old discovered porn at the age of  when I got my first computer. And as you know life has been downhill ever since.It wasnt until I became truly serious about nofap and my diet in general that I was able to get out of this seemingly eternal slump.For clarity I havent masturbated since semptember   so I think that makes it around  days? And I havent watched porn for much longer than that.I find to truly free yourself and connect with other people the first step is admittance. Admitting you are far behind others socially and even intellectually and work harder than they do to improve. This was and actually still is a struggle because I wanted to believe that I was normal on the same level of social ability and mental processing as someone who hadnt been through what I have. But the truth is porn and overstimulation robbed of us of that. The good news is that were taking it back and if we ever want to be on the same level as the people around you that do great things youll have to work even harder than they do.Im at a point where I have a strict life strict diet strict discipline strict time schedules strict exercise because theres so much I have to do to catch up and if I drop the ball for even one day my chances to catch up could potentially implode. The number one thing to do is reduce all kinds of stimulation not just PMO. Im talking about tv music video games internet forums recently had to quit chan because I spent  hrs daily and Im working to getting reddit under  hour basically anything you can think of that doesnt require your brain to be working hard to solve a problem or some kind of social face to face activity.Im improving daily by living life this way. ,NoFap,debu8ne,4,t5_2skrn

Usually because Im having a bad week and dont feel like slowing down to actually feel or process whats going on in the back of my mind. Not a good idea to avoid your problems when youre doing NoFap.

If you do mindfulness sure enough can help giving you the skill of just experiencing the anger without acting on it.

11147863,0,t3_5z3l87,I think it is more complicated than that. I think everyone has a place in the hierarchy and our subconscious mind sees this. For women its mainly based on attractiveness and status. For men its many things.You feel nervous in their presence because your mind knows they are higher up than you. She is a gorgeous woman so she can find a higher status male than you or call many lesser men at the click of a button. If it comes to that she will overpower you. While you know deep down you are a low testosterone boy who spends time fapping to pixel women procrastinating on dopamine baits with not that much physical power at all. Thats not pedestalising thats your lizard brain surviving. You do that with higher value men too.Now she may be doing all those things too except the fapping part maybe she is shlocking addict yet she is still higher than you in the pecking order because shes an attractive woman. Deal with it.Ever since I started my NoFap journey two things happened. My testosterone levels have started going back into normal. My selfimage also changed. Obviously there have been many changes I have brought into my life since then which boosted my selfimage even more. Needless to say I dont pedestalize banyb woman at all I havent met supermodels yet though. Problem is solved. Before NoFap I knew I was pedestalising women but I still couldnt help it. The trick is not in the knowing and bypassing the system the trick is in knowing and improving your value within the system.,NoFap,devljup,2,t5_2skrn

Sure if two people are perfectly happy with their lives and they decide to engage in consensual noncommittal sex then that is fine.

11154136,0,t3_5z42hu,I think it all comes down to your core values. Know what you want in life and what you look for in people will make you more confident which will make you less of a nice guy and you will start putting yourself first without being a complete asshole. By knowing what you look for in people you will quickly recognize the real and you will avoidput less effort into those that dont have your best interest. Also knowing your long term goals and actually chasing them will bring confidence as you will know you are in the right path to greatness and success which will bring confidence and help you realize that most people are insecure themselves and dont know what the fuck their doing for example your bosses being dicks to you or friends treating you like your less than themtaking advantage of you you will realize that most people project their insecurities on others. ,NoFap,dewb5ls,1,t5_2skrn

Some of my weird shit growing up would make your list seem like a walk in the park and I turned out normal. I sucked a dick wore diapers and pissed in them then masturbated did fantasize about being a girl and wore my sisters underwear and jacked off in them. had wet dreams about sucking my own dick ate my own cum came on some kids head while he was sleepingAfter I started doing drugs sucked another dick while on adderal  shoved this gay guys toothbrush up my ass and jerked off while I was on ecstasy  tried to rape a girl while we were both drunk and on adderal didnt do it at the last second had sex with  women fucked a girl in the ass with a condom onAfter I quit doing drugs had sex with over  women started fucking girls in the ass without a condom on.  peed on a girls face started bdsm and choking girls for pleasure and they liked it. started having girls lick and finger my asshole and using a butt plug. somehow didnt get any stds had to leave some illegal shit out that I dont know if it would get me into trouble if I mentioned it.After I got a girl pregnant settled down stopped having sex with more than one women. realized that sex is a waste of time and its empty.  started mastering my basic instincts. chasing money now instead of women still with my baby momma and we might get married soon. went veganI left a lot of stuff out and just plain forgot a lot of stuff do to drug use but you get the point. The shit you are going through is normal. It doesnt mean you are trans. If you dont meet the typical standard of manly that doesnt mean shit. Ive never been manly. Im a nerd that likes to play video games and watch Big Bang theory. And Ive had plenty of feminine moments. If you want to be trans then be trans. More power to you.

Reaching some sort of milestone streak is not what cures addiction which is an incredibly dark complicated and misunderstood ailment. Abstinence and sobriety are a must but they are but the vessel that true recovery happens in not recovery itself.In other words you need to find out why you were addicted in the first place and do some deep soulsearching and develop an awareness of the self. You have to dig deep and find the roots of your addiction and pull them out to the light. You have to understand yourself on a level far deeper than youve ever been able to.

For the others who read this just a short intro to the idea  the multilayer brain follows the animals evolution first came the reptiles and their brain basically dominated the basic instincts eat run fuck then came the mammalian brain layer  this layer is more sophisticated and drives the building of social structures s.a. family horde society in this layer emotions come into play the last layer is the Homo Sapiens layer the ones that we have developed  it is responsible for the abstract matter of things e.g. the concept of time the concept of religionsoul the exploration of the invisible. The idea of the theory is that the more inner the layer is the more dominant it is e.g. if you have to chose between running from a predator or remaining to help a group member not to get eaten your instinct will be to save yourself first.

11437637,0,t1_dfsdmbb,I completely agree that sex sells and that sex is in the bottom of everything so to say. BUT dont you think that we need to regulate it in some way ?  years ago we still had internet no smart phones but still a lot of content around us and sex wasnt literally EVERYWHERE as it is now. Regular channels of communiation back then were rather clean. Nowdays the regular channels  facebook instagram youtube dont get me started on ass videos on youtube are completely loaded with sexual content from top to bottom. This amplification has become more than just using the internet as a medium I think that whoevers or whatever agenda is being pushed now more than ever we are being affected by nudity and violence but that is another topic. I dont want to sound like a conspiracy theorist but I think that the combination between high speed internet smartphones and social media has kind of hit the sweet spot into the demise of both men and women. nothing religions as well just making a point. The problem I have is that this is so massive and widespread that I dont feel normal anymore denying it. Mark my words people like me will be the minority soon and mediocrity will do its job. I just need to think of some sort of strategy to avoid all this... I love women but why am I supposed to look at asses in yoga pants when I open facebook ? I dont want to be overstimulated all the time when Im trying to read the news or connect with friends.. This has to stop.. How do I prevent a  year old from not copying what a fitness model does ?

He said he became less coward and lazy as a result of it. I can relate to the increase of energy confidence motivation. I feel like NoFap gives you such a boost it makes everything so much more enjoyable and easy even the challenges especially the challenges because you feel much more confident and you dont just give up before even trying.

11528405,0,t3_64jk1g,This triggered me a bit. I understand you wrote this for yourself and while many points you make are valid a lot of it just doesnt make sense.Fasting is unhealthy unless its part of your religion like even then... nevermind haha dont intentionally starve yourself.Feeling emotions are important but not that important. I dont believe sitting in them without any distraction is good for anyones mental wellbeing. Yes grieve a little but get over it quickly as mourning for long is a waste of time and is rather pathetic.Watch movies listen to music eat good food look at art if you find the right pieces youll be thinking more about the world in new perspectives and may come to better resolve to your own personal problems whilst thinking about others as well.Reading is also incredibly useful. Knowledge n general creativity as well as developing insight are among the many good reasons to read AND I dont think the answers to the questions your asking are going to help you in any way If you do get them. God is mean pain exists as a defence mechanism love keeps humans being humans your childhood probably isnt how youll remember it because we as humans skew our memories to fit our personas and understanding. You cannot tell which women are empty by the way their eyes look and even then what has being empty got to do with anything? Many people who are dead inside are still great people and worth your time. Meeting girls is hard and yes dont objectify them and dont fall victim to generalising and trying to feel superior over them.Keep your friends regardless of how deep your friendship is with them. Go out for the sake of going out unless you really dont want to. Im learning that is good to be out when you can because theres a lot to learn from being about.Be honest with people but dont be rudemean about it make sure your intentions are in the right place MAKE SURE YOUR INTENTIONS ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE.You gotta dance.Not listening to music in the car is also kind of unnecessary. Why inflict that upon yourself unless you dont enjoy music?Of course stay pmo free as much as possible meditate talk to people leave your house read question questions worth questioning and acknowledge your emotions. Dont deprive yourself of anything that doesnt really harm you Distractions and pleasure are just as vital to life as drive and determination. Good luck uwsbaam,NoFap,dg2qw1v,1,t5_2skrn

I quit for a whole year  no PMO.  Happiest year of my life but very difficult too.  I eventually started relapsing again and getting addicted again for years but now Im back.My advice is keep yourself busy.  Get some activities in your life that force you to get out of your house and be with other people.  Take a cold shower or sit in a cold bath when you get a strong urge or blue balls.  Talk to people on reddit and read peoples stories to inspire yourself.  And remember it will be worth it.  You will  feel so much better.  ,NoFap,dg2s6hn,1,t5_2skrn

11586701,0,t3_65c3cn,gt I wont ever beat this I thinkThat thought in your brain is the only thing you are required to beat.  Otherwise success is just a matter of time.  If you have the philosophy I will continue nofap until Im successful and youre able to maintain that philosophy long term even through the tough parts then the logical conclusion is that you WILL be successful eventually.  Patience and selfacceptance are criticalhalf of your relapses are probably caused because you want to comfort yourself or distract yourself when you have feelings of defeat and failure.  Once you accept your current place and you develop the patience to stickwithit for the long term then half of those relapses wont happen in the first place.  Dont compare yourself to your friend.  Hes probably on reddit right now complaining about how his OTHER friend is so much better at him in another area of life and he doesnt even appreciate how easy nofap is for him just like you might not appreciate the strengths you have.I hope that doesnt sound preachy just trying to kickstart your brain for you  negativity creates a feedback loop in our head and sometimes we just need to be shocked out of it with some alternative perspective. ,NoFap,dg9cyr6,2,t5_2skrn

11725601,0,t3_676qgg,Hey man I know that feeling I went through a similar situation at my senior prom. The girl I was planning on going with before I asked her got asked by one of my friends. I talked to her and she said she was planning on me asking her and would have went with me. I was so ticked that someone who heard me talk about asking her went ahead of me to get with her. So flashforeward to prom night I was there and danced my heart out. My would be date got prom queen and I honestly lost it. Jealously is a vice I struggle with and instead of being happy for her I was pissed that I missed my only opportunity. Once the last song played I sucked it up and stole the last dance with her. Ever since then she hated me. Havent truly spoke to her or that one friend in about a year. Her whole friend group doesnt think too highly of me either but that is fine. Trust me man college is a new opportunity to build a new life. Spite is one hell of an emotion and with spite you can rise up and become a better person.

11779618,0,t1_dgv8p96,Not actually Im on day  of hardmode and  of nofap. I had sex one time with a female friend  rounds and got  blowjobs other day during that period before abstain completely from sex.Im not willing to have sex but Ive dates set this weekend and if it go further Im not going to stop and probably gonna have sex. But Id prefer not to.And yeah I guess were totally on the same boat. This is my longest streak ever and Im not expecting to recover in  days too I guess weve been fucking ourselves up and we just need more time to heal. But well definitely heal.Ive been PMOing since my  years Im almost  so... yeah Ive my piece of fault and Im patient about the process. Hope to read your report when you get better.,NoFap,dgv99rc,2,t5_2skrn

11785494,0,t1_dgvnv7k,You dont get out of it completely.You just get short bursts of the opposite .For me these bursts are random.Still I havent reached the levels of my teenager years.But Im beggining to think that because I entered adulthood while being a porn addict maybe I just never felt how a adult libido feels like .Remember when you were a kid and your hormones were at normal levels?If you feel like itit makes total sense.Yours hormones were normal peeked during your teenager years and then dropped again.,NoFap,dgvxav5,1,t5_2skrn

11786813,0,t3_6868t9,Do not allow porn to circulate in your mind this is the first defeat and path to a slippery slope. Your first line of defense is blocking out those thoughts from your mind. Dissociate porn from a positive feeling to the negative emotions that come after pmo. Your fourteen you have a whole life ahead of you dont let porn sap your youth right out from under you. Look to the future and envision yourself years from now porn free. Dont become a  year old like me still battling and slowly losing life to porn with each relapsed. One love,NoFap,dgw2owo,1,t5_2skrn
