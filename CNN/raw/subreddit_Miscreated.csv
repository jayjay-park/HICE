WW Nuke or not. But the reason why I dont think it should have been a Neutron bomb that was used is because they state that its a Wasteland  There is a difference between that and ThisDont get me wrong Im all for them using Neutron bombs in the game.

6717667,0,t1_d0e4jr7,You dont need to be a fresh spawn to group up with other freshies normally fresh spawn players are willing to interact with armed players because they have nothing to lose anyway. So if you come across an unarmed player see if they sound friendly and offer to team up. When ever i stumble upon a fresh player i give them some spare items. Not only is it a good way to make friends but its also a kind gesture that inspires other players to be friendly as well. I have even given guns to players i just met and had no problems. Not the safest thing to do but i find most players actually dont like to back stab people that trust them. Of course you still have the occasional d bag so use good judgement and keep your gun ready.Also check this reddit and other forums for people who are looking for others to play with theres plenty! cheers.,Miscreated,d0e5y3q,2,t5_2w4h4

8291696,0,t3_4sy8th,I had a few ideas about this.I dont think the person logging out should be punished as there can be legitimate reasons to quickly exit. But perhaps the game could detect the time from the previous log out so if its been less than an hour since you last logged out when you log in your body is visible for a few seconds before you can start playing.Another idea I had was to use the sleeping bags you see around the map as a visual clue. Why not place a sleeping bag where you logged out? And when you log in it plays a little animation of it getting rolled and packed up during the synchronisation stage. You could then see when the person was about to log in and cap them.This gives players a visual clue as to where a potential combat logger quit out but doesnt punish players who had a legitimate reason for quickly exiting the game. It also make you think more seriously about where to log out so your sleeping bag isnt out in the open.,Miscreated,d5e0rfu,1,t5_2w4h4
8322970,0,t3_4tebvb,That is something I have been thinking about for quite some time now. Not only in miscreated but all survival Games. What I would like to see is somekind of escape offering a happy Ending for your character instead of death by pvp. Lets say a dynamic helo Spawn with a Pilot and ongoing Rotors and shining flares. Then combine this with Steam achievements like kill  survivors before escaping or survive  h before surviving and so on.

I havent played those much but Ive heard many folks on here say that Miscreated is what those should have been.As for me  I have x as many hours in Miscreated than I put into my previous obsessions namely Fallout  Skyrim and Dont starve.  This is my kind of game and totally worth it.That said... the sales seem to come frequently enough and there are new things being released in the game all the time.  Its worth far more than  but if you wait a bit Im sure you could get it soon for  again.,Miscreated,dcn9706,1,t5_2w4h4

10588173,0,t3_5rgmjb,Base building in Miscreated is very buggy and frankly broken. Id say they need to develop a new system or at least improve the current system before something like this program is created. I used to be quite the Rust fanatic upwards of  hours and I used this program towards the end of my time with Rust and it can definitely inspire some great designs and being able to test their raid endurance is a great feature. Hope to see some improvement on the Miscreated base building. Cheers ,Miscreated,dd837je,3,t5_2w4h4

10676090,0,t1_ddfdtwr,Id agree with this except your valuable items arent safely tucked away because anyone with an axe can break into a base very easily.As it stands now base building is incredibly time consuming and not worth it unless you put in the time to make a floating base.,Miscreated,ddh5pbt,1,t5_2w4h4

10964844,0,t1_deau1lz,Might work sometimes but many people have lost their bases.  After the devs said interacting with the box would reset the timer we stopped actively placing itemschairsetc and packing them backup.  A day or  later the base disappeared.

11036992,0,t1_dej0p3c,Knowing where to look for weapons and what spawn locations are where comes with playtime. Ive put around  hours into this game and I only started knowing how to get geared relatively quick at around the  hour mark. Look up tutorials on gun spawns and loot spawns and play more. Dont just write off that theres no loot because youre incompetent. ,Miscreated,dej0uz8,0,t5_2w4h4
11083698,0,t1_demtonw,So lets break it down gaming for  hours a week thats  hours a night average.  If you sleep a normal  hours a night that leaves  hours to do something productive.  Im guessing Darmaniac has no job or maybe a part time job since full time  hours a day means hed have  whole hours to care for his child.  Even part time  hour days only leaves  hours to care for a kid run errands and keep shit together.Calling it now  hes a neglectful asshole who spends more money and time on computer shit while his kid wastes away or digs through the trash for scraps.  I guess leveling up in video games is more important than caring for a living person and being an actual father instead of what amounts to a lazy worthless sperm donor.,Miscreated,deobsnf,5,t5_2w4h4

11179434,0,t1_deyuarx,In my opinion the Miscreated community is MUCH better than Rust. Theres lots of different server types. If PvE is your play style theres plenty of servers that focus more on role playing. If someone kills you on sight just tell the admins on teamspeak and they will investigate. In some servers Ive played in the admins can check the game logs and see who shot first. If you are wanting to play PvP theres servers for that. Some that offer  hours daylight some that only allow players to be in first person some servers only allow PvP in certain areas of the map such as the airfield or Hayward Valley. ,Miscreated,dez6cu7,1,t5_2w4h4
11281955,0,t3_60wx94,Hi If you look in the config editor on the id panel at id.net you can enable the whitelistThen to add playersUse the Miscreated Rcon Select your server then just add via the command miswhitelistadd steam  id  This then also saves them to your list in the config editor on your id panel.This way you will not need to restart the server otherwise doing it the config editor you will have to restart after adding.Hope that helps,Miscreated,dfask29,3,t5_2w4h4
11347160,0,t3_61xyvn,I like the idea just wanted to say me and a few friends have just opened up a  slot server and were looking for some regular players. Would you fancy joining up with us with this idea instead of using yours if youre the only person paying for it?? Might be best talking to one of the subreddit mods too.,Miscreated,dfi6hx2,1,t5_2w4h4

Im dealing with the exact same problem as you except Im on a I GTX   GB ram and I got the game installed on my ssd.Like you said in the other reply my game also almost freezes when Im shooting my gun so that makes PVP impossible for me too.

11681817,0,t1_dgk56ap,Doesnt any gun currently get  hit kill with a headshot? So even a player with  hours of play could kill an established player with lets say  storage boxes if he finds a . pistol with  round and has good reaction time and aim? If youre going for skill based why not go for the battle royale approach rather than an open world game? Seems like thats where youve failed to find the right balance. Im not asking for unlimited storage just a fair amount of storage. I dont think my suggestions in the original post take away from skill and they certainly add a significant amount replayability and progression for players who love this genre.,Miscreated,dgk5fpr,6,t5_2w4h4
11683816,0,t1_dgkd0p8,I dont see it that way. I might be a little forward but Im not wrong. Seemed like he didnt really consider my suggestion anyway and he also contradicted other posts by other devs so Im not sure about the factual part. ,Miscreated,dgkdlyn,3,t5_2w4h4
