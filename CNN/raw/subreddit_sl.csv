I love your understatementOne thing the farewell of Rod has shown is that Linden Lab still has a big problem communicating with its population.Sadly everything the Lindens seem to do reinforces the old saying that Second Life is the best business run out of a garage ever. People knock public relations as a profession but if you track  rpublicrelations youd see people anguishing over how to communicate effectively and well on behalf of organizations. Linden Labs comes from a time before public relations almost like its a roleplay of s management. Its so odd for an organization that has been so cutting edge.,sl,cf2hu62,2,t5_bi84
