Once I got rid of people that insisted on pointing out how lazy I am I decided that I ether get  hours of sleep and function at least somewhat or sleep less and spend my life sitting all day staring at a wall.,TBI,ciq8c27,2,t5_2xbl6

Im sure they dont realize this when they say it but your situation is not their concern. It sounds like he got very lucky hes lucky to have you and that youre both doing well.

3821969,0,t1_cqrw2l8,Thanks unfortunately Im only a sophomore in college so I have a few years to go with that but Im glad the summer is approaching soon. I definitely am happy that Im cognitively the same and I try to put some of my issues into perspective but Ive been through  different rehabs and Im a person who firmly believes that there is obviously an underlying issues with these headaches I just havent found them yet. Im also looking into seeing a psychologistpsychiatrist. If you dont mind me asking how serious was your injury? My frustration has been that I do feel decent some days and other days I feel almost like day  with pain. Im not sure if there is any correlation between the severity of the injury and how long the symptoms last but I feel like my injury wasnt as bad as a lot of people here. I didnt lose consciousness I have full memory of the incident I just started getting headaches that Ive never had in my life about  weeks after the incident.,TBI,cqrxq2c,1,t5_2xbl6

6513775,0,t1_czoex79,I hope you didnt interpret my comment as criticism when I said that ten years is far too long to be waiting.

7270382,0,t3_4evgco,This sounds like quite the quandary. There are two major aspects which need to be addressed here. The first one is you and the second is your husband.Im going to start with you here because despite living with a TBI myself and hoping that awareness and support for those who suffer the injury increases I realize what I think is most important here. You. I dont want to sound insensitive towards his needs but I think this is the harsh truth.You have the right intentions in mind and it sounds like you are putting up with and doing as much as you can in order to help the man who Im sure you love and the one who you pledged to spend the rest of your life with. Your compassion is great so dont let your own mind or anything that someone else says trick you into believing that you are not trying to help. Its obvious that you are trying to do the right thing.That said if you at any time fear for yourself get the hell away at least for a short period until your husband can cool down. Just because you want to help does not mean that it is your duty to take any type of verbal emotional or physical abuse including threats. You have already been injured and have already had the cops called on you. Neither of those are ok.Protect yourself. You cant help him if you cant protect yourself from him or his actions. Therapy appointments are frowned upon by some people but they can be very helpful in working out the thoughts in your own mind. Go see a personal therapist andor go through marriage therapy with your husband only if you feel comfortable doing so.Again he is making threats towards you and claiming you make threats towards him and calling the cops. Keep a journal of everything that happens between you and your husband. Write down your interactions with him both good and bad. Keep the journal in a different location from your husbands residence where you know it will be safe. A friends house maybe. Dont tell anybody about it. Dont let anyone know it exists unless its needed to keep it safe. And if god forbid you at any time feel like your marriage is in jeopardy like you will not be able to tolerate it any longer lawyer up. At the very least get some type of consultation as to what your options are if you feel this way. Dont put yourself through hell just to be there for him. Do what you can and if there is nothing else you can do then let it be. The records which you have been keeping will help in this situation or any other legal situation which may arise such as one due to a significant injury. These are worst case scenarios obviously and lets hope it doesnt come to this but you need to CYA. Hopefully his family is on your side as well should anything worse happen.Now your husband. I would like to first say that no advice that anyone on here can give you can trump the advice of a proper medical professional. I think that he should have been placed in inpatient rehabilitation before coming home. A TBI is a significant injury that cant be healed in  days in the ICU  days on a medical floor and  weeks in rehab. Minor concussions can show symptoms for some time and recovering from a significant TBI is a process which takes a long time. And even down the line he will probably never heal  and get back to being who he was before the injury. I dont know what your options are or how he would react to the suggestion but I think that either you or his family should try to get him back under professional care. Physical therapy occupational therapy speech therapy  monitoring proper nutrition all of these things are available at a good rehab center. Or maybe go talk to a medical professional or psychiatrist who may be able to help him with his outbursts. The point is you should seek the advice of professionals.Once again from my position and with my limited medical knowledge I cannot diagnose this properly but it sounds like your husband may possibly have a dependency problem. A TBI can increase the likelihood of dependency so the pain pills may be causing an addiction problem. When combined with the lack of impulse control and the lack of self awareness and other affects of a TBI it seems like a good recipe for what you described in relation to him trying to get more pills. Talk to a doctor and see if there are nonnarcotic options that can help your husband properly if you feel like pain pills are a problem. Over medication of narcotics is a real problem and mixing medications can have negative affects as well so make sure he is taking ones that are ok to mix.,TBI,d24lcyg,1,t5_2xbl6

7908177,0,t3_4mzsac,Again not a medical professional per se but is there a chance the seizures are nonepileptic in nature? You report you have a predisposition i.e brain surgeries to seizures but is it the psychological trauma of the TBIgaps in memorydistress that could be causing the seizures? Nonepileptic seizures arent someone faking it its a genuine response to trauma but doesnt have a neurological basis which it sounds like youve been tested for. Might be worth looking into.,TBI,d44ycvh,1,t5_2xbl6

9282480,0,t3_57h990,Figured out how to actually inhale and tried some about  years post injury with my sister no idea what the strain was but felt like it basically turned off my symptoms and was the most Ive ever felt like my brain fog lifted or I felt like there was a break from the disassociation state I feel like Ive been in for  years as of now no anxiety comparatively depression seemed to take a brief break though I was just chilling at my sisters house and didnt feel like I could make much of the opportunity outside of Netflix or whatever we were doing.A few months later Id been smoking somewhat regularly different and probably worse weed I suspect the first stuff was lower THC not having anywhere near the same experience. I was almost over a cold had had a single beer about half an hour prior was on sertraline and had my first seizure fell off some stairs a little way hitting my face a little just superficial injuries had a panic attack and spent  hours waiting around in hospital and havent driven a car since that was May of  especially as Ive had  smaller seizures without sertraline or weed.So basically even for one person with a TBI severe right frontal lobe in my case the experience can differ greatly depending on circumstances.,TBI,d8sme30,1,t5_2xbl6

11342279,0,t3_61gujl,About the time of my TBI I had decided to shift my career into a side path which required more schooling a year if going fulltime two years  if going parttime and was checking into schools.I took my first course about  years later to see how I would fare. My memory short and longterm was still terrible and my organizational skills were few but I forged ahead.  I remember understanding what the professor was saying and taking copious notes during every class but a few days later I couldnt really remember much or make heads or tails out of my notes so I had to study hard to remember anything.  I ended up practically failing the final due to being very stressed out I literally watched the letters on the page melt and was unable to read the questions but the professor passed me because of my good attendance and my interest in the subject he told me he was shocked when I did so poorly on the test when he was sure I understood what he was discussing.  Back then there were no accommodations for people with disabilities. Although Im not sure what couldve done to help because my brain wasnt ready.I gave it a rest and then began the treatments that helped my brain heal.  More than a year later I started the next course which was more activity than notetaking like a lab....it was a hands on doing something class rather than lecturememorization.  I had to work very very hard but I managed to get an A and then took the next course got an A etc.  I finished all of the courses in a little over two years even though I was working at the time. I didnt have much spare time but it didnt matter then because my friends had long since evaporated or moved away and I was at the beginning of starting my new life with my new brain which was still in the process of healing.So if youve had a bad experience I encourage you to follow the good advice already given here and try again.  Dont give up. ,TBI,dfhmlqm,2,t5_2xbl6

Fluid accumulates in the inner ear that causes a lot of dizziness. Have you also seen a neuro optometrist?

11581782,0,t1_dg8rebf,My mum had cancer decades ago and some of her experiences associated with that made her not trust medical staff. Now shes convinced that my TBI symptoms are actually a problem with my thyroid and I need some kind of alternative therapy vitamins etc. Were a small family and I dont think my dad understands the situation any better. I didnt want to see my parents when I was in the hospital because they would have pulled some operatic selfcentered drama there and I didnt have the strength to deal with it. I loved every nurse who worked on me so much just the thought of my parents haranguing them was unbearable to me. I mean I was aware that nurses can actually handle emotional shouty people since they work with sick people and doctors. I just didnt want my parents there. I figured if Ill die soon I get to choose how I spend my last days and by god they will not be spent comforting anyone else. This probably is a coping mechanism or stress reaction for her yeah youre right. Im just really disappointed to find that she is still so immature that her emotions stop her from thinking or doing a bit of research. I cant do her thinking for her. I wish she was able to offer support instead of making up constant new demands on my limited time and energy.,TBI,dg8svjn,1,t5_2xbl6
