3997799,0,t3_3696c7,Second year Computing here I cant answer your question fully but I can tell you what I do know. Theres a basic Architecture course in first year and an optional more advanced one come second year. If youre interested in Architecture I think youd like it since both courses are led by this guy although he doesnt mention teaching first years so that might have changed. The interesting part is that he offered to take applications from us second years to be part of his research project over the summer. I dont know if hell make the same kind of offer for you eventually but it shows the kind of stuff that can happen.Regarding switching courses I dont know much but this page says youd need the agreement of both departments. Id assume the earlier you ask to switch the easier it would be.Hope I could help if you have any questions about anything else feel free to ask.,Imperial,crbzc7c,2,t5_2rp5z
