11689666,0,t1_dgkub55,Maybe since you are in Canada you are unaware that policies are different in the States. Or maybe you simply misunderstood what I am talking about. In either case you could ask for clarification instead of judge or assume.If I want to do a direct donation with my donor why am I disallowed but the straight couple is given permission? And how exactly do you characterize such a fact as not being discriminatory? As my RE put it I am already spermexposed because I have done an insemination whether I am putting sperm in a soft cup or having sex with him. Whether I am romantically involved with the donor is completely beside the point. If I have already used his sperm for the purpose of becoming pregnant what difference does it make from a safetyexposure risk standpoint whether we had sex to put it there? Bottom line by using his sperm I take on the same risk that a straight couple would if attempting to do a direct donation. A direct donation is simply that a donation made available for immediate use no quarantine. If straight couples are allowed to do it because they have sex with each other in other words the woman uses said mans sperm to make a baby there is literally no difference between that in terms of risk if I inseminate using a soft cup with a donors sperm. In that regard we are in fact quite intimate. You may disagree but you have no place judging me or being rude. Furthermore reproductive associations as well as medical board and states agree that preventing me access is discriminatory based on my only risk factor being that I use donor sperm. Recommendations to allow donor sperm to be used for direct donation have been made and states now have laws on the books to prevent said discrimination from occurring. I have no idea why you take such issue with that. It might be time to take a step back and reexamine what you are bringing into this space. Is it helpful and supportive? Or is it negative and toxic?,queerception,dgl1i8u,0,t5_3h5uz
