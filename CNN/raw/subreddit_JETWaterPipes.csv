There is some very legitimate engineering with this device yes its going away from what is custom with glass but shit it hits with the best of them and IT WONT BREAK. You can take it apart for easy cleaning you dont worry about where to pick it up from you can get different bowls dab attachments its a damn versatile piece. ,JETWaterPipes,cp0hh7x,3,t5_2vi9q
3895033,0,t1_cr09krx,If you believe its frozen because of gunk and such Id recommend rinsing the entire core with iso alcohol higher percentage the better I use  to try and rinse some of the organics out.      If that doesnt help Id ask the Jet folk.  I dont know what else to do that wouldnt be destructive.,JETWaterPipes,cr09nld,1,t5_2vi9q

5847980,0,t1_cxm70us,Yeah I played around with it for a little bit by hand and I couldnt get it to screw down any more. Think using tools to maybe get it to screw down more would damage it? ,JETWaterPipes,cxm75md,1,t5_2vi9q

6556879,0,t3_43r9xo,Are you filling from the top tube or are you filling from where the bowl goes because if youre filling from where the bowl goes a little bit of water gets caught in the white part that slides down and when you slide it down the water leaks down so it looks like its coming from the joint at the base. So if thats the problem you should fill from the top tube!,JETWaterPipes,czxj9ww,1,t5_2vi9q

11178941,0,t3_5zlq8e,I have a short tube with  stacks and I love it. The jet is very smooth without stacks but with stacks it feels like youre just breathing in air its so smooth. If youre mainly using the jet as a house piece get the stacks. But if you want it to be more portable dont get them because they make the piece dirty quicker and hold the smell of bong water if not rinsed.,JETWaterPipes,dez4cft,2,t5_2vi9q
